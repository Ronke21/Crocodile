<text>The Battle of Hanau was fought from 30 to 31 October 1813 between Karl Philipp von Wrede&#x27;s Austro-Bavarian corps and Napoleon&#x27;s retreating French during the War of the Sixth Coalition.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig earlier in October, Napoleon began to retreat from Germany into France and relative safety. Wrede attempted to block Napoleon’s line of retreat at Hanau on 30 October. Napoleon arrived at Hanau with reinforcements and defeated Wrede’s forces. On 31 October Hanau was in French control, opening Napoleon’s line of retreat.

The Battle of Hanau was an important tactical victory allowing Napoleon’s depleted army to retreat onto French soil to prepare to face an invasion of France.

==Background==

The Battle of Leipzig, the largest and bloodiest encounter of the Napoleonic Wars, began on 16 October 1813, raged for three days and ended with a decisive victory for the Sixth Coalition. Napoleon was forced to abandon central Germany to the coalition and hastily retreated westwards. His strategy was to regroup all his available forces on the shores of the Rhine, where his lines of communication would be shorter and his rear less likely to be threatened. The Emperor&#x27;s concern was that his already battered army might be forced to fight against superior forces again, so he ordered that the retreat be carried out at great speed. Had the coalition managed to advance with more vigour in the days following the Battle of Leipzig, the already disorganised French army would probably have been destroyed, but the coalition armies themselves had suffered such high losses at Leipzig that they were in no position to launch an effective pursuit. With military action confined to secondary rearguard actions, Napoleon was able to install his headquarters at Erfurt on 23 October and began to reorganise his forces. On 26 October, he sent orders to the various corps, directing them to Frankfurt via Eisenach and Fulda. Their assigned destination was the city of Mainz, by the Rhine river.

The coalition was buoyed by the news that Bavaria, a former French ally, agreed to join the Sixth Coalition according to the Treaty of Ried concluded just before the Battle of Leipzig. This allowed the coalition to threaten the overall military position of the French by moving a 45,000 - 50,000 Austro-Bavarian army, under the command of Karl Philipp von Wrede, into Napoleon&#x27;s rear, occupying Würzburg in Franconia. The small French garrison of Würzburg did not try to resist and instead barricaded themselves at the local citadel, allowing the enemy to occupy the town without a fight. From Würzburg, Wrede moved towards the strategic city of Hanau, along one of Napoleon&#x27;s main retreat routes. Wrede’s advance guard reached Hanau on 28 October and took possession of the city, blocking Napoleon’s route to Frankfurt. Although Wrede probably assumed that the main part of the French forces was retreating along a more northerly road to Coblenz and thus expected to face a force of only 20,000 men, he did entertain hopes that he would be able to play a major role in the defeat of Napoleon. He also believed that the French army was completely disorganised, which was not true, and was closely followed by the main coalition army, the &quot;Army of Bohemia&quot;, which was in reality much further away and not really in close contact with Napoleon&#x27;s forces.

==Order of battle==

===Coalition Army===
The Austrian and Bavarian army at the battle of Hanau comprised two army corps, one Austrian and one Bavarian, and numbered no less than 42,000 men: 33,000 infantrymen, 9,000 cavalrymen and 94 artillery pieces. They were under the overall command of Bavarian General Karl Philipp von Wrede.

The Austrian Corps, under the command of Field-Marshal-Lieutenant Baron Fresnet, numbered 24,000 men: 18,000 infantrymen (18 battalions), 6,000 cavalrymen (32 squadrons) and 34 artillery pieces. These men were organised in three divisions: the 1st division under General Bach, the 2nd division under General Trautenberg, and the 3rd division under General Spleny (cavalry and reserve artillery). The Bavarian Corps, under Wrede&#x27;s direct command, numbered 18,000 men: 15,000 infantrymen (17 battalions), 3,000 cavalrymen (20 squadrons), and 60 artillery pieces. These men were organised in two divisions, one cavalry reserve and one artillery reserve: the 2nd division was under General Beckers, the 3rd division under General Lamotte, the three-brigade cavalry reserve was under Generals Bieregg, Ellbracht, Dietz, and the artillery reserve was under General Cologne.

===French Army===
The French had suffered horrendous casualties at the battle of Leipzig, which left the French Corps at a fraction of its prior strength. Emperor Napoleon I was in personal command of the French forces in the battle. They numbered between 40,000 and 50,000 men, but only a fraction of them were ready for combat, with Napoleon able to count on little more than 30,000 men: the II, V and XI Army Corps, the I and II Cavalry Reserve Corps and the Imperial Guard. Guard units aside, many of the French battalions at Hanau were only 100-man strong, and the cavalry squadrons were much smaller.

Of these men, only one division (General Jean-Louis Dubreton&#x27;s, 15 battalions) of Marshal Claude Victor-Perrin&#x27;s II Corps, and another (General Henri-François-Marie Charpentier&#x27;s 11 battalions) of Marshal MacDonald XI Corps, were committed to battle with a grand total of some 7,000-8,000 men. Cavalry support came from Sébastiani&#x27;s II Cavalry Corps, some 3,000 sabres, and Nansouty&#x27;s Imperial Guard cavalry, some 4,000 sabres. The entirety of the Imperial Guard infantry and artillery, some 6,000 men and 52 cannons, were also committed. Napoleon thus commanded a total of about 20,000 men (40 battalions, 113 squadrons) at the battle of Hanau.

==Preliminaries==
On 29 October, having correctly reckoned that his force was strong enough to block the retreat of a disorganised enemy army, Wrede decided to give battle. He had plenty of time to prepare his dispositions and deployed his army in a relatively narrow and deep order, which was quite sensible, given that his intention was to remain on the defensive. Wrede&#x27;s left covered the road to Frankfurt and Mainz, the main retreat route that the French wanted to take. The bulk of his force was positioned along the Kinzig river, on the opposite bank from the city of Hanau, while on his right the divisions of Elbracht and Trautenberg were positioned on the southern bank of the Kinzig. Beckers&#x27;s Bavarian division constituted the far right and was deployed on either side of the Kinzig. One regiment, the Austrian &quot;Szekler&quot;, two battalions strong, as well as a great many skirmishers detached from their parent units were placed in an advanced position in the Lamboy forest. Most of the cavalry was placed in the second line, in the centre, with the artillery quite evenly dispersed throughout the battlefield.

Meanwhile, Napoleon spent the night of 29/30 October at Isenburg castle, near Gelnhausen, and received detailed intelligence about the Austro-Bavarian preparations, which confirmed that the enemy was intending to make a stand. Napoleon thus directed the army&#x27;s baggage and supply train northwards, away from the coalition forces, under the protection of Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova&#x27;s Cavalry Corps, while leading his remaining forces in a frontal manoeuvre against Wrede&#x27;s force. He ordered Victor to form the left wing with his Army Corps and march along the Kinzig, while MacDonald&#x27;s Corps and the Guard were to penetrate the Lamboi forest. Part of the Guard cavalry under General Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes was detached further north to cover the flank of the army. Napoleon studied Wrede&#x27;s position and spotted its main weakness, namely that he had most of his army deployed with the river behind it, which would act as a natural barrier should retreat be necessary. Upon seeing Wrede&#x27;s dispositions, Napoleon sarcastically noted: &quot;I have made Wrede a Count but it was beyond my power to make him a General.&quot; However, in order to exploit this potentially fatal weakness in Wrede&#x27;s deployment, Napoleon first had to beat him, and do so with an inferior number of infantry, less cavalry and fewer cannons, fighting against an enemy who had all the time it needed to deploy its forces for defense.

==Battle==
Wrede, following successful skirmishing against the French, began to deploy his forces to face the main French force of 20,000. On 30 October Wrede placed his centre with the River Kinzig behind it, and his right wing to its south in an isolated position with only a single bridge linking it with the main force. Napoleon had only 17,000 troops including Marshal MacDonald’s infantry and General Sébastiani’s cavalry to face the enemy forces blocking them. Due to dense forests on the east of Wrede’s positions the French were able to advance and make close contact with the allies almost unseen. Napoleon decided to attack the allies&#x27; left with all available troops. By midday Marshal Victor and MacDonald had cleared the forest in front of the allies&#x27; centre. Soon after, General Drouot found a track in the forest towards Wrede’s left on which cannon could be moved. Three hours later Grenadiers of the Old Guard had cleared the area of allied troops and Drouot began to deploy 50 cannons supported by cavalry of the Guard and Sébastiani. A brief artillery bombardment from Drouot’s cannons silenced Wrede’s 28 cannons. French cavalry then attacked and pushed back Wrede’s cavalry on his left flank, then attacked the flank of Wrede’s centre. Wrede’s centre started to fall back, skirting the banks of the Kinzig River and suffering heavy casualties. On the right wing, Wrede’s forces tried to cross the single bridge over the Kinzig River to reinforce the centre, but many drowned in the attempt. Wrede was successful in rallying his troops to form a defensive line running from Lamboy Bridge to the town of Hanau. During the night the allies abandoned Hanau. The French occupied Hanau on 31 October with little resistance. Napoleon made no effort to pursue Wrede, the main road to Frankfurt was now reopened, the French retreat continued.

==Aftermath==
Wrede suffered 9,000 casualties, Napoleon suffered fewer, but some 10,000 French stragglers became allied prisoners of war between 28 and 31 October. The French reached Frankfurt on 2 November 1813 and were only 20 miles from their relatively safe rear base at Mainz allowing Napoleon’s army to recover and face the subsequent invasion of France in 1814.

Napoleon was not slowed, blocked or interfered with on his march to Frankfurt, where he arrived in the afternoon of 31 October 1813. Militarily the battle was a costly victory for Napoleon. Wrede failed to block Napoleon&#x27;s path, although the allied forces of Russians, Prussians and Austrians had cut Napoleon&#x27;s line of retreat. However Napoleon evaded the maneuver. The Kingdom of Bavaria wanted with this battle to support militarily its shift to the allied side. It did not really matter to the Bavarian politicians and military whether the battle was won or lost—as long as it took place. On 5 November 1813 Alexander I marched with his troops into Frankfurt.

Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 7, was premiered in Vienna on 8 December 1813, with Beethoven himself conducting at a charity concert for soldiers wounded in the Battle of Hanau.

==Honors==
The best officers in the battle were honored by promotion and received many medals. For example, Carl Philipp von Wrede received two medals from the Austrian Empire: the Order of Leopold and the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa and two from the Russian Empire: the Order of Alexander Nevsky and the Order of St. George.

To commemorate the Battle of Hanau, memorials were erected in the city of Hanau, five of which have been preserved: at Lamboystrasse, Karl-Marx-Strasse and Robert Blum Strasse, and two more at the Kinzig bridge. The battle is also engraved at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris in the list of battles won by Napoleon.
In 2015, around 200 remains of French soldiers fallen in the battle were exhumed at the battle&#x27;s site.

<doc id="1220007" wikidata="Q159038" url="?curid=1220007" title="Spartina">
<text>Spartina is a genus of plants in the grass family, frequently found in coastal salt marshes. Species in this genus are commonly known as cordgrass or cord-grass, and are native to the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean in western and southern Europe, north-western and southern Africa, the Americas and the islands of the southern Atlantic Ocean; one or two species also occur on the western coast of North America and in freshwater habitats inland in the Americas. The highest species diversity is on the east coasts of North and South America, particularly Florida. They form large, often dense colonies, particularly on coastal salt marshes, and grow quickly. The species vary in size from 0.3–2 m tall. Many of the species will produce hybrids if they come into contact.

==Taxonomy==
In 2014, the taxon &quot;Spartina&quot; was subsumed into the genus &quot;Sporobolus&quot; and reassigned to the taxonomic status of section, but it may still be possible to see &quot;Spartina&quot; referred to as an accepted genus. In 2019, an interdisciplinary team of experts from all continents (except for Antarctica) coauthored a report published in the journal &quot;Ecology&quot; supporting &quot;Spartina&quot; as a genus.

The section name &quot;Spartina&quot; is derived from (), the Greek word for a cord made from Spanish broom (&quot;Spartium junceum&quot;).

===Species===
The following species are recognised in the section &quot;Spartina&quot;:
;Subsection &quot;Alterniflori&quot; 
* &quot;Sporobolus alterniflorus&quot; – smooth cordgrass – Atlantic coasts of North and South America, West Indies
* &quot;Sporobolus anglicus&quot; - Great Britain, introduced to Europe, China, Australia, New Zealand, and North America
* &quot;Sporobolus foliosus&quot; – California cordgrass – California, Baja California, Baja California Sur
* &quot;Sporobolus longispicus&quot; – Argentina, Uruguay
* &quot;Sporobolus maritimus&quot; - Europe, Africa
* &quot;Sporobolus × townsendii&quot; – Townsend&#x27;s cordgrass – western Europe
;Subsection &quot;Ponceletia&quot; 
* &quot;Sporobolus arundinacea&quot; – Tristan da Cunha, Amsterdam Island in Indian Ocean
* &quot;Sporobolus mobberleyanus&quot; P.M.Peterson &amp; Saarela – Tristan da Cunha, Amsterdam Island in Indian Ocean
* &quot;Sporobolus spartinae&quot; – Gulf cordgrass – Atlantic coast of North America from Florida to Argentina, incl the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico
;Subsection &quot;Spartina&quot; 
* &quot;Sporobolus bakeri&quot; – sand cordgrass – south-eastern US
* &quot;Sporobolus coarctatus&quot; – Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay
* &quot;Sporobolus cynosuroides&quot; – big cordgrass – eastern US (TX to MA); Bahamas
* &quot;Sporobolus × eatonianus&quot; – eastern North America
* &quot;Sporobolus hookerianus&quot; – alkali cordgrass – western Canada, western + central US, Chihuahua, Jalisco, Michoacán
* &quot;Sporobolus michauxianus&quot; – prairie cordgrass – from Northwest Territories to Texas and Newfoundland
* &quot;Sporobolus montevidensis&quot; – denseflower cordgrass – Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile
* &quot;Sporobolus pumilus&quot; – saltmeadow cordgrass – east coast of North America from Labrador to Tamaulipas; West Indies
* &quot;Sporobolus versicolor&quot; – Mediterranean, Azores

==Ecology==
Species of the section &quot;Spartina&quot; are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Aaron&#x27;s skipper, which feeds exclusively on smooth cordgrass, and the engrailed moth.

Some species of the section &quot;Spartina&quot; are considered as ecosystem engineers that can strongly influence the physical and biological environment. This is particularly important in areas where invasive &quot;Spartina&quot; species significantly alter their new environment, with impacts to native plants and animals.

===As an invasive species===
Three of the &quot;Spartina&quot; species have become invasive plants in some countries. In British Columbia, &quot;Sporobolus anglica&quot;, also known as English cordgrass, is an aggressive, aquatic alien that invades mud flats, salt marshes and beaches, out-competing native plants, spreading quickly over mud flats and leaving large &quot;Spartina&quot; meadows. It is also invasive in China and California.

&quot;Sporobolus montevidensis&quot; and &quot;Sporobolus pumilus&quot; have become invasive on the Iberian Peninsula and the west coast of the United States

&quot;Sporobolus alterniflorus&quot; and its hybrids with other &quot;Spartina&quot; species are invasive in numerous locations around the globe, including China, California, England, France, and Spain.

==Cultivation==
Species of the section &quot;Spartina&quot; have been planted to reclaim estuarine areas for farming, to supply fodder for livestock, and to prevent erosion. Various members of the genus (especially &quot;Sporobolus alterniflorus&quot; and its derivatives, &quot;Sporobolus anglicus&quot; and &quot;Sporobolus × townsendii&quot;) have spread outside of their native boundaries and become invasive.

Big cordgrass (&quot;S. cynosuroides&quot;) is used in the construction of bull&#x27;s eye targets for sports archery. A properly constructed target can stop an arrow safely without damage to the arrowhead as it lodges in the target.

<doc id="1220014" wikidata="Q271854" url="?curid=1220014" title="Yoko Shimada">
<text>was a Japanese actress, best known to Western audiences for her portrayal of Mariko in the 1980 miniseries &quot;Shōgun&quot;.

==&quot;Shogun&quot; miniseries==
Shimada was the only female member of &quot;Shōgun&quot;″s massive cast of Japanese actors shown speaking English, for which she relied on a dialogue coach, as she was not fluent in the language at the time. Her English improved greatly during the production, however, allowing her to work in a few English language films during the 1980s and 1990s. In 1981, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for her work on &quot;Shōgun&quot;. While the nine-hour long &quot;Shōgun&quot; was a critical success in the U.S., it flopped in Japan when it was released as a severely truncated theatrical version.

==Personal life==
In 1988, Shimada had an affair with singer Yuya Uchida, who was married at the time. She reportedly had resorted to alcoholism and appeared in a nude photo book in 1992 in an attempt to clear her personal debts. Though the book was a bestseller, it damaged her reputation as an actress. In 2011, at the age of 58, she starred in an adult video.

Shimada died at a hospital in Tokyo on 25 July 2022, due to complications from colorectal cancer.

<doc id="1220021" wikidata="Q5344429" url="?curid=1220021" title="Noel Mellish">
<text>Edward Noel Mellish (24 December 1880 – 8 July 1962) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first Padre to receive the award.

==Background and family==
Edward Noel Mellish was born on 24 December 1880 at Oakleigh Park, Barnet, North London. He was the son of Edward and Mary Mellish. He went on to be educated at Saffron Walden Grammar School and from there became a member of the Artists Rifles. In 1900 he began serving with Baden-Powell&#x27;s Police during the Second Boer War in South Africa.

He returned to study Theology at King&#x27;s College London and took holy orders in 1912.

On December 3, 1918 he married Elizabeth Wallace Molesworth (b.1894), great-great-great granddaughter of the Hon. Major Edward Molesworth, son of Robert Molesworth, 1st Viscount Molesworth.

==World War I==
On the outbreak of the First World War Mellish was assistant curate at St Paul&#x27;s, Deptford. He offered his services to the chaplaincy and served from May 1915 until February 1919. Just a few months after the start of his service, his brother Second Lieutenant Richard Coppin Mellish was killed in action whilst serving with the 1st Middlesex Regiment at the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. Reverend Mellish was attached to the 4th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers in Ypres Salient in 1916 and it was then during the first three days of the Actions of St Eloi Craters, 27 to 29 March 1916, that he performed the actions for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He was the first member of the army chaplaincy to win the VC in the First World War.

===Victoria Cross===
Mellish was 35 years old, and a chaplain in the Army Chaplains&#x27; Department, British Army during the First World War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC. He received his VC from King George V in an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 12 June 1916.

The citation reads:
:&quot;For most conspicuous bravery. During heavy fighting on three consecutive days he repeatedly went backwards and forwards, under continuous and heavy shell and machine-gun fire, between our original trenches and those captured from the enemy, in order to tend and rescue wounded men. He brought in ten badly wounded men on the first day from ground swept by machine-gun fire, and three were actually killed while he was dressing their wounds.

:The battalion to which he was attached was relieved on the second day, but he went back and brought in twelve more wounded men.

:On the night of the third day he took charge of a party of volunteers and once more returned to the trenches to rescue the remaining wounded.

:This splendid work was quite voluntary on his part and outside the scope of his ordinary duties.&quot;

Sint-Elooi (St Eloi) is located approximately about south of Ypres, Belgium. The defence of St Eloi is commemorated by the Hill 62 Memorial.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Fusilier Museum in the Tower of London. Replica medals are on display at the Museum of Army Chaplaincy.

===After the war===
Meelish was awarded the Military Cross in 1919.

After the war Mellish was vicar of St Mark&#x27;s, Lewisham and later of Wangford-cum-Henham and Reydon in Suffolk. He was vicar of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Great Dunmow in Essex from 1928 to 1948 and then was licensed as the perpetual curate of the Church of St Dunstan, Baltonsborough in Somerset.

He served in the Second World War as an air-raid precautions warden. In 1946 he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of the county of Essex.

==Memorial==
Mellish&#x27;s birthplace, Trenabie House, in Oakleigh Park North, no longer exists but in March 2016 a plaque was installed nearby in a ceremony attended by Mellish&#x27;s daughter Claire.

<text>Joseph Spence (August 3, 1910 – March 18, 1984) was a Bahamian guitarist and singer. He is well known for his vocalizations and humming while playing the guitar. Several American musicians, including Taj Mahal, the Grateful Dead, Ry Cooder, Catfish Keith, Woody Mann, and Olu Dara, as well as the British guitarist John Renbourn, were influenced by and have recorded variations of his arrangements of gospel and Bahamian songs.

==Biography==
Born in Andros, Bahamas, in 1910, Spence was the son of a pastor. He got his start in music as a teenager playing in his great-uncle Tony Spence&#x27;s band. After leaving school he worked as a sponge fisher, stonemason, and carpenter, and as a crop cutter in the United States.

The earliest recordings of Spence were made on his porch by the folk musicologist Samuel Charters, in 1958. Charters initially thought that Spence&#x27;s guitar playing was the work of two players duelling. These recordings were released by Folkways Records on the album &quot;Music of the Bahamas Volume One&quot;, in 1959.

In 1964, Fritz Richmond travelled to the Bahamas to record Spence, and recordings made in Spence&#x27;s living room were issued on the album &quot;Happy All the Time&quot;. The following year, Jody Stecher and Peter Siegel made the trip to record Spence, recording tracks also featuring his sister Edith and her husband Raymond Pinder and their daughter Geneva, which were released on &quot;The Real Bahamas Volume One&quot;. These tracks included Spence&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;I Bid You Goodnight&quot;, which was covered by the Grateful Dead
and Ralph McTell, among others. The album was a success, and as a result Spence toured the United States. A second volume was released in 1978.

Mike Heron, of the Incredible String Band, credited Spence as the inspiration for the &quot;Lay down, dear sister&quot; passage in &quot;A Very Cellular Song&quot; on the album &quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter&quot;, released in 1968. Curiously, Spence credited Heron with the same song, claiming to have learned it from the Incredible String Band.

Spence released a third album, &quot;Good Morning Mr. Walker&quot;, in 1972. He performed several more times in the United States during the 1970s.

He died on March 18, 1984, aged 73, in Nassau, Bahamas.

==Musical style==
Spence&#x27;s repertoire encompassed calypso, blues, folk music and sacred songs. He played a steel-string acoustic guitar, and nearly all of his recorded songs employ guitar accompaniment in a drop D tuning. The power of his playing derives from moving bass lines and interior voices and a driving beat that he emphasized with foot tapping. To this mix he added blues coloration and calypso rhythms to achieve a unique and easily identifiable sound. He has been called the folk guitarist&#x27;s Thelonious Monk.

==Legacy==
Spence&#x27;s playing inspired the likes of Ry Cooder, Taj Mahal and Jody Stecher.

Several tributes to Spence have been recorded. After his death in 1984 the Richard Thompson fan club produced a benefit tribute album to Spence and the Pinder Family, &quot;Out on the Rolling Sea&quot;, released on the Green Linnet label and featuring Henry Kaiser, Taj Mahal, and Martin Carthy.

Bahamian musicians KB and Fred Ferguson paid tribute in the song &quot;Riddim and Rhyme&quot;. In 1990 Rounder Records released the album &quot;Glory&quot;, consisting of recordings made of religious music by Guy Droussart. 

Spence&#x27;s recording of &quot;That Glad Reunion Day&quot; was used in the 2004 film &quot;Open Water&quot; and also appears on its soundtrack album.

Spence&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot; from the 1980 Rounder release &quot;Living on the Hallelujah Side&quot; has endured as a unique holiday cover. Writing in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, music critic Peter Margasak describes how Spence &quot;obviously forgot or never knew the song&#x27;s lyrics, so he crudely spits out a load of gibberish, in perfect time&quot;, describing it as &quot;a performance for the ages&quot;. It was included in Dr. Demento&#x27;s festive collection, &quot;Holidays in Dementia&quot;. The song was patronized for several years during the holiday season on the Boers and Bernstein show on Chicago&#x27;s WSCR 670 &quot;The Score&quot; sports radio station. The crew joked that Spence&#x27;s low voice and distinctive mumbling reminded them of host Terry Boers - the &quot;Boers&quot; half of B&amp;B.

<text>George Imlach McIntosh VC (24 April 1897 – 20 June 1968) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 20 years old, and a private in the 1/6th Battalion, The Gordon Highlanders, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place at the Battle of Passchendaele for which he was awarded the VC.

On 31 July 1917 at Ypres, Belgium, during the consolidation of a position, the company came under machine-gun fire at close range and Private Mclntosh immediately rushed forward under heavy fire and reaching the emplacement, threw a Mills grenade into it, killing two of the enemy and wounding a third. Subsequently, entering the dug-out he found two light machine-guns which he carried back with him. His quick grasp of the situation and the rapidity with which he acted undoubtedly saved many of his comrades and enabled the consolidation to proceed unhindered by machine-gun fire.

George McIntosh was born in Buckie, Banffshire. McIntosh went on to join the Royal Air Force and served in World War II, and during 1942 was the senior NCO with No 1 squadron. He later achieved the rank of Flight Sergeant.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Gordon Highlanders Museum, Aberdeen, Scotland.

==Freemasonry==
McIntosh was a Scottish Freemason being Initiated in Lodge Gordon, No. 589, (Buckie, Banffshire, Scotland) on 7 April 1920, Passed on 10 March and Raised on 6 April 1921.

<text>Susan Milan ( ; born 3 September 1947) is an English professor of flute of the Royal College of Music, classical performer, recording artiste, composer, author and entrepreneur.

==Biography==

Susan Milan was born in London, the daughter of civil servants. Between 1958 and 1963, she became a Junior Exhibitioner at the Royal College of Music. During 1960 to 1966, she was a member of the London Schools Symphony Orchestra. From 1963 to 1967, she was a scholar of the Royal College of Music, graduating with honours, where she became a professor of Flute in 1984. From 1966 to 1972, she attended Marcel Moyse master classes in Boswil.

In 1967, she was awarded a Countess of Munster Scholarship to study as a Post Graduate under Geoffrey Gilbert at the Guildhall School of Music. After graduation in 1968, she was invited to become Principal Flute of the Bournemouth Sinfonietta. In 1974, she made musical history by being appointed the first woman principal and member of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra where she remained for eight years. Since then she has sustained a multi-dimensional career as an orchestral guest principal, chamber musician, soloist, recording artiste, composer, author, teacher, lecturer and entrepreneur.

In 2001, she was appointed Artistic Director of Woodwind for the Evergreen Orchestra, Taiwan. In 2007, she was appointed Adjunct Professor of Music at Henan University, China, and founded the British Isles Music Festival in Charterhouse School for outstanding young musicians.

==Activities==

In 1979, Milan released her first solo recording on the ASV label. This was followed in 1981 by a second solo recording on the Hyperion label, and contracts with Chandos (1990) and Upbeat (1990). 1997 saw the issue of the Master Classics Archive Series of historic flute recordings featuring Milan. Described as the &quot;Queen of the Flute&quot; by journalist Huang Hua, Milan has recorded concertos, duos and chamber music recitals for the Hyperion, Da Capo, Omega, Cala, Metier and ASV labels. She has further recorded more than a dozen recordings of concertos and recitals for the &quot;Chandos&quot; label including three collections of French repertoire. She has also made recital recordings of French Impressionist composers (Saint-Saëns, Debussy, Lili Boulanger, Ibert, Dutilleux, Poulenc and Feld) for Upbeat Records and Master Classics.

Her most recent recording of contemporary British works for flute and piano, with the pianist Andrew Ball, was released on the Metier label in 2008. She has also recorded the Schmidt Concerto by Ole Schmidt with Schmidt conducting, for the Da Capo label. In 2010, she began recording the Simpson Concerto for Hyperion.

Recent commissions have included a concerto from the American composer Keith Gates, &quot;Oiseau Soleil&quot; for flute and piano by the French composer Jean Sichler, &quot;The Moon Dances&quot; by the British composer Cecilia McDowall, &quot;Sonata&quot; by British composer Brian Lock and &quot;Octagon&quot; by British composer Ian Finney. Her accompanist, pianist Ian Brown has worked with Schering, Rostropovich, Galway and other famous classical musicians.

In her a career as an orchestral guest principal, chamber musician, soloist, teacher and lecturer, she has often featured on the BBC. She has given numerous UK and world premieres, touring frequently throughout Europe, US, Australia and the Far East.

Milan performs repertoire from the Baroque, classical, romantic, impressionist, and contemporary periods. As well as a wide repertoire of recital and chamber music, she performs solo works by J. S. Bach, Hofmann, Khatchaturian, Mozart, Saint-Saëns and Vivaldi, with orchestra, as well as works by C. P. E. Bach, Carl Nielsen, Ibert, Jolivet, Reinecke, Stamitz and Telemann.

==Ensembles==

In the chamber music field, she formed The London Chamber Music Group (featuring flute, oboe, violin, viola, cello, piano and harp). With members of the group, she recorded the chamber music of Eugene Goossens for the Chandos label. She has also performed with The Debussy Ensemble, Weber Ensemble and Milan-Ball Duo. Susan formed the Milan Trio, with her second son, cellist Christopher Jepson, and the pianist Andrew Ball, and performs with the Instrumental Quintet of London, for flute, string trio and harp, with Nicholas ward, Matthew Jones, Sebastian Somberti and Ieuan Jones.

==Accomplishments== 

In 1992, Milan researched and published 19th century repertoire for Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Several technical books followed including two technical scale books in 2000, and a handbook of programme notes, for flute performers in 2006. She is presently restoring a collection of historic [78&quot;] recordings of flautists from 1910 to 1945, to be issued on the Master Classics label.

In 1960, she was presented with the Royal College of Music&#x27;s Evekisch Prize by Sir Malcolm Sargent. In recognition of her achievements, she was elected President of the British Flute Society in 1990 until 1995. She was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal College in November 1999 which was presented to her by HRH Prince Charles.

<text>Major Samuel Hill Lawrence VC (22 January 1831 – 17 June 1868), born in Cork, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Family==
His father, also called Samuel Hill, had a military career in the 32nd Regiment of Foot and was wounded at Quatre Bras, the prelude to Waterloo. The Lawrence family formed part of the &#x27;Protestant Ascendancy&#x27; in Ireland. Lawrence Snr. may have been master of the Orange Lodge at Nenagh around the year 1825 and is recorded as living at Belmont Cottage, Douglas, near Cork, Ireland in 1837. His mother, Margaret Macdonald, was of Scots origin. He was the cousin of Lieutenant Thomas Cadell VC.

==Details==
He was 26 years old, and a lieutenant, with a recent field promotion to captain, in the 32nd Regiment of Foot (later The Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deeds took place on 7 July 1857 and 26 September 1857 at the Siege of Lucknow for which he was awarded the VC.

He was recommended, by the board of officers which considered the claims of almost all those members of the 32nd Foot for Lucknow-related VCs, for a VC with bar. This suggestion was not taken up in later stages of the process. According to the fourth &#x27;clause&#x27; of the original warrant creating the V.C., he would only have been eligible for a bar if he had already been decorated before the second V.C. action.

==Further information==
He later joined the 25th Regiment of Foot, 8th Hussars and ended his military career, in 1865, with the rank of major in the 11th Hussars.

The United Services Gazette of 15 August 1868 (p8) reported that &#x27;Major Samuel Hill Lawrence V.C., late of the 11th Hussars, died on 17 June at Estancia del Arazati (sic) Monte Video (sic), South America aged 37.&#x27; (15)Uruguay 17 June 1868. In fact, Arazatí is in the &#x27;departamento&#x27; (&#x27;province&#x27;) of San Jose, not Montevideo. Research at both Montevideo, including the British Cemetery which is often quoted as his burial place, and Arazatí has, so far, failed to reveal his final resting place.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry Museum, Bodmin, Cornwall. Lawrence&#x27;s campaign medals and miniatures are also on display at the museum. They were donated by a member of the Richards family, into which Lawrence&#x27;s only surviving sister had married.

<text>The Treaty of Poznań (or Treaty of Posen) was signed on 11 December 1806 in Poznań and ended the war between the French Empire and the Electorate of Saxony. The latter was an ally of Prussia as a member of the Fourth Coalition against France. It was defeated in the battles of Jena and Auerstedt and partially occupied by French troops. The peace treaty was negotiated, for the French, by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand. According to its terms, the electorate became the Kingdom of Saxony and annexed certain territories (including Cottbus) taken from Prussia. It was required to join the Confederation of the Rhine and pay France an indemnity of 25 million francs. It had to contribute a small contingent for the ongoing French campaign against the coalition and place 20,000 troops at French disposal in any future war. Saxony had to ceded a small amount of territory in its west to the new Kingdom of Westphalia.

<text>Richard George Masters VC (30 March 1877 – 4 April 1963) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 41 years old, and a Private in the Royal Army Service Corps, British Army, attd. 141st Field Ambulance during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 9 April 1918 near Bethune, France, owing to an enemy attack, communications were cut off and the wounded could not be evacuated. The road was reported impassable but Private Masters volunteered to try to get through and after great difficulty succeeded, although he had to clear the road of all sorts of debris. He made journey after journey throughout the afternoon over a road which was being shelled and swept by machine-gun fire and once he was bombed by an aeroplane. The greater number of wounded (approximately 200 men) were evacuated by him as his was the only car which got through.

After his death in 1963 at the age of 86, he was buried at St Cuthbert&#x27;s parish church in Churchtown, Southport.

The Territorial Army and Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) Centre 30 Pelham Drive, Bootle, Liverpool is named after Private Masters, VC. It was built to house what is now 238 SQN 156 TPT RLC(V) – 238 Squadron of 156 Transport Regiment Royal Logistic Corps (Volunteers). The RLC, formerly the Royal Corps of Transport/RCT, includes the Field Ambulance units which trace their history back through the Royal Army Service Corps, the Army Service Corps and beyond.
A troop of 96 Sqn RLC based at ATR Pirbright is also named after him.

In 1972, when the Royal Air Force&#x27;s trials vessel &quot;No.5012&quot; and former mineweeper HMS &quot;Halsham&quot;, was transferred to the Royal Corps of Transport to continue operations for Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, it was renamed &quot;Richard George Masters&quot; (later shortened to &quot;R G Masters&quot;), until withdrawn from service in 1979.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the New Royal Logistic Corps Museum &quot; RHQ The RLC, Building 204, Worthy Down Barracks, Winchester. SO21 2RG England)&quot;. 2021 (signed KMB)

<doc id="1220033" wikidata="Q2139899" url="?curid=1220033" title="Darts of Pleasure">
<text>&quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; is a song by Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand, released as the band&#x27;s debut single in the United Kingdom on 8 September 2003 through Domino Records. In the United States, it was issued as an extended play (EP). The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 44 on 15 September 2003, where it stayed for one week.

==History and content==
Franz Ferdinand had first formed in 2001 consisting of Alex Kapranos, Bob Hardy, Nick McCarthy and Paul Thomson. While the band had originally planned to release the songs themselves, their underground success in the UK lead them to sign with Domino Records in 2003, who would eventually release the EP.

The band developed its reputation by supporting Hot Hot Heat and Interpol. &quot;NME&quot; editor Connor McNicholas said, &quot;My first contact with Franz Ferdinand was when someone was playing the &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; demos, in the NME office, and it was genuinely one of those moments when a track goes on and I come bundling out of my office saying &#x27;what the hell is this because this is amazing&#x27;&quot;. It was therefore no surprise the band won the &quot;Phillip Hall Radar Award&quot; at the NME Awards of 2004 (announced in late 2003). Furthermore, NME described the band as &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot; and featured the band on the front cover describing them as &quot;The Band That Will Change Your Life&quot;.

Alex Kapranos explained to &quot;Q&quot; magazine that &quot;the song is about seduction and the &#x27;Darts of Pleasure&#x27; that hit you are actually words.&quot;

The song ends with several lyrics in German, most famously the line &quot;&quot;Ich heiße Super Fantastisch&quot;!&quot; (&quot;My name is Super-Fantastic!&quot;, whereas &quot;Super-Fantastic&quot; is the name, not an adjective. Although variations in the German language occur, making the true meaning &quot;I am called Super-Fantastic!&quot;).

==Release and reception==
&quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; was released on 8 September 2003. The single was received well with Pitchfork Media giving it a rating of 8.3, calling the single a &quot;bombastically truncated nod to all things indie/electro/new wave. Strikingly Interpolian as they lunge in alongside a healthy drum clip, jagged guitar, and a hardboiled bassline Alex Kapranos&#x27; morose-chic vocals are coy but cool.&quot; Jon Myer of 6 Music also praised the track, calling it &quot;a great radio record and a great debut.&quot;

==Track listings==
Lead vocals are performed by Alex Kapranos except on &quot;Van Tango&quot; and &quot;Tell Her Tonight&quot;, performed by Nick McCarthy.

<doc id="1220034" wikidata="Q7645101" url="?curid=1220034" title="Supreme Team (gang)">
<text>The Supreme Team was an organized crime syndicate that operated throughout the 1980s in New York City. Their headquarters was the Baisley Park Projects, in South Jamaica, Queens, New York City, New York. The leaders were Kenneth &quot;Supreme&quot; McGriff and his nephew, Gerald &quot;Prince&quot; Miller. In 1989, McGriff began serving a 10 year sentence in federal prison for a narcotics conviction.

In February 2007, McGriff was convicted in federal court of racketeering, two murder-for-hire homicides, narcotics trafficking, and engaging in illegal financial transactions with drug money. Although facing the death penalty for this conviction, he was ultimately sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

==Federal case against the Supreme Team==
On August 16, 1996, in a case against members of the &quot;Supreme Team&quot; their operation and a number of alleged crimes were documented in the case file.

==Gang structure and operations==

The Supreme Team was a street gang organized in the early 1980s in the vicinity of the Baisley Park Houses in Jamaica, Queens, New York, by a group of teenagers who were members of the Five-Percent Nation. Under the leadership of Kenneth &quot;Supreme&quot; McGriff, with Miller, his nephew, as second-in-command, the gang concentrated its criminal efforts on the widespread distribution of crack cocaine. At its 1987 peak, the Supreme Team&#x27;s receipts exceeded $200,000 a day, and the gang regularly committed acts of violence and murder to maintain its stranglehold on the area&#x27;s drug trade. After McGriff went to jail in 1987, leadership of the Supreme Team was assumed by Gerald &quot;Prince&quot; Miller. Miller solidified his control by increasing the security force and employing it against rivals and against Team members suspected of disloyalty. During 1987 alone, Miller and the then-incarcerated McGriff ordered at least eight homicides.

The Supreme Team&#x27;s narcotics operations used dozens of employees, including layers of drug sellers to insulate the gang leaders from the street-level activity. Team members communicated using the Five Percenter Supreme Alphabet and Supreme Mathematics as a coded language and numerical systems. To thwart law enforcement efforts further, Miller used armed bodyguards and deployed sentinels with two-way radios on rooftops. The sophistication of the gang&#x27;s operation enabled it to survive the periodic targeting of various members for prosecution by the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and the Queens County District Attorney&#x27;s Office (collectively, the &quot;State&quot;).

In late 1987, however, while Miller was incarcerated on state charges, a task force of NYPD and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents executed search warrants on a number of Supreme Team storage locations, drug outlets, and residences. Although the gang was tipped off about the raid shortly before it occurred and was able to remove 11 kilograms of cocaine and $200,000 from targeted premises, authorities nonetheless seized an array of weapons, narcotics trade hardware, photographs, documents, and instructional manuals on criminal conduct, as well as a kilogram of cocaine and thousands of dollars. Following that raid and his own arrest by federal agents, McGriff ordered that the gang&#x27;s operations be shut down.

When Miller was released from prison in the spring of 1989, he began to rebuild the Supreme Team and regained control of two of its most lucrative retail locations known as &quot;spots.&quot; The reorganized gang under Miller included Arroyo as the second-in-command, Hunt as Miller&#x27;s bodyguard, Ernesto Piniella as head of security, and Hale, Jimenez, and Julio Hernandez as security workers. Tucker and Coleman managed retail spots and supervised crews of workers; long-time gang member David Robinson helped supervise the drug operations and kept records. Raymond Robinson assisted in arranging cocaine purchases, provided security during drug transactions, supervised the processing of cocaine into crack, and delivered crack to sales locations. The Supreme Team began to reclaim its hold on the area drug trade and built its gross receipts up to $10,000 a day.

The substantive narcotics distribution charges against the present defendants focused on the period from December 1989 to March 1990, during which the State was monitoring the gang&#x27;s activity with wiretaps. During that period, the Supreme Team conducted its business in the Baisley Park apartment of David Robinson&#x27;s mother. Tucker, Coleman, and David Robinson would deliver to the apartment the moneys received at the retail spots they supervised; Miller and the Team&#x27;s primary drug courier Trent Morris would negotiate cocaine deals by telephone with William Graham, a supplier who had Colombian connections; and Morris and Raymond Robinson would then drive to Graham&#x27;s apartment with money to purchase kilogram-quantities of cocaine. The cocaine would be brought back to the Robinson apartment, where it was processed as crack, packaged, and given to Arroyo, David Robinson, Tucker, or Coleman, who in turn arranged for its sale by street-level employees.

The gang also resumed its use of violence and homicide. The government presented evidence at trial, not all of which resulted in convictions, of homicides committed both prior to the Supreme Team&#x27;s 1987 shut-down and after its 1989 renaissance.

===The Bolden and Page murders===
In 1987, the Supreme Team was allied with another drug gang, led by Lorenzo &quot;Fat Cat&quot; Nichols, who supplied the Supreme Team with powder cocaine. Nichols suspected two men, Henry and Isaac Bolden, of robbing Nichols&#x27;s organization. While Nichols was incarcerated, he sought Miller&#x27;s assistance in locating the Boldens so that Nichols&#x27;s crew members could kill them.

To obtain that information, Miller sought the help of two corrupt New York State Parole Division employees, Parole Officer Ina McGriff (no relation to Kenneth McGriff) and secretary Ronnie Younger. Ina McGriff was responsible for supervising the parole of Supreme Team security chief Ernesto Piniella but had become romantically involved with him; Younger had become romantically involved with Miller. The Team regularly paid both women for assistance. For example, McGriff falsely certified that Piniella was in compliance with parole requirements; she and Younger provided the gang leaders with information from their parole files, false identification documents, and information about the whereabouts of other parolees; and McGriff, who as a Parole Officer carried a gun, supplied Supreme Team members with ammunition.

Piniella and Ina McGriff testified that Miller paid the two women $3,000 for the addresses for the two Boldens and their families. Handwritten notes of such addresses were recovered in a raid of a Supreme Team apartment; the notes were written in part by Younger, according to a handwriting expert&#x27;s testimony, and in part by Ina McGriff, according to her own testimony. The notes provided Henry Bolden&#x27;s address in the Bronx, where he was later shot; and they provided Isaac Bolden&#x27;s mother&#x27;s address, in the immediate vicinity of which he was later shot and killed.

In 1987, Ina McGriff also gave Piniella copies of Parole Division documents indicating that Supreme Team member James Page was cooperating with authorities. Upon receiving that information, Kenneth McGriff, who had just been arrested on federal charges, ordered that Page be killed; Piniella subsequently arranged Page&#x27;s murder.

Gus Rivera was a Supreme Team member who had introduced the gang&#x27;s leaders to some of its Colombian suppliers. According to the trial testimony, four of these Colombian drug traffickers were robbed of their cocaine and brutally murdered in July 1989 by Miller, Arroyo, Hale, Hunt, and Jimenez. However, other than the testimony that two of these men were known as &quot;Fernando&quot; and &quot;George,&quot; the government was unable to present evidence as to their identities, and their bodies were never identified. The jury found that these murders, alleged as RICO predicate acts, were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

In the wake of these murders, the gang decided that Rivera was more of a liability than an asset. Accordingly, in August 1989, Arroyo arranged for Rivera to be killed. Rivera was shot in the head in a Baisley Park courtyard, but he survived and hid from the gang, temporarily. Arroyo learned Rivera&#x27;s whereabouts from Rivera&#x27;s girlfriend, Toni McGee (also a Supreme Team member) by threatening to kill her. Arroyo and Hale proceeded to track Rivera to a South Jamaica motel, where Rivera was murdered.

===The Suarez-Perlaza murders===
Fernando Suarez and Pablo Perlaza were also Colombian suppliers to the Supreme Team. In the summer of 1989, the Team decided to steal these suppliers&#x27; cocaine rather than buy it. Accordingly, in August 1989, when Suarez and Perlaza arrived at Hale&#x27;s Baisley Park apartment, they were held at gunpoint by Julio Hernandez and Jose &quot;Shorty&quot; Goncalves from New Jersey, while Arroyo and Hale bound them with tape. Supreme Team members then tied the suppliers&#x27; heads in plastic bags. While Suarez and Perlaza were suffocating, Hale beat their heads with a baseball bat. Hunt was then called upon to help dispose of the bodies. After he arrived, the bodies were loaded into a car and dumped in separate locations in Queens. Later, knowing that her husband had gone to meet Arroyo before disappearing, Suarez&#x27;s wife telephoned Arroyo, who told her that Suarez was supposed to have met him but never arrived.

==In media==
&quot;Supreme Team&quot;, a three-part documentary series about Kenneth &quot;Supreme&quot; McGriff and the Supreme Team, directed by Nas and Peter Scalettar, premiered in 2022 at the Tribeca Film Festival and on Showtime.

<doc id="1220036" wikidata="Q4710105" url="?curid=1220036" title="Albert Edward McKenzie">
<text>Albert Edward McKenzie VC (23 October 1898 – 3 November 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
McKenzie was a 19-year-old able seaman in the Royal Navy during the First World War who was taking part in the Zeebrugge Raid when he performed the deed for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22/23 April 1918 at Zeebrugge, Belgium, Able Seaman McKenzie was a member of a storming party on the night of the operation. He landed with his machine-gun in the face of great difficulties, advancing down the Mole with his commanding officer (Arthur Leyland Harrison) who with most of his party was killed. The seaman accounted for several of the enemy running for shelter to a destroyer alongside the Mole, and was severely wounded whilst working his gun in an exposed position.

He was presented with his VC by King George V at Buckingham Palace. However, having almost recovered from his wounds, he died of influenza during the world flu pandemic at the beginning of November 1918. He is buried in Camberwell Old Cemetery, South London.

==The medal==
Mckenzie&#x27;s Victoria Cross is still owned by the McKenzie family and is on loan to the Imperial War Museum in London.

==Commemoration==

A memorial in honour of Albert McKenzie VC was unveiled on 23 October 2015 (the 117th anniversary of his birth) at the junction of Tower Bridge Road, Decima Street and Bermondsey Street, Bermondsey, in the London Borough of Southwark.

<doc id="1220040" wikidata="Q2530679" url="?curid=1220040" title="Bishop Tuff">
<text>The Bishop Tuff is a welded tuff which formed 764,800 ± 600 years ago as a rhyolitic pyroclastic flow during the approximately six-day eruption that formed the Long Valley Caldera. Large outcrops of the tuff are located in Inyo and Mono Counties, California, United States. Approximately 200 cubic kilometers of ash and tuff erupted outside the caldera.

==Modern exposure==
The Bishop Tuff caps a volcanic plateau in the northern Owens Valley in eastern California. The tableland formation is located east of U.S. Route 395 and west of the Nevada stateline, sitting northwest of Bishop and southeast of Crowley Lake and Mammoth Lakes. Another part of the flow is south of Mono Lake, and surrounding the Mono-Inyo Craters.

Deposits of Bishop Tuff in this area cover nearly , and are as thick as .

The Owens River cuts through the Volcanic Tableland, an ignimbrite plateau which is a principal sector of the Bishop Tuff outflow sheet. Erosion of the plateau by the Owens River has carved the Owens River Gorge.

== Lithology ==
The Bishop Tuff is a high-silicate rhyolitic welded tuff, made up of ash and pumice clasts. The main minerals found in the pumice clasts are biotite, plagioclase, quartz, and sanidine. The main composition is SiO2 (73.4-77.9%), followed by Al2O3 (12.7%).

The Bishop Tuff is compositionally zoned. The lower section, formed from ash fall, is notated by pyroxene-free high-silica rhyolite pumice. The upper section, formed by pyroclastic flow, is notated by pyroxene-bearing high-silica rhyolite pumice. The magma that formed the Bishop Tuff is suggested to be a &quot;residual magma derived from some parental magma and not itself a primary or parental partial melt of common crustal rocks&quot;.

<text>John Molyneux VC (22 November 1890 – 25 March 1972) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
John Molyneux was born on 22 November 1890 to mother Minnie Jane and coal miner father, Joseph, who worked as a hewer at Sherdley Colliery. Young John, who was always known as Jack, was educated at Holy Trinity school in Parr. He left school at twelve to work in the mines.

==Details==
He was 26 years old, and a sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 9 October 1917 east of Langemarck, Belgium, during an attack which was held up by machine-gun fire and causing many casualties, Sergeant Molyneux organised a bombing party to clear the trench in front of a house. Many of the enemy were killed and a machine-gun captured. The sergeant then called for someone to follow him and rushed for the house. By the time the extra men arrived he was in the thick of a hand-to-hand fight which only lasted a short time and the enemy surrendered. In addition to the dead and wounded between 20 or 30 prisoners were taken.

He also won the Croix de Guerre (Belgium).

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Fusiliers Museum, Tower of London, England.

<text>Raymond Larabie (born 1970) is a Canadian designer of TrueType and OpenType computer fonts. He owns &quot;Typodermic Fonts&quot; type foundry, which distributes both commercially licensed and shareware/freeware fonts.

==Biography and career==

Larabie was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In his self-published autobiography, he states that he spent much of his childhood in the cottage country of the Ottawa Valley, an isolated environment that did not allow him to have traditional friendships or social activites, and thus spent much of his time learning computers and typography; he graduated from Sheridan College with a degree in classical animation, a field that was largely obsolete by the time he received his degree. Larabie was employed at Rockstar Canada and had contributed his designs to multiple video game titles, including the hit series&#x27; &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Max Payne&quot;, before he quit the company in 2002 to focus full-time on type design, after having released a series of freeware fonts over the Internet under the brand LarabieFonts since 1996. Larabie recalled an incident in which Rockstar had used his Pricedown font for the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; logo, completely unaware that its designer was their own employee. He moved to Nagoya, Japan in 2008, maintaining his Canadian citizenship and returning to the country briefly in 2017 to celebrate its sesquicentennial.

Larabie primarily specializes in novelty typefaces that are intended for use in desktop publishing and graphic design. The logo for &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, for instance, uses Larabie&#x27;s Pricedown font, which is based on the logo for the international game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, as well as for the Disney animated series &quot;Fillmore!&quot;. In addition to game shows, Larabie has also used 1960s and 1970s graphic logos, computer emulation, and other inspirations to design his fonts; most of his designs are display faces not meant for body text, with Larabie acknowledging that he had difficulties with italic type and, especially in his early career, had difficulties adapting katakana and hiragana to his designs. He is particularly known for his “ubiquitous futuristic and sci-fi fonts”; Larabie specialized in that style early in his career because he felt that, other than a few examples such as Bank Gothic, Microgramma and Eurostile, the market for that style was underserved.

Two of his typeface families, Marion and Superclarendon, are released with macOS. Larabie&#x27;s &quot;Canada 150&quot; is an extended version of his previous font Mesmerize (in turn based on 1920s calligraphic German sans-serifs such as Semplicità, Nobel and Kabel) with Cyrillic and First Nations alphabets included; it was commissioned by the Government of Canada to be the official typeface for the country&#x27;s sesquicentennial. The government paid him nothing for the custom work, which he subsequently placed into the public domain. He would proceed to release large portions of his Larabie Fonts library (inasmuch as he could, since some of the designs were derived from freeware that turned out to be copyrighted and thus could not be re-released), along with less successful designs for Typodermic, into the public domain in 2020, 2022 and 2024.

Larabie has drawn controversy for releasing fonts freely; other professional designers (among them Graphics Designers of Canada president Adrian Jean and competing type designer Rod McDonald) took particular umbrage at Canada 150, arguing that the government should have paid for a professionally drawn type because it had the money to do so, because not doing so would be a vote of no confidence in up-and-coming Canadian designers, and that professional designers would publish a superior product. Larabie responded to the criticism by noting that he appreciated that Canada had chosen a work by a Canadian artist (contrasting it with the use of Helvetica, of Swiss origin, on Canadian money) and said &quot;You can’t just throw a couple hundred grand at a problem and that’s the solution for every problem.&quot; He noted that when he had previously attended typography conferences, he had received the cold shoulder from attendees who felt he was threatening their business. In another case, attorneys for Metallica sent Larabie a cease and desist order over one of his freeware fonts, Pastor of Muppets, for having taken letter designs from Metallica&#x27;s wordmark; though Larabie maintained that, as Americans, they could not claim copyright over character designs as they did not meet a threshold of originality, he complied with the order (also noting that the use of the Muppets name could have drawn further trademark challenges), but found that the font had been too widely distributed to withdraw it from all the sites that had begun distributing it. Metallica never pressed any further action and Larabie, in his autobiography, stated that he wanted nothing further to do with the font and would never release it again.

<text>Captain John Fox Russell, VC, MC (27 January 1893 – 6 November 1917) was a Welsh physician, a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
Russell was born in Holyhead, Anglesey, on 27 January 1893 to William Fox Russell and Ethel Maria Fox Russell. At an early age, he passed the examination for a choristership at Magdalen College School, Oxford, where he was educated for three years before attending St. Bees School in Cumbria. While at School he was an enthusiastic member of the Officer Training Corps. He was also a member of the 1st Holyhead Scout Troop, Wolf Patrol.

==Military career==
Russell joined the Middlesex Hospital when only sixteen years of age and it was while he was in London that he joined the University of London Officers Training Corps, obtaining a commission in the Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1914. He was with them in camp when war was declared. Being anxious to qualify, he was seconded in order to complete his medical studies. After obtaining his diplomas, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps and was attached to a battery of the Royal Field Artillery. He later re-joined his old regiment R.W.F 1st/6th Battalion (Anglesey and Caernarvonshire) and went out to Egypt as medical officer.

In the First Battle of Gaza, Russell won the Military Cross. He was subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross at Tel-el-Khuwwilfeh, Palestine. The citation for the award read:

Russell was killed in action on 6 November 1917 and is buried at the Beersheba War Cemetery. A memorial to him and two other VC recipients, Captain Leefe Robinson of the Royal Flying Corps and Captain Richard Wain of the Tank Corps, was erected at St Bees School.

Russell&#x27;s Victoria Cross is on display at the Army Medical Services Museum, in the Defence Medical Services Training Centre, Keogh Barracks, Mytchett Place Road, Mytchett, in Surrey. 

In 2022 the newly built Headquarters of both Clwyd and Gwynedd ACF and a detachment of 203 Field Hospital at Kinmel Camp in Bodelwyddan was named Ty John Fox-Russell VC MC in his honour.

<text>Commander Wilfred St. Aubyn Malleson VC (17 September 1896 – 21 July 1975) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Malleson was born in Kirkee, India, the son of Major-General Sir Wilfrid Malleson and Ida Kathleen King, daughter of Frederick St Aubyn King. He attended the Royal Naval College Dartmouth from 1912 until 1914, being commissioned shortly before the start of World War I.

Malleson was an 18-year-old Midshipman in the Royal Navy during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25 April 1915 during the landing at V Beach, Cape Helles, Gallipoli, Turkey, Midshipman Malleson and three others (William Charles Williams, George Leslie Drewry, George McKenzie Samson) of HMS &quot;River Clyde&quot; assisted the commander (Edward Unwin) of the ship at the work of securing the lighters under very heavy rifle and Maxim fire. When the other midshipman with the party had failed, through sheer exhaustion to get a line from lighter to lighter, Midshipman Malleson swam with it himself and succeeded. The line subsequently broke and he afterwards made two further unsuccessful attempts at his self-imposed task.

He later achieved the rank of commander, and retired in 1948. He died at St Clement, Cornwall. His VC is on display at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1220049" wikidata="Q4202301" url="?curid=1220049" title="Amethyst incident">
<text>The &quot;Amethyst&quot; incident, also known as the Yangtze incident, was a historic event that occurred on the Yangtze River for three months in the summer of 1949, during the late phase of the Chinese Civil War. The incident involved the Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), who were in the middle of a river-crossing offensive to overthrow the Nationalist Government, and four British Royal Navy ships , , and . The British warships, whose claimed right of passage, per Treaty of Tientsin, along the Yangtze had been unchallenged previously since the late Qing dynasty, came under bombardment by PLA artillery and were forced to withdraw permanently from Chinese territorial waters.

The incident was celebrated in the British press as a dramatic escape while it has been widely celebrated in the communist People&#x27;s Republic of China as a milestone incident that marked the end of Western gunboat diplomacy in China and as one of the last nails in the coffin for the Century of Humiliation.

== Description ==
On 20 April 1949, during the Chinese Civil War between the nationalist Kuomintang-led Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party, the Royal Navy sloop , commanded by Lieutenant Commander Bernard Skinner, was cruising on the river Yangtze from Shanghai to Nanjing, to replace , which had been posted as guard ship for the British Embassy there. According to the Royal Navy, at about 08:31, after a burst of small arms fire, a People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) field gun battery on the north bank of the river fired a salvo of ten shells to warn &quot;Amethyst&quot; to stay away from the war zone. The salvo fell well short of the ship, and was assumed by the ship&#x27;s officers to be part of a regular bombardment of Nationalist forces on the south bank. Therefore, &quot;Amethyst&quot; ignored the warning and continued to cruise towards Nanjing. Speed was increased, and large Union flags were unfurled on either side of the ship, after which there was no more firing from this battery. 

===Initial damage and grounding===
At 09:30, as &quot;Amethyst&quot; approached Jiangyin (then romanized as Kiangyin) further up the river, it received sustained fire from a second PLA battery, as the PLA may have considered that the ship had violated the &quot;stay away warning&quot; from the war zone; additionally, the PLA may have thought &quot;Amethyst&quot; might attack and therefore began firing without having been fired upon.

The first shell passed over the ship. Then the bridge, wheelhouse and low power room were hit in quick succession, Lieutenant Commander Skinner was wounded mortally, and all the bridge personnel were disabled. The coxswain on the wheel, Leading Seaman Leslie Frank, was seriously injured and, as a result, the ship slewed to port and grounded on the river&#x27;s bank. Before the ship grounded, the order to open fire had been given, but when the director layer pulled the firing trigger, nothing happened because the firing circuits were disabled when the low power room was hit.

Lieutenant Geoffrey L. Weston, the ship&#x27;s first lieutenant, assumed command of the vessel, although he was also wounded himself. PLA shells exploded in the sick bay, the port engine room, and finally the generator, just after the injured Weston&#x27;s last transmission: &quot;Under heavy fire. Am aground in approx. position 31.10&#x27; North 119.20&#x27; East. Large number of casualties&quot;.

The order was given to fire in local control with each turret firing independently, but &quot;Amethyst&quot; had grounded in such a way that neither of the two forward gun turrets could bring their guns to bear on the PLA batteries, leaving the single stern turret to return fire. This turret was soon hit and disabled. None of the close-range weapons could be brought to bear on the PLA batteries. The shore batteries continued to bombard &quot;Amethyst&quot; causing more damage and casualties aboard.

===Attempted evacuation===
Some time between 10:00 and 10:30, Weston ordered the immediate evacuation to shore of anyone who could be spared. A boat was manned to take people the short distance to shore and some men swam ashore. The Communist batteries switched their fire to the men being evacuated and further evacuation was stopped. Fifty-nine ratings and four Chinese mess boys made it to the Kuomintang-controlled southern bank, but two men were assumed drowned while swimming ashore. Those who survived were joined by the seriously wounded from &quot;Amethyst&quot; who had been landed by sampan, with the assistance of the Chinese Nationalists the next day. Both parties were taken to a missionary hospital in Jiangyin, where they were met by a party from the British Embassy in Nanjing, and put on a train for Shanghai. Remaining aboard were about 60 unwounded men. The shelling had stopped, but no one could move on deck without drawing the attention of PLA snipers.

===Assistance from &quot;Consort&quot;===
By the time the shelling stopped at about 11:00, twenty-two men had been killed and thirty-one wounded. &quot;Amethyst&quot; had received more than fifty hits and holes below the waterline were plugged with hammocks and bedding. Rear Admiral Alexander Madden, the second in command of the East Indies Fleet, ordered the destroyer (Commander Robertson) to go from Nanjing, to &quot;Amethyst&quot;″s assistance, and the frigate (Captain Jay) to go from Shanghai to Jiangyin, down river from &quot;Amethyst&quot;. &quot;Consort&quot; was sighted, flying seven White Ensigns and three Union flags, steaming down from Nanjing, at .

&quot;Consort&quot; reached &quot;Amethyst&quot; at about three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon and was immediately bombarded. The shelling was too heavy to approach &quot;Amethyst&quot; and &quot;Consort&quot; therefore passed the other ship at cruising speed down river. &quot;Consort&quot; then turned and again closed on &quot;Amethyst&quot; to take the ship in tow, but &quot;Consort&quot; was again bombarded so intensely that it was obliged to abandon the attempt, although it answered the shore batteries with its full armament (including guns) and soon signalled that it had silenced most of the opposition. Half an hour later &quot;Consort&quot; made a second attempt to take &quot;Amethyst&quot; in tow, having turned downstream again. This attempt also failed and &quot;Consort&quot; sustained further damage and casualties during which the ship&#x27;s steering was affected. &quot;Consort&quot; therefore had to continue downstream out of the firing area with ten men killed and twenty-three wounded.

===Refloating and the arrival of Lieutenant Commander Kerans===
&quot;Amethyst&quot; was re-floated just after midnight on 21 April, after the ship was lightened, and it moved up river. The Assistant British Naval Attaché, Lieutenant Commander John Kerans, joined the ship on 22 April, after he had dealt with all the wounded and unwounded men who had been sent ashore. He assumed command of the ship that day.

During the next few days &quot;Amethyst&quot; moved several times, but each time it moved the batteries bombarded the ship which was finally forced to anchor off Fu Te Wei.

===Attempted assistance from &quot;London&quot; and &quot;Black Swan&quot;===
On 21 April, a signal was received: &quot;HM ships &quot;London&quot; and &quot;Black Swan&quot; are moving up river to escort the &quot;Amethyst&quot; down stream. Be ready to move.&quot; The cruiser , alongside &quot;Black Swan&quot;, were bombarded intensely as they attempted to help &quot;Amethyst&quot;, and retreated with 3 killed and 14 wounded.

=== Negotiations ===
On 30 April 1949, the Chinese Communists demanded that Britain, the United States, and France quickly withdraw their armed forces from any part of China. During the negotiations the Communists insisted that the British ship fired first. (Eventually, in 1988, the PLA commander Ye Fei, admitted that it was his troops that fired first, thinking it was an American naval intervention.) &quot;Amethyst&quot; remained guarded by the PLA for ten weeks, with vital supplies being withheld from the ship. Negotiations were ineffectual because Kerans would not accept the demand of Kang Yushao, the Chinese Communist representative, that he admit the British state had wrongly invaded Chinese national waters (the CPC insisted that it was illegal for &quot;Amethyst&quot; to cruise in the Yangtze River).

=== Escape ===
On 30 July 1949, &quot;Amethyst&quot;&#x27;s chain was slipped and the ship headed downriver in the dark, beginning a dash to escape from the Yangtze River by following in the wake of the civilian ship &quot;Kiang Ling Liberation&quot;, a fully-lit passenger vessel carrying Chinese refugees, allegedly in the hope that the observers ashore would be confused and not see the frigate in the dark, and to follow the path through the shoals taken by &quot;Kiang Ling Liberation.&quot; The movement of both ships was spotted, and both were challenged. The &quot;Kiang Ling Liberation&quot; answered correctly, whereas &quot;Amethyst&quot;, upon being challenged, opened fire. When the shore batteries replied, a Communist gunboat in the river began to fire back at the shore. In the confusion the &quot;Kiang Ling Liberation&quot; blacked out its lights while the &quot;Amethyst&quot; sped past. The fire of the batteries was then directed at the &quot;Kiang Ling Liberation&quot;, which was sunk by the gunfire, with many civilian casualties.

At 05:00 hours on 31 July, &quot;Amethyst&quot; approached the PLA forts at Baoshan and Wusong, which had their searchlights sweeping the river. At 05:25 a planned meeting with the destroyer occurred, at which time &quot;Amethyst&quot; sent the signal &quot;Have rejoined the fleet south of Wusong. No damage. No casualties. God save the King&quot;.

&quot;Concord&quot; had been ordered to prepare to provide gun support to &quot;Amethyst&quot; if it was bombarded by the shore batteries at Wusong. To achieve this it had moved up the Yangtze during the night, at action stations. Fortunately for the British, &quot;Amethyst&quot; was not detected by the shore batteries and the two ships then proceeded downriver until at 07:15 they ended action stations and after passing through the river&#x27;s outlet arrived at the Saddle Islands at 12:00 hrs to anchor and transfer much needed oil and stores.

After a brief stay at anchor, &quot;Concord&quot; transferred members of her own crew to &quot;Amethyst&quot; to augment the ship&#x27;s company, and the two ships proceeded to Hong Kong. Next day the cruiser (flying the flag of the Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet) and destroyer replaced &quot;Concord&quot; as escort and proceeded with &quot;Amethyst&quot; to Hong Kong. &quot;Concord&quot; was sent to Japan, after its complement was sworn to secrecy. &quot;Amethyst&quot; subsequently received a message of congratulations from King George VI:

===Aftermath===
==== British response ====
Soon after, on 5 August 1949, Lt Cdr Kerans was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions in bringing &quot;Amethyst&quot; to safety.

Future Governor of Hong Kong, Edward Youde, was part of the staff of the British Embassy at Nanjing. He negotiated unsuccessfully for the release of &quot;Amethyst&quot;. Youde was later made a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his actions.

&quot;Amethyst&quot; had a ship&#x27;s cat, named Simon, who was wounded seriously during the event. After receiving medical care, he recovered and continued to perform his duties catching rats, protecting the dwindling food supply during the 101-day siege and helped boost morale for the surviving sailors. Simon died soon after returning to the UK, having been awarded the Dickin Medal (sometimes referred to as &quot;the animals&#x27; Victoria Cross&quot;). He remains the only cat to receive this honor.

==== Chinese response ====
Chairman Mao Zedong considered the incident a great victory for the Chinese nation. Peng Dehuai later remarked: &quot;The era where Imperialists take over a piece of Asia by simply stacking a few guns, is over and never to return!&quot; Even many of the Nationalist troops on the south bank cheered the Communists as they bombarded the British warships. During the subsequent river crossing, many Nationalist defenders either surrendered, deserted or defected with negligible resistance.

==Popular culture==
The American radio series &quot;Suspense&quot; included an episode entitled &quot;Log of the Marne&quot; (22 October 1951), based largely on the events of the Yangtze incident.

Richard Todd played Kerans for the 1957 movie &quot;Yangtse Incident: The Story of HMS Amethyst&quot; (in the USA released most often as &quot;Battle Hell&quot;, but also as &quot;Escape of the Amethyst&quot; and &quot;Their Greatest Glory&quot;). For the movie, &quot;Amethyst&quot; was brought out of storage to play itself. As its engines were no longer operational, , a similar-looking ship, was used for pictures of the &quot;Amethyst&quot; moving .

Ted Duran played Kerans in a scene portraying the Amethyst incident in the 2019 movie &quot;Mao Zedong 1949&quot;.

<text>Hugh McDonald McKenzie (5 December 1885 – 30 October 1917) was a Canadian soldier who served during World War I. McKenzie was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. McKenzie received the award posthumously for his actions during an attack that took place during the Second Battle of Passchendaele in October 1917.

==Early life==
McKenzie was born in Liverpool, in the United Kingdom, on 5 December 1885. Shortly after his birth the family moved to Inverness, in Scotland. After his father died, the family moved to Dundee and McKenzie later found work with the Caledonian Railway Company. He emigrated to Canada in 1911, living with his wife, Marjorie, in North Bay, Ontario.

==Military service==
In August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, McKenzie volunteered for the Canadian Expeditionary Force and enlisted in Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. On enlistment, his attestation papers state that he had been previously employed as a teamster and had previous military experience. Serving initially as a private, McKenzie was promoted steadily through the ranks, reaching sergeant in September 1916 and becoming a company sergeant-major in early 1917. As a corporal, in early 1916, he had received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for actions while in command of a machine-gun section. In January 1917, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and was transferred to the Canadian Machine Gun Corps, attached to the 7th Brigade Machine Gun Company.

He was 31 years old, and a lieutenant when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

:On 30 October 1917 at the Meetscheele Spur, near Passchendaele, Belgium, Lieutenant McKenzie was &quot;in charge of a section of four machine guns accompanying the infantry in an attack. Seeing that all the officers and most of the NCOs of an infantry company had become casualties and that the men were hesitating before a nest of enemy machine-guns, he handed over his command to an NCO, rallied the infantry, organised an attack and captured the strong-point&quot;. As machine-gun fire from a pill-box nearby inflicted further casualties on the advancing Canadians, McKenzie conducted a brief reconnaissance of the position and after placing down troops in fire support positions, he led a frontal attack on the position. The pill-box was subsequently captured but McKenzie was killed in the effort.

Hugh McKenzie also received the French Croix de Guerre for his actions. He has no known grave and is commemorated on the Menin Gate war memorial in Ypres, Belgium.

When the award of his Victoria Cross was announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 12 February 1918, his surname was misspelled as &quot;Mackenzie.&quot; He is also commemorated by a plaque at the Rosebank Primary School, in Dundee, Scotland, which he attended as a child.
==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of the Regiments in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

<text>John Leslie Green VC (4 December 1888 – 1 July 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. An officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, he served on attachment to The Sherwood Foresters during the First World War. He was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions on 1 July 1916, during the Battle of the Somme.

==Early life==
John Leslie Green was born in Buckden, Huntingdonshire, on 4 December 1888 to John George and Florence May Green. His father owned land in the area and was also a Justice of the Peace. Known as Leslie to his family, Green attended Felsted School, and went on to study at Downing College, Cambridge. Pursuing a career as a doctor, he studied medicine at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London. He later worked at Huntingdon County Hospital, becoming qualified as a medical doctor in 1911.

==First World War==
After the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914, Green was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps. The early part of his military career was spent attached to the South Staffordshire Regiment as a medical officer before being transferred to the Field Ambulance. He was promoted to captain in April 1915. He was later posted to the Sherwood Foresters with which he went to France as part of the 46th (North Midland) Division, which fought in the Battle of Loos in September-October 1915. His brother, Second Lieutenant Edward Alan Green, who was serving in the 1/5th Battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment, also part of the 46th Division, was killed in the battle.

On the first day of the Battle of the Somme, the 46th Division was tasked with capturing Gommecourt Wood and then linking up the 56th (London) Division which had been allocated the objective of Gommecourt Park, to the south. This was a diversionary attack, designed to draw German forces away from the battlefield further south. Beginning its advance at 7:25 am, the Sherwood Foresters had great difficulty moving forward due to heavy machinegun fire coming from Gommecourt Wood. Green, at the rear of the battalion, came across Captain Frank Robinson, who had been wounded and become entangled in barbed wire. Under heavy machine gun fire, Green extracted Robinson to a nearby shellhole and performed initial treatment on the wounds before carrying him back to British lines. Robinson was wounded again during this process and Green was killed by gunfire to the head while attending to his latest wound. Although Robinson was taken to hospital for treatment, he died of his wounds two days later. Captain Robinson, 23, was a company commander with the 1/6th Battalion Sherwood Foresters, and was from Brampton, Chesterfield, Derbyshire. His father, Major William Robinson, was a well-known businessman and a previous mayor of Chesterfield. Captain Robinson had been in the army for four years and was regarded as both daring and courageous (&#x27;Derbyshire Times&#x27; July 8th 1916).

For his actions on 1 July 1916, Green was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a serviceman of the British Empire. The citation for his VC reads:
Green is buried at Foncquevillers Military Cemetery. In 1921, Green&#x27;s father built a memorial to the men of Buckden village who had been killed in the war and the names of his two sons are listed; they are also on the roll of honour in the village church. He appears on war memorials in Houghton where there is also a Leslie Green Road. Green is also remembered by plaques at Felsted School and the Royal Army Medical Corps College in London.

==Victoria Cross==
Green had married Edith Moss, also a doctor, earlier in the year in January and she was presented with Green&#x27;s VC by King George V on 7 October 1916. She later remarried and gifted the medal to the RAMC. It is displayed at the Museum of Military Medicine in Mytchett, Surrey.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Harry Greenwood, (25 November 1881 – 5 May 1948) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Greenwood was born in Victoria Barracks, Windsor, the eldest of nine children to Charles Greenwood and Margaret Abernethy.

==Military career==
Greenwood was 36 years old, and an acting lieutenant colonel in the 9th Battalion, the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, British Army, during the First World War, when he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 23 October 1918 at Ovillers, France, when the advance of the battalion was checked by enemy machine gun fire, Lieutenant-Colonel Greenwood single-handedly rushed the position and killed the crew. Subsequently, accompanied by two runners, he took another machine-gun post, but then found that his command was almost surrounded by the enemy, who started to attack. Repulsing this attack, the colonel led his troops forward, capturing the last objective with 150 prisoners, eight machine guns, and one field gun. On 24 October he again inspired his men to such a degree that the last objective was captured and the line held in spite of heavy casualties.

==Later life==
Greenwood died in Wimbledon, aged 66 and is buried at Putney Vale Cemetery. His medal is held at the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry Museum in Doncaster.

<text>Leopold I (c. 1290 – 28 February 1326), called The Glorious, was Duke of Austria and Styria – as co-ruler with his elder brother Frederick the Fair – from 1308 until his death. A member of the House of Habsburg, he was the third son of Albert I of Germany and Elisabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol, a scion of the Meinhardiner dynasty.

==Biography==

After the death of his eldest brother Duke Rudolph III in 1307 and the assassination of King Albert in 1308, Leopold became administrator of Further Austria, where he started a retaliation campaign against his father&#x27;s murderers. He converged with the royal House of Luxembourg and accompanied King Henry VII on his Italian campaign. In 1311, he helped to suppress a Guelph uprising in Milan under Guido della Torre, and to lay siege to the city of Brescia.

Upon Emperor Henry&#x27;s death, he strongly supported his brother Frederick in the 1314 election as King of the Romans. Despite all efforts, the Habsburgs only gained the votes of four prince-electors, while Louis IV of Bavaria, with support of the Luxembourgs, was elected by five. In the following armed conflict between the rivals, the forces of Leopold were supportive of his brother&#x27;s claims. In his ancestral homeland however, he incurred a decisive defeat by the Swiss Confederacy at the 1315 Battle of Morgarten.

When Frederick and their younger brother Henry had been captured at the Battle of Mühldorf in 1322, Leopold struggled for their release. He entered into negotiations with King Louis IV and even surrendered the Imperial Regalia he had kept at Kyburg Castle. The parleys failed and Leopold continued to attack the Bavarian forces of Louis, who unsuccessfully laid siege to the Swabian town of Burgau in 1324. After the king had failed to reach the approval of his election by Pope John XXII and was even banned, he released Frederick in 1325. The captive however had to promise to swear his brother to acknowledge Louis as his suzerain, which Leopold refused. Frederick voluntarily returned to the Bavarian court, where he and Louis finally agreed upon a joint rule.

Leopold died in Strasbourg shortly afterwards, on 28 February 1326. His remains were buried at Königsfelden Monastery in Windisch.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1315, Leopold married Catherine of Savoy (1284–1336), daughter of Amadeus V, Count of Savoy by his second wife, Marie of Brabant. They had two daughters:
#Catherine of Austria (1320–1349), who married Enguerrand VI, Lord of Coucy
#Agnes of Austria (1322–1392), who married Bolko II, Duke of Świdnica

<doc id="1220066" wikidata="Q7580152" url="?curid=1220066" title="Spouge">
<text>Spouge is a style of Barbadian popular music created by Jackie Opel in the 1960s. It is primarily a fusion of Jamaican ska with Trinidadian calypso, but is also influenced by a wide variety of musics from the British Isles and United States, including sea shanties, hymns, and spirituals. Spouge instrumentation originally consisted of cowbell, bass guitar, trap set, and various other electronic and percussion instruments, later augmented by saxophone, trombone, and trumpets. Of these, the cowbell and the guitar are widely seen as the most integral part of the instrumentation, and are said to reflect the African origin of much of Barbadian music.

Two different kinds of spouge were popular in the 1960s, &quot;raw spouge&quot; (&quot;Draytons Two style&quot;) and &quot;dragon spouge&quot; (&quot;Cassius Clay style&quot;). The spouge industry grew immensely by the end of the 1970s, and produced popular stars such as The Escorts International, Blue Rhythm Combo, the Draytons Two, The Troubadours, and Desmond Weekes. Desmond Weekes, the former lead singer of the Draytons Two, claims the 1973 album &quot;Raw Spouge&quot; to be &quot;the only 100 per cent spouge album ever produced&quot;. The album topped the charts in a number of islands, including St. Kitts, St. Lucia, and Dominica.

In 1950, Opel sang with a band at Coconut Creek Club, St. James, and his Jackie Wilson like voice soon made him popular. Opel appeared as a supporting act on some local shows with well-known overseas performers, and usually became the star performer as he vigorously performed every note and &quot;out shone&quot; the star. During this time, ska, the forerunner beat to reggae, was popular in Jamaica, and calypso was popular in Trinidad. Jackie Opel and his band The Troubadours developed the spouge beat as Barbados&#x27; answer to ska in Jamaica and calypso in Trinidad. Spouge became so popular that every local band and singer in Barbados and throughout the Caribbean recorded their music using the spouge beat.

After six years, the art form declined. Today, very little spouge is played on the airwaves. Spouge is only played on Jackie Opel Day, Independence Day, Heroes Day, and Errol Barrow Day. Spouge has also declined for other reasons:

#The man who created spouge, Jackie Opel, died in a car accident on March 9, 1970 at the age of 32.
#The Barbadian media does not promote spouge to the extent that it can.

In 2002, Caribbean Records Inc. released a CD entitled &quot;Vintage Spouge&quot; with hits on it such as &quot;Gimme Music&quot; by Mike Grosvenor, &quot;Any Day Now&quot; by Richard Stoute and a cover of Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;You Send Me&quot;, sung by spouge creator Jackie Opel.

In 2024 &quot;Pure Spouge Gospel&quot; EP album was released which features five original songs written and performed by Lana Spooner-Jack in the Barbadian-owned genre Spouge. The music for the album was composed by mixing and mastering engineer Jeffrey Y. Grosvenor at his studio &quot;Edge Cliff&quot;, in Gatineau, Quebec who added his own creativity by infusing African rhythms and Latin patterns. Each track on the album carries its own unique blend. The track &quot;Come and Buy (Isaiah 55)&quot; has a Meringue pattern that was altered to fit the Spouge rhythm; &quot;In the Same Boat&quot; has a Senagalese mbalax pattern. The congas are playing a Guaguancó pattern in &quot;Drop by Drop&quot;; and in the &quot;Christmas I Believe In&quot; track, the Spouge and the Cuban Bomba rhythms are played alternatively on the drum set. Very interesting combination! Of note, the song &quot;Singing Over Me&quot; is most likely the first Spouge song to be ever composed in the 3/4 time signature.

<text>Robert Vaughan Gorle VC (6 May 1896 – 9 January 1937) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Gorle was born in Southsea on 6 May 1896 and educated at Malvern College and Rugby School. Prior to the First World War was a farmer in South Africa.
Captain Gorle was promoted to temporary lieutenant in &quot;A&quot; Battery, 50th Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, British Army at Ledeghem, Belgium, during the First World War when he performed the deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. According to &quot;VCs of the First World War: The Final Days 1918&quot; by Gerald Gliddon, young Mr Gorle won his award on 1 October. It was the fourth and last battle of Ypres when 50th Brigade supported an attack at the village of Ledegham. The attack began at 06H15 for about 30 minutes of artillery fire. Neither allied troops to the left or right of the British troops had been able to make any progress against the enemy, even with the artillery. This resulted in the line of British troops faltering and beginning to retreat to the north of Ledegham. Upon seeing this, Mr Gorle took it upon himself to charge his gun at the enemy and fire over open sights, not once but three times. When the 38th (Ulster) division saw such gallantry and bravery in the face of the enemy infantry, they rallied to Gorle, and his men with the 18-pounder, and overcame the enemy machine gunner nests on Hill 41. Gorle was decorated nine months and 18 days later in the Quadrangle of Buckingham Palace by King George VI on 19 June 1919. It was a proud moment for his family after his father, Major Harry Vaughan Gorle D.S.O A.S.C., had only narrowly missed being awarded the V.C. too, receiving instead, the DSO for his efforts in the Boer Wars in South Africa.

His citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 14 December 1918 reads:

After the war Gorle returned to Africa, eventually settling in Southern Rhodesia where he was appointed as Sergeant-at-Arms to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly. He died on 9 January 1937 of yellow fever and was buried in Stellawood Cemetery, Durban, South Africa.
His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London after being purchased privately in 1993 through an agent from an unknown private seller whom is thought to have been Kevin Patience.

Jim Parque grew up poor in Southern California. His father made less than US$20,000 per year and his mother, a Vietnamese immigrant, worked at a textiles factory in Chinatown, Los Angeles. On this income, Parque&#x27;s parents struggled to provide for Parque and his brother. Parque himself had to work in a sweatshop in Los Angeles as a young boy.

Parque attended Crescenta Valley High School where he was mentored by former All-Star pitcher Jerry Reuss. As a senior, Parque compiled a 12–3 record and was voted the Pacific League Player of the Year and MVP. He also broke the school&#x27;s strikeout record. Parque began his high school baseball career at 5&#x27;1&quot; tall and roughly 110 pounds; the school was unable to find a jersey small enough to fit him. By the time he graduated high school, he still stood at only 5&#x27;5&quot; and weighed 132 pounds. Although he was recruited by such college baseball teams as the USC Trojans, UCLA Bruins and Miami Hurricanes, professional scouts showed little interest in him because of his size. Parque was not selected until the 50th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers.

====College====
From 1994 to 1997, Parque attended UCLA and led the Bruins to the College World Series in 1997. Parque earned second-team Smith Super Team honors in his sophomore season in 1996. In his junior year, Parque was voted first-team All-American by Baseball America, first-team All-Pac-10 Conference, second-team by the Sporting News, second-team by the American Baseball Coaches Association, and third-team by Collegiate Baseball. Parque is one of the most decorated pitchers in UCLA Baseball history. He currently ranks second in career games started with 50, second in career total innings pitched with 334 innings, second in career strikeouts with 319, third in career pitching wins with 25, and seventh in career complete games with 10. In terms of single season pitching records for the Bruins, Parque ranks third in wins with 13 in 1997, ninth for games started with 19 in 1997, ninth for innings pitched with 125 in 1996, fourth in strikeouts with 119 in 1997, and fifth in strikeouts with 116 in 1996.

===Professional career===
====Chicago White Sox====
In the supplemental draft, he was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 1st round. Parque made his major league debut the following year, pitching in 21 starts for the White Sox. He had an ERA of 5.10 with a 7-5 record in 113 innings.

In 1999, Parque finished the season with a 9-15 record in 30 starts.

He enjoyed his best season in , going 13–6 with a 4.28 ERA in 33 games (32 starts). Parque made his only postseason appearance starting game one against the Seattle Mariners in the ALDS. Parque outdueled Freddy Garcia in the performance, allowing 3 runs on 6 hits in 6 innings, but the bullpen blew the lead and the game in ten innings.

The 2001 season saw Parque pitch in 5 starts only after suffering a shoulder injury, which sidelined him for the rest of the season. The injury limited Parque to just 53.1 innings between 2001 and 2002 for the Chicago White Sox and spent most of those years in the minor leagues or rehabilitating his injured shoulder. Parque was released by the Chicago White Sox after the 2002 season.

====Tampa Bay Devil Rays====
Parque signed a minor league with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2003. He was released after posting a whopping 11.94 ERA in 5 starts. Parque failed to pitch out of the third inning in three of those five starts, but did spin a quality start against the Detroit Tigers on May 9, allowing just one hit (and four walks) through six innings for what would be his last Major League win.

====Arizona Diamondbacks====
In January, 2004, Parque signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks; however, he never appeared with the Major League team. After 50 innings with the AAA Tucson Sidewinders, Parque announced his retirement citing his recurring arm injury from .

====Return to baseball====
After being out of baseball for three years, Parque announced his willingness to return to the game of baseball. He started his return by instructing lessons for the Cook County Cheetas in Oak Lawn. &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that he threw his fastball in the range of 90 mph. On February 2, , he signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. He was released by Seattle after 45 uninspiring innings on May 31, 2007. He has since been linked to steroids in December 2007, though he denied the account in the &quot;Seattle Times&quot;. In a July 23, 2009 article in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Parque admitted using human growth hormone while rehabbing from a shoulder injury in 2003. At the time, HGH had not yet been banned by MLB.

<doc id="1220071" wikidata="Q8016349" url="?curid=1220071" title="William Olpherts">
<text>General Sir William Olpherts (8 March 1822 – 30 April 1902) was a British Indian Army officer and an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Olpherts was born on 8 March 1822 at Dartry, Blackwatertown near Armagh, son of William Olpherts of Dartry House, County Armagh. He was educated at the Royal School Dungannon, and in 1837 received a nomination to the East India Company&#x27;s Military Seminary at Addiscombe. He passed out in the artillery, and joined the headquarters of the Bengal Artillery at Dum Dum in December 1839.

On the outbreak of disturbances in the Tenasserim province of Burma, Olpherts was detached to Moulmein in October 1841 with four guns. Returning at the end of nine months, he was again ordered on field service to quell an insurrection in the neighbourhood of Saugor, and was thanked in the despatch of the officer commanding the artillery for his conduct in action with the insurgents at Jhirna Ghaut on 12 November 1842.

Having passed as interpreter in the native languages, Olpherts was given the command of the 16th Bengal Light Field Battery, and joined Sir Hugh Gough&#x27;s expedition against Gwalior. Olpherts&#x27;s battery was posted on the wing of the army commanded by General Grey, Lieutenant (Sir) Henry Tombs, V.C., being his subaltern. He was heavily engaged at Punniar on 29 December 1843, and was mentioned in despatches.

For his services in the Gwalior campaign Olpherts received the bronze decoration. Being specially selected by the governor-general, Lord Ellenborough, to raise and command a battery of horse artillery for the Bundelcund legion, he was at once detached with the newly raised battery to join Sir Charles Napier&#x27;s army in Sindh. His march across India, a distance of 1260 miles, elicited Napier&#x27;s highest praise. In 1846 Olpherts took part in the operations at Kot Kangra during the first Sikh war, when his conduct attracted the attention of (Sir) Henry Lawrence, and he was appointed to raise a battery of artillery from among the disbanded men of the Sikh army. He was then hurried off to the Deccan in command of a battery of artillery in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad, but was soon recalled to a similar post in the Gwalior contingent. In 1851 Olpherts applied to be posted to a battery at Peshawur, where he was under the command of Sir Colin Campbell and took part in the expedition against the frontier tribes. For this service he afterwards received the India General Service Medal sanctioned in 1869 for frontier wars. In the following year (1852) Olpherts took furlough to England, and was appointed an orderly officer at the Military College of Addiscombe.

==Crimean War==
On the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, Olpherts volunteered for service and was selected to join (Sir) William Fenwick Williams at Kars. On his way there, he visited the Crimea. Crossing the Black Sea, he rode over the Zigana mountains in the deep snow; but soon after reaching Kars he was detached to command a Turkish force of 7000 men to guard against a possible advance of the Russians from Erivan by the Araxes river. Olpherts thus escaped being involved in the surrender of Kars. Recalled to the Crimea, he was nominated to the command of a brigade of bashi bazouks in the Turkish contingent. On the conclusion of peace in 1856 he returned to India, and received the command of a horse battery at Benares.

==Indian Mutiny==
Olpherts served throughout the suppression of the Indian Mutiny (1857–59). He was with Brigadier James Neill when he defeated the mutineers at Benares on 4 June 1857, and accompanied Havelock during the Relief of Lucknow. His conduct in the course of that operation was highly distinguished and was to earn him the Victoria Cross. As a result, the Battery he commanded (now part of the Royal Regiment of Artillery) was later awarded his name as their title, commemorating both William Olphert and the distinguished actions of the unit that day. The Battery, 56 (Olpherts) Battery Royal Artillery, still exists today.

===Victoria Cross action===
His citation for the action reads:

===Later acts===
Olpherts almost surpassed this piece of bravery by another two days later. When the main body of Havelock&#x27;s force penetrated to the Residency, the rearguard consisting of the 90th with some guns and ammunition was entirely cut off. However, Olpherts, with Colonel Robert (afterwards Lord) Napier, sallied out with a small party, and by his cool determination brought in the wounded of the rearguard as well as the guns.

Sir James Outram, then in command of the Residency at Lucknow, wrote: »My dear heroic Olpherts, bravery is a poor and insufficient epithet to apply to a valour such as yours.« Colonel Napier wrote in his despatch to the same effect.

From the entry into Lucknow of Havelock&#x27;s force until the relief by Sir Colin Campbell on 21 November Olpherts acted as brigadier of artillery, and after the evacuation of the Residency by Sir Colin Campbell he shared in the defence of the advanced position at the Alumbagh under Sir James Outram. He took part in the siege and capture of the city by Sir Colin Campbell in March 1858, being again mentioned in despatches for conspicuous bravery. At the close of the campaign Olpherts received the brevets of major and lieutenant-colonel, as well as the Victoria Cross, the Indian Mutiny medal with two clasps, and the companionship of the Bath.

==Campaigns in India==
In 1859–60 Olpherts served as a volunteer under Brigadier (Sir) Neville Chamberlain in an expedition against the Waziris on the north-west frontier of the Punjab, thus completing twenty years of continuous active service. Olpherts&#x27;s dash and daring earned for him the sobriquet of &quot;Hell-fire Jack&quot;, but he modestly gave all the credit for any action of his to the men under him. From 1861 to 1868 he commanded the artillery in the frontier stations of Peshawur or Rawal Pindi, and in that year he returned home on furlough, when he was presented with a sword of honour by the city and county of Armagh. Returning to India in 1872, he commanded successively the Gwalior, Ambala, and Lucknow brigades, but quit the country in 1875 on attaining the rank of major-general. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877, general on 31 March 1883, and in 1888 became colonel commandant of the Royal Artillery. Olpherts was raised to the dignity of K.C.B. in 1886 and of G.C.B. in the 1900 Birthday Honours.

==Retirement==

He died at his residence, Wood House, Upper Norwood, on 30 April 1902, and was buried at Richmond Cemetery, Surrey (now in London). Olpherts married in 1861 Alice, daughter of Major-general George Cautley of the Bengal cavalry, by whom he had one son, Major Olpherts, late of the Royal Scots, and three daughters.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum, Chelsea.

<text>William Napier VC (20 August 1828 – 2 June 1908) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
William Napier was born at Keighley in Yorkshire, England on 20 August 1824, the son of Samuel Slater and his wife Mary (née Hartley).

William was educated at a private school and grew up in a military family. His uncle William Napier was a Grenadier Guard (2nd Battalion), who fought at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and was awarded the Waterloo Medal which he gave to William. By the time William had left school he had the urge to join the army. On 10 December 1846 he enlisted at Leeds, Yorkshire with the 13th Light Infantry.

==Crimea==
In 1855 William Napier left the England with the 1st Battalion, 13th (1st Somersetshire) (Prince Albert&#x27;s Light Infantry) Regiment of Foot under General Lord Mark Kerr, G.C.B., and arrived at Balaklava, Crimean peninsula, by sea on 29 June 1855.

William described Sevastopol as follows in 1897: 
The French had the honour of sealing the fate of Sevastopol. On 8 September 1855, they captured the Malakoff, the most formidable of its fortresses. The war was now virtually over. A treaty was concluded in March 1856. Following the battle at Sevastopol, Sergeant William Napier was awarded the Crimea Medal with clasp and the Turkish Medal.

He fought in the following battles in the Crimea:
* 16 August 1855, Battle of the Chernaya, Crimea
* 6 and 7 September 1855, in the trenches at Sevastopol
* 8 September 1855 – 1856, Capture of Redan and the fall of Sevastopol

==Indian Mutiny==
In May 1857 the native troops at Meerut mutinied, and the remainder of troops throughout Bengal soon followed their example. On 30 August 1857, the 1st Battalion under the command of Lord Mark Kerr, embarked at Port Elizabeth (South Africa) at 24 hours&#x27; notice, for India, and landed at Calcutta on 3 October 1857. On 27 March 1858, Lord Mark Kerr received orders from the Viceroy to march to the relief of Azimghur, which is about 50 miles north of Benares. They arrived at Azimghur on 5 April 1858, and commenced fighting the next morning. 

In this action Sergeant William Napier saw Private Benjamin Milnes lying severely wounded and went to his rescue. While surrounded by sepoys he bandaged Private Milnes wounds. Suddenly he was shot at, leaving a gaping wound over his left eye. Blinded by the blood pouring down his face, Sergeant Napier continued to fight back until he finally picked up Private Milnes and carried him to safety. This daring act was sufficient to induce Lord Mark Kerr to ask the sergeant whether he would like a commission. The sergeant declined that honour. For his heroism he was specially mentioned in dispatches and received the Victoria Cross and promotion to the rank of Sergeant Major. 

Through to December 1858 he fought in the following battles in India:
* Belwah
* Captaingunge
* Bustee
* Hurryah
* Debreheah
* Judgespore
* Bhanpore
* Domereagunge
* Toolsepore

In October 1862, Sergeant-Major William Napier VC, was in transit to Calcutta, and on 8 December 1862, he was discharged.

==Australia==
He left Calcutta on 21 December 1862 at 8:38 pm on the &quot;Madras&quot; and arrived in Melbourne, Australia in January 1863.

William found work as a clerk and later met and married Elizabeth Slater, the daughter of William and Margaret Slater of Ripon, Yorkshire, England, on 16 September 1863 in Melbourne. William and Elizabeth had a son, Alfred Stephen Slater Napier, and a daughter, Mary Elizabeth Napier, who both died in infancy. Elizabeth Napier died 25 April 1867, age 37.

William Napier married secondly, Ruth Ann Hirst, widow of Joseph Graham Hirst of Thornes by Wakefield, Yorkshire and daughter of Thomas Crompton Booth of Sowerby, Yorkshire, on 5 November 1869, at Bendigo, Victoria.

William Napier worked as a clerk and then a miner for a short time before he became a cordial manufacturer based in Mackey Street, Rochester, Victoria. William was a member and treasurer of the Rochester branch of the Masons. He was involved in many duties in Rochester and was listed as a pioneer of the district.

Sergeant-Major William Napier moved to Melbourne after his property burnt down. After a few years in Melbourne he became sick and returned to Rochester in 1907. He stayed with John and Ethel Abbey in Mackey Street next to where his home once was. He died on 2 June 1908 at the Abbey home, leaving his wife Ruth Ann Napier and his adopted stepdaughter Eliza. Ruth Ann Napier and her daughter moved to Western Australia. Ruth died at her grandson Ernest Alfred Winch&#x27;s home in 1924.

==Further information==
His adopted stepdaughter Eliza married William Henry Winch, ancestor of Lord John Napier-Winch of Western Australia. William Napier&#x27;s personal belongings are now held by Lord John Napier-Winch.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at Somerset Military Museum, Taunton, Somerset, England.

<doc id="1220073" wikidata="Q5220395" url="?curid=1220073" title="Danny Graves">
<text>Daniel Peter Graves (born August 7, 1973) is a Vietnamese-born American former professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB). Born to a Vietnamese mother and an American serviceman father, he is the only Vietnam-born player in the history of the major leagues and one of the few American players of Vietnamese descent. Graves pitched for most of his career for the Cincinnati Reds, where he was the team&#x27;s saves leader each year from 1999–2004, except for 2003 when he was a starting pitcher.

==Early life==
Graves was born in Saigon to Thao and Jim Graves, a U.S. Army sergeant, during the Vietnam War. The family fled the country when Graves was 14 months old after they learned of the impending fall of Saigon. After settling in the United States, Graves and his brother, Frank, spoke Vietnamese until teasing from classmates caused them to abandon the language.

===High school and college===
He graduated from Brandon High School in Brandon, Florida, and was awarded a baseball scholarship to the University of Miami. As a right-handed relief pitcher for the school as a junior, he posted a 0.89 earned run average and led collegiate baseball with a school-record 21 saves.

==Major League Baseball==
Graves was selected by the Cleveland Indians in the fourth round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft. Two days after being drafted, he tore his ACL during the College World Series. After a year of rehabilitation, he was named Cleveland&#x27;s top minor league pitcher of , and was in the major leagues a year later. He was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in July .

In his first nine seasons with Cleveland and Cincinnati, Graves compiled a 40–42 record as a pitcher with 406 strikeouts, a 3.89 ERA, and 172 saves in 755.2 innings. He is the only player ever to have more than one season in which all his hits were home runs. This happened in and , with one homer each.

In 2003, Graves was converted into a starter. He went 4–14 as a starter in 26 starts.

In 2004, Graves was again used as a closer. On April 16, 2004, Graves gave up a milestone and game tying home run to Sammy Sosa in the bottom of the ninth inning. The game ended two pitches later, with Graves allowing a walk off home run to Moisés Alou. Graves went on to save 41 games in the 2004 season.

The 2005 season did not start well for Graves. He struggled, posting a 7.36 ERA through 20 games. Fans in Cincinnati took notice and consistently booed Graves, leading up to a May 23 incident when Graves made an obscene hand gesture to a fan that leaned in the dugout after being called a &quot;gook&quot; while getting taken out of the game by Reds manager Dave Miley. Graves was quickly released by the Reds after the incident. He was later signed as a free agent by the New York Mets on June 11, 2005.

After putting up a 5.89 ERA with the Mets, he was designated for assignment on August 23, 2005. He cleared waivers and was sent to Triple-A Norfolk on August 26, but was called back up to the Mets when rosters expanded. Graves was 0–2 with an 18.00 ERA in five games with Norfolk.

On December 19, 2005, Graves signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. He pitched well in spring training, earning a spot in the Indian bullpen, but was designated for assignment on May 12, after he opened the season with a 2–1 record and 5.79 ERA in 13 relief appearances.

On May 18, 2006, Graves was assigned to the Indians&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons, in Buffalo. He finished the 2006 season with the Bisons, with a 4.01 ERA (1 Win 1 Loss).

Graves signed a minor league deal with the Rockies on December 19, 2006. He was released during Spring training in March 2007 prior to the season. During the 2007 season, Graves was on the roster of the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, leading the league in saves.

Graves later signed with the Minnesota Twins on March 30, , and played for the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings most of the year. He became a free agent at the end of the season and signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros in January . He was released by the Astros on March 25, .

==Broadcasting career==
Graves is now a baseball analyst on 120 Sports, &quot;The Rally&quot; on Bally Sports network, MLB.com, MLB Network Radio Sirius XM, and ESPN Radio. He joined the Reds Radio Network to do color commentary for select games in 2018.

==Personal life==
Graves is married with two children and has four children from a previous marriage.

<doc id="1220078" wikidata="Q5294768" url="?curid=1220078" title="Donald Macintyre (Indian Army officer)">
<text>Major General Donald Macintyre (12 September 1831 – 15 April 1903) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Macintyre was born in Kincraig, Scotland in 1831, the second son of Donald Macintyre of Calcutta and his wife, Margaret Mackenzie. Of his sisters, one married the army surgeon William Brydon, one of the few European survivors of the 1842 retreat from Kabul, and another James Travers, who won the VC in the Indian Mutiny.

Macintyre was educated at Addiscombe Military Seminary from 1848 to 1850.

==Career==
Macintyre obtained a commission in the Bengal Army of the British Indian Army in June 1850. Joining the 66th Gurkha Regiment, he served in a number of small campaigns on the North West Frontier. During the 1857–8 Indian Mutiny, he helped raise an extra Gurkha regiment (later the 4th Gurkha Rifles), and to protect the hill passes on the Kali Kumaon frontier from Rohilkhand rebels. He was promoted to captain in June 1862.

Becoming a major in June 1870, Macintyre served with the Lushai Expedition of 1871–2 as second in command of the 2nd Gurkha Rifles. It was here that Macintyre, a 40 year old major in the Bengal Staff Corps, was awarded the VC for the following deed:

He was also mentioned in dispatches and, in September 1872, promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel. Macintyre was appointed lieutenant-colonel on 14 January 1876. He commanded the 2nd Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Gurkhas at the occupation of Cyprus (1878) and in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–9).

In October 1887, Macintyre was appointed brevet colonel. He was granted the honorary rank of major general upon retirement in December 1880.

==Later life==
Macintyre was an extensive traveller and fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He published an account of his experiences in &quot;Hindu Koh: Wanderings and Wild Sports on and beyond the Himalayas&quot; (1889).

He subsequently lived in Fortrose, Ross-shire where he died on 15 April 1903, aged 71, and was buried in Rosemarkie churchyard.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Gurkha Museum in Winchester, Hampshire, England.

<doc id="1220079" wikidata="Q714992" url="?curid=1220079" title="Von Ryan's Express">
<text>Von Ryan&#x27;s Express is a 1965 World War II adventure film starring Frank Sinatra, Trevor Howard, and Raffaella Carrà, and directed by Mark Robson. Produced in CinemaScope, the film depicts a group of Allied prisoners of war (POWs) who conduct a daring escape by hijacking the freight train carrying the POWs and fleeing through German-occupied Italy to Switzerland. Based on the 1964 novel by David Westheimer, the film changes several aspects of the novel, most notably the ending, which is considerably more upbeat in the book. Financially, it became one of Sinatra&#x27;s most successful films.

==Plot==
Colonel Joseph Ryan, a USAAF P-38 pilot, is shot down over Italy and taken to a POW camp. Ryan insists that the camp commander, Major Basilio Battaglia, salute him as a superior officer, which the sympathetic second-in-command, Captain Vittorio Oriani, translates. Most prisoners are British from the 9th Fusiliers. Their previous commanding officer recently died due to being placed in the &quot;sweat box&quot; as punishment for hitting Battaglia. Major Eric Fincham is the senior British officer until Ryan, being senior, arrives and assumes command.

Italy is close to surrender, and Ryan declines to support Fincham&#x27;s escape attempts. When Fincham captures American prisoners stealing medical supplies from a British secret hoard, Ryan orders Fincham to distribute the medicines to the seriously ill prisoners.

He infuriates Fincham by revealing an escape plan to Battaglia in exchange for prisoners being treated better. When Battaglia refuses to issue new clothing, Ryan orders prisoners to strip and burn their filthy uniforms. Battaglia throws Ryan into the sweat box as punishment.

When Italy surrenders, the guards flee and Ryan is freed; the British promptly try Battaglia as a war criminal. He portrays himself as a broken man who has repudiated fascism. Rather than executing him, Ryan sentences him to the sweat box.

A German fighter plane overflies the camp, forcing Ryan and the men to flee into the Italian countryside with Oriani&#x27;s help. They hide out in some ruins while Ryan attempts to contact Allied forces. The next morning, the Germans recapture the prisoners and load them onto a northbound train. Fincham assumes Oriani betrayed them until he is found severely battered aboard the train&#x27;s prisoner carriage. The Germans then shoot all ill prisoners. Fincham blames Ryan for letting Battaglia live, and derogatively calls him &quot;&quot;von&quot; Ryan&quot;. The train travels to Rome, where a German officer, Major von Klemment, takes command.

Ryan pries up the railcar floorboards. That night, when the train stops, Ryan, Fincham, and Lt. Orde sneak out and kill several guards. They free a covered goods wagon of POWs, who help them kill the remaining guards whose uniforms they then don as a disguise. Ryan and Fincham capture von Klemment and his mistress, Gabriella. As the train moves out, another train follows. Von Klemment reveals that the second train is carrying German troops and is on the same schedule. Further, von Klemment is to receive orders at each railway station. A German-speaking British chaplain, Captain Costanzo, impersonates the German commander to ensure their passage through the next station in Florence. There, a plainclothes Gestapo officer notices Ryan&#x27;s American wristwatch, then boards the train and buys it from him. The prisoners leave quickly.

Through documents received in Florence, they learn that both trains are headed towards Innsbruck, Austria. Through trickery and a quickly forged typewritten order, the prisoners switch their train onto a different line at Bologna. The troop train continues on toward Innsbruck. Von Klemment and Gabriella are kept bound and gagged, but they escape at a stop, killing Orde. Both are shot by Ryan and the train proceeds.

Later, German commanders learn of the train&#x27;s diversion and begin queries. That night the train stops at what is thought to be a clearing and the men get off to head for safety; aircraft, which Ryan identifies as Lancaster bombers, appear overhead and begin bombing the area. Ryan orders everyone back on the train. The train restarts and passes an oil storage yard being bombed by the Allied aircraft. Several cars catch fire, and the train must stop to aid the wounded and release burning goods wagons.

With three dead and some sixty wounded, Oriani and the train&#x27;s Italian engineer tell Ryan and Fincham that the only option is to reroute the train at Milan to neutral Switzerland. Waffen-SS troops, led by Colonel Gortz, have discovered the earlier ruse and await the train, but are slowed when Oriani and the men disable a signal box at Milan, knocking out the track diagrams inside the control center. The prisoners reroute the train northwest through manual switching and drive straight through without stopping.

When the train diagrams are finally reactivated, Gortz realizes he has been outmaneuvered and leads troops in pursuit. As the Alps appear, the prisoner train is attacked by German aircraft, rocket fire collapsing boulders onto a section of track. The POWs clear the track and use sections of the rails behind them to repair damaged sections and attempt to derail the oncoming German train. As the Germans race up from behind, Ryan, Fincham, and others stay behind to hold them off. The Germans see the sabotaged railway tracks and stop in time. Many soldiers are killed in the resulting battle, including Bostick. The prisoner train moves out as the men run for the moving rear platform with the Germans in pursuit. Most make it onto the train, but Ryan is killed by gunfire still running for the train as it approaches Switzerland.

==Production==

===Original novel===
The novel was published in 1963. The novelist David Westheimer had been a POW during World War II. He witnessed the bombing of Bolzano in 1943 from a box car. Martin Levin, reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said the novel &quot;has everything for the screen but the camera directions.&quot;

===Development===
The novel was a best seller and 20th Century Fox bought the film rights for a reported $125,000. The studio assigned Saul David to produce and Mark Robson to direct. Robson had intended to make &quot;The Centurians&quot;, but this was delayed when his chosen star, Anthony Quinn, was unavailable. Frank Sinatra had read the novel and wanted to buy the film rights himself; when he heard they had been lost to Fox, he offered his services for the lead role.

&quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; was a project keenly undertaken by 20th Century Fox, which was still financially reeling after the extravagance and critical bashing of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. Fox, in a bid to prove that they were still able to make films on an epic scale, shot extensively on location in Europe and built a full-scale prison camp as opposed to shooting on a backlot. It was producer Saul David&#x27;s first film for Fox. He followed it with &quot;Our Man Flint&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, and &quot;In Like Flint&quot;.

===Shooting===
Rumours of a personality clash between star Frank Sinatra, who was flown by helicopter to the set, and director Mark Robson were not enough to cause problems as the film was shot with relatively little trouble. However, Sinatra did insist that the ending of the film be altered, ending any chance of a sequel. Sinatra also insisted the film be shot in Panavision rather than Fox&#x27;s CinemaScope.

The film score was written by Jerry Goldsmith.
&quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; achieved reality using aircraft, trains, and wheeled vehicles photographed on location along with the occasional model. The aircraft alluded to as &quot;Messerschmitts&quot; were indeed Messerschmitt Bf 108s. A majority of the film was shot on location around Northern Italy in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo and Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station in Florence (in reality is Roma Ostiense railway station). The Ferrovie dello Stato/Italian State Railway closely cooperated on the production, as reflected in the film&#x27;s closing acknowledgment credit, providing a complete train headed by the specially-bulled up FS Class 735.236. The train which the Nazis commandeer to pursue the escaping POWs is headed by a Franco-Crosti boiler-fitted Class 743.

The railway sequence at the film&#x27;s conclusion, however, was shot in the Caminito del Rey walkway in the limestone gorge of El Chorro and in the adjacent railway bridge, near Málaga in Andalucía, Spain. This switch from filming in Italy was probably done as the bridge looked more suitably attractive for presenting the final set piece than anything that could be found on the Italian rail network. The train featuring in these sequences was laid on by the RENFE/Spanish National Railways and altered to resemble the Italy-based train. Interiors were completed at 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles. The POW camp (Campo Concentramento Prigioneri di Guerra 202) was also built in the front lot of the Studios.

==Reception==
===Critical===
Critics liked &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; noted, &quot;Mark Robson has made realistic use of the actual Italian setting of the David Westheimer novel in garmenting his action in hard-hitting direction and sharply drawn performances.&quot; Frank Sinatra&#x27;s daughter Nancy noted in her biography of her father that his performance fuelled speculation of another Academy Award nomination. &quot;Time Out&quot; London called the film a &quot;ripping adventure&quot; that was &quot;directed with amused panache by Robson, and helped no end by a fine cast...&quot;, while the BBC&#x27;s TV, film and radio listings magazine &quot;The Radio Times&quot; described it as &quot;a rattlingly exciting Second World War escape adventure, with a well-cast Frank Sinatra...&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $17,111,111 ($ in 2024 consumer dollars) at the North American box office, equating to $7,700,000 ($ in 2024 consumer dollars) taken in box office rentals. &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; as the 10th-highest-grossing film of 1965. Additionally, this was Sinatra&#x27;s highest-grossing and biggest-earning film of the decade.

According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $12,600,000 in rentals to break even and made over $17,000,000, meaning it made a profit.

===Awards===
The film was nominated for a Best Sound Editing (Walter Rossi) Academy Award in 1966, while the Motion Picture Sound Editors also nominated the film for Best Sound Editing in a Feature Film.

British Channel 4 ranked &quot;Von Ryan&#x27;s Express&quot; number 89 on their list of 100 Greatest War Films, commenting, &quot;A ripping yarn culminating in a wild train dash through [Italy], with director Mark Robson cranking up the tension and releasing it with some excellent action set-pieces.&quot; It has a 90% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 20 reviews.

<doc id="1220081" wikidata="Q5076051" url="?curid=1220081" title="Charles Calveley Foss">
<text>Brigadier Charles Calveley Foss, (9 March 1885 – 9 April 1953) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A professional soldier in the British Army, he was awarded the VC in 1915 for his actions during the Battle of Neuve Chapelle.

==Early life==
Charles Foss was born on 9 March 1885 in Kobe, Japan. His father, Reverend Hugh James Foss, was the Bishop of Osaka. His mother, from Chester, died when he was around the age of nine. He was educated in England, where he attended Marlborough College. In 1904, he was commissioned into the British Army&#x27;s Bedfordshire Regiment having spent the two years prior at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst in Berkshire. Posted to the regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, in 1912 he was promoted to captain.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, Foss was serving in South Africa as adjutant of his battalion. The battalion was shortly dispatched to the Western Front, arriving at Zeebrugge in early October 1914, as part of the 21st Brigade, 7th Division, and fought in the First Battle of Ypres later that month. By the time of the battalion&#x27;s withdrawal from the frontline in early November, he was the senior surviving frontline officer. The following year he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in recognition of his service at Ypres.

In early March 1915, the 7th Division was tasked with a role in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. Foss&#x27; battalion advanced to the northwest of Neuve Chapelle on the opening day of the battle, 10 March, in support of the Royal Scots Fusiliers to the east. They held their position for the following day but on 12 March the neighbouring Royal Scots Fusiliers had to fend off an attack on their trenches by the Germans. A section of their trenches were lost. Foss led a group of men with handheld bombs on a flanking raid and was able to recapture the lost trench. It was during this raid that he performed the deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation reads as follows:
Of the men who accompanied Foss during his attack, several were recognised with gallantry decorations; one, Private William Eade, was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Order of St George. Sergeant William Peggs was also awarded the Order of St George while a third man, Private Walter Scrivener, killed the day after Foss&#x27;s action, was mentioned in despatches.

The 2nd Battalion was withdrawn from the frontline on 14 March. Later in the year Foss was married to Vere Katherine , the widow of an Indian Army officer. By the time of the gazetting of his VC, Foss was serving as the brigade major of the Bedfordshire Regiment. While King George V was on an inspection tour of the 7th Division on 28 October 1915, he presented the VC to Foss.

Shortly afterwards Foss was appointed a staff officer at 20th Brigade. At the end of the year, he was mentioned in despatches, the first of five such mentions during the course of the war. Later, having been promoted to major, he was on the staff of the 2nd, then 1st Canadian Divisions, and finally the Canadian Corps. During this time he was awarded the Order of Danilo 4th Class (Montenegro). In 1918, he instructed at a staff school in Cambridge before returning to the Western Front shortly before the end of the war with a British infantry corps.

==Later life==
At the conclusion of hostilities, Foss was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel and appointed chief of staff at the 57th Division and remained in this position into 1919, at which time he went to the Staff College at Camberley for further training. He graduated the following year. He spent five years at the War Office before being given command of the King&#x27;s Liverpool Regiment. In 1933 he was promoted to colonel and posted to Burma as commander of the Rangoon Brigade Area. He was also appointed as aide-de-camp to King George V. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1937 New Year Honours. He retired the same year having achieved the rank of brigadier.

During the Second World War, he was a member of the home guard in Bedfordshire and also commandant of the Bedfordshire Army Cadet Force. In 1943 he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Bedfordshire. He died on 9 April 1953 in London, survived by his second wife who he had married in 1950. His first wife had died in 1947. He is buried in West Hill Cemetery at Winchester in Hampshire.

==Medals==
Foss&#x27; medals, which in addition to the VC, CB and DSO, included the 1914 Star with Mons clasp, the British War Medal, Victory Medal with Mentioned in Despatches oak leaf, Defence Medal, War Medal 1939–1945, George VI Coronation Medal and the Order of Danilo 4th Class (Montenegro) are displayed at the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regimental Gallery at the Wardown Park Museum in Luton, Bedfordshire.

<text>Lance Sergeant Thomas Patrick Neely, (28 March 1897 – 1 October 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with The King&#x27;s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment, he was awarded the VC for his actions in late September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive of the First World War. He was killed in action a few days later.

==Early life==
Thomas Neely was born on 28 March 1897 in Poulton-cum-Seacombe, Wallasey, then part of Cheshire, one of seven children of James and Agnes Neely. The family surname was often spelt Neeley. His father was a gasfitter but performed labouring work for several years. The family moved to Walton in Liverpool, where Neely attended St. Fancis de Sales School. After finishing his education, Neely worked for a grain mill that produced animal feed.

==First World War==
In September 1914, Neely enlisted in the British Army. Of small stature, he was posted to the Cheshire Regiment&#x27;s Bantam Battalion, but later transferred to The King&#x27;s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment, part of 76th Brigade, 3rd Division. In July 1918, Neely&#x27;s award of a Military Medal (MM) was gazetted and he was sent on leave shortly afterwards. On his return to his unit, the 8th Battalion, he was promoted to corporal.

During the Battle of the Canal du Nord on 27 September, the 8th Battalion was leading the advance of 76th Brigade. It encountered a series of machinegun posts at the village of Flesquières, which made casualties of most of the battalion&#x27;s officers. The advance was held up until Neely and two others assaulted the machinegun posts. Later in the advance, he made additional solo forays to deal with German-held positions that were delaying the battalion. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation read as follows:
Immediately after his VC-winning action, Neely was promoted in the field to lance sergeant. Neely was killed in action just a few days later, on 1 October 1918, at Rumilly-en-Cambrésis, just south of Cambrai. He was buried at Masnieres British Cemetery in Marcoing. King George V presented Neely&#x27;s VC to his parents in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 27 February 1920.

There are several memorials to Neely; a plaque at the Priory in Lancaster, a memorial board in Wallasey Town Hall, and he is listed, along with the names of 11 other VC winners from the Wirral, Ellesmere Port, and Neston districts, on a plaque on the Birkenhead Cenotaph Memorial.

==Medals==
Neely&#x27;s family retained his medals, absent the campaign medals to which he was entitled but which was never received, for several decades. In June 2010, it was alleged that the VC and MM was stolen from his grand-nephew&#x27;s home. However, this was found to be a hoax and the grand-nephew was later charged for wasting police time. The family later put the VC and MM up for auction and it was sold on 25 November 2010 to a private buyer for £110,000.

<text>Randolph Cosby Nesbitt VC (20 September 1867 – 23 July 1956) was a South African-born Rhodesian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest British and Commonwealth award.

Nesbitt was born at Queenstown, Cape Colony, South Africa. He was a captain in the Mashonaland Mounted Police, Rhodesian Forces during the Mashona Rebellion. On 19 June 1896 near Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Captain Nesbitt led a patrol consisting of only 13 men to rescue miners at the Alice Mine in Mazoe Valley, who were surrounded by hordes of rebels. Blakiston, Nesbitt, Routledge and Pascoe were the four main leaders and instigators of the rescue. Captain Nesbitt&#x27;s patrol fought their way through the enemy, rescuing the beleaguered party (including three women), transporting them back to Salisbury in spite of heavy fighting in which three of the small party were killed and five wounded.

In 1909, Nesbitt became a Native Commissioner for the British South Africa Police (a paramilitary Rhodesian force). He retired in 1928 after 40 years of service with the Rhodesian police and civil service, returning to South Africa on account of his wife&#x27;s health. Nesbitt died in South Africa on 23 July 1956. His remains were cremated at Cape Town.

Nesbitt&#x27;s medal was kept in the Museum in Salisbury until independence. It was loaned out, once a year, to Blakiston School, when the event of the Mazoe Patrol was commemorated.

<doc id="1220090" wikidata="Q587151" url="?curid=1220090" title="British invasions of the River Plate">
<text>The British invasions of the River Plate were two unsuccessful British attempts to seize control of the Spanish colony of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, located around the Río de la Plata in South America – in present-day Argentina and Uruguay. The invasions took place between 1806 and 1807, as part of the Napoleonic Wars, War of the Third Coalition at a time when Spain was an ally of Napoleonic France. In Argentine historiography, the two successive defeats of the British expeditionary forces are known collectively as the &quot;Reconquista&quot; and the &quot;Defensa&quot;, respectively. 

==Overview==
The invasions occurred in two phases. A detachment from the British army occupied Buenos Aires for 46 days in 1806 before being expelled. In 1807, a second force stormed and occupied Montevideo, remaining for several months, and a third force made a second attempt to take Buenos Aires. After several days of street fighting against the local militia and Spanish colonial army, in which half of the British forces were killed or wounded, the British were forced to capitulate and withdraw from Montevideo two months later.

The social effects of the invasions are among the causes of the May Revolution. The criollos, who had so far been denied important positions, could get political strength through military roles. The successful resistance with little help from Spain fostered the desire for self-determination. An open cabildo and the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires deposed the viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte and designated instead the local popular hero Santiago de Liniers, which was a completely unprecedented action: before that, the viceroy was only subject to the King of Spain himself, and no one from the colonies had authority over him.

==Background==

Pedro de Mendoza founded the &quot;Ciudad de Nuestra Señora del Buen Ayre&quot; (&quot;The City of Our Lady of the Fair Winds&quot;) on 2 February 1536 as a Spanish settlement. The site was abandoned in 1541, but it was re-established in 1580 by Juan de Garay with the name &quot;Ciudad de la Santísima Trinidad y Puerto de Santa María del Buen Ayre&quot; (City of the Most Holy Trinity and Port of Saint Mary of the Fair Winds), and the city became one of the largest in the Americas. A Portuguese colony was founded at Colonia del Sacramento, on the opposite bank of the Río de la Plata, in 1680. To deter Portuguese expansion, the Spanish founded Montevideo in 1726, and Colonia was finally ceded to Spain under the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1777, one year after the creation of the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, the forerunner of modern Argentina.

The South Sea Company was granted trading concessions in South America in the time of Queen Anne, under the Treaty of Utrecht. The British had long harboured ambitions in South America, considering the estuary of the Río de la Plata as the most favourable location for a British colony.

The Napoleonic Wars played a key role in the Rio de la Plata conflict and since the beginning of the European conquest of the Americas, the British had been interested in the riches of the region. The Peace of Basel in 1795 ended the war between Spain and France. In 1796, by the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain joined France in its war with the United Kingdom, thus giving the United Kingdom cause for military action against Spanish colonies. In 1805 the United Kingdom judged it the right moment after the defeat of the Franco-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar. This battle forced Spain to reduce to a minimum its naval communications with its American colonies. Historically, Buenos Aires had been relatively neglected by Spain, which sent most of its ships to the more economically important city of Lima. The last time a significant Spanish military force had arrived in Buenos Aires had been in 1784.

===British interest in the region===

Great Britain had long harboured interests in taking control of the region from the Spanish before the invasions. Attempts had been made by the British in past conflicts to establish a foothold in South America, like in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias, at the peak of the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear.

In 1711, John Pullen stated that the Río de la Plata was the best place in the world for making a British colonial trading base. His proposal included Santa Fe and Asunción, and would have generated an agricultural area with Buenos Aires as the main port. Admiral Vernon also declared the benefit of opening markets in those areas in 1741. By 1780 the British government approved a project of colonel William Fullarton to take the Americas with attacks from both the Atlantic (from Europe) and the Pacific (from India). This project was cancelled.

In 1789 war between Great Britain and Spain seemed imminent after the Nootka Crisis. The Venezuelan revolutionary Francisco de Miranda took the opportunity to appear before prime Minister William Pitt with his proposal to emancipate the New World territories under Portuguese and Spanish rule and turn them into a great independent empire governed by a descendant of the Incas. The plan presented in London requested the assistance of Great Britain and the United States to militarily occupy the major South American cities, ensuring that the people would greet the British cordially and would rush to organize sovereign governments. In return for this help, the British would receive the benefits of unrestricted trade and usufruct of the Isthmus of Panama, in order to build a channel for the passage of ships. Pitt accepted the proposal and began to organize the expedition. The Nootka Convention in 1790 ended hostilities, and the Miranda mission was canceled.

Nicholas Vansittart made a new proposal in 1796: the plan was to take Buenos Aires, then move to Chile and attack from there the Spanish stronghold of El Callao in Peru. This proposal was canceled the following year, but was improved by Thomas Maitland in 1800 as the Maitland Plan. The new plan was to seize control of Buenos Aires with 4,000 soldiers and 1,500 cavalry, move to Mendoza, and prepare a military expedition to cross the Andes and conquer Chile. From there, the British would move from sea to seize Peru and then Quito.

All these proposals were discussed in 1804 by William Pitt, Lord Henry Melville, Francisco de Miranda and Sir Home Riggs Popham. Popham did not believe a complete military occupation of South America was practical but argued for taking control of key locations to allow the main objective, to open new markets for the British economy. Although there was consensus for weakening Spanish control over its South American colonies, there was no agreement as to the system and the moment to take such action. For instance, it was not even agreed whether the cities be turned into British colonies after their capture or just be made into British protectorates.

== First invasion==

In 1805 Popham received orders to escort the David Baird-led expedition against the Dutch colony of the Cape of Good Hope, which was allied with Napoleon. With nearly 6,300 men they took it in January 1806. Popham received new orders from the admiralty to patrol the east coast of South America, from Rio de Janeiro to the Río de la Plata, in order to detect any attempt to counterattack the Cape. However, Popham had the idea of taking the Río de la Plata with a military action similar to the one made at the Cape. His agent William White had informed him about the local politics of the city, such as the discontent among some groups about the restrictive regulations enforced by Spain about international commerce. Popham manifested Baird his will to take the zone, with or without his help. Baird gave him the 71st Regiment of Infantry, artillery and 1,000 men to attempt the invasion. Baird promoted William Carr Beresford to general and designated him vice governor of the zone if it was taken. The expedition got reinforcements of 300 men from the Artillery and [St Helena] Regiment.

The Spanish Viceroy, Marquis Rafael de Sobremonte, had asked the Spanish Crown for reinforcements many times, but only received a shipment of several thousand muskets and instructions to form a militia. Buenos Aires was then a large settlement housing approximately 45,000, but the Viceroy was reluctant to give weapons to the Creole population. The best troops had been dispatched to Upper Peru, present-day Bolivia, to guard the frontiers from Túpac Amaru II&#x27;s revolt, and when Sobremonte learned of the British presence in the area he dispatched the remaining troops to Montevideo, considering that the attack would be in that city. Thus, the British found Buenos Aires almost defenseless.

The British took Quilmes, near Buenos Aires, on 25 June 1806, and reached and occupied Buenos Aires on 27 June. The Viceroy fled to Córdoba with the city&#x27;s treasury, but lost it to British forces during his escape. Although his action was in line with a law enacted by former Viceroy Pedro de Cevallos, which required the treasury to be kept safe in case of a foreign attack, he was seen as a coward by the population because of it.

Initially the British forces were met with a lukewarm welcome by the residents of the city, with some wealthy families throwing feasts in honour of the British officers. Nevertheless, some political figures remained antagonistic. Manuel Belgrano said &quot;Queremos al antiguo amo o a ninguno&quot; (we want the old Master or none at all) before leaving to Uruguay. Religious leaders swore loyalty as well, after the promise that the Roman Catholic religion would be respected. The Royal Audience ceased its activities. Some merchants were displeased by the repeal of the Spanish monopoly and the opening to British trade, as it harmed their interests; one of their leaders was Martín de Álzaga.

Juan Martín de Pueyrredón organised a militia near the city, but was discovered before being ready, and his troops were defeated. Santiago de Liniers, who was assigned to guard a nearby coast defense, got into the city and weighed the situation. He convinced Álzaga to hold on his plan, and moved to Montevideo. The governor Pascual Ruiz Huidobro gave him command of 550 veterans and 400 soldiers to return to Buenos Aires and attempt the re-conquest. Sobremonte was doing the same in Córdoba, but Liniers got to Buenos Aires first.

On 4 August 1806, Liniers landed at Las Conchas, north of Buenos Aires, and advanced with a mixed force of Buenos Aires line troops and Montevideo Militia toward the city. On 10 August he took control of the strategic points of Miserere and El Retiro, holding the north and west entries to the city. Beresford finally surrendered on 14 August. An open cabildo decided afterwards to depose Sobremonte from having military authority, and giving such authority, instead, to the victorious Liniers. Sobremonte would not return to Buenos Aires, and moved to Montevideo instead. The open cabildo also decided to prepare the city against the possibility of a British counter-attack.

Foreseeing the possibility of a second invasion, militias were formed by the Spanish and criollos, such as the Patricios, Arribeños, Húsares (of Pueyrredón), Pardos and Morenos. The creation of such local forces created concern within the Spanish elite, fearful of an attempt of secession from the Spanish Crown.

On this first invasion, the 71st Regiment of Foot lost both of its Regimental Colours during the combat, which are currently held in Argentina. On the second invasion, there was a frustrated attempt to recover both flags. They were retaken by the Buenos Aires militia and returned to the Santo Domingo convent.

== Second invasion ==
=== Battle of Montevideo ===
On 3 February 1807 Montevideo, defended by approximately 5,000 men, was besieged at 2:00am by a 15,000 strong British force in a joint military and naval operation under General Sir Samuel Auchmuty and a naval squadron under Admiral Sir Charles Stirling. Reinforcements for the defenders came en route from Buenos Aires, so that the rapid success of the operation was essential.

Swiftly breached, the city was then assaulted by the 40th regiment and the elite 95th (Rifle) regiment. Once inside the walls, the British met heavy resistance as the Spanish fought to halt their advance, but they gradually spread out and forced back the defenders. On the other side of the city a second assault was launched, spearheaded by the 87th Regiment of Foot taking the Spanish defenders in the rear. The Spanish Governor Ruiz Huidobro accepted Auchmuty&#x27;s demand of unconditional surrender around 5:00 a.m. The Spanish took 600 casualties and a further 2,000 were taken prisoner while the British had taken 600 casualties.

On 10 May, Lieutenant-General John Whitelocke arrived in Montevideo to take overall command of the British forces -this had about 13,000 soldiers, due to the losses suffered in Montevideo – on the Río de la Plata, landing on 27 June.

=== Second Battle of Buenos Aires===

On 1 July, the force led by Liniers engaged the British but was overwhelmed by superior numbers at Miserere, in the city environs. At this crucial moment, Whitelocke did not attempt to enter the city, but twice demanded the city&#x27;s surrender. Meanwhile, Buenos Aires&#x27; mayor Martín de Álzaga organised the defence of the city by digging trenches, fortifying buildings and erecting fences with great popular support for the Creoles hungered for independence. Finally, three days after forcing the troops under Liniers to retreat, Whitelocke resolved to attack Buenos Aires. Trusting in the superiority of his soldiers, he divided his army into 12 columns and advanced without the protection of the artillery. His army was met on the streets by a mixed-race militia, including 686 African slaves, stiffened by the local 1st Naval Infantry Battalion and 1st &#x27;Patricios&#x27; Infantry Regiment, and fighting continued on the streets of Buenos Aires on 4 July and 5 July. Whitelocke underestimated the importance of urban combat, in which the inhabitants employed cooking pots filled with burning oil and boiling water from rooftops, injuring several soldiers of the 88th Regiment. The locals eventually overwhelmed the British troops. The British suffered 1,000 casualties.

By the end of 5 July 1807, the British controlled Retiro and Residencia at the cost of about 70 officers and 1,000 other ranks killed or wounded, but the city&#x27;s centre was still in the hands of the defenders, and the invaders were now demoralized. At this point, a counter-attack by the militias and colonial troops present, defeated many important British commanders, including Robert Craufurd and Denis Pack. Then Whitelocke proposed a 24-hour truce, which was rejected by Liniers, who ordered an artillery attack.

After suffering 311 killed, 679 wounded and 1,808 captured or missing, Whitelocke signed an armistice with Liniers on 12 August; the local marines playing an important part in defeating Brigadier-General Robert Craufurd and his two thousand troops at the Battle of Plaza del Mercado which is now recalled by the people of Buenos Aires as &#x27;The Defence&#x27;. In the confusion of defeat, many British soldiers deserted their units and more than 50 were returned to the British and were court-martialed, while others were allowed to stay and would form part of the 1,200-strong British contingent that would help in the liberation of Chile.
Whitelocke left the Río de la Plata basin taking with him the British forces in Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and Colonia, but leaving behind 400 seriously wounded. On his return to the United Kingdom, he was court-martialled and cashiered, mainly for surrendering Montevideo. There was much criticism in the British newspapers in the way Whitelocke had conducted himself, and for having surrendered to a largely militia force. Whitelocke would claim that in the 71st Regiment of Foot alone there were 170 deserters. Liniers was later named Viceroy of the Río de la Plata by the Spanish Crown.

According to Uruguayan journalist Juan José de Soiza Reilly, some 3,000 British dead are today buried in a mass grave under passageway Cinco de Julio near Avenida Belgrano in downtown Buenos Aires.

In commemoration of the 1806 victory and, by extension, of the campaign as a whole, 12 August is celebrated in Argentina as the day of the &quot;Reconquista de Buenos Aires&quot;.

==Towards independence==
After having to fight the British invasions by themselves with little direct help from Spain that at the moment was involved in the Napoleonic Wars, the seeds of independence in Argentina were starting to grow among the Criollos. Local militia battalions being commanded mostly by revolutionaries (like Cornelio Saavedra, Manuel Belgrano, Esteban Romero, Juan Martín de Pueyrredón, Juan José Viamonte and Martín Rodriguez) also contributed to the growth of revolutionary zeal. In 1808, Napoleon placed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the throne of Spain giving the chance in 1810 for the May Revolution to take place, as a prelude to the Declaration of Independence of Argentina of 1816.

<doc id="1220097" wikidata="Q5608208" url="?curid=1220097" title="Walter Christaller">
<text>Walter Christaller (21 April 1893 – 9 March 1969) was a German geographer whose principal contribution to the discipline is central place theory, first published in 1933. This groundbreaking theory was the foundation of the study of cities as systems of cities, rather than simple hierarchies or single entities. He was primarily concerned with the urban space and worked on the role of towns as geographic-economic units, besides analyzing the relationships between towns of the same region.

==Life==
Walter Christaller was born to Erdmann Gottreich and Helene Christaller, an author of Christian-themed children&#x27;s novels at Berneck (today part of Altensteig in Germany. His paternal grandfather Johann Gottlieb Christaller was a linguist and a Christian missionary in West Africa.

Before 1914, Christaller began studies in philosophy and political economics and subsequently served in the German Army during World War I. He was homeschooled and educated at the Universities of Heidelberg and Munich. In the 1920s, he pursued a variety of occupations. In 1929, he resumed graduate studies, which led to his famous dissertation on Central Place Theory, which he published as the &quot;Die zentralen Orte in Süddeutschland&quot; (The Central Places in Southern Germany), in 1933.

In the late 1930s, he held a short-lived academic appointment at the University of Freiburg-in-Breisgau. Whether Christaller was a member of the Nazi Party is disputed. He moved into government service, for Himmler&#x27;s SS-Planning and Soil Office, during the Second World War. Christaller&#x27;s task was to draw up plans for reconfiguring the economic geography of Germany&#x27;s eastern conquests (Generalplan Ost), primarily in Czechoslovakia and Poland but also, if successful, Russia itself. Christaller was given special charge of planning occupied Poland, and he did so by using his central place theory as an explicit guide. His work was extended by fellow German August Lösch.

After the war, he joined the Communist Party of Germany and became politically active. In addition, he devoted himself to tourism geography. Since 1950, his Central Place Theory has been used to restructure municipal relationships and boundaries in the Federal Republic of Germany, and the system is still in place today.

In 1950, Christaller, together with Paul Gauss and Emil Meynen, founded the German Association of Applied Geography (DVAG). The Walter Christaller Award for Applied Geography is named after him.

He died in Königstein im Taunus, West Germany, on 9 March 1969.

<doc id="1220101" wikidata="Q6285403" url="?curid=1220101" title="Joseph Maxwell">
<text>Joseph Maxwell, (10 February 1896 – 6 July 1967) was an Australian soldier, writer, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of British and Commonwealth armed forces. Often described as Australia&#x27;s second most decorated soldier of the First World War, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 8 February 1915, and served at Gallipoli before being transferred to the Western Front. In just over twelve months he was commissioned and decorated four times for his bravery.

An apprentice boilermaker before the war, Maxwell returned to Australia in 1919 and worked as a gardener. In 1932, he published &quot;Hell&#x27;s Bells and Mademoiselles&quot;, a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy about his war experiences. Attempting to enlist for service during the Second World War, Maxwell was rejected on the grounds of his age before enlisting under an alias in Queensland; his identity was discovered, and after a short period in a training position, he sought discharge. In 1967, aged 71, he died of a heart attack.

==Early life==
Maxwell was born in the Sydney suburb of Forest Lodge, New South Wales, on 10 February 1896 to John Maxwell, a labourer, and his wife Elizabeth, née Stokes. A member of the Senior Australian Army Cadets for three years, he worked as an apprentice boilermaker at an engineering works near Newcastle upon leaving school. For two years, he served as a member of the Citizens Military Forces, and on 6 February 1915, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force enticed by the prospects of better pay.

==First World War==

===Training, February 1915 to Western Front, May 1917===
Having received his initial training at Liverpool Camp, Maxwell was allotted to &quot;B&quot; Company of the 18th Battalion as a lance corporal, and embarked for Egypt aboard HMAT &quot;Ceramic&quot; on 25 May 1915. The 18th Battalion trained in Egypt from mid-June until mid-August, before proceeding to Gallipoli, where they landed at Anzac Cove on 22 August. The battalion fought its first battle on the same day, staging an attack on the Turkish-held Hill 60. The engagement lasted until 29 August, with half of the battalion becoming casualties, and Maxwell briefly assuming the duties of a stretcher bearer.

Maxwell served on Gallipoli with his unit until 2 December, when he was admitted to 5th Field Ambulance and evacuated from the peninsula suffering from jaundice. Admitted to 3rd Auxiliary Hospital, Heliopolis, he remained there until 11 December, when he was posted to a convalescent camp at Ras el Tin. He rejoined the 18th Battalion on 5 January 1916, which had been evacuated from the Gallipoli Peninsula on 20 December the previous year and posted to Egypt. On 4 February, Maxwell was admitted to the Australian Dermatological Hospital, Abbassia with venereal disease. He returned to his battalion four days before it embarked for France, and the Western Front on 18 March.

Arriving in Marseilles, France, Maxwell was admitted to 7th Australian Field Ambulance and then transferred to the 3rd Canadian General Hospital following wounds sustained during battle. He was moved to the 1st Convalescent Depot on 2 May, and then discharged to Base Details eleven days later. He was later found guilty of breaking ranks at the 07:30 parade on the same day and being absent without leave from 08:00 until 13:00 on 24 May; for this transgression, he was reduced to the ranks. Rejoining his battalion on 1 June, he took part in the Battle of Pozières and received a promotion to sergeant in October.

Suffering synovitis to his right knee, Maxwell was hospitalised for two days and posted to a training battalion in England on 28 November 1916. He stayed there for five months before embarking for France on 9 May 1917 and rejoining the 18th Battalion five days later. Maxwell was only briefly in France before being selected for officer training. Shortly after arriving in England, he attended a boisterous party with a group of soldiers. The military police raided the party and called the local police for assistance after confronting Maxwell&#x27;s group. Maxwell was fined £20 and sent back to his unit for his actions.

===Western Front: May 1917 to August 1918===
Maxwell was again selected for officer training, and on 5 July, he was posted to No. 6 Officers&#x27; Cadet Battalion. He was promoted to company sergeant major on 7 August, before rejoining the 18th Battalion on 11 September. Nine days later, he was engaged in action near Westhoek during the Third Battle of Ypres when he performed the deeds that earned him the Distinguished Conduct Medal. In the battle, the commander of a platoon was killed; Maxwell took command and led it into attack. Noticing that one of the newly captured positions was under heavy fire, Maxwell dashed to it and led the men to a safer and more tactically secure position, thus minimizing casualties.

Commissioned in the field as a second lieutenant on 29 September 1917, Maxwell took part in the engagements around Poelcappelle, Belgium, the following month. He earned promotion to lieutenant on 1 January 1918 and was admitted to the 7th Australian Field Ambulance on 10 January suffering scabies. Having been discharged from the hospital, he rejoined the 18th Battalion on 17 January.

On 8 March 1918, Maxwell commanded a scouting patrol that was operating to the east of Ploegsteert. Having obtained the required information, he ordered the patrol to withdraw. He and three of his men were covering the withdrawal of the main body when he noticed about thirty Germans nearby. Recalling the patrol, he led an attack against the party, which had sheltered in an old trench; the Germans quickly withdrew, leaving three dead and one wounded prisoner of war. Maxwell was awarded the Military Cross for his actions during this engagement, news of which was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 13 May 1918.

Throughout the spring of 1918, the 18th Battalion was involved in operations to repel the German offensive. Maxwell took part in these actions until he was granted leave and went back to England on 17 July. He returned to France and rejoined the 18th Battalion on 1 August, before taking part in the Battle of Amiens where he was to earn a Bar to his Military Cross. On 9 August, the battalion was preparing to attack near Rainecourt. Maxwell took command of the company after all of its other officers became casualties. Under his leadership, the company was able to attack on time, despite being subjected to heavy fire. A tank that preceded the advance immediately became the object of enemy fire and was knocked out by a 77 mm gun. Maxwell, who was in close proximity, rushed over and opened the hatch, allowing the crew to escape. After escorting the tank commander to safety, Maxwell returned to lead the company in the attack, which succeeded in reaching and consolidating their objective. The award of the bar was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 1 February 1919.

===Victoria Cross, October 1918 to repatriation, August 1919===
On 3 October 1918, the 5th Brigade—of which the 18th Battalion was part—became engaged in its last battle of the First World War when breaching the Hindenburg Line close to Beaurevoir and Montbrehain. While taking part in this battle, Maxwell was a member of the attacking party along the Beaurevoir-Fonsomme line when he performed the acts for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Early in the advance, Maxwell&#x27;s company commander was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including all of the officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire, Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans and took another four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company to move through the wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.

Later in the advance, Maxwell learnt from an English-speaking prisoner that a group of Germans in the adjacent post wished to surrender, but were afraid to give themselves up. Accompanied by two privates and the prisoner—who was to act as an interpreter—Maxwell approached the post. The three Australians, however, were immediately surrounded by a group of twenty German soldiers and disarmed. They seemed set to become prisoners themselves, before an artillery barrage fell on the position. Taking advantage of the resulting confusion, Maxwell pulled out a concealed revolver and shot two of the Germans before escaping with his men under heavy rifle fire; one of the privates was subsequently wounded. Organising a party of men, he immediately attacked and captured the post.

The full citation for Maxwell&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 6 January 1919, it read:

The 18th Battalion was training away from the frontline when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. On 8 March 1919, Maxwell was invested with his Victoria Cross by King George V in the ballroom of Buckingham Palace. He headed for Australia on 1 May aboard HT &quot;China&quot;, disembarking at Melbourne on 8 June and proceeding to Sydney, where he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 20 August.

==Later life==
Following demobilisation, Maxwell worked as a gardener in Canberra, Moree and the Maitland district. Having described himself as a reporter, Maxwell married 19-year-old tailoress Mabel Maxwell (unrelated) in a Catholic ceremony at Bellevue Hill, Sydney on 14 February 1921. The marriage produced a daughter, Jean, before being dissolved in 1926 upon Mabel&#x27;s instigation.

On 11 November 1929, Maxwell attended the New South Wales Dinner for recipients of the Victoria Cross in Sydney, and 1932 saw the publication of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Bells and Mademoiselles&quot;, a book written in collaboration with Hugh Buggy about his experiences in the war. At the time, Maxwell was working as a gardener with the Department of the Interior in Canberra. The book was a success, but Maxwell soon spent what money he made from it. In the late 1930s, he wrote the manuscript for a second book entitled &quot;From the Hindenburg Line to the Breadline&quot;. The book was never published and the manuscript was lost when it was lent to someone to read.

In 1933, Maxwell acted as a defence witness in the trial of Alfred Jamieson, who was accused of housebreaking. Maxwell was Jamieson&#x27;s former platoon commander and testified that Jamieson had been of good character but had been strongly affected by the war.

After the outbreak of the Second World War, Maxwell made several attempts to enlist, but was unsuccessful due to his age, and deteriorating health. He eventually travelled to Queensland, where he enlisted under the alias of Joseph Wells on 27 June 1940. However, his identity was soon discovered and he was given a training position; dissatisfied, he took his discharge on 9 September 1940.

In 1952, Maxwell joined the contingent of Victoria Cross recipients invited to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. On 6 March 1956, describing himself as a journalist from Bondi, Maxwell married widow Anne Martin, née Burton, in Sydney. Three years later, he attended the Victoria Cross centenary celebrations in London, before later re-visiting the battlefields in France. In 1964, together with his wife, Maxwell attended the opening of the VC Corner in the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. He was determined that his Victoria Cross would not wind up in the collection, believing that the award would be devalued by &quot;lumping&quot; them together.

On 6 July 1967, Maxwell collapsed and died of a heart attack in a street in his home town Matraville, New South Wales. He had been an invalid pensioner for some time. His funeral service took place with full military honours at St Mathias Anglican Church, Paddington. Having been cremated, his ashes were interred at the Eastern Suburbs Crematorium in Botany. Anne Maxwell presented her husband&#x27;s medals to the Army Museum of New South Wales at Victoria Barracks, Paddington, and subsequently the medals, together with a portrait and a brass copy of his VC citation, were unveiled by the Minister of Defence, Allan Fairhall. In 2003, Maxwell&#x27;s medals were presented to the Australian War Memorial on a permanent loan basis.

<text>John Paton VC (23 December 1833 – 1 April 1914) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.
==Details==
Paton was 23 years old, and a sergeant in the 93rd Regiment of Foot (later The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place at the Siege of Lucknow for which he was awarded the VC:
 He was celebrated as &quot;The Hero of Lucknow&quot;.

He described the Battle of Lucknow to a journalist in 1907, &quot;There were only 2,500 on our side and it was estimated that the enemy numbered over 70,000 sepoys and mark you they were not savages but well trained soldiers armed and drilled the same as we were.&quot;

He emigrated to Australia in 1861 becoming a prison governor.
He lived with his family in a cottage (no longer standing) near the corner of Prospect Road and Robert Street at Summer Hill in Sydney&#x27;s inner western suburbs. He worshipped at St. Andrews Anglican Church on the corner of Henson and Smith Streets, Summer Hill. A magnificent bronze memorial was erected in his memory by his sisters and is located on the wall to the immediate left upon entering the church main entrance. A park located across the street from the church is named in his honour His grave (including family members) is in the Anglican Monumental Area &quot;AAA, number 414&quot; of Rookwood Necropolis, Strathfield, Sydney. This impressive monumental grave was completely refurbished in mid-2013 by the Office of Australian War Graves, whose duty includes maintaining in perpetuity the graves of all VC Heroes buried in Australia.

He died at his home on the 1st of April 1914 aged 81. After a memorial service at St Andrews Church his flag draped coffin was conveyed by a military honour guard to Summer Hill Railway Station on a horse drawn gun carriage, the bells of St Andrews tolling as locals lined the streets to pay their respect. The coffin was loaded on a funeral train and taken to Rookwood Cemetery, where he was buried with full military honours.

Never one to romanticise war he later said, &quot;The scenes of horror at the final relief of Lucknow I cannot even now dwell upon. Our joy at reunion with our comrades and the safety of the woman and children, turned us into hysterical woman&quot;. Although honored throughout his life to have won the Victoria Cross he wasn&#x27;t overtly sentimental about it, telling a journalist, &quot;The much vaunted V.C. carries with it a pension of £10 per annum. Now it must be remembered that men who got the V.C. are generally pretty badly broken up in achieving it. I was not, but most of those gaining it have been left minus a leg or an arm, or have been in some way incapacitated. £10 a year seems but a paltry sum to recompense men so badly smashed. My complaint is not a personal one, as I have explained I came through without a scratch.&quot;

==The medal ==

His Victoria Cross was originally donated to St Andrews Church of England, Summer Hill, by his daughters and for years it was proudly displayed with his other medals in a cabinet directly beneath his large bronze memorial plaque, however after it was stolen in the early 1980s and recovered soon afterwards with a subsequent attempt at theft the church decided to honour John Paton&#x27;s memory by donating it to his old regiment in the town of his birth.

His valour under fire winning him the admiration of his regiment, non-commissioned officers nominating him for the VC, one of six soldiers at the Battle of Lucknow to win one, bestowed by Queen Victoria at a ceremony in England. He also received campaign medals for bravery, including: &#x27;Relief of Lucknow (1857–1858)&#x27; - &#x27;Crimea (1855)&#x27; and one for &#x27;Sevastopol, Balaklava and Alma (1854)&#x27;

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Museum, Stirling Castle, Scotland.

<text>Johann Andreas Herbst (baptized June 9, 1588 – January 24, 1666) was a German composer and music theorist of the early Baroque era. He was a contemporary of Michael Praetorius and Heinrich Schütz, and like them, assisted in importing the grand Venetian style and the other features of the early Baroque into Protestant Germany.

== Life ==
He was born at Nuremberg, and most likely had his early education there. Possibly he studied with Hans Leo Hassler, one of the most prominent German composers at the turn of the century, since Hassler was teaching in Nuremberg while Herbst was a student, and there is a close stylistic relationship between the music of the two composers. Herbst became &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; at Butzbach in 1614, at Darmstadt in 1618, and at Frankfurt am Main in 1623.

In 1636 he accepted a position in Nuremberg, and returned to the city of his birth; it was evidently a frustrating appointment for him, for he wrote of his time there bitterly, and in 1644 he went back to Frankfurt, where he remained for the rest of his life. His most productive time was the period in Nuremberg and the second Frankfurt employment, during which he wrote his theoretical treatises and composed the bulk of his church music.

== Writings ==
Herbst was one of the most important German music theorists of the first half of the 17th century, second only to Michael Praetorius. Herbst&#x27;s two books, &quot;Musica practica&quot; and &quot;Musica poetica&quot;, were hugely influential: except for the titles, they were in German, and covered many topics of practical importance to musicians. &quot;Musica practica&quot; was a manual on the art of singing, with particular care given to explaining the art of tasteful ornamentation; &quot;Musica poetica&quot; was a manual on the art of composition, and included exercises in counterpoint and in the careful setting of text to music. Parts of the first book, &quot;Musica practica&quot;, were drawn from the earlier treatise of Michael Praetorius, the &quot;Syntagma musicum.&quot;

Late in his career he published several translations of Latin musical writings in German, under the collected title of &quot;Arte prattica &amp; poetica.&quot;

== Musical style and influence ==
Herbst wrote cantatas, chorales, chorale concertos, motets, psalm settings, and numerous other works, most of which were on sacred topics, and none of which were exclusively instrumental.

Some of his music uses the massive Venetian polychoral style, especially that written before the Thirty Years&#x27; War. During the war it became more and more difficult to find and employ the large numbers of musicians necessary for pieces in this style, and this trend towards simplification of instrumental forces can be seen in his music as well as that of his contemporaries.

His books of motets and his &quot;Teatrum amoris&quot; (meant to be in imitation of the Italian madrigal) avoid the continuo style then dominant in Italy, but otherwise Herbst uses many of the new Baroque era techniques which composers such as Hassler and Schütz brought back across the Alps from Venice. The concertato style, with mixed groups of instruments and voices, is well-developed in Herbst&#x27;s earlier music. The monodic style which was popular in Italy, and evident in the music of Schütz, along with its descendant, the recitative, is nowhere to be found in Herbst.

One of his last, and simplest, books of music is a collection of 29 chorales for five voices, which he published in 1659.

<text>Sir Owen Edward Pennefather Lloyd (1 January 1854 – 5 July 1941) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Lloyd was born in County Roscommon and educated at Fermoy College and Queen&#x27;s University, Cork (now University College Cork).

<text>Frederick William Palmer (11 November 1891 – 10 September 1955) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 20 years old, and a Lance-Sergeant in the 22nd Battalion, The Royal Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16/17 February 1917 north of Courcelette, France, Lance-Sergeant Palmer assumed command of his company when all his officers had become casualties. Having cut his way under point-blank fire, through wire entanglements, he dislodged an enemy machine-gun and established a &quot;block&quot;. He then collected some other men and held the barricade for nearly three hours against seven determined counter-attacks. While he was fetching more bombs an eighth counter-attack was delivered, threatening the advance of the whole flank. At this critical moment, although suffering from extreme exhaustion, he rallied his men, drove back the enemy and maintained his position.

He later achieved the rank of Second Lieutenant. When his battalion was disbanded, he joined the RFC as an observer.

After the war, he went to Malaya, where he set up in business. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he returned to England in 1940, arriving just in time for the Battle of Britain, and re-joined the Royal Air Force. He achieved the rank of Wing-Commander, and was mentioned in dispatches at the end of the war. He then returned to Malaya.

He retired to the south of England in 1950.

<doc id="1220121" wikidata="Q6838344" url="?curid=1220121" title="Mick Moon">
<text>Rupert Theo Vance &quot;Mick&quot; Moon (14 August 1892 – 28 February 1986) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and First World War==
Moon was born at Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, on 14 August 1892. He was the son of Mr and Mrs Arthur Moon of Kinaird, Toorak, Victoria. When he left school he worked for the National Bank of Australasia and was at the Maffra branch when World War I began in the summer of 1914. He was 24 years old, and a lieutenant in the 58th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

At 2.30pm on 11 May 1917 Major C. Denehy, acting OC 58th Battalion (58/Bn), called his officers to a headquarters conference to discuss the three Bullecourt, France, objectives given to them by Brig-Gen. Harold Elliott: ‘A’ Coy - a concrete machine gun nest; ‘B’ Coy - the German trench and dugouts; and ‘C’ Coy - securing the crossroads and beyond.

Lieutenant R. V. Moon was a 24-year-old bank clerk who, as a 4th Light Horse NCO had transferred to 58/Bn after Fromelles. His ‘A’ Coy platoon, of 28 men and two Lewis guns, were given the difficult task of taking the concrete machine-gun nest facing the Australians. 

On 12 May 1917, during the hours leading-up to zero the Germans unleashed a terrific bombardment, which Elliot described as the worst he had ever been under. Prospects for success diminished particularly when only one of the three section of Stokes guns was left in action.

With Moon flinging bombs, he led his platoon towards their objectives in the face of fierce resistance. Despite a severe facial wound, Moon kept rallying his dwindling numbers. Inspired by his leadership, his platoon took control of the strongpoint. Moon then led his men towards ‘B’ Coy’s objective, who were struggling against German reinforcements emerging from a nearby dugout system. When some of his platoon wavered, Moon, despite a second wound that left him dazed and deafened, waved his swagger stick and called encouragement.

Moon’s decisive leadership tipped the balance. He positioned one of his Lewis Gun to enfilade the German trench and the superior number of retreating defenders. Those that retreated to their dugout were trapped by Moon rushing to the dugout entrance and firing inside.

Though the Australians were successful the British advance on Moon’s left, had been less so, making the 58/Bn’s third objective impossible in daylight. Moon was hit again, but because of the situation on the left, refused to leave the field. After sitting down for a brief rest he convened a conference with two other 58/Bn lieutenants. In the process of reorganising the remaining troops, Moon was hit again – his jaw was broken and twelve teeth were shattered. It was not until the new position was secure that Moon was assisted to the rear. After nightfall, the Australians took control of the vital crossroads to complete the difficult assignment. Three hundred yards of the Hindenburg Line and its strongpoints had been taken: five machine-guns, three flame-throwers, two bomb-throwing machines, and 186 prisoners, mostly trapped by Moon and fifteen or so of his platoon, had been captured.

In Elliott’s account of the battle, &#x27;Mickey&#x27; Moon monopolised the superlatives. Once he had doubted if Moon had the makings of an officer, but carrying on with his jaw broken and three other wounds as well was exceptional gallantry, and Elliott submitted his name for the VC. Moon was the only member of the 15th Brigade to be awarded the VC. The citation for his VC appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in June 1917 and reads as follows:

Moon, who later reached the rank of captain, received his VC from King George V at an investiture at Buckingham Palace in August, having by then recovered from his wounds. The medal is now displayed at the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.

==Post-war and later life==
During the Federal elections of 1919, Brigadier-General &quot;Pompey&quot; Elliott engaged Moon as his election campaign &quot;secretary&quot;. At the time Moon, who was unemployed and finding it difficult to adjust to civilian life, appreciated the offer of employment. Elliott calculated that his fame, together with a VC winner, would do his campaign in country Victoria, no harm. Together they were enthusiastically received, particularly by the returned AIF.

After working for Elliott, Moon, being unsettled and fighting nervous reactions to his war experiences, left Australia to settle in Malaya as a rubber planter.

After he returned from the war he resumed working for the National Bank in Geelong, a position he held until he took up a senior position with Dennys Lascelles Ltd. On 17 December 1931 he married Sammy Vincent at St George&#x27;s Church Geelong.

He lived at Calder Park, Mount Duneed, from 1954 to 1978. He died at his home at Barwon Heads on 28 February 1986 and was buried in the Anglican section of Mount Duneed Cemetery.

==Legacy==

In 1918 an avenue of honour was created linking Bacchus Marsh to the Western Highway. Constructed from elm trees, the avenue was planted to commemorate soldiers from Bacchus Marsh who served in the First World War. The 164th tree in the avenue was planted and dedicated to Moon. In recent years, Moon Reserve was unveiled at the beginning of the Avenue of Honour in honour of Rupert Vance Moon. In 2010, the Avenue of Honour was nominated to be placed on the National Heritage list.

On 12 May 2008, the Rupert Vance Moon V.C. Memorial Garden was unveiled at the Mount Duneed Cemetery, with a large crowd in attendance, including Moon&#x27;s descendants, representatives from the Returned and Services League of Australia, and past and present soldiers.

<doc id="1220125" wikidata="Q879981" url="?curid=1220125" title="Black Swan-class sloop">
<text>The &quot;Black Swan&quot; class and Modified &quot;Black Swan&quot; class were two classes of sloop of the Royal Navy and Royal Indian Navy. Twelve &quot;Black Swan&quot;s were launched between 1939 and 1943, including four for the Royal Indian Navy; twenty-five Modified &quot;Black Swan&quot;s were launched between 1942 and 1945, including two for the Royal Indian Navy; several other ships were cancelled.

==History==
Like corvettes, sloops of that period were specialised convoy-defence vessels. Corvettes were based on a mercantile design with triple expansion engines, sloops were conventional naval vessels with turbines. Sloops were larger and faster with a heavy armament of high angle 4-inch guns which had superior anti-aircraft fire control via the Fuze Keeping Clock, while retaining excellent anti-submarine capability. They were designed to have a longer range than a destroyer at the expense of a lower top speed, while remaining capable of outrunning surfaced Type VII and Type IX U-boats.

In World War II, &quot;Black Swan&quot;-class sloops sank 29 U-boats. The most famous sloop commander was Captain Frederic John Walker. His sloop became one of the most successful submarine hunters, taking part in the sinking of eleven U-boats. After the war, sloops continued in service with the Royal Navy, Egyptian Navy, Indian Navy, Pakistan Navy and the West German Navy. In April 1949, was attacked on the Yangtze River by the Communist People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Several &quot;Black Swan&quot; sloops fought in the Korean War.

==&quot;Black Swan&quot; class==

===Royal Navy===
The first two ships were built under the 1937 Programme, being ordered from Yarrow and Company, Scotstoun, on 1 January 1938. The second pair was built under the 1939 Programme, being ordered from Furness Shipbuilding Company on 21 June 1939. A further ten RN ships were ordered under the 1940 War Programme on 13 April 1940; however six of these (the orders placed with White of Cowes, Thornycroft at Woolston, and Swan Hunter on Tyneside for two ships each) were subsequently replaced by orders for an equal number of escort destroyers.

There were incremental improvements as the building developed, and the &quot;Woodcock&quot; and &quot;Wren&quot; when completed were practically indistinguishable from the Modified &quot;Black Swan&quot; class.

===Royal Indian Navy===
Two ships were ordered under the 1939 Programme, the order being placed with Denny on 8 September 1939. The second pair were ordered under the 1940 Programme, this order with Thornycroft being placed on 29 August 1940. The first two were used as survey ships after the War. The second pair were transferred to the Pakistan Navy in 1948. The third pair (which were of the Modified &quot;Black Swan&quot; class – see below)

==Modified &quot;Black Swan&quot; class==

===Royal Navy===
Fourteen sloops for the RN were in the 1940 Supplementary War Programme. The first two were ordered from Denny, Dunbarton, on 9 January 1941, ten more were ordered on 27 March 1941 (two each from Cammell Laird, Scotts, Thornycroft, Yarrow and John Brown), and a final pair from Fairfield, Govan, on 18 July 1941. The contract with John Brown was transferred to Devonport Dockyard on 3 March 1942, and then to Denny on 8 December 1942.

Another fourteen ships were authorised in the 1941 Programme, but the last three ships (the names &quot;Star&quot;, &quot;Steady&quot; and &quot;Trial&quot; had been approved) were not ordered under this programme. The first of the eleven actually ordered was contracted with Thornycroft on 3 December 1941, with a further pair from Stephens, Linthouse, on 18 December. Eight more were ordered in 1942, two on 11 February, two on 3 March (originally from Portsmouth Dockyard), two on 12 August and two on 5 October. However the order for two sloops were ordered at Portsmouth was moved to Chatham Dockyard on 21 June 1943, and they were laid down there, but were cancelled on 15 October 1945.

Two more sloops were authorised in the 1942 Programme; the names would have been &quot;Waterhen&quot; and &quot;Wryneck&quot; but they were never ordered in that year&#x27;s Programme. The 1944 Programme re-instated these two vessels, as well as the twelfth sloop authorised under the 1941 Programme, and now named as &quot;Partridge&quot;. These three ships were ordered on 9 October 1944, but they were all cancelled on 15 October 1945. These had been intended to be further modified and enlarged, with a beam of . Two further ships planned under the 1944 Programme would have been named &quot;Woodpecker&quot; (ii) and &quot;Wild Swan&quot;, but these were never ordered and the intention to build was dropped when the 1945 Programme was compiled.

* &quot;U-482&quot; was credited during the war to the &quot;Starling&quot;, along with the sloops , , , and frigate , as having been sunk in the North Channel on 16 January 1945. The Admiralty withdrew this credit in a post-war reassessment in the 1990s.

<text>T.C. Hsu (; 17 April 1917 – 9 July 2003), was a Chinese American cell biologist. He was the 13th president of American Society for Cell Biology, and known as the &quot;Father of Mammalian Cytogenetics&quot;.

== Life ==
Hsu was born Hsu Tao-Chiuh in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, China. He did his undergraduate and postgraduate studies in the College of Agricultural Sciences, Zhejiang University. 1948, he went to USA, and obtained PhD from the University of Texas at Austin in 1951. Hsu worked in the laboratory of Charles Pomerat at the University of Texas Medical Branch during the early 1950s.

Since the turn of the twentieth century, chromosomes prepared on microscope slides formed clumps that made it extremely difficult to distinguish them. Although the preparations made the identification of individual chromosomes difficult, by the 1920s, cytologists consistently reported a diploid number of 48 human chromosomes. In April 1952, Hsu discovered a technique—the hypotonic solution—that separated the clumped chromosomes, thereby allowing him to observe each one individually Even though he now could distinguish human chromosomes to a much greater degree than his predecessors, Hsu still reported a diploid number of 48 human chromosomes (see Figure 14 in his 1952 paper). The correct diploid chromosome number of 46 human chromosomes was first reported three years later by Joe Hin Tjio and Albert Levan.

Bryan Sykes describes Hsu and the diploid chromosome number in his book &quot;Adam&#x27;s Curse&quot;.

Hsu was president of the American Society for Cell Biology and served on the faculty at M.D. Anderson for more than 30 years. He was a UTMB GSBS Distinguished Alumnus Award recipient in 1996. He is also a recipient of The International Center in New York&#x27;s Award of Excellence.

His autobiography was published in the &quot;American Journal of Medical Genetics&quot; 59:304-325 (1995).

He died in Houston, Texas, USA.

<text>Robert Anthony Maurice Palmer, (7 July 1920 – 23 December 1944) was a bomber pilot in the Royal Air Force and a posthumous English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of British and Commonwealth forces. His award was the result of his valour during the Allied action over Germany during the Second World War.

==Early life==
The son of Arthur Palmer and Lillian (&quot;née&quot; Skuse), Palmer was born on 7 July 1920 at Gillingham, Kent. He was educated at Gravesend Grammar School (where a portrait in his memory and his Victoria Cross citation now hang in the school hall), before being commissioned in the RAF.

==Military career==
Palmer first flew in operations during the Second World War in January 1941 and took part in the first 1,000-bomber raid against Cologne in 1942. He was one of the first pilots to drop a 4,000-lb. &#x27;Cookie&#x27; bomb. In 1943 he served with 20 OTU at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland.

By the end of 1944, Palmer had completed 110 bombing missions, many with the Pathfinder Force necessitating deep penetration of enemy territory and low-level &#x27;marking&#x27; operations against heavily defended targets.

At 24 years old, as a squadron leader serving with No. 109 Squadron (RAF), he embarked on what was to be his final mission, for which he received the VC. On 23 December 1944 over Cologne, Germany, Palmer was leading a formation of Lancaster bombers on a daylight raid to bomb Cologne&#x27;s Gremberg railway marshalling yards. His Lancaster PB371 was designated Master Bomber and using Oboe radio bombing equipment his orders were to mark the targets for the other heavy bombers to aim for.

Palmer was in command of one of 27 Lancasters accompanied by three Mosquitoes from No. 8 Group to attack the Gremberg railway yards. The air raid went badly. The force was split into three formations, each led by an Oboe-equipped Lancaster with an Oboe-equipped Mosquito in reserve. During the outward flight, two Lancasters collided over the French coast with the loss of both crews. On approaching their target over German airspace, they found that the forecasted cloud cover had cleared, leaving them exposed during the long straight approach and vulnerable to Cologne&#x27;s AA defences. It was thus decided to allow the bombers to break formation and bomb visually.

The order to abandon the Oboe run did not reach Palmer, who continued with his designated role despite his aircraft having already been damaged by Wehrmacht flak cannon. Some minutes before reaching the target two of his engines caught fire, but rejecting alternative evasive action and being determined to provide an accurate and easily visible aiming point for the other bombers, he managed to keep the badly damaged aircraft on a straight course, made a perfect approach and released his bombs. His Lancaster was last seen spiralling to earth in flames and only one member of his crew, the rear gunner, escaped with his life.

The squadron lost a Lancaster and a Mosquito shot down by German flak artillery and Luftwaffe fighters, with a further Lancaster abandoned by its crew over Belgium; the losses totalled six aircraft out of the 30 dispatched.

Palmer is buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Rheinberg War Cemetery in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The inscription on his gravestone reads: , a quote from &#x27;An Irish Airman Foresees His Death&#x27; (1918) by W. B. Yeats.

<text>James Ernest Newland, VC (22 August 1881 – 19 March 1949) was an Australian soldier, policeman and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Newland was awarded the Victoria Cross following three separate actions in April 1917, during attacks against German forces retreating to the Hindenburg Line. While in command of a company, Newland successfully led his men in several assaults on German positions and repulsed subsequent counter-attacks.

Born in the Victorian town of Highton, Newland joined the Australian military in 1899 and saw active service during the Second Boer War. He continued to serve in the Australian Army&#x27;s permanent forces on his return to Australia, and completed several years&#x27; service in the artillery. Transferring to the militia in 1907, Newland became a police officer in Tasmania before re-joining the permanent forces in 1910. After the outbreak of the First World War, he was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force and was among the first wave of men to land at Gallipoli. In the following days, Newland was wounded and evacuated to Egypt where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.

Transferring to the Western Front in 1916, Newland was mentioned in despatches for his leadership while commanding a company during an attack at Mouquet Farm. He was wounded twice more during the war and medically discharged in March 1918; he returned to service with the permanent army. Newland held several appointments between the two world wars, and retired a lieutenant colonel in 1941. He died of heart failure in 1949.

==Early life==
Newland was born in the Geelong suburb of Highton, Victoria, on 22 August 1881 to William Newland, a labourer, and his wife Louisa Jane (née Wall). In 1899, he enlisted in the Commonwealth Military Forces and was assigned to the 4th Battalion, Australian Commonwealth Horse, as a private. The unit later embarked for South Africa, where Newland saw active service in Cape Town during the Second Boer War.

Returning to Australia in 1902, Newland re-settled in Victoria and joined the Royal Australian Artillery in July the following year. He served in the artillery for over four years, before transferring to the militia in September 1907. In 1909, he became a police officer in the Tasmanian Police Force, where he remained until August 1910, when he re-enlisted in the permanent army. He was posted to the Australian Instructional Corps; he served with this unit until the outbreak of the First World War. In a ceremony at Sheffield, Tasmania, on 27 December 1913, Newland married Florence May Mitchell.

==First World War==
On 17 August 1914, Newland transferred to the newly raised Australian Imperial Force following the British Empire&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany and her allies. Assigned to the 12th Battalion, he was made its regimental quartermaster sergeant and embarked from Hobart aboard HMAT &quot;Geelong&quot; on 20 October, bound for Egypt. After a brief stop in Western Australia, the troopship arrived at its destination seven weeks later. The 12th Battalion spent the next four months training in the Egyptian desert.

At the commencement of the Gallipoli Campaign, the 3rd Australian Brigade—of which the 12th Battalion was part—was designated as the covering force for the ANZAC landing, and as such was the first unit ashore on 25 April 1915, at approximately 04:30. Newland was wounded in the days following the landing, suffering a gunshot wound to his arm, and was evacuated to the 1st General Hospital. While at the hospital, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 22 May, before returning to the 12th Battalion four days later.

Newland was engaged in operations on the Gallipoli Peninsula until 9 June, when he was withdrawn from the area and placed in command of the 12th Battalion&#x27;s transport elements stationed in Egypt. Promoted to lieutenant on 15 October, he was hospitalised for ten days in November due to dengue fever. Following the Allied evacuation of Gallipoli in December, the 12th Battalion returned to Egypt where Newland continued as transport officer. Promoted to captain on 1 March 1916, he was made adjutant of the 12th Battalion fifteen days later. It embarked for France and the Western Front later that month.

Disembarking at Marseilles, the 12th Battalion was initially posted to the Fleurbaix sector of France. After involvement in minor operations, it transferred to the Somme in July, where it participated in the Battle of Pozières, its first major French action. Newland was posted to command A Company from 8 August, and was subsequently moved to Sausage Valley along with the rest of the 12th Battalion in preparation for an attack on Mouquet Farm.

Mouquet Farm was a ruined complex connected to several German strongpoints, and formed part of the Thiepval defences. On 21 August, Newland led his company in an assault on a series of trenches slightly north east of the farm. By 18:30, the company had captured its objectives and several of Newland&#x27;s men rushed off in pursuit of the retreating Germans. Newland immediately stopped them and organised the company into a defensive position; the trench was consolidated by 05:00 the next morning. Praised for his &quot;... great coolness and courage under heavy fire&quot; during the attack, he was recommended for the Military Cross. The award was downgraded to a mention in despatches, the announcement of which was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 4 January 1917.

After its involvement at Pozières and Mouquet Farm, the 12th Battalion was briefly transferred to the Ypres sector in Belgium in September, before returning to Bernafay Wood on the Somme late the following month. Newland was admitted to the 38th Casualty Clearing Station with pyrexia on 4 December. He was moved to the 2nd General Hospital at Le Havre, and returned to the 12th Battalion two weeks later following recuperation. On the same day, he was attached to the headquarters of the 2nd Australian Brigade for duty as a staff officer. He was granted leave on 21 January 1917 on completion of this stint.

Re-joining the 12th Battalion, Newland once again assumed command of A Company. On 26 February 1917, he was tasked with leading it during the 12th Battalion&#x27;s attack on the village of La Barque during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. At Bark Trench, a position on the north side of the centre of La Barque, the company encountered a German strongpoint and Newland received a gunshot wound to the face. He was admitted to the 1st Australian Field Ambulance, and returned to the 12th Battalion on 25 March after a period of hospitalisation at the 7th Stationary Hospital in Boulogne.

===Victoria Cross===
By early April 1917, there remained three German-held outpost villages—Boursies, Demicourt and Hermies—between the area to the south of the I Anzac Corps position and the Hindenburg Line. An attack by the 1st Australian Division to capture them was planned for 9 April, the same day the British offensive opened at Arras. For his actions on three separate occasions during the assault, Newland was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On the night of 7/8 April, the 12th Battalion was tasked with the capture of Boursies, on the Bapaume–Cambrai road. The attack was a feint to mislead the German forces on the direction from which Hermies was to be assaulted. Leading A Company as well as an attached platoon from B Company, Newland began his advance on the village at 03:00. The company was soon subject to heavy rifle and machine gun fire from a derelict mill approximately short of the village, and began to suffer heavy casualties. Rallying his men, Newland charged the position and bombed the Germans with grenades. The attack dislodged the Germans, and the company secured the area and continued its advance.

Throughout 8 April, the Australians were subjected to heavy shellfire from German forces. At approximately 22:00, the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack under the cover of a barrage of bombs and trench mortars against A Company&#x27;s position at the mill. They had some initial success and entered the forward posts of the mill, which were occupied by a platoon of Newland&#x27;s men under the command of Sergeant John Whittle. Newland, bringing up a platoon from the battalion&#x27;s reserve company, charged the attackers and re-established the lost ground with Whittle&#x27;s assistance. The 12th Battalion was relieved by the 11th Battalion on 10 April, having succeeded in capturing Boursies at the cost of 240 casualties, of which 70 were killed or missing.

After a four-day reprieve from the frontline, the 12th Battalion relieved the 9th Battalion at Lagnicourt on 14 April. Around dawn the next day, the Germans launched a severe counter-attack against the 1st Australian Division&#x27;s line. Breaking through, they forced back the 12th Battalion&#x27;s D Company, which was to the right of Newland&#x27;s A Company. Soon surrounded and under attack on three sides, Newland withdrew the company to a sunken road which had been held by Captain Percy Cherry during the capture of the village three weeks earlier, and lined the depleted company out in a defensive position on each bank.

The German forces attacked Newland&#x27;s company several times during the battle, but were repulsed each time. During one of the assaults, Newland observed that the German attack was weakening and gathered a party of twenty men. Leading the group, he charged the Germans and seized forty as prisoners. As reinforcements from the 9th Battalion began to arrive, a combined counter-attack was launched and the line recaptured by approximately 11:00. During the engagement, the 12th Battalion suffered 125 casualties, including 66 killed or missing. Newland and Whittle were both awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions at Boursies and Lagnicourt; they were the only two permanent members of the Australian military to receive the decoration during the war. At 35 years and 7 months old, Newland was also the oldest Australian Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War.

The full citation for Newland&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 8 June 1917:

===Later war service===
In early May 1917, the 12th Battalion was involved in the British and Australian attempt to capture the village of Bullecourt. While engaged in this operation on 6 May, Newland was wounded for the third and final time of the war by a gunshot to his left armpit. Initially admitted to the 5th Field Ambulance, he was transferred to No 1 Red Cross Hospital, Le Touquet, the next day. The injury necessitated treatment in England, and Newland was shipped to a British hospital eight days later.

On recovering from his wounds, Newland attended an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 21 July, where he was decorated with his Victoria Cross by King George V. Later the same day, Newland boarded a ship to Australia. It arrived in Melbourne on 18 September, and Newland travelled to Tasmania. He was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force as medically unfit on 2 March 1918.

==Later life==

Following his discharge, Newland retained the rank of captain and returned to service with the permanent military forces. Between the two world wars, he held several appointments in the army, including adjutant and quartermaster of the 8th, 49th, 52nd, 38th and 12th Battalions, as well as area officer and recruiting officer. In 1924, Newland&#x27;s wife Florence died of tuberculosis. On 30 April 1925, he married Heather Vivienne Broughton in a ceremony at St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church, Bendigo; the couple would later have a daughter. Promoted to major on 1 May 1930, Newland was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1935.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, Newland was seconded for duties as quartermaster instructor at the 4th Division headquarters. On 10 May 1940, he assumed his final army appointment as quartermaster, A Branch, at Army Headquarters in Melbourne. He served in this position until August 1941, when he was placed on the retired list with the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel.

In retirement, Newland served as Assistant Commissioner of the Australian Red Cross Society in the Northern Territory during the later months of 1941. He joined the inspection staff at the Ammunition Factory in Footscray on 2 January 1942. At his home in Caulfield, Victoria, on 19 March 1949, he died suddenly of heart failure at the age of 67. He was accorded a funeral with full military honours, and was buried at Brighton Cemetery. In 1984, Newland&#x27;s daughter, Dawn, donated her father&#x27;s medals to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where they currently reside.

<text>The perichondrium (from Greek and ) is a layer of dense irregular connective tissue that surrounds the cartilage of developing bone. It consists of two separate layers: an outer fibrous layer and inner chondrogenic layer. The fibrous layer contains fibroblasts, which produce collagenous fibres. The chondrogenic layer remains undifferentiated and can form chondroblasts. Perichondrium can be found around the perimeter of elastic cartilage and hyaline cartilage.

Perichondrium is a type of irregular collagenous ordinary connective tissue, and also functions in the growth and repair of cartilage. Perichondrium contains type I collagen and type XII collagen.

<text>Captain James Dalgleish Pollock, (3 June 1890 – 10 May 1958) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Pollock was 25 years old, and a corporal in the 5th Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders during the First World War when the following deed took place at the Battle of Loos, for which he was awarded the VC.:

==Further information==
He was commissioned into the Cameron Highlanders in 1916 and left the Army in 1919 with the rank of Captain.

James Pollock gained the VC for his outstanding bravery in saving his comrades in the Big Willie trench when it was infiltrated by German bombers. Just over two weeks later his second cousin, James Lennox Dawson also won the VC in the same trenches at the same battle. His actions were remarkably similar. Dawson saved his colleagues in the trench by going over the top, under machine-gun fire, to roll away gas canisters that had been blown open by German shells. Both men were 25 years of age and born within six months of each other in the small Scottish town of Tillicoultry. Both were feted back in Scotland and given the equivalent of a civic reception, James Pollock in Tillicoultry and James Dawson in Alloa, barely a week apart in December 1915.

==Royal Observer Corps==
Pollock volunteered for service the Royal Observer Corps during World War II. He is recorded as being an Observer Officer and full-time Duty Controller in No 33 Aberdeen (Ayr) Group. As far as is known, he was the only ROC Officer in history of the Corps to hold the Victoria Cross. Along with other members of No 33 Group James Pollock stood down on or before 12 May 1945.

To mark the end of the Second World War the Air Ministry arranged a huge rally at RAF North Weald in Essex from Saturday 23 June to Monday 25 June 1945. Almost 2,000 members of the ROC from all over the United Kingdom were invited to attend the rally. King George VI had already approved the design of an Ensign for the newly formed Royal Observer Corps, the Ensign was RAF blue with the Union Jack in one corner and also bearing the Corps&#x27; crest. It was dedicated at a special service held at North Weald on Sunday 24 June 1945. That day the 2,000 observers carried out the first ever uniformed ROC march past to the accompaniment of the RAF Band with the Under Secretary of State for Air, Lord Beatty, taking the salute. The parade then formed into a huge square and the Royal Observer Corps Ensign was presented by Lord Beatty. The Ensign was borne to the drumhead by Observer Lieutenant Pollock VC. In the parade Observer Lieutenant Pollock bore the Ensign flanked by two senior NCO’s at the head of the massed contingent of observers. A filmed record of the day&#x27;s events is held in the National Archive at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==The medal==

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of Queens Own Highlanders, (Fort George, Inverness-shire, Scotland).

<text>Chan Chan (), sometimes itself called Chimor, was the capital city of the Chimor kingdom. It was the largest city of the pre-Columbian era in South America. It is now an archeological site in the department of La Libertad west of Trujillo, Peru.

Chan Chan is located in the mouth of the Moche Valley and was the capital of the historical empire of the Chimor from 900 to 1470, when they were defeated and incorporated into the Inca Empire. Chimor, a conquest state, developed from the Chimú culture which established itself along the Peruvian coast around 900 CE.

Chan Chan is in a particularly arid section of the coastal desert of northern Peru. Due to the lack of rain in this area, the major source of nonsalted water for Chan Chan is in the form of rivers carrying surface runoff from the Andes. This runoff allows for control of land and water through irrigation systems.

The city of Chan Chan spanned and had a dense urban center of which contained extravagant &quot;ciudadelas&quot;. &quot;Ciudadelas&quot; were large architectural masterpieces which housed plazas, storerooms, and burial platforms for the royals. The splendor of these &quot;ciudadelas&quot; suggests their association with the royal class. Housing for the lower classes of Chan Chan&#x27;s hierarchical society are known as small, irregular agglutinated rooms (SIARs). Because the lower classes were often artisans whose role in the empire was to produce crafts, many of these SIARs were used as workshops.

== Etymology ==
The original meaning and the language of origin of the place name &quot;Chan Chan&quot; remain unresolved issues among specialists. Among others, scholars such as Ernst Middendorf, Jorge Zevallos Quiñones, Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino and Matthias Urban have dealt with the question. The puzzle is made difficult by the erratic nature of its written record in colonial documents and by the linguistic situation of the pre-Hispanic North Peruvian coast. As is known, the Trujillo region presented the Mochica, Quingnam, Culli and Quechua languages, among others, of which only Mochica and Quechua are sufficiently documented. Regarding the variation in its written record, the toponym appears for the first time in documentation written as &#x27;Cauchan&#x27; in the foundation act of the Trujillo town council of 1536. It has also been proposed that the name &#x27;Canda&#x27; offered by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo to refer to Trujillo is another written variant of the modern &quot;Chan Chan&quot;. The form &#x27;Chanchan&#x27; only appears in documentation in a stable manner from the mid-17th century onwards.

According to the review of antecedents offered by Urban, there have been three previous etymological proposals for the toponym, two of which can be considered completely fanciful and unmotivated. The etymologies of H. Bauman as &#x27;city of snakes&#x27;, who unmotivatedly appeals to Mesoamerican languages, and that of J. Kimmich as &#x27;city of the moon&#x27;, who unmotivatedly appeals to a Cariban word for &#x27;moon&#x27;, deserve the latter qualification. The third etymological hypothesis was postulated by German scholar Ernst Middendorf, who offers the Mochica noun &quot;xllang&quot; &#x27;sun&#x27; as etym and finds in the toponym a reduplication of that root. Without being convinced by any of these previous proposals, Urban is inclined to the tentative attribution of the toponym to the extinct Quingnam language already proposed by Zevallos Quiñones in the XXth century. According to these authors, although it is not possible to offer an etym nor a primary meaning for the place name, the quingnam attribution is justified by the fact that this was the language of the kingdom of Chimor and by the similarity in its apparent structure with other regional toponyms and anthroponyms also apparently constituted by the reduplication of two monosyllabic roots. Urban concludes that
More recently, linguist Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino has proposed a Quechua etymology for the toponym. According to his hypothesis, both the form &#x27;Chanchan&#x27; and the variants &#x27;Cauchan&#x27; and &#x27;Canda&#x27; may well be explained by a Quechua etym &quot;kanĉa&quot; &#x27;corral, fence, fenced place&#x27; and the Quechumaran toponymic morpheme &quot;*-n&quot; (of probable Aymara etymology). Thus, the current pronunciation would be the product of an &quot;orthographic trap&quot;, since originally the &lt;ch&gt; would have been used to represent the sound of a voiceless velar stop [k] at the beginning of the word. Originally, the toponym would have been *&quot;kanĉa-n(i)&quot; &#x27;(place) where fences/ corrals abound&#x27;. According to this proposal, the toponym would be neither Mochica nor Quingnam, nor would it be so ancient in time. However, Urban has rejected Cerrón-Palomino&#x27;s hypothesis as implausible and ratified his previous conclusions.

== History ==
Chan Chan is believed to have been constructed around 850 AD by the Chimú. It was the Chimor empire capital city with an estimated population of 40,000–60,000 people.

After the Inca conquered the Chimú around 1470 AD, Chan Chan fell into decline. the Incas used a system called the &quot;Mitma system of ethnic dispersion&quot; which separated the chimú civilians into places already recently conquered by the Inca. A little over 60 years later in 1535 AD, Francisco Pizarro founded the Spanish city of Trujillo which pushed Chan Chan further into the shadows. While no longer a teeming capital city, Chan Chan was still well known for its great riches and was consequently looted by the Spaniards. An indication of the great Chimú wealth is seen in a sixteenth-century list of items looted from a burial tomb in Chan Chan; a treasure equivalent to 80,000 pesos of gold was recovered (nearly $5,000,000 US dollars in gold).

In 1969, Michael Moseley and Carol J. Mackey began excavations of Chan Chan; today these excavations continue under the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Cultura.

===Conservation plan===
In 1998, The &quot;Master Plan for Conservation and Management of the Chan Chan Archeological Complex&quot; was drawn up by the Freedom National Culture Institute of Peru with contributions from the World Heritage Foundation – WHR, ICCROM, and GCI. The plan was approved by the Peruvian Government. Methods of conservation include reinforcement and stabilization of structures of main buildings and around the Tschudi Palace, using a blend of traditional and modern engineering techniques. Chan Chan currently has 46 points of critical damage, though the site&#x27;s total damage far exceeds these points. The regional government of La Libertad is funding conservation efforts at these points.

==== UNESCO World Heritage Site ====

On 28 November 1986, UNESCO designated Chan Chan as a World Heritage Site, and placed it on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The World Heritage Committee&#x27;s initial recommendations included taking the appropriate measures for conservation, restoration, and management; halting any excavation that did not have accompanying conservation measures; and mitigation of plundering. A Pan-American Course on the Conservation and Management of Earthen Architectural and Archaeological Heritage was funded by many institutes coming together, including ICCROM, the Getty Conservation Institute, and the Government of Peru. Archeologists have been trying to protect this city in many ways. They are trying to create rain coverings over the buildings to protect them from the rain and save the adobe buildings that are deteriorating. They have also been trying to create new drainage systems to drain the rainwater faster. Chan Chan has been on the world heritage danger list since 1986. since 2000 they have implemented safety measures that include documentation of everything, public management, and an emergency and disaster plan.

== Archeological site ==

The archaeological site covers an area of approximately , being considered the largest adobe city in the Americas and the second in the world.

The walled compounds (palaces) that make up the metropolis are those in the following table. Recently, archaeologist have given Mochica names to such compounds, despite Chimor having spoken other language than Mochica. This has been criticized as a denial of local history.

=== Walled compound Tschudi ===
The walled complex &quot;Tschudi&quot; is the greatest in illustration of the importance of water, particularly of the sea, and of the cult that surrounded it in the Chimu culture. The high reliefs of the walls represent fish, directed towards the north and the south (what can be interpreted as representation of the two currents that mark the Peruvian coast: that of Humboldt, cold, that comes from the south and the one of El Niño, hot, that comes from the north), waves, rombito (fishing nets), as well as pelicans and anzumitos (mixture of sea lion and otter).

This coastal society was governed by the powerful Chimucapac and was united by the force of a social control originated in the necessity of a strict management of the water, as well as by the external threats. The &quot;Tschudi&quot; complex had a single entrance and high walls up to twelve meters for a better defense, and was wider at its bases (five meters) than at its summits (one meter), in anticipation of possible earthquakes on the seismic coast.

== Buildings ==
Chan Chan has many different types of buildings many of which have been destroyed. Many of the buildings included temples, houses, reservoirs and even funeral platforms. Many of the buildings consisted of ocean like designs such as fish, birds, waves and more. The way the Chimú utilized the space is astonishing. They build the building mostly in a rectangular or square shape through tight spaces.

The city also consisted of 10 citadels yet only 4 have been recovered. This means the city of Chan Chan had 10 rulers, the Chimú were very adamant on the &quot;Great Lord on top&quot;. The culture lived in a classist society where the rulers and gods were on top then it went all the way down to servants. A citadels complex is usually 40 feet tall and built with only one entrance. It was a palace type place with beautiful decorations and was built for a &quot;god or ruler&quot;.

== Workers and people ==

Chan Chan held many different types of workers and people. They lived in a classist society where rulers and gods came first and servants last. The city consisted of nobles, farmers, fishers, trader, servants, and many more. They had many craftsmen in the city who designed beautiful fabrics, pots, and ceramics.

The chimú civilians had a belief that the sun created three eggs, gold for the ruler and the elite, silver was for the wives of the rulers and copper was for anyone else not in those two categories. The elite were the ones who lived in the citadels. the rest of the civilians lived in small home that doubled as their workshops.

Although they were an agriculture city, the Chimú people did excellent jobs on their pottery and textiles and is what they are most famous for. They designed many beautiful pieces of artwork, some of which is still around today.

== Religion and culture ==

The Chimu have 10 citadels, but the Tschudi is the only one that tourists are allowed into. It is believed that Tschudi was built in honor of the Chimú God of the sea whose name in quingnam is unknown. This is believed because of the many ocean-related figures in the building. There was a pond in the middle of the building that was used for religious ceremonies, fertility, and even worshipping water. Something that the Chimu civilians worship very much is the ocean, they are directly next to the Pacific Ocean and get most of their food through it. They also relied very much on their irrigation system, so they believe that worshipping gods related to the ocean is important.

The Chan Chan civilians supposedly spoke the language &quot;quingnam&quot;. Once the Inca took over this language was completely wiped out and is currently an extinct language. There&#x27;s very little documented on the quingnam language. unfortunately, there is no way for us to confirm how this language could have sounded. The Chimú civilian had no writing system where they documented their language.

Not only did they not have a documented writing system for their language, but they also had no written system for writing up blueprints or recording measurements. If you look at a photo of Chan Chan, you will notice how all the buildings are built in a distinct order with space between them. Although there was no documentation it is possible and a theory that they kept records called Khipus much like the Inca. Khipus are detailed records that are systems with knotted cords. Khipus can also be used in situations to communicate information.

== Architecture ==
The city has ten walled &quot;ciudadelas&quot; which housed ceremonial rooms, burial chambers, temples, reservoirs and residences for the Chimú kings. In addition to the &quot;ciudadelas&quot;, other compounds present in Chan Chan include courts, or &quot;audiencias&quot;, small, irregular agglutinated rooms (SIARs) and mounds called &quot;huacas&quot;. Evidence for the significance of these structures is seen in many funerary ceramics recovered from Chan Chan. Many images seemingly depict structures very similar to &quot;audiencias&quot; which indicates the cultural importance of architecture to the Chimú people of Chan Chan. Additionally, the construction of these massive architectural feats indicates that there was a large labor force available at Chan Chan. This further supports evidence for a hierarchical structure of society in Chan Chan as it was likely that the construction of this architecture was done by the working class.

Chan Chan is triangular, surrounded by walls. There are no enclosures opening north because the north-facing walls have the greatest sun exposure, serving to block wind and absorb sunlight where fog is frequent. The tallest walls shelter against south-westerly winds from the coast. The walls are adobe brick covered with a smooth surface into which intricate designs are carved. The two styles of carving design include a realistic representation of subjects such as birds, fish, and small mammals, as well as a more graphic, stylized representation of the same subjects. The carvings at Chan Chan depict crabs, turtles, and nets for catching sea creatures (such as Spondylus. Chan Chan, unlike most coastal ruins in Peru, is very close to the Pacific Ocean.

===Irrigation===

Originally the city relied on wells that were around 15 meters deep. To increase the farmland surrounding the city, a vast network of canals diverting water from the Moche river were created. Once these canals were in place, the city had the potential to grow substantially. Many canals to the north were destroyed by a catastrophic flood around 1100 CE, which was the key motivation for the Chimú to refocus their economy to one rooted in foreign resources rather than in subsistence farming. Chan Chan&#x27;s irrigations systems were one of the main reasons they ended up being conquered by the Incas. Since the canals could run as long as 20 miles down the mountain of the Moche Vally River into Chan Chan, the Incas ended up cutting off their irrigation system which left them with dying crops from lack of water.

===Threats===

The ancient structures of Chan Chan are threatened by erosion due to changes in weather patterns — heavy rains, flooding, and strong winds. In particular, the city is severely threatened by storms from El Niño, which causes increased precipitation and flooding on the Peruvian coast. Chan Chan is the largest mud city in the world, and its fragile material is cause for concern. The heavy rains of El Niño damages the base of Chan Chan&#x27;s structures. Increased rain also leads to increased humidity, and as humidity gathers in the bases of these structures, salt contamination and vegetation growth can occur, which further damage the integrity of Chan Chan&#x27;s foundations. Global warming will only further these negative impacts, as some models suggest climate change facilitates increased precipitation.

==Recent archaeological conservation surveys==

The archaeological site at Chan Chan is under constant and severe threat of ruin from weathering. Several archaeologists, conservationists, and an array of institutions are working to survey the architecture existing there. Different methods of survey can be utilized but any methodology must be both quick enough to maximize access to extant physical material and accurate enough to document the site effectively. In order to meet these requirements, unmanned aerial vehicles are being utilized. The current state of UAV technology is such that craft consisting of relatively small components combined with lightweight imaging technology can be employed. The possible imaging products include Digital Elevation Models, ortho-photos, and 3 Dimensional Virtual Models. Protective coverings at the site, intended to inhibit the extent of weathering damage to adobe structures, can be a challenge to the use of UAV&#x27;s. These methods do not contribute to decay of the physical material. These methods also allow archaeologists to have access to the virtual reproductions into the future and foreseeable technological innovations will most likely add to the potential for analysis of the site.

The Italian Mission in Peru has been working alongside local archaeologists and excavators at the Chan Chan site since 2002. Roberto Pierdicca of the Polytechnic University of the Marches (Ancona, Italy) conducted imaging missions and compiled a series of results to make conclusions about the scale of the site in 2017. The newest mapwork of the site until this time was created by Harvard University in 1974. Pierdicca&#x27;s mission mapped a portion of the site known as the Tschudi Palace. His work was presented in the eighth volume of Digital Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage in 2018. The mission employed a Da-Jiang Innovations drone equipped with a Sony Alpha NEX-7 6000 x 3376 pixel resolution camera. The equipment allowed for both nadir imaging (downward vertical) imaging and oblique (angled) imaging. 1856 images were acquired and 1268 of these were used to create a 15 strip photogrammetric model. In order to construct the three-dimensional model, 105 images taken from ground level with a Sony SLT-A77V camera. Multi View Stereo processing was used to combine the overhead images with those from the ground and form the 3D model. This model was validated by archaeologists and is considered to be compliant with both the Seville Principles and the London Charter. These models form a baseline for future combinations of overhead imaging with ground surveys at other sites. The archaeological approach is important for the conservation of sites as it allows the data to exist into the future even as looting occurs and weathering takes place.

Between 2016 and 2022, an international project between the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) and the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Tecnológica (CONCYTEC) was conducted at the site. The work intended to build a 3D Heritage Building Information Model (HBIM) of the Huaca Arco Iris, the largest adobe monumental complex in South America. The huaca is placed chronologically alongside the first structures built at Chan Chan. The time frame of the site&#x27;s construction was towards the end of the Middle Horizon in the Central Andes. The primary function of the huaca is believed to have been a ceremonial funerary platform. In 1963, the Patrona de Arqueologia of Trujillo carried out a project to restore much of the walls at the site. This initiative refrained from adding any new artistic designs. This work contributes to the Plan Maestro de conservación y manejo del Complejo Arqueologico Chan Chan, a UNESCO required architectural conservation plan created by the Instituto Nacional de Cultura of Peru. Creating 3D models of the Huaca Arco Iris is one major initiative of the Italian Mission in Peru. The baseline methodology for the work was the data-information-knowledge system. The data acquisitional survey was initially conducted using spherical photogrammetry. An inspection of the huaca was carried out in 2018 by the Italian Mission. They uncovered additional brick layers on the outside of the south-eastern wall. A Sony Alpha 77 camera was utilized to capture 43 images. With the help of Metashape software, the team created a 3D textured mesh model of the wall. Combined with 3D meshes of the famous bas-reliefs of the other adobe and brick walls, this model was placed into Rhinoceros software to make 3D models of the wall&#x27;s architectural components. Colosi et al. reached several conclusions in their work. One conclusion is that consistent monitoring of the huaca and Chan Chan as a whole is necessary for limiting anthropogenic damage. The primary conclusion is that ontology-based Heritage Building Information Models are necessary for the longevity of the physical structures and the collective memory of Chan Chan.

Clay and straw mud architecture is believed to be the oldest building method on earth. It is extremely versatile, especially considering any size bricks can be created and used to build any size structure. 180 UNESCO World Heritage are constructed to some degree from mud. An international conference for the theme of adobe architecture took place in Iran in 1972. In 1994, the Getty Center established a course on mud architecture and its conservation at the Museo de Sitio at Chan Chan.

<doc id="1220148" wikidata="Q723693" url="?curid=1220148" title="Ottis Toole">
<text>Ottis Elwood Toole (March 5, 1947 – September 15, 1996) was an American serial killer who was convicted of six counts of murder. Like his companion Henry Lee Lucas, Toole made confessions which resulted in murder convictions, and which he later recanted. The discrediting of the case against Lucas for crimes for which Toole had offered corroborating statements created doubts as to whether either was a genuine serial killer or, as Hugh Aynesworth suggested, both were merely compliant interviewees whom police used to clear unsolved murders from the books.

Toole received two death sentences, but on appeal, they were commuted to life imprisonment. He died in his cell from cirrhosis, at age 49. Police attributed the 1981 murder of Adam Walsh to Toole on the basis of recanted statements. Lucas had backed Toole&#x27;s confession to the Walsh murder, claiming that he had been in possession of the victim&#x27;s severed head, though Lucas had a reputation for false confessions.

== Early life ==
Ottis Toole was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. Toole&#x27;s father was an alcoholic who abandoned him, while his abusive mother would dress him in girls&#x27; clothing and call him Susan. He was sexually abused as a child by many close relatives and acquaintances, including his older sister and a next-door neighbor. He stated that his maternal grandmother was a Satanist who exposed him to various Satanic practices and rituals in his youth, including graverobbing. Toole claimed this abuse began when he revealed his homosexuality to his family.

Toole was often classified as having a mild intellectual disability, with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 75. He also had epilepsy, which resulted in frequent grand mal seizures. Throughout Toole&#x27;s childhood, he frequently ran away from home and often slept in abandoned houses. He was a serial arsonist from a young age and was sexually aroused by fire.

In the documentary &quot;Death Diploma&quot;, Toole stated that he was forced to have sex with a friend of his father&#x27;s when he was five years old. He felt he knew that he was gay when he was 10 years old and that he had a sexual relationship with a neighborhood boy when he was 12. Toole dropped out of school in the ninth grade and began visiting gay bars. He also stated he had been a prostitute as a teenager and that he became obsessed with gay pornography at some point.

Toole stated that he committed his first murder at the age of 14, after being propositioned for sex by a traveling salesman. Toole ran over the salesman with his own car. Toole was first arrested at the age of 17 in August 1965 for loitering.

Much of the information about Toole&#x27;s activities between 1966 and 1973 is unclear, but authorities believe that he began drifting around the Southwestern United States and that he supported himself by prostitution and panhandling. While living in Nebraska, Toole was one of the prime suspects in the 1974 murder of 24-year-old Patricia Webb. Shortly after, he left Nebraska and briefly settled in Boulder, Colorado. One month later, he became a prime suspect in the homicide of 31-year-old Ellen Holman, who was murdered on October 14, 1974. With many accusations being made against him, Toole left Boulder and headed back to Jacksonville.

In early 1975, Toole returned to Jacksonville after drifting and hitchhiking through the American South. On January 14, 1976, he married a woman 25 years his senior. She left him three days later, after discovering his homosexuality. Toole later said during an interview that his marriage was a tactic meant to conceal his true sexuality.

== Murders and imprisonment ==

In 1976, Toole met Henry Lee Lucas at a Jacksonville soup kitchen, and they likely developed a sexual relationship. Toole later claimed to have accompanied Lucas in 108 murders, sometimes committed at the behest of a cult called &quot;The Hands of Death&quot;. Police, however, discounted the uncorroborated claims about the cult&#x27;s existence.

On January 4, 1982, Toole barricaded 65-year-old George Sonnenberg in a boarding house where he was living in Jacksonville and set the house on fire. Sonnenberg died a week later of injuries he sustained in the fire. In April 1983, Toole was arrested for an unrelated arson incident in Jacksonville. Toole confessed to the crime and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Toole signed a confession stating that he and Sonnenberg had begun a sexual relationship and, after the two had an argument, Toole set Sonnenberg&#x27;s home on fire.

Two months later, in June, Lucas was arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm. It was then that Lucas began boasting about the murderous rampage orchestrated by the two. At first, Toole had denied involvement but later began backing up Lucas&#x27;s confessions. Lucas also backed Toole&#x27;s confession to the murder of Adam Walsh. Journalist Hugh Aynesworth and others investigated for articles that appeared in &quot;The Dallas Times Herald&quot;. It was calculated that Lucas would have had to use his 13-year-old Ford station wagon to cover in one month i.e., around per day, to have committed the crimes police attributed to him. Lucas became widely regarded as a compliant interviewee who was used by police to clear up unsolved murders that he had not been involved in, aided by Toole giving false statements in collaboration.

During Toole&#x27;s trial for murdering George Sonnenberg, Toole claimed that he did not light the home on fire and only signed the confession so he would be extradited back to Jacksonville. On April 28, 1984, a jury found Toole guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death. Later that year, Toole was found guilty of the February 1983 strangulation murder of a 19-year-old Tallahassee, Florida woman, and received a second death sentence; on appeal, however, both sentences were later commuted to life in prison.

After his incarceration, Toole pleaded guilty to four more Jacksonville murders in 1991 and received four more life sentences. The murders in which Toole was ultimately convicted of were John McDaniel, Jerilyn Peoples, Brenda Burton, Ruby McCary, George Sonnenberg and Ada Johnson, all of whom were killed in Florida from 1980 to 1983.

=== Murder of Adam Walsh ===

On October 21, 1983, while he was imprisoned for two unrelated murders, Toole confessed to the 1981 murder of six-year-old Adam Walsh. A few weeks after Toole made the confession, however, police officers who were investigating the case announced that they had lost Toole&#x27;s impounded car and machete. John Walsh, Adam&#x27;s father, continues to believe that Toole was guilty. On December 16, 2008, 27 years after the 1981 murder, Hollywood, Florida, police announced Toole as the murderer, and the Adam Walsh case was closed. The police did not reveal any new physical evidence and pointed out that they still had no DNA evidence.

Toole claimed that he picked Walsh up in a Sears mall parking lot. Toole stated that Walsh came willingly because he offered Walsh candy and toys. Walsh soon wanted to go home and began to cry. Toole said that he then punched Walsh in the face. Walsh started to cry again, and according to Toole, he began to &quot;wallop&quot; Walsh, knocking him out. Toole eventually pulled over in a rural area and decapitated Walsh with a machete. He drove around with Walsh&#x27;s head for several days, forgot about it, and, after he rediscovered it, he tossed it into a nearby canal. Police officers inexplicably lost Toole&#x27;s impounded car and its bloodstained carpeting, hindering their ability to proceed with the investigation into Adam Walsh&#x27;s murder.

=== Other confessions ===
In 1984, Toole confessed to two unsolved northwest Florida slayings, including one of the I-10 murders. During an interview, he admitted to killing 18-year-old David Schallart, a hitchhiker who he picked up east of Pensacola. Schallart&#x27;s body, bearing five gunshot wounds in the left side of the head, was found on February 6, 1980, approximately off I-10&#x27;s eastbound lane, east of Chipley. The second confession involved the death of 20-year-old Ada Johnson. Toole confessed that he shot her in the head on a road outside of Fort Walton Beach after kidnapping her at gunpoint at a Tallahassee nightclub. Psychiatrists Dr. Urbina and Dr. Sanches testified at Toole&#x27;s 1984 Florida Supreme Court appeal that he was extremely impulsive and exhibited antisocial behavior as a result of a personality disorder and that he was a pyromaniac. The court found sufficient evidence that Toole could be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.

Hollywood, Florida Police Chief Chadwick Wagner said that Toole had been the prime suspect all along, but he went on to admit that although Toole&#x27;s case was weak, he could have been charged during the original investigation of it. Wagner acknowledged the fact that many mistakes were made by the department and apologized to the Walsh family on its behalf. Wagner also acknowledged the fact that the lack of new evidence and the inability of Toole to defend himself could provide room for skeptics to doubt Toole&#x27;s guilt, saying, &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for that magic wand, that one piece of evidence, it&#x27;s not there.&quot; However, after the police reexamined previously uncorrelated evidence, they and the Walsh family were both satisfied with the new report and the existing evidence which only points to Ottis Toole.

==Death==
Toole died of cirrhosis at the Florida State Prison on September 15, 1996, at the age of 49. His body went unclaimed, and he was buried in the Florida State Prison cemetery.

<text>Fred McNess VC (22 January 1892 – 4 May 1956) was an English-born Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

McNess was 24 years old, and a lance-sergeant in the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 15 September 1916 near Ginchy, France, during a period of severe fighting, Lance-Sergeant McNess led his men with great dash in the face of heavy shell and machine-gun fire. When the first line of the enemy trenches was reached, it was found that the left flank was exposed and that the enemy were bombing down the trench. McNess then organised and led a counter-attack and, although he was very severely wounded in the neck and jaw, did not give up. Finally he established a &quot;block&quot; and continued encouraging his men and throwing bombs until exhausted by loss of blood.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant. The severe nature of his wounds left Ness in lifelong pain which eventually led him to take his own life. His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Scots Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks in London.

<doc id="1220156" wikidata="Q275651" url="?curid=1220156" title="Leopold III, Duke of Austria">
<text>Leopold III (1 November 1351 – 9 July 1386), known as the Just, a member of the House of Habsburg, was Duke of Austria from 1365. As head and progenitor of the Leopoldian line, he ruled over the Inner Austrian duchies of Carinthia, Styria and Carniola as well as the County of Tyrol and Further Austria from 1379 until his death.

==Biography==
Born in Vienna, Leopold was a younger son of Duke Albert II of Austria (thereby a grandson of King Albert I of Germany), and younger brother of the Dukes Rudolf IV and Albert III. His mother, Joanna of Pfirt, a daughter of Princess Joanna of Burgundy, was 51 when she gave birth to him and died shortly after. Upon the death of Albert II, his eldest son Rudolf IV, called the Founder, assumed the rule over the Habsburg dominions, despite the regulations on a joint rule left by his father. Nevertheless, on 18 November 1364 he promulgated his own house law (&quot;Rudolfinische Hausordnung&quot;), according to which the Austrian &quot;hereditary lands&quot; were again declared a common possession of the brothers, though the eldest received a number of additional rights.

After Rudolf&#x27;s death on 27 July 1365, Albert III and Leopold (their elder brother Friedrich had died in 1362) assumed the rule over the Habsburg lands, with Albert taking the additional rights as eldest. While Albert ruled, Leopold became a general leading Habsburg troops in battle. In 1368 he defeated a Bavarian incursion into Tirol, bringing all of Tirol under Habsburg authority in 1370. In 1372 Leopold broke with his brother over rights, prestige and income that he felt he was owed. On 25 July 1373 the brothers signed a peace treaty which granted Leopold control over Tirol, Further Austria and Carniola while income would be split between the dukes. In 1375 their relative Enguerrand VII de Coucy led a mercenary army into Alsace and Switzerland to capture the Habsburg possessions of Sundgau, Breisgau and the county of Ferrette in the Gugler war of 1375. After Leopold was unable to defeat his cousin, he retreated to Breisach on the Rhine. A coalition of Swiss cities then attacked and drove the Gugler army out of their country and ended the war.

By 1375 Leopold had inherited the former Gorizia possessions in the Windic March, White Carniola, Friuli and Istria and the city of Feldkirch in Vorarlberg. On 6 August 1376 he was granted the right to make alliances with foreign rulers. In 1377 Albert traveled to Prussia for about five months, leaving Leopold in charge of all the Habsburg lands. During this time, Leopold signed a peace treaty with one of his brother&#x27;s bitterest rivals, Heinrich von Schaunberg. When on 7 July 1379 he and Albert III signed the Treaty of Neuberg, Leopold became the exclusive ruler of Styria (then including Wiener Neustadt), Carinthia, Carniola, Tyrol and the Further Austrian lands in Swabia. In 1382 he was granted the city of Trieste as part of his payment for defeating Venice.

Leopold significantly promoted trade and commerce in the Tyrolean lands, encouraging the development of cities such as Meran. He gained control over the city of Basel in 1376 and could also purchase Laufenburg from his Swabian Habsburg cousins ten years later. However, his further attempts to expand his position in Switzerland failed, when he was killed in the Battle of Sempach.

Initially buried in Königsfelden Monastery, his mortal remains were transferred firstly to St. Blaise Abbey in a solemn ceremony on 14 November 1770, and finally to Saint Paul&#x27;s Abbey, Carinthia.

==Family and children==
He was married, on 23 February 1365, to Viridis Visconti (1352–1414), second daughter of Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan, and Beatrice Regina della Scala. The marriage produced four sons and three daughters including the following:
#William, Duke of Austria
#Leopold IV, Duke of Austria
#Ernest, Duke of Austria
#Frederick IV, Duke of Austria
#Elisabeth (1378–1392)
#Margaretha (1370–?)
#Catherine (1385–?), Abbess of St. Klara in Vienna

Leopold was succeeded by his eldest son William who died in 1406. Other sons included Leopold, future Duke of Further Austria, Ernest the Iron, future Duke of Inner Austria, and Frederick, future Duke of Further Austria.

<text>Major John Vincent Holland VC (19 July 1889 – 27 February 1975), was World War I Irish soldier, and the recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
Holland was born into a middle-class family in Athy, County Kildare, the son of veterinary surgeon John Holland and Catherine Peppard. He was educated first at Clongowes Wood College and later at Liverpool University, and was one of 600 Old Clongovians to enlist in the army during World War One.

==World War 1==
On the outbreak of war he enlisted in the 2nd Life Guards in November 1914 undergoing his training in Combermere Barracks at Windsor. After a short time with the Life Guards he was granted a commission with the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians). In March 1915 he was attached to the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers and was then wounded in August and returned to England and Ireland to convalesce, but it wasn&#x27;t long until he was back in France and back with the 7th Battalion Leinster Regiment serving as battalion bombing officer.

On 3 September 1916, during the Somme Offensive, whilst engaged in intense combat in the vicinity of the village of Guillemont, Holland was awarded the Victoria Cross for the following action:

&quot;During a heavy engagement, Lt. Holland, not content with bombing hostile dug-outs, fearlessly led his troops through our own artillery barrage and cleared a great part of the village in front. He started out with 26 troops and finished with only five after capturing some 50 prisoners. By this gallant action he undoubtedly broke the spirit of the enemy and saved many casualties.&quot;

Holland was subsequently promoted to Captain. During the war he was also Mentioned in Dispatches and received a personal &quot;Hickie Parchment&quot; from his Divisional General-Officer-Commanding, Major-General William Hickie, in recognition of his bravery in action.

==Later life==
In 1917, Holland married Frances Grogan at the cathedral in Cork City. Together they had two sons: Major Niall V. Holland (d. 1944), who was killed in Burma during the Second World War and Norman J. Holland.

He was seconded for service with the Indian Army in the rank of Lt. 31 October 1919. On 13 November 1919 he was appointed on probation to the Indian Army as a Captain, an appointment that was confirmed on the 27th November 1920. In September 1922 he retired from the army. 
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Holland again commissioned, serving as administrative officer of the 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, then re-joined the Indian Army but was invalided out in 1941. He then took up a position with the Ministry of Food. In 1956, Holland and his wife emigrated to Hobart, in Tasmania.

==Death==
Holland died in Hobart in February 1975 at the age of 85. His body was buried in Cornelian Bay Cemetery, with military honours. His wife, Frances, pre-deceased him, dying in 1960. Holland lived to see the birth of his great-grandchild.

==Tribute==
On 3 September 2009 a memorial plaque was unveiled at Guillemont Church in France dedicated to the memory of the three soldiers who won Victoria Crosses in the fighting at the village during the Somme in 1916, Holland&#x27;s name being one of the three.

<doc id="1220169" wikidata="Q7395767" url="?curid=1220169" title="Sab (novel)">
<text>Sab is a novel written by Gertrudis Gomez de Avellaneda and published in Madrid in 1841. The novel centers around the character of Sab, a mulato slave who is in love with his white master&#x27;s daughter Carlota. The pain of Sab&#x27;s unrequited love for Carlota leads Sab to his own death, which occurs during Carlota&#x27;s wedding to Enrique Otway. The novel was not published in Cuba until 1914.

&quot;Sab&quot; is regarded by some scholars as an anti-slavery novel, and some have also suggested that it criticizes the institution of marriage. The novel was written a decade before Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. According to Nina M. Scott, &quot;Sab&quot;, just like Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel, criticizes slavery as a displacement of what Elizabeth Ammons calls &quot;maternal values by a profit-hungry masculine ethic [the slave economy] that regards human beings as... commodities.&quot; The publishing of &quot;Sab&quot; is considered a precursor to the antislavery movements. 

For another critic, &quot;Sab&quot; is &quot;the only feminist-abolitionist novel published by a woman in nineteenth-century Spain or its slave-holding colony Cuba.&quot;

==Plot==
The novel is set on a sugar plantation located halfway between the city of Santa María de Puerto Príncipe (modern-day Camagüey) and the village of Cubitas. While most of the novel takes places at the plantation, some of it takes place in Puerto Príncipe, in the Cubitas Mountains, and in the northern port of Guanaja.
Enrique Otway, an English tradesman, seeks to marry Carlota because he thinks that this arrangement will bring him money. As the story develops, Sab learns of Enrique&#x27;s dishonorable conduct and tries to secretly aid Carlota.

==Background==
Although &quot;Sab&quot; was initially published in Madrid in December 1841, Avellaneda began writing the book in Cuba and continued working on it during the two-month journey to Europe in 1836.

==Translations==
&quot;Sab&quot; was translated into English by Nina M. Scott in 1993, and published by the University of Texas Press.

The game received mostly favourable reviews, with the exception of the PC version which received mixed feedback. The game has sold one million copies worldwide and was nominated for &quot;Originality&quot; and &quot;Best Game on GameCube&quot; at 2nd British Academy Games Awards.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Second Sight&quot;, players explore levels primarily with a third-person perspective which by default is in free-roam but can be switched to a fixed perspective though at times the camera switches to a first-person viewpoint either by switching it through the camera controls, or when moving through a crawlspace. Each level features a set of tasks that culminate in the player reaching a goal to complete the level, with a different range of situations to overcome, including hostile enemies that either must be killed or avoided with stealth, as well as minor puzzles and obstacles to overcome.

&quot;Second Sight&quot;″s most unique aspect of gameplay is the protagonist&#x27;s ability to use a variety of psychic powers, which can be used either to aid the player in combat, heal themselves or others, avoid detection, and help to solve some puzzles. At the start of the game, the player begins with only a few powers, but unlock new ones and upgrades to those they possess as the story progresses. These powers drain the player&#x27;s psychic energy either in a set amount or over time; if the player is drained of psychic energy, they are momentarily stunned for a few seconds, leaving them vulnerable.

For the most part, several levels emphasis the use of stealth to make progress, including watching the movement of hostiles, and making use of hiding places like closets. To assist in stealth, some levels provide a player with a silenced tranquilliser gun which can be used to silently knock out enemies. If the player is spotted by an enemy or a security camera, the alarm is raised, causing more hostiles to arrive within the area the protagonist is within. The alarm can only be cancelled if the player hides from enemies until they lose sight of them; when they do, enemies will return to their routines, with reinforcements replacing those who will taken out by the player before the alarm was raised.

Combat features not only unarmed fighting, but a range of different weapons including pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. Cover can be used to protect against gunfire when shooting at enemies, with the game&#x27;s targeting system designed to allow players to specifically target different parts on an enemy; the sniper rifle&#x27;s scope is displayed on screen when used to target an enemy. Weapons can be used when in first-person, allowing more refined manual targeting for players to make use of.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Second Sight&quot; takes place in a world in which parapsychology exists, and where secret research on its power after World War II uncovered evidence that psychic abilities could be genetically transferred into other human beings. The story&#x27;s events take place across locations within the United States and Siberia, during the late 1990s.

===Story===
John Vattic, an American parapsychology researcher, awakens in a medical facility in Virginia with no recollection of his past, only the knowledge that he possesses powerful psychic abilities of unknown origin. Using these to escape his cell and explore the facility, he later experiences a flashback that reveals to him that six months ago, he was recruited by the Pentagon to join up with WinterICE - a special taskforce of U.S. Marines led by Colonel Joshua Starke, and his psychic adviser Jayne Wilde. The taskforce had been given orders to travel to Siberia to recover Victor Grienko, a renowned Russian scientist who had conducted extensive research into parapsychology, and was now seeking political asylum in the United States.

Whilst seeking further answers, John is surprised when he comes across records on Jayne in the facility&#x27;s computers, only to witness them change following a flashback where, instead of being killed on the mission, Jayne survived, only to be incarcerated at a mental asylum in Vermont after losing her mind. With no other leads, John escapes the facility and travels to the asylum, breaking Jayne out. After she recovers her sanity in his presence, Jayne reveals that Stark was killed in his presence, causing John to experience another flashback. In the past, he finds himself saving Stark - changing the past again as a result - while encountering the projection of a Russian boy, who claims he must help them and unlocks his psychic abilities in the past, revealing John must get to their home beneath a village called Dubrensk.

In the present, Jayne leads John to Stark&#x27;s hideout in Queens, New York, and learns from Stark that their mission to secure Grienko led to them discovering American special forces operating in Siberia on the same task. John learns the troops were being led by Silas Hanson, director of the National Security Executive, who used Stark and his team as scapegoats to cover up his actions, and who is now tying up loose ends. After Stark helps him to escape his tenement hideout, John sees Hanson&#x27;s people capture Jayne, and pursues them to the NSE headquarters in New Jersey. Exploring the facility, John uncovers video evidence showing that Hanson seeks to create psychic supersoldiers from Grienko&#x27;s work and moves to confront Hanson in his office. Finding Hanson cannot be defeated, no matter what he tries, John forces himself to experience a flashback and return to the past.

Back in the past, John explores Dubrensk on his own, after Jayne instructs Stark that his team has done what they can. Finding Grienko&#x27;s research labs under the village, John confronts Grienko with the knowledge he has from the present. Grienko, realizing Hanson had deceived him for his research, informs John to head for the lower levels, before he is killed by an NSE agent. Making his way underground, John suddenly hears Jayne&#x27;s voice, telling him his perception of time is all wrong; in reality, the present is actually a possible future being shown to him by the final psychic ability he possessed, precognition, which had been active the whole time, with the &quot;past&quot; actually being the present. Learning that the Russian boy was one of several children who Grienko experimented on, John realizes that they had foreseen what Hanson planned to do, and had contacted him, knowing he was the only one who could help them.

Now aware of the truth, and knowing what the future holds, John tracks down Hanson to Grienko&#x27;s lab and confronts him, only to discover him protected by a bullet-proof window. Releasing the children Grienko experimented on, they promptly use their powerful telekinesis abilities to reach Hanson and kill him. Returning to the surface, Vattic reunites with Stark and Wilde, who help him onto a helicopter leaving the area as American troops secure the location.

<text>William Odgers VC (14 February 1834 – 20 December 1873) was a Royal Navy sailor and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Odgers was born in Falmouth, Cornwall, on 14 February 1834.

==Victoria Cross==
Odgers was 26 years old, and a leading seaman in the Royal Navy during the First Taranaki War in New Zealand when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 March 1860 at Omata, Leading Seaman Odgers of displayed conspicuous gallantry when a party of officers, sailors and marines from the ship stormed Kaipopo Pa during operations against Maori insurgents. His citation read:
This was the first VC won in New Zealand. A few days later, HMS &quot;Niger&quot; bombarded civilian fishing villages at Warea, about 40 kilometres south of New Plymouth, where the defeated Maori force had regrouped, with cannon and rockets.

This action was labelled a &quot;fictional triumph&quot; and a myth by New Zealand revisionist historian James Belich. However Nigel Prickett embellished the action as a catastrophic defeat for southern insurgents who virtually no casualties Kaipopo Pa.

==Later life==
Odgers later achieved the rank of quartermaster, and was in the Coast Guard Service. He died in Saltash, Cornwall, on 20 December 1873.

His medal is displayed at Sheesh Mahal Museum, Patiala, India.

<doc id="1220177" wikidata="Q7861088" url="?curid=1220177" title="Typhonian Order">
<text>The Typhonian Order, previously known as Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis (T.O.T.O.), is a self-initiatory magical organization based in the United Kingdom that focuses on magical and Typhonian concepts. It was originally led by British occultist Kenneth Grant (1924–2011) and his wife Steffi Grant, and is now led by their deputy Michael Staley.

The Typhonian Order is among the most well-known Thelemic magical orders, primarily due to the publications of Kenneth Grant. In particular, it has influenced Dragon Rouge and was instrumental in the creation of Nema Andahadna&#x27;s Maat Magick movement.

While the group continues to promote Aleister Crowley&#x27;s religion Thelema, it also focuses on exploration of foreign intelligence such as extraterrestrial life and daemons, as well as the darker aspects of occult existence.

While not central to the Typhonian Order one of the most notable, studied and controversial aspects of the tradition surround Kenneth Grant&#x27;s use of the fictional works of cosmic horror author H.P. Lovecraft to explore occult psychology in that he viewed the entities of the Cthulhu Mythos not merely as fictional creations but as manifestations of archetypal realities, possibly even as symbolic representations of actual spiritual forces or beings.

==History==
Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.) was founded by the wealthy German industrialist Carl Kellner. After Kellner&#x27;s death in 1905, Theodor Reuss became Outer Head of the Order.

In 1920, Reuss suffered a stroke, leading Aleister Crowley to question his competence to continue as Outer Head of the Order. By 1921, Crowley and Reuss were exchanging angry letters, culminating in Reuss&#x27; expulsion of Crowley from O.T.O. Crowley then informed Reuss that he was proclaiming himself Outer Head of the Order. Reuss died in 1923 without naming a successor, and Crowley was subsequently elected and ratified as Outer Head of the Order in a Conference of Grand Masters in 1925. World War II then intervened, destroying the European branches of O.T.O. and driving its members underground. Karl Germer was incarcerated by the Nazis. By the end of the war, the sole surviving O.T.O. organization was Agapé Lodge in California, where Germer moved after he was released from internment in 1941.

After Crowley&#x27;s death, Germer was his unchallenged successor for some time, and recognized and endorsed Grant&#x27;s status as a IX° (Ninth Degree) adept in 1948. However Grant later claimed that his assumption of the XI° (Eleventh Degree) was confirmed in 1946, presumably by Crowley, the same year that he was initiated into the A∴A∴, an associated Thelemic magical order created by Crowley in 1907 after leaving the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

In 1954, Grant began the work of founding the New Isis Lodge, which became operational in 1955 when Grant announced his discovery of a &quot;Sirius/Set current&quot; in a new manifesto upon which the lodge would be based. In this manifesto, Grant wrote that a new energy was emanating down from Earth from another planet which he identified with Nuit, a goddess who appears in the first chapter of Crowley&#x27;s Thelemic holy text, &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Germer however deemed it &quot;blasphemy&quot; that Grant had identified a single planet with Nuit; on 20 July 1955, Germer issued a &quot;Note of Expulsion&quot; expelling Grant from O.T.O. 

In 1969, Grant co-edited &quot;The Confessions of Aleister Crowley&quot; for publication with Crowley&#x27;s literary executor John Symonds. Over the coming years he edited – often with Symonds – a range of Crowley writings for republication, resulting in the release of &quot;The Magical Record of the Beast 666&quot; (1972), &quot;Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot; (1972), &quot;Moonchild&quot; (1972), &quot;Magick&quot; (1973), &quot;Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on The Book of the Law&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Complete Astrological Writings&quot; (1974). The release of these publications has been described as being &quot;instrumental in the revival of interest in Crowley&quot;.

At this point, Grant began describing himself as O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.

Grant&#x27;s work and the organization itself moved increasingly away from the traditional O.T.O. structures and teachings, towards a more distinct identity. The renaming to &quot;The Typhonian Order&quot; signifies this ideological and practical departure, focusing more explicitly on Grant&#x27;s specific interests in the darker aspects of the occult, extraterrestrial dimensions of consciousness, and the exploration of what he termed the &quot;Tunnels of Set.&quot; These concepts delve into areas of the occult that are far removed from the original teachings of the O.T.O., hence the rebranding serves not only as a formal but also a symbolic declaration of independence and differentiation.

==Work of the order==
Grant promoted what he termed the Typhonian or Draconian tradition of magic, and wrote that Thelema was only a recent manifestation of this wider tradition. In his books, he portrayed the Typhonian tradition as the world&#x27;s oldest spiritual tradition, suggesting that it had ancient roots in Africa. In Central Africa during prehistory, he believed there had been a religion devoted to the worship of a goddess known as Ta-Urt or Typhon, from which the Typhonian tradition stems. This was an idea he had adopted from Gerald Massey&#x27;s 1881 publication &quot;A Book of Beginnings&quot;, a work promoting ideas which had never been accepted among scholars. According to Grant, Typhonianism was typified by its worship of female deities and its use of sex as a method of spiritual achievement. He wrote that this tradition spread throughout the world, forming the basis of forms of ancient Egyptian religion as well as Indian Tantra and forms of Western esotericism. He added that for millennia, the Typhonian tradition has been opposed by the &quot;Osirians&quot; or &quot;Solarites&quot;, practitioners of patriarchal and solar religions, who have portrayed the Typhonians as evil, corrupt, and debauched. The religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic noted that Grant&#x27;s Typhonian history was &quot;at best highly speculative&quot; and lacked any supporting evidence, however he suggested that Grant may never have intended it to be taken literally.

Grant adopted a perennialist interpretation of the history of religion. Grant&#x27;s wrote that Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga correlate to Western esoteric traditions, and that both stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant&#x27;s appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has much in common with Theosophy, although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the &#x27;left-hand path&#x27;.

Influenced by Maharshi, Grant adopted the Advaitan world-view that only &quot;the Self&quot;, or &quot;atman&quot;, really exists, with the wider universe being an illusory projection. He believed that by mastering magic, one masters this illusory universe, gaining personal liberation and recognising that only the Self really exists. Doing so, according to Grant, leads to the discovery of one&#x27;s True Will, the central focus of Thelema. Grant further wrote that the realm of the Self was known as &quot;the Mauve Zone&quot;, and that it could be reached while in a state of deep sleep, where it has the symbolic appearance of a swamp. He also believed that the reality of consciousness, which he deemed the only true reality, was formless and thus presented as a void, although he also taught that it was symbolised by the Hindu goddess Kali and the Thelemic goddess Nuit.

Grant&#x27;s views on sex magic drew heavily on the importance of sexual dimorphism among humans and the subsequent differentiation of gender roles. Grant taught that the true secret of sex magic were bodily secretions, the most important of which was a woman&#x27;s menstrual blood. In this he differed from Crowley, who viewed semen as the most important genital secretion. Grant referred to female sexual secretions as &quot;kalas&quot;, a term adopted from Sanskrit. He thought that because women have kalas, they have oracular and visionary powers. The magical uses of female genital secretions are a recurring theme in Grant&#x27;s writings. He believed that the XI° degree O.T.O. ritual, which Crowley argued necessitated anal sex, should instead involve vaginal sex with a menstruating woman. He was critical of Crowley&#x27;s use of anal sex in rituals, stating his view that the &quot;sodomitical formula&quot; was &quot;a perversion of magical practice&quot;. These views have brought accusations of homophobia from later occultists such as Phil Hine.

==Relationship to H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu mythos==
In Grant&#x27;s perspective, Lovecraft&#x27;s narratives and mythos tapped into the same primordial truths and cosmic mysteries that esoteric traditions and magical practices sought to explore. This conceptual synthesis is apparent in the Typhonian Tradition, which integrates Thelemic principles with themes derived from Lovecraft&#x27;s work, among other influences. The Typhonian Order, thus, stands as a unique bridge between the realms of early 20th-century esoteric practices and the cosmic horror genre of fiction.

<text>The Treaty of the Dardanelles (also known as the Dardanelles Treaty of Peace, Commerce, and Secret Alliance, the Treaty of Çanak, the Treaty of Chanak or ) was concluded between the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain on 5 January 1809 at Çanak, Ottoman Empire. The treaty ended the Anglo-Turkish War. The Porte (the Ottoman government) restored extensive British commercial and legal privileges in the empire. Britain promised to protect the integrity of the Ottoman Empire against the French threat, both with its own fleet and through weapons supplies to Constantinople. The treaty affirmed the principle that no warships of any power should enter the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosporus. The treaty anticipated the London Straits Convention of 1841, by which the other major powers committed themselves to this same principle.

<text>Netrabahadur Thapa Magar VC ( 8 January 1916 – 26 June 1944) was a Nepalese Gurkha recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

On 25–26 June 1944, at the age of twenty eight, Magar was an acting subedar of the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles in the Indian Army during World War II. He was in command of a small isolated hill post at Bishenpur, India when the Japanese army attacked in force. The men, inspired by their leader&#x27;s example, held their ground and the enemy were beaten off, but casualties were very heavy and reinforcements were requested. When these arrived some hours later they also suffered heavy casualties. Thapa retrieved the reinforcements&#x27; ammunition himself and mounted an offensive with grenades and kukris, until he was killed.

<doc id="1220187" wikidata="Q6039520" url="?curid=1220187" title="William Peel (Royal Navy officer)">
<text>Captain Sir William Peel VC KCB (2 November 1824 – 27 April 1858) was a British naval officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the third son of the Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel and his wife Julia. Like his father, he was educated at Harrow School.

He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and thus became Sir William Peel.

==Military career==
Peel was a captain in the Royal Navy, serving with the Naval Brigade during the Crimean War. On 18 October 1854 at the Siege of Sevastopol, he picked up a live shell with the fuse still burning from amongst several powder cases and threw it over the parapet. The shell burst as it left his hands. For this he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC); it is now displayed at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England.

On 5 November at the Battle of Inkerman, he joined some of the officers of the Grenadier Guards and helped to defend the Colours of the regiment when they were hard-pressed. On 18 June 1855, he led the first scaling party at the assault on the redan and was himself severely wounded. On each of these occasions Captain Peel was accompanied by a young midshipman, Edward St. John Daniel, as Aide-de-camp.

After the Crimean War, he served in the Indian Mutiny and was wounded at the Relief of Lucknow. At the age of 33, he died of smallpox at Cawnpore, India, on 27 April 1858.

==Travel==
Captain Peel wrote &quot;A Ride through the Nubian Desert&quot; (1852), detailing his travels of the preceding year.

==Memorials==

There is a memorial to Captain Peel and the Naval Brigade from on the seafront at Southsea, England.

There is a statue of William Peel by William Theed in the south transept of Saint Swithun&#x27;s Church, Sandy, in Bedfordshire. There are two copies of this statue, one in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich and one which was erected in Eden Gardens, Calcutta. This statue was moved to Barrackpore in 1977 and was due to be moved back to Calcutta in 2004 amid some confusion over its identity: it was thought to be Peel&#x27;s father, Robert Peel.

Opposite Sandy church across the High Street stands the Sir William Peel pub.

A plaque at The Lodge, headquarters of the RSPB in Sandy, commemorates the 150th anniversary of the death of Captain Sir William Peel. It is situated near the Swiss Cottage which he built in the 1850s, which is now the gatehouse to The Lodge, built by his brother Arthur Wellesley Peel. A similar plaque is mounted on a bench on Sandy High Street.

A statue of Peel by William Theed stands in the centre of Greenwich Maritime Museum.

<text>A staff clerk is a professional specialist clerk in the British Army who is a member of an administrative corps, as opposed to a unit clerk, who is a member of the corps or regiment in which they work and is trained first and foremost in the duties of that unit (such as an infantryman).

Staff clerks predominantly work in headquarters units alongside staff officers, hence the name. Clerks working in headquarters were consolidated into the Army Service Corps (later Royal Army Service Corps) during the Boer War. In the McLeod Reorganisation of Army Logistics, staff clerks were transferred to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in 1965.

In 1992, they were again transferred to the Staff and Personnel Support Branch of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Corps and were merged with unit clerks.

<text>Samuel Parkes VC (probably late 1815 – 15 November 1864) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Parkes was awarded his VC for his actions during the Charge of the Light Brigade.

==Details==
Born in Wigginton, Tamworth, Staffordshire probably in late 1815, he was baptised at the Church of St Editha, Tamworth on 24 December 1815, the son of Thomas Parks/Parkes and Lydia Fearn/Fern/Fearns; no exact date of birth has been established. Within the family, it is said that he was known as &quot;George&quot;. He had two sisters, Elizabeth (baptised 1812) and Mary (baptised 1819); no other siblings are recorded in St Editha&#x27;s baptismal register.

He died on 14 November 1864 at Stanhope Lodge, Hyde Park, London. He was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave (no. 39265, reference R80&#x27;6&quot; x 109&#x27; 3&quot;) on 19 November 1864 after a funeral at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. A memorial stone was placed on his grave in May 1999, thanks to the efforts of Peter Elkin, and a plaque was placed in Tamworth parish church on Balaklava Day 2004. A new memorial was unveiled in the village of his birth on 14 September 2011 following a fund-raising campaign by the people of Wigginton.

According to the Army, he was born in 1813. His own declaration on enlistment declares his age as 18 years old while his discharge papers state precisely that he was 44 years 3 months (i.e. he was born in August or September 1813). His death certificate and the Brompton Cemetery burial register both say, however, that he was aged 49 at death, in which case he was born in 1815. The years around 1830 were a time of agricultural depression in England so, like many before and since, the 16-year-old lad might have lied about his age to enlist in a secure job with reasonable pay. Furthermore, birth and baptism usually followed each other rapidly at that time. On balance, 1815 would seem to be the more likely year of his birth.

==Early career==
Described as a labourer, he enlisted in the 4th Queens Own Light Dragoons on 30 July 1831 and was discharged on 1 December 1857 with four good conduct badges, as an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital. He served 11 years with the 4th Light Dragoons in India, including the First Afghan War (Ghunzee medal), and in the Crimean War. Peacetime service with the 4th saw Parkes in Wales and Ireland as well as in England. At Balaklava, he was serving as an orderly to the regimental commanding officer, Colonel Lord George Paget.

Parkes&#x27; discharge papers show a chequered military career. He earned four good conduct badges, but he won and lost the first badge five times between 1838 and 1850 (i.e. covering his entire service in India and more). He gained the second only in January 1852 and then lost it the same year, regaining it in 1853. He then managed to gain a third in November 1855 and was awarded the fourth only on 18 November 1857 (four days after his discharge Board). In addition, he was sentenced to 56 days imprisonment in Galway Gaol in 1848 by a district court martial in Ireland. Parkes was confined on 9 November 1848, convicted on 21 November 1848 and released on 15 January 1849 – so in addition to his 56-day sentence he was in prison for 11 days before conviction. The offence itself is not specified in the Regimental Muster Roll. Neither is it mentioned in Parkes&#x27; discharge papers. But papers catalogued in The National Archives as WO 86/6 show that he was found guilty of being &#x27;drunk on duty&#x27; and was one of three privates from his regiment so convicted on the same day – one also received 56 days but the other was sentenced to 70 days. This blemished record explains why Parkes was not awarded the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, which for the cavalry then required 20 years of irreproachable character.

Parkes thus remained a Private in the 4th Light Dragoons (from 1861, the 4th Hussars - The Queen&#x27;s Own) throughout his career.

==Balaclava and the Victoria Cross==
He won his VC on 25 October 1854 in the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaklava during the Crimean War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 25 October 1854 at Balaclava, Crimean Peninsula, (Charge of the Light Brigade)

The VC citation refers to Hugh Crawford as being a Trumpet Major, but he was not promoted to that rank until 1 December 1855.

Elkin claims to own the sword which Parkes carried at Balaklava. The sword may have belonged to Parkes at some point in his military career, but it cannot be the one that he used on 25 October 1854 at Balaklava because the VC citation clearly states that Parkes was &quot;deprived of his sword with a shot&quot; and then taken prisoner. What is more, the 4th Light Dragoons had not at that point been equipped with the 1853 pattern light cavalry sabre. Parkes won his VC that day armed with an 1829 pattern light cavalry.

Parkes and Crawford were held as Russian prisoners until 26 October 1855 - which makes Parkes the very first prisoner of war VC. Joseph Grigg, who charged with the 4th Light Dragoons at Balaklava, in his article &quot;The Charge of the Six Hundred&quot; reports that &quot;Parks told us that he and some others were taken to St. Petersburg, where they were well treated, and allowed eight pence a day each for food, which was very cheap.&quot;

Bizarrely, the website of his own regiment&#x27;s museum undermines the validity of his award by stating &quot;While not detracting from Samuel Parkes’ valour in the charge, it should be remembered that the early awards of the V.C. were often made, not for the specific valour of the soldier, but because he was selected by his comrades. Parkes’ Victoria Cross may be considered as a representative award.&quot; Nothing supports such an erroneous claim. Although the original VC warrant allowed for awards by ballot for acts performed by a body of men, that provision was never used for any Crimean War VC. Rather, individual Crimean recommendations were made by commanding officers of individual regiments and then subject to rigorous consideration by a selection board of senior officers.

==Later life==
On leaving the army after 26 years 58 days reckonable service (i.e. excluding the period in gaol in 1848), he was appointed a warder at Hampton Court, with a pension of 1/1d as an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital. He subsequently became the Inspector of the Park Constables in Hyde Park. At one time he worked out of the constables&#x27; station inside Marble Arch.

He married Ann Jeffrey on 13 February 1858 at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London; their marriage certificate records that both were then living in Oxford Street. They had no children. As far as is known, he had not been married before.

Parkes was one of a number of Light Brigade survivors who in the spring of 1863 swore an affidavit in the celebrated libel case of Cardigan v Calthorpe. His evidence was one of 15 affidavits collected by Calthorpe, the defendant.

His discharge papers describe him as 6 ft 2 ins tall with a &quot;fair&quot; complexion, grey eyes and &quot;light&quot; hair.

Parkes was the oldest man to win the VC in the Crimean War and is the VC with the earliest campaign medal (Ghuznee 1839).

His death certificate records that he died of apoplexy. His death certificate shows his death was reported by John Sneezum. Was he the John Sneezum who had served as a Private with the 11th Hussars in the Crimean War (regimental number 1432), but probably did not charge at Balaclava? The surname is most unusual.

==Medals==
Parkes&#x27; Victoria Cross and other three medals were once owned by his regiment and displayed in their officers&#x27; mess (first the 4th Hussars, then the Queens Royal Irish Hussars and finally the Queens Royal Hussars. They sold them, however, to fund their new regimental museum in Trinity Mews, Priory Rd, Warwick CV34 4NA. The four medals are now in the Lord Ashcroft collection at the Imperial War Museum

The painting of his VC action by Chevalier Desanges is in the regimental museum. In total he was awarded: the Victoria Cross, the Ghuznee Medal, the British Crimean Medal with three clasps (Alma, Balaklava, Sebastopol) and the Turkish Crimean Medal (British variety).

The VC was bought at auction by the officers of the 4th Hussars and presented to the regiment on Balaklava Day 1954 to mark the centenary of the battle. There was once a second VC awarded to Parkes, a replacement following the &quot;loss&quot; (sale by him?) of his original. Bought at Sotheby&#x27;s on 21 December 1879 (lot 275) for £1-12s-0d by Viscount Dillon, he presented it to the Royal United Service Institute Museum c.1920. The subsequent story of his medals is itself complex. At what date either Parkes, or his family, lost or sold his medals is unknown - although in his regiment the story is that one evening, finding himself without money, he used his VC to pay for several pints of beer. The original VC presented by Queen Victoria in 1857 turned up in 1940 when it was sold in London. It was sold again in 1953 to an anonymous benefactor of the Royal Norfolk Regiment, together with Parkes&#x27; Ghuznee medal. He gave them both to their Museum but the Norfolks returned them so that they could be offered to the 4th Hussars - whose officers bought them at auction.

As for the duplicate, the RUSI Museum catalogue (1924 edition), states &quot;Experts have been consulted, but they are unable to say which, on comparing them, is the genuine one.&quot; On the closure of that Museum in 1963, &quot;the Green Howards Museum asked if there was a copy / replica V.C. which they could have as a sample medal. The R.U.S.I. allowed the regiment to have the copy of Parkes&#x27; V.C. on the strict understanding that on no account was it to be allowed to get onto the market and that when it ceased to be of use as a sample medal, it was to be destroyed, because it was not an original medal, but might have been sold as such by an unscrupulous person. These conditions have been complied with.&quot;

To complicate matters further, a second duplicate appears to have existed. When the 4th Hussars&#x27; officers bought the original in 1954, the regimental magazine states &quot; Pte. Parkes sold the original, but was given a duplicate which is also in our possession, and which has just been accepted by the Sandhurst Museum on loan from the Regiment.

Both Crimean medals (without the Ghuznee medal or a VC, real or copy), were sold at Sotheby&#x27;s (part of lot 110), for £3-18s-0d on 21 June 1906 - in a sale at which the Crimean campaign medals of another four Light Brigade men were also sold. Both were sold again at Glendinings (lot 16), on 12 March 1907, for £2-8s-0d and reappeared in their sale rooms twice more, on both occasions with a copy of a VC: on 27 March 1914 (lot 246), when they made £6-15s-0d and on 23 January 1920 (lot 304) when they went for £3-7s-6d. These are presumably the two Crimean medals that in the mid-1950s were somehow reunited with Parkes&#x27; Ghuznee medal and his VC and sold to the 4th Hussars. But a second British Crimean campaign medal with three bars named to Parkes exists - it was shown to Sotheby&#x27;s and verified by them as genuine in 1972/73.

The 4th Light Dragoons&#x27; regimental returns in the Crimean Medal Roll [PRO, WO 100/24] show Parkes&#x27; entitlement to the clasp for Alma (at f.203 recto) while there is a dash against Inkerman, noting he had been taken prisoner on 25 October. His entitlement to the Balaklava bar is recorded on folio 228 recto. But his name does not appear in the list of those entitled to the Sebastopol clasp (folios 216 recto to 225 recto) - though this was an automatic award for those who had been at Inkermann and/or Balaklava.

==Pictures==

No photograph of Samuel Parkes is known to exist (unless, by sheer chance, he is one of the privates of the 4th Light Dragoons who appear in a photograph taken at the Cavalry Barracks at Brighton c.1853-54, illustrated in Wilkinson-Latham, no.27 p. 35).

The oil painting by the Chevalier Louis Desanges may be a fair and genuine likeness. Between 1857 and 1862, Desanges painted 50 VC winners. Of those, some 23 were Crimean VC winners, but only four of those depicted in the series were rankers. Depicting acts of saving the lives of other soldiers is the common thread explaining why these individual VC winners were picked out for commemoration in the series of paintings, but Samuel Parkes is the only one of the entire 50 to illustrate a ranker saving another ranker, as opposed to a ranker saving an officer. The set of VC paintings were displayed at the Crystal Palace from 1862 to c.1880. They were then bought by Lord Wantage VC who presented them to the Wantage town council in 1900. Later, the collection was dispersed, many being bought by regimental museums. The portraits were widely reproduced as postcards and photographs. The Desanges portrait is reproduced in M. Barthorp, &quot;Heroes of the Crimea. The Battles of Balaklava &amp; Inkerman.&quot; (Blandford, London, 1991), p. 132 and in colour in Elkin, &quot;Tamworth&#x27;s Forgotten Hero.&quot;, p. 145.

Parkes also appears in the watercolour &#x27;The Queen distributing the first Victoria Crosses in Hyde Park, 26 June 1857&#x27; by G H Thomas that is in the British royal collection. Not much of him can be seen at the very far left, but he is shown (correctly) wearing the newly introduced dragoon uniform. This painting is reproduced in Elkin, &quot;Tamworth&#x27;s Forgotten Hero.&quot;, p. 44.

VC winners were a popular subject for postcards and cigarette cards, but none showing Parkes is accurate, e.g. a John Player &amp; Sons cigarette card from their 1914 series &#x27;Victoria Cross&#x27; (card no.5) shows him winning his VC still mounted on his horse. The coloured Raphael Tuck oilette postcard (number 9247; artist = H. Montague Love, 1905) in their series &#x27;How he won the Victoria Cross&#x27; is an even more fanciful depiction of Parkes, showing him dressed in the uniform of a hussar and saving a lancer. This card is reproduced in Elkin, &quot;Tamworth&#x27;s Forgotten Hero.&quot;, p. 143. At least Valentine&#x27;s &quot;Artotype&quot; series &#x27;The King&#x27;s Army, 1854&#x27; (artist R. Stewart) showed the 4th at Balaklava dressed correctly as dragoons with the right regimental facings, even if the caption called them the 4th Hussars.

<text>The Bundschuh movement (German: &quot;Bundschuh-Bewegung&quot;) refers to a series of localized peasant rebellions in southwestern Germany from 1493 to 1517. They were one of the causes of the German Peasants&#x27; War (1524–1525). The Bundschuh movement was not a movement in the proper sense, but a number of loosely linked local conspiracies and planned uprisings. It was so called because of the tied peasant shoe (&quot;Bundschuh&quot;) the peasants displayed on their flag. Under this flag, peasants and city dwellers had defeated the troops of the French count of Armagnac along the Upper Rhine in 1439, 1443, and 1444.

Individual uprisings – seeking relief from oppressive taxes, arbitrary justice systems, high debts, costly ecclesiastic privileges, serfdom, prohibitions on hunting and fishing, and the like – occurred in 1476 in Niklashausen (Tauber valley), 1493 in Schlettstadt (now Sélestat)/Alsace, for the first time under the Bundschuh banner), 1502 in Bruchsal and Untergrombach, 1513 in Lehen (Breisgau), and 1517 along the Upper Rhine. Each of these was defeated very quickly, and the leaders, such as Joß Fritz, were generally executed.

== &quot;Bundschuh&quot; ==
As a sign displayed on their flag the peasants chose the &quot;Bundschuh&quot; (=tied shoe), a leather shoe typical of peasants. It was to symbolise the joint rising and advance of the peasants against their lords. It also contrasted the boots worn by knights with their spurs.

<text>Michelle McAdorey is a Canadian singer-songwriter based in Toronto, Ontario. She was a member of the 1990s band Crash Vegas, and now performs and records as a solo artist.

==Early life==
McAdorey was born in Toronto. She is the niece of Canadian television personality Bob McAdorey.

==Career==
In the early 1980s, McAdorey lived in the United Kingdom, where she was briefly a backup singer for Kirsty MacColl, singing on MacColl&#x27;s 1981 record &quot;Desperate Character&quot;, where she was credited as Blanche McAdorey. While there, she joined a new wave band called Cold Fish. CBS Canada released the record and changed the name of the band to Corect Spelling without the band&#x27;s consent. Although the band received widespread exposure for their debut single, &quot;Love Me Today&quot;, produced by Midge Ure, the band broke up after receiving poor support from their label.

McAdorey eventually moved back to Toronto, where she wrote songs with Blue Rodeo&#x27;s Greg Keelor, and appeared in the video for Blue Rodeo&#x27;s hit single &quot;Try&quot;.

McAdorey and Keelor later formed the band Crash Vegas; they recruited Jocelyne Lanois and drummer Ambrose Pottie to complete the group. Some of the songs she had written with Keelor were included in that band&#x27;s 1990 debut album, &quot;Red Earth&quot;. McAdorey was awarded the 1990 Socan Songwriter of the year award for the song &quot;Inside Out&quot; off of the album Red Earth. Crash Vegas was also nominated for a Juno in the same year. Crash Vegas went on to release two more albums, &quot;Stone&quot; in 1993, for which McAdorey was the main songwriter, and &quot;Aurora&quot; in 1995.

Crash Vegas disbanded in 1996. In 2000, McAdorey released her solo debut, &quot;Whirl&quot;. The same year, she appeared on King Cobb Steelie&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Mayday&quot;, co-writing and lending her vocals to the title track. In 2003 McAdorey released &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Change&quot; with Eric Chenaux. The two had played together for years and this recording was a document of their live playing to date. In 2013 McAdorey released a single on Peterborough label Seventh Fire as part of a limited edition 7&quot; vinyl club.

Her latest solo album, &quot;Into Her Future&quot;, was released on 30 October 2015 via DWR, and was longlisted for the 2016 Polaris Music Prize. The album appeared on the !earshot National Top 50 Chart in December that year. McAdorey&#x27;s album &quot;Into Her Future&quot; was included in many critics&#x27; Top 10 Year End Lists.

<text>Elastic cartilage, fibroelastic cartilage or yellow fibrocartilage is a type of cartilage present in the pinnae (auricles) of the ear giving it shape, provides shape for the lateral region of the external auditory meatus, medial part of the auditory canal Eustachian tube, corniculate and cuneiform laryneal cartilages, and the epiglottis. It contains elastic fiber networks and collagen type II fibers. The principal protein is elastin.

==Structure==
Elastic cartilage is histologically similar to hyaline cartilage but contains many yellow elastic fibers lying in a solid matrix. These fibers form bundles that appear dark under a microscope. The elastic fibers require special staining since when it is stained using haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain it appears the same as hyaline cartilage. Verhoeff van Geison stains are used (giving the elastic fibers a black color), but aldehyde fuchsin stains, Weigert&#x27;s elastic stains, and orcein stains also work. These fibers give elastic cartilage great flexibility so that it is able to withstand repeated bending. Similarly to hyaline one or multiple chondrocytes lie between the spaces (or lacunea) in the fibres. The chondrocytes only make up 2% of the tissue&#x27;s volume. Chondrocytes and the extracellular matrix are contained in an outerlayer named the perichondrium (which is a layer of dense irregular connective tissue that surrounds cartilage which is independent of the joint). It is found in the epiglottis (part of the larynx), and the pinnae (the external ear flaps of many mammals). Elastin fibers stain dark purple/black with Verhoeff&#x27;s stain.

The extracellular matrix contains Elastin, fibrillin, glycoproteins, collagen types II, IX, X, and XI, and the proteoglycan aggrecan. the components within the extracellular matrix are produced by the chondroblasts located within the edges of the perichondrium. 

Elastic fibers within the extracellular matrix are made up of elastin proteins which co-polymerize with fibrillin forming fiber-like elastic chains. When the elastic fibers are relaxed the elastic chains appear disorganized, when tensile pressure is give the elastic chains appear organized and return to a disorganized state when the pressure is released.

Collagen fibers form networks to provide strength and structural framework for the molecules within the extracellular matrix.

==Function==
* Provide support
* Maintain shape in response to tension, compression, and bending

<text>In the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotive wheel arrangement, a 2-6-6-4 is a locomotive with a two-wheel leading truck, two sets of six driving wheels, and a four-wheel trailing truck. All 2-6-6-4s are simple articulated locomotives.

Other equivalent classifications are:
*UIC classification: (1&#x27;C)C2″ (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
*French classification: 130+032
*Turkish classification: 34+35
*Swiss classification: 3/4+3/5

The UIC classification is refined to (1&#x27;C)C2″ for simple articulated locomotives.

The 2-6-6-4 was a fairly late development, a product of the superpower steam concept, introduced by the Lima Locomotive Works, which encouraged the use of large fireboxes supported by four-wheel trailing trucks. Such a firebox could sustain a rate of steam generation to meet any demands of the locomotive&#x27;s cylinders, even at high speed. High speeds were certainly among the design goals for the 2-6-6-4; most of the type were intended for use on fast freight trains.

The first 2-6-6-4s built in the United States were for the Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railroad, and these were not high-speed locomotives but rather mountain engines. They received three in 1934 and four more in 1937 and operated the 2-6-6-4s until 1953. 

The next of the type was a class of ten ordered by the Seaboard Air Line in 1935 and 1937. These were high-speed freight engines and very successful. Upon dieselization the class was sold to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1947, who operated them until 1953.

The final class of 2-6-6-4s was the Norfolk and Western Railway&#x27;s A class, built starting in 1936. 43 were built until 1950 but were operated until 1959 to prepare the ending of steam power. The powerful 2-6-6-4s were capable of more than 5,000 drawbar horsepower at and could reach , while pulling heavy coal trains. They were used until dieselization in 1959.

In all, sixty 2-6-6-4s were constructed in North America. Only one remains: Norfolk and Western 1218 was preserved and in 1987 was restored to running order, running on excursions until 1991. Today it is on display at the Virginia Museum of Transportation.

<text>Allastair Malcolm Cluny McReady-Diarmid VC (21 March 1888 – 1 December 1917) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 29 years old, and an Acting Captain in the 17th (S) Battalion, The Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 30 November/1 December 1917 at the Moeuvres Sector, France, when the enemy penetrated into our position, and the situation was extremely critical, Captain McReady-Diarmid led his company through a heavy barrage and immediately engaged the enemy and drove them back at least 300 yards, causing numerous casualties and taking 27 prisoners. The following day the enemy again attacked and drove back another company which had lost all its officers. The captain called for volunteers, and leading the attack, again drove them back. It was entirely due to his throwing of bombs that the ground was regained, but he was eventually killed by a bomb.

He is commemorated on the Cambrai Memorial to the Missing.

==Further information==
As a boy, McReady-Diarmid went to Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School for Boys, Barnet, Hertfordshire. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum, Chelsea, England.

Albert and Leopold were the younger brothers of Duke Rudolf IV of Austria, who upon the death of his father Duke Albert II in 1358 had assumed the rule not only over the Austrian duchy, but also over the Duchy of Styria, ruled in personal union with Austria according to the 1186 Georgenberg Pact, and over the Duchy of Carinthia with the adjacent March of Carniola.

Rudolf, an energetic monarch struggling with the rivalling Wittelsbach and Luxembourg dynasties, immediately elevated himself to an Austrian archduke by the &quot;Privilegium Maius&quot;. In 1363 he acquired the County of Tyrol from the last Meinhardiner countess Margaret and the next year added &quot;Duke of Carniola&quot; to his titles. Upon his early death in 1365, his brothers inherited a significant cluster of Imperial States stretching from the Habsburg residence Vienna to the dynasty&#x27;s original Further Austrian possessions in the west, the nucleus of the Habsburg monarchy.

==Terms==
Rudolf had decreed the joint rule of his younger brothers by house law (&quot;Rudolfinische Hausordnung&quot;) in 1364. However, they fell out with each other soon after his death. On 9 September 1379 a partition treaty was signed in Neuberg Abbey in Styria:
* Albert and his descendants (Albertinian line, extinct in 1457) retained the Archduchy of Austria proper, i.e. later Upper and Lower Austria, including the Traungau and Salzkammergut;
* Leopold and his descendants (Leopoldian line) became the exclusive ruler of Styria (then including Pitten and the town of Wiener Neustadt), Carinthia, Carniola (enlarged by the Windic march and territory in the March of Istria since 1374), Tyrol and Further Austria, as well as Trieste and acquisitions in Friuli (the latter were annexed to Carniola). 
Regardless of their territories, all Habsburg rulers would retain the Austrian archducal title.

==Aftermath==

Under Leopold&#x27;s sons, the Leopoldian possessions were further subdivided into Inner Austria (i.e. Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, and Littoral) and (not to be confused with the present-day Austrian federal state), comprising Tyrol and the Further Austrian lands, from 1406 ruled by Leopold&#x27;s youngest son Duke Frederick IV.

The split between the Albertinian and Leopoldinian lines of the Habsburg family and the Austrian lands enfeebled the dynasty&#x27;s position. The Albertinian archduke Albert V of Austria was elected King of the Romans in 1438. Nevertheless, he died one year later and the line finally became extinct by the death of his son Ladislaus the Posthumous in 1457. The territories were inherited by the Leopoldian archduke Frederick V of Inner Austria, Albert&#x27;s successor as King of the Romans and from 1452 also Holy Roman Emperor. Finally, in 1490, all Habsburg territories were reunified, when Archduke Sigismund handed over the rulership of Tyrol and Further Austria (&#x27;Upper Austria&#x27;) to Emperor Frederick&#x27;s son King Maximilian I.

<text>The Anglo-Turkish War of 1807–1809 was a part of the Napoleonic Wars, was fought between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Ottoman Empire.

==Ultimatum==
In the summer of 1806, during the War of the Third Coalition (of Great Britain, Russia, Austria, Sweden), Napoleon&#x27;s ambassador General Count Sebastiani managed to convince the Porte (the central government of the Ottoman Empire) to cancel all special privileges granted to Russia in 1805 and to open the Ottoman straits (the Dardanelles) exclusively to French warships. In return, Napoleon promised to help the Sultan suppress the rebellion in Serbia and to recover lost territories. When the Russian army marched into Moldavia and Wallachia in 1806, the Ottomans declared war on Russia.

==Dardanelles operation==

In September 1806, the British government pressured Sultan Selim III to expel Sebastiani, declare war on France, cede the Danubian Principalities to Russia, and surrender the Ottoman fleet, together with the forts on the Dardanelles, to the Royal Navy. After Selim&#x27;s rejection of the ultimatum, a British squadron under Vice Admiral John Thomas Duckworth entered the Dardanelles on 19 February 1807 and destroyed an Ottoman naval force in the Sea of Marmara, and anchored opposite Constantinople. With French assistance the Ottomans erected powerful batteries and strengthened their fortifications. The British warships were cannonaded suffering the loss of two ships. Duckworth made the decision to withdraw to the Mediterranean on 3 March 1807.

==Alexandria expedition of 1807==

On 16 March 1807, 6,000 British troops embarked for Alexandria in Ottoman Egypt, which they captured in August. Governor Muhammad Ali mounted effective counter-attacks and a lack of supplies forced the British to withdraw. The Ottoman Empire had little military support from France due to the war with Russia; Napoleon failed to secure Russia&#x27;s compliance with the armistice agreement of 1807 with Britain, which was now at war with both France and Russia.
== Treaty of the Dardanelles ==
On January 5, 1809, the Treaty of the Dardanelles was concluded on board a British ship , ending the war.

<doc id="1220203" wikidata="Q267293" url="?curid=1220203" title="Dunshaughlin">
<text>Dunshaughlin ( or locally ) is a town in County Meath, Ireland. A commuter town for nearby Dublin, Dunshaughlin more than tripled in population (from 2,139 to 6,644 inhabitants) between the 1996 and 2022 censuses. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

==History==
===Foundation===

Dunshaughlin is named for Saint Seachnall, who established a church there in the 5th century, where he is said to be buried. The oldest reference to the place name is an entry in the &quot;Annála Uladh&quot; from the year 801, where the name takes the form &quot;Domnaig Sechnaill&quot;. The word &quot;Domnach&quot;, used in this way, can be attributed to churches which originate from the beginnings of Christianity in Ireland. North of the ruins of the original church, on the site, there is a Church of Ireland church built in 1814 with funds from the Board of First Fruits. 

Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill was an ancestor from which the principal family of Brega, Ó Maoilsheachlainn, is descended. Dunshaughlin (or more specifically, the townland of Lagore) is famous for an ancient crannóg or settlement from the 7th century where a number of Irish antiquities were discovered.

===Workhouse===
Approximately from the village is a preserved workhouse from the Great Famine. This workhouse was erected in 1840–41 on , south of Dunshaughlin. Designed to accommodate 400 inmates, it cost about £6,000 to build, all told. It was declared fit for habitation on 12 May 1841 and received its first admissions on 17 May. During the famine period, in the mid-1840s, elements of the workhouse were converted to accommodate additional inmates, and a burial ground was located to the rear. Occupancy declined after the famine. During the First World War, the building was used to house Belgian refugees, some of whom died there and were buried in the paupers&#x27; graveyard. In 1920–21, the building was taken over by the Black and Tans, who used it as a barracks during the Irish War of Independence. After the workhouse system was abolished in 1922, following the conclusion of the war and the establishment of the Irish Free State, the facility served as a school, courthouse, and factory (among other things). As of 2002, parts of the building were being used as a guest residence.

==Demographics==
Dunshaughlin is 29 km from Dublin on the R147, and is a growing satellite town of that city. In the 20 years between the 1991 and 2011 census, the town&#x27;s population had more than tripled from 1,275 inhabitants to 3,903 people. By the time of the 2022 census, this had further increased to 6,644.

==Amenities==
Several housing estates centre on the main street, with multiple retail units consisting of newsagents, pubs, takeaway food outlets, clothing stores, and banks. There is also a business park on the outskirts of the town.

Dunshaughlin houses a number of public amenities, including a library, a health centre, and the Meath County Council civic offices. A community and sports centre was opened on the grounds of Dunshaughlin Community College in 2000. The centre is operated by a voluntary board of management.

==Education==
Dunshaughlin has three primary schools, Gaelscoil na Ríthe, St. Seachnall&#x27;s and Dunshaughlin Community National School. It has two secondary schools, Dunshaughlin Community College and Coláiste Ríoga.
St. Seachnall&#x27;s was founded in 1835. As of 2019, it had 552 students, both boys and girls. Gaelscoil na Ríthe (an Irish medium school) was established in 1985 by a group of parents from the Dunshaughlin, Drumree, and Culmullen areas. A new building was constructed in 1996 and, as of 2019, the school had an enrollment of 226 pupils. Dunshaughlin Community College (DCC), established in 1933, is a co-educational school which is part of the Louth and Meath Education and Training Board. Construction was completed on an extension to the school in 2013, and was officially opened on 29 November 2014.

==Transport==
Dunshaughlin is located at a junction between the R147 and R125 regional roads, approximately 1 km from the M3 motorway. It is served by Bus Éireann commuter bus services to Dublin, including route 109, which generally runs at a frequency of every half-hour.

==Sport==

The town is represented in sport by men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Gaelic football teams. The Dunshaughlin GAA men&#x27;s team were Meath Senior Football Championship for three consecutive seasons (2000 to 2003). The local soccer club, Dunshaughlin Youths, fields teams in the North Dublin Schoolboy&#x27;s League.

The local basketball club, Dunshaughlin Rockets, compete in both the North East Basketball League and the Dublin Ladies Basketball League. Dunshaughlin Community College has won a girl&#x27;s under 16&#x27;s All-Ireland title, a second-year girl&#x27;s All-Ireland and a boy&#x27;s under 19&#x27;s All-Ireland title.

Dunshaughlin Athletic Club is traditionally considered a long-distance running club. However, club members have also entered juvenile sprinting competitions. The town&#x27;s golf course is the &quot;Black Bush Golf Club&quot;. Around outside the village, a new golfing resort designed by Jack Nicklaus has been created at Killeen Castle. The course hosted the 2011 Solheim Cup.

The town also has a strong association with horse racing, in particular National Hunt racing. The leading flat race sprinter Sole Power, dual winner of both the Nunthorpe Stakes and the King&#x27;s Stand Stakes, is trained near the town by Edward Lynam.

==Events==
The Dunshaughlin Harvest Festival is a three-day culture festival, usually taking place towards the end of September. It is a non-profit event, organized and run by local volunteers.

<text>Thomas Harold Broadbent Maufe VC (6 May 1898 – 28 March 1942) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was educated at Uppingham School.

==VC details==
He was 19 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 124th Siege Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 4 June 1917 at Feuchy, France, Second Lieutenant Maufe, on his own initiative and under intense artillery fire repaired, unaided, the telephone wire between the forward and rear positions, thereby enabling his battery to open fire on the enemy. He also saved what could have been a disastrous occurrence by extinguishing a fire in an advanced ammunition dump caused by a heavy explosion, regardless of the risk he ran from the effects of gas shells in the dump.

==Further information==
By the end of the war he had achieved the rank of major, one of the youngest to hold that rank. After the war Maufe completed his interrupted education at Clare College, Cambridge and the Royal School of Mines where he was a member of The Chaps Club.

Maufe served in the Home Guard as a volunteer during World War II in 28th West Riding (Otley) Bn. He was killed in an accident with a misfiring trench mortar during training at the age of 43 on 28 March 1942 near Ilkley. He is buried in Ilkley Cemetery.

Maufe&#x27;s name is listed on a war memorial on the gates of his former prep school, Nevill Holt, near the village of Medbourne, Leicestershire, along with other casualties of the world wars.

==Family==
He was the son of Frederick Broadbent and Helen Mann Maufe, of Warlbeck, Ilkley, West Yorkshire. He married Mary Gwendolen Carr.

The family name was originally Muff but was changed to Maufe in 1909. The family part-owned the Bradford department store Brown Muff &amp; Co.In response to their rising fortunes they left Bradford and changed their name to Maufe, thereby inspiring the local ditty: &quot;In Bradford &#x27;tis good enoof/To be known as Mrs Muff/But in Ilkley by the river Wharfe/&#x27;Tis better to be known as Mrs Maufe!&quot;

He was a cousin of the architect Edward Maufe

<doc id="1220214" wikidata="Q242358" url="?curid=1220214" title="American lion">
<text>The American lion (Panthera atrox (), with the species name meaning &quot;savage&quot; or &quot;cruel&quot;, also called the North American lion) is an extinct pantherine cat native to North America during the Late Pleistocene from around 130,000 to 12,800 years ago. Genetic evidence suggests that its closest living relative is the lion (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;), with the American lion representing an offshoot from the lineage of the largely Eurasian cave lion (&quot;Panthera spelaea&quot;), from which it is suggested to have split around 165,000 years ago. Its fossils have been found across North America, from Canada to Mexico. It was about 25% larger than the modern lion, making it one of the largest known felids to ever exist, and a dominant apex predator in North American ecosystems, alongside the sabertooth cats &quot;Smilodon&quot; and &quot;Homotherium&quot;. It has been suggested, like modern lions, they were social animals, although this is not known for sure.

The American lion became extinct as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event along with most other large animals across the Americas. The extinctions followed human arrival in the Americas. Proposed factors in its extinction include climatic change reducing viable habitat, as well as human hunting of herbivore prey causing a trophic cascade.

== History and taxonomy ==
=== Initial discovery and North American fossils ===

The first specimen now assigned to &quot;Panthera atrox&quot; was collected in the 1830s by William Henry Huntington, Esq., who announced his discovery to the American Philosophical Society on April 1, 1836 and placed it with other fossils from Huntington&#x27;s collection in the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. The specimen had been collected in ravines in Natchez, Mississippi that were dated to the Pleistocene; the specimen consisted only of a partial left mandible with 3 molars and a partial canine. The fossils did not get a proper description until 1853 when Joseph Leidy named the fragmentary specimen (ANSP 12546) &quot;Felis atrox&quot; (&quot;savage cat&quot;). Leidy named another species in 1873, &quot;Felis imperialis&quot;, based on a mandible fragment from Pleistocene gravels in Livermore Valley, California. &quot;F. imperialis&quot; however is considered a junior synonym of &quot;Panthera atrox&quot;. A replica of the jaw of the first American lion specimen to be discovered can be seen in the hand of a statue of famous paleontologist Joseph Leidy, currently standing outside the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.

Few additional discoveries came until 1907, when the American Museum of Natural History and College, Alaska collected several &quot;Panthera atrox&quot; skulls in a locality originally found in 1803 by gold miners in Kotzebue, Alaska. The skulls were referred to a new subspecies of &quot;Felis&quot; (&quot;Panthera&quot;) &quot;atrox&quot; in 1930, &quot;Felis atrox&quot; &quot;alaskensis&quot;&quot;.&quot; Despite this, the species did not get a proper description and is now seen as a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; synonymous with &quot;Panthera atrox&quot;. Further south in Rancho La Brea, California, a large felid skull was excavated and later described in 1909 by John C. Merriam, who referred it to a new subspecies of &quot;Felis atrox&quot;, &quot;Felis atrox bebbi&quot;. The subspecies is synonymous with &quot;Panthera atrox.&quot;

Throughout the early to mid 1900s, dozens of fossils of &quot;Panthera atrox&quot; were excavated at La Brea, including many postcranial elements and associated skeletons. The fossils were described by Merriam &amp; Stock in detail in 1932, who synonymized many previously named taxa with &quot;Felis atrox.&quot; At least 80 individuals are known from La Brea Tar Pits and the fossils define the subspecies, giving a comprehensive view of the taxon. It was not until 1941 that George Simpson moved &quot;Felis atrox&quot; to &quot;Panthera&quot;, believing that it was a subspecies of jaguar. Simpson also referred several fossils from central Mexico, even as far south as Chiapas, as well as Nebraska and other regions of the western US, to &quot;P. atrox&quot;. 1971 witnessed the description of fragmentary remains from Alberta, Canada that extended &quot;P. atrox&quot;″s range north. In 2009, an entrapment site at Natural Trap Cave, Wyoming was briefly described and is the second most productive &quot;Panthera atrox&quot;-bearing fossil site. It most importantly contains well-preserved mitochondrial DNA of many partial skeletons.

=== &quot;Panthera onca mesembrina&quot; and possible South American material ===
In the 1890s in the &quot;Cueva del Milodon&quot; in southern Chile, fossil collector Rodolfo Hauthal collected a fragmentary postcranial skeleton of a large felid that he sent to Santiago Roth. Roth described them as a new genus and species of felid, &quot;Iemish listai&quot; in 1899. However, the name is considered a nomen nudum. In 1904, Roth reassessed the phylogenetic affinities of &quot;Iemish&quot; and named it &quot;Felis listai&quot; and referred several cranial and fragmentary postcranial elements to the taxon. Notably, several mandibles, a partial skull, and pieces of skin were some of the specimens referred. In 1934, &quot;Felis onca mesembrina&quot; was named by Angel Cabrera based on that partial skull from &quot;Cueva del Milodon&quot; and the other material from the site was referred to it. The skull (MLP 10-90) was lost, and was only illustrated by Cabrera.

Further material, including feces and mandibles, was referred to as &quot;F. onca mesembrina&quot; from Tierra del Fuego, Argentina and other southern sites in Chile.

In 2016, the subspecies was referred to &quot;Panthera onca&quot; in a genetic study, which supported its identity as a subspecies of jaguar. Later in 2017, one study synoymised &quot;P. onca mesembrina&quot; with &quot;Panthera atrox&quot; based on morphological similarities, though this does not have broad acceptance.

=== Evolution ===

The American lion was initially considered a distinct species of Pantherinae, and designated as &quot;Panthera atrox&quot;, which means &quot;cruel&quot; or &quot;fearsome panther&quot; in Latin. Some paleontologists accepted this view, but others considered it to be a type of lion closely related to the modern lion (&quot;Panthera&quot; &quot;leo&quot;) and its extinct relative, the Eurasian cave lion (&quot;Panthera leo spelaea&quot; or &quot;P. spelaea&quot;). It was later assigned as a subspecies of &quot;P. leo&quot; (&quot;P. leo atrox&quot;) rather than as a separate species. Most recently, both &quot;spelaea&quot; and &quot;atrox&quot; have been treated as full species.

Cladistic studies using morphological characteristics have been unable to resolve the phylogenetic position of the American lion. One study considered the American lion, along with the cave lion, to be most closely related to the tiger (&quot;Panthera tigris)&quot;, citing a comparison of the skull; the braincase, in particular, appears to be especially similar to the braincase of a tiger. Another study suggested that the American lion and the Eurasian cave lion were successive offshoots of a lineage leading to a clade which includes modern leopards and lions. A more recent study comparing the skull and jaw of the American lion with other pantherines concluded that it was not a lion but a distinct species. It was proposed that it arose from pantherines that migrated to North America during the mid-Pleistocene and gave rise to American lions and jaguars (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;). Another study grouped the American lion with &quot;P. leo&quot; and &quot;P. tigris&quot;, and ascribed morphological similarities to &quot;P. onca&quot; to convergent evolution, rather than phylogenetic affinity.

Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from fossil remains suggests that the American lion (&quot;P. atrox&quot;) represents a sister lineage to Late Pleistocene populations of the Eurasian cave lion (&quot;P. spelaea&quot;), and likely arose when an early cave lion population became isolated south of the North American continental ice sheet. While initial studies suggested that the divergence between American and Eurasian cave lions took place around 340,000 years ago, later studies suggested that the split took place considerably later, around 165,000 years ago, consistent with the earliest appearance of cave lions in eastern Beringia (now Alaska) during the Illinoian (190-130,000 years ago). 

Genetic studies indicate that the living lion is the closest living relative of &quot;P. atrox&quot; and &quot;P. spelaea&quot;. Genome-wide sequencing of modern lions and Eurasian cave lions suggests that the lineage of the cave lion and American lion diverged from that of the modern lion around 500,000 years ago.

== Description ==
The American lion is estimated to have measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail and stood at the shoulder. &quot;Panthera atrox&quot; was sexually dimorphic, with an approximate range of between 235kg to 523 kg (518lbs-1153lbs) in males and 175kg to 365 kg (385lbs-805lbs) for females. A separate study found American lions were more sexually dimorphic than modern lions in terms of size: American lion males being 1.4 times larger than females, compared to modern male lions being 1.26 times larger. In 2008, the American lion was estimated to weigh up to . A study in 2009 showed an average weight of for males and for the largest specimen analyzed. 
&quot;Panthera atrox&quot; had limb bones more robust than those of an African lion, and comparable in robustness to the bones of a brown bear; also its limbs were 10% longer than extant African lion in relation to skull length. About 80 American lion individuals have been recovered from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, so their morphology is well known. Their features strongly resemble those of modern lions, but they were considerably larger, similar to &quot;P. spelaea&quot; and the Pleistocene Natodomeri lion of eastern Africa.

Preserved skin remains found with skeletal material considered by some to belong to the American lion found in caves in Patagonia is reddish in colour, though the attribution of Patagonian &quot;Panthera&quot; remains to &quot;P. atrox&quot; is highly controversial and not accepted by many authors. Preserved fur of the closely related &quot;P. spelaea&quot; found in Siberia is yellowish in colour, with cave art of European &quot;P. spelaea&quot; indicating that males lacked substantial manes unlike modern lions. These characteristics may also apply to &quot;P. atrox&quot;.

== Distribution ==
The earliest lions known in the Americas south of Alaska are from the Sangamonian Stage (equivalent to the global Last Interglacial ~130-115,000 years ago) during which American lions rapidly dispersed across North America, with their distribution ultimately ranging from Canada to southern Mexico and from California to the Atlantic coast. It was generally not found in the same areas as the jaguar, which favored forests over open habitats. It was absent from eastern Canada and the northeastern United States, perhaps due to the presence of dense boreal forests in the region. Farther south, fossilised remains of the American lion have been discovered in Extinction Cave, Belize. Fossils of the American lion have also been unearthed in Peru. The American lion was formerly believed to have colonized northwestern South America as part of the Great American Interchange. However, the fossil remains found in the tar pits of Talara, Peru actually belong to an unusually large jaguar. On the other hand, fossils of a large felid from late Pleistocene localities in southern Chile and Argentina traditionally identified as an extinct subspecies of jaguar, &quot;Panthera onca mesembrina&quot;, have been considered by some authors actually represent remains of the American lion, though this interpretation is highly controversial, with many authors favouring a jaguar attribution for these remains.

The American lion is believed to have inhabited savannas and grasslands like the modern lion. Isotopic analysis suggests that American lions also inhabited forests and areas with sparse tree coverings, suggesting this species lived in a wide variety of environments.

== Paleobiology ==
=== Predatory behavior ===
American lions likely preyed on deer, horses, camels, tapirs, American bison, mammoths, and other large ungulates (hoofed mammals). Paired nitrogen and carbon isotopic evidence from Natural Trap Cave in Wyoming reveals that the extant pronghorn was an important food source for American lions, which probably hunted them regularly, although probably also could be due to kleptoparasitism from the kills of &quot;Miracinonyx&quot; (sometimes called the &quot;American cheetah&quot;). In San Luis Potosí, American lions preyed on C4 mixed feeders such as bisons, proghorns, horses and mammoths. At La Brea tar pits, recent isotopic analysis suggests that American lions preferred forested-dwelling prey much like the contemporary &quot;S. fatalis&quot;.

Analyses of dental microwear suggest that the American lion actively avoided bone just like the modern cheetah (more so than &quot;Smilodon&quot;). &quot;Panthera atrox&quot; has the highest proportion of canine breakage in La Brea, suggesting a consistent preference for larger prey than contemporary carnivores. Dental microwear additionally suggests that carcass utilization slightly declined over time (~30,000 BP to 11,000 radiocarbon BP) in &quot;Panthera atrox&quot;. The fragment of a femur from a gray wolf from the La Brea Tar Pits shows evidence of a violent bite which possibly amputated the leg. Researchers believe that &quot;Panthera atrox&quot; is a prime candidate for the injury, due to its bite force and bone shearing ability. Based on skull width, it is estimated that a 347 kilogram American lion would have a bite force of 2,830 newtons.

=== Social behavior ===

Whether American lion were gregarious like modern lions or lived solitary lives like tigers is unknown. American lions likely descended from &quot;Panthera spelaea&quot;, which was possibly a solitary animal, based on fossil evidence and several isotopic studies. Whether this would apply to American lion is unclear.

Yamaguchi et al. argues gregariousness in American lions because of their similar sexual dimorphism seen in modern lions. However, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco, in their 2002 paper, warned that high levels of sexual dimorphism isn’t a reliable way to determine group behavior. Wheeler and Jefferson suggests American lion probably lived in prides like modern lions due to the large amounts of young males at dispersal age and low number of young females found at the tar pits. They argued that female American lions were less likely to end up in the tar pits because they were more likely to remain in their natural prides in the youngest pits between 14 and 11 kya. However, the authors of the paper admit small sample size of remains prior to 14 kya does not support or refute evidence of forming prides. In their 2009 study, Christiansen and Harris suggested American lions were solitary because it wasn’t part of the lion lineage. 

Some scientists suggested if American lions were gregarious, they likely had a larger brain to body mass than to solitary predators found at the La Brea tar pits. However, studies have shown there’s no correlation in brain size to sociality in big cats.

The remains of American lions are not as abundant as those of other predators like &quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot; or dire wolves (&quot;Aenocyon dirus&quot;) at the La Brea Tar Pits. This may suggests that they were better at evading entrapment, possibly due to greater intelligence. But considering the abundance of the seemingly intelligent dire wolf at the tar pits calls this hypothesis into question.

Despite its rarity, the high ratio of juveniles to adults recovered at the tar pits would suggest possible gregariousness in &quot;Panthera atrox&quot;. But its rarity in the tar pits would suggests that it was possibly more solitary than &quot;Smilodon&quot; and &quot;Aenocyon&quot; or was gregarious but lived in low densities similar to African wild dogs. 

Like their modern relatives, based on the nature of their hyoid bones, they may have been capable of roaring.

== Extinction ==

The American lion went extinct as part of the end-Pleistocene extinctions around 13-12,000 years ago, approximately simultaneously with most large (megafaunal) mammals across the Americas. The most recent fossil, from Edmonton, Canada dates to ~12,877 calibrated years Before Present, and is 400 years younger than the youngest cave lion in Alaska. These extinctions post-date human arrival to the Americas. The causes of the extinctions have been long the subject of controversy, with most authors positing climate change, humans or some combination of the two as the causes of the extinctions. A 2017 study suggested that the viable habitat for the American lion in North America had been greatly reduced over the course of the Last Glacial Period, which would have made it more vulnerable to extinction. Other authors have suggested that the extinction of the American lion and other competing carnivores like dire wolves, and the sabertooth cats &quot;Smilodon&quot; and &quot;Homotherium&quot; may have been due to trophic cascade effects caused by Paleoindian hunting of herbivores. These authors suggested that the herbivores already probably existed at low population numbers prior to Paleoindian arrival due to their abundance being limited by predators, rather than being at the carrying capacity of the ecosystem based on food resources. Due to humans having a more flexible omnivorous diet they may have been less subject to competition with other apex predators, allowing their population numbers to increase even as the number of herbivores declined.

<text>Surgeon Valentine Munbee McMaster VC (16 May 1834 – 22 January 1872) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
McMaster was born in Tiruchirappalli in India and later graduated from the University of Edinburgh Medical School with an MD.

He entered the army as an assistant surgeon in March 1855 and joined the 78th Highlanders, serving in the Persian War in 1857, before returning with the regiment to India at the beginning of the Indian Mutiny. Here, the 78th joined General Havelock’s column that advanced to relieve the siege of Lucknow. 

===VC action===
McMaster was a 23 years old assistant surgeon in the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot (later The Seaforth Highlanders) during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 25 September 1857, at the first relief of Lucknow for which he was awarded the VC:
McMaster was presented with his cross by Lieutenant General Henry Somerset in Bombay later that year. McMaster was awarded one of the eight VCs to the 78th Regiment for the Indian Mutiny. None of the awards to the 78th Regiment and no awards to Medical Officers during the Indian Mutiny were recommended under the ballot method provided in Clause 13 of the Victoria Cross Warrant. 

===Later years===
In September 1860 McMaster transferred from the 78th Highlanders to be assistant surgeon of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, moving to the 18th Hussars in June 1864. Promoted to the rank of staff-surgeon in March 1868, he returned to the 78th Highlanders in March 1869. The same year, the 78th were posted to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where McMaster married Eleanor Burmester in June 1870. They had a daughter and son, one born after McMaster&#x27;s death. In November 1871 the 78th moved to Belfast where, on 22 January 1872, McMaster died of heart disease aged 37. He was buried in Belfast City Cemetery. There is a memorial to his memory in St. Columb&#x27;s Cathedral in Derry.

McMaster&#x27;s widow Eleanor returned to Canada, where she married Canadian surgeon Campbell Mellis Douglas, who had won the VC in the 1867 Andaman Islands expedition.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National War Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh Castle.

<text>Hardy Falconer Parsons VC (13 June 1897 – 21 August 1917) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was born in Rishton, Lancashire, the son of the Reverend James Ash Parsons and Henrietta Parsons, of Leysian Mission, City Road, London. He was educated at King Edward VII School, Lytham St Annes, Kingswood School, Bath, and as a medical student at the University of Bristol, preparing for medical missionary work.

A commemorative stone was unveiled in his hometown of Rishton on 21 August 2017 at the town&#x27;s war memorial to mark 100 years since he died. As he was a Bristol University medical student, a blue plaque on his former residence was also unveiled in 2017.

He was 20 years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in the 14th (Service) Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20/21 August 1917 near Epehy, France, during a night attack by the enemy on his bombing post, the bombers holding the post were forced back, but Second Lieutenant Parsons remained at his post. Single-handed and although severely burnt by liquid fire, he continued to hold up the enemy with bombs until severely wounded. Second Lieutenant Parsons died of his wounds.

He was buried at Villers-Faucon Communal Cemetery, France.

==Citation==

<doc id="1220223" wikidata="Q5182380" url="?curid=1220223" title="Crash Vegas">
<text>Crash Vegas was a Canadian folk rock band which formed in 1988, and achieved moderate success in the early 1990s.

==Biography==
The band was formed by Michelle McAdorey and Greg Keelor of Blue Rodeo in 1988, who were also in a romantic relationship. They had met in the late 1970s, and McAdorey had later appeared in the music video for Blue Rodeo&#x27;s song &quot;Try&quot;. The two could not agree on a name for the band, originally selecting Giant Tambourine. McAdorey stated that they eventually settled on Crash Vegas by &quot;bouncing words around&quot;, a name she liked for its &quot;abrasive vividness&quot;. Jocelyne Lanois joined the band as bassist, and shortly after Ambrose Pottie joined as drummer. It was one of the early acts to emerge from the vibrant Queen Street West music scene that developed in downtown Toronto beginning in the mid 1980s.

The group&#x27;s first performance was at The Cameron House in Toronto, and it played many opening shows for Blue Rodeo over the course of the following year, including at the Horseshoe Tavern and The Rivoli, and entered an extensive writing and rehearsal period. Jocelyne introduced the band to Hamilton guitarist Colin Cripps, whose influence on the band increased as he created &quot;acoustic and ambient guitar sounds that perfectly complemented McAdorey&#x27;s yearning vocals&quot;. According to Cripps, the band&#x27;s desire for greater autonomy eventually led to firing Keelor, who was supportive of the band&#x27;s decision as his commitment to Blue Rodeo took precedence. Keelor recommended that Crash Vegas sign with Risque Disque, an imprint of Warner Music Canada, and the band recorded its first album, which was produced by Malcolm Burn in the &quot;Kingsway&quot; studio of Daniel Lanois (brother of Jocelyne) in Hamilton and New Orleans.

===&quot;Red Earth&quot;===
In July 1990, the band released its debut album &quot;Red Earth&quot;. Music critic Michael Fischer stated that the band was similar to the Cowboy Junkies &quot;without the allusive angst&quot;, and a Knight-Ridder review stated Crash Vegas to be &quot;an awake version&quot; of Cowboy Junkies. The latter also described the band&#x27;s sound as a combination of country music, pop music, and British folk rock.

The band went on extensive tours of Canada and the United States, which included opening several shows for Daniel Lanois and Blues Traveler. The band performed at Edgefest on Canada Day in 1990. It also performed at A Gathering of the Tribes in October 1990, a California music festival organized by Ian Astbury, and were described by a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; music critic as the festival&#x27;s &quot;least-known performers&quot; that merited &quot;fuller hearings in more intimate surroundings&quot;. It had several notable hits on Canadian radio (&quot;Inside Out&quot;, &quot;Sky&quot; and &quot;Smoke&quot;), and seemed poised for success.

Lanois left the band on acrimonious terms later that year, and Risque Disque went bankrupt, leaving the band in limbo. The band recorded a radio session for CBC&#x27;s &quot;Brave New Waves&quot; program as a trio in December 1990.

===&quot;Stone&quot;===
Crash Vegas signed a new deal with London/Polygram in 1992. Darren Watson replaced Lanois for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Stone&quot;, which also included contributions from John Porter and Butch Vig. Recorded in Los Angeles, the album was more energetic than &quot;Red Earth&quot;, though it also had a &quot;bleakness&quot; resulting from the dissolution of McAdorey&#x27;s romantic relationship with Keelor.

The song &quot;September Morning&quot; was a tribute to Gram Parsons, a country rock pioneer who died in September 1973 as a result of complications from recreational drug use. A review by Brooks and Wilson in &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; stated that album owed &quot;little to fad or fashion&quot;, with compelling lyrics. A review in the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; again compared Crash Vegas to Cowboy Junkies, in which reviewer Doug Iverson stated the band to be &quot;juiced up Cowboy Junkies&quot; as it would &quot;languish in quiet, elegant tunes&quot;.

Crash Vegas had a troubled relationship with Polygram, and the band subsequently moved to Sony Music Canada after contributing a cover of &quot;Pocahontas&quot; to the 1994 album &quot;Borrowed Tunes&quot;, the label&#x27;s tribute album to Neil Young. Crash Vegas was one of the bands signed to rejuvenate that label with &quot;cutting-edge, more street-oriented&quot; performers, which also included Junkhouse, Our Lady Peace, The Philosopher Kings, and Melanie Doane.

The band performed at Edgefest on Canada Day in 1993. It also participated in the Another Roadside Attraction tour organized by The Tragically Hip, which also included Midnight Oil and Hothouse Flowers as performers.

===&quot;Aurora&quot;===
In 1995, Watson and Pottie exited the band partway through the recording of their third album, &quot;Aurora&quot;. The band, now down to Cripps and McAdorey, completed the album with session musicians John Borra and Mike Sloski as their rhythm section. Gavin Brown and Eric Chenaux took over the bass and drum slots on the subsequent tour.

The compact disc release sold &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of copies in Canada, but was not released in other countries. In her book &quot;Misceallenous Female&quot;, Damhnait Doyle recounts that when she moved to Toronto from Newfoundland in the mid 1990s, she would play the song &quot;On and On (Lodestar)&quot; repeatedly with her friends, and eventually would play a cover of the song in her band Shaye. The single &quot;On and On (Lodestar)&quot; garnered significant radio airplay in Canada, becoming the second highest-charting single of the band&#x27;s career, and the music video had been added to the MuchMusic continuous play rotation by April 1995.

In 1997, the band broke up. McAdorey pursued a solo career, and Cripps went on to join Junkhouse and was later a backing musician for Kathleen Edwards and Jim Cuddy.

<doc id="1220227" wikidata="Q2441248" url="?curid=1220227" title="Anglo-Russian War (1807–1812)">
<text>The Anglo-Russian War was a war between the United Kingdom and the Russian Empire which lasted from 2 September 1807 to 18 July 1812 during the Napoleonic Wars. It began after Russia signed the Treaty of Tilsit with the First French Empire, which ended hostilities between the two nations. During the war, actual military engagements were limited primarily to minor naval actions in the Baltic Sea and Barents Sea.

==Treaty of Tilsit==

After Napoleon Bonaparte defeated the Russians at the Battle of Friedland (14 June 1807), Tsar Alexander I of Russia signed a peace treaty, known as the Treaty of Tilsit. Although the treaty was quite unpopular within the Russian court, Russia had no alternative as Napoleon could easily cross the Neman river (then the Russian border) and invade Russia.

The terms of the treaty obliged Russia to cease her maritime trade with Great Britain. This closure was a part of Napoleon&#x27;s continuing efforts to establish the Continental System, strengthening economic ties between the different countries in Europe under French domination. Napoleon&#x27;s objective was to close one of Britain&#x27;s most important markets and thus force it economically into submission.

==Military activities==

On 26 October 1807, Emperor of all the Russias Alexander formally declared war on the United Kingdom after the British attack on Copenhagen in September 1807. He did not actively prosecute the war; Alexander instead restricted Russia&#x27;s contribution to the bare requirement to close off trade. The British, understanding his position, limited their military response to the declaration. However, there were a few notable incidents.

===Detention of Russian vessels===

The official news did not arrive in Britain until 2 December, at which point the British authorities declared an embargo on all Russian vessels in British-controlled ports. The crews of approximately 70 British ships profited from the seizure of the 44-gun Russian frigate &quot;Speshnoy&quot;, which was lying at anchor in Portsmouth Harbour. The Russian storeship &quot;Wilhelmina&quot; was also seized at the same time. &quot;Speshnoy&quot; had sailed from Kronstadt with the payroll for Vice-Admiral Dmitry Senyavin’s squadron in the Mediterranean, together with &quot;Vilgemina&quot;. &quot;Vilgemina&quot; was slower but caught up with &quot;Speshnoy&quot; at Portsmouth. A portion of their cargo found on board consisted of 601,167 Spanish doubloons and 140,197 Dutch ducats. Consequently, an able seaman on any one of the 70 British vessels in the harbour received 14 shillings and 7 pence in prize money.

===Lisbon Incident===
In August 1807, Senyavin was ordered to bring his fleet from the Mediterranean to the Baltic, where the Finnish War with Sweden was already brewing. He set sail from Corfu on 19 September and although he planned to proceed directly to Saint Petersburg, stormy weather forced him to take refuge in the Tagus river and cast anchor in Lisbon on 30 October. With a French army approaching the city, Prince Regent John VI of Portugal had fled to the Portuguese colony of Brazil and the Royal Navy blockaded Lisbon, intercepting a Russian sloop as an enemy vessel because the Anglo-Russian War had been declared. In November, the French forces under the General Jean-Andoche Junot overran Lisbon.

Senyavin, placed in a delicate diplomatic position, proceeded to distinguish himself as a diplomat. He declared himself neutral and managed to protect his ships from seizure. In August 1808, British forces under the command of Arthur Wellesley defeated the French army at Vimeiro, expelling them from Portugal. Senyavin&#x27;s squadron of seven ships of the line and one frigate were left face to face with fifteen British ships of the line and ten frigates. Senyavin maintained his neutrality, threatening to blow up his ships and destroy Lisbon in the case of an attack made against his squadron. Eventually, he signed a convention with Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, whereby the Royal Navy would escort his squadron to London, with the Russians still flying their flags. Moreover, Senyavin was to assume supreme command of the joint Anglo-Russian fleet, as he was higher in rank than Cotton. Two ships of Senyavin&#x27;s squadron, &quot;Rafail&quot; and &quot;Yaroslav&quot;, were left in Lisbon due to needing repairs.

Senyavin&#x27;s squadron embarked from Portugal for Portsmouth on 31 August 1808. On 27 September, it arrived at Portsmouth Harbour, and the British Admiralty was informed that the Russians had arrived with their flags streaming, as if in times of peace. The Lord Mayor of London, Charles Flower, argued that the convention was &quot;disreputable for Britain&#x27;s prestige&quot;, which many in the Admiralty agreed with. Senyavin&#x27;s squadron was therefore detained in Portsmouth under various pretexts until winter, when the weather made their return to the Baltic impossible. The authorities in Portsmouth insisted that unless Senyavin&#x27;s squadron sailed to Arkhangelsk, they would be intercepted by the Swedish Navy. In 1809, the departure of the squadron was further delayed by the disastrous Walcheren Expedition. At long last, on 5 August, Senyavin&#x27;s squadron was allowed to leave Portsmouth for Riga, arriving there on 9 September 1809.

===Naval conflict in the Baltic===

Russia also invaded Sweden, a close ally of Britain, in 1808. But it was unlikely related to Britain and the Treaty, as the two countries already were at odds at the time. The Royal Navy supported the Swedish navy during the Finnish War and scored victories over the Russians in the Gulf of Finland in July 1808 and August 1809. In May 1808, the British sent a fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir James Saumarez to the Baltic. The British 44-gun frigate captured the Russian cutter &quot;Opyt&quot; on 1808, after her captain and crew put up a determined resistance. The action took place off Nargen island (now Naissaar), which defends Reval from the sea. The Admiralty took &quot;Opyt&quot; into service as HMS &quot;Baltic&quot;.

====&quot;Centaur&quot; and &quot;Implacable&quot; vs. &quot;Vsevolod&quot;====

On 9 July, the Russian fleet, under Admiral Pyotr Khanykov, came out from Kronstadt. The Swedes massed a fleet under Admiral Rudolf Cederström, consisting of 11 line-of-battle ships and 5 frigates at Örö and Jungfrusund to oppose them. On 16 August, Saumarez then sent 74-guns and to join the Swedish fleet. They chased two Russian frigates on the 19th and joined the Swedes the following day.

On 22 August, the Russian fleet, consisting of nine ships of the line, five large frigates and six smaller ones, moved from Hanko to threaten the Swedes. The Swedes, with the two British ships, grouped at Örö, and three days later sailed to meet the Russians.

The Russians and the Anglo-Swedish force were fairly evenly matched, but the Russians retreated and the Allied ships followed them. &quot;Centaur&quot; and &quot;Implacable&quot; were better vessels than the Swedish ships and slowly pulled ahead, with &quot;Implacable&quot; catching up with a Russian straggler, the 74-gun &quot;Vsevolod&quot;, under Captain Daniil Rudnev (or Roodneff). Eventually, and after heavy casualties, &quot;Vsevolod&quot; struck her colours. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasps &quot;Implacable 26 Augt. 1808&quot; and &quot;Centaur 26 Augt. 1808&quot; to the surviving claimants (41 per vessel) from the action.

Vice-Admiral Saumerez with his entire squadron joined the Anglo-Swedish squadron the next day. They then blockaded Khanykov&#x27;s squadron for some months. After the British and the Swedes abandoned the blockade, the Russian fleet was able to return to Kronstadt.

====Boat actions====

On 7 and 8 July 1809, the boats of , , and captured or destroyed several Russian gunboats and a convoy off Hanko Peninsula in the Baltic. Among the captured vessels were Russian gun boats No.5, No.10, No. 13, and No.15. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;7 July Boat Service 1809&quot; to 33 surviving claimants from the action.

On 10 July, 18 Russian boats attacked the English ship at Pitcamp and it was forced to retreat hastily.
19 British boats attacked several russian boats 3 days later, and the Russians lost 3 boats in this battle.

Then on 25 July seventeen boats from a British squadron consisting of , , and , attacked a flotilla of four Russian gunboats and a brig off Aspö Head near Fredrikshamn in Old Finland, then part of Russian Empire. Captain Forrest of &quot;Prometheus&quot; commanded the boats and succeeded in capturing gunboats Nos. 62, 65, and 66, and the transport brig No. 11. The action was sanguinary in that the British lost 19 men killed and 51 wounded, and the Russians lost 28 men killed and 59 wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp &quot;25 July Boat Service 1809&quot; to 35 surviving claimants from the action.

However the successes of the Russian army on land forced Sweden to sign a peace treaty with Russia in 1809 whereby, &quot;inter alia&quot;, Sweden ceded the later Grand Duchy of Finland to Russia. Sweden sued for peace with France in 1810 and then formally joined the blockade against Britain as required by the Continental System, although in practice did little to enforce it. Sweden kept trading with Britain and the Royal Navy kept using Swedish ports.

===Naval raids in the Barents Sea===

In time, the Anglo-Russian War overlapped with the Gunboat War against Denmark-Norway, leading the British to expand their trade embargo to Russian waters and to forays by the British navy northwards into the Barents Sea. The navy conducted raids on Hasvik and Hammerfest and disrupted the Pomor trade, the Norwegian trade with Russia.

In June 1809 HMS &quot;Nyaden&quot; participated in one or two actions. First, her boats conducted a night raid on Kildin Island that neutralised a Russian garrison there. Boats from &quot;Nyaden&quot; also captured some 22–23 coastal trading vessels in the Kola River, many upriver from the present city of Murmansk. &quot;Nyaden&quot; also took several other Russian vessels at sea as prizes.

&quot;Nyaden&quot; was probably the vessel whose boats in July took possession of Catherine Harbour, in the &quot;ostrog&quot;, or fortified settlement, of Kola. The British also commandeered all the stores belonging to the White Sea Company (est. 1803 at Archangelsk). &quot;The Times&quot; reported that this was the first British engagement in Russian territory, news of the actions on Kildin Island either being subsumed or overlooked.

British naval involvement in the region continued into 1811. On 3 August 1810, the brig captured the &quot;St. Peder&quot;. Next year, on 2 January, &quot;Gallant&quot; captured the Danish privateer &quot;Restorateur&quot; off the Norwegian coast. &quot;Restorateur&quot; was armed with six 12-pounder guns and had a crew of 19 men. Four months later, on 5 April, &quot;Gallant&quot; captured the &quot;Victoria&quot;. Then on 1 August 1811, the frigate , which was operating out of the Lieth station, captured the Russian vessels &quot;Michael&quot;, &quot;Ivan Isasima&quot;, and &quot;St. Oluff&quot;, and their cargoes.

=== Persia ===

During the Russo-Persian War, several British officers, who were part of Sir John Malcolm&#x27;s 1809 embassy to Persia, remained in Persia and provided training to the reforming Persian army. One of the officers, William Monteith, accompanied Abbas Mirza on his unsuccessful campaign in Georgia and then commanded a frontier force and the garrison of Erivan.

==Outcome==
Alexander I kept Russia as neutral as possible in the ongoing French war with Britain. He allowed Russians to continue secretly to trade with Britain and did not enforce the blockade required by Continental System. In 1810, he withdrew Russia from the Continental System and trade between Britain and Russia grew.

Franco-Russian relations became progressively worse after 1810. By 1811, it became clear that Napoleon was not keeping to his side of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit. He had promised assistance to Russia in its war against the Ottoman Empire, but as the campaign went on, France offered no support at all.

With war imminent between France and Russia, Alexander started to prepare the ground diplomatically. In April 1812 Russia and Sweden signed an agreement for mutual defence. A month later Alexander secured his southern flank by the Treaty of Bucharest (1812), which formally ended the war against Turkey.

After Napoleon invaded Russia in June, the British and the Russians signed one Treaty of Örebro on 18 July 1812; on that same day and in the same place the British and Swedes signed another Treaty of Örebro ending the Anglo-Swedish War (1810–1812), a war that had had no engagements and no casualties.

<doc id="1220230" wikidata="Q5723866" url="?curid=1220230" title="Henry James Nicholas">
<text>Henry James Nicholas, (11 June 1891 – 23 October 1918) was a New Zealand recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Lincoln, Nicholas was a carpenter when he volunteered for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) during the First World War. He was posted to the 1st Battalion of the Canterbury Regiment and served on the Western Front. He received the Victoria Cross for his actions during an attack on the Polderhoek Spur on 3 December 1917. He was later awarded the Military Medal for his actions in an engagement during the Hundred Days Offensive. He was killed in action three weeks before the end of the war.

==Early life==
Nicholas was born in Lincoln, near Christchurch, in New Zealand on 11 June 1891 to Richard and Hannah Nicholas and was one of four boys. He did his schooling in Christchurch, first at Christchurch Normal School and later at Christchurch East School. After completing his education, he took up an apprenticeship to a builder, learning carpentry. He later worked in Australia for four years. On returning to New Zealand in 1915, he joined New Zealand&#x27;s part-time militia, the Territorial Force, and served in the Field Engineers.

==First World War==
In February 1916, Nicholas enlisted in the New Zealand Military Forces, giving his occupation as a carpenter. Volunteering for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), he embarked for Europe three months later with the 13th Reinforcements. After an initial period at the NZEF training facilities at Sling Camp in England, where he was the regimental boxing champion in the middle-weight class, he was sent to the Western Front and posted to the 1st Battalion of the Canterbury Regiment with the rank of private. 

Nicholas&#x27; battalion was part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, New Zealand Division, and in mid-1917 took part in the Battle of Messines. A few months later, the battalion was operating in the Ypres Salient and actively engaged in the Battle of Passchendaele. Towards the end of the year, his battalion was involved in an attack on Polderhoek Chateau on 3 December. The chateau, atop the Polderhoek Spur in the Ypres Salient and held by the Germans, overlooked the trenches occupied by the brigade. Its Canterbury and Otago battalions attacked midday but both were slowed by heavy machine-gun fire. It was then that Nicholas performed the actions that led to the award of the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. His VC citation read as follows:
The advance resumed but ground to a halt short of the chateau where the New Zealanders established a new front line. During this phase of attack, Nicholas moved along the lines, collecting and distributing ammunition. What was left of the Canterbury and Otago battalions was relieved on 5 December. The award of the VC to Nicholas was gazetted in January 1918. Shortly afterwards, the New Zealand Division was withdrawn from the Ypres sector for a rest, but it was recalled when the Germans launched their Spring Offensive. Nicholas&#x27; battalion was dispatched to the Somme on 23 March. Along with the rest of the division it helped stabilise the front until it was placed in reserve in June.

In July Nicholas was sent to England where he was presented with his VC by King George V at an investiture at Buckingham Palace, having been promoted to sergeant the previous month. During the Hundred Days Offensive that commenced later in the year, he was awarded the Military Medal (MM) for actions performed in late September to early October during operations on Welsh and Bon Avis Ridges. On 23 October, he was performing guard duty at a bridge near Le Quesnoy when a German patrol encountered his position. He was killed during the ensuing exchange of gunfire. He was buried in the Vertigneul Churchyard on 29 October and the award of his MM was gazetted in March 1919. The citation made note of his &quot;fearless leadership and contempt for danger&quot;.

==The Medal==
Nicholas&#x27; VC was presented to his mother by Colonel A. Chaffey, the commander of the Canterbury Military District, in a private ceremony held at her home on Anzac Day, 25 April 1919. She bequeathed the VC, his MM, and his service medals to the Canterbury Museum in 1932, where they remain on display.

==Legacy==
There are a number of memorials dedicated to Nicholas in New Zealand; he is remembered in the Nicholas family plot in the Bromley Cemetery in Christchurch. Also in the city, a bronze statue with biographical details of Nicholas was erected on the banks of the Avon River on 7 March 2007, near the Bridge of Remembrance. There is also a plaque honouring him in Queen&#x27;s Garden in Dunedin. In September 2008, a plaque in memory of Nicholas was unveiled by the community of Zonnebeke and the New Zealand Embassy in Brussels, near Geluveld, just southwest of the area where he won the VC.

<text>Kenneth Grant (23 May 1924 – 15 January 2011) was an English ceremonial magician, novelist, and advocate of the Thelemic religion. A poet, novelist, and writer, he founded his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis—later renamed the Typhonian Order—with his wife Steffi Grant.

Born in Ilford, Essex, Grant developed an interest in occultism and Eastern religions during his teenage years. After service with the British Army during the Second World War, he returned to Britain and became the personal secretary of Aleister Crowley, the ceremonial magician who had founded Thelema in 1904. Crowley instructed Grant in his esoteric practices and initiated him into his own occult order, Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). When Crowley died in 1947, Grant was seen as his heir apparent in Great Britain, and was appointed as such by the American head of O.T.O., Karl Germer. In 1949, Grant befriended the occult artist Austin Osman Spare, and in ensuing years helped to publicise Spare&#x27;s artwork through a series of publications.

In 1954 Grant founded the London-based New Isis Lodge, through which he added to many of Crowley&#x27;s Thelemic teachings, bringing in extraterrestrial themes and influences from the work of fantasy writer H. P. Lovecraft. This was anathema to Germer, who expelled Grant from O.T.O. in 1955, although the latter continued to operate his Lodge regardless until 1962. During the 1950s he also came to be increasingly interested in Hinduism, exploring the teachings of the Indian guru Ramana Maharshi and publishing a range of articles on the topic. He was particularly interested in the Hindu tantra, incorporating ideas from it into the Thelemic practices of sex magic. On Germer&#x27;s death in 1969, Grant proclaimed himself Outer Head of O.T.O. This title was disputed by the American Grady McMurtry, who took control of O.T.O. Grant&#x27;s Order became known as the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis, operating from his home in Golders Green, north London. In 1959 he began publishing on occultism and wrote the Typhonian Trilogies as well as various novels and books of poetry, much of which propagated the work of Crowley and Spare.

Grant&#x27;s writings and teachings have proved a significant influence over other currents of occultism, including chaos magic, the Temple of Set, and the Dragon Rouge. They also attracted academic interest within the study of Western esotericism, particularly from Henrik Bogdan and Dave Evans.

==Biography==

===Early life and Aleister Crowley: 1924–1947===
Grant was born on 23 May 1924 in Ilford, Essex, the son of a Welsh clergyman. By his early teenage years, Grant had read widely on the subject of Western esotericism and Asian religions, including the work of prominent occultist Helena Blavatsky. He had made use of a personal magical symbol ever since being inspired to do so in a visionary dream he experienced in 1939; he spelled its name variously as A&#x27;ashik, Oshik, or Aossic. Aged 18, in the midst of the Second World War, Grant volunteered to join the British Army, later commenting that he hoped to be posted to British India, where he could find a spiritual guru to study under. He was never posted abroad, and was ejected from the army aged 20 due to an unspecified medical condition.
Grant was fascinated by the work of the occultist Aleister Crowley, having read a number of his books. Eager to meet Crowley, Grant unsuccessfully wrote to Crowley&#x27;s publishers, asking them to give him his address; however, the publisher had moved address themselves, meaning that they never received his letter. He also requested that Michael Houghton, proprietor of Central London&#x27;s esoteric bookstore Atlantis Bookshop, introduce him to Crowley. Houghton refused, privately remarking that Grant was &quot;mentally unstable.&quot; Grant later stated his opinion that Houghton had refused because he did not wish to &quot;incur evil &quot;karma&quot;&quot; from introducing the young man to Crowley, but later suggested that it was because Houghton desired him for his own organisation, The Order of Hidden Masters, and thereby did not want him to become Crowley&#x27;s disciple. Persisting, Grant wrote letters to the new address of Crowley&#x27;s publishers, asking that they pass his letters on to Crowley himself. These resulted in the first meeting between the two, in autumn 1944, at the Bell Inn in Buckinghamshire.

After several further meetings and an exchange of letters, Grant agreed to work for Crowley as his secretary and personal assistant. Now living in relative poverty, Crowley was unable to pay Grant for his services in money, instead paying him in magical instruction. In March 1945, Grant moved into a lodge cottage in the grounds of Netherwood, a Sussex boarding house where Crowley was living. He continued living there with Crowley for several months, dealing with the old man&#x27;s correspondences and needs. In turn, he was allowed to read from Crowley&#x27;s extensive library on occult subjects, and performed ceremonial magic workings with him, becoming a high initiate of Crowley&#x27;s magical group, Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). Crowley saw Grant as a potential leader of O.T.O. in the UK, writing in his diary, &quot;value of Grant. If I die or go to the USA, there must be a trained man to take care of the English O.T.O.&quot; However, they also argued, with Grant trying to convince Crowley to relocate to London. On one occasion Crowley shouted at him: &quot;You are the most consummate BORE that the world has yet known. And this at 20!&quot;

Grant&#x27;s family disliked that he was working for no wage, and pressured him to resign, which he did in June 1945, leaving Netherwood. Crowley wrote to Grant&#x27;s father, stating that he was &quot;very sorry to part with Kenneth&quot; and that he felt that Grant was &quot;giving up his real future.&quot; To David Curwen, an O.T.O. member who was another of his correspondents, Crowley related his opinion that &quot;I may have treated him too severely.&quot; Crowley put Curwen in contact with Grant, with Grant later claiming that he learned much from Curwen, particularly regarding the Kaula school of Tantra; in his later writings, he made reference to Curwen using his Order name of Frater Ani Abthilal. Although they continued to correspond with one another, Crowley and Grant never met again, for the former died in December 1947. Grant attended Crowley&#x27;s funeral at a Brighton crematorium, while accompanied by his new wife, Steffi.

===The New Isis Lodge and Austin Osman Spare: 1947–1969===

Steffi Grant introduced herself to the occult artist Austin Osman Spare in 1949, having learned about him while she was modelling for Herbert Budd, a tutor at St. Martin&#x27;s School of Art who had studied alongside Spare. Steffi purchased two of Spare&#x27;s artworks, which she gave to Kenneth as a present for his twenty-fifth birthday. She subsequently introduced her husband to Spare.
At the time, Spare had fallen into poverty, living in obscurity in a South London flat. Although making some money as an artist and art tutor, he was largely financially supported by his friend Frank Letchford, whom he affectionately referred to as his &quot;son&quot;. There was some animosity between Letchford and Grant, although it is apparent that Spare preferred the former, having known him for 12 years longer, and placing him first in his will. Grant desired a closer relationship, and in 1954 began signing his letters to Spare &quot;thy son.&quot; Letchford claimed that Spare often told the Grants &quot;white lies ... to boost a flagging ego.&quot; Grant&#x27;s first published work represented a brief &quot;appreciation&quot; of Spare&#x27;s work that was included in a catalogue for the artist&#x27;s exhibition held at Temple Bar in London in 1949.

Grant had continued studying Crowley&#x27;s work, and a year after Crowley&#x27;s death was acknowledged as a Ninth Degree member of O.T.O. by Karl Germer, Crowley&#x27;s successor as Head of O.T.O. Grant then successfully applied to Germer for a charter to operate the first three O.T.O. degrees and run his own lodge, which was granted in March 1951. As this would mean that his lodge would be the only chartered O.T.O. body in England at the time, Grant believed that it meant that he was now head of O.T.O. in Britain. Germer put Grant in contact with Wilfred Talbot Smith, an English Thelemite based in California who had founded the Agape Lodge, knowing that Smith was the only man who had practical knowledge of O.T.O. degree work. Smith was eager to help, and wrote at length on his experiences in founding a lodge, although he was made uneasy by Grant&#x27;s magical seal of &quot;Aossic&quot; for reasons that have never been ascertained, and their correspondence soon petered out.

Grant began restructuring the system of O.T.O. by augmenting its grading structure with that of Crowley&#x27;s other occult order, the A∴A∴. This attempt failed, as Grant&#x27;s attentions were increasingly drawn into his founding and running of the New Isis Lodge. The lodge became operational in April 1955 when Grant issued a manifesto announcing his discovery of an extraterrestrial &quot;Sirius/Set current&quot; upon which the lodge was to be based. In this manifesto, Grant claimed that a new energy was emanating down from Earth from another planet which he identified with Nuit, a goddess who appears in the first chapter of Crowley&#x27;s Thelemic holy text, &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Germer however deemed it &quot;blasphemy&quot; that Grant had identified a single planet with Nuit; on 20 July 1955, Germer issued a &quot;Note of Expulsion&quot; expelling Grant from O.T.O.

Grant however ignored Germer&#x27;s letter of expulsion, continuing to operate the New Isis Lodge under the claim that he had powers from the &quot;Inner Plane&quot;. Upon learning of Grant&#x27;s expulsion, Smith feared that O.T.O. would split up into warring factions much as the Theosophical Society had done following the death of Blavatsky. Grant&#x27;s Lodge continued to operate until 1962. According to Grant, the group consisted of about thirty members and met every seventh Friday at the lodge&#x27;s premises, which for a while were in the basement of Curwen&#x27;s furrier&#x27;s store at Melcombe Street, near to Baker Street in central London. During the period in which he worked with the lodge he claimed to have received two important texts from preternatural sources, the &quot;Wisdom of S&#x27;lba&quot; and &quot;OKBISh&quot; or &quot;The Book of the Spider&quot;.

From 1953 to 1961 Grant immersed himself in the study of Hinduism, becoming a follower of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi. He was also interested in the work of another Hindu teacher, Lord Kusuma Haranath, and was credited with encouraging and helping to create the three-volume &quot;Lord Haranath: A Biography&quot; by Akella Ramakrishna Sastri. He also authored articles on Advaita Vedanta and other Hindu topics for Indian journals like the Bombay-based &quot;The Call Divine&quot;, as well as for Richard Cavendish&#x27;s &quot;Man, Myth &amp; Magic&quot;. Many of these articles would be collected into a single anthology and published as &quot;At the Feet of the Guru&quot; in 2005. Grant believed that the O.T.O.&#x27;s sex magic teachings needed to be refashioned along tantric principles from Indian religion, in doing so relying heavily on Curwen&#x27;s ideas about tantra.

After Spare&#x27;s death, Grant began to focus more on his own writing career. From 1959 to 1963, Grant privately published the &quot;Carfax Monographs&quot;, a series of short articles on magic published in ten instalments, each at a limited print run of 100. Nine of these volumes included original artworks produced by Steffi, reflecting the increasing collaboration between husband and wife which would be reflected in many of Grant&#x27;s subsequent publications. The &quot;Carfax Monographs&quot; would eventually be assembled together and re-released as &quot;Hidden Lore&quot; in 1989. In 1966 he also privately published a small book of his poems, &quot;Black to Black and Other Poems&quot;. During the 1950s and 1960s Grant also authored a number of novellas, although these would only be published by Starfire Publishing between 1997 and 2012.

===Typhonian O.T.O. and growing fame: 1970–2011===

In 1969, Grant co-edited &quot;The Confessions of Aleister Crowley&quot; for publication with Crowley&#x27;s literary executor John Symonds. Over the coming years he edited – often with Symonds – a range of Crowley writings for republication, resulting in the release of &quot;The Magical Record of the Beast 666&quot; (1972), &quot;Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot; (1972), &quot;Moonchild&quot; (1972), &quot;Magick&quot; (1973), &quot;Magical and Philosophical Commentaries on The Book of the Law&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Complete Astrological Writings&quot; (1974). The release of these publications has been described as being &quot;instrumental in the revival of interest in Crowley&quot;.

At this point, Grant began describing himself as O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.

In 1972, Frederick Muller Limited published the first book in Grant&#x27;s &quot;Typhonian Trilogies&quot; series, &quot;The Magical Revival&quot;, in which he discussed various events within the history of Western esotericism while also encouraging future interest in the subject. He followed this with a sequel published in 1973, &quot;Aleister Crowley and the Hidden God&quot;, in which he examined Crowley&#x27;s sex magical practices and the Tantra. This was followed in 1975 by &quot;Cults of the Shadow&quot;, which brought the first Typhonian Trilogy to an end with a discussion of the left-hand path in magic, making reference to both Crowley and Spare&#x27;s work, as well as to Voodoo and Tantra. That same year, Grant also published &quot;Images and Oracles of Austin Osman Spare&quot;, a collection of his late friend&#x27;s images based on 20 years of research. The volume did not sell well, with much of the stock being remaindered, although became a rare collector&#x27;s item in later years. Grant had begun work on the book many years before and had agreed for 500 copies to be published by Trigram Press Ltd in 1967, although at the last minute the project was cancelled. He had also authored new introductions for re-releases of two of Spare&#x27;s works, a 1973 publication of &quot;The Anathema of Zos&quot; and a 1975 release of &quot;The Book of Pleasure&quot;.

In 1977, Grant began the second Typhonian Trilogy with &quot;Nightside of Eden&quot;, in which he discussed some of his own personal magical ideas, outlining magical formulae with which to explore a dark, dense realm that he variously called &#x27;Universe B&#x27; and &#x27;the Tunnels of Set&#x27;, conceived as a &#x27;dark side&#x27; of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Grant made connections between this realm and the extramundane deities of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s horror fiction. The book proved controversial among occultists and Thelemites, and starkly divided opinion. The sequel appeared in 1980 as &quot;Outside the Circles of Time&quot;, and introduced Grant&#x27;s thoughts on the relevance of Ufology and insectoid symbolism for occultism. This would prove to be the final Grant volume published by Muller, who would merge with Blond and Briggs in 1984, while the publishing rights to his works reverted to him the following year. His next book would not appear for another eleven years after &quot;Outside the Circles of Time&quot;.

In 1989, Grant began his relationship with Skoob Books Limited, a publisher linked to the Skoob Books bookstore in Bloomsbury, central London which had begun to develop a line of esoteric titles under the leadership of Caroline Wise and Chris Johnson. In 1991, Skoob Books published Grant&#x27;s &quot;Remembering Aleister Crowley&quot;, a volume containing his memoirs of Crowley alongside reproductions of diary entries, photographs, and letters. From 1989 to 1994, Skoob reissued a number of Grant&#x27;s earlier books, and in 1992 published the sixth volume in the Typhonian Trilogies, &quot;Hecate&#x27;s Fountain&quot;, in which Grant provided many anecdotes about working in the New Isis Lodge and focused on describing accidents and fatalities that he believed were caused by magic. The seventh volume of the Typhonian Trilogies, &quot;Outer Gateways&quot;, followed in 1994, discussing Grant&#x27;s ideas of older Typhonian traditions from across the world, with reference to the work of Crowley, Spare, and Lovecraft. It ends with the text of &quot;The Wisdom of S&#x27;lba&quot;, a work that Grant claimed he had received clairvoyantly from a supernatural source.

After Skoob Books closed its esoteric publishing division, in 1996 Grant transferred the publishing rights of his books to two companies, Starfire Publishing – which decided to bring out his trilogies and novellas – and Fulgur Limited, which published his work on Spare.
In 1997 Starfire published Grant&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Against the Light: A Nightside Narrative&quot;, which involved a character also named &quot;Kenneth Grant&quot;. He asserted that the work was &quot;quasi-autobiographical&quot;, but never specified which parts were based on his life and which were fictional. In 1998, Starfire published a book co-written by Grant and his wife Steffi, titled &quot;Zos Speaks! Encounters with Austin Osman Spare&quot;, in which they included 7 years&#x27; worth of diary entries, letters, and photographs pertaining to their relationship with the artist. The following year, the next volume in the Typhonian Trilogies, &quot;Beyond the Mauve Zone&quot; was published, explaining Grant&#x27;s ideas on a realm known as the Mauve Zone that he claimed to have explored. A book containing two novellas, &quot;Snakewand and the Darker Strain&quot;, was published in 2000, while the final volume of the Typhonian Trilogies, &quot;The Ninth Arch&quot;, was published in 2003. It offered further Qabalistic interpretations of the work of Crowley, Spare, and Lovecraft, and the text of another work that Grant claimed had been given to him from a supernatural source, &quot;Book of the Spider&quot;. That same year, Grant also published two further volumes of fictional stories, &quot;Gamaliel and Dance, Doll, Dance!&quot;, which told the story of a vampire and a Tantric sex group, and &quot;The Other Child, and Other Tales&quot;, which contained six short stories.

Grant died on 15 January 2011 after a period of illness. He was survived by his wife.

==Beliefs and teachings==

Grant drew eclectically on a range of sources in devising his teachings. Although based in Thelema, Grant&#x27;s Typhonian tradition has been described as &quot;a &quot;bricolage&quot; of occultism, Neo-Vedanta, Hindu tantra, Western sexual magic, Surrealism, ufology and Lovecraftian gnosis&quot;. According to Djurdjevic, Grant&#x27;s writing style is notorious for being opaque with &quot;verbal and conceptual labyrinths&quot;. The historian of religion Manon Hedenborg White noted that &quot;Grant&#x27;s writings do not lend themselves easily to systematization&quot;. She added that he &quot;deliberately employs cryptic or circuitous modes of argumentation&quot;, and lacks clear boundaries between fact and fiction.

Grant promoted what he termed the Typhonian or Draconian tradition of magic, and wrote that Thelema was only a recent manifestation of this wider tradition. In his books, he portrayed the Typhonian tradition as the world&#x27;s oldest spiritual tradition, suggesting that it had ancient roots in Africa. In Central Africa during prehistory, he believed there had been a primordial serpent cult devoted to the worship of a goddess known as Ta-Urt or Typhon, from which the Typhonian tradition stems. This was an idea he had adopted from Gerald Massey&#x27;s 1881 publication &quot;A Book of Beginnings&quot;, a work promoting ideas which had never been accepted among scholars of religion. According to Grant, Typhonianism was typified by its worship of female deities and its use of sex as a method of spiritual achievement. He wrote that this tradition spread throughout the world, forming the basis of the ancient Egyptian religion, as well as the Hindu and Buddhist tantra and forms of Western esotericism. He added that for millennia, the Typhonian tradition has been opposed by the &quot;Osirians&quot; or &quot;Solarites&quot;, practitioners of a patriarchal and solar religions, who have portrayed the Typhonians as evil, corrupt, and debauched. The religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic noted that Grant&#x27;s Typhonian history was &quot;at best highly speculative&quot; and lacked any supporting evidence, however he suggested that Grant may never have intended it to be taken literally.

Grant adopted a perennialist interpretation of the history of religion. Grant&#x27;s claims that Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga correlate to Western esoteric traditions, and that both stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of Western esotericists. However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant&#x27;s appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has much in common with Theosophy, although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the left-hand path.

Influenced by Maharshi, Grant adopted the Advaitan worldview that only &quot;the Self&quot;, or &quot;atman&quot;, really exists, with the wider universe being an illusory projection. He believed that by mastering magic, one masters this illusory universe, gaining personal liberation and recognising that only the Self really exists. Doing so, according to Grant, leads to the discovery of one&#x27;s True Will, the central focus of Thelema. Grant further claimed that the realm of the Self was known as &quot;the Mauve Zone&quot;, and that it could be reached while in a state of deep sleep, where it has the symbolic appearance of a swamp. He also believed that the reality of consciousness, which he deemed the only true reality, was formless and thus presented as a void, although he also taught that it was symbolised by the Hindu goddess Kali and the Thelemic goddess Nuit.

Grant&#x27;s views on sex magic drew heavily on the importance of sexual dimorphism among humans and the subsequent differentiation of gender roles. Grant taught that the true secret of sex magic were bodily secretions, the most important of which was a woman&#x27;s menstrual blood. In this he differed from Crowley, who viewed semen as the most important genital secretion. Grant referred to female sexual secretions as &quot;kalas&quot;, a term adopted from Sanskrit. He thought that because women possess &quot;kalas&quot;, they have oracular and visionary powers. The magical uses of female genital secretions are a recurring theme in Grant&#x27;s writings.
He believed that the XI° degree O.T.O. ritual, which Crowley argued necessitated anal sex, should instead involve vaginal sex with a menstruating woman. He was critical of Crowley&#x27;s use of anal sex in rituals, stating his view that the &quot;sodomitical formula&quot; was &quot;a perversion of magical practice&quot;. These views have brought accusations of homophobia from later occultists such as Phil Hine.

==Personal life==

Grant was a reclusive figure. Unlike various contemporaries in the occult scene, he did not lecture publicly. Janine Chapman, an esotericist who met Grant during the 1970s, described him as &quot;an attractive, well-mannered, well-dressed man in his forties, intelligent, cultivated, and friendly.&quot;

==Legacy==
The historian of religion Dave Evans noted that Grant was &quot;certainly unique&quot; in the history of British esotericism because of his &quot;close dealings&quot; with Crowley, Spare, and Gardner, the &quot;three most influential Western occultists of the 20th century.&quot; The occultist and comic book author Alan Moore thought it &quot;hard to name&quot; any other living individual who &quot;has done more to shape contemporary western thinking with regard to Magic&quot; than Grant, and characterized the Typhonian O.T.O. as &quot;a schoolboy gone berserk on brimstone aftershave.&quot;

In 2003, the historian of Western esotericism Henrik Bogdan expressed the view that Grant was &quot;perhaps (the) most original and prolific English author of the post-modern occultist genre.&quot; Djurdjevic stated that Grant&#x27;s engagement with Indian spiritual traditions was &quot;both substantial and innovative&quot; as well as controversial, while adding that Grant&#x27;s emphasis on the importance of female sexual fluids helped contribute to the &quot;transformation of the hegemonic masculinity&quot; in Western occultism.
Although membership of Grant&#x27;s own occult groups remained small, his Typhonian Thelemic system represented a significant influence over various other occult groups and currents. They included chaos magic, as well as the Temple of Set, the Dragon Rouge, and Andrew D. Chumbley&#x27;s Cultus Sabbati. The anthropologist Justin Woodman noted that Grant was &quot;one of the key figures&quot; for bringing H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s literary works into magical theory and practice, adding that his writings were a &quot;formative influence&quot; on Lovecraftian occult groups like the Esoteric Order of Dagon, founded in North America during the late 1980s.

The occultist Peter Levenda discussed Grant&#x27;s work in his 2013 essay, &quot;The Dark Lord: H. P. Lovecraft, Kenneth Grant, and the Typhonian Tradition in Magic&quot;. Here, he asserted that Grant&#x27;s importance was in attempting to create &quot;a more global character for Thelema&quot; by introducing ideas and concepts borrowed from the Hindu tantra, Yazidism, and Afro-Caribbean syncretic religions.

==Bibliography==

Grant published his work over a period of five decades, providing both a synthesis of Crowley and Spare&#x27;s work and new, often idiosyncratic interpretations of them. Evans described Grant as having &quot;an often confusing, oblique, and sanity-challenging writing style&quot; that blends fictional stories with accounts of real-life people.

In 2003, Bogdan&#x27;s first edition of a Grant bibliography was published by Academia Esoterica Press. This was followed by a second, updated edition in 2015, which contained a full biography of Grant&#x27;s work:

==Former exhibits==

*Dolphinarium: The zoo kept bottlenose dolphins from 1986 until 2001. To prevent further dolphin deaths, the dolphins were returned to Mississippi, and the exhibit now hosts sea lions.
*Monkey Island: Located at the entrance, monkeys would play, eat, and even sleep on a specially made island that was dug down into the ground. Opened in 1935 and dismantled in 1998. The decision was made to get rid of it because zoo visitors would either drop or throw hazardous materials on to the island, and the monkeys would choke. The island was closed and filled in. Today, there is a plaza at the entrance, with a gift shop, a restaurant, and the ZooFriends&#x27; office surround a floor where monkey island once was. From 1935 to 1985, there was a ship on the island.
*Primate House: Built in the 1950s. The apes were kept there until 1993. In 1993, the apes were given a more natural habitat. The building was torn down and the Canopy Food Court was built in its place.

==Famous animals==

Judy was a famous elephant of the zoo having been a part of the zoo for almost 50 years.

Malee was an Asian elephant born April 15, 2011, weighing 300 pounds, the child of one of the Oklahoma City Zoo&#x27;s elephants, Asha, and a male elephant named Sneezy who lives at the Tulsa Zoo. The Zoo held birthday parties for her every year. On September 30, 2015, zookeepers noticed discoloration of her trunk. After two failed treatments, she died at 4 AM CST on October 1, 2015. The cause of death was determined to be elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus, which the other elephants at the zoo aside from her sister Achara also had.

Tusko was a male Indian elephant who was subject to a controversial drug experiment at the zoo, when it was then known as the Lincoln Park Zoo. On August 3, 1962, researchers from the University of Oklahoma injected him with 297 mg of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), which is nearly three thousand times the human recreational dose (for an animal weighing roughly one hundred times as much as a human). Within five minutes he collapsed to the ground and one hour and forty minutes later he died. It is believed that the LSD was the cause of his death, although some speculate that the drugs the researchers used in an attempt to revive him may have contributed to his death. The elephant later became the inspiration for the song &quot;Tusko&quot; on the album &quot;Elephants on Acid&quot; by hip hop group Cypress Hill.

<doc id="1220240" wikidata="Q145606" url="?curid=1220240" title="Albert VI, Archduke of Austria">
<text>Albert VI (; 18 December 1418 – 2 December 1463), a member of the House of Habsburg, was Duke of Austria from 1424, elevated to Archduke in 1453. As a scion of the Leopoldian line, he ruled over the Inner Austrian duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola from 1424, from 1457 also over the Archduchy of Austria until his death, rivalling with his elder brother Emperor Frederick III. According to tradition, Albert, later known as &quot;the Prodigal&quot;, was the exact opposite of Frederick: energetic and inclined to thoughtlessness.

==Biography==
Albert was born in Vienna, the son of the Inner Austrian duke Ernest the Iron from his second marriage with the Piast princess Cymburgis of Masovia. Still minors upon the death of their father in 1424, he and his brother remained under the tutelage of their uncle Duke Frederick IV of the Empty Pockets, who ruled over Further Austria and the County of Tyrol.

Coming of age in 1436, Albert, though a junior heir of Inner Austria, received no full rulership anywhere for a long time, which caused friction in his relations with his elder brother Frederick V. When in 1439 both Duke Frederick IV of Further Austria and King Albert II of Germany, Duke of Austria died, Archduke Frederick assumed the guardianship over their minor sons Sigismund and Ladislaus the Posthumous. As Habsburg patriarch, heir of Inner Austria and regent of Further Austria, Tyrol and the Austria proper, he then ruled over all the dynasty&#x27;s hereditary lands. At that stage, Albert began quarreling with his brother and in 1446 claimed the lands of Further Austria from him.
The conflict between the brothers escalated when Duke Ladislaus Posthumous of Austria died childless in 1457 and Frederick, Holy Roman Emperor since 1452, came into his inheritance. Albert rose up and in 1458 occupied the western part of the Austrian archduchy &quot;above the Enns&quot; (later known as Upper Austria), which he ruled at Linz as a separate principality (&quot;Fürstentum Österreich ob der Enns&quot;) and, quite small, his portion of Habsburg patrimony. After laying siege to Frederick in the Vienna Hofburg, he also took over the reign of Austria below the Enns (now Lower Austria) in 1462. Albert however died childless the next year and all his lands fell back to his elder brother.

In 1452 Albert had married Mechthild of the Palatinate, daughter of Count Palatine Louis III. Albert is credited for founding the University of Freiburg in 1457.

<text>Ram Sarup Singh VC (12 April 1919 – 25 October 1944) was an Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 25 years old, born in a Rajput Tunwar family at Village Kheri Talwana, Mahendergarh and a Jemadar (acting Subadar) in the 2nd Battalion, 1st Punjab Regiment, in the British Indian Army when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25 October 1944 at Kennedy Peak in the Tiddim area, Burma (now Myanmar), two platoons were ordered to attack a strong Japanese position. The platoon commanded by Subadar Singh attained its objective and although Singh was wounded in both legs he insisted on carrying on. Later, the enemy&#x27;s counter-attack was halted by Subadar Singh&#x27;s dashing counter-charge in which he killed four of the enemy himself. He was again wounded, but continued to lead his men, killing two more of the enemy, before he was mortally wounded.

The citation reads:

His medals now form part of the Lord Ashcroft VC collection in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Garches () is a commune in the western suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris.

Garches has remained largely residential, with a population of 17,898 as of 2021, but is also the location of Raymond Poincaré University Hospital, which specialises in traumatology, road accidents and physiotherapy.

===19 January Monument===
The northern part of Garches was largely destroyed in the Battle of Buzenval on 19 January 1871, when besieged Parisian forces under Louis Jules Trochu attempted to break through the German blockade and join the French troops at Versailles. Monuments in Rue du 19 janvier and Rue du Colonel de Rochebrune commemorate the events.

===Church of St. Louis===
Construction of the church began in 1298 following the canonisation of St. Louis, as recorded on the plaque at the entrance. It was the first church in France dedicated to St. Louis. The original church was partly destroyed in the Battle of Buzenval; it was rebuilt in 1876 and restored beginning in 1980 with the 19th-century stained-glass windows and continuing in 1983 with the complete restoration and enlargement of the organ. The spire was rebuilt in 1988, the cross reconsecrated in 1989, the carved tympanum restored in 1990, and interior and façade renovation carried out beginning in 1995. A bell dated to 1787 was classified as a historic monument on 27 April 1944.

The cemetery adjacent to the church was moved in 1930 and contains the graves of some well-known people, including jazz musician Sidney Bechet, who chose to spend his last years in Garches.

==Transport==
Garches is served by Garches–Marnes-la-Coquette station on the Transilien Paris-Saint-Lazare suburban rail line and by 9 bus lines linking it with Paris and other suburbs.

<doc id="1220245" wikidata="Q3568771" url="?curid=1220245" title="William Lambarde">
<text>William Lambarde (18 October 1536 – 19 August 1601) was an English antiquarian, writer on legal subjects, and politician. He is particularly remembered as the author of &quot;A Perambulation of Kent&quot; (1576), the first English county history; &quot;Eirenarcha&quot; (1581), a widely read manual on the office and role of justice of the peace; and &quot;Archeion&quot; (completed 1591, though not published until 1635), a discourse that sought to trace the Anglo-Saxon roots of English common law, prerogative and government.

==Early life, education and career==
William Lambarde was born in London on 18 October 1536. His father John Lambarde was a draper who served three times as Master of the Drapers&#x27; Company, an alderman and a sheriff of London. The Manor of Westcombe in Greenwich, demolished in 1725, was their family home.

In 1556, Lambarde was admitted to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, where he studied law. In 1568, with Laurence Nowell&#x27;s encouragement, he published a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws, &quot;Archaionomia&quot;, which was printed by John Day. In the introduction he acknowledged Nowell&#x27;s contribution. This publication included a woodcut map (&quot;Lambardes map&quot;) depicting the seven kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England, which is thought to be the first map of any sort to have been designed, printed and published in England, and which is very likely to have been the work of Laurence Nowell.

In 1570, while Lambarde was courting the daughter of George Multon, he completed his &quot;Perambulation of Kent&quot;, the first English county history. Circulating in manuscript before being printed in 1576, it proved to be very popular, and was published in a second edition in 1596. Lambarde considered writing a similar work for all of Britain, but he set the idea aside when he learned that William Camden was already working on the same project. On 11 September 1570, at age 33, Lambarde married Jane Multon on her 17th birthday. She later died in 1573. He lived in the Manor of St Clere in Ightham. On Laurence Nowell&#x27;s death, he inherited his books and manuscripts, which may have included the manuscript of &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

Lambarde probably served as a Member of Parliament for Aldborough in the Parliament of 1563–1567. He was also a bencher of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and a Justice of the Peace for Kent.

Lambarde founded an almshouse in East Greenwich in 1576. He was appointed Keeper of the Rolls by the Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas Egerton in 1597, and Elizabeth made him Keeper of the Records in the Tower in 1601. He died on 19 August that same year. Shortly before his death he had a conversation with Elizabeth in which she commented obliquely on Essex&#x27;s Rebellion, saying &quot;I am Richard II knowe you not that[?]&quot;, and &quot;this tragedie was fortie times plaied in open streetes &amp; howses&quot;. Her words are often read as a reference to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;, a performance of which was commissioned by Essex&#x27;s followers shortly before the rising.

==Works==
Apart from the works already mentioned, Lambarde wrote &quot;Eirenarcha: Or of the Office of the Justices of Peace&quot; (1581), a manual that became the standard work on the subject. He later completed &quot;Archeion, or, A Discourse upon the High Courts of Justice in England&quot; by 1591, another important legal work. The manuscript circulated widely, and a copy was published without consent by the printer Daniel Frere in 1635. In the same year, Lambarde&#x27;s grandson put out an authorized edition of the work to correct certain errors in Frere&#x27;s version.

==Legacy==
There is a Lambarde archive at Drapers&#x27; Hall.

The Society of Antiquaries of London oversees the William Lambarde Travel Awards, a programme of travel grants to support antiquarian or archaeological research, named in memory of Lambarde and endowed by a bequest from a descendant, Mrs M. E. Lambarde.

<doc id="1220246" wikidata="Q700363" url="?curid=1220246" title="London Straits Convention">
<text>In the London Straits Convention concluded on 13 July 1841 between the Great Powers of Europe at the time—Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Austria and Prussia—the &quot;ancient rule&quot; of the Ottoman Empire was re-established by closing the Turkish Straits (the Bosporus and Dardanelles), which link the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, from all warships whatsoever, barring those of the Sultan&#x27;s allies during wartime. It thus benefited British naval power at the expense of Russia as the latter lacked direct access for its navy to the Mediterranean.

The treaty is one in a series dealing with access to the Bosporus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles. It evolved as a reaction to the secret article in the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi (Unkiar Skelessi), created in 1833, in which the Ottoman Empire guaranteed exclusive use of the straits to Ottoman and Imperial Russian warships in the case of a general war, allowing no &quot;foreign vessels of war to enter therein under any pretext whatsoever&quot;. The modern treaty controlling relations is the Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits from 1936, which is still in force.

==Historical background==
The Straits Convention was an agreement between the major powers to strengthen the Ottoman Empire. It evolved from the earlier Treaty of the Dardanelles, signed between Britain and the Ottomans in 1809.

Beginning in 1831, Egypt, under the leadership of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, was revolting against the Ottoman Empire, resulting in the Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–33). Russian Tsar, Nicholas I, chose to support the Ottomans. In 1833, Russia sent a naval force and troops to support the Ottoman defence of Constantinople. Britain was likewise supporting the Ottoman Empire.

Nevertheless, Russia was then the Ottomans&#x27; principal ally; the two countries signed the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi, which reflected this alliance. The Treaty guaranteed that the Ottomans would close the Straits to foreign warships if and when Russia was under threat, and requested this.

==Negotiations==
Still, the hostility between the Turks and the Egyptians continued in 1839, resulting in the Egyptian–Ottoman War (1839–41). The Egyptians again threatened the Ottoman positions. Lord Palmerston of Britain called for talks with Russia, Austria, and Prussia in London in 1840. This resulted in the Convention of London (1840).

Efforts were made to convince France, which tended to side with Mehmet, to accept a multilateral agreement. This evolved into the Straits Convention of 1841, which included guarantees similar to those of the 1809 Treaty of the Dardanelles, also extending the 1840 Convention of London.

The motivation of Tsar Nicholas I to agree to the closing of the straits has been said to be his uneasiness over the Treaty of &quot;Hünkâr İskelesi&quot;, which he feared might turn the other Great Powers against Russia by creating too close an alliance between him and the Sultan, Abdülmecid I. He also authorised the British Navy to quell the attack on the Ottoman Empire by its former vassal, Muhammad Ali. However, Anglo-Russian tensions over the region remained, leading eventually to the Crimean War.

==Outcomes==

From the British point of view, this convention helped preserve the European balance of power by preventing Russia&#x27;s newly powerful navy from dominating the Mediterranean. From the Russian point of view, the treaty encouraged the aggressive policies of Britain in the region, which would lead to the Crimean War. Different interpretations, as well as history of British-Russian relations in the 1840s, suggest that the Straits Convention &#x27;appeared to establish a new era of harmony&#x27; between both powers, keeping Russian navy out of the Mediterranean and British out of the Black Sea.

While these arrangements forced Tsar Nicholas I to abandon his plans for reducing the Ottoman Empire to complete dependence upon Russia and wresting the control of the Christian countries of the Balkans from the Porte, the Ottoman Empire was not wholly independent after the convention, as it relied on Britain and France for protection.

<text>Lietuvos krepšinio lyga (LKL; ), also known as Betsafe LKL for sponsorship reasons, is the premier professional men&#x27;s club basketball league in Lithuania. It is composed of 10 teams, and it is a member of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation. The best LKL clubs are also annual participants of the top European-wide basketball competitions, including the top-tier level EuroLeague.

On April 22, 1993, the Lietuvos krepšinio asociacija (&quot;English&quot;: Lithuanian Basketball Association) (LKA) was founded. It was the first professional sports organisation in Lithuania. Lietuvos krepšinio lyga was built on the foundation of the LKA. Former basketball player Šarūnas Marčiulionis is named as the founder of the league. He was the first president of the LKL and served from 1993 to 2002. Remigijus Milašius is the current president of the league since 2013. The league&#x27;s headquarters is located in Vilnius.

A total of 28 teams have competed in the LKL since its inception. Only two teams have been crowned champions, with Žalgiris Kaunas winning the title a record 24 times and Rytas Vilnius seven times.

The league is sponsored by Betsafe, the international online sportsbook and casino subsidiary of Swedish gambling giant Betsson, which also sponsors four teams in the league.

==Competition format==
The competition format follows a quadruple round-robin format, which means that during the course of a regular season, which lasts from late September to May, each club plays every other club four times, twice at home and twice away, for a total of 44 games. Teams receive one point for a win, and no points for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, with the eight highest-ranked clubs at the end of the season plays the playoffs and the winner of the playoffs is crowned a champion.

===Promotion and relegation===
A system of promotion and relegation exists between the LKL and the NKL. The lowest placed team in LKL is relegated to the NKL, and the top team from the NKL promoted to LKL. However, the last team that has been promoted from the NKL to the LKL was BC Mažeikiai in the 2014–15 LKL season. No any team has been promoted to the LKL since 2015 because they were unable to meet the league requirements. In the 2021–22 LKL season, for the first time since 2014–15 LKL season, 11 teams played in the league, NKL winner BC Jonava joined the existing 10 teams. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league&#x27;s history:
===Qualifying for European competitions===
Žalgiris directly enters the EuroLeague as a licensed club. The highest-placed team, apart from licensed club Zalgiris, gets an invite to play in the EuroCup. The second and third highest-placed teams, apart from licensed club, get an invite to play in the Basketball Champions League.

==History==

===Foundation and Žalgiris dominance===
The Lithuanian Basketball Association was founded on 22 April 1993, when eight of the strongest Lithuanian basketball clubs&#x27; officials met with representatives of the Šarūnas Marčiulionis basketball fund in Vilnius. The original eight teams were: Žalgiris Kaunas, Atletas Kaunas, Drobė Kaunas, Statyba Vilnius, Olimpas Plungė, BC Šilutė, Lietkabelis Panevėžys and Neptūnas Klaipėda. This association would soon be renamed to Lietuvos krepšinio lyga (LKL) due to legal issues, also announcing there that would start in the upcoming fall. By the end of spring, before the season started, the LKA and their new league accepted two more teams – Lavera Kaunas and NECA Kaunas.

Following the 1993–94 season, the finalists of last season&#x27;s LKAL, Sakalai Vilnius &amp; BC Šiauliai joined the league, while Drobė Kaunas decided to withdraw due to financial difficulties. The 1994–95 season saw the league&#x27;s foreign players emerge as star power, before they were more known to be role players. In the 1995–96 season the league continued to accept the champions of the LKAL to the league, Savy Alytus joined the league. Sharpshooter Joe Vickery became the first foreigner to lead the LKL in scoring for Olimpas. League officials would start pressuring teams to play in better arenas by setting up certain criteria that were necessary to get accepted into the league. That&#x27;s why no more teams were accepted until 1998 when Olimpas Plungė went bankrupt and was replaced by BC Kraitienė based in Marijampolė. Some of the strongest teams like Šilutė and Atletas faded away to the bottom of the league and left the league.

During this time period, the league had been dominated by Žalgiris. They won the league&#x27;s championship trophy for six consecutive years, from 1994 through 1999. Their main rival during those years was Atletas Kaunas led by Saulius Štombergas and a young Žydrūnas Ilgauskas acquired from Žalgiris&#x27; youth team. Ilgauskas was selected 20th overall in the 1996 NBA draft, making him the first NBA player coming straight from the LKL. In 1999 Žalgiris, led by Tyus Edney, became the first Lithuanian team to win the top European basketball competition, the EuroLeague title.

===Golden era of Lithuanian basketball===
In the 1999–2000 season, Lietuvos rytas shocked defending EuroLeague champions Žalgiris by ending their dominant run. That sparked most likely the biggest rivalry in Lithuanian sports, the competitiveness has brought over to politics and society between the two biggest cities in Lithuania.

===Modern era===
2010–11 saw Žalgiris reclaim the title, beating Lietuvos rytas 4–1. In the finals of 2012 Žalgiris was the winner again, by sweeping Lietuvos Rytas 3–0. During the 2013–14 season, Žalgiris defeated Neptūnas in the final.

The 2014–2015 season saw the introduction of the &#x27;four wheel system&#x27;, where all the teams have to play 40 games with no exceptions for teams competing in international competition like in the past. This year Žalgiris was able to finished 1st, but not before a dramatic win against Lietuvos rytas in the last game of the season 82–81.

Žalgiris continued to dominate in the playoffs sweeping rivals Lietuvos rytas once again in the final. Despite a familiar ending, the season was marked by the growing competitiveness of the league, Neptūnas joined Žalgiris and Lietuvos rytas as a powerhouse and this edition saw a couple of upsets and close games from teams such as Pieno žvaigždės and Juventus Utena. Although a strong competitor Prienai had an underwhelming season. However, the final saw a two usual suspects once again - Žalgiris and Lietuvos Rytas. The Greens once again took the trophy back home by beating rivals 4–0. Team from Kaunas was led by all around sharpshooters in James Anderson and Artūras Milaknis who averaged 15.3 and 14.3 points a piece. The latter was named the MVP of the finals.

Six 2015–16 LKL season teams participated in the European tournaments: Žalgiris (EuroLeague), Lietuvos rytas and Neptūnas (EuroCup), Juventus, Pieno žvaigždės, Šiauliai (FIBA Europe Cup). Lietkabelis, Vytautas and Nevėžis competed in the Baltic Basketball League. Dzūkija was the only LKL club not participating in any European or regional tournaments. The off-season moves by teams such as the rebranded Prienai (Vytautas Prienai–Birštonas), Lietkabelis and the continued work from last season&#x27;s playoff seeds gave fans hope for one of the most competitive seasons in league history. During the season, Žalgiris won 1st place in the regular season, over Lietuvos rytas. In the playoffs, Neptūnas shocked everyone, by beating Rytas in the semifinals, and reaching the finals for the second time in club history. In the finals, Žalgiris beat Neptūnas 4–1 to win again.

The 2016–17 LKL season off-season saw the rise of Lietkabelis, as tensions between FIBA and the EuroLeague resulted into them receiving a wild card as replacement in the EuroCup and greatly improving their roster which included signing the Lavrinovič twins (Darjuš and Kšyštof). A record of 8 Lithuanian teams competed in a European tournament that season, which added to the ever-improving competitiveness of the league. Consequently, the LKL achieved the average attendance record, with more than 2,000 spectators per game, during the regular season. Only Lietkabelis was able to fight defending champion Žalgiris, as Žalgiris easily defeated other top contenders Lietuvos rytas and Neptūnas. In the LKL semifinals, Lietkabelis beat Lietuvos rytas 3–1, to advance to the finals for the first time - they lost to Žalgiris 4–1. Rytas won the third place over Neptūnas.

In the 2018–19 LKL season, Dainius Adomaitis, the coach of the Lithuania men&#x27;s national basketball team, joined the renamed BC Rytas as the new head coach. During the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification, happening during the season, many LKL players debuted in the national team to play the games. BC Vytautas was renamed as BC SkyCop Prienai, signing veteran players like the Lavrinovič twins, Mindaugas Lukauskis and others. The team played improved basketball and reached the playoffs. Rytas won the King Mindaugas Cup, while BC Neptūnas finished the regular season in second place, earning home-court advantage for the semifinals for the first time in club history. Žalgiris once again won 1st place in the regular season. In the playoffs, while Žalgiris and Lietkabelis beat their opponents in sweeps, Rytas struggled against BC Juventus, 2–1, while Neptūnas defeated SkyCop 2–1. In the semifinals, Žalgiris easily swept Lietkabelis 2–0, while Rytas shocked Neptūnas with an even easier 2–0 sweep, even without home-court advantage. Setting up rematches from the previous year, the results remained the same - Neptūnas once again defeated Lietkabelis 3–0 in the 3rd place series, while Žalgiris easily defeated Rytas 3–0 in the finals.

During the 2019–20 season, the LKL board ended the season prematurely due to the coronavirus outbreak and crowned Žalgiris champions.

In the 2020–21 LKL season the LKL has reached a historic agreement - LKL will be broadcast in foreign countries for the first time since its establishment. During the 2020–21 LKL season, it was decided that in the next 2021–22 LKL season, 11 teams will participate in the tournament again after 6 years. BC Jonava joined the other 10 existing LKL teams by winning the 2020–21 NKL season. For the 2022–23 season, the number of teams was further increased to 12, with the addition of the 2021–22 NKL champions Gargždai-SC.

During 2022–23 LKL season it was announced that the new team 2022–23 NKL season runner-up Mažeikiai M Basket will join other existing teams in LKL. Mažeikiai M Basket will take place of Labas Gas because they finished in last place in 2022–23 LKL season and were relegated to NKL.

<doc id="1220250" wikidata="Q3078407" url="?curid=1220250" title="Ajyad Fortress">
<text>The Ajyad Fortress (, ; ) was an Ottoman citadel which stood on a hill overlooking the Grand Mosque of Mecca, in what is now Saudi Arabia. Built in the late 18th century, it was demolished by the Saudi government in 2002 for commercial development of the Abraj Al Bait, sparking outcry from Turkey and other concerned Muslims of the world.

==History==
The fortress was built in 1780 under Ottoman rule (later Hejaz vilayet) to protect the Kaaba in Mecca from bandits and invaders. The fort covered some on Bulbul Mountain (a spur of Jebel Kuda) overlooking the Masjid al-Haram from the south. The Ottoman Empire ruled a vast empire covering the Arabian Peninsula, the Balkans, and North Africa. However, the empire disintegrated at the beginning of the 20th century and present-day Turkey was established as a secular state.

From 1 to 9 January 2002 the Ajyad Fortress was demolished and most of Bulbul mount was leveled, to clear the area for the $15 billion construction project.

==Reactions==

The destruction of the historic structure stirred both domestic and international protest. The Turkish Foreign Minister İsmail Cem İpekçi as well as several institutions tried to prevent the demolition. The Turkish Democratic Left Party (DSP) Deputy Ertuğrul Kumcuoğlu even suggested a boycott on travelling to Saudi Arabia. The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism condemned the obliteration of the fortress, comparing the act to the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan, and accusing the Saudi authorities of &quot;continuing with their policy of demolishing Ottoman heritage sites&quot;.

The French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Saudi Islamic affairs Minister Saleh al-Shaikh as saying &quot;no-one has the right to interfere in what comes under the state&#x27;s authority&quot;. In reference to the housing component of the plan, al-Sheikh added that it was intended to house pilgrims to Mecca, and said &quot;this is in the interest of Muslims all over the world&quot;. Arab commenters are dismissive of the protests against the destruction, and ascribed them to a residual bitterness on the loss of the Arabian peninsula by the Ottoman Empire.

However, the destruction of this and other historic sites fueled criticism of the Saudis, and plans were made to rebuild the castle, as ordered by the King in 2001:
A scale model of the fortress is included along with other architectural models at the Miniatürk miniature park in Istanbul, Turkey.

<doc id="1220251" wikidata="Q7707748" url="?curid=1220251" title="Texas House Bill 588">
<text>Texas House Bill 588, commonly referred to as the &quot;Top 10% Rule&quot;, is a Texas law passed in 1997. It was signed into law by then governor George W. Bush on May 20, 1997. The law guarantees Texas students who graduated in the top ten percent of their high school class automatic admission to all state-funded universities.
== Legislative Background ==
The bill was created as a means to avoid the stipulations from the &quot;Hopwood v. Texas&quot; appeals court case banning the use of affirmative action. The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot; (2003) that affirmative action in college admissions was permissible, effectively overruling &quot;Hopwood&quot;. UT Austin then reinstated affirmative action for the seats not filled by the Top Ten Percent law.

The law only guarantees &quot;admission&quot; into university. Students must still find the means to pay, and may not achieve their desired choice of major. (Another existing law, which preceded 588, provides a full tuition scholarship for the class valedictorian of a Texas high school for their freshman year at a state public school.)
== Development ==
The Texas &quot;Top 10% Plan&quot; is a transition from a race-based policy known as affirmative action. When affirmative action was banned, university administrators needed to provide an alternative in order to increase the number of minority students who qualify and apply for admission. Subsequently, the Top 10% law came into existence, it is an alternative educational reform that attempts to provide students with post-secondary incentives that influence their behavior in High School. This policy extends access to Texas&#x27;s elite flagship universities to students in schools with weak college-going traditions and encourages student engagement across the state by connecting postsecondary opportunities to high school behavior.

== Responses ==
The law has drawn praise and criticism alike. Supporters of the rule argue that it ensures geographic and ethnic diversity in public universities. They also point out that students admitted under the legislation performed better in college than their counterparts. The law has been blamed for keeping students not in the top ten percent but with other credentials, such as high SAT scores or leadership and extracurricular experience, out of the larger &quot;flagship&quot; state universities, such as the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&amp;M University, College Station. UT-Austin has argued for several years that the law has come to account for too many of its entering students, with 81 percent of the 2008 freshmen having enrolled under it.

== Policy Changes ==
Some administrators, such as former University of Texas at Austin President Larry Faulkner, have advocated capping the number of top ten percent students for any year at one-half of the incoming class. However, until May 2009 the Texas Legislature had not revised the law in any way since its inception. A 2007 measure (HB78) was introduced during the 80th Regular Session (2007) but never made it out of committee.

Under legislation approved in May 2009 by the Texas House as part of the 81st Regular Session (Senate Bill 175), UT-Austin (but no other state universities) was allowed to trim the number of students it accepts under the 10 percent rule; UT-Austin could limit those students to 75 percent of entering in-state freshmen from Texas. The University would admit the top 1 percent, the top 2 percent, and so forth until the cap is reached, beginning with the 2011 entering class. UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa and UT-Austin President William Powers Jr. had sought a cap of about 50 percent, but lawmakers (led by Representatives Dan Branch (R-Dallas) and Rep. Mike Villarreal (D-San Antonio)) brokered the compromise.

== Studies ==
A study in 2011 found that the law created a strategic incentive for students to transfer to a high school with lower-achieving peers, in order to graduate in that school&#x27;s top decile. Students would reduce their labor supply, change living arrangements, and move to new jurisdictions in order to strategically place themselves at schools where they were more likely to be top of their class. The consequence of this behavior is that this may result in crowding out some of the automatic admissions slots that would have gone to disadvantaged and minority students. 

A 2023 study found that the law improved educational and economic outcomes for top students from non-elite high schools while the non-top students at the prestigious high schools did not experience worse educational and economic outcomes.

<text>John Crawshaw Raynes VC (28 April 1887 – 12 November 1929) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Raynes, from Sheffield in the West Riding of Yorkshire, joined the Royal Horse and Field Artillery in 1904 and served until 1912, then joined the Leeds police force. However, he was still suffering from the effects of gas poisoning contracted during his VC action and struggled to continue his duties as a policeman, eventually being forced to take a desk job.

==Details==
He was 28 years old, and an Acting Sergeant in the &#x27;A&#x27; Battery 71 Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 11 October 1915 at Fosse 7 de Bethune, France, Sergeant Raynes went to the assistance of another sergeant who was lying wounded. He bandaged the injured man and returned to his gun, then, when the battery ceased firing, carried the wounded man to a dug-out and when gas shelling started, put his own gas helmet on his injured comrade and, badly gassed himself, went back to his gun. The next day he was buried, with others, under a house which had been shelled. As soon as he had been extricated he insisted on helping to rescue the others, then, having had his wounds dressed, reported for duty. The medal is in the collection of the Royal Artillery Museum.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of Battery Sergeant Major.

On his death the following was noted:
His funeral took place in the presence of nineteen Victoria Cross recipients, eight of which were Yorkshire VC. Holders. The Yorkshire VC’s were; Captain George Sanders, Lieutenant Wilfred Edwards, Sergeant Fred McNess, Sergeant Charles Smith Hull, Sergeant Albert Mountain, Lance Corporal Frederick W Dobson, Private Arthur Poulter, Private William Boynton Butler who were acting as pallbearers. The 71st Field Brigade Royal Artillery provided the gun carriage that carried the coffin of Mr Raynes, followed by the chairman of the LEEDS “Old Contemptibles Association”, Captain W.E. Gage, carrying a purple cushion with JCR’s medals upon it a wreath of Flanders poppies and evergreen in the shape of a Victoria Cross was carried by Lieutenant Edwards.
The wreath was intended as a souvenir for JCR from the VC Dinner at the House of Lords. The wreath bore the message “In affectionate memory from brother VC’s of Leeds, who sorely missed their comrade at the Prince of Wales’s dinner, whence this emblem was brought for him.” Mr Raynes was intended to go to the dinner but he had to give his apologies, he asked if his son John Kenneth, age 18 would be able to take his place.

Mr Raynes received a telegram on Armistice Day from the other Yorkshire VC’s who attended the dinner, stating that they regretted that he could not attend and complete the party, sending their greetings. They promised him a memento of the dinner, (the VC shaped wreath). The service was held at St Clement’s Church, with the Lord and Lady Mayor and the Chief Constable in attendance, along with a squad of police.

He was buried at Harehills Cemetery, Leeds. A firing squad was arranged and provided by the West Yorkshire Regiment and the Last Post was sounded. The cemetery gates had to be closed due to the number of people that were there to pay their respects, an estimated 25 to 30,000. So was the popularity of this brave man.

<text>Ferbane (; ) is a town in County Offaly, Ireland. It is on the north bank of the River Brosna, between Birr and Athlone at the junction of the N62 and R436 roads, 20 km south of Athlone. The name of the town is said to come from the white bog cotton which grows in the surrounding Bog of Allen.

Ireland&#x27;s first milled-peat fired power station was commissioned by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) at Ferbane in 1957. Since the station&#x27;s closure in 2001, the Shannon Development agency and the ESB have invested €1.4 million in a new business and technology park which opened in 2005.

==History==

===Coole Castle===
Sir John MaCoghlan built Coole Castle on the banks of the Brosna in 1575. It was the last of the MacCoghlan castles to be built. He erected it as a present to his second wife Sabina O&#x27;Dallachain. Formerly, there was a mural slab in the castle with a Latin inscription translated in English as &quot;“This tower was built by the energy of Sir John MacCoghlan, K.T. chief of this Sept at the proper cost of Sabina O&#x27;Dallachain on the condition that she should have it for her lifetime and afterwards each of her sons according to their seniority&quot;.

The whereabouts of the mural is unknown at present.
In his will in 1590, Sir John left Coole Castle to his widow. Over the fireplace, in its original location, in the topmost room of the castle is a plaque written in Middle Irish which reads:

&quot;SEAGHA (n) MAC (c) OCHL (ain) DO
TINDSCAIN O SEO SUAS 1575&quot;
(&quot;Sean Mac Cochlan began (this building) from this (date) 1575&quot;)

===Kilcolgan Castle (Court)===
Terence Coghlan built Kilcolgan Castle in the early 1640s. In 1646, the Papal Nuncio was sent to Ireland; he stayed for some time in the castle and wrote admiringly of the castle demesne with its beautifully laid out gardens and peacocks strutting on the lawns. The castle continued to be in the possession of the MacCoghlans until the 18th century when it became uninhabited and fell into disrepair. The remains of the castle were demolished in 1954 and the stones used to make foundations for the power station at Lumcloon.

===Gallen Priory===

Less than a kilometre south of the town, on the site of an ancient monastery founded by the Welsh missionary Saint Canoc in 492, stands Gallen Priory (formerly a convent of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Cluny, now a nursing home).

== Education ==
All of Ferbane&#x27;s primary and secondary schools have a Catholic ethos and are regulated by the Department of Education through the national curriculum. These include St Cynoc&#x27;s National School, a national (primary) school which was founded in 2007 through the amalgamation of St Mary&#x27;s Boys&#x27; National School and St Mary&#x27;s Girls&#x27; National School.

Gallen Community School is the local secondary school and has been in existence since 2004 following the amalgamation of two former schools in the town. The school was newly rebuilt in 2011 under the DES Public Private Partnership scheme.

==Community and sport==
Ferbane GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. Tony McTague, a Gaelic footballer with the club, was on the Offaly senior team that won the 1971 All-Ireland and 1972 All-Ireland championships. He was Offaly captain in 1972.

Gallen Community School&#x27;s senior team has won two All Ireland titles (in 2011 and 2016).

In October 2007, 142 residents of the Ferbane area gathered to participate in a globally simultaneous dance to the music of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;.

==Transport==
Ferbane is serviced by two bus routes. These include Bus Éireann route 72 (between Athlone and Limerick) and TFI Local Link route 9990 (between Ballycumber and Moate).

The closest train stations to Ferbane are Clara (17 km) and Athlone (19 km). Ferbane&#x27;s former railway station (which opened in 1884), closed for passenger traffic in 1947 and closed fully in 1963.

The Grand Canal, which links up with the River Shannon, passes through Gallen townland.

==Amenity areas==
An area of Ferbane industrial park is known locally as the Cow Park as it was once a municipal grazing area. A nearby forested area has a short walking trail along the mill race and a footpath through a predominantly oak-forest.

Other walking trails include the Offaly Way, a national waymarked trail which runs close to Ferbane town. It is a 37 km route that starts at Lemanaghan and finishes at Cadamstown. Lough Boora Discovery Park also has walking trails up to 22 km.

In May 2023, a boardwalk on Ferbane Bog was opened; The raised bog is known locally as Ballylin Bog. According to a representative of the Ferbane Tidy Towns, a link between Ballylin Bog and the Cow Park woodland, through a green corridor of native tree planting, is also proposed.

==Library==
Ferbane has a public library with children&#x27;s and adults&#x27; sections. The library has computer access, printing services and free wifi.

<text>MacWeb is an early, now discontinued classic Mac OS-only web browser for 68k and PowerPC Apple Macintosh computers, developed by TradeWave (formerly EINet) between 1994 and 1996.

MacWeb&#x27;s major attraction was its ability to run well on low-end hardware footprints as well as fast page display. This compactness led to MacWeb&#x27;s inclusion on many &quot;Internet starter kit&quot; floppy disks and CD-ROMs that were popular at the time. TradeWave also developed a similar Microsoft Windows browser named WinWeb. However, they were eclipsed by more full-featured competitors such as Netscape Navigator, and development was eventually abandoned.

==Versions==
The first public release was 0.98-alpha on May 31, 1994, and the final official release was version 2.0 in 1996. An unofficial patch &quot;2.0c&quot; was released by Antoine Hébert in 1998 to correct a problem on old machines not supporting color QuickDraw.

Although one author in 1995 called MacWeb the second web browser released for the Macintosh, this is not quite true. The text-only MacWWW browser became available in 1992, with the graphical Mosaic released for the Mac the next year.

==Features==
MacWeb was a basic browser that contained features common to most browsers such as:

* support for HTML forms
* bookmarks with import tool for Mosaic&#x27;s bookmarks
* a HTML viewer

MacWeb pioneered the &quot;click and hold&quot; gesture to display a popup contextual menu. This mouse gesture was commonly used on the Macintosh before the prevalence of two-button mice on the Mac platform. MacWeb&#x27;s preferences dialog allowed users to customize display styles on a per-tag basis similar to Cascading style sheets

==System requirements==
MacWeb has the following system requirements:
* Operating system: Classic Mac OS
* RAM: less than 700 KB RAM
* HDD: 680 KB

<text>Ajyad () is a historic neighborhood of Mecca in Makkah Province, in western Saudi Arabia. Ajya is directly south of Al Haram District.

==Description==
Also known as Ajyad Al-Sagheer, the Ajyad al-Saghir, or Ajyad al-Sad, the street starts from the first Ajyad Gate and runs a turn north-east and ends with the Khtunda seal between Ajyad and the people of Abu Yusuf. The Department of Health lies to the south-east. Among the most famous quarters of the Ajyad neighborhood are the Umayyad background and the companions Muawiyah bin Abi Sufyan.

The Abraj Al Bait is on the western boundary of the neighbourhood and the Al Haram district is on the northern boundary of the neighborhood.

==Literature==
The Agyad is mentioned in the poetry of Al-Ashi bin Maimon bin Qais, saying.
فما أنت من أهل الحجون ولا الصفا ولا لك حق الشرب من ماء زمزم &lt;br&gt;ولا جعل الرحمن بيتك في العلا بأجياد غربي الصفا والمحرم 
English Translation: &quot;So what are you of the people of Hajjun and Safa, and you have the right to drink from Zamzam water. And do not make the Rahman your home in the Aalaa Ajyad west of Safa and Mahram.&quot;

==Council==
Ajyad is the seat of the Municipality of Ajyad Sub () which extends from the &quot;People of Amer north and to the King Abdul Aziz Tunnels in the east and to Ibrahim al-Khalil Street in the west. It once contained the Ajyad Fortress.

<text>Thomas Reeves VC (1828 – 4 August 1862) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Reeves was approximately 26 years old, and a seaman in the Royal Navy serving with the Naval Brigade during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 5 November 1854 at the Battle of Inkerman, Crimean Peninsula, when the Right Lancaster Battery was attacked and many of the soldiers were wounded, Seaman Reeves, with two other seamen (James Gorman and Mark Scholefield) and two others who were killed during the action, mounted the defence work banquette and, under withering attack from the enemy, kept up a rapid, repulsing fire. Their muskets were re-loaded for them by the wounded soldiers under the parapet and eventually the enemy fell back and gave no more trouble.

He later achieved the rank of captain of the foretop and died of consumption in August 1862. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Junkhouse was a Canadian rock band, formed during 1989 in Hamilton, Ontario. They released three albums during the 1990s, which spawned numerous charting singles in Canada. They initially disbanded in 1998, and have performed occasional one-off shows afterwards.

==History==

Formed in 1989 in Hamilton, Ontario, the band consisted of vocalist and guitarist Tom Wilson, guitarist Dan Achen, bassist Russ Wilson (no relation to Tom), and drummer Ray Farrugia.

The band got its first widespread exposure opening for Crash Vegas on that band&#x27;s tour to support their debut album, &quot;Red Earth&quot;. Crash Vegas member Colin Cripps was one of Junkhouse&#x27;s early mentors and supporters. In 1993, the band signed to Sony Music, and released a Sony Music publishing demo &quot;Here Lies Happiness&quot;, which was a collection of their early recordings. The band was then moved to Sony&#x27;s Epic Records division. In September 1993 they released their official debut, &quot;Strays&quot;, and promoted the album by touring as an opening act for The Waltons and Soul Asylum. That album was produced by Malcolm Burn, and produced radio hits for the band with &quot;Out of My Head&quot;, &quot;Praying for the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Big Brown Turtle&quot; all charting on RPM&#x27;s Top Singles chart. The band was also featured on the soundtrack to the television show &quot;Due South&quot;. Their cover of the song &quot;Oh, What a Feeling&quot; is the first track on the second of the two soundtrack albums from the Paul Haggis show. &quot;Gimme the Love&quot; did reach #1 on RPM&#x27;s CanCon chart, October 3, 1994.

In 1995, they released their second album &quot;Birthday Boy&quot;, which included a duet with Sarah McLachlan on the song &quot;Burned Out Car&quot;. The lead single &quot;Be Someone&quot; had peaked at #17 on RPM&#x27;s Top Singles chart, their highest position on the chart. Bassist Russ Wilson left the band in 1996, and was replaced by Grant Marshall. In 1997, Colin Cripps joined the band after the dissolution of Crash Vegas. He played as the second guitarist and also keyboardist.

Junkhouse released their final album, &quot;Fuzz&quot;, which was primarily written by Wilson and Cripps. Although the band stayed with Sony, they were moved from Epic Records onto Columbia Records for the album. Both singles off of the album, &quot;Pearly White&quot; and &quot;Shine&quot;, had reached the top 10 of RPM&#x27;s Alternative 30 chart. Following &quot;Fuzz&quot;, the band members went their separate ways. A compilation, &quot;Rounders: The Best of Junkhouse&quot;, was released in 2002 by Sony. Although no longer recording, the band performed together occasionally. They played on a bill with Finger Eleven at a tsunami benefit in Hamilton on February 2, 2005. and reunited on November 7, 2009 to celebrate its 20th anniversary with a concert at Toronto&#x27;s Horseshoe Tavern.

Tom Wilson released two solo albums, &quot;Planet Love&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Dog Years&quot; in 2006. He has collaborated with Stephen Fearing and Colin Linden in the supergroup Blackie and the Rodeo Kings, in which Russ Wilson also guested on their 2006 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Frolic&quot;. Tom Wilson, along with Ray Farrugia, had also formed the band Lee Harvey Osmond in 2009. Colin Cripps became involved in numerous bands such as C and C Surf Factory and Blue Rodeo. 

Dan Achen owned Catherine North Studio in Hamilton. Several internationally known artists have recorded at Catherine North over the past 10 years, including Achen&#x27;s niece Feist. At a 2008 concert at Hamilton Place, the Grammy-nominated singer held up her favorite red guitar and proudly announced that it was a gift from &quot;Uncle Dan&quot;. In 2008, Achen co-produced the Juno-winning album &quot;Bring Me Your Love&quot;, a solo project by Dallas Green of the platinum-selling rock band Alexisonfire.

Dan Achen died on March 15, 2010, of a heart attack while playing hockey. His funeral was attended by friends and family, including his former bandmates in Junkhouse. On March 20, 2010, Ron McLean profiled Dan Achen and Junkhouse with a segment prior to the Leafs-Canadiens game on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;.

Russ Wilson died at home on March 13, 2024, at age 62.

<text>Harry Garnet Bedford Miner VC (24 June 1891 – 8 August 1918) was a soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War and posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He earned the award for events that occurred during the Battle of Amiens in August 1918. There are two plaques in his memory in his hometown, Cedar Springs, Ontario and his medals are displayed in a local museum.

==Early life==
Harry Garnet Bedford Miner was born at Cedar Springs in Ontario, on 24 June 1891, the son of John and Orphra Miner. He was educated in Selton and at Highgate School in Oxford Township. After finishing his education, he took up farming. He lived for a time in the United States, first in Ohio and then Detroit.

==First World War==
In November 1915, after the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted in the Canadian Army. He volunteered for the Canadian Expeditionary Force and was posted to the 142nd Battalion. Arriving in England at the end of October 1916 as a lance corporal, he was transferred to the 161st Battalion. Then, after a period of training, he was sent to the Western Front and taken onto the strength of the 58th Battalion, part of 9th Brigade, 3rd Canadian Division. In early 1918, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his actions as a leader of a wiring party late the previous year. He was also promoted to corporal.

On 8 August 1918, the opening day of the Battle of Amiens, and the beginning of the Hundred Days Offensive, the 9th Brigade was engaged in fighting at Rifle Wood and then near Demuin. It was at the latter location that he performed the actions that led to his recommendation for the Victoria Cross (VC). He was involved in attacks on two machinegun positions and then a bombing post, and was severely wounded in the process. He died later that day of his injuries. The citation for his VC read:

Miner was buried in the Crouy Military Cemetery just outside the village of Crouy-Saint-Pierre, about 15 kilometers northwest of Amiens and about 25 km northwest of the battlefield on which he fell.

==The medal==
Miner&#x27;s medals, including the VC and the Croix de Guerre, are on display at Huron County Museum in Goderich, Ontario. There is a plaque to his memory in his hometown of Cedar Springs; it was unveiled on 22 September 1963 by his brother Ross Miner. There is another plaque to him in the United Church at Cedar Springs. Branch 185 of the Royal Canadian Legion in Blenheim, Ontario, is named the Harry Miner Branch. Branch 140 of the Royal Canadian Legion in Clinton, Ontario is also named after him.
