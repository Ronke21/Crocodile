<text>This list of Cornell University alumni includes notable graduates, non-graduate former students, and current students of Cornell University, an Ivy League university whose main campus is in Ithaca, New York.

As of 2024, Cornell has over 250,000 living alumni. Since the university&#x27;s founding, its alumni have included 25 recipients of National Medal of Science and National Medal of Technology and Innovation combined, 38 MacArthur Fellows, 34 Marshall Scholars, 31 Rhodes Scholars, 249 elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, 201 elected members of the National Academy of Engineering, and over 190 heads of higher learning institutions.

Cornell is the only university in the world with three female winners of unshared Nobel Prizes among its graduates; Cornell alumni Pearl S. Buck, Barbara McClintock, and Toni Morrison each were unshared recipients of the prize. Many alumni maintain university ties through the university&#x27;s homecoming. Its alumni magazine is &quot;Cornell Magazine&quot;. In Manhattan, the university maintains the Cornell Club of New York for alumni. In 2005, Cornell ranked third nationally among universities and colleges in philanthropic giving from its alumni. Alumni are known as &quot;Cornellians&quot;, many of whom are noted for their accomplishments in public, professional, and corporate life.

In contemporary culture, fictional alumni have been portrayed in several films, television shows, and books. In television, Andy Bernard on &quot;The Office&quot; (2005 to 2013), Gary Walsh on &quot;Veep&quot; (2012 to 2019), Tom Kirkman on &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; (2016 to 2018), Mitchell Pritchett on &quot;Modern Family&quot; (2009 to 2020), Tom Wambsgans on &quot;Succession&quot; (2018 to 2023), Shane Patton on HBO&#x27;s &quot;The White Lotus&quot; (2021 to present), and Deborah &quot;DJ&quot; Vance Jr. on &quot;Hacks&quot; (2021 to present) are each Cornell University alumni.

<text>Major James Edward Ignatius Masterson VC (20 June 1862 – 24 December 1935) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early career==
He was born the son of Elizabeth Christina and her husband Thomas, a soldier of the 2nd Battalion, 21st Foot, who served from 1850 to 1872. During this time, the family lived in Ireland, India and Burma. His father became quartermaster for the 3rd Militia Battalion on 1 April 1878, and the family resided at Hounslow Barracks at the time of the 1881 census. 

Masterson enlisted at Aldershot in the Royal Irish Fusiliers on 25 August 1881, and served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, including the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir. 

He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Devonshire Regiment on 15 July 1891, served from 1891 to 1892 in operations to pacify Burma, and was promoted to lieutenant on 16 April 1895. From 1897 to 1898 he served with the 1st battalion of his regiment in the Tirah Campaign in the North-West Frontier of India under Sir William Lockhart.

==Second Boer War==
The Second Boer War broke out in South Africa in October 1899, and the British government soon realized they would need more troops. Masterson arrived in late 1899 with the 1st battalion of his regiment, and were involved in the Relief of Ladysmith.

===Victoria Cross===
Masterson was 37 years old, and a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, Devonshire Regiment, when the following deed took place on 6 January 1900, at Wagon Hill, Ladysmith, South Africa for which he was awarded the VC:
He was severely wounded during the action, and placed in a field hospital. In February 1900 he was promoted to captain (the appointment was dated back to 1 January 1900). After returning to active service, he received a brevet promotion to major on 29 November 1900 (gazetted in a 1901 South Africa Honours list), and stayed in South Africa until after the war formally ended in June 1902. His regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion had transferred to British India, and Masterson left Point Natal on the SS &quot;Ionian&quot; in November 1902 to join it at Ranikhet, Bengal Presidency.

==Later career==
He transferred to the King&#x27;s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment as a Major in 1911 and retired in 1912. In 1914 he returned to the Army. He failed the medical inspection and was deemed unfit for active service overseas. Nonetheless, he served for five years as a deputy director of Railway Transport, administrative services and departments, on the Embarkation &amp; Transport staff. He was at Military Embarkation Port No.1, Southampton Docks.

His father, Thomas, born in Portsmouth, relocated here in the 1890s. He, as his son, took up residence in nearby Waterlooville in 1902. He died at Waterlooville, Hampshire, England, on 24 December 1935, aged 73.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Keep Military Museum of Devon and Dorset, Dorchester, Dorset, England.

His great grandfather, Sergeant Patrick Masterson of the 87th Foot, captured a Napoleonic eagle at the Battle of Barossa in 1811 and was given a field commission; this is portrayed in Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Fury&quot;. A spectacle akin to a Royal Tournament, The Army Pageant held in 1910 at Fulham Palace, saw a re-enactment of this feat, with Masterson portraying the Sergeant.

<text>Illinois Route 2 (IL 2) is a north–south state highway in northern Illinois. It currently starts at Illinois Route 40 in Sterling and ends at the Wisconsin state line in South Beloit, very near the intersection with U.S. Route 51, Illinois Route 75 and Illinois Route 251. Illinois 2 is long.

== Route description ==
Illinois 2 used to follow the Rock River from Rock Island to South Beloit. It was used in the 19th century as a primary trading route from Rockford to Rock Island, The Rock River was not used as a trading route for boats as it is only navigable west of Rock Falls.

Illinois 2 has since been superseded by Interstate 39 and Interstate 88 for most ground transportation, but the original route remains.

In Sterling, IL 2 begins as a one-way pair. Near the Sinnissippi Mounds, the two one-way roads merge into a two-way road. From Sterling to Dixon, IL 2 largely follows a portion of Lincoln Highway but with one exception. Lincoln Highway branches off northeast to Palmyra and then back southeast to IL 2 just northwest of Dixon. Just north of Dixon, both routes run concurrently with US 52 and IL 26. They then cross the Rock River to get to downtown. In downtown, IL 2 branches off northeast from the other two routes.

At Grand Detour, IL 2 transitions from following the south/east bank of Rock River to the north/west bank via a bridge. Further north, it passes through Castle Rock State Park, IL 64 at the Ogle County Courthouse in Oregon, and IL 72 in Byron (runs concurrently with IL 2). North of the Chicago Rockford International Airport, IL 2 turns north. At this point, it largely parallels IL 251 for the rest of the route which is east of the river. It then meets US 20 at a diamond interchange (formerly a cloverleaf interchange).

As IL 2 gets closer to downtown Rockford, another split occurs. Northbound traffic continues on Main Street, then east on Chestnut Street (US 20 Business), then north on Wyman Street, then west on Park Avenue near the site of Beattie Park Mound Group, and then back north on Main Street before merging. Southbound traffic has to turn west onto John Street, then south on Church Street, and then east on Cedar Street before merging.

In Rockton, IL 2 transitions from the west side of the river to the east side again. Further north, IL 75 runs concurrently with IL 2 from Rockton to South Beloit. One third of a mile from the Wisconsin state line, IL 75 leaves this concurrency to travel East while IL 2 continues North over a railroad grade crossing and Turtle Creek before reaching its Northern terminus at a junction with WIS 213.

== History ==

SBI Route 2 originally ran from South Beloit to Cairo. It followed a part of current IL 2 from South Beloit to Dixon. It then followed south on (roughly) present-day US 52, IL 251, and US 51. In 1935, US 51 supplanted IL 2 south of Mendota. With the appearance of US 52 in 1936, IL 2 was removed south of Dixon. Then, in 1938, IL 2 was briefly extended to Muscatine, Iowa, replacing IL 84 and IL 86 in the process. It soon got cut back to Rock Island in 1939 after IL 92 was extended to Muscatine. By 1979, IL 2 was removed west of Sterling as Illinois Route 5 (now I-88 east of I-80) was extended to Rock Island. To this day, exit 2 on I-88 is designated as &quot;Old IL 2&quot;, referencing the pre-1979 routing of IL 2.

IL 2 was designated a Blue Star Memorial Highway on November 4, 1970. The sign can be found in a wayside just west of the Winnebago County line in Ogle County along the Rock River.

<text>David Jones VC (10 January 1892 – 7 October 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with The King&#x27;s (Liverpool) Regiment during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions in September 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. He was killed in action several days later.

==Early life==
David Jones was born in Liverpool on 10 January 1892 to David Jones, a trained ironworker but working as a porter at the time, and Jessie Jones . The youngest of six siblings, Jones went to Heyworth Street School in Everton. When he finished his schooling, he was apprenticed to Blake&#x27;s Motor Company to train as a mechanic. In 1909, he volunteered for the Territorial Force and served in the 9th King&#x27;s (Liverpool) Regiment for four years.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, Jones enlisted in the British Army, and was posted to the 12th Battalion, The King&#x27;s (Liverpool) Regiment. After a period of training, he, along with the battalion as part of the 20th (Light) Division, was sent to the Western Front in France in June 1915. Before his departure, he married Elizabeth . The marital home was in Everton.

Jones was involved in the Battle of Loos in September–October 1915 and later served in the Ypres Salient in Belgium the following year. The 20th Division was among those tasked for the Battle of the Somme, and from 22 August 1916 it served in the Somme sector in France. On 3 September 1916, it was tasked with the capture of the village of Guillemont, which was strongly garrisoned by German forces. Jones was by now a sergeant. His platoon was part of a company ordered forward to strengthen the flank but it became cut off. Its commanding officer killed, for two days, under Jones&#x27;s command, the trapped platoon resisted German attempts to capture their position. Even when relieved by units of the 16th (Irish) Division, he remained in the line for several hours before withdrawing. For his actions, he was awarded the VC. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read as follows:

After some days&#x27; rest, the 20th Division was then involved in the next phase of fighting on the Somme, the Battle of Le Transloy. On the opening day of the battle, 7 October 1916, Jones was killed in action. His battalion had just reached and entered some German trenches. He is buried in Bancourt British Cemetery.

==Medals and legacy==
King George V presented Jones&#x27;s VC to his widow on 31 March 1917, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. It was owned for several years by his former employer, Blake&#x27;s Motor Company, which had been gifted it by Jones&#x27;s widow. It was loaned to the King&#x27;s Regimental Museum before it was donated in 2009 to the Museum of Liverpool, where it is displayed at its premises in Pierhead, Liverpool.

The year after his death, two separate plaques in his memory were constructed at his former school, Heyworth Street School. One was later moved to Everton Catholic Primary School while the other is in storage. Other memorials exist at St Nathaniel&#x27;s in Liverpool and Guillemont Church. The latter also commemorates John Holland and Thomas Hughes, two other VC recipients from the Battle of Guillemont.

<text>The BR Standard Class 6, otherwise known as the &quot;Clan&quot; Class, was a class of 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; tender steam locomotive designed by Robert Riddles for use by British Railways. Ten locomotives were constructed between 1951 and 1952, with a further 15 planned for construction. However, due to acute steel shortages in Britain, the order was continually postponed until it was finally cancelled on the publication of the 1955 Modernisation Plan for the re-equipment of British Railways. All of the original locomotives were scrapped, but a new one is being built. 

The &quot;Clan&quot; Class was based upon the BR Standard Class 7 &quot;Britannia&quot; Class design, incorporating a smaller boiler and various weight-saving measures to increase the route availability of a &quot;Pacific&quot;-type locomotive for its intended area of operations, the west of Scotland. The &quot;Clan&quot; Class received a mixed reception from crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving favourable reports as regards performance. However, trials in other areas of the British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive made it hard to adhere to timetables. Reports exist that suggest a degree of the disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they were only a Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.

Some of the &quot;Clan&quot; Class locomotives took their names from the Highland Railway Clan Class which was being withdrawn from service at the time, indicating further their intended area of operations. The class was ultimately deemed a failure by British Railways, and the last was withdrawn in 1966. None survived into preservation, although a project to build the next locomotive in line, number 72010 &quot;Hengist&quot;, is progressing. Assembly of the frames has commenced at CTL Seal, Sheffield.

==Background==
Under the initial scheme for the creation of a series of British Railways standard locomotives, larger passenger and mixed traffic types were intended to be of the 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; wheel arrangement, the main advantage of which was that it could be fitted with a wide firebox capable of burning a range of coal types (and qualities). The &quot;Pacifics&quot; were originally intended to be produced in four power groups: 8, 7, 6, and 5, according to the system of power ratings inherited from the LMS constituent company. Power groups 7, 6 &amp; 5 were to be for mixed traffic (MT) service. The whole standardisation programme was launched with the building of the 7MT Britannia design in 1951; in the event, the 5MT proposal was dropped in favour of an updated version of the highly successful Stanier mixed traffic 4-6-0.

It was further appreciated that a &quot;Pacific&quot; of 6MT power could be built with a high enough route availability to fulfil all remaining requirements; this had been amply demonstrated by Oliver Bulleid, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern Railway, who had developed a lighter version of his large 3-cylinder &quot;Merchant Navy&quot; Class in 1945. H.A.V. Bulleid, Oliver Bulleid&#x27;s son, advocated that the resultant &quot;Light Pacifics&quot; had &quot;almost 90%&quot; route availability on the Southern railway network.

The advantages of such a locomotive for use on some of the heavily restricted main lines in Scotland, such as the Dumfries to Stranraer line, had been further demonstrated by the remarkable performance of &quot;Light Pacific&quot; number 34004 &quot;Yeovil&quot; on the ex Highland Railway line to Inverness during the British Railways 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials. During these trials the locomotive showed that a &quot;Light Pacific&quot; had the potential to revolutionise the timetable over this difficult trunk route. As the general policy of the Railway Executive was to eliminate as far as possible the perceived complication of multi-cylinder locomotives, an equivalent 2-cylinder &quot;Pacific&quot; was produced by mounting a smaller and lighter boiler on the standard 7MT chassis.

==Design details==

The arrangement consisted of a modified Standard Class 7 boiler, with smaller steel cylinders and other modifications to save weight and hence increase route availability. The wider firebox, designed for use with cheaper imported coal, was also utilised to spread its weight evenly over the axles, whilst the standard smokebox completed the boiler, which at 225 lbf/in2 was rated at a lower working pressure than that of the &quot;Britannias&quot;. A single chimney was incorporated into the design, although this was to create problems later on, due to its small diameter, which reduced the choke area that allowed the fierce exhaust blast to escape, reducing the overall efficiency of the locomotive. Similarities with the &quot;Britannias&quot; rested with the frames, tenders and running gear, allowing easy standardisation of parts common with other classes. The design was fitted with a standard set of two Walschaerts valve gear systems, and all members of the class were equipped with 4,200 gallon BR 1 tenders.

Following experience of occasional cracks appearing in the frame plates near the spring brackets, had the second batch of Class 6 Standard Pacifics been built, the chassis would have been rearranged to be similar to that used on the solitary Class 8 Pacific. This would have resulted in the locomotive riding on three cast steel Combined Frame Stretcher &amp; Spring Brackets carrying the 10 front-most spring brackets and lengthened spring brackets behind the rear driven axle. These Combined Frame Stretcher &amp; Spring Brackets are often referred to as &quot;sub-frames&quot;. (Perhaps remarkably, the rearmost spring brackets were not to be integrated into a single cast combined sub-frame/pony truck pivot stretcher. The pony truck pivot stretcher being a separate fabrication).

Unlike the smaller BR Standards the exhaust steam manifold within the smokebox saddle (along with the BR Standard Class 7 engines) was a steel casting that was welded into the saddle. Other original drawings confirm the exhaust steam manifold was a steel fabrication in the smaller BR standards.

==Construction history==
Designed at the drawing offices of Derby Works, the new class was constructed at British Railways&#x27; Crewe Works between 1951 and 1952. The initial order was for 25 locomotives, but such was the immediacy of demand regarding a smaller version of the &quot;Britannias&quot; that a batch of 10 was rushed through construction before teething problems had been ironed out at the British Railways testing station at Rugby. No more were constructed due to the steel shortages of the 1950s, and onset of the British Railways Modernisation Plan from 1954.

===Initial modifications===
After initial running-in, E.S.Cox was quoted as discerning a distinct &quot;woolliness&quot; in their steaming, and although they missed their appointment at the Rugby Locomotive Testing Station due to late completion, some modifications were carried out, most notably to the diameter of the blastpipe, resulting in better steaming and increased power. Initially, the return cranks on the main driving wheels were of LNER block-type as seen on Arthur Peppercorn&#x27;s A1s and A2s, but this was changed to the simpler LMS four-stud fitting. With time, enough information was gathered from operational feedback from crews to allow modifications to be applied to the further 15 locomotives on order in the second batch, had they been built.

===Naming the locomotives===
The choice of locomotive names came from engineer and future railway historian Ernest Stewart Cox&#x27;s desire to replicate the extinct Ex-Highland Railway 4-6-0 &quot;Clan&quot; Class,(the last example being withdrawn in January 1950), thereby representing Scotland in the new organisation. The first of the class, No. 72000 &quot;Clan Buchanan&quot;, was treated to a special ceremony at Glasgow Central station on 15 January 1952 at which the Lord Provost unveiled its nameplates. Five of these names had previously been used on Highland Railway locomotives.
The first five of the planned second batch of 15 locomotives were intended for use on BR&#x27;s Southern Region; these were allocated names &quot;Hengist&quot;, &quot;Horsa&quot;, &quot;Canute&quot;, &quot;Wildfire&quot; and &quot;Firebrand&quot;, which had all been previously used on locomotives in southern England. The following ten were to be allocated to Scotland and were allocated further &quot;Clan&quot; names, all of which were new.

==Operational details==
The &quot;Clan Class&quot; had a mixed reception when first introduced to British Railways locomotive crews because there were only 10 locomotives in a class that was mostly confined to the North West of the railway network. This was due to the fact the low number of class members prevented effective training of locomotive crews throughout the nationalised network, and a degree of partisanship amongst crews towards newer locomotives further ensured this. The entire class was also based predominantly at two depots throughout their working lives, these being Glasgow Polmadie and Carlisle Kingmoor, compounding their restricted circulation. However, factors such as these meant that they spent most of their short careers out of the limelight that the &quot;Britannias&quot; had, resulting in a relatively camera shy class of locomotive. Crews that used them on regular duties displayed their liking for the locomotives, and as such, could produce good work. However, the predominant number of crews who were unfamiliar with the &quot;Clans&quot; found them difficult to handle, leading to an undeservedly bad reputation.

The poor steaming characteristics of the class had been the result of rushed production, which was another factor that led to the bad reputation of the &quot;Clan&quot; Class. Furthermore, they suffered from complaints regarding a lack of pulling power, although this can be attributed to indifferent handling and firing techniques, which certainly did not help the situation. However, had the Modernisation Plan been delayed, and the correct amount of investment made for undertaking the relevant modifications, such as streamlining of the steam passages and increased diameter blastpipe in a double-chimney layout, the &quot;Clans&quot; would have been free-steaming workhorses worthy of complementing the &quot;Britannias&quot;. Without modification, they were still capable machines when handled properly, as various feats testifying this included regular ascents of Shap and Beattock with 14 carriages without the assistance of a banking locomotive. Other arduous duties that the class frequently undertook were the regular turns on the Settle to Carlisle route, which has some of the steepest gradients and harshest working conditions of any British mainline. The Midland region was always short of top-link motive power and the &quot;Clan&quot; Class proved to be a very welcome addition to the fleet.

The engines also performed on Glasgow–Crewe, Manchester and Liverpool services, Edinburgh–Leeds services, Carlisle–Bradford services, and finally the Stranraer Boat Train workings. As more crews got used to them, the class could be found far from home territory at destinations as diverse as Aberdeen, Inverness, Port Talbot, Newcastle upon Tyne, Bristol, and even London. &quot;Clan&quot; number 72001 to this day remains the only Pacific locomotive to have worked over the West Highland Line, the result of a successful trial held in early 1956 to ascertain whether a Pacific type could traverse this steeply graded line. Having passed that test, a tribute to the versatility of the class, &quot;Clan Cameron&quot; was allowed to work special trains for the Clan Cameron gathering that took place in June of that year.

In August 1958, number 72009 was tested on the Eastern Region, being based at Stratford MPD, though a preference for the &quot;Britannias&quot; meant that this sojourn was short-lived, lasting only a month. The locomotive was utilised on services from London Liverpool Street to Norwich, Clacton, and Harwich. At first they were mistakenly allocated Class 7 duties, in which the &quot;Clans&quot;, although capable, were not able to keep to their allotted timings. This was part of the trials for the West Highland Line services mentioned earlier, but the locomotive was rejected for such duties on the grounds that they were &quot;no better than a good B1&quot;. The result of these trials was that as both Standard Class 7 and 8 locomotives were moved north in 1961 after dieselisation started in earnest, the &quot;Clans&quot; were downgraded to secondary work. Maintenance was initially undertaken at Crewe Works, but responsibility was transferred to Cowlairs Works in the spring of 1958. More varied work was allocated to them as their reliability improved, including working portions of the &quot;Thames-Clyde Express&quot; and the &quot;Queen of Scots Pullman&quot;. They also deputised for the many failed diesel locomotives that plagued the network at the time, and were extensively used on freight workings.

Most Scottish and Midland region crews that used them regularly took to the class, and found that if used properly, running times were kept with ease. These crews rated them the most sure-footed of any &quot;Pacifics&quot; available on the Midland Region, though other crews who tested them claimed that the &quot;Clans&quot; were prone to slipping, though this was the case with most &quot;Pacific&quot; designs. Despite the various successes of the &quot;Clans&quot;, the class was generally regarded as a failure, even with overall performance being just short of Riddles&#x27; aims. However, the premise of all British Railways Standard designs was for a hard working, easily maintained, economical, highly available, and all-purpose locomotive. In these respects, the &quot;Clans&quot; were highly successful.

===Proposed second batch and withdrawal===
Prior to the publishing of the Modernisation Plan advocating the change-over to diesel traction, there was a proposal to construct a second batch of the &quot;Clan&quot; Class, which was accepted as Crewe Works Order Lot 242. This authorised the construction of a further batch of fifteen &quot;Clans&quot; that included modifications to the original design. Originally scheduled for 1952 with frames constructed for 72010 &quot;Hengist&quot;, acute steel shortages meant that the order was continually rescheduled until the publication of the British Railways Modernisation Plan finally halted the project. The initial name allocations for the new batch would seem to suggest several operating the Kent coast trains, hauling the Golden Arrow and other expresses, so that some of this batch would have been allocated to the Southern Region.

The first locomotives to be withdrawn from service were the Polmadie locos 72000-72004 en masse in December 1962, where after being moved first to Glasgow Parkhead and stored, they were eventually moved to Darlington for scrapping in 1964. Of the Kingmoor allocation, the first, number 72005, was withdrawn in April 1965, whilst the final loco was 72008 on 21 May 1966 from Carlisle Kingmoor shed. When No 72008 &quot;Clan MacLeod&quot; was finally scrapped in August 1966, it rendered the class extinct. Though this locomotive served British Railways for only fourteen years and three months, it was the longest serving &quot;Clan&quot;.

==Livery and numbering==

The livery of the &quot;Clans&quot; was a continuation of the standard British Railways green applied to express passenger locomotives after nationalisation, lined in orange and black. The class was given the power classification 6P. Following on from the &quot;Britannias&quot;, the &quot;Clans&quot; were numbered under the British Railways standard numbering system in the 72xxx series. The locomotives were numbered between 72000 and 72009, and featured brass nameplates with a black background, located on the smoke deflectors, though towards the end of their working lives, some nameplates were painted with a red background.

==Preservation==

None of the original engines survived into preservation, however progress is being made by a Registered Charity (No. 1062320), the Standard Steam Locomotive Company, on constructing the engine that would have been the first of the uncompleted batch of 15, number 72010 &quot;Hengist&quot;. As 999 BR standard steam locomotives were built in the years up to 1960 the builders consider this is the 1000th locomotive build to be commenced to a British Railways standard design. The Standard Steam Locomotive Company believes that significant costs will be avoided as many of the required cast parts can be made from patterns held by fellow members of the British Railways Standard Locomotive Owners Group (BRSLOG).

<text>The Society for Technical Communication (STC) was a professional association dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of technical communication with more than 4,500 members in the United States, Canada, and the world. The society published a quarterly journal and a magazine eight times a year and hosted an annual international conference (STC Technical Communication Summit). STC also provided online education in the form of live Web seminars, multi-week online certificate courses, virtual conferences, recorded seminars, and more. The Society ceased operations on January 29, 2025.

==Overview==
Headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia, US, STC was the largest organization of its type in the world according to its website. It includes 50 chapters, 12 Special Interest Groups (SIGs), and over 4,500 members worldwide. STC members work in a wide range of roles, including:

*Technical writing
*Editing
*Consulting
*Content development
*Education 
*Environmental safety and health communication
*Graphic arts 
*Human factors 
*Indexing
*Information architecture
*Instructional design
*Management
*Photography
*Single source publishing
*Software development 
*Technical illustration
*Translation
*Usability 
*Visual design
*Web design

Most STC members belong to one or more &quot;communities,&quot; which are either geographic chapters or special interest groups (SIGs). Most chapters are in the United States, but STC includes members from 14 countries. The largest group outside the U.S. is the chapter in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

STC publishes a quarterly journal, &quot;Technical Communication&quot;, and a monthly magazine, &quot;Intercom&quot;.

== Certifications ==
STC offers certification as a &quot;Certified Professional Technical Communicator&quot; with three tiers: &quot;Foundation Level Certification (Level I)&quot;, &quot;Practitioner Level Certification (Level II)&quot; &quot;Expert Level Certification (Level III)&quot;. The certification is offered through APMG International and requires bi-annual renewal with 12 CEUs.

==History==
The organization traces its roots to the Society of Technical Writers (STW) in Boston and the Association of Technical Writers and Editors (ATWE) in New York. Both were founded in the United States in 1953. These organizations merged in 1957 to form the Society of Technical Writers and Editors (STWE). In 1960, this group merged with the Technical Publishing Society (TPS), based in Los Angeles, to become the Society of Technical Writers and Publishers. In 1971, the organization&#x27;s name was changed to the Society for Technical Communication.

The organization&#x27;s main journal developed from the &quot;TWE Journal&quot; to the &quot;STWE Review&quot; to the &quot;STWP Review&quot; to &quot;Technical Communications&quot; to &quot;Technical Communication&quot;. Editors of this journal have included Douglas E. Knight, Allan H. Lytel, A. Stanley Higgins, Frank R. Smith, George Hayhoe, and Menno de Jong.

Other important leaders in the history of STC include Robert T. Hamlett (first president of ATWE), A. E. Tyler (first president of TPS), Samuel A. Miles (president of the Society of Technical Writers and Editors, which became ATWE&#x27;s New York chapter in 1955), Vernon R. Root, Robert O. Shockney, and Stello Jordan. In 2011, Alan Houser was elected vice president of the organization; per their by-laws, he became president in 2012, and was succeeded by his own vice president Nicky Bleiel in 2013.

STC&#x27;s annual publications competition for 2012–2013 was held in Washington, D.C. The organization also has branches internationally. On November 12, 2012, STC&#x27;s branch in India held its 14th annual conference in Bangalore.

The Society ceased operations on January 29, 2025.

==Technical Communication Summit (Annual Conference)==
In May or June of each year, STC holds the Technical Communication Summit, the largest conference for technical communicators in the world. The Summit includes over 80 education session broken up into relevant subject areas or tracks; networking events such as the Opening General Session, Welcome Reception, Communities Reception, and Closing Lunch; an Honors Banquet; and an exhibit hall with dozens of companies offering technical communication products or services. The Summit also includes preconference education for an additional price.

==Other education==
In addition to the Technical Communication Summit, STC offers online education both to its members and nonmembers, with members receiving discounted registration rates. STC offers both live and recorded online education.

==STC Honors==
STC recognizes outstanding individuals by conferring the titles of Fellow, Associate Fellow, and Honorary Fellow. STC&#x27;s Honorary Fellow for 2009 was &quot;Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia.&quot;

STC also sponsors honorary societies for technical communication students with a grade point average of 3.5 or above: 
* Sigma Tau Chi recognizes students in four-year or graduate programs

<text>Thomas James Bede Kenny, VC (29 September 1896 – April 1953) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 20 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force during the First World War when for his conspicuous bravery he was awarded the VC.

==Early life==
Bede Kenny was born on 29 September 1896 at Paddington, Sydney, the son of Austin James Kenny, a butcher, from Auckland, New Zealand, and his wife Mary Christina, née Connolly, of New South Wales. He was educated at the Christian Brothers&#x27; College, Waverley.

Following matriculation from high school, he began to train as a chemist&#x27;s assistant at Bondi. After just three months of training, on 23 August 1915, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force — a fortnight after the major Australian actions at Lone Pine and The Nek.

==First World War==
On 20 December he embarked with the 13th Reinforcements, 2nd Battalion and, after arriving in Egypt, served with the 54th Battalion – the 2nd Battalion&#x27;s daughter battalion – before joining the 2nd on 27 February 1916. In March 1916 he went to France and, in the second phase of the Battle of Pozières, fought in the battalion bombing platoon.

On 9 April 1917, at Hermies, France, Kenny&#x27;s platoon was held up by an enemy strong point. Despite heavy enemy fire, he ran alone towards the enemy, killing one man who tried to stop him, and soon after bombing the enemy position. Kenny was successful in wounding and capturing the gun crew and seizing the gun. For his actions in Hermies he was awarded the Victoria Cross. His citation read:

Following this, Kenny was immediately promoted to lance corporal and soon afterwards was evacuated to England with trench-foot. He rejoined the battalion at Hazebrouck and on 26 June 1918 was wounded during fighting in the Merris sector. Despite describing his injuries as &quot;nothing to write home about&quot;, he was invalided to Australia in August, arriving in Sydney on 9 October. He had become a corporal earlier that same month. In Sydney, Kenny rejected an offer to join the military police, whom it is said he disliked intensely, and was subsequently discharged on 12 December.

==Civilian life==
Returning to civilian life in Australia, Kenny began working as a travelling salesman for Clifford Love &amp; Co. (manufacturers, importers and merchants). He then joined the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; newspaper in Sydney, and shortly after became a traveller for Penfolds Wines.

On 29 September 1927, Kenny married Kathleen Dorothy Buckley, a florist, at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral; they had four children. His eldest daughter died in 1943, and his only son in 1948, both from rheumatic fever, from which it is said he never recovered.

Kenny repeatedly suffered the effects of trench-foot; the war had also made him partially deaf. Though he never talked openly of his wartime experiences, Kenny always led the VC awardees in the Sydney Anzac Day march.

==Death and legacy==

Kenny died in Concord Repatriation General Hospital, Sydney, on 15 April 1953 and was buried in Botany cemetery. The pall bearers at his funeral were military policemen. He was survived by his wife and one of his daughters.

In 1957, the Bede Kenny Memorial Ward was opened at Wentworth Private Hospital, Randwick, to provide beds for ex-servicemen ineligible for repatriation hospital treatment.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial.

<text>The Gothia Cup () is an international youth association football tournament organized by professional football club BK Häcken, which has been held annually since 1975 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Considered the biggest tournament in the world in terms of participating teams, competing youth teams throughout the world enter the competition. The Gothia Cup is also Sweden&#x27;s largest annual event. The Jamie Johnson (TV series) in Series 4 displays Phoenix FC, a grassroots football club competing in the Gothia Cup.

==Overview==
Spanning one week the Gothia Cup is a youth association football tournament held annually in Gothenburg, Sweden, open for both boys and girls of ages 11 to 18.

<doc id="1223006" wikidata="Q5539435" url="?curid=1223006" title="George Fraser Kerr">
<text>George Fraser Kerr VC, MC &amp; Bar, MM, (8 June 1895 – 8 December 1929) was a soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces, during the First World War. He had been awarded the Military Medal and the Military Cross (and bar) for actions earlier in the war.

==Early life==
George Fraser Kerr was born on 8 June 1895 in Deseronto in Ontario, to John Kerr, a storekeeper, and Isabell (). The family moved to Toronto when Kerr was eight years old. After completing his education, he began working at a bank.

==First World War==
In September 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, Kerr enlisted in the 3rd (Toronto) Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). He embarked for Britain the next month and, with his battalion part of 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division, arrived in France on the Western Front in February 1915 after a period of training. By this stage, he had been promoted to corporal.

Kerr served in the Ypres sector with his battalion for much of 1916, and in June, was awarded the Military Medal (MM) for his actions during the Battle of Mont Sorrel. He was wounded the next month and the severity of his injuries warranted him being sent to England for medical treatment. He did not return to his unit for several months but when he did, it was as a lieutenant; he had been commissioned while serving with a reserve battalion back in England.

On 8 August 1918, the opening day of the Battle of Amiens, Kerr led a platoon of infantry in closing a gap in the Allied line and captured a battery of field guns. Advancing further forward, he and his men destroyed several machine-gun posts before reaching their objective for the day. Wounded, he remained with his platoon for two days before seeking medical treatment. He was later awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his endeavours. Learning of the forthcoming offensive on the Drocourt-Quéant Line, for which his battalion was scheduled to participate on 2 September 1918, he discharged himself from medical care and re-joined his platoon. He was again instrumental in attack, and his leadership was recognised with an award of a bar to his MC.

On 27 September 1918, Kerr was commanding a support company at Bourlon Wood, during the Battle of the Canal du Nord (a part of Canada&#x27;s Hundred Days). The advance of the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 1st Brigade was affected by heavy machine-gun fire from a nearby railway embankment. Under his command, Kerr&#x27;s company dealt with the holdup. He later made a solo foray, ahead of his company, during which four machine-guns were destroyed and 31 prisoners taken. For this, Kerr was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions. The citation for his VC read:

Kerr&#x27;s VC was gazetted on 4 January 1919, which was a month after his MC was announced in the London Gazette. The bar to his MC was gazetted on 1 February 1919. He was presented with his VC, as well as his MC and bar, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 20 May 1919.

==Later life==
After being discharged from the CEF in July 1919, Kerr returned to Toronto and began working for a company supplying metals. He was involved in the local militia, serving in the Toronto Regiment in which he was a captain. He died on 8 December 1929 at his home in Toronto of carbon monoxide poisoning. Survived by his wife and daughter, he was buried at Toronto&#x27;s Mount Pleasant Cemetery with military honours.

==Medals and legacy==
Kerr&#x27;s VC is displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, along with his MM, MC and bar, and his campaign medals: the British War Medal, and Victory Medal. There are at least two memorials in his memory; a plaque in Valour Place, Cambridge, in Ontario, and one erected by the Royal Canadian Legion at Centennial Park, in his hometome of Deseronto.

<doc id="1223007" wikidata="Q741648" url="?curid=1223007" title="Carlos Gutierrez">
<text>Carlos Miguel Gutierrez (originally Gutiérrez; born November 4, 1953) is an American former CEO and former United States Secretary of Commerce. He is currently a co-founder and executive chairman of EmPath. Gutierrez is a former chairman of the board and CEO of the Kellogg Company. He served as the 35th U.S. Secretary of Commerce from 2005 to 2009.

==Early life and education==
Gutierrez is of Spanish descent. He was born in Havana, Cuba, the son of a pineapple plantation owner. As a successful businessman, his father was deemed an enemy of the state by Fidel Castro&#x27;s regime. Faced with the expropriation of their property following the Cuban Revolution, Gutierrez&#x27;s family fled for the United States in 1960, when he was six years old, settling in Miami.

When it became apparent they would not be returning to Cuba, Gutierrez&#x27;s father accepted a position with the H. J. Heinz Company in Mexico and later started his own business. Gutierrez learned his first words of English from the bellhop at the hotel where they initially stayed and, some years later, he and his family acquired United States citizenship.

Gutierrez studied business administration at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education campus in Querétaro but never received a degree, making him the most recent U.S. Cabinet member without a college degree.

==Kellogg Company==
Gutierrez joined Kellogg&#x27;s in Mexico in 1975, at the age of 22, as a sales representative and management trainee. One of his early assignments was driving a delivery-truck route around local stores.

Gutierrez rose through the management ranks. In January 1990 he was promoted to corporate vice president of product development at the company&#x27;s headquarters in Battle Creek, Michigan, and in July of that year, he became executive vice president of Kellogg USA. In January 1999, he was elected to the company&#x27;s board of directors. In April he was appointed president and CEO, succeeding Arnold G. Langbo, becoming the only Latino CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Gutierrez was also the youngest CEO in the company&#x27;s nearly 100-year history.

In 1999, Kellogg faced a global decline or stagnation in cereal sales. Gutierrez&#x27;s strategy, known as &quot;Volume to Value,&quot; was to increase sales by focusing resources on higher-margin products. Higher-margin products targeted specific markets and included products such as Special K, Kashi, and Nutri-Grain bars. Extra income would fund advertising, promotions, and R&amp;D, which would encourage further high-margin sales growth. &quot;Volume is a means to an end--not an end,&quot; he said. &quot;What counts is dollars.&quot;

In September 2004, Fortune Magazine dubbed Gutierrez as &quot;The Man Who Fixed Kellogg&quot;, and attributed his success to &quot;taking the slick salesmanship, financial discipline, and marketing savvy that he learned in his youth and blending it with disarming charisma, steely resolve, and an utter lack of pretension that you wouldn&#x27;t expect in one so nattily dressed.&quot; The magazine also added that, &quot;He even makes golf shirts look debonair.&quot;

==Secretary of Commerce==
On November 29, 2004, Gutierrez was chosen by President George W. Bush to become Secretary of Commerce, succeeding Donald Evans. On the same day, Kellogg&#x27;s board of directors accepted Gutierrez&#x27;s resignation as chairman of the board and CEO, to be effective upon his confirmation by the Senate and swearing-in. On January 24, 2005, Gutierrez was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate; he was sworn in on February 7, 2005.

As Secretary of Commerce, Gutierrez also served as co-chair of the U.S. Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba. Secretary Gutierrez was actively involved in U.S.-Cuba policy alongside Co-Chair Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Gutierrez was also one of the President&#x27;s point men working with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation, an issue he sees as one of the greatest domestic social issues of our time. He believes a successful immigration solution must focus first on securing our borders, but must also address immigrants&#x27; contribution to our economy and the importance of American unity.

Gutierrez played a key role in the passage of CAFTA-DR, a landmark trade agreement that expanded opportunities for U.S. exports throughout Latin America. Gutierrez was also instrumental in promoting the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. In 2006 Gutierrez called for Congress to “work with us and pass the pending Free Trade Agreements with Colombia, Korea and Panama, so we can have fair, two-way trade with our allies and friends.” He also led the first-ever domestic trade mission to the Gulf region in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

In December 2007, Ken Silverstein, the Washington editor of Harper&#x27;s Magazine, reported that Gutierrez had Adnan Oktar&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of Creation&quot;, a book that advocates Islamic creationism and blames Charles Darwin for modern terrorism, including the 9/11 attacks, for display on a stand at the entrance to his U.S. government office. Gutierrez&#x27;s office did not respond when asked whether the book had been purchased or mailed unsolicited to his office.

==Post-Bush administration==
Gutierrez was the founder and chairman of &quot;Global Political Strategies&quot;, an international strategic consulting service and a division of APCO Worldwide, a Washington-based global communications firm.

In February 2009, Gutierrez was named a Scholar at the University of Miami’s Institute For Cuban And Cuban American Studies. In April 2009, he joined the university&#x27;s board of trustees. He is also Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Meridian International Center, as well as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Bipartisan Debt Reduction Task Force.

On February 21, 2009, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Gutierrez remained unemployed, along with a significant majority of George W. Bush&#x27;s 3,000 political appointees who were seeking full-time employment. According to the article, 25% to 30% of those officials had found new jobs, a statistic notably lower than when Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton left the White House. The article notes that &quot;at least half those presidents&#x27; senior staffers landed employment within a month after the administration ended.&quot; Gutierrez commented that, &quot;This is not a great time for anyone to be job hunting, including numerous former political appointees.&quot; He added that he hopes to run a company like Kellogg again because &quot;I have a lot of energy.&quot; However, according to a press release from United Technologies Corporation, Gutierrez joined the company&#x27;s board of directors on February 9, several days prior to the publication of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article.

According to press releases, Gutierrez also serves on the Board of Directors of Occidental Petroleum, GLW Corning, and Intelligent Global Pooling Systems. He is also a television news contributor for the business news television channel CNBC. In March 2010, Gutierrez said he would not like to return to a CEO spot at a foodmaker, because as commerce secretary, he had something different to do each day, whereas, &quot;Business is pretty one-dimensional.&quot;

In December 2010, Gutierrez became a vice chairman of Citigroup in the Institutional Clients Group and member of the Senior Strategic Advisory Group. He left the company in February 2013

Gutierrez served as a member of the Debt Reduction Task Force at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

In 2012 Gutierrez lead the creation of the SuperPAC Republicans for Immigration Reform; he said he believed that &quot;the far right of this party has taken the party to a place that it doesn&#x27;t belong&quot;.

In 2013, Gutierrez was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case. On October of that same year, Time Warner elected him to its board of directors.

In August 2016, Gutierrez endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, stating that Donald Trump&#x27;s economic policies were a &quot;disaster&quot;. In 2020, he endorsed Joe Biden for president.

==Personal life==
Gutierrez and his wife Edilia have one son, Carlos Jr., and two daughters, Erika and Karina.

<text>Surgeon General William George Nicholas Manley, (17 December 1831 – 16 November 1901) was a British Army officer, surgeon and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He received awards from several other countries, and is the only person to have been awarded both the VC and the Iron Cross.

==Early life==
Manley was born in Dublin, Ireland, on 17 December 1831, the second son of the Reverend William Nicholas Manley, his mother being a daughter of Dr. Brown of the Army Medical Staff. He was educated at the Blackheath Proprietary School and became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1851.

==Military career==
In 1854 Manley joined the army medical staff, and was attached to the Royal Regiment of Artillery serving in Crimea. He was present for the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War. He was later posted with his regiment in New Zealand.

===Victoria Cross===
Manley was 32 years old, and an assistant surgeon in the Royal Regiment of Artillery during the Waikato-Hauhau Maori War, New Zealand when the following deed took place on 29 April 1864 near Tauranga, New Zealand, during the assault on the rebel pā (&quot;pah&quot;) Gate Pā, for which he was awarded the VC.
He also served in the same war under Sir Trevor Chute, and was present at the assault and capture of the Okotukou, Putahi, Otapawe, and Waikohou Pahs. For his services on these occasions he was again mentioned in dispatches and promoted to staff surgeon.

===Later career===
When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870 he proceeded with the British Ambulance Corps, and was attached to the 22nd division of the Prussian Army. He was present for several battles, and received several decorations including the Iron Cross (second class) on the recommendation of the German Crown Prince:
In 1878–79 he served with the Quetta Field force in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, and in 1882 he was in Egypt for the Anglo-Egyptian War as Principal Medical officer of the Second Division under Sir Edward Hamley and was present at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir. After this war he was promoted to Deputy Surgeon-General.

==Later life==
Manley was awarded the honorary rank of surgeon general and retired from the army in 1884 with a distinguished service pension. Upon retirement he was made a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John of Jerusalem and a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He died in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, on 16 November 1901.

==Family==
Manley married Miss M. E. Darton, daughter of Thomas Hartwood Darton, of Temple Dinsley, Hertfordshire. They had one daughter and five sons, including Lieutenant G. E. D. Manley, who died while on service in China shortly before his father&#x27;s death in 1901.

==Honours and awards==
Manley was awarded 18 medals by several countries, and was the only recipient of both the VC and the Iron Cross, the highest medals of the United Kingdom and Prussia (later part of the German Empire).

Among his awards were:

During his time in New Zealand he also received the bronze medal of the Royal Humane Society for rescuing a man from drowning, and after the siege of Paris he received the Cross of the &quot;Société française de secours aux blessés militaires&quot;.
His medals are on display in the medals gallery of Firepower - The Royal Artillery Museum in Woolwich, south east London.

<doc id="1223018" wikidata="Q282475" url="?curid=1223018" title="Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti">
<text>The Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti () was created in 1762 by the unification of the two eastern Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti. From the early 16th century, according to the 1555 Peace of Amasya, these two kingdoms were under Iranian control. In 1744, Nader Shah granted the kingship of Kartli to Teimuraz II and that of Kakheti to his son Heraclius II, as a reward for their loyalty. When Nader Shah died in 1747, Teimuraz II and Heraclius II capitalized on the instability in Iran proper, and declared &quot;de facto&quot; independence. After Teimuraz II died in 1762, Heraclius succeeded him as ruler of Kartli, thus unifying the two kingdoms.

Heraclius was able, after centuries of Iranian suzerainty over Georgia, to guarantee the autonomy of his kingdom throughout the chaos that had erupted following Nader Shah&#x27;s death. He became the new Georgian king of a politically united eastern Georgia for the first time in three centuries. Though Heraclius tendered his &quot;de jure&quot; submission to the newly established Zand dynasty quickly after the unification in 1762, the kingdom remained &quot;de facto&quot; autonomous for the next three decades to come. In 1783, Heraclius signed the Treaty of Georgievsk with the Russian Empire, by which he formally laid Kartli-Kakheti&#x27;s investiture in the hands of the Russian monarch, and made the kingdom a Russian protectorate. Amongst others, this provided the nominal guarantee for protection against new Iranian attempts, or by any others, to (re)conquer or attack eastern Georgia. By the 1790s, a new strong Iranian dynasty, the Qajar dynasty, had emerged under Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, which would prove pivotal in the history of the short-lived kingdom.

In the next few years, having secured mainland Iran, the new Iranian king set out to reconquer the Caucasus and to re-impose its traditional suzerainty over the region. After Heraclius II refused to denounce the treaty with Russia and to voluntarily reaccept Iran&#x27;s suzerainty in return for peace and prosperity for his kingdom, Agha Mohammad Khan invaded Kartli-Kakheti, captured and sacked Tbilisi, effectively bringing it back under Iranian control. This was short-lived, however, for Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated two years later. Heraclius II himself died a year after that.

The following years, which were spent in confusion, culminated in 1801 with the official annexation of the kingdom by Paul I within the Russian Empire during the nominal ascension of Heraclius&#x27;s son George XII to the Kartli-Kakhetian throne. Following the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813, Iran officially ceded the kingdom to Russia, marking the start of a Russian-centred chapter in Georgian history.

==History==

After Nader Shah&#x27;s death in 1747, Heraclius II and Teimuraz II capitalized on the eruption of chaos in mainland Iran. In the ensuing period Heraclius II made alliances with the khans of the area, established a leading position in the southern Caucasus, and requested Russian aid. In 1762, he succeeded his father as king of Kartli, and with already being king of Kakheti, eastern Georgia thus became politically unified for the first time in three centuries. Around 1760, it had become evident as well that Karim Khan Zand had become the new ruler of Iran. Shortly after, in 1762–1763, during Karim Khan&#x27;s campaigns in Azerbaijan, Heraclius II tendered his &quot;de jure&quot; submission to him and received his investiture as &quot;vali&quot; (&quot;governor&quot;, &quot;viceroy&quot;) of &quot;Gorjestan&quot; (Georgia), the traditional Safavid office, which by this time however had become an &quot;empty honorific&quot;. Karim Khan died in 1779 however, with Persia again being engulfed into chaos.
Seeking to remain independent, but also realizing that he would need a foreign protector with regard to his kingdom&#x27;s foreign policy, King Heraclius II concluded the Treaty of Georgievsk with Russia in 1783, resulting in the transfer of responsibility for defense and foreign affairs in the eastern kingdom, as well as importantly, officially abjuring any dependence on Iran or any other power. However, despite these large concessions made to Russia, Heraclius II was successful in retaining internal autonomy in his kingdom.

Heraclius II&#x27;s &quot;curiously ambivalent position&quot; in these decades is reflected in the coins issued by him in his realm. Silver coins were struck with the name of Ismail III on it, or with the Zand-style inscription &quot;ya karim&quot; (&quot;O Gracious One&quot;), whereby an epithet to God was invoked, which actually referred to Karim Khan Zand. These coins were minted in Tbilisi up until 1799 – some twenty years after Karim Khan Zand&#x27;s death. In the same decades, the copper coins struck at Tbilisi bore three types of iconography; Christian, Georgian, &quot;and even&quot; Imperial Russian (such as the double-headed eagle). By minting the silver coins with a reference to Karim Khan Zand on it they were usable for trade in Iran, whereas the copper coins, struck for only local use, reflected Heraclius II&#x27;s political orientation towards Russia.

===Court and reign===
While Heraclius II&#x27;s court maintained a certain Persian-type pomp, and he himself dressed in the Persian style as well, he launched an ambitious program of &quot;Europeanization&quot; which was supported by the Georgian intellectual élites; it was not overwhelmingly successful however, because Georgia remained physically isolated from Europe and had to expend all available resources on defending its precarious independence. He strove to enlist the support of European powers, and to attract Western scientists and technicians to give his country the benefit of the latest military and industrial techniques. His style of governing resembled that of contemporary enlightened despots in Central Europe. He exercised executive, legislative, and judicial authority and closely supervised the activities of government departments. Heraclius&#x27;s primary objective in internal policy was to further centralize the government through reducing the powers of the aristocracy. For this purpose, he attempted to create a governing élite composed of his own agents to replace the self-minded aristocratic lords in local affairs.

==Qajar invasion==

In the last few decades of the 18th century, Georgia had become a more important element in Russo-Iranian relations than some provinces in northern mainland Iran, such as Mazandaran or even Gilan. Unlike Peter I, Catherine, the then ruling monarch of Russia, viewed Georgia as a pivot for her Caucasian policy, as Russia&#x27;s new aspirations were to use it as a base of operations against both Iran and the Ottoman Empire, both immediate bordering geo-political rivals of Russia. On top of that, having another port on the Georgian coast of the Black Sea would be ideal. A limited Russian contingent of two infantry battalions with four artillery pieces arrived in Tbilisi in 1784, but was withdrawn, despite the frantic protests of the Georgians, in 1787 as a new war against Ottoman Turkey had started on a different front.

The consequences of these events came a few years later, when a new dynasty, the Qajars, emerged victorious in the protracted power struggle in Iran. Qajar shah, Agha Mohammad Khan, as his first objective, resolved to bring the Caucasus again fully under the Iranian orbit.
For Agha Mohammad Khan, the re-subjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. He viewed Georgia, like the Safavids and Nader Shah before him, no different from the provinces in mainland Iran, such as Khorasan. As the &quot;Cambridge History of Iran&quot; states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah&#x27;s death and the collapse of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part of the &quot;vali&quot; of Georgia.

Finding an interval of peace amid their own quarrels and with northern, western, and central Persia secure, the Iranians demanded Heraclius II to renounce the treaty with Russia and to re-accept Persian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran&#x27;s neighboring rival, recognized the latter&#x27;s rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries. Heraclius appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, asking for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was ignored, leaving Georgia to fend off the Iranian threat alone. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the shah&#x27;s ultimatum.

Agha Mohammad Khan subsequently crossed the Aras River, and after a turn of events by which he gathered more support from his subordinate khans of Erivan and Ganja, he sent Heraclius a last ultimatum, which he also declined, but, sent couriers to St. Petersburg. Gudovich, who sat in Georgievsk at the time, instructed Heraclius to avoid &quot;expense and fuss&quot;, while Heraclius, together with Solomon II and some Imeretians headed southwards of Tbilisi to fend off the Iranians.

With half the number of troops Agha Mohammad Khan had crossed the Aras river, he now marched directly upon Tbilisi, where it commenced into a huge battle between the Iranian and Georgian armies. Heraclius had managed to mobilize some 5,000 troops, including some 2,000 from neighboring Imereti under its King Solomon II. The Georgians, hopelessly outnumbered, were eventually defeated despite stiff resistance. In a few hours, the Iranian king Agha Mohammad Khan was in full control of the Georgian capital. The Persian army marched back laden with spoil and carrying off thousands of captives.

By this, after the conquest of Tbilisi and being in effective control of eastern Georgia, Agha Mohammad was formally crowned Shah in 1796 in the Mughan plain. As the &quot;Cambridge History of Iran&quot; notes; &quot;Russia&#x27;s client, Georgia, had been punished, and Russia&#x27;s prestige, damaged.&quot; Heraclius II returned to Tbilisi to rebuild the city, but the destruction of his capital was a death blow to his hopes and projects. Upon learning of the fall of Tbilisi General Gudovich put the blame on the Georgians themselves. To restore Russian prestige, Catherine II declared war on Persia, upon the proposal of Gudovich, and sent an army under Valerian Zubov to the Qajar possessions on April of that year, but the new Tsar Paul I, who succeeded Catherine in November, shortly recalled it.

==Aftermath and absorption into the Russian Empire==
Reestablishment of Iranian rule over Georgia was short-lived this time, and the next few years were years of muddling and confusion. In 1797, Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated in his tent in Shusha, the capital of the Karabakh khanate, which he had taken just some days earlier. On January 14, 1798, as King Heraclius II died, and he was succeeded on the throne by his eldest son, George XII (1746–1800) who, on February 22, 1799, recognized his own eldest son, the Tsarevich David (&quot;Davit Bagrationi-batonishvili&quot;), 1767–1819, as official heir apparent. In the same year, following the power vacuum in Georgia that got created mainly due to Agha Mohammad Khan&#x27;s death, the Russian troops entered Tbilisi. Pursuant to article VI of the 1783 treaty, Emperor Paul confirmed David&#x27;s claim to reign as the next king on April 18, 1799. But strife broke out among King George&#x27;s many sons and those of his late father over the throne, Heraclius II having changed the succession order at the behest of his third wife, Queen Darejan (Darya), to favor the accession of younger brothers of deceased kings over their own sons.

The resulting dynastic upheaval prompted King George to secretly invite Paul I of Russia to invade Kartli-Kakheti, subdue the Bagrationi princes, and govern the kingdom from St. Petersburg, on the condition that George and his descendants be allowed to continue to reign nominally – in effect, offering to mediatise the Bagrationi dynasty under the Romanov emperors. Continued pressure from Persia, also prompted George XII&#x27;s request for Russian intervention.

Paul tentatively accepted this offer, but before negotiations could be finalized, he changed his mind and issued a decree on December 18, 1800 annexing Kartli-Kakheti to Russia and deposing the Bagratids. Paul himself was assassinated shortly thereafter. It is said that his successor, Emperor Alexander I, considered retracting the annexation in favor of a Bagratid heir, but being unable to identify one likely to retain the crown, on September 12, 1801, Alexander proceeded to confirm annexation. Meanwhile, King George had died on December 28, 1800, before learning that he had lost his throne. By the following April, Russian troops took control of the country&#x27;s administration and in February 1803 Tsarevich David Bagrationi was escorted by Russian troops from Tbilisi to St. Petersburg.

As it was impossible for Iran to give up Georgia, which had made part of the concept of Iran for centuries like the rest of its Caucasian territories, the annexation of Kartli-Kakheti led directly to the Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century, namely that of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828. During the 1804–1813 war, the Russians scored a crucial victory over the Iranian army at the Zagam river saving Tbilisi from Iranian reconquest. The war eventually ended with the Treaty of Gulistan, which forced Iran to officially cede eastern Georgia, Dagestan, as well as most of the modern-day Azerbaijan Republic to Russia. By the 1826-28 war, Russia took modern-day Armenia, the Nakhichevan Khanate, the Lankaran Khanate and Iğdır from Iran. Thus, by 1828, the Russians had gained an immensely strong foothold in the Caucasus. Parts of western Georgia were added to the empire during the same period through wars with the Ottoman Empire.

<text>In the history of cryptography, M-325, also known as SIGFOY, was an American rotor machine designed by William F. Friedman and built in 1944. Between 1944 and 1946, more than 1,100 machines were deployed within the United States Foreign Service. Its use was discontinued in 1946 because of faults in operation. Friedman applied for a patent on the M-325 on 11 August 1944; it was and was granted on 17 March 1959 (US patent #2,877,565).

Like the Enigma, the M-325 contains three intermediate rotors and a reflecting rotor.

<doc id="1223023" wikidata="Q5126611" url="?curid=1223023" title="Clarence Jeffries">
<text>Clarence Smith Jeffries, VC (26 October 1894 – 12 October 1917) was an Australian mining surveyor, soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross following his actions in the First Battle of Passchendaele during the First World War, in which he led several parties of men in an attack that led to the capture of six machine guns and sixty-five prisoners, before being killed himself by machine gun fire.

Born in a suburb of Newcastle, New South Wales, Jeffries was employed as a surveyor at a mining company where his father served as general manager. Joining a militia battalion in 1912, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant upon the outbreak of war and tasked with the instruction of volunteers for the newly raised Australian Imperial Force. Transferring into the Australian Imperial Force himself in 1916, Jeffries embarked with the 34th Battalion for service on the Western Front. Wounded at Messines, he was promoted to captain before being killed fourteen days short of his twenty-third birthday.

==Early life==
Jeffries was born in the Newcastle suburb of Wallsend, New South Wales, on 26 October 1894. He was the only child of Joshua Jeffries, a colliery manager, and his wife Barbara, née Steel. Jeffries attended Dudley Primary School before moving onto Newcastle Collegiate and High schools. Apprenticed as a mining surveyor at the Abermain Collieries on the state&#x27;s northern coalfields, where his father was general manager, Jeffries was noted as a cricketer and a keen horseman who took a particular interest in breeding thoroughbreds. In July 1912, Jeffries joined the 14th (Hunter River) Infantry Regiment, Citizens Military Force, as a private under the compulsory training scheme. He was promoted to sergeant a year later.

==First World War==
Following the outbreak of the First World War, Jeffries was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force on 22 August 1914. By this time he was in charge of the survey department at the Abermain Collieries, but was mobilised for home defence duties and the instruction of volunteers for the newly raised Australian Imperial Force at Newcastle and Liverpool camps. Promoted lieutenant in the Citizens Military Force in July 1915, he transferred to the Australian Imperial Force on 1 February 1916 with the substantive rank of second lieutenant, and was placed in command of C Company of the 34th Battalion. In May, the battalion embarked from Sydney for the United Kingdom, with Jeffries aboard HMAT &quot;Hororata&quot;. Arriving in late June, the battalion spent the next five months training in England, during which time Jeffries was promoted to lieutenant.

In late November 1916, the 34th Battalion was shipped to France for service on the Western Front. Initially posted to the Armentières sector in Belgium, the battalion did not participate in its first major battle until June 1917, when it took part in the Battle of Messines after the British and Dominion operations switched to the Ypres sector of Belgium. During the engagement, Jeffries received a bullet wound to the thigh while leading a reconnaissance patrol and was evacuated to the 3rd General Hospital in London. While recuperating, he was promoted to captain on 26 June, before rejoining his battalion in September as a company commander.

===Victoria Cross===

On 12 October 1917, the 34th Battalion—as a member of the 9th Brigade—was to take part in the 3rd Australian Division&#x27;s attack on Passchendaele, Belgium. Subject to several days of heavy rain, the battlefield had been transformed into a boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence. Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack, which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting, as many of the direction tapes leading to the starting position had been destroyed or swallowed up by the mud. To avoid any mishaps, Jeffries and another of the battalion&#x27;s company commanders, Captain T.G. Gilder, pushed on alone as far as Keerselaarhoek cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack. Thus, by 03:00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack.

At the designated time of 05:25, the British opened up with an artillery barrage on the German positions just as the Australian forces entered no man&#x27;s land for the attack. Heavy machine gun fire assaulted the troops from all directions as they bunched together on the firmer ground to avoid sinking in the boggy mud. Serious resistance was encountered at Hilside Farm, a strong point to the east of Augustus Wood in the centre of the highest part of the Passchendaele ridge. The position consisted of two pillboxes, supported by fifty metres of trench that was occupied by approximately thirty men with four machine guns. The fire from these machine guns forced the men of the 34th Battalion to seek cover on the exposed crest and threatened to halt the entire advance.

Jeffries, realising his force was suffering heavy casualties, quickly organised a bombing party of fourteen men and set about outflanking the pillboxes. Accompanying Jeffries was Sergeant James Bruce, a 39-year-old Scottish-born miner who had worked for Jeffries&#x27; father at the Abermain Collieries. According to popular legend, Bruce had promised to look out for his boss&#x27;s son, and remained at Jeffries&#x27; side throughout the attack. Working around the position, the party attacked the emplacement from the rear, capturing four machine guns and thirty-five prisoners; thus reviving the advance. Jeffries then led his company forward under heavy artillery and machine gun fire to reach their first objective.

Despite the heavy losses which left gaping holes in the Allied line, it was decided that the next stage of the advance was to go ahead. At 08:25, parties from the 34th and 35th Battalions headed out along the south-eastern edge of the ridge towards the outskirts of Passchendaele. Almost immediately, they came under heavy fire from a pillbox close by a railway embankment, at which time Major J.B. Buchanan, the senior brigade officer with the advance party, fell dead, leaving Jeffries to assume control. Gathering a party of eleven men, he set about silencing the machine gun position. Edging across the open ground, the party attacked the position from the west just as the machine gun was firing to the north. Realising that an attack was imminent, the machine gunner switched around, mortally wounding Jeffries in the stomach and sending the rest of the party to ground. When its fire eased, the remaining members of the group worked around the position, rushed it and seized two machine guns in conjunction with thirty prisoners.

With the second objective only partially captured, the remnants of the 9th Brigade, battered by artillery and machine gun fire, were forced to relinquish their position and retreat back to their own lines. All that remained on the Passchendaele ridge of the 9th Brigade was the dead and wounded, among whom was Clarence Jeffries, who was later counted among those with no known grave.

==Legacy==

For his actions during the battle at Passchendaele, Jeffries was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the notification of which was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 18 December 1917. His citation read:


Severely affected by the unknown fate of his son&#x27;s body, Joshua Jeffries set out for Belgium in 1920 in an attempt to discover his son&#x27;s &quot;lost grave&quot;. He returned to Australia disappointed, only to learn in January 1921 that Clarence&#x27;s body had been exhumed from a battlefield grave on 14 September 1920, and re-buried in Tyne Cot Cemetery, Plot XL, Row E, Grave 1. The body had been identified by a set of captain&#x27;s pips, Australian numerals and the penciled initials &quot;C.S.J.&quot; found on the ground sheet in which the body was wrapped. Three years later, Joshua Jeffries returned to Belgium once again; this time to pay his last respects to his son. As a debt of gratitude to the late Lieutenant James Bruce, MC, DCM, who as a sergeant had assisted Clarence at Passchendaele before being killed himself on 17 July 1918, Joshua employed Bruce&#x27;s two eldest sons as trainee mining surveyors at the Abermain Collieries.

Following a campaign by the citizens of Abermain, the Capt. Clarence Smith Jeffries Memorial Park was established in 1947, and upon Barbara Jeffries death in 1964, she bequeathed her son&#x27;s medals to the Warriors Chapel at Christchurch Cathedral, Newcastle, New South Wales where they are currently on display. 

Jeffries is also commemorated by photographic portraits in the Abermain Memorial and Citizens&#x27; Club and by a carved chair presented to Abermain Holy Trinity Anglican Church by his uncle and aunt in 1918. In 1976, the Jeffries and Currey Memorial Library was opened by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler, at Dudley Public School to honour two of the school&#x27;s pupils who were decorated with the Victoria Cross during the First World War: Clarence Jeffries and William Currey. The pair are also commemorated by the Capt. Clarence Smith Jeffries (V.C.) and Pte. William Matthew Currey (V.C.) Memorial Wall located in the grounds of Sandgate General Cemetery, Newcastle, which was unveiled in an official ceremony on 16 April 2000. The Clarence Jeffries Housing Estate at Bullecourt Army Barracks in Adamstown is also named in his honour.

<text>Leslie Thomas Manser, VC (11 May 1922 – 31 May 1942) was a British bomber pilot and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, which was awarded posthumously following an attack on the German city of Cologne.

==Early life==
Leslie Thomas Manser was born in New Delhi, India, during his father&#x27;s employment as an engineer with the Post and Telegraph Department and, when the family returned to Britain, they settled in Radlett, Hertfordshire. He was a pupil of Victoria Boys&#x27; School, Kurseong, Darjeeling and Aldenham School, Elstree, Hertfordshire.

==Royal Air Force==
Manser was accepted by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in August 1940, and was commissioned as a pilot officer in May 1941. After a navigational course and final operational training at No. 14 Operational Training Unit, RAF Cottesmore, he was posted to No. 50 Squadron operating the Handley Page Hampden at RAF Swinderby, Lincolnshire, on 27 August.

Two days after joining his squadron, Manser experienced his first operation: as a second pilot, he took part in a bombing raid on Frankfurt. During the next two months he flew six more sorties against targets including Berlin, Hamburg and Karlsruhe, before being posted to No. 25 Operational Training Unit, Finningley on 7 November and a month later posted back to No. 14 Operational Training Unit as an instructor.

Manser served briefly with No. 420 Squadron RCAF (Hampdens) from March to April 1942 when he rejoined No. 50 Squadron then operating from RAF Skellingthorpe, and converted to the new Avro Manchester medium bomber. He piloted one of the new aircraft during a leaflet drop over Paris, and flew a further five sorties during April and May. Manser was promoted to flying officer on 6 May.

Participating in Operation Millenium, a bombing raid on Cologne on the night of 30 May 1942, Manser was captain and first pilot of Avro Manchester bomber &#x27;D&#x27; for Dog. As he came over the target, his aircraft was caught in searchlights and although he bombed the target successfully from it was hit by flak. In an effort to escape the anti-aircraft fire he took violent evasive action, this reduced his altitude to only but he did not escape the flak until he was clear of the city. By this time the rear gunner was wounded, the front cabin full of smoke and the port engine overheating. Rather than abandon the aircraft and be captured, Manser tried to get the aircraft and crew to safety. The port engine then burst into flames, burning the wing and reducing airspeed to a dangerously low level. The crew made preparations to abandon the aircraft, by then barely controllable and with a crash inevitable. The aircraft was by now over Belgium, and Manser ordered the crew to bail out but refused the offer of a parachute for himself. He remained at the controls and sacrificed himself in order to save his crew. As the crew parachuted down they saw the bomber crash in flames into a dyke at Bree, Belgium, north east of Genk.

Pilot Officer Barnes was taken prisoner, but Sergeant Baveystock, Pilot Officer Horsley, Sergeant King, Sergeant Mills and Sergeant Naylor all evaded capture and made their way back to the United Kingdom. The testimonies of the five evaders were instrumental in the posthumous award of the Victoria Cross for Manser. The citation for the award read:

Manser is buried at the Heverlee War Cemetery in Leuven, Belgium.

Manser was the brother-in-law of British Army captain John Neil Randle, who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross in 1944.

==Legacy==
On part of the old RAF Skellingthorpe airfield from which Manser flew his last sortie, a new primary school was built. It was opened in 1981 and named the Leslie Manser Primary School. On 31 June 2004 a Memorial to Manser was unveiled in natural domain the &quot;Zig&quot;, Stamprooierbroek near Molenbeersel, Kinrooi in the north-east of Belgium.

Manser&#x27;s Victoria Cross is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>The National Institute of Engineering (NIE) is a private engineering college located in Mysuru, Karnataka, India. It was established in 1946 and affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University.

==History==
NIE was started in 1946 with diploma programs in Civil Engineering in a room under a thatched roof in Lakshmipuram under leadership of kushagra. The first batch consisted of 86 students. Later, the classes were held in a shed in the nearby Sharada Vilas High School campus, in Mysore. S. Ramaswamy, D. V. Narasimha Rao and T. Ramarao (&quot;Tunnel&quot; Ramarao), the founders, established NIE by 1950 with its own class rooms and workshops on a campus.
NIE started AMIE courses in Civil Engineering for intermediate-passed students in 1948. The students were permitted to change over to the regular degree course leading to B.E. degree in Civil Engineering of the University of Mysore. Thus, NIE became the second engineering college in the state of Karnataka and the first in Mysore. The first batch of students in Civil Engineering graduated in 1953.

A Golden Jubilee Complex was completed in 1996 on a plot opposite the main building in part of the golden jubilee celebrations. In 2004, the college received World Bank aid under the TEQIP project. The funds obtained were used to strengthen the Centres of Excellence in the college and to set up new ones.

In 2007, NIE attained autonomy under Visvesvaraya Technological University. In 2011, NIE received further World Bank aid under the TEQIP-II. These funds were used to augment the postgraduate programs.

In March 2019, the government of Karnataka approved a private university status for NIE society through notification of &quot;The NIE University Act 2019&quot;, and it was set to start NIE University with D.A. Prasanna was designated the founder chancellor. However, the plan was cancelled due to financial constraints and NIE continues to be an autonomous institute under Visvesvaraya Technological University.

==Location and campus==
The institute is presently located on Mananthavady Road and Koorgalli (adjacent to BEML), Mysore Spread across 25 acres. The NIE Administrative Block houses the administrative offices, libraries, a gymnasium, department offices, laboratories, bank, several workshops.

<text>Major General Clifford Coffin, (10 February 1870 – 4 February 1959) was a British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born in Blackheath, the son of Lieutenant General Sir Isaac Coffin, Clifford Coffin was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers in February 1888. He served in the Second Boer War and was mentioned in despatches.

==Military career==
Coffin was 47 years old, and a temporary brigadier general, having been promoted to that rank temporarily in January 1917, commanding the 25th Infantry Brigade during the First World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross for &quot;most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty&quot;.

On 31 July 1917 in Westhoek, Belgium, Coffin&#x27;s brigade had been shattered attempting to cross the marshy ground around the Hanebeek stream. According to his citation in the London Gazette: &quot;When his command had been held up in attack owing to heavy machine-gun and rifle fire from front and right flank, and was establishing itself in a forward shell-hole line, he went forward and made an inspection of his front posts. Though under the heaviest fire from both machine-guns and rifles, and in full view of the enemy, he showed an utter disregard of personal danger, walking quietly from shell-hole to shell-hole, giving advice and cheering his men by his presence. His very gallant conduct had the greatest effect on all ranks, and it was largely owing to his personal courage and example that the shell-hole line was held in spite of the very heaviest fire. Throughout the day his calm courage and example exercised the greatest influence over all with whom he came into contact, and it is generally agreed that Brigadier-General Coffin&#x27;s splendid example saved the situation, and had it not been for his action the line would certainly have been driven back&quot;.

In May 1918 Coffin, who in January was made a brevet colonel, was promoted to the temporary rank of major general and succeeded Major General Oliver Nugent as general officer commanding (GOC) of the 36th (Ulster) Division, leading the division for the remainder of the war.

Later, Coffin served as Officer Commanding Troops, Ceylon and aide-de-camp to King George V. He later achieved the permanent rank of major general and was colonel commandant of the Royal Engineers.

Coffin died in February 1959 and is buried at Holy Trinity Churchyard, Colemans Hatch, East Sussex. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Chatham, Kent. In 2012, his grave was renovated by the Victoria Cross Trust.

<doc id="1223033" wikidata="Q1068969" url="?curid=1223033" title="Boss key">
<text>A boss key, or boss button, is a special keyboard shortcut used in PC games or other programs to hide the program quickly, possibly displaying a special screen that appears to be a normal productivity program (such as a spreadsheet application). One of the earliest implementations was by Friendlyware, a suite of entertainment and general interest programs written in BASIC and sold with the original IBM AT and XT computers from 1982 to 1985. When activated (by pressing F10), an ASCII bar graph with generic &quot;Productivity&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; labels appeared. Pressing F10 again would return to the Friendlyware application.

==In PC games==
The nominal purpose of the boss key is to make it appear to superiors and coworkers that employees are doing their job when they are actually playing games or using the Internet for non work-related tasks. It was a fairly common feature in early computer games for personal computers, because at the time people often did not have home computers and playing at work was their only option. Most boss keys were used to show dummy DOS prompts. The use has faded somewhat, as modern multitasking operating systems have evolved. However, some programs still retain a boss key feature, such as instant messaging clients or their add-ons or comic book viewers like MComix.

The boss key was first used in the Apple II game &quot;Bezare&quot;, published by Southwestern Data Systems. The idea of it was proposed by Roger Wagner (founder of Southwestern Data Systems, and later Roger Wagner Publishing) on a hang-gliding trip in Mexico in March, 1981, in a conversation between Roger Wagner and Doug Carlston (of Broderbund Software). Steve Wozniak, Andy Hertzfeld and a number of other early personal computing pioneers were also part of that event. Wes Cherry, the author of the original Microsoft Solitaire, had included a boss key to display a fake spreadsheet or random C code, but was asked by his superiors to remove this on release.

Another early example of the boss key is in the IBM PC version of &quot;Asylum&quot;, which clears the screen when F9 is pressed. Certain games have taken the idea of the boss key and used it to comic effect. Infocom&#x27;s adult-themed &quot;Leather Goddesses of Phobos&quot; (only the IBM PC version) had a boss key which would hide the game and show a screen designed to look like a &quot;Cornerstone&quot; database view. Upon closer inspection, however, the screen was not exactly boss safe, being populated with order info on rather ridiculous adult items, including an &quot;inflatable milkman&quot;. Sierra On-Line&#x27;s comedy/sci-fi adventure game &quot;Space Quest III&quot; had a so-called boss key available from the game&#x27;s pulldown menu. However, when the user selected it, the game would call out the user on trying to avoid attention, display how long the user had been playing the game, and state &quot;being the good company men that we are, we can&#x27;t help you cheat like that.&quot; The first few games in Sierra&#x27;s &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot; series included a boss key in the pulldown menus (shortcut usually Ctrl+B). However, when this is used, it results in an instantaneous game over, with the first game saying &quot;Sorry, but you&#x27;ll have to restore your game; when you panic, I forget everything!&quot;. Game creator Al Lowe explained this as being done for speed reasons, since saving the player’s position would take additional time. The boss key for the computer submarine game &quot;GATO&quot; was the Esc key, which, when pressed, brought up a Lotus 1-2-3 type spreadsheet screen.

===Microsoft&#x27;s implementation===
In 1993, Microsoft introduced a five-pack collection of games whose &quot;boss button&quot; was the ESC key, positioned in the upper left corner of the keyboard. This is in contrast to the use of two keys, the CTRL key plus the letter &quot;B&quot; (for &quot;boss&quot;). Moreover, to demonstrate the power of Windows, it could fill the entire screen or just a portion thereof.

==In popular culture==
The boss button has appeared on every NCAA tournament since the 2005 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament website for March Madness, which allowed viewers to watch every game.

==Alternatives==
On modern operating systems, applications may be minimized or switched to the background with a keyboard shortcut. Under desktop environments with multiple workspaces, one possibility is to maintain one &quot;boss&quot; workspace and to switch to it when the boss is coming. A 2014 newspaper article titled &quot;How to watch the Olympics at work without getting caught&quot; described a Mozilla Firefox feature that provides a keyboard shortcut named PanicButton.

<text>The Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center (or PATAC) is a joint venture between General Motors and SAIC Motor. It is a design and engineering center in Pudong, Shanghai, China, and is involved in engineering for Shanghai GM products, but also functions as one out of six technical development and design centers worldwide of General Motors. 

==Overview==
PATAC has prepared several global GM vehicles for the Chinese market. From PATAC&#x27;s own development come the Chevrolet Sail and the second generation Buick GL8. The facelifted Chevrolet Aveo (T200) sedan was also designed in collaboration with PATAC. The centre is also creating every two years a concept car, a total of seven until 2013. Among them two concepts of a new Buick Riviera, in 2007 and 2013.

PATAC disposes of various facilities for design and for motor vehicle development and evaluation, among them a climate wind tunnel, opened on March 27, 2012.

PATAC also manages together with Shanghai GM the 5.67-square-kilometer proving ground in Guangde County, Anhui () with 60 km test roads, opened on September 22, 2012.

The joint-venture PATAC is not to be confused with GM China&#x27;s own GM China Advanced Technical Center (ATC), which is located in Shanghai next to the GM China headquarters.

<text>Alan Jerrard, VC (3 December 1897 – 14 May 1968) was an English aviator and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

An officer of the South Staffordshire Regiment he was 20 years old when, attached as a lieutenant in No. 66 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, he performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Early life==
Jerrard was born in Lewisham in 1897 and moved in 1902 with his family to Sutton Coldfield where his father was headmaster of Bishop Vesey&#x27;s Grammar School for 24 years . Later Jerrard attended Oundle School in Northamptonshire and Birmingham University.

==First World War==
Jerrard volunteered for the British Army and served with the 5th South Staffordshire Regiment before transferring to the Royal Flying Corps in 1916, where he trained as a fighter pilot.

From mid-1917, he served in No. 19 Squadron RFC in France, but he was injured in an air crash on 5 August 1917, flying a SPAD VII. From 22 February 1918, he served in No. 66 Squadron RFC in Italy, as a lieutenant, flying Sopwith Camels. Between 27 February and 21 March he scored four aerial victories, including one balloon.

===Victoria Cross===
Jerrard was awarded the VC for the following deed:

On 30 March 1918 near Mansuè, Italy, Lieutenant Jerrard, with two other officers, Peter Carpenter and Harold Ross Eycott-Martin, on offensive patrol, shot down one of five enemy aircraft. Then flying at 50 ft. he attacked an aerodrome with some 19 machines either landing or attempting to take off. After destroying one of these he was attacked by more enemy aircraft but, seeing a brother-officer in difficulties, went to assist him, destroying a third enemy machine, then continued his attacks, only retreating, with five machines in pursuit, on the orders of the patrol leader. Even then, he repeatedly turned to beat off the enemy until finally forced down.

After the war records revealed that the Camel&#x27;s opponents were four Austrian Albatros D.III (Oef) fighters, one of which was damaged and had to land, while another pilot was injured by a bullet. Jerrard was shot down by the ace Benno Fiala von Fernbrugg from Flik 51/J, and became a prisoner of war. Although the RFC credited Jerrard with 3 claims on this date, Jerrard himself did not claim to destroy any planes in that skirmish, only that he claimed to shoot one up. He was the only Camel pilot to be awarded a VC.

Jerrard remained a prisoner until the end of 1918, when he managed to escape and reach Allied lines. He later served in Russia in 1919 and achieved the rank of flight lieutenant.
Jerrard&#x27;s VC and other medals are displayed on rotation in the Imperial War Museum.

<text>The BR Standard Class 7, otherwise known as the &quot;Britannia&quot; Class, is a class of 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; steam locomotive designed under Robert Riddles for use by British Railways for mixed-traffic duties. 55 were constructed between 1951 and 1954. The design employed results from the 1948 locomotive exchanges undertaken in advance of further locomotive classes being constructed. Three batches were constructed at Crewe Works, before the publication of the 1955 Modernisation Plan.

The &quot;Britannia&quot; Class design was based on best practice from the pre-nationalisation railway companies in terms of operating efficiency and lower maintenance costs; various weight-saving measures also increased the route availability of a &quot;Pacific&quot;-type locomotive on the British Railways network. The &quot;Britannias&quot; received a positive reception from their crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving them favourable reports as regards performance. However, operation in some areas of the British Railway network returned negative feedback, primarily due to indifferent operation of the locomotive, with its effects on adhering to timetables. They were capable of reaching speeds of up to 90 mph (145 km/h).

The &quot;Britannias&quot; took their names from great Britons, former Star class locomotives, and Scottish firths. The class remained in service until the last was withdrawn in 1968. Two survived into preservation, the first-of-class, number 70000 &quot;Britannia&quot;, and 70013 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;. Number 70000 has hauled mainline excursions and 70013, after a period of display following limited steaming, returned to mainline steam in 2008 for the first time since leaving British Railways ownership. 70000 was returned to the main line in 2011.

==Background==

Locomotive exchanges were commissioned by the fledgling British Railways (BR) during 1948, to compare pre-nationalisation locomotive design across the &quot;Big Four&quot; railway companies. The research gained from operating the best designs of the GWR, LMS, LNER and Southern railways on different areas of the British Railways network paved the way for several new classes of standardised locomotives intended to replace some of the ageing designs inherited.

The new classes were designed by E. S. Cox, under Robert Riddles who had previously designed the WD Austerity 2-8-0 and WD Austerity 2-10-0 locomotives for wartime use. The first design requested by the Railway Executive was for a new express passenger &quot;Pacific&quot; locomotive, designed specifically to reduce maintenance and using the latest available innovations in steam technology from home and abroad. Various labour-saving devices were utilised to produce a simple, standard and effective design, able to produce equivalent power to some of the &quot;Pacifics&quot; that were still available as legacies of the Big Four.

==Design features==

The design of the &quot;Britannias&quot; was based on best practice from the pre-nationalisation railway companies. For example, they utilised a variation of both boiler and trailing truck of the Merchant Navy class, while weight was kept within the margins laid down by the Light Pacifics, all of which were designed by Oliver Bulleid. The firebox was also similar in having a rocking grate, which allowed the fire to be rebuilt without stopping the locomotive, removing both ash and clinker on the move; but unlike the SR Pacifics, the inner firebox was constructed of copper instead of steel and lacked thermic syphons.

The &quot;Britannias&quot; had driving wheels, a compromise for their mixed-traffic role to allow sustained fast running with passenger trains, yet small enough to give sufficient tractive effort for freight haulage.

The largest, only outside, cylinders capable of giving maximum tractive effort whilst staying within the British loading gauge were used for ease of maintenance compared with &quot;inside&quot; cylinders located between the frames of a three- or four-cylindered locomotive. Boiler &#x27;plumbing&#x27; was also generally exposed to give ease of access. For ease of maintenance, outside Walschaerts valve gear was used.

A self-cleaning smokebox enabled ash to be ejected through the chimney, reducing the workload of the engine cleaner at the end of a working day. The single chimney was unusual for a &quot;Pacific&quot; type of locomotive, but was chosen because the exhaust dimensions including the blastpipe were designed using work done at the Rugby test plant and by S.O. Ell at Swindon Works, who claimed that &quot;better results could be obtained from a well-designed single chimney than some of the previous double chimney arrangements&quot;.

The design also featured raised running plates above the wheels, which allowed easy access to the inside of the frames for purposes of lubrication.

The &quot;Britannias&#x27;&quot; footplate was designed around the requirements of the operating crews, with a mock-up being constructed at Crewe to test ergonomics and usability.

Two injectors were fitted, one on each side of the boiler, securely fixed to the firebox foundation ring to eliminate problems previously experienced with fractured pipework on frame-mounted injectors. The injector on the left of the firebox was a GWR-type live steam injector, that on the right was an 11 mm Davies and Metcalfe exhaust steam injector. These injectors fed the boiler through clack valves of SR design. Unlike the smaller BR Standard locos the exhaust steam manifold within the smokebox saddle (along with the BR Standard Class 6 engines) was an intricate steel casting.

==Construction history==

Designed at British Railways&#x27; Derby Works, the new class was constructed at British Railways&#x27; Crewe Works between 1951 and 1954. The initial order was for 25 locomotives, but such was the demand for the &quot;Britannias&quot; on the Eastern Region that more were rushed through construction before the teething problems had been ironed out on the prototypes. In total, 55 members of the class were constructed over three batches at Crewe Works, where each was given improvements to improve reliability and efficiency, and to overcome flaws with the original design.
* First batch: 70000–70024, constructed between January and October 1951
* Second batch: 70025–70044, constructed between September 1952 and October 1953
* Third batch: 70045–70054, constructed in 1954.

===Variations and modifications===

Problems with the class were experienced immediately, with the first 25 locomotives being withdrawn in October 1951 after several complaints were received from crews regarding the driving wheels shifting on their axles. They were subsequently modified, and released back into revenue-earning service. Initially the return cranks on the main driving wheels were of LNER block type, as seen on Arthur Peppercorn&#x27;s A1s and A2s, but this was changed to the simpler LMS four-stud fitting. This was the result of a problem of overheating bearings within the cranks, and difficulty in removing the LNER-type casings. 70035–70039 were built with roller bearings on the leading and trailing coupled axles only and plain bearings on the remaining axles, whilst 70040–70049 were built with plain bearings throughout. However throughout their service the roller bearings used in remaining cases showed no advantage in reliability or cost.

An unusual fault with the first engines of the class was fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt passengers to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment on top of the tender to work their way forward into the cab. The passengers&#x27; complaints were dealt with by reducing the tension in the drawbar spring.

Locomotive tenders were also changed as new, improved designs became available. Some examples of the second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A tender, which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 gallons. Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, due to the fact that they were intended for use on longer runs in the north of the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members to mount the tender to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.

Nos.70043 and 70044 were delivered with Westinghouse airbrakes fitted alongside the smokebox and with no smoke deflectors. The two locomotives, which looked radically different from the rest of the class, were allocated to Manchester (Longsight) and ran a series of brake trials on the London Midland main line during the mid-1950s. Subsequently, both had the equipment removed and deflectors fitted.
No. 70045 was fitted with LMS-style oval buffers in the course of repairs after collision damage.

On 21 January 1960, the Settle rail crash, which cost the lives of five passengers, was caused when the piston rod, cross-head and connecting rod of No. 70052 came loose and damaged the opposite line as a freight train was approaching. The locomotive of the freight train was derailed towards 70052&#x27;s train and tore out the sides of three passenger coaches. Part of the slide assembly was redesigned, and was fitted as the locomotives were routinely &quot;shopped&quot;.

Western Region based examples had hand/foot holds cut into the smoke deflectors replacing the original handrails after a major derailment, to improve forward visibility. Some of these deflectors subsequently migrated to other members of the class.

===Naming===

From 1948 until the mid-1950s, the responsibility for recommending names for locomotives on British Railways rested with a Locomotive Naming Committee of three senior railway officers, E. S. Cox, George Dow with Derek Barrie as chairman.

The Committee set itself several rules and over the years developed many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.

The name that was to be bestowed on the first class member caused great debate on the committee and the wider executive of British Railways. However noted enthusiast Bishop Eric Treacy suggested the name &quot;Britannia&quot;. This set the general theme of the naming process, which featured great Britons, although several deviations from the theme were allowed. These exceptions were allocated to those that operated on the Western Region, which were given names of former Star Class locomotives, and those of the Scottish Region, which were granted the names of the various Scottish firths. The locomotive naming ceremonies were carried out at various railway stations around the British Railways network. No. 70047 was never named.

== Operational details ==

The class was well liked by crews in most regions of British Railways, with especially glowing reports from those operating them from Stratford depot on the Eastern Region, where its lower weight and high power transformed motive power over the restricted East Anglian lines. However, negative feedback was received from various operating departments, most notably on the Western Region. The criticism was primarily out of partisan preference for GWR-designed locomotive stock among Western Region staff; in particular, the class was &#x27;left-hand drive&#x27; in contrast to &#x27;right-hand drive&#x27; GWR locomotive and signalling practice, a factor in the Milton rail crash of 1955.

For this reason, the Western Region locomotive depots at Old Oak Common TMD and Plymouth Laira declared that the class was surplus to requirements. However Cardiff Canton depot displayed its liking for the class (despite being part of the former GWR empire) and managed to obtain good results on South Wales passenger traffic.

The London Midland Region also had favourable reports, but a marked consistency in losing time on the longer runs between Holyhead and Euston was recorded, although all complaints were down to the individual techniques of the operating crews. This was compounded by the irregular allocation of the class to depots all over the network, meaning that few crews ever had a great deal of experience in driving them. The Southern Region also had an allocation of seven in May 1953, when all Merchant Navy Class locomotives were temporarily withdrawn for inspection after 35020 &quot;Bibby Line&quot; sheared a crank axle on the central driving wheel.

Repairs to the class were undertaken at Crewe, Swindon and Doncaster Works until the financial constraints of the British Railways Modernisation Plan in terms of expenditure on steam began to preclude the regular of locomotives. During the mid-1960s s were carried out exclusively at Crewe Works. The first locomotive to be withdrawn from service was number 70007 &quot;Coeur-de-Lion&quot; in 1965, and the entire class was gradually transferred to Carlisle Kingmoor and Glasgow Polmadie depots as steam was displaced by the dieselisation of British Railways. Some members of this class were a common sight in the Cumbrian main line, pulling both passenger trains and parcel trains in Grange-over-Sands, Barrow-in-Furness, Preston, and other locations in the area. A succession of bulk withdrawals began in 1967, and the last, of number 70013 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;, took place in 1968, at the very end of steam operation in Britain. Subsequently, that locomotive was selected to represent the class in the National Collection. Only 70000 &quot;Britannia&quot;, which was privately preserved, saw main line service during the preservation era – until 2008, when 70013 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;&#x27;s restoration was completed, and she worked part of the &quot;15 Guinea Special&quot; – a special train run to commemorate the final BR steam working in 1968. 70013 is now to be found operating main line railtours over the Network Rail system.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 20 November 1955, locomotive No. 70026 &quot;Polar Star&quot; was hauling an excursion train that was derailed at Milton, Oxfordshire due to excessive speed through a crossover. Eleven people were killed and 157 were injured.
*On 21 January 1960, locomotive No. 70052 &quot;Firth of Tay&quot; was hauling an express passenger train that was derailed at Settle, Yorkshire due to a defect on the locomotive. Five people were killed and nine were injured.
*On 5 June 1965, locomotive 70051 &quot;Firth of Forth&quot; was hauling a passenger train when a blowback of the fire occurred near . Driver Wally Oakes managed to safely bring the train to a stand, but both he and fireman Gwilym Roberts were severely injured. Oakes died a week later. He was awarded the George Cross and the Carnegie Hero Trust bronze medal for his actions. Class 86 locomotive 86 260 was later named &quot;Wallace Oakes G.C.&quot; in his honour.
*On 30 July 1966, locomotive No. 70017 &quot;Arrow&quot; was hauling a set of empty coaches from Carlisle Citadel when it was derailed at Carlisle St Nicholas after a rear-end collision with a goods train on the Carlisle Joint Goods Line. The locomotive would later be withdrawn from service owing to the damage received in the accident and derailment.
*On 27 May 2012, locomotive No. 70013 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot; was involved in a blowback incident at Wood Green tunnel near New Southgate station in North London on a Railway Touring Company railtour called &#x27;The Peak Forester&#x27;. Two of the three crew on board the locomotive had to attend hospital as a result. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch investigation was conducted after the accident.
*On 22 August 2023, locomotive No. 70000 &quot;Britannia&quot; while hauling a Steam Dreams circular tour around the Surrey Hills suffered a catastrophic failure of its right side crosshead just after passing through Chilworth. Following an inspection by the engines support crew it was discovered that the crosshead had snapped in two and the piston had disconnected then damaged the front cylinder cover. Under cover of darkness with a blockade in place the right side connecting rod had to be removed and then 70000 was towed behind a diesel and its train back to London Victoria via Guildford.

== Livery and numbering ==

The first member of the class was given a livery of plain black without lining; this was changed to the new standard British Railways Dark Locomotive Green that was applied to express passenger locomotives after nationalisation, despite the locomotive being classed as mixed traffic. This was lined in orange and black, and the class was given the power classification 7MT. The &quot;Britannias&quot; were numbered under the new British Railways standard numbering system in the 70xxx series. The locomotives were numbered between 70000 and 70054, and featured brass nameplates with an initial black background, followed by red, located on the smoke deflectors. Towards the end of steam plain green livery was substituted, with the touching-up of existing paintwork being preferred to full aesthetic overhaul.

== Preservation ==
Two &quot;Britannias&quot; have survived: the prototype engine number 70000 &quot;Britannia&quot;, and 70013 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;. Both engines have also operated at certain points in preservation as well as both running on the main line in preservation.

Number 70000 was originally selected to represent the class in the embryonic form of the future National Railway Museum, but was ultimately rejected due to the locomotive&#x27;s poor mechanical condition. As a result, 70013 was eventually selected to represent the class for the benefit of future generations. However, 70000 had been purchased privately from British Railways by the Britannia Locomotive Group, which ensured that the doyen of the class was to survive into the preservation era. Subsequently, utilised on mainline railtours, the locomotive was out of use in the late 1990s, requiring work to bring it back to steam; it was eventually sold to Pete Waterman and stored at Crewe. After a spell in storage on the Bressingham Steam Museum in Diss, Norfolk, 70013 was moved to the Great Central Railway (preserved), following an ownership dispute between Bressingham and the National Railway Museum. The locomotive returned to steam in May 2008 on the Great Central Railway after the readers of Steam Railway magazine contributed towards its overhaul. In July 2008 it appeared in WCRC&#x27;s Open Weekend at Steamtown, Carnforth. August saw the locomotive return to the main line. Its first turn was the 1T57 &#x27;Fifteen Guinea Special&#x27; re-run from Manchester to Carlisle, 40 years after it performed the same duty in 1968. As a result, both preserved members of the class have operated on the mainline in preservation.

After its sale to the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust, 70000 was overhauled at Crewe and returned to the main line in 2011 (its 60th anniversary), initially in unlined black without name plates as originally outshopped in 1951 (the plates were first fitted for the Festival of Britain later that year).

<text>Ion Mihalache (; March 3, 1882 – February 5, 1963) was a Romanian agrarian politician, the founder and leader of the Peasants&#x27; Party (PȚ) and a main figure of its successor, the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ).

==Early life==
A schoolteacher born into a peasant family of Topoloveni, Muscel County, he served as a lieutenant in the Romanian Army during World War I. Mihalache, who soon became popular among Orthodox priests and village teachers, served as president of the local teachers&#x27; association.

He founded the PȚ in the Romanian Old Kingdom in 1918; under his leadership, it emerged from northern Muntenia and became a grouping with national appeal. The PȚ had much success in the elections of November 1919, forming a coalition government with the Transylvanian Romanian National Party (PNR), under Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. As a politician, Mihalache made himself known for supporting a political option that mixed traditionalist reserve towards industrialization and calls for preserving the rural base of Romanian economy through voluntary cooperative farming (allowing for a peasant-based industry) with a vision of left-wing Corporatism. In 1929, he wrote:
&quot;Many have thought that [economic success] was only possible for the large-scale agricultural entrepreneur. And this is why they have supported that only on the basis of large-scale property can there be carried out a wise and lucrative agriculture, and that dividing the land leads to a decrease in production.Perhaps it would be this way, if the small-scale agricultural entrepreneur will not &#x27;organize&#x27; himself and will not enlighten himself.But the cure was found: the association of peasants into agricultural cooperatives, which bring: money, as well as utensils, as well as &quot;regulated sales&quot;, as well as &quot;industrialization&quot;.&quot;

He notably took the initiative in calling for peaceful marches of peasants and members of the rural intelligentsia, and would almost always dress in accordance with the peasant tradition of his native Muscel County.

==1919-1920==
Mihalache became Vaida-Voevod&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture on December 16, 1919, in a cabinet replacing that of General Artur Văitoianu. Despite having led a populist movement, the People&#x27;s Party, Averescu continuously opposed Mihalache&#x27;s push for widespread land reform.

The new minister found himself at odds with the political establishment over the issue of land redistribution: promised by Ion I. C. Brătianu&#x27;s National Liberal (PNL) government during World War I, and partly carried out in December 1918, the move viewed as incomplete - expropriations had not led to a redefinition of peasant property, and land had remained with provisional cooperatives instead of being allocated to members. Mihalache supported the fragmentation of all land property in a country of medium to small sized landowners. The Peasants&#x27; Party calculated leaving no landowner with more than on one square kilometre, which also included expropriating land for common pasture. At the same time, Vaida-Voevod&#x27;s government created a conflict over its projects for constitutional reform, clashing with the PNL over the highly centralized government and support for the 1866 Constitution of Romania advocated by the latter. Mihalache is also known to have traveled incognito to various locations, as a means to observe first-hand abuse by government officials.

After a deadlock over these issues in Parliament, Averescu&#x27;s group and the National Liberals began negotiation a new parliamentary majority; advised by Nicolae Iorga, who was president of the Chamber, Mihalache handed in his resignation (March 12, 1920), with the expectation that the land reform project was to be endorsed by parliamentary initiative. It was advanced later in the same day by the PȚ&#x27;s Grigore Iunian. King Ferdinand I intervened in favor of the National Liberals, installing Averescu, who had reached an agreement with Brătianu, as Prime Minister.

A major factor in this move was pressure from the landowners to remove a threat to the system (notably, Constantin Garoflid filed a complaint with the king, while Mihalache caused scandal when he publicly assured peasants that the monarch&#x27;s opposition was ultimately irrelevant. At the same time, the PȚ&#x27;s politics had given way to fears that it was a Romanian equivalent of Aleksandar Stamboliyski&#x27;s Agrarian Union of Bulgaria, or even a parallel to Bolshevism. To the latter accusation, Mihalache once replied indicating, as other leaders of his party had done, his belief that the peasant&#x27;s needs identified with the national interest:
&quot;Thus — after so many years of &#x27;harmony&#x27;, we arrive today as the &#x27;agitators of social order&#x27; and clearly state:&quot;Enough with the lie about social harmony. There is a conflict between social classes. We do not deny it, but rather bring it to light. We wish to take part in the fight in the name of an underprivileged working class, the peasantry. We wish to rally it in a class party. We shall not ask anybody for power, we shall fight to have the fair number of representatives of the peasant class in Parliament. May each class fight for this&quot; [that is, for their respective seats] &quot;and parliament will give itself the government it sees fit.&quot;As for &quot;social harmony&quot; — as this has been up to now — we demand &quot;a particular&quot; balance between producing classes and wish for &quot;the abolition of parasite classes&quot; such as that of &quot;untrained politicians&quot;.[...]&#x27;Bolshevism&#x27;, cry the parasite politicians, accustomed to govern together with the highest power and their cries also alert the gentle folk, whose political judgment is chained in &#x27;harmony&#x27;-related prejudice.— &#x27;Truth is not anarchy&#x27; — we reply.&quot;

The land reform that was ultimately carried out did however reflect the influence of some ideas supported by Mihalache, and was itself favorable to small holdings.

==PȚ-PNR union==

Mihalache became vice-president of the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ) in 1926, when the PNR and PȚ groups decided to unite in order to combat the effective monopoly the PNL had ensured after the voting of the 1923 Constitution. The new political group moderated many of its demands, and was not as adverse to industrialization as it had previously been. However, in 1928, Mihalache&#x27;s voiced the party&#x27;s call for a march on Bucharest, meant to topple Vintilă Brătianu&#x27;s PNL cabinet: in May, large crowds gathered in Alba Iulia — despite the initial success in rallying all forces opposed to the National Liberals, the PNȚ did not capitalize on the gains, and continued instead to block activity in parliament.

He served as Minister of Agriculture in the Iuliu Maniu&#x27;s government of 1928–1930 (being seconded by Armand Călinescu), then, between 1930 and 1933, he was the Minister of Internal Affairs (he also held the office of Foreign Minister between late 1930 and early 1931). In this latter capacity, Mihalache outlawed the fascist Iron Guard in January 1931 (under the premiership of Gheorghe Mironescu), following a period of violence and agitation by the movement. The measure was to prove inefficient in time, as the new cabinet allowed Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, leader of the Guard, to run in the 1931 elections on a new platform (the &quot;Corneliu Codreanu Grouping&quot;).

During the period, he also became a noted opponent of Carol II: as heir apparent, the latter had been denied the right of ascension after the war, and returned to the throne with Maniu&#x27;s backing in 1930. The relations between the PNȚ and the monarch soured, however, especially after Vaida-Voevod&#x27;s second cabinet fell in 1932, due to disagreement over several policies — as Minister of the Interior, Mihalache was directly involved in the dispute, as the scandal erupted when Gavrilă Marinescu, the prefect of police in Bucharest, refused to hand in his resignation, and instead called for the king&#x27;s verdict. In 1935, Mihalache briefly took charge of the party upon Maniu&#x27;s resignation, and steered it to the Left, charging Mihai Ralea and the PNȚ&#x27;s Study Circle (Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Mihail Ghelmegeanu, Ernest Ene, and Petre Andrei) with drafting a new party program that adapted Poporanist ideals.

After 1938, when, faced with the rise of the Iron Guard, Carol imposed his authoritarian regime, the PNȚ party refused collaboration and merger into the National Renaissance Front. According to the leading party member Ioan Hudiță, Mihalache, together with Virgil Madgearu and Mihai Popovici, continued to display support for the king and even considered joining the Front.

==World War II and after==
During World War II, he opposed the National Legionary State created by the Iron Guard, and complained to the Guard&#x27;s rival partner, &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu, that Horia Sima and his grouping had assumed control of his cooperative organization in Muscel County. Antonescu refused to mediate; Sima replied to Mihalache that the measure had been partly taken as compensation for the Legionaries&#x27; &quot;suffering at the hands of Mihalache [in 1930-1931]&quot;, but offered to allow some of the Muscel cooperative&#x27;s former administrators structure to regain their positions. Attacks and threats towards Mihalache in the Guard&#x27;s press became widespread, and Mille Lefter singled him out as a former persecutor of the movement in a conference aired on Romanian Radio.

Following Antonescu&#x27;s defeat of the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion of 1941, Mihalache forwarded a congratulatory message to the former. In time, he also objected to Antonescu&#x27;s Nazi Germany-allied dictatorship (although pressured by the latter to join a War Cabinet). He did, however, support the recovery of Bessarabia from the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa, and offered his services as a volunteer in the Romanian Army (June 1941) — he served for only a few days, and was discharged on orders from Antonescu himself.

He eventually joined a semi-clandestine opposition, and then supported the PNȚ&#x27;s entry into the underground liberation movement, as well as King Michael&#x27;s pro-Allied August 1944 coup.

The appearance of the Iron Curtain and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s plans for Romania singled out the PNȚ, the main supporter of cooperation with the Western Allies, as an adversary of growing Soviet influence over the country (&quot;see Soviet occupation of Romania&quot;). Consequently, he and Maniu were branded &quot;fascists&quot; by the Romanian Communist Party press, and Mihalache was especially attacked for his supposedly good relations with Antonescu; the 1941 episode was used against him during the rigged 1946 elections, when Communists prevented him from running for office based on a law forbidding candidatures of former Eastern Front volunteers. It is possible, however, that just before the elections, the PNȚ had attempted to resist and profit from a foreseen insurrection against the Petru Groza government, by forming &quot;Cercul Militar Professional&quot; (the &quot;Professional Military Circle&quot;) — grouping generals and other officers, it was led by Mihalache himself.

The Communist regime which was installed in late 1947 outlawed the PNȚ altogether, alleging that Mihalache and Maniu had been trying to flee the country from the airfield in Tămădău, and had planned to give Romania a capitalist government-in-exile. Their capture on July 14, 1947 (&quot;see Tămădău Affair&quot;) and trial by a kangaroo court led to sentencing on November 11 to life imprisonment with requirements of penal labour. Mihalache, after having been detained in a prison in Galați, was transferred to Sighet Prison on 15 August 1951. In 1955 he was moved to Râmnicu Sărat Prison, where he died in custody on February 5, 1963, the cause of death being attributed in the official report to cerebral edema.

<doc id="1223064" wikidata="Q266984" url="?curid=1223064" title="Risa Wataya">
<text>is a female Japanese novelist from Kyoto. Her short novel &quot;Keritai senaka&quot; won the Akutagawa Prize and has sold more than a million copies. Wataya has also won the Bungei Prize and the Kenzaburo Oe Prize. Her work has been translated into German, Italian, French, Thai, Korean, and English.

==Biography==

Wataya was born in Kyoto, Japan. Her mother was a university English teacher, and her father worked for a clothing company. At age 17, she told her parents that she was working on her university entrance exams, but she was actually writing her first novella, titled &quot;Insutōru&quot; (&quot;Install&quot;). &quot;Insutōru&quot; won the 38th Bungei Prize in 2001. It was later adapted into a 2004 film of the same name, starring Aya Ueto.

After graduating from Murasakino High School in Kyoto, Wataya attended Waseda University, where her thesis focused on the structure of Osamu Dazai&#x27;s &quot;Hashire merosu&quot; (走れ、メロス &quot;Run, Melos!&quot;). In 2004, while a second-year student at Waseda, Wataya received the Akutagawa Prize for her short novel &quot;Keritai senaka&quot; (&quot;The Back You Want to Kick&quot;). Wataya shared the prize with Hitomi Kanehara, another young, female author. At the age of 19, Wataya became the youngest author and only the third student ever to win the Akutagawa Prize. An English version of &quot;Keritai senaka&quot; was published 12 years later under the title &quot;I Want to Kick You in the Back&quot;.

Wataya did not immediately write more novels after winning the Akutagawa Prize, but rather worked several jobs in Kyoto, including selling clothes in a department store and serving as a hotel waitress. She returned to writing with her 2007 book &quot;Yume wo ataeru&quot; (&quot;Give Me a Dream&quot;), and in 2010 her novel &quot;Katte ni furuetero&quot; (&quot;Tremble All You Want&quot;) became a best-seller in Japan. In 2017 a film adaptation of &quot;Katte ni furuetero&quot;, directed by Akiko Ohku, premiered at the Tokyo International Film Festival and won the festival&#x27;s Audience Award.

Wataya moved back to Kyoto in 2011. In 2012 her novel &quot;Kawaisou da ne?&quot; (&quot;Isn&#x27;t it a pity?&quot;) won the Kenzaburo Oe Prize. Wataya announced her marriage in 2014. Her first child, a son, was born in late 2015.

She is a fan of AKB48.

==Writing style==
Wataya&#x27;s early work focused on strong female protagonists in high school settings. While her writing addresses gender and youth sexuality, media coverage of Wataya&#x27;s first two books tended to portray Wataya as more conservative than Hitomi Kanehara, her contemporary and co-winner of the 130th Akutagawa Prize.

She has said that Junot Díaz, Osamu Dazai, and Haruki Murakami are some of her favorite authors.

<doc id="1223069" wikidata="Q6776904" url="?curid=1223069" title="Martin Winter (mayor)">
<text>Martin Winter was the first elected mayor of Doncaster, England. He was elected in 2002 as the Labour Party candidate and was re-elected in 2005. He completed his final term as an independent after leaving his party.

==Early life==
Martin Winter was a professional rugby league footballer and the son of a local newsagent proprietor and property developer. He went on to win election to Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council.

==Career==
Doncaster became one of the first authorities to adopt the new system for directly elected mayors. In this position, he appointed his own cabinet from among the Councillors.

Winter won re-election in 2005 on the day of the General Election against a split opposition.

After the deaths of seven children in Doncaster, Doncaster council voted that Winter should take responsibility for the failures of the children&#x27;s service and resign. Winter declared that he would govern as an independent mayor, with the support of two of his cabinet members. The Labour Party gave him an ultimatum to back down. The situation then became further confused as he signalled his intention to remain in the Labour Party, but not in its council group. At the same time, the council was faced with two reports from government inspectors, accusing it of serious failures.

==Resignation==
On 29 May 2008, Winter and one other councillor were expelled from the Labour Party. Only the leader of the three-member Community Group and one Liberal Democrat, who was suspended from that party, joined his new cabinet. The members of Doncaster Council supported a motion of no confidence in Mayor Winter on 14 July 2008 by 42 votes to 8 with 7 abstentions. However, Mayor Winter refused to resign and pledged to see out his term of office.

Further calls for Winter&#x27;s resignation followed in January 2009 after the Authority was deemed to be seriously failing in its delivery of social services following the deaths of seven children that were on the local &quot;At Risk&quot; register. The Social Services Department had been understaffed and overextended for some time, and several leading officers had resigned. Winter has again refused to resign following the loss of another &quot;no-confidence&quot; motion.

In March 2009, Mayor Winter announced he would not be standing for re-election in June 2009. In the June 2009 election, he was replaced by English Democrat Peter Davies.
Since leaving politics he has been employed by a Stainforth-based property company.

In April 2015 he published his biography &quot;fall out – loved and trusted... hated &amp; abused...&quot; the memoirs of a mayor .

<text>Samuel Harvey VC (17 September 1881 – 22 September 1960) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 34 years old and a private in the 1st Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 29 September 1915 in the &quot;Big Willie&quot; Trench near the Hohenzollern Redoubt, France, during a heavy bombing (hand grenade) attack, more bombs were urgently required and private Harvey volunteered to fetch them. The communication trench was blocked with wounded and reinforcements and he went backwards and forwards across open ground under intense fire and succeeded in bringing up 30 boxes before he was wounded in the head. It was largely owing to his cool bravery in supplying the bombs that the enemy was eventually driven back.

Harvey received the French Legion of Honour (5th Class) and the Cross of St. George (Russia). He received little recognition in Britain after the war and towards the end of his life resided in the Salvation Army Citadel on Woodbridge Road in Ipswich. He also slept rough outside the Town Hall or in Wolves Wood, near Hadleigh, Suffolk.

Samuel Harvey was buried in Old Ipswich Cemetery on 26 September 1960 in Grave – X-21-3 (Section, Division, Grave no). In March 2014 he was honoured by the planting of a tree near his grave and another tree at Sprites Primary School in Ipswich.

<doc id="1223077" wikidata="Q947345" url="?curid=1223077" title="Turret deck ship">
<text>A turret deck ship is a type of merchant ship with an unusual hull, designed and built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The hulls of turret deck vessels were rounded and stepped inward above their waterlines. This gave some advantages in strength and allowed them to pay lower canal tolls under tonnage measurement rules then in effect. The type ceased to be built after those rules changed. The last turret deck ship in existence was scrapped in 1960.

==Development==
Turret deck ships were inspired by the visit of the US whaleback vessel to Liverpool in 1891. Like others of the type, &quot;Wetmore&quot; had a hull in the form of a flattened cigar, with a continuous curve above the waterline to where the sides met amidships. The superstructure atop the hull was in round or oval &quot;turrets&quot;, so named because of their resemblance to gunhouses on contemporary warships.
In 1893 William Doxford and Sons Ltd. (&quot;Doxford&quot;) of Sunderland, England, built one whaleback under license from the type&#x27;s designer, but had already built its first turret deck ship to a design by Arthur Havers, the concern&#x27;s chief draughtsman. Havers toned down the more radical features of the whaleback. His design retained conventional bows and sterns instead of the upswept conoid &quot;snout&quot; of the whaleback. Instead of a rounded hull, the hull of a turret ship was stepped inward above the waterline, but the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the hull met in curves rather than by right angles as in conventional ships. Finally, the design joined the rounded turrets of whalebacks into one long and narrow rectangular structure (also called a &quot;turret&quot;) of about half the beam, and used that space as part of the hold.
The design was patented. Doxford&#x27;s first ship, &quot;Turret&quot;, was notable for her abnormally long and wide hatches in the turret, and self-trimming due to the rounded shape in the upper hold and lower turret. She was thus ideal for grain. &quot;Turret&quot; was designed for tonnage of at a load line draft of at . With engines aft the design was seen as ideal for the bulk oil trade meeting the latest Suez Canal regulations in which coal bunkers would be separated from oil cargo by a double bulkhead filled with water. The ship had an unusually high righting angle which was obtained whether full or lightly loaded. In particular the design was seen as a solution to the problem of strength and economical cost. On well deck ships the lack of a continuous line of the deck, one the turret ship design solved with a continuous line and solid structure up to the top of the turret, resulted in weakness with classification societies taking notice by requiring increased strengthening in construction. The long, wide hatches were seen as making the design especially suitable for carrying heavy or bulky machinery. That feature later resulted in cargoes such as long, wide girders and a 110-ton gun being easily loaded.

By March 1895 the design had considerable acceptance. Nine ships were in use: &quot;Turret&quot;, &quot;Turret Age&quot;, &quot;Turret Bay&quot;, &quot;Bencliff&quot;, &quot;Turret Bell&quot;, &quot;Progressist&quot;, &quot;Royalist&quot;, &quot;Hopedale&quot; and &quot;Forest Abbey&quot;; and five more were being built.

==Description and design==

In side profile, turret deck ships resembled other merchant ships with flush decks or with small forecastles and poop decks. In cross-section the differences between turret deck ships and more conventional ships are apparent. There was no gunwale; the vertical side of a turret ship curves inward above the load line to a horizontal plane. This flat area was known as the &quot;harbour deck&quot;. Further inboard, this &quot;deck&quot; arced to the vertical again by a reverse curve. That vertical plane then joined the weather deck atop the turret at a right angle. Structurally these elements were part of the hull, not of the superstructure, and the cargo holds of the ship extended up to the true weather deck atop the turret.

This design, and that of its near relative the trunk deck ship, were said to maximize strength, allowing larger ships and reduced the amount of steel needed for construction. In reality, it is more likely that the geometry inhibited the development of cracks in the sheer strake but ships to this design were not any lighter than conventional ships due to their unique geometry. In operation their hull form promoted self-trimming of homogenous cargo and inhibited shifting.
The design also called for a cellular double bottom, which was the probable reason for claims of the type&#x27;s exceptional hull strength, but it also raised the centre of gravity of the cargo. A higher centre of gravity increased the roll period and reduced the violence of rolls. But loading heavy cargo too high, and failing to properly ballast the bottom tanks, raised the centre of gravity and led to instability. This led to accidents, a Board of Trade investigation, and cautions from Doxford on proper loading. The design was also inconvenient, as the narrowness of the turret made for smaller cargo hatches and restricted habitation spaces in the superstructure atop the turret.

Turret deck ships had a low net tonnage (an approximate measure of cargo space) in comparison to their deadweight capacity (weight of cargo), allowing them to operate at a lower fee structure than a conventional hull. Net tonnage is a computation of volume, and the method of measurement used at the Suez Canal to determine tolls was based on a measure of net tonnage which excluded some of the cargo spaces of these unconventional hulls. Turret and trunk deck ships therefore paid less in tolls than conventional ships of the same capacity.

In 1911, the toll measure changed at Suez to account for all cargo spaces, and contemporaneous refinements in the design of ships of more conventional hull form eliminated the structural advantages of turret deck ships. Construction of the type therefore ceased.

==History of use==

Over 180 ships of the type had been built before the design was abandoned, 176 of them by William Doxford and Sons. They were used in both line voyage and tramp service until retired, wrecked, or lost in the First or Second World War. The British Clan Line, which traded globally in cargos such as foodstuffs, timber, metals, manufactured goods, case oil, jute, tea, nitrates, and general cargo, used 32 of the type.

While used for general freight, these ships were particularly suited to the carriage of bulk cargos such as grains, coal, and ores. Several were sold to Canadian interests for use in the latter trades on the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes of North America. The last of them, &quot;Turret Cape&quot;, operated until mid-century and was not scrapped until 1959. Only the former &quot;Nonsuch&quot; was in operation a little longer. The ship was kept in business as &quot;Hermann Fritzen&quot; until 1959 by owner Johs. Fritzen &amp; Sohn of Emden. Finally sold for demolition in April 1959, &quot;Hermann Fritzen&quot; arrived for breaking at Eckhardt &amp; Co. in Hamburg in the first quarter of 1960.

<text>John Gildroy Grant, VC (26 August 1889 – 25 November 1970) was a soldier in the New Zealand Military Forces during the First World War. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that could be awarded at the time to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Hāwera, Grant was a builder when he volunteered in June 1915 to serve in the First World War with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). He was posted to the 1st Battalion of the Wellington Regiment which began its service on the Western Front in 1916. It was on 1 September 1918, during an engagement at Bancourt, France, that he attacked two machine-gun posts, which led to him being awarded with the VC. He ended the war as a second lieutenant. Discharged from the NZEF, he returned to civilian life and then joined the Territorial Force. In his later years, he struggled to hold down regular employment due to the effects of what was most likely post-traumatic stress disorder. He died in 1970 at the age of 81.

==Early life==
John Grant was born on 26 August 1889 in Hāwera, a small town in the Taranaki region of New Zealand. He was one of the nine children of George and Jane Grant, who were both originally from Scotland. He attended Hāwera Main School and when his education was completed, he took up construction work. A volunteer fireman, he was working as a builder when he enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in June 1915.

==First World War==
At the time of Grant&#x27;s enlistment, the main contingent of the NZEF, which had formed the New Zealand and Australian Division, was engaged in the Gallipoli Campaign. After initial training, he embarked for the Middle East in October 1915 with the 7th Reinforcements. He joined the 1st Battalion, Wellington Regiment of the New Zealand Division, then being formed in Egypt in the aftermath of the evacuation from the Gallipoli Peninsula. It embarked for the Western Front in March 1916. Grant served on active duty throughout 1916 and into 1917, during which time his battalion fought in a number of battles, including the Battle of Flers–Courcelette, where about a quarter of its strength became casualties. It also fought in the Battle of Messines, where it was involved in the encirclement of Messines village and captured 200 German soldiers. During its time in the battle, it suffered over 400 killed and wounded. In June 1917, he was promoted to corporal. A few months later, his battalion was one of the leading units in the Battle of Broodseinde. It missed the First Battle of Passchendaele that followed a few days afterward and avoided the heavy casualties that befell the units involved. In early 1918 he was made a sergeant.

From late August to early September 1918, the New Zealand Division was engaged in the Second Battle of Bapaume, which had as its objective the town of Bapaume. On 1 September, near Bancourt, the lead elements of the 1st Battalion came under heavy fire from a series of German machine-gun posts, which threatened their advance. Despite this, Grant&#x27;s platoon pressed on. As they neared one of the posts, Grant, followed by another soldier, Lance Corporal Cecil Hill, broke ahead and entered the post, &quot;demoralising&quot; the crew, according to the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, and allowing his platoon to capture the Germans. Grant attacked another nearby machine-gun post in similar fashion and soon his platoon, and the rest of his company, were able to put the remaining posts out of action. His battalion was relieved that evening. While Hill was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his part in the operation of 1 September, Grant was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation read:

Shortly afterwards, Grant was promoted to second lieutenant and travelled to Cambridge in England for officer training in October 1918. He was wounded in early November, within days of his return to the front. Together with three other New Zealanders who had been awarded the VC, he received his medal from King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 27 February 1919. His service with the NZEF ended with his repatriation to New Zealand later that year. His home town of Hāwera gave him a formal welcome on his return on 29 October and he was presented with an inscribed gold watch.

==Later life==

In April 1921, Grant successfully stood for election as a city councillor for Hawera. Later the same year, he was the best man at the wedding of Harry Laurent, another VC recipient who was also from Hawera. Grant soon married as well, and had two children.

Grant remained involved with military life, serving in the Territorial Force until 1929, by which time he had reached the rank of lieutenant. He was discharged due to his age and also for being unable to attend camp. The same year he went to London to attend a formal dinner for VC recipients. He later worked in Paeroa but found it difficult to gain and maintain employment. By this time, his marriage had broken down and he had been made bankrupt. In 1934, his plight attracted the attention of the authorities. On investigation it was determined it was his own erratic behaviour that was the cause of his difficulties. Undiagnosed at the time, it is thought that Grant could have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

In 1937, Grant, along with several other VC recipients, was awarded the coronation medal to commemorate the ascension of King George VI to the British throne. In 1953, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. He attended the VC centenary event held in London in 1956 and also the VC reunion in 1968. Due to his health at the time, the latter event required public donations to pay for his flights and medical care.

In his final years, Grant became a freemason and lived at the Masonic Village in Mount Roskill in Auckland. He died on 25 November 1970 at the age of 81, and is buried in Auckland&#x27;s Waikumete Cemetery. Streets in Hāwera are named for both Grant and Laurent, in recognition of their VCs. In September 2018, statues of Grant and Laurent were unveiled at Hāwera&#x27;s Victoria Cross garden.

==Medals==
Grant&#x27;s VC, along with his 1914–15 Star, British War Medal, Victory Medal, and coronation medals, is alternately displayed at the QEII Army Memorial Museum in Waiouru and the Puke Ariki in New Plymouth. On 2 December 2007, it was one of nine VCs that were among a hundred medals stolen from the QEII Army Memorial Museum. On 16 February 2008, New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of a NZ$300,000 reward offered by Michael Ashcroft and Tom Sturgess.

<text>Edward James Gibson Holland (2 February 1878 – 18 June 1948) was a Canadian soldier who won the Victoria Cross, the most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions during the Battle of Leliefontein during the Second Boer War.

== Early life ==
Holland was born in Ottawa, Ontario, son of Andrew Holland and Mrs. (Gibson) Holland. He was educated at Ottawa Collegiate Institute (now called Lisgar Collegiate Institute) and at Ottawa Model School (Teachers College).

==Military career==
At the start of the Second Boer War, Holland, at 22 years of age, enlisted as a sergeant in The Royal Canadian Dragoons. He was one of three men from his regiment who were awarded the VC during a desperate rearguard action on 7 November 1900 at the Battle of Leliefontein near the Komati River. (The others were Lieutenant Hampden Zane Churchill Cockburn and Lieutenant Richard Ernest William Turner.)

During a dramatic retreat in the face of a superior force, Turner and Cockburn commanded a small group of men tasked with repulsing a large force of Boers at close range to prevent two 12-pound field guns from being captured. During the action, Holland helped to hold back the Boers using a Colt machine gun mounted on a carriage between the two guns. However, when the Colt machine gun overheated and jammed, Holland was unwilling to let it fall into the hands of the Boers. Realizing that the horse that pulled the machine gun carriage was too exhausted to outrun the Boers, Holland quickly detached the hot weapon from the carriage, caught and mounted a nearby horse and rode from the scene with the machine gun under his arm.

His citation for the Victoria Cross was published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 23 April 1901:
Following his return to Canada, Holland became a commissioned officer. During the visit to Canada of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, Holland received the Victoria Cross from the Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V) in Ottawa on 21 September 1901.

Holland eventually achieved the rank of Major and served in World War I with the Canadian Machine Gun Corps. He commanded and actively recruited for the Borden&#x27;s Machine Gun Battery in Cobalt, Ontario and the surrounding Temiskaming District.

From an article in New Liskeard Speaker, Friday, 15 January 1915 - Off to the Front
 &quot;Temiskaming friends of Major &quot;Eddie&quot; Holland will be interested in knowing that he is making all arrangements for the proper filling up of vacancies in the &quot;Borden Armoured Light Battery&quot;, which will be sent to the front to aid the Allies just as quickly as all plans can be made. Major Holland, who is a veteran of the Boer War, where he received the V.C. for gallant service, is in Temiskaming this week, where he is recruiting a number of men with whose ability to rough it he is already well acquainted. Major Holland has come to the right quarter for the men he most desires to enlist. No where but in a mining region; where the prospector and miner is hardened to the severest kind of work, could he secure men fit to take to the road in as short a space of time as can the chaps he is after, and we are sure he will find that the difficult part of his job will be to select the best men from the large numbers who will want to enlist under the command of the genial Major. 
 &quot;Speaking of the equipment over which the Major will have command, the Nugget says:&quot; 
 &quot;&quot;Major Holland, V.C., will have seven armoured cars, one semi-armoured car, six motor-cycles, machine shop and ammunition and transport car in his equipment. He has 60 men under his command and the majority of these men are all well known in Temiskaming, having been prospectors at various times in the north. Four men and one officer are attached to each car&quot;.&quot;
 &quot;Following are the names of the men recruited by Major E.J. Holland for service in the Automobile Battery being and outfitted by Sir George Drummond and other Montreal gentlemen. All the men named below are residents of New Ontario.&quot;
 &quot;Major E.J. Holland, Capt. B. McCarthy, Lieut. J.H. Rattery, Lieut. W. Patterson, Sergt.-Major E.H. Holland, I.H. Holland, F.B. Reece, W.H. Bruce, E.D. Carrier, H.W. Mauce, Reg. Moore, Sandy McIntyre, Doc Dowsley, Dave Moore, W. Mayor, T. Rogers, I.J.P. Morgan, J. Kennedy, Dan MacRae, D. Kipper, W. Maudley, Joe McDonald, Pete McDonald, O.J. Leeman, B.E. Sorpos, E. Moore, J. Oswald, F. Kennedy, Geo. Scott, M. Montgomery, J. Brennon, D. Saltrold, L. Coyne, Geo. M. Scott, A. Fraser, W. Taylor, A. Brady, A. McEcheram, J. Sullivan, A. Close, C. Ross.&quot;

==Later life==
Holland died on 18 June 1948 in Cobalt, Ontario, a town at the south end of Lake Temiskaming and former centre of the silver-mining industry in Canada.
He was cremated at St James&#x27;s Crematorium, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Ashes were scattered Island 17, Lake Temagami and at Prescott, Ontario, Canada (south of Ottawa, Ontario).

==Honours==
*His Victoria Cross is currently stored as part of the Archives and Collection of the Royal Canadian Dragoons at CFB Petawawa.
*A plaque erected in 1969 at Trafalgar House on Argyle Street in Ottawa and dedicated to Holland relates the story of how he earned his VC.
*A brass plaque and print were erected in 1986 at his alma mater, Lisgar Collegiate Institute, by students and alumni in 1986 in remembrance of his bravery at Leliefontein.
*The Canadian Department of National Defence named an armoury in Ottawa the Major E.J.G. Holland VC Armoury. It is home to four local reserve units: 33 Signals Regiment, 33 Combat Engineer Regiment, 33 Service Battalion, and 33 Military Police Platoon.

<doc id="1223094" wikidata="Q844813" url="?curid=1223094" title="Torre Mayor">
<text>The Torre Mayor is an office skyscraper in Mexico City, Mexico that is the eighth tallest building in Mexico with a height of 225 meters (738 feet). From its completion in 2003 until 2010, it was the tallest building in Latin America; it was surpassed by the 236 m (774 ft) high Ocean Two in Panama City, Panama. The Torre Mayor was developed by Canadian businessman Paul Reichmann, who also maintained part ownership until his death in 2013. It is also part-owned by a group of institutional investors. The building was designed by the architectural firms of Zeidler Partnership Architects and Executive Architects Adamson Associates Architects, both of Toronto. The structural engineers and designers were The Cantor Seinuk Group from New York City in association with Enrique Martínez Romero S.A. in Mexico City.

Located on Paseo de la Reforma in Cuauhtémoc, it was built by Canadian-owned Reichmann International on the former location of the Cine Chapultepec. Construction work began in 1999 and was finished in late 2003. Due to Mexico City&#x27;s high propensity to earthquakes, the tower incorporates several anti-earthquake measures. Torre Mayor is one of the strongest buildings on Earth in terms of earthquake resistance, being designed to withstand earthquakes measuring 8.5 on the Richter Scale.

==Earthquake resistance==
The Torre Mayor stands in the lakebed area where most of the 1985 earthquake damage occurred. It was built with 96 dampers, which work like car shock absorbers to block the resonating effect of the lakebed and its own height. These diamond-shaped dampers are seen architecturally on its perimeter. With this extra bracing, this tower can withstand earthquake forces nearly four times as efficiently as a conventionally damped building. The dampening system proved its worth in January 2003, as a 7.6 earthquake shook the city. Not only did the building survive undamaged, occupants inside at the time did not know a tremor had occurred.

==Description==
The tower has 30,000 m² of glass on the south facade with thermal and acoustic insulation, plus finished marble inside and granite in common areas and hallways. The architecture of the building is contemporary and international quality. It also has three electric power supplies in average voltage, and it is noteworthy that it is the only building in Latin America that feeds energy from three different points of the city.
It has 29 passenger elevators, which reach a top speed of 6.7 m/s.
It was built at an average of 4 floors per week, and no workers died during its construction, and thus has the record for being the only skyscraper in the world that has not had any major accidents or deaths during construction.
It received LEED certification in 2013. It uses solar energy.

==Intelligent building==

Torre Mayor&#x27;s elevators have a seismic detector that detects any movement of earth and therefore automatically stops the elevator nearest to allow passengers to get off. The Torre Mayor is administered by the Building Management System (BMS), an intelligent system that controls all facilities and equipment harmoniously and efficiently to protect human life from danger. The integrated system has the ability to control elevators, fire protection and lighting in the building. The floors&#x27; underground injection machines have fans and fresh air exchange to prevent excessive concentration of pollutants entering the building. It was the first building in Mexico that met the now-mandatory standard for energy efficiency of nonresidential buildings (NOM-008) and it has an automatic water saver, which is one of the first to be used in Mexico City.

Lieutenant CJW Grant of the Madras Staff Corps with a detachment of eighty Punjabi and Gurkha soldiers was stationed at the border post of Tamu, some 55 miles from Manipur. On hearing about the incident on 28 March, he immediately marched with his detachment for relief of the survivors. On 31 March, he arrived at Thoubal about 15 miles from Imphal and immediately attacked and captured the village. He then proceeded to entrench his force. Next day, the Manipuris advanced towards Thoubal in force. Without waiting for the enemy to attack, Lieutenant Grant with forty men went out to meet them and forming up, opened fire. For the next nine days, the intrepid young officer and his gallant men repulsed repeated attacks. Always keeping the initiative, and surprising the Manipuris with sallies, he inflicted heavy casualties and thoroughly demoralized them. Several offers of truce and safe passage were spurned by him. On 9 April, he received orders to withdraw towards a British force, which was then advancing towards Manipur. Eighty men had defied the entire army of a state for more than a week, losing just one man killed and four wounded, including Lieutenant Grant. The lieutenant and his men joined the relieving force and took further part in fighting during which he was again wounded. The British entered Imphal (Kangla) on 26 April, bringing an end to the war. For his conspicuous bravery, inspirational leadership and devotion to duty, Lieutenant Charles Grant was awarded the Victoria Cross.

His citation in the London Gazette reads:

He later achieved the rank of brevet colonel and commanded the 89th and 92nd Punjabis (now 1st &amp; 4th Battalions The Baloch Regiment, Pakistan Army). He retired in 1911 and returned to England. He rejoined the army during the First World War, acting as a draft conducting officer. He lived in Sidmouth, Devon, where he died in 1932, aged 71.

On 24 June 2021, it was reported that Grant&#x27;s VC was sold at auction along with other historically important items to an unnamed bidder for £420,000.

<text>The BR Standard steam locomotives were an effort to standardise locomotives from the motley collection of older pre-grouping locos. Construction started in 1951. Due to the controversial British Railways&#x27; modernisation plan of 1955, where steam traction was abandoned in 
favour of diesel and electric traction, many of the locomotives&#x27; working lives were very short: between 7 and 17 years. Many have been preserved, mainly due to being sent to Barry Scrapyard.

== Ex-WD Austerity engines ==

The first BR standards were the BR ex-WD Austerity 2-8-0 and BR ex-WD Austerity 2-10-0s. They were given the numbers 90000-732 and 90750-774 respectively. They were assigned the boiler types BR10 and BR11, and both had the tender type BR5.

== Background ==

Robert Riddles put his case for continuing to build steam locomotives in his presidential address to the Institution of Locomotive Engineers in November 1950. He compared capital costs to show that steam was cheaper than the alternatives, though he did not mention productivity differences, except to say fuel costs did not rank very high relative to total costs. For example, a Class 5 cost £16,000, compared to £78,100 for a 1,600 h. p. diesel, £138,700 for a gas turbine, or £37,400 for electric. He calculated the costs per drawbar horse power as £13 6s (steam), £65 (diesel), £69 7s (turbine) and £17 13s (electric). Riddles retired in 1953.

=== Design ===
From 1951, BR started to build steam locomotives to its own standard designs, which were largely based on LMS practice but incorporating ideas and modifications from the other constituent companies, continental Europe and North America. Their design was overseen by Riddles.

Characteristic features were taper boilers, high running plates, two cylinders and streamlined cabs.

== Construction ==

Although more were ordered, 999 BR &quot;Standards&quot; were constructed: the last, 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;, was built in 1960. Most never achieved their potential service life and were withdrawn in working order.

Construction was split between the ex-LMS works at Crewe, Derby and Horwich, the ex-LNER works at Darlington and Doncaster, the ex-GWR works at Swindon, and the ex-SR works at Brighton.


== Tenders ==

The tenders used with the Standard locomotives were also new designs. There were different types due to the use of different coal-to-water ratios, weight restrictions and later improved designs. It was standard practice for there to be fewer tenders than locomotives, as tenders took little time to overhaul compared to locomotives, locomotives entering works for overhaul would tend to lose their tenders to locomotives leaving works after overhaul.


== Preservation ==

A total of 46 standards have survived - of these, 38 were rescued from Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Wales. The BR Standard Locomotive Owner&#x27;s Group provides co-ordination.

=== New Builds ===

The new build of the &#x27;Clan&#x27; class 72010 “Hengist” is progressing steadily.
The new build of the Class 3 Tank 82045 is well underway, work continues as of 2021.

<text>John Lynn VC DCM (a.k.a. Jackie Lynn) (1887 – 3 May 1915) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 27 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 2 May 1915 near Ypres, Belgium, when the Germans were advancing behind their wave of asphyxiating gas, Private Lynn, although almost overcome by the deadly fumes, handled his machine-gun with great effect against the enemy, and when he could not see them, he moved his gun higher up the parapet so that he could fire more effectively. This eventually checked any further advance and the outstanding courage displayed by this soldier had a great effect upon his comrades in the very trying circumstances. Private Lynn died the next day from the effects of gas poisoning.

Lynn was also awarded the Cross of the Order of St. George, 4th Class (Russia).

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Fusilier Museum, Bury, Greater Manchester.
John Lynn&#x27;s original grave (now lost) was in Vlamertinghe Churchyard. A memorial headstone is in Grootebeek British Cemetery, bearing the inscription: .

<text>Artur or Arthur Văitoianu (14 April 1864 in Izmail – 17 June 1956) was a Romanian general who served as a Prime Minister of Romania for about two months in 1919 (27 September – 30 November). During his mandate, the first elections of Greater Romania were held.

==Career==
He was born in Izmail, then part of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. His father, Teodor Weithoffer Văitoianu, was a Bessarabian German, while his mother, Maria Missir, was Romanian. He rose through the ranks of the Romanian Army and, during the World War I Battle of Mărăști, he commanded the Second Corps.

Earlier in the War, during the Romanian Campaign of 1916, he commanded the 10th Infantry Division at the Battle of Predeal Pass, in defense of Prahova Valley. He managed to block the Central Powers from reaching Bucharest via the shortest way, thus preventing them from cutting off and surrounding the Romanian Army and by implication knock the country out of the war. It was a decisive victory that enabled Romania to wage war until 1918, when it had to surrender after Russia did the same, leaving Romania alone on the Eastern Front and surrounded by the Central Powers, a situation that far surpassed its military capacities.

A War and Interior Minister in Ion I. C. Brătianu&#x27;s cabinet, he came to lead the executive upon the latter&#x27;s resignation over the Allied Powers&#x27; refusal to recognize the territorial awards promised to Romania upon its 1916 entry into the conflict (on the basis of Romania having signed a separate peace with the Central Powers, the Treaty of Bucharest, in the previous year); in the short hiatus, no Romanian authority was present at the signing of the Treaty of Saint-Germain with Austria.

Văitoianu took office as Romanian troops were engaged in an expedition to Hungary, where they were fighting against the newly proclaimed Hungarian Soviet Republic. The Supreme War Council of Allied Powers gave Romania an 8-day ultimatum to retreat its troops from Budapest to the provisional border settled by the Paris Peace Conference and to cease confiscation of Hungarian property, as well as to sign the peace with Austria and agree to guarantee minority rights throughout Greater Romania. Văitoianu&#x27;s government refused to comply, and handed in its resignation on 30 November, leaving room for the bloc formed in Parliament by the Romanian National Party of Transylvania and the Peasants&#x27; Party of the Regat to form the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod cabinet, one which soon agreed to the Allies&#x27; demands.

He was a high-ranking member of the National Liberal Party-Brătianu for much of his political career.

Artur Văitoianu was buried in the World War I heroes&#x27; crypt in Mărăști. In 2007, the local authorities claimed that Văitoianu&#x27;s and Averescu&#x27;s remains were stolen from their crypts, asking for the Prosecution Office to investigate.

<doc id="1223120" wikidata="Q2661641" url="?curid=1223120" title="Johan Skytte">
<text>Johan Skytte (1577, in Nyköping – 15 March 1645, in Söderåkra, Sweden) was a Swedish , and the founder of the &quot;Academia Gustaviana&quot; (today&#x27;s University of Tartu in Estonia), in 1632.

He was a son of the mayor of Nyköping, Bengt Nilsson Skräddare, and Anna Andersdotter. While attending school in his hometown and for the nine years he was studying at foreign universities, he used the surname Schroderus, a Latinized derivation from his paternal German surname &quot;Schröder&quot;, as did also his elder brother, Ericus Schroderus (&quot;Erik Benedict Schröder&quot;) (c. 1575 – summer of 1647), a publisher, translator and pioneer on the written standard Swedish language.

In 1602, at his return from his foreign studies, Skytte was hired as tutor for the seven years old Prince Gustavus Adolphus, the future king who reigned in 1611–1632 and is credited for turning the kingdom into a &quot;Great Power&quot;, and founding the Swedish Empire (1611–1721).

In 1603, Skytte was ennobled, and acquired the family-name &quot;Skytte&quot;, after an extinct noble family from which he claimed descent on his maternal side. His noble family members have used the family-names &quot;Skytte af Duderhof&quot; (also: &quot;Duderhoff&quot;), &quot;Skytte af Sätra&quot;, and &quot;Skytte&quot;, and some also &quot;Scott&quot; in Canada and the United States. In 1607–1611, Skytte had the Grönsö Castle (old spelling: &quot;Grönsöö&quot;) built for his personal use. It is located on the island of Grönsö in Enköping, Sweden.

In 1610, Skytte was sent to London on a diplomatic mission, an attempt to seek the hand of Elizabeth Stuart, the daughter of James I, the &quot;King of Scots, England and Ireland&quot;, for the young prince Gustavus. In 1611, Skytte became the Governor of Vestmannia, and in 1612 the head of Sweden&#x27;s tax authority.

In 1617, he became a State Judge (&quot;kammarråd&quot;) and High Councillor (&quot;riksråd&quot;), and participated in the drafting of the 1617 Coronation Oath of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (a.k.a. &quot;Gustav II Adolf, Gustav II Adolph&quot;). As High Councillor, Skytte was a member of the Privy Council of Sweden. It was a cabinet of medieval origin, consisting of magnates () who advised and – at times – co-ruled the realm with the King of Sweden.

In 1620, Skytte&#x27;s long-time friend and most important ally, King Gustavus Adolphus, was married to Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg. The queen consort of Sweden bore her husband a daughter, Christina, in 1626.

In 1622, Skytte was appointed Chancellor of Uppsala University, which he remained until his death, and made plans for the launching of a new appellate court in the city of Tartu (Swedish: &quot;Dorpat&quot;) in Swedish Livonia in what is now Estonia. Also in 1622, Skytte endowed the &quot;Skyttean Professorship of Eloquence and Government&quot; to the Uppsala University. He prescribed in detail how the chair-holder should carry out his teaching. The Skytte Chair is considered the oldest professorship in political science in the world. Skytte&#x27;s own house in Uppsala, the originally medieval building known as &quot;Skytteanum&quot;, is still today used by Sweden&#x27;s Department of Government; the &quot;Professor Skytteanus&quot; has their residence in an apartment in the building. Since 1995, the Skytte Foundation at Uppsala University has awarded an annual Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science).

Of the several schools in Sweden named after Skytte, one was actually founded on his initiative, the Skyttean school (&quot;Skytteanska skolan&quot;), established in 1631 in Lycksele, and moved to Tärnaby in 1867 – both places are in the northern Swedish province of Lapland. To commemorate Skytte&#x27;s contribution to the education in northern Sweden, the Royal Skyttean Society was established and named after him in 1956 in Umeå. 

By 1624, Skytte&#x27;s job-titles had come to include the Chief Justice of Finland when – that year – he was created baron (&quot;friherre&quot;) and was granted the Barony of Tuutari (&quot;Dudern&quot;) in Ingria. 

In 1629, Skytte was appointed Governor-General of Swedish Livonia, Ingria and Karelia for the period of 1629–1634. In 1632, he was appointed chancellor of the &quot;Academia Gustaviana&quot; (today&#x27;s University of Tartu), which he founded that year, with the required ratification provided by King Gustavus Adolphus, briefly before the king&#x27;s death on 6 November 1632 in the Battle of Lützen (1632), during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648).

The dead King Adolphus&#x27; body was brought to Nyköping, and kept there until the funeral ceremony held in the summer of 1634 at the Nyköping Castle, where Skytte gave a speech, and Bishop Johannes Rudbeckius read a sermon dedicated to the king&#x27;s daughter, Christina, Queen of Sweden. After this, the king&#x27;s remains were moved to the capital city Stockholm. Also in 1634, Skytte founded – and became the first president of – the Göta Court of Appeal in Jönköping. 

Johan Skytte was parent to Vendela Skytte and Bengt Skytte, and brother to Lars Bengtsson Skytte, a &quot;stadtholder&quot; of the Swedish Empire, and a distant forefather of the president of Finland, marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (1867–1961).

<text>Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488 (1961), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court reaffirmed that the United States Constitution prohibits states and the federal government from requiring any kind of religious test for public office, in this case as a notary public.

==Background==
In the early 1960s, the Governor of Maryland appointed Roy Torcaso (November 13, 1910 – June 9, 2007) as a notary public. At the time, the Constitution of Maryland required &quot;a declaration of belief in the existence of God&quot; for a person to hold &quot;any office of profit or trust in this State&quot;.

Torcaso, an atheist, refused to make such a statement, and his appointment was consequently revoked. Torcaso, believing his constitutional rights to freedom of religious expression had been infringed, filed suit in a Maryland Circuit Court. The Circuit Court rejected his claim, and the Maryland Court of Appeals held that the requirement in the Maryland Constitution for a declaration of belief in God as a qualification for office was self-executing and did not require any implementing legislation to be enacted by the state legislature.

The Court of Appeals justified its decision thus:

Torcaso took the matter to the United States Supreme Court, which heard oral argument on April 24, 1961.

==Decision==

The Court unanimously found that Maryland&#x27;s requirement for a person holding public office to state a belief in God violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

The Court had established in &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; (1947) that:

Writing for the Court in &quot;Torcaso&quot;, Justice Hugo Black cited &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; and applied the &quot;Everson&quot; holding:

Rebuffing the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals, Justice Black added: &quot;The fact, however, that a person is not compelled to hold public office cannot possibly be an excuse for barring him from office by state-imposed criteria forbidden by the Constitution.&quot;

The Court did not base its holding on the no religious test clause of Article VI. In Footnote 1 of the opinion, Justice Black wrote:

==Secular humanism as a religion==

Some religious groups have argued that in &quot;Torcaso&quot; the Supreme Court &quot;found&quot; secular humanism to be a religion. This assertion is based on a reference, by Justice Black in footnote 11 of the Court&#x27;s opinion, to court cases where organized groups of self-identified humanists, or ethicists, meeting on a regular basis to share and celebrate their beliefs, were granted religious-based tax exemptions. Religious groups such as those supporting causes such as teaching creationism in schools have seized upon Justice Black&#x27;s use of the term &quot;secular humanism&quot; in his footnote as a &quot;finding&quot; that any secular or evolution-based activity is a religion under US law.

<text>Samuel Frickleton, (1 April 1891 – 1 September 1971) was a soldier in the New Zealand Military Forces and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award of the British Commonwealth for gallantry in the face of the enemy.

Born in 1891 in Scotland, Frickleton moved to New Zealand in 1913 and was a miner when he enlisted with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) the year after the outbreak of the First World War. He took ill on reaching the Middle East and had to be repatriated to New Zealand. Although he had been discharged from the NZEF, he rejoined after recovering his health. He was posted to the 3rd Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade, then serving on the Western Front. Wounded during the Battle of Messines when he destroyed two machine gun posts, an action that earned him the VC, he received medical treatment in England. He then underwent officer training but his health was still poor and before the end of the war he was returned to New Zealand.

Post war, Frickleton served in the New Zealand Staff Corps before returning to civilian life in 1927. He tried farming and worked as a house manager. In the mid-1930s, Frickleton joined the part time Territorial Force and would be later awarded the Efficiency Decoration (ED). He went to London in 1937 for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and again nearly 20 years later for the VC centenary. He served on the home front during the Second World War, and eventually retired from the military in 1948. He died in 1971 at the age of 80.

==Early life==
Frickleton was born on 1 April 1891 in Slamannan, Scotland, one of 11 children born to Samuel Frickleton, a coal miner, and his wife Elizabeth. Following the death of his father, he immigrated to New Zealand in 1913, with his mother and several of her children, to join an older brother who was living in Blackball on the West Coast. He and four of his brothers all worked in a mine in the town, extracting coal.

== First World War ==

Following the outbreak of the First World War, Frickleton joined the New Zealand Military Forces in February 1915 and volunteered to serve overseas with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). His four brothers had also volunteered for the NZEF.

Frickleton embarked for the Middle East with the 5th Reinforcements with the rank of corporal in the Canterbury Battalion. After arriving in Egypt in June, he became ill with tuberculosis, was repatriated to New Zealand and subsequently discharged from the NZEF as medically unfit for active service. After a period of convalescence at a medical facility near Dunedin, he re-enlisted in the NZEF in 1916 and sent to England with the 15th Reinforcements. Initially a rifleman (equivalent to a private), later that year he was posted to France to join the 3rd Battalion, New Zealand Rifle Brigade. By March 1917, he had been promoted to corporal.

On 7 June 1917, Frickleton participated in the Battle of Messines. His battalion, covered by artillery fire, was attacking the edge of the village of Messines, now known as Mesen, when it was slowed by two machine gun posts. Frickleton, wounded in the arm, led his section in an attack on the machine gun posts. With the barrage of artillery concealing their approach, he threw a grenade that destroyed one machine gun and rushed forward with a bayonet to deal with the survivors of its crew. He similarly dealt with the other machine gun, making a solo attack under the covering gunfire of his section. He continued to remain involved in the fighting in Messines until being wounded again, this time in the hip. He also was badly gassed which, with his wounds, saw him taken from the battlefield for treatment.

Frickleton was awarded a Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions in dealing with the machine gun posts in Messines. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Frickleton&#x27;s award read as follows:
Evacuated to England for medical treatment, Frickleton&#x27;s wounds would affect his health for the remainder of his life. He was presented with his VC by King George V on 17 September 1917, in a ceremony at Glasgow. By then he was an acting sergeant, which was confirmed later that year. After a period of further hospitalisation, he was selected for and underwent officer training. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in March 1918 and returned to the Rifle Brigade. However, his health problems persisted and he again was repatriated to New Zealand in June 1918.

The first of the VC recipients of the NZEF to return to New Zealand, Frickleton was accorded a hero&#x27;s welcome. A reception was held in Frickleton&#x27;s honour at the Auckland Town Hall. He spent the remainder of the year under medical care before being discharged from the NZEF in December 1918. Of his brothers who also served in the war, one was killed in the Battle of the Somme, and three others were wounded.

==Later life==
After the war, Frickleton transferred to the New Zealand Staff Corps. He was promoted to acting lieutenant and served as assistant provost marshal for the Wellington Military District for several months until June 1919. He was then transferred to the Canterbury Military District. For health reasons, he retired from the military with the rank of captain in April 1927.

In civilian life he tried several professions. At first, he took up business in Wellington and then tried farming at Waikanae. He later worked as a house manager. His poor health notwithstanding, in 1934 he joined the Territorial Force with the rank of captain. He was later awarded the Efficiency Decoration (ED) for his long service in the military. He was part of the New Zealand contingent sent to London in 1937 for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. He was returned to the Officer Reserve the same year. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Frickleton was unsuccessful in his attempt to enlist in the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force being raised for overseas service. Instead he served on the home front as Inspector, New Zealand Military Forces, for the duration of the war. He was returned to the Retired List in 1948. 
In his later years, Frickleton worked for the Colonial Motor Company as a clerk. In 1956, he was one of 400 VC winners who paraded in Hyde Park in London for the VC centenary. He died on 1 September 1971 in Wellington after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, Valeska whom he married in 1922, and a son. He is buried in the Taita Serviceman&#x27;s Cemetery, Naenae.

==Medals==
In 1977, Frickleton&#x27;s wife donated his VC and other medals which in addition to the ED, included the 1914-15 Star, the British War Medal, the Victory Medal, the King George VI Coronation Medal, and the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal, to the National Army Museum in Waiouru. The VC was on display when it was one of nine Victoria Crosses that were among a hundred medals stolen from the museum in December 2007. On 16 February 2008, New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of a NZ$300,000 reward offered by Michael Ashcroft and Tom Sturgess.

==Legacy==
There are several memorials to his memory; a plaque commemorating his bravery was unveiled on 7 June 2007 at the Mesen Church in Belgium in a ceremony attended by two of his granddaughters. There is also a plaque in his honour at the Messines Ridge British Cemetery and a memorial cairn in Slamannan, his place of birth. In 2010, a barracks at Burnham Military Camp was named for him.

<text>The Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science () was established in 1995 by the Johan Skytte Foundation at Uppsala University. The foundation itself goes back to the donation in 1622 from Johan Skytte (1577–1645), politician and chancellor of the university, which established the Skyttean professorship of Eloquence and Government.

The prize, 500,000 Swedish kronor (approximately $52,000) is to be given &quot;to the scholar who in the view of the Foundation has made the most valuable contribution to political science&quot;. Since its creation in 1995, the Johan Skytte Prize has garnered a prestigious reputation within the social science community, earning the nickname &quot;the Nobel Prize for Political Science.&quot; According to reputation surveys conducted in 2013–2014 and 2018, it is the most prestigious international academic award in political science.

<text>Major Stewart Walter Loudoun-Shand VC (8 October 1879 – 1 July 1916) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions during an attack near the French village of Fricourt on the opening day of the Battle of the Somme.

==Early life==
Stewart Walter Shand was born on 8 October 1879 in Ceylon, and was one of ten children of John Shand, a tea planter, and his wife Lucy . Both his parents were originally from Scotland. The family, wealthy from trading in tea, later moved to South London. They lived in Dulwich, where all the boys of the family attended Dulwich College. Stewart excelled at sport, especially cricket. His brother, Eric, later represented Scotland in Rugby union.

==South Africa==
Shand was working at a bank when the Second Boer War broke out in South Africa in 1899. He volunteered for the British Army&#x27;s London Scottish Regiment but was not considered for service in South Africa on account of his age. He transferred to the Pembroke Yeomanry and was posted to its 9th Battalion, and with them was able to participate in the war. Having attained the rank of lance corporal, his service ended in 1901 but he remained in South Africa, working for a merchant company at Port Elizabeth. He left after a few years to take up a position in Ceylon, his place of birth, as a tea merchant; his father was instrumental in securing him the role.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, Loudoun-Shand, as he was now known following the change by deed poll of his family name, travelled to England to volunteer for service with the British Army. He was commissioned as a lieutenant and posted to the 10th Battalion of The Yorkshire Regiment. He spent the next several months training in the Surrey region with the battalion and, in June 1915, was promoted to captain.

The 10th Battalion arrived on the Western Front in September 1915, as part of the 62nd Brigade, 21st Division. Shortly afterwards, it fought in the Battle of Loos. Casualties in the battalion as the result of its role in the battle were such that in December, Loudoun-Shand was promoted to temporary major and given command of a company. He was wounded the following March but was only out of the frontline for a few days.

For 1 July 1916, the opening day of the Battle of the Somme, the 62nd Brigade was tasked with securing the area around the village of Fricourt, held by the Germans. Loudoun-Shand&#x27;s company was part of a second wave of attacks that followed the initial assault that commenced at 7:30 am. In the face of heavy machine gun fire, his men were reluctant to advance from their trenches. To encourage them forward, he leapt on the parapet of the trench and despite the danger from machine gun fire, urged and encouraged his men forward. He was soon wounded but remained in the frontline and continued to urge his men forward until he died of his wounds. For his actions, he was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation reads as follows:
Casualties were high amongst Loudoun-Shand&#x27;s company, and by the conclusion of the day, 94 of the 122 men who commenced the attack had been wounded or killed.

Loudoun-Shand is buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission&#x27;s Norfolk Cemetery at Becordel-Becourt, near the Somme. His name is among those listed on the Dulwich College War Memorial and is on the Loudoun-Shand memorial at the West Norwood Cemetery.

==Medals==
Loudoun-Shand&#x27;s VC was presented to his father by King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 31 March 1917. The VC, along with his service medals from the First World War and the Second Boer War, were retained in his family for some time until purchased by Lord Ashcroft in 2005. They are displayed in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Monar is a Polish non-governmental organization focused on helping drug addicts, the homeless, those who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, and many other groups of people who need help. It was established formally as an association in 1981.

The origins of Monar lie in the centre which was opened on 15 October 1978 in Gloskow near Garwolin, by Marek Kotański. He and several other volunteers rebuilt an abandoned house in ruins.

The organisation maintains 30 stationary centres of rehabilitation, and 28 points of &quot;temporary help&quot; for drug and alcohol addicts. It also maintains 70 hostels for homeless people and 13 points of information trying to prevent AIDS, drug addiction, helping parents etc.

The organisation employs around 700 professionals (medical staff, psychologists etc.) and it is supported by around 300 volunteers each year. Around 2,000 drug and alcohol addicts are recovered each year. Around 20,000 homeless people are using Monar hostels.

<doc id="1223136" wikidata="Q2321140" url="?curid=1223136" title="Simão Rodrigues">
<text>Simão Rodrigues de Azevedo, SJ (1510 – 15 June 1579), also known in English as Simon Rodericks, was a Portuguese Catholic priest and one of the co-founders of the Society of Jesus.

A Portuguese nobleman, Rodrigues was one of the six very first companions of Ignatius of Loyola at the University of Paris who took vows of poverty and chastity at the chapel of Montmartre, on the 15 August 1534. The group of &#x27;Friends in the Lord&#x27; will ultimately form the nucleus of the Society of Jesus, approved in 1540 (in &quot;Regimini militantis ecclesiae&quot;).

After some years working under the direction of Ignatius in Italy, he was sent to Portugal, where his strong personality immediately attracted many young men to the Society and he became very influential at the royal court. Unfortunately, as the Provincial of the Portuguese Jesuits he allowed certain spiritual devotions to develop into extreme ascetical practices, and thus cause public scandal (night-time public calls to penance, with self-flagellation, in the streets of Coimbra). Several letters of Ignatius, calling to restrain and obedience, fell on deaf ears. The province was in two minds as many Jesuits admired and respected him. Complaints were made and Rodrigues was recalled.

Dragging his feet he finally reached Rome where, at his own request, he was tried (1544). His three Jesuit judges found him guilty of &#x27;excesses and lack of obedience&#x27;. All penances were lifted by Ignatius except that he was not allowed to return to Portugal. He was assigned to other duties in Italy and, later, Spain. Rodrigues was recalcitrant and for several years sought to overthrow the decision against him, but his appeals to friends he had made in high places were unsuccessful.

Eventually, he gave up these attempts and returned to obedience. As an old man, he was allowed to go back to his native country, where, before dying, he wrote a history of the early years of the Society.

<text>Vasili IV Ivanovich Shuisky (, 12 September 1612) was Tsar of all Russia from 1606 to 1610, after the murder of False Dmitri I. His rule coincided with the Time of Troubles. He was the only member of House of Shuisky to become tsar and the last member of the Rurikid dynasty (Yurievichi branch) to rule as tsar.

==Life==
He was a son of Ivan Andreyevich Shuisky. Born Prince Vasili Ivanovich Shuisky, he descended from the Yurievichi sovereign princes of Nizhny Novgorod, and was allegedly a 20th-generation male-line descendant of the 9th-century Varangian prince Rurik. Vasili Ivanovich was one of the leading boyars of the Tsardom of Russia during the reigns of Feodor I () and Boris Godunov (). In the court intrigues of the Time of Troubles (1598–1613), Vasily and his younger brother Dmitry Shuisky usually acted together and fought as one.

It was Shuisky who, in obedience to the secret orders of tsar-to-be Boris, went to Uglich to inquire into the cause of the death of the Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich (the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible ()), who had perished there in mysterious circumstances in May 1591. Shuisky reported that it was a case of suicide, though rumors abounded that the Tsarevich had been assassinated on the orders of the regent Boris Godunov. Some suspected that Dmitry escaped the assassination and that another boy was killed in his place – this story provided impetus for the repeated emergence of impostors such as False Dmitry I, False Dmitry II, and False Dmitry III. On the death of Boris, who had become tsar, and the accession of Boris&#x27;s son Feodor II in 1605, Shuisky went back upon his own words in order to gain favour with the pretender False Dmitriy I, who was attempting to gain the throne by impersonating the dead Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich. Shuisky recognized the pretender as the &quot;real&quot; Dmitry, despite having earlier determined that the boy had committed suicide. Soon afterwards the young Tsar Feodor fell victim to an assassination.

Shuisky then turned against the false Dmitry and brought about his death (in May 1606) by stating that the real Dmitry had indeed been slain and that the reigning tsar Dmitriy (False Dmitriy I) was an impostor. After Dmitriy&#x27;s death, Shuisky&#x27;s adherents proclaimed him tsar, on 19 May 1606. He reigned until 19 July 1610, but was never generally recognized. Even in Moscow itself he had little or no authority, and he only avoided deposition by the dominant boyars because they had no one to replace him with.

The popularity of Vasili Shuisky&#x27;s cousin, Prince Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky, who commanded an army aided by an allied Swedish force led by Jacob de la Gardie, allowed Shuisky, for a time, to remain on his unstable throne. In 1610 the Seven Boyars, notably his former adherents Princes and Fedor Ivanovich Mstislavsky, deposed him. He was forcibly made a monk and eventually transported together with his two brothers to Warsaw by the Polish hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski. He died a prisoner in the castle of Gostynin, near Warsaw, in 1612, followed soon after by his brother Dmitry. The Romanovs, elected as rulers of Russia in 1613, recognized Vasili posthumously as a legal tsar, and during their negotiations with the Polish authorities constantly demanded the right to rebury his body in Russia. Following the Treaty of Polyanovka in 1635, Vasili&#x27;s remains were finally returned to Moscow and laid to rest in the Archangel Cathedral.

==Marriages and issue==

Vasili Shuisky was married twice. His first wife, Elena Mikhailovna Repnina, died prior his election to tsardom, and he had no children from that marriage. After his coronation, Vasili married Princess Ekaterina Buynosova-Rostovskaya, whose name was changed to Maria, deemed more suitable for a tsarina consort. They had two daughters together, princesses Anna and Anastasia, but both died in infancy during their father&#x27;s reign, and were buried in the Old Maiden&#x27;s Convent in Kremlin. As both brothers of Vasili, princes Dmitri Shuisky and Ivan Shuisky the Button, died also childless, the Shuiskys&#x27; princely house became extinct after the death of the latter in 1638.

==In literature==
The future Tsar Vasili IV serves as a character in Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s blank verse drama &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera of the same name. In both depictions, the character is an adviser to Boris Godunov and a master of palace intrigue. Despite being fully aware that Tsar Boris ordered the assassination of the child Tsarevich Dmitriy, Vasili Shuisky remains outwardly loyal, only switching his support to the Pretender when the latter appears likely to win. Pushkin later described his intention to write further plays about the Time of Troubles.

<text>Gheorghe G. Mironescu, commonly known as G. G. Mironescu (January 28, 1874 – October 8, 1949), was a Romanian politician, member of the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ), who served as Prime Minister of Romania for two terms.

==Biography==
Born in Vaslui, Mironescu graduated from the University of Bucharest&#x27;s law faculty in 1894 and from its literature and philosophy faculty the following year. In 1898, he earned a doctorate in law from the Faculty of Law of Paris (University of Paris). In 1900, he was named prosecutor at the Ilfov County tribunal, and served as state&#x27;s attorney from 1900 to 1901. He was a professor of law at his alma mater from 1903 to 1939, and in 1938 was elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy. Initially joining the Conservative Party, he switched to Take Ionescu&#x27;s new Conservative-Democratic Party in 1908. An advocate of Romania&#x27;s entering World War I on the side of the Allies, he was in Paris from 1917 to 1918, writing editorials in the French press and particularly in &quot;La Roumanie&quot;. In late 1922, he entered the Romanian National Party, which became the PNȚ in 1926. Elected to the Assembly of Deputies in 1911, he became a Senator in 1914.

His first stint in government was in Ionescu&#x27;s cabinet, from December 1921 until the following month, when he served as Education Minister. After 1926, he became one of the most recognizable PNȚ leaders, the main figure of a pro-authoritarian faction bitterly opposed to left-wing groups such as those of Nicolae L. Lupu, Petre Andrei, Mihai Ralea, and Armand Călinescu. From November 1928 to October 1930, he served as Foreign Minister in Iuliu Maniu&#x27;s first two cabinets. As such, he participated in the two Hague conferences on reparations, and backed Aristide Briand&#x27;s proposal for a Federal Europe.

In 1930, Carol II of Romania returned to Romania (with a fake passport). On the morning of June 7, 1930, the Government convened Parliament in order to cancel the act of January 4, 1926, through which Carol had renounced the throne. Carol was proclaimed the new King of Romania, replacing his own son Michael. Maniu resigned, and a new PNȚ government was formed, under the leadership of Gheorghe Mironescu, restoring Carol II to the throne on June 8, 1930. The cabinet was welcomed by regent Nicholas with the words:
&quot;You are called on to fulfill King Ferdinand&#x27;s dream, and you are the most qualified to do it.&quot;

The PNȚ subsequently repealed the 1926 laws preventing Carol from inheriting the Crown, and faced a constitutional crisis after Constantin Sărățeanu and Patriarch Miron Cristea resigned from the regency in protest. The impasse was quickly prevented, as the two chambers of parliament passed legislation awarding Carol the crown and awarding Michael the honorary dignity of &quot;Grand Voivode of Alba Iulia&quot;. That same evening, Mironescu resigned in order for the king to name a new government.

The king&#x27;s project for a broad-coalition government was not accomplished: Carol offered the appointment to Maniu (who cited health reasons in his refusal, but was in fact disappointed by Carol&#x27;s ongoing scandalous relationship with Magda Lupescu) and then to General Constantin Prezan (who was rejected by the National Liberal Party). Eventually, the king renounced the project, recognized the mandate of Maniu as majority leader, and conceded to a regular cabinet. Mironescu remained in office as Foreign Minister for the duration of his premiership.

His second time in office, with Ion Mihalache as Minister of Internal Affairs and Carol&#x27;s supporter Mihail Manoilescu as Minister of the Economy, was marked by the outlawing of the far right movement known as the Iron Guard and the arrest of its leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (who was later tried and acquitted). Nevertheless, Mironescu was to contribute to the appeal of fascism: his was the first in a series of governments that, faced with the Great Depression, reduced salaries for state employees, who soon began supporting the revolutionary solutions advanced by Codreanu. Other economic measures he took included contracting a foreign loan, ending export taxes on agricultural products and initiating a road-building project. The cabinet was ultimately ousted by the king himself, who nominated an attempted technocracy under Nicolae Iorga (aiming to provide a mask for Carol&#x27;s &quot;camarilla&quot;). In Alexandru Vaida-Voevod&#x27;s government, he was Finance Minister from June to August 1932 and Interior Minister from January to November 1933. He also served as deputy prime minister from October 1932 until November 1933.

In early 1943, during World War II, Mironescu was given a mandate to approach the leadership of Miklós Horthy&#x27;s Hungary, in an attempt by Romania&#x27;s Ion Antonescu to have both countries achieve a new territorial settlement and a common withdrawal from the Axis Powers (&quot;see also Romania during World War II&quot;); he began talks with Miklós Bánffy&#x27;s delegation in Bucharest (June 9), but these negotiations ended when the two sides could not agree on a future status for Northern Transylvania, a region held by Hungary at the time.

He died in Bucharest in 1949.

<text>Claud Raymond VC (2 October 1923 – 22 March 1945) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. As a member of an old County Kerry family with strong links to the Indian Army, Raymond is also regarded as an Irish VC.

==Details==
Claud Raymond was the son of Lieutenant Colonel Maurice Claud Raymond CIE, MC, and Margaret Lilias Nancy Raymond (née Brown), of Fulham. He was 21 years old, and a Lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 21 March 1945 at Talaku, Burma (now Myanmar), Lieutenant Raymond was second-in-command of a reconnaissance patrol when they were fired on by a strongly entrenched enemy detachment and the lieutenant at once led his men towards the position. He was first wounded in the shoulder and then in the head, but continued leading his men forward, when he was hit a third time, his wrist being shattered. He still carried on into the enemy defences where he was largely responsible for capturing the position. In spite of the gravity of his wounds, he refused medical aid until all the other wounded had received attention. He died the next day, aged 21.

==Legacy==
Raymond grew up in Seaford, Sussex, and is remembered on the town&#x27;s war memorial. A road in the town is also named after him.
==The Medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Chatham, Kent.

<doc id="1223159" wikidata="Q58261" url="?curid=1223159" title="Velouté sauce">
<text>A velouté sauce () is a savory sauce that is made from a roux and a light stock. It is one of the &quot;mother sauces&quot; of French cuisine listed by chef Auguste Escoffier in the early twentieth century. &quot;Velouté&quot; is French for &#x27;velvety&#x27;.

In preparing a velouté sauce, a light stock (one in which the bones of the base used have not been roasted previously), such as veal, chicken, or fish stock, is thickened with a blond roux. The sauce produced is commonly referred to by the type of stock used (e.g. chicken velouté, fish velouté, seafood velouté).

==Derived sauces==

&quot;Sauce velouté&quot; often is served on poultry or seafood dishes and is also used as the base for other sauces. 

Sauces derived from a velouté sauce include:
*Albufera sauce: with addition of meat glaze, or &quot;glace de viande&quot;
*Allemande sauce: by adding a few drops of lemon juice, egg yolks, and cream
*Aurore: tomato purée
*Sauce bercy: shallots, white wine, lemon juice, and parsley added to a fish velouté
*Hungarian: onion, paprika, white wine
* Normande sauce: prepared with velouté or fish velouté, cream, butter, and egg yolk as primary ingredients; some versions may use mushroom cooking liquid and oyster liquid or fish fumet added to fish velouté, finished with a liaison of egg yolks and cream.
*Poulette: mushrooms finished with chopped parsley and lemon juice
*Sauce à la polonaise (&quot;Polish-style&quot;): sauce velouté mixed with horseradish, lemon juice, and sour cream (different from Polonaise garnish)
*Sauce ravigote: the addition of a little lemon or white wine vinegar creates a lightly acidic velouté that traditionally is flavored with onions and shallots, and more recently with mustard. 
*Sauce vin blanc: has the addition of fish trim, egg yolks, and butter and, typically, it is served with fish.
*Suprême sauce: by adding a reduction of mushroom liquor (produced in cooking) and cream to a chicken velouté 
*Venetian sauce: tarragon, shallots, chervil
*Wine sauce: such as white wine sauce and champagne sauce

<text>Manolache Costache Epureanu (1823–1880) was twice the Prime Minister of Romania both as a representative of the Conservative Party and of the National Liberal Party, more specifically for the first time in 1870 (20 April–14 December) and for the second time in 1876 (6 May–5 August).

==Biography==
Born in Bârlad, Moldavia, he studied in Heidelberg, Germany and returned to Moldavia to participate in the 1848 revolutionary movement, being part of the ad hoc committee.

In 1866, he was the president of the council which decided to invite a foreign dynasty to rule Romania. In 1871, during the Lascăr Catargiu conservative government, Epureanu was the Minister of Justice between October 1872 and March 1873. He then switched to the opposition and in 1876, he was a national liberal Prime Minister, but later he switched again to the Conservative Party.

He published &quot;Chestia locuitorilor privită din punctul de vedere al Regulamentului organic&quot; (1866) and &quot;Despre pretinsa rescumpărare a căilor ferate&quot; (1879).

He was the father of Elena Bibescu. He died in Schlangenbad, Duchy of Nassau, which is now in Germany.

<text>Interstate 610 (I-610) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that forms a loop around the inner city sector of the city of Houston, Texas. I-610, colloquially known as The Loop, Loop 610, The Inner Loop, or just 610, traditionally marks the border between the inner city of Houston (&quot;inside the Loop&quot;) and its surrounding areas. It is the innermost of the three Houston beltways, the other two being Beltway 8 (Sam Houston Parkway/Tollway) and State Highway 99 (SH 99; Grand Parkway), of which various segments are under construction or planning. In Houston, the area inside I-610 is the urban core. Jeff Balke of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote that the freeway &quot;is as much a social and philosophical divide as a physical one&quot;. Mike Snyder in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that, as someone from inside I-610, he historically felt &quot;kind of special&quot; due to being close to &quot;the city&#x27;s historical core and its major business, educational and cultural institutions&quot;.

==Route description==
Major segments of I-610 are known as the North Loop, the South Loop, the East Loop, and the West Loop. The North Loop runs from U.S. Highway 290 (US 290) to US 90, the East Loop runs from US 90 to SH 225, the West Loop runs from US 290 to the South Post Oak Road spur, and the South Loop runs from South Post Oak Road to SH 225. Sometimes, a direction name is added as a suffix to denote a more specific part of a portion of the loop and this does not denote the direction of traffic flow. For example:
* The North Loop West Freeway refers to the portion of the North Loop between US 290 and I-45. The North Loop East Freeway refers to the portion between I-45 and US 90.
* The East Loop North Freeway refers to the portion of the East Loop between US 90 and I-10. The East Loop South Freeway refers to the portion between I-10 and SH 225.
* The South Loop East Freeway refers to the portion of the South Loop between SH 225 and SH 288. The South Loop West Freeway refers to the portion between SH 288 and the South Post Oak Road spur.
* The West Loop South Freeway refers to the portion of the West Loop between the South Post Oak Road spur and Buffalo Bayou (which is just south of I-10/US 90). The West Loop North Freeway refers to the portion between Buffalo Bayou and US 290.

===Lane configurations===
Starting at US 290, moving in a clockwise direction, mainlane counts are as follows:
* Four lanes each way between US 290 and I-45
* Six lanes each way between I-45 and I-69/US 59
* Four lanes each way between I-69/US 59 and I-10
* Five lanes each way between I-10 and SH 225
* Four lanes each way between SH 225 and SH 288
* Five lanes each way between SH 288 and the South Post Oak Road spur
* Five lanes northbound and four lanes southbound between the South Post Oak Road spur and Bissonnet exit
* Five lanes northbound and five lanes southbound between the Bissonnet and Bellaire Boulevard exits
* Four lanes northbound and five lanes southbound between the Bellaire Boulevard exit and Woodway Drive
* Five lanes each way Woodway Drive and I-10/US 90
* Six lanes each way between I-10/US 90 and US 290

==History==
The concept of building a bypass highway around Houston was first proposed in 1931, but plans did not begin to formalize until 1941. The loop was initially proposed to transport troops and materials around the city. On May 3, Harris County voters approved a bond to build the &quot;Defense Loop&quot;. It was officially designated as Loop 137 in 1942, and the North Loop was approved by the Texas Transportation Commission. World War II delayed construction of the loop until the 1950s.

In July 1953, the city of Houston asked the Texas Transportation Commission to include two new sections of Loop 137 (the West and South loops) as part of the state&#x27;s highway system. It was initially rejected, but, in October 1954, the North Loop was upgraded to a freeway, and the West and South loops were approved as freeways.

When the Interstate Highway System was authorized in 1956, the then-C-shaped Loop 137 (now designated I-610) was adopted into the plan. The East Loop would not be approved until 1960. That segment was finished in 1973 with the opening of the Sidney Sherman Bridge over the Houston Ship Channel.

Construction on the North Loop began in 1950. Construction was sporadic throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It was completed in 1976 with the interchange that connects I-610 to I-10 east of Houston.

In the early 1990s, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) proposed a widening project for the West Loop, which, at the time, was the busiest freeway in Houston. One of the proposals was for a dual–dual freeway with a total of 24 lanes in some places, which would have made it the widest freeway in the world. Amid vocal opposition and little apparent support, the plans for expansion were canceled.

In the late 1990s, the need to repave and reconstruct portions of the West Loop became evident. The reconstruction project was approved, but only as a &quot;no-capacity-added&quot; project; only safety and structural improvements could be made. Some Houston residents, however, have noted that merging lanes and exit ramps are particularly long and, in effect, serve as additional lanes.

, the segment of the West Loop from the Katy Freeway (I-10) to the Southwest Freeway (I-69) is ranked by TxDOT as the most congested roadway in the state, based on annual hours of delay per mile.

Parts of I-610 flooded during Hurricane Harvey in 2017.

<text>In computer science, Fhourstones is an integer benchmark that efficiently solves positions in the game of Connect-4. It was written by John Tromp in 1996-2008, and is incorporated into the Phoronix Test Suite. The measurements are reported as the number of game positions searched per second.

Available in both ANSI-C and Java, it is relatively portable and compact (under 500 lines of source), and uses 50Mb of memory.
The benchmark involves (after warming up on three easier positions) solving the entire game, which takes about ten minutes on contemporary PCs, scoring between 1000 and 12,000 kpos/sec. It has been described as more realistic than some other benchmarks.

Fhourstones was named as a pun on Dhrystone (itself a pun on Whetstone), as &quot;dhry&quot; sounds the same as &quot;drei&quot;, German for &quot;three&quot;: fhourstones is an increment on dhrystones.

<text>Patrick Daniel Tambay (; 25 June 1949 – 4 December 2022) was a French racing driver, broadcaster and politician, who competed in Formula One from to . Tambay won two Formula One Grands Prix across nine seasons.

Born and raised in Paris, Tambay gained training as a racing driver at the Winfield Racing School in 1971. Between and , he raced for an assortment of teams including Surtees, Theodore, Ligier and McLaren with mixed results; he additionally won two Can-Am titles under Carl Haas in 1977 and 1980. Tambay was hired by Ferrari after the death of Gilles Villeneuve in , taking his maiden victory four races later at the . His second and final victory came the following season in San Marino, finishing the season a career-best fourth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. In , Tambay moved to Renault, before ending his Formula One career at Haas Lola, having achieved two wins, five pole positions, two fastest laps and 11 podiums.

Tambay competed in various forms of motorsport following his departure from Formula One, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the World Sportscar Championship, and the Dakar Rally.

==Racing career==

Early in his career, Tambay was a part of Formula 5000 with the team run by Carl Haas.

In 1977, winning the Can Am championship with Haas, Tambay debuted in Formula One on a one-off basis with Surtees, driving in only one session at the 1977 French Grand Prix before spending the rest of the season with Theodore. This partnership proved fruitful, and Tambay moved to McLaren to race Formula One full-time for the 1978 and 1979 seasons. In 1980, he returned to Can Am with the Lola team run by Carl Haas, immediately winning early in the season and then winning his second Can-Am championship.

In 1981 he returned to F1, first driving for the Theodore team then finishing the season with Ligier.

In 1982, he was offered a drive with Arrows by team boss Jackie Oliver to replace the injured Marc Surer in the season-opening South African Grand Prix. He arrived at the track and, when faced with the ongoing turmoil and the possibility of a drivers&#x27; strike, he soon left and did not take part in the race. Later in 1982 he was offered a place with the Scuderia Ferrari after the death of his close friend Gilles Villeneuve. He won his first Grand Prix at the German Grand Prix that year after Didier Pironi was injured in qualifying, in his fourth race for Ferrari. He took his second and last Grand Prix win in 1983 at Imola; driving with Villeneuve&#x27;s #27, he won after Riccardo Patrese crashed near the end of the race.

Despite finishing 4th in the World Championship (with team mate René Arnoux finishing 3rd enabling Ferrari to win the Constructors&#x27; Championship), Tambay was dropped by the Scuderia at the end of 1983 in favor of Italian Michele Alboreto. Tambay then moved from one factory team to the other in Formula One at the time, Renault who had finished 2nd in the 1983 Constructors&#x27; Championship and 2nd in the Drivers&#x27; with fellow Frenchman Alain Prost. Unfortunately for Tambay, after 1983 the factory Renault teams fortunes would go on the downslide and he would spend a somewhat fruitless two seasons before Renault pulled the plug on its factory team with his best results over the and seasons being a single pole position and subsequent 2nd place in the 1984 French Grand Prix at Dijon.

For what would prove to be his final season in Formula One, Tambay was then reunited with his old boss Carl Haas racing in the Haas Lola F1 team in where he spent an even more fruitless season alongside World Champion, Australian driver Alan Jones despite Haas having exclusive use of the new Cosworth designed and built Ford TEC V6 turbo engine. Tambay&#x27;s best result driving either the underpowered Hart engined Lola THL1 or the Ford powered Lola THL2 (which itself was somewhat underpowered compared to its rivals from BMW, Honda, Renault, Ferrari and TAG-Porsche) was a lone 5th place in the THL2 in the 1986 Austrian Grand Prix at the Österreichring (Jones having an equally hard time of it in 1986, finished 4th). Although he regularly out-qualified his former World Championship winning team mate, his 2 points in Austria would be Tambay&#x27;s only points of the 1986 season and thus his last scored in Formula One. With the loss of the lucrative sponsorship from American company Beatrice Foods in mid-1986, Carl Haas shut his Formula One team down at the end of the season and Tambay, unable to find a competitive drive to continue in , retired from the sport.

In 1987, Tambay formed his own sports promotion company in Switzerland, but gave this up in 1989 to return to racing. In 1989, he drove a Jaguar in the World Sportscar Championship and went on to finish fourth in the Le Mans 24 Hours. He then took up desert rally raiding, finishing twice in the top three on the Paris-Dakar. Additionally, he was involved in ice races and the Tour de Corse jet ski race.

==Later life and death==
After retiring from full-time racing, Tambay worked as a commentator for French television. He also served as the deputy mayor of Le Cannet, a suburb of Cannes. He was the godfather to 1997 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve, while his son Adrien raced in the DTM championship between 2012 and 2016. After suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease for several years, Tambay died on 4 December 2022, at age 73. His son Adrien announced his death.

<doc id="1223187" wikidata="Q1166919" url="?curid=1223187" title="Darwin Information Typing Architecture">
<text>The Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) specification defines a set of document types for authoring and organizing topic-oriented information, as well as a set of mechanisms for combining, extending, and constraining document types. It is an open standard that is defined and maintained by the OASIS DITA Technical Committee.

The name derives from the following components:
* Darwin: it uses the principles of specialization and inheritance, which is in some ways analogous to the naturalist Charles Darwin&#x27;s concept of evolutionary adaptation,
* Information Typing: which means each topic has a defined primary objective (procedure, glossary entry, troubleshooting information) and structure,
* Architecture: DITA is an extensible set of structures.

==Features and limitations==
===Content reuse===
Topics are the foundation for content reuse, and can be reused across multiple publications. Fragments of content within topics can be reused through the use of content references (&quot;conref&quot; or &quot;conkeyref&quot;), a transclusion mechanism.

===Information typing ===
The latest version of DITA (DITA 1.3) includes five specialized topic types: &quot;Task&quot;, &quot;Concept&quot;, &quot;Reference&quot;, &quot;Glossary Entry&quot;, and &quot;Troubleshooting&quot;. Each of these five topic types is a specialization of a generic &quot;Topic&quot; type, which contains a title element, a prolog element for metadata, and a body element. The body element contains paragraph, table, and list elements, similar to HTML.

* A &quot;Task&quot; topic is intended for a procedure that describes how to accomplish a task. It lists a series of steps that users follow to produce an intended outcome. The steps are contained in a taskbody element, which is a specialization of the generic body element. The steps element is a specialization of an ordered list element.
* &quot;Concept&quot; information is more objective, containing definitions, rules, and guidelines.
* A &quot;Reference&quot; topic is for topics that describe command syntax, programming instructions, and other reference material, and usually contains detailed, factual material.
* A &quot;Glossary Entry&quot; topic is used for defining a single sense of a given term. In addition to identifying the term and providing a definition, this topic type might also have basic terminology information, along with any acronyms or acronym expansions that may apply to the term.
* The &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; topic describes a condition that the reader may want to correct, followed by one or more descriptions of its cause and suggested remedies.

===Maps===
A DITA map is a container for topics used to transform a collection of content into a publication. It gives the topics sequence and structure. A map can include relationship tables (reltables) that define hyperlinks between topics. Maps can be nested: they can reference topics or other maps, and can contain a variety of content types and metadata.

===Metadata===
DITA includes extensive metadata elements and attributes, both at topic level and within elements. Conditional text allows filtering or styling content based on attributes for audience, platform, product, and other properties. The conditional processing profile ( file) is used to identify which values are to be used for conditional processing.

===Specialization===
DITA allows adding new elements and attributes through specialization of base DITA elements and attributes. Through specialization, DITA can accommodate new topic types, element types, and attributes as needed for specific industries or companies. Specializations of DITA for specific industries, such as the semiconductor industry, are standardized through OASIS technical committees or subcommittees. Many organizations using DITA also develop their own specializations.

The extensibility of DITA permits organizations to specialize DITA by defining specific information structures and still use standard tools to work with them. The ability to define company-specific information architectures enables companies to use DITA to enrich content with metadata that is meaningful to them, and to enforce company-specific rules on document structure.

===Topic orientation===

DITA content is created as topics, each an individual XML file. Typically, each topic covers a specific subject with a singular purpose, for example, a conceptual topic that provides an overview, or a procedural topic that explains how to accomplish a task. Content should be structured to resemble the file structure in which it is contained.

==Creating content in DITA==
DITA map and topic documents are XML files. As with HTML, any images, video files, or other files that must appear in the output are inserted via reference. Any XML editor or even text editor can be used to write DITA content, depending on the level of support required while authoring. Aids to authoring featured in specialized editors include WYSIWYG preview rendering, validation, and integration with a DITA processor, like DITA-OT or ditac.

==Publishing content written in DITA==
DITA is designed as an end-to-end architecture. In addition to indicating what elements, attributes, and rules are part of the DITA language, the DITA specification includes rules for publishing DITA content in HTML, online Help, print, Content Delivery Platform and other formats.

For example, the DITA specification indicates that if the &quot;conref &quot; attribute of element &quot;A&quot; contains a path to element &quot;B&quot;, the contents of element &quot;B&quot; will display in the location of element &quot;A&quot;. DITA-compliant publishing solutions, known as DITA processors, must handle the &quot;conref&quot; attribute according to the specified behaviour. Rules also exist for processing other rich features such as conditional text, index markers, and topic-to-topic links. Applications that transform DITA content into other formats, and meet the DITA specification&#x27;s requirements for interpreting DITA markup, are known as &quot;DITA processors&quot;.

===Localization===
DITA provides support for translation via the localisation attribute group. Element attributes can be set to indicate whether the content of the element should be translated. The language of the element content can be specified, as can the writing direction, the index filtering and some terms that are injected when publishing to the final format. A DITA project can be converted to an XLIFF file and back into its original maps and topics, using the DITA-XLIFF Roundtrip Tool for DITA-OT and computer-assisted translation (CAT) tools, like Swordfish Translation Editor or Fluenta DITA Translation Manager, a tool designed to implement the translation workflow suggested by the article &quot;Using XLIFF to Translate DITA Projects&quot; published by the DITA Adoption TC at OASIS.

<text>Michael James &quot;Mickey&quot; O&#x27;Rourke (March 19, 1878 – December 6, 1957), was an Irish-Canadian soldier and dockworker. O&#x27;Rourke was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest, most prestigious decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==
There is little documentation of O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s life prior to World War I. Born in Limerick, Ireland, he served in the Royal Munster Fusiliers before emigrating to Canada where he joined the Canadian militia in Revelstoke, British Columbia. He also worked as a miner. 

== World War I ==
O&#x27;Rourke joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in February 1915. He had already been awarded the Military Medal for bravery at the Battle of the Somme when, as a member of the 7th (1st British Columbia) Battalion, the following action took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

During the period 15/17 August 1917 at the Battle of Hill 70 near Lens, France, Private O&#x27;Rourke, who was a stretcher-bearer, worked unceasingly for three days and nights bringing in the wounded, dressing their wounds and getting them food and water. During the whole of this period the area in which he worked was swept by heavy machine-gun and rifle fire and on several occasions he was knocked down and partially buried by enemy shells. His courage and devotion in carrying out his rescue work in spite of exhaustion and incessant heavy fire inspired all ranks and undoubtedly saved many lives.

== Later life ==

After the war, O&#x27;Rourke went to California, then returned to British Columbia where he eked out an existence on Vancouver&#x27;s skid road, surviving on a disability pension of 10 dollars per month and casual work on the docks. During the Vancouver longshoremen&#x27;s strike of 1935, he headed a protest march of about 1,000 strikers, wearing his medals and carrying the Union Jack. The marchers attempted to pass a police line guarding the waterfront and were attacked with clubs and tear gas in what came to be known as the Battle of Ballantyne Pier.

O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s later life was complicated by war-related chronic health problems and alcoholism. He died as an indigent at a Veterans&#x27; Affairs facility in Burnaby, BC, on December 6, 1957. His grave is located at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Burnaby.

<text>Meridian House is a historic mansion in Washington, D.C., located in the Meridian Hill neighborhood of Northwest D.C.. It was designed by American architect John Russell Pope and built in 1920 for Ambassador Irwin B. Laughlin, who filled it with his extensive collection of French paintings and Oriental porcelain. It stayed in the Laughlin family until 1960, when it was purchased by the non-profit Meridian International Center.

==History==

Meridian House was built by American diplomat Irwin B. Laughlin. He purchased the land in 1912, two years after his friend Henry White bought the adjacent site at 1624 Crescent Place. After a long career with the US Foreign Service, Laughlin retired in 1919 and built Meridian House, filling it with his collection of 18th-century French drawings and Oriental porcelains and screens. Although he later returned to the diplomatic corps, serving as Ambassador to Greece and Spain in the 1920s and &#x27;30s, Laughlin also played an active role in Washington&#x27;s artistic and historical communities.

Ambassador Laughlin was married to Therese Iselin, daughter of New York City banker Adrian Iselin Jr. Their daughter, Gertrude, who married Rear Admiral Hubert Winthrop Chanler, lived in Meridian House during her youth and from time to time after her marriage, especially when her husband was away on naval assignments. The house remained in the Laughlin family until 1958.

In 1960, a newly created non-profit organization dedicated to promoting international understanding, which later became Meridian International Center, received a grant from the Ford Foundation to purchase Meridian House. Gertrude Laughlin Chanler served as a Meridian trustee for many years and made a substantial donation to start Meridian&#x27;s endowment. Her children continue to support Meridian International Center and frequently visit the house with their own children.

==The House==

===Architecture===

In 1929, Meridian House was described by &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; as,

Perhaps as fine a piece of work of its kind as this country can show ... Certainly the manner of this house has not in this country been better done, not only in terms of stylistic authenticity, but in terms of pure architecture, meaning good taste in selectivity, in elimination, in execution. It cannot from its nature do otherwise than set a standard which should endure permanently.

After undergoing a major renovation in 1994, Meridian House&#x27;s principal rooms retain their architectural detail as well as some of the original decorative features, such as the 18th-century European overdoor paintings and antique brass hardware and lighting fixtures. The classical symmetry of the Louis XVI style is reflected throughout the house.

=== Dining room ===

The dining room features a beautiful Mortlake tapestry, which has been dated by experts as late 17th century. The tapestry, purchased by the Laughlin family in England at the turn of the century, depicts the legendary reception given Alexander the Great by the Greek philosopher Diogenes. An almost identical tapestry hangs in Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The dining room also features two portraits - one of Ambassador Laughlin and one of his daughter, Gertrude Laughlin Chanler, as a child. A portrait of Mrs. Laughlin hangs nearby in the Chairmen&#x27;s Study. All three were painted by Philip de László, the renowned portrait artist of the early 20th century.

=== Reception ===
The reception gallery remains much as it was at the time the Laughlin family occupied the house. The wrought-iron and marble-topped side tables, the four Waterford crystal torcheres in the corners, the blue Chinese temple jars, and the antique clock and barometer on the mirrored walls are all part of the original furnishings.

The loggia, which links the major reception rooms and rear garden, includes four marble busts sculpted in France, representing the four seasons.

A Latin inscription, &quot;&quot;, appears over the front door and translates &quot;Where happiness dwells, evil will not enter.&quot; Another inscription, over the rear courtyard doors, reads: &quot;&quot;Purior hic aer: late hinc conspectus in urbem&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;Purer here the air whence we overlook the city,&quot; a quotation also inscribed on a house at the top of Rome&#x27;s Spanish Steps.

===Gardens===

The rear and side gardens largely retain their original design. The pebbled courtyard has 40 linden trees, imported from Europe when the house was built. The statues throughout the garden are original to the house, as are the statues at the four roof-line corners.

<text>Group Captain Gilbert Stuart Martin Insall, (14 May 1894 – 17 February 1972) was a British aviator and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth subjects.

==First World War==
Insall was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Royal Flying Corps on 14 March 1915, during the First World War. He was appointed a Flying Officer in the RFC on 16 July, and was confirmed in his rank from the same date.

Insall was 21 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 11 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps when he won the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 7 November 1915 near Achiet-le-Grand, France, Second Lieutenant Insall, on patrol in Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus No. 5074 with 1st Class Air Mechanic T. H. Donald, engaged an Aviatik two-seater and forced the German pilot to make a rough landing in a ploughed field. Seeing the air crew scramble out and prepare to fire, Insall dived to 500 ft and his gunner opened fire, whereupon the Germans fled. After dropping an incendiary bomb on the downed German aircraft, Insall flew through heavy fire at 2000 ft over enemy trenches. The Vickers&#x27; petrol tank was hit, but Insall brought the plane 500 yards back inside Allied lines for an emergency landing. Insall and Donald stayed by the Gunbus through a bombardment of about 150 shells while awaiting nightfall. After dark, they then set to work by torch light to salvage their plane. After they repaired the machine overnight, Insall flew them back to base at dawn.

The announcement and accompanying citation for Insall&#x27;s VC was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 23 December 1915, reading:

Insall could not personally receive his VC in 1915, however; he and Donald had fallen wounded into captivity on 14 December 1915 after engaging Hauptmann Martin Zander and his gunner. While in captivity, he was promoted to lieutenant, on 1 April 1916. Insall escaped on his third try, on 28 August 1917, and made it home over the Dutch border on 6 September. His VC was presented by the King on 27 September 1917. He returned to duty as the Flight Commander of &quot;A&quot; Flight, 50 Squadron, with the temporary rank of captain, on 11 January 1918.

==Royal Air Force career==

After the war, Insall remained in the service, receiving a permanent commission as a Captain in the newly formed Royal Air Force. On 1 August 1919; his rank was regraded to Flight Lieutenant when the RAF adopted its new rank structure. He was promoted to Squadron Leader on 1 November. On 16 December, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for gallantry in escaping from captivity as a POW during the war.

On a clear day in 1925, he spotted a strange formation of pits in the ground below him. He took a photograph, and from this one photograph came the rediscovery of the Bronze Age site now known as Woodhenge two miles from Stonehenge (Crawford, Air-Photography for Archaeologists 1929). In 1929 he similarly discovered Arminghall Henge.

Insall served in Southern Mesopotamia (Iraq) against the Akhwan in 1927–1928, for which he was mentioned in despatches and awarded the General Service Medal (1918). As a Squadron Leader he was responsible for reforming No 35 Sqn which stood up on 1 March 1929 and served as its first Commanding Officer for three months until June 1929. He was promoted to Wing Commander shortly after on 1 July 1929 and took up the post of Station Commander at RAF Donibristle later that month. On 23 July 1932 he was appointed as Station Commander at RAF Upavon. On 15 May 1934 he moved to RAF Kenley, again filling the post of Station Commander. He was later promoted to Group Captain on 1 July 1935 and served overseas in the Middle East before returning to the UK in 1939 to fill the post of Officer Commanding No.3 RAF Depot at RAF Padgate from 1 April 1939. He served at this rank throughout the Second World War in a number of posts and finally retired from RAF service on 30 July 1945. Insall&#x27;s headstone is in Nocton Churchyard, Lincolnshire. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum in Hendon.

<doc id="1223245" wikidata="Q603441" url="?curid=1223245" title="Bibliometrics">
<text>Bibliometrics is the application of statistical methods to the study of bibliographic data, especially in scientific and library and information science contexts, and is closely associated with scientometrics (the analysis of scientific metrics and indicators) to the point that both fields largely overlap.

Bibliometrics studies first appeared in the late 19th century. They have known a significant development after the Second World War in a context of &quot;periodical crisis&quot; and new technical opportunities offered by computing tools. In the early 1960s, the Science Citation Index of Eugene Garfield and the citation network analysis of Derek John de Solla Price laid the fundamental basis of a structured research program on bibliometrics.

Citation analysis is a commonly used bibliometric method based on constructing the citation graph, a network or graph representation of the citations shared by documents. Many research fields use bibliometric methods to explore the impact of their field, the impact of a set of researchers, the impact of a particular paper, or to identify particularly impactful papers within a specific field of research. Bibliometrics tools have been commonly integrated in descriptive linguistics, the development of thesauri, and evaluation of reader usage. Beyond specialized scientific use, popular web search engines, such as the pagerank algorithm implemented by Google have been largely shaped by bibliometrics methods and concepts.

The emergence of the Web and the open science movement has gradually transformed the definition and the purpose of &quot;bibliometrics.&quot; In the 2010s historical proprietary infrastructures for citation data such as the Web of Science or Scopus have been challenged by new initiatives in favor of open citation data. The &quot;Leiden Manifesto for Research Metrics&quot; (2015) opened a wide debate on the use and transparency of metrics.

==Definition==

The term &quot;bibliométrie&quot; was first used by Paul Otlet in 1934, and defined as &quot;the measurement of all aspects related to the publication and reading of books and documents.&quot; The anglicized version &quot;bibliometrics&quot; was first used by Alan Pritchard in a paper published in 1969, titled &quot;Statistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics?&quot; He defined the term as &quot;the application of mathematics and statistical methods to books and other media of communication.&quot; &quot;Bibliometrics&quot; was conceived as a replacement for &quot;statistical bibliography&quot;, the main label used by publications in the field until then: for Pritchard, statistical bibliography was too &quot;clumsy&quot; and did not make it very clear what was the main object of study.

The concept of bibliometrics &quot;stresses the material aspect of the undertaking: counting books, articles, publications, citations&quot;. In theory, bibliometrics is a distinct field from &quot;scientometrics&quot; (from the Russian &quot;naukometriya&quot;), which relies on the analysis of non-bibliographic indicators of scientific activity. In practice, bibliometrics and scientometrics studies tend to use similar data sources and methods, as citation data has become the leading standard of quantitative scientific evaluation during the mid-20th century: &quot;insofar as bibliometric techniques are applied to scientific and technical literature, the two areas of scientometrics and bibliometrics overlap to a considerable degree.&quot; The development of the web and the expansion of bibliometrics approach to non-scientific production has entailed the introduction of broader labels in the 1990s and the 2000s: infometrics, webometrics or cybermetrics. These terms have not been extensively adopted, as they partly overlap with pre-existing research practices, such as information retrieval.

==History==
Scientific works, studies and researches that have a bibliometric character can be identified, depending on the definition, already for the 12th century in the form of Jewish indexes.

===Early experiments (1880–1914)===
Bibliometric analysis appeared at the turn of the 19th and the 20th century. These developments predate the first occurrence of the concept of &quot;bibiometrics&quot; by several decades. Alternative label were commonly used: &quot;bibliography statistics&quot; became especially prevalent after 1920 and continued to remain in use until the end of the 1960s. Early statistical studies of scientific metadata were motivated by the significant expansion of scientific output and the parallel development of indexing services of databases that made this information more accessible in the first place. Citation index were first applied to case law in the 1860s and their most famous example, &quot;Shepard&#x27;s Citations&quot; (first published in 1873) will serve as a direct inspiration for the Science Citation Index one century later.

The emergence of social sciences inspired new speculative research on the &quot;science of science&quot; and the possibility of studying science itself as a scientific object: &quot;The belief that social activities, including science, could be reduced to quantitative laws, just as the trajectory of a cannonball and the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, traces back to the positivist sociology of Auguste Comte, William Ogburn, and Herbert Spencer.&quot; Bibliometric analysis was not conceived as a separate body studies but one of the available methods for the quantitative analysis of scientific activity in different fields of research: science history (&quot;Histoire des sciences et des savants depuis deux siècles&quot; of Alphonse de Candolle in 1885, &quot;The history of comparative anatomy, a statistical analysis of the literature&quot; by Francis Joseph Cole and Nellie B. Eales in 1917), bibliography (&quot;The Theory of National and International Bibliography&quot; of Francis Burburry Campbell in 1896) or sociology of science (&quot;Statistics of American Psychologists&quot; of James McKeen Cattell in 1903).

Early bibliometrics and scientometrics work were not simply descriptive but expressed normative views of what science should be and how it could progress. The measurement of the performance of individual researchers, scientific institutions or entire countries was a major objective. The statistical analysis of James McKeen Cattell acted as a preparatory work for a large scale evaluation of American researchers with eugenicists undertones: &quot;American Men of Science&quot; (1906), &quot;with its astoundingly simplistic rating system of asterisks attached to individual entries in proportion to the estimated eminence of the starred scholar.&quot;

===Development of bibliography statistics (1910–1945)===

After 1910, bibliometrics approach increasingly became the main focus in several study of scientific performance rather than one quantitative method among others. In 1917, Francis Joseph Cole and Nellie B. Eales argued in favor of the primary statistical value of publications as a publication &quot;is an isolated and definite piece of work, it is permanent, accessible, and may be judged, and in most cases it is not difficult to ascertain when, where, and by whom it was done, and to plot the results on squared paper.&quot; Five years later, Edward Wyndham Hulme expanded this argument to the point that publications could be considered as the standard measure of an entire civilization: &quot;If civilization is but the product of the human mind operating upon a shifting platform of its environment, we may claim for bibliography that it is not only a pillar in the structure of the edifice, but that it can function as a measure of the varying forces to which this structure is continuously subjected.&quot; This shift toward publication had a limited impact: well until the 1970s, national and international evaluation of scientific activities &quot;disdained bibliometric indicators&quot; which were deemed too simplistic, in favor of socological and economic measures.

Both the enhanced value attached to scientific publications as a measure of knowledge and the difficulties met by libraries to manage the growing flow of academic periodicals entailed the development of the first citation indexes. In 1927, P. Gross and E. M. Gross compiled the 3,633 references quoted by the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; during the year 1926 and ranked journals depending on their level of citation. The two authors created a set of tools and methods still commonly used by academic search engines, including attributing a bonus to recent citations since &quot;the &quot;present trend&quot; rather than the &quot;past performance&quot; of a journal should be considered first.&quot; Yet the academic environment measured was markedly different: German rather than English ranked by far the main language of science of chemistry with more than 50% of all references.

In the same period, fundamental algorithms, metrics and methods of bibliometrics were first identified in several unrelated projects, most of them being related to the structural inequalities of scientific production. In Alfred Lotka introduced its law of productivity from an analysis of the authored publications in the &quot;Chemical Abstracts&quot; and the &quot;Geschichtstafeln der Physik&quot;: the number of authors producing an n number of contributions is equal to the 1/n^2 number of authors that only produced one publication. In, the chief librarian of the London Science Museum, Samuel Bradford derived a &quot;law of scattering&quot; from his experience in bibliographic indexing: there are exponentially diminishing returns of searching for references in science journals, as more and more work need to be consulted to find relevant work. Both the Lotka and Bradford law have been criticized as they are far from universal and rather uncovers a rough power law relationship rendered by deceivingly precise equations.

===Periodical crisis, digitization and citation index (1945–1960)===
After the Second World War, the growing challenge in managing and accessing scientific publications turned into a full-fledged &quot;periodical crisis&quot;: existing journals could not keep up with the rapidly increasing scientific output spurred by the big science projects. The issue became politically relevant after the successful launch of Sputnik in 1957: &quot;The Sputnik crisis turned the librarians&#x27; problem of bibliographic control into a national information crisis..&quot; In a context of rapid and dramatic change, the emerging field of bibliometrics was linked to large scale reforms of academic publishing and nearly utopian visions of the future of science. In 1934, Paul Otlet introduced under the concept of &quot;bibliométrie&quot; or &quot;bibliology&quot; an ambitious project of measuring the impact of texts on society. In contrast with the bounded definition of &quot;bibliometrics&quot; that will become prevalent after the 1960s, the vision of Otlet was not limited to scientific publication nor in fact to &quot;publication&quot; as a fundamental unit: it aimed for &quot;by the resolution of texts into atomic elements, or ideas, which he located in the single paragraphs (alinéa, verset, articulet) composing a book.&quot; In 1939 John Desmond Bernal envisioned a network of scientific archives, which was briefly considered by the Royal Society in 1948: &quot;The scientific paper sent to the central publication office, upon approval by an editorial board of referees, would be microfilmed, and a sort of print-on-demand system set in action thereafter.&quot; While not using the concept of &quot;bibliometrics&quot;, Bernal had a formative influence of leading figures of the field such as Derek John de Solla Price.

The emerging computing technologies were immediately considered as a potential solution to make a larger amount of scientific output readable and searchable. During the 1950s and 1960s, an uncoordinated wave of experiments in indexing technologies resulted in the rapid development of key concepts of computing research retrieval. In 1957, IBM engineer Hans Peter Luhn introduced an influential paradigm of statistical-based analysis of word frequencies, as &quot;communication of ideas by means of words is carried out on the basis of statistical probability.&quot; Automated translation of non-English scientific work has also significantly contributed to fundamental research on natural language processing of bibliographic references, as in this period a significant amount of scientific publications were not still available in English, especially the one coming from the Soviet bloc. Influent members of the National Science Foundation like Joshua Ledeberg advocated for the creation of a &quot;centralized information system&quot;, SCITEL, partly influenced by the ideas of John Desmond Bernal. This system would at first coexist with printed journals and gradually replace them altogether on account of its efficiency. In the plan laid out by Ledeberg to Eugen Garfield in November 1961, a centralized deposit would index as much as 1,000,000 scientific articles per year. Beyond full-text searching, the infrastructure would also ensure the indexation of citation and other metadata, as well as the automated translation of foreign language articles.

The first working prototype on an online retrieval system developed in 1963 by Doug Engelbart and Charles Bourne at the Stanford Research Institute proved the feasibility of these theoretical assumptions, although it was heavily constrained by memory issues: no more than 10,000 words of a few documents could be indexed. The early scientific computing infrastructures were focused on more specific research areas, such as MEDLINE for medicine, NASA/RECON for space engineering or OCLC Worldcat for library search: &quot;most of the earliest online retrieval system provided access to a bibliographic database and the rest used a file containing another sort of information—encyclopedia articles, inventory data, or chemical compounds.&quot; Exclusive focus on text analysis proved limitative as the digitized collections expanded: a query could yield a large number results and it was difficult to evaluate the relevancy and the accuracy of the results.

The &quot;periodical crisis&quot; and the limitations of index retrieval technologies motivated the development of bibliometric tools and large citation index like the Science Citation Index of Eugene Garfield. Garfield&#x27;s work was initially primarily concerned with the automated analysis of text work. In contrast with ongoing work largely focused on internal semantic relationship, Garfield highlighted &quot;the importance of metatext in discourse analysis&quot;, such as introductory sentences and bibliographic references. Secondary forms of scientific production like literature reviews and bibliographic notes became central to Garfield&#x27;s vision as they have already been to John Desmond Bernal&#x27;s vision of scientific archives. By 1953, Garfield&#x27;s attention was permanently shifted to citation analysis: in a private letter to William C. Adair, the vice-president of the publisher of the Shepard&#x27;s Citation index, &quot;he suggested a well tried solution to the problem of automatic indexing, namely to &quot;shepardize&quot; biomedical literature, to untangle the skein of its content by following the thread of citation links in the same way the legal citator did with court sentences.&quot; In 1955, Garfield published his seminal article &quot;Citation Indexes for Science&quot;, that both laid out the outline of the Science Citation Index and had a large influence on the future development of bibliometrics. The general citation index envisioned by Garfield was originally one of the building block of the ambitious plan of Joshua Lederberg to computerize scientific literature. Due to lack of funding, the plan was never realized. In 1963, Eugene Garfield created the Institute for Scientific Information that aimed to transform the projects initially envisioned with Lederberg into a profitable business.

===Bibliometric reductionism, metrics, and structuration of a research field (1960–1990)===
The field of bibliometrics coalesced in parallel to the development of the Science Citation Index, that was to become its fundamental infrastructure and data resource: &quot;while the early twentieth century contributed methods that were necessary for measuring research, the mid-twentieth century was characterized by the development of institutions that motivated and facilitated research measurement.&quot; Significant influences of the nascent field included along with John Desmond Bernal, Paul Otlet the sociology of science of Robert K. Merton, that was re-interpreted in a non-ethic manner: the Matthew Effect, that is the increasing concentration of attention given to researchers that were already notable, was no longer considered &quot;as a derive&quot;(?) but a feature of normal science.

A follower of Bernal, the British historian of science Derek John de Solla Price has had a major impact on the disciplinary formation of bibliometrics: with &quot;the publication of &quot;Science Since Babylon&quot; (1961), &quot;Little Science, Big Science&quot; (1963), and &quot;Networks of Scientific Papers&quot; (1965) by Derek Price, scientometrics already had a sound empirical and conceptual toolkit available.&quot; Price was a proponent of &quot;bibliometric reductionism&quot;. As Francis Joseph Cole and Nellie B. Eales in 1917, he argued that a publication is the best possible standard to lay out a quantitative study of science: they &quot;resemble a pile of bricks (…) to remain in perpetuity as an intellectual edifice built by skill and artifice, resting on primitive foundation.&quot; Price doubled down on this reductionist approach by limiting in turn the large set of existing bibliographic data to citation data.

Price&#x27;s framework, like Garfield&#x27;s, takes for granted the structural inequality of science production, as a minority of researchers creates a large share of publication and an even smaller share have a real measurable impact on subsequent research (with as few as 2% of papers having 4 citations or more at the time). Despite the unprecedented growth of post-war science, Price claimed for the continued existence of an &quot;invisible college&quot; of elite scientists that, as in the time of Robert Boyle undertook the most valuable work. While Price was aware of the power relationships that ensured the domination of such an elite, there was a fundamental ambiguity in the bibliometrics studies, that highlighted the concentration of academic publishing and prestige but also created tools, models and metrics that normalized pre-existing inequalities. The central position of the Scientific Citation Index amplified this performative effect. In the end of the 1960s Eugene Garfield formulated a &quot;law of concentration&quot; that was formally a reinterpretation of the Samuel Bradford&#x27;s &quot;law of scattering&quot;, with a major difference: while Bradford talked for the perspective of a specific research project, Garfield drew a generalization of the law to the entire set of scientific publishing: &quot;the core literature for all scientific disciplines involves a group of no more than 1000 journals, and may involve as few as 500.&quot; Such law was also a justification of the practical limitation of the citation index to a limited subset of &quot;core&quot; journals, with the underlying assumption that any expansion into second-tier journals would yield diminishing returns. Rather than simply observing structural trends and patterns, bibliometrics tend to amplify and stratify them even further: &quot;Garfield&#x27;s citation indexes would have brought to a logical completion, the story of a stratified scientific literature produced by (…) a few, high-quality, &quot;must-buy&quot; international journals owned by a decreasing number of multinational corporations ruling the roost in the global information market.&quot;

Under the impulsion of Garfield and Price, bibliometrics became both a research field and a testing ground for quantitative policy evaluation of research. This second aspect was not a major focus of the Science Citation Index has been a progressive development: the famous Impact Factor was originally devised in the 1960s by Garfield and Irving Sher to select the core group of journals that were to be featured in &quot;Current Contents&quot; and the Science Citation Index and was only regularly published after 1975. The metric itself is a very simple ratio between the total count of citation received by the journal on the past year and its productivity on the past two years, to ponderate the prolificity of some publications. For example, &quot;Nature&quot; had an impact factor of 41.577 in 2017:

formula_1

The simplicity of the impact factor has likely been a major factor in its wide adoption by scientific institutions, journals, funders or evaluators: &quot;none of the revised versions or substitutes of ISI IF has gained general acceptance beyond its proponents, probably because the alleged alternatives lack the degree of interpretability of the original measure.&quot;

Alongside these simplified measurements, Garfield continued to support and fund fundamental research in science history and sociology of science. First published 1964, &quot;The Use of Citation Data in Writing the History of Science&quot; compiles several experimental case studies relying on the citation network of the Science Citation Index, including a quantitative reconstruction of the discovery of the DNA. Interest in this area persisted well after the sell of the Index to Thomson Reuters: as late as 2001, Garfield unveiled &quot;HistCite&quot;, a software for &quot;algorithmic historiography&quot; created in collaboration with Alexander Pudovkin, and Vladimir S. Istomin.

===The Web turn (1990–present)===

The development of the World Wide Web and the Digital Revolution had a complex impact on bibliometrics.

The web itself and some of its key components (such as search engines) were partly a product of bibliometrics theory. In its original form, it was derived from a bibliographic scientific infrastructure commissioned to Tim Berners-Lee by the CERN for the specific needs of high energy physics, ENQUIRE. The structure of ENQUIRE was closer to an internal web of data: it connected &quot;nodes&quot; that &quot;could refer to a person, a software module, etc. and that could be interlined with various relations such as made, include, describes and so forth.&quot; Sharing of data and data documentation was a major focus in the initial communication of the World Wide Web when the project was first unveiled in August 1991 : &quot;The WWW project was started to allow high energy physicists to share data, news, and documentation. We are very interested in spreading the web to other areas, and having gateway servers for other data.&quot; The web rapidly superseded pre-existing online infrastructure, even when they included more advanced computing features. The core value attached to hyperlinking in the design of the web seem to validate the intuitions of the funding figures of bibliometrics: &quot;The onset of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s made Garfield&#x27;s citationist dream more likely to come true. In the world network of hypertexts, not only is the bibliographic reference one of the possible forms taken by a hyperlink inside the electronic version of a scientific article, but the Web itself also exhibits a citation structure, links between web pages being formally similar to bibliographic citations.&quot; Consequently, bibliometrics concepts have been incorporated in major communication technologies the search algorithm of Google: &quot;the citation-driven concept of relevance applied to the network of hyperlinks between web pages would revolutionize the way Web search engines let users quickly pick useful materials out of the anarchical universe of digital information.&quot;

While the web expanded the intellectual influence of bibliometrics way beyond specialized scientific research, it also shattered the core tenets of the field. In contrast with the wide utopian visions of Bernal and Otlet that partly inspired it, the Science Citation Index was always conceived as a closed infrastructure, not only from the perspective of their users but also from the perspective of the collection index: the logical conclusion of Price&#x27;s theory of &quot;invisible college&quot; and Garfield&#x27;s law of concentration was to focus exclusively on a limited set of core scientific journals. With the rapid expansion of the Web, numerous forms of publications (notably preprints), scientific activities and communities suddenly became visible and highlighted by contrast the limitations of applied bibliometrics. The other fundamental aspect of bibliometric reductionism, the exclusive focus on citation, has also been increasingly fragilized by the multiplication of alternative data sources and the unprecedented access to full text corpus that made it possible to revive the large scale semantic analysis first envisioned by Garfield in the early 1950s: &quot;Links alone, then, just like bibliographic citations alone, do not seem sufficient to pin down critical communication patterns on the Web, and their statistical analysis will probably follow, in the years to come, the same path of citation analysis, establishing fruitful alliances with other emerging qualitative and quantitative outlooks over the web landscape.&quot;

The close relationship between bibliometrics and commercial vendors of citation data and indicators has become more strained since the 1990s. Leading scientific publishers have diversified their activities beyond publishing and moved &quot;from a content-provision to a data analytics business.&quot; By 2019, Elsevier has either acquired or built a large portofolio platforms, tools, databases and indicators covering all aspects and stages of scientific research: &quot;the largest supplier of academic journals is also in charge of evaluating and validating research quality and impact (e.g., Pure, Plum Analytics, Sci Val), identifying academic experts for potential employers (e.g., Expert Lookup5), managing the research networking platforms through which to collaborate (e.g., SSRN, Hivebench, Mendeley), managing the tools through which to find funding (e.g., Plum X, Mendeley, Sci Val), and controlling the platforms through which to analyze and store researchers&#x27; data (e.g., Hivebench, Mendeley).&quot; Metrics and indicators are key components of this vertical integration: &quot;Elsevier&#x27;s further move to offering metrics-based decision making is simultaneously a move to gain further influence in the entirety of the knowledge production process, as well as to further monetize its disproportionate ownership of content.&quot; The new market for scientific publication and scientific data has been compared with the business models of social networks, search engines and other forms of &quot;platform capitalism&quot; While content access is free, it is indirectly paid through data extraction and surveillance. In 2020, Rafael Ball envisioned a bleak future for bibliometricians where their research contribute to the emerge of a highly invasive form of &quot;surveillance capitalism&quot;:scientists &quot;be given a whole series of scores which not only provide a more comprehensive picture of the academic performance, but also the perception, behaviour, demeanour, appearance and (subjective) credibility (…) In China, this kind of personal data analysis is already being implemented and used simultaneously as an incentive and penalty system.&quot;

The &quot;Leiden manifesto for research metrics&quot; (2015) highlighted the growing rift between the commercial providers of scientific metrics and bibliometric communities. The signatories stressed the potential social damage of uncontrolled metric-based evaluation and surveillance: &quot;as scientometricians, social scientists and research administrators, we have watched with increasing alarm the pervasive misapplication of indicators to the evaluation of scientific performance.&quot; Several structural reforms of bibliometric research and research evaluation are proposed, including a stronger reliance on qualitative assessment and the reliance on &quot;open, transparent and simple&quot; data collection. The Leiden Manifesto has stirred an important debate in bibliometrics/scientometrics/infometrics with some critics arguing that the elaboration of quantitative metrics bears no responsibility on their misuse in commercial platforms and research evaluation.

==Usage==
Historically, bibliometric methods have been used to trace relationships amongst academic journal citations. Citation analysis, which involves examining an item&#x27;s referring documents, is used in searching for materials and analyzing their merit. Citation indices, such as Institute for Scientific Information&#x27;s Web of Science, allow users to search forward in time from a known article to more recent publications which cite the known item.

Data from citation indexes can be analyzed to determine the popularity and impact of specific articles, authors, and publications. Using citation analysis to gauge the importance of one&#x27;s work, for example, has been common in hiring practices of the late 20th century. Information scientists also use citation analysis to quantitatively assess the core journal titles and watershed publications in particular disciplines; interrelationships between authors from different institutions and schools of thought; and related data about the sociology of academia. Some more pragmatic applications of this information includes the planning of retrospective bibliographies, &quot;giving some indication both of the age of material used in a discipline, and of the extent to which more recent publications supersede the older ones&quot;; indicating through high frequency of citation which documents should be archived; comparing the coverage of secondary services which can help publishers gauge their achievements and competition, and can aid librarians in evaluating &quot;the effectiveness of their stock.&quot; There are also some limitations to the value of citation data. They are often incomplete or biased; data has been largely collected by hand (which is expensive), though citation indexes can also be used; incorrect citing of sources occurs continually; thus, further investigation is required to truly understand the rationale behind citing to allow it to be confidently applied.

Bibliometrics can be used for understanding the research hot topics, for example, in housing Bibliometrics, the results show that Keywords such as influencing factors of housing prices, supply and demand analysis, policy impact on housing prices, and regional city trends are commonly found in housing price research literature. Recent popular keywords include regression analysis and house price predictions. The USA has been a pioneer in housing price research, with well-established means and methods leading the way in this field. Developing countries, on the other hand, need to adopt innovative research approaches and focus more on sustainability in their housing price studies. Research indicates a strong correlation between housing prices and the economy, with keywords like gross domestic product, interest rates, and currency frequently appearing in economic-related cluster analyses.

Bibliometrics are now used in quantitative research assessment exercises of academic output which is starting to threaten practice based research. The UK government has considered using bibliometrics as a possible auxiliary tool in its Research Excellence Framework, a process which will assess the quality of the research output of UK universities and on the basis of the assessment results, allocate research funding. This has met with significant skepticism and, after a pilot study, looks unlikely to replace the current peer review process. Furthermore, excessive usage of bibliometrics in assessment of value of academic research encourages gaming the system in various ways including publishing large quantity of works with low new content (see least publishable unit), publishing premature research to satisfy the numbers, focusing on popularity of the topic rather than scientific value and author&#x27;s interest, often with detrimental role to research. Some of these phenomena are addressed in a number of recent initiatives, including the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment.

Guidelines have been written on the using of bibliometrics in academic research, in disciplines such as Management, Education, and Information Science. Other bibliometrics applications include: creating thesauri; measuring term frequencies; as metrics in scientometric analysis, exploring grammatical and syntactical structures of texts; measuring usage by readers; quantifying value of online media of communication; in the context of technological trend analyses; measuring Jaccard distance cluster analysis and text mining based on binary logistic regression.

In the context of the big deal cancellations by several library systems in the world, data analysis tools like Unpaywall Journals are used by libraries to assist with big deal cancellations: libraries can avoid subscriptions for materials already served by instant open access via open archives like PubMed Central.
==Bibliometrics and open science==

The open science movement has been acknowledged as the most important transformation faced by bibliometrics since the emergence of the field in the 1960s. The free sharing of a wide variety of scientific outputs on the web affected the practice of bibliometrics at all levels: the definition and the collection of the data, infrastructure, and metrics.

Before the crystallization of the field around the Science Citation Index and the reductionist theories of Derek de Solla Price, bibliometrics has been largely influenced by utopian projects of enhanced knowledge sharing beyond specialized academic communities. The scientific networks envisioned by Paul Otlet or John Desmond Bernal have gained a new relevancy with the development of the Web: &quot;The philosophical inspiration of the pioneers in pursuing the above lines of inquiry, however, faded gradually into the background (…) Whereas Bernal&#x27;s input would eventually find an ideal continuation in the open access movement, the citation machine set into motion by Garfield and Small led to the proliferation of sectorial studies of a fundamentally empirical nature.&quot;

===From altmetrics to open metrics===

In the early developments, the open science movement partly co-opted the standard tools of bibliometrics and quantitative evaluation: &quot;the fact that no reference was made to metadata in the main OA declarations (Budapest, Berlin, Bethesda) has led to a paradoxical situation (…) it was through the use of the Web of Science that OA advocates were eager to show how much accessibility led to a citation advantage compared to paywalled articles.&quot; After 2000, an important bibliometric literature was devoted to the citation advantage of open access publications.

By the end of the 2000s, the impact factor and other metrics have increasingly held responsible a systemic &quot;locked-in&quot; of prestigious non-accessible sources. Key figures of the open science movement like Stevan Harnad called for the creation of &quot;open access scientometrics&quot; that would take &quot;advantage of the wealth of usage and impact metrics enabled by the multiplication of online, full-text, open access digital archives.&quot; As the public of open science expanded beyond academic circles, new metrics should aim for &quot;measuring the broader societal impacts of scientific research.&quot;

The concept of &quot;alt-metrics&quot; was introduced in 2009 by Cameron Neylon and Shirly Wu as &quot;article-level metrics&quot;. In contrast with the focus of leading metrics on journals (impact factor) or, more recently, on individual researchers (h-index), the article-level metrics makes it possible to track the circulation of individual publications: &quot;(an) article that used to live on a shelf now lives in Mendeley, CiteULike, or Zotero – where we can see and count it&quot; As such they are more compatible with the diversity of publication strategies that has characterized open science: preprints, reports or even non-textual outputs like dataset or software may also have associated metrics. In their original research proposition, Neylon and Wu favored the use of data from reference management software like Zotero or Mendeley. The concept of &quot;altmetrics&quot; evolved and came to encover data extracted &quot;from social media applications, like blogs, Twitter, ResearchGate and Mendeley.&quot;. Social media sources proved especially to be more reliable on a long-term basis, as specialized academic tools like Mendeley came to be integrated into a proprietary ecosystem developed by leading scientific publishers. Major altmetrics indicators that emerged in the 2010s include Altmetric.com, PLUMx and ImpactStory.

As the meaning of altmetrics shifted, the debate over the positive impact of the metrics evolved toward their redefinition in an open science ecosystem: &quot;Discussions on the misuse of metrics and their interpretation put metrics themselves in the center of open science practices.&quot; While altmetrics were initially conceived for open science publications and their expanded circulation beyond academic circles, their compatibility with the emerging requirements for open metrics has been brought into question: social network data, in particular, is far from transparent and readily accessible. In 2016, Ulrich Herb published a systematic assessment of the leading publications&#x27; metrics in regard to open science principles and concluded that &quot;neither citation-based impact metrics nor alternative metrics can be labeled open metrics. They all lack scientific foundation, transparency and verifiability.&quot;

Herb laid an alternative program for open metrics that have yet to be developed. The main criteria included:
* A large selection of publication items (journal articles, books, dataset, software) that agree with the writing and reading practices of scientific communities.
* Fully documented data sources.
* Transparent and reproducible process for the calculation of the metrics and other indices.
* Open software.
* Promotion of reflexive and interpretive uses of the metrics, to prevent their misuse in quantitative assessments.

This definition has been implemented in research programs, like ROSI (&quot;Reference implementation for open scientometric indicators&quot;). In 2017, the European Commission Expert Group on Altmetrics expanded the open metrics program of Ulrich Herb under a new concept, the &quot;Next-generation metrics&quot;. These metrics should be managed by &quot;open, transparent and linked data infrastructure&quot;. The expert group underline that not everything should be measured and not all metrics are relevants: &quot;Measure what matters: the next generation of metrics should begin with those qualities and impacts that European societies most value and need indices for, rather than those which are most easily collected and measure&quot;.

===Infrastructure for open citation data===

Until the 2010s, the impact of open science movement was largely limited to scientific publications: it &quot;has tended to overlook the importance of social structures and systemic constraints in the design of new forms of knowledge infrastructures.&quot; In 1997, Robert D. Cameron called for the development of an open databases of citation that would completely alter the condition of science communication: &quot;Imagine a universal bibliographic and citation database linking every scholarly work ever written—no matter how published—to every work that cites and every work that cites it. Imagine that such a citation database was freely available over the Internet and was updated every day with all the new works published that day, including papers in traditional and electronic journals, conference papers, theses, technical reports, working papers, and preprints.&quot; Despite the development of specific indexes focused on open access works like CiteSeer, a large open alternative to the Science Citation Index failed to materialize. The collection of citation data, remained dominated by large commercial structure such as the direct descendant of the Scientific Citation Index, the Web of Science. This had the effect of maintaining the emerging ecosystem of open resources at the periphery of academic networks: &quot;common pool of resources is not governed or managed by the current scholarly commons initiative. There is no dedicated hard infrastructure and though there may be a nascent community, there is no formal membership.&quot;

Since 2015, open science infrastructures, platforms and journals have converged to the creation of digital academic commons, increasingly structured around a shared ecosystem of services and standards has emerged through the network of dependencies from one infrastructure to another. This movement stem from an increasingly critical stance toward leading proprietary databases. In 2012, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) called for &quot;ending the use of journal impact factors in funding, hiring and promotion decisions.&quot; The Leiden Manifesto for research metrics (2015) encouraged the development of &quot;open, transparent and simple&quot; data collection.

Collaborations between academic and non-academic actors collectively committed in the creation and maintenance of knowledge commons has been a determining factor in the creation of new infrastructure for open citation data. Since 2010, a dataset of open citation data, the &quot;Open Citation Corpus&quot;, has been collected by several researchers from a variety of open access sources (including PLOS and Pubmed). This collection was the initial kernel of the Initiative for OpenCitations, incepted in 2017 in response to issues of data accessibility faced by a Wikimedia project, Wikidata. A conference, given by Dario Taraborelli, head of research at the Wikimedia Foundation showed that only 1% of papers in Crossref had citations metadata that were freely available and references stored on Wikidata were unable to include the very large segment of non-free data. This coverage expanded to more than half of the recorded papers, when Elsevier finally joined the initiative in January 2021.

Since 2021, OpenAlex has become a major open infrastructure for scientific metadata. Initially created as a replacement for the discontinued &quot;Microsoft Academic Graph&quot;, OpenAlex indexed in 2022 209 millions of scholarly works from 213 millions authors as well as their associated institutions, venues and concepts in a knowledge graph integrated into the semantic web (and Wikidata). Due to its large coverage and large amount of data properly migrated from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG), OpenAlex &quot;seems to be at least as suited for bibliometric analyses as MAG for publication years before 2021.&quot; In 2023, a study on the coverage of data journals in scientific indexes found that OpenAlex, along with Dimensions, &quot;enjoy a strong advantage over the two more traditional databases, WoS and Scopus&quot; and is overall especially suited for the indexation of non-journal publications like books or from researchers in non-western countries

The opening of science data has been a major topic of debate in the bibliometrics and scientometrics community and had wide range social and intellectual consequences. In 2019, the entire scientific board of the &quot;Journal of Infometrics&quot; resigned and created a new open access journals, &quot;Quantitative Science Studies&quot;. The journal was published by Elsevier since 2007 and the members of the board were increasingly critical of the lack of progress in the open sharing of open citation data: &quot;Our field depends on high-quality scientific metadata. To make our science more robust and reproducible, these data must be as open as possible. Therefore, our editorial board was deeply concerned with the refusal of Elsevier to participate in the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC).&quot;

===Bibliometrics without evaluation: the shift to quantitative science studies===
The unprecedented availability of a wide range of scientific productions (publications, data, software, conference, reviews...) has entailed a more dramatic redefinition of the bibliometrics project. For new alternative works anchored in the open science landscape, the principles of bibliometrics as defined by Garfield and Price in the 1960s need to be rethought. The pre-selection of a limited corpus of important journals seem neither necessary nor appropriate. In 2019, the proponents of the Matilda project, &quot;do not want to just &quot;open&quot; the existing closed information, but wish to give back a fair place to the whole academic content that has been excluded from such tools, in a &quot;all texts are born equal&quot; fashion.&quot; They aim to &quot;redefine bibliometrics tools as a technology&quot; by focusing on the exploration and mapping of scientific corpus.

Issues of inclusivity and more critical approach of structural inequalities in science have become more prevalent in scientometrics and bibliometrics, especially in relation to gender imbalance. After 2020, one of the most heated debate in the field revolved around the reception of a study on the gender imbalance in fundamental physics.

The structural shift in the definition of bibliometrics, scientometrics or infometrics has entailed the need for alternative labels. The concept of &quot;Quantitative Science Studies&quot; was originally introduced in the late 2000s in the context of a renewed critical assessment of classic bibliometric findings. It has become more prevalent in the late 2010s. After leaving Elsevier, the editors of the &quot;Journal of Infometrics&quot; opted for this new label and created a journal for &quot;Quantitative Science Studies&quot;. The first editorial removed all references to metric and aimed for a wider inclusion of quantitative and qualitative research on the science of science:

<text>Graham Thomson Lyall VC (8 March 1892 – 28 November 1941) was an English-born soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He received the award for his actions on the Western Front in the final months of the war, while serving as an infantry officer. After the war, Lyall remained in the United Kingdom and returned to civilian life. Throughout the inter-war years, he served in the Territorial Army, in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, and during the Second World War, he served in the British Army. He died of a heart attack at the age of 49, while on active service in Egypt.

==Early life==
Lyall was born on 8 March 1892 in the village of Chorlton, near Manchester. His father, R. H. Lyall, was a reverend and in 1894, moved his family to Farnworth when he became vicar at St. John&#x27;s Church. The family moved again in 1900, to Nelson in Lancashire, where Lyall attended Nelson Municipal Secondary School. He then went on to study mechanical engineering at a naval college.

In 1912, after completing his college studies, Lyall emigrated to Canada and settled in Welland, Ontario. He went to Toronto University to further his education and then became a mechanical engineer. A member of the British Institute of Engineers, he worked firstly for a steel foundry and then the Canadian Niagara Power Company, based at Niagara Falls.

==First World War==
Lyall joined the Canadian Militia in October 1914, and was posted to the 19th Lincoln Regiment. He served as a guard on the canal at Niagara for several months before enlisting in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. After being shipped to England, he was posted to the 81st Battalion in October 1915 and was quickly made an acting corporal. Arriving on the Western Front in France in 1916, he participated in the Battle of the Somme and then the Battle of Vimy Ridge.

Having received further promotions, Lyall was selected for officer training and sent to the Canadian Officer&#x27;s Training School in Sussex. After being commissioned in April 1917, Lyall was posted to the 102nd Battalion. As part of the Canadian 4th Division, Lyall&#x27;s battalion was involved in the Battle of the Canal du Nord on 27 September 1918. Advancing against German forces in Boulon Wood, his platoon was held up by a series of strong points but due to his leadership, these were all overcome. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read:

Lyall was presented with the VC by King George V in March 1919.

==Later life==
Rather than return to Canada after being discharged from the CEF, Lyall remained in the United Kingdom. In April 1919, he married Elizabeth Moffat and the couple settled in Airdrie in Scotland. He became a manager at a brickworks before taking up a directorship of a construction firm in Airdrie. He retained an interest in the military and served in the Territorial Army. By 1939 he was a major with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) and commanding the workshop company of 3 Anti-Aircraft Division.

After the outbreak of the Second World War, Lyall was mobilised and his company based at Stirling, with the division responsible for the defence of central Scotland. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in May 1940, he volunteered to serve overseas. He was posted to the Middle East where he posted to the RAOC&#x27;s No. 2 Base Ordnance Workshop at Tel El Kebir in Egypt. The following year he was promoted to colonel and took command of the 87th Lines of Communication. His area of responsibility was west of Mersa Matruh, supporting the frontline troops. He died of a heart attack on 28 November 1941 and is buried at the Halfaya Sollum War Cemetery in Egypt.

== Medal and legacy==

In 2003, Lyall&#x27;s Victoria Cross, together with his campaign medals from the First and Second World Wars was loaned to the REME Museum of Technology in Arborfield, Berkshire, on the wishes of his widow. The VC was subsequently returned to the family and a replica is displayed at the museum. A plaque in his memory is located in the city of St. Catharines in Niagara. There is also a memorial plaque to Lyall in Manchester, the city of his birth.

<text>Ong&#x27;s Hat (also Ong) is a ghost town in Pemberton Township, Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located on Magnolia Road (County Route 644) west of the Four Mile Circle, where New Jersey Route 72 intersects with New Jersey Route 70. It is the northern terminus of the Batona Trail.

Although it was never more than one hut (&quot;Ong&#x27;s Hut&quot;), it still appeared on some maps as of 2006. A road in the area is named Ong&#x27;s Hat Road. It is also called the Buddtown-Ong&#x27;s Hat Road. It was completed in 1929, replacing an earlier dirt path.

==Name==
The name of the place may have originally been Ong&#x27;s Hut, referring to an overnight shelter built by a farmer of that name; see below.

A well-known folk story attributes the name to a local man who was a fixture at local dances, wooing women with his suave attire, especially his silk hat. The surname Ong was common among early Pine Barrens settlers, and one of the earliest settlers was named Jacob Ong. One story of the origin of the name is that at one such dance, a jealous lover stomped on his hat, ruining it, and in frustration Ong tossed it in the air, where it caught on a high branch of a pine tree. The hat remained there for many years, serving as landmark which identified the small village. At least four other versions of this legend circulate. One version simply ends with his hat being stomped on, while the most widely circulated one ends with him throwing it in the tree. The other two hold that Ong was a tavern keeper who either painted a silk hat on his sign or threw his hat into a tree after getting angry with a woman.

==History==
The name of the area predates the revolutionary war. The location &quot;Ong&#x27;s&quot; appears on a 1778 map of Hessian encampments in New Jersey.
According to &quot;Forgotten Towns of Southern New Jersey&quot; by Henry Charlton Beck, Ong&#x27;s Hat was a real village. According to Beck, around the 1860s, Ong&#x27;s Hat was a lively town and served as a social center for the surrounding area. It was known for the availability of alcohol and one of the first arrests of a bootlegger occurred at Ong&#x27;s Hat. Prizefighting was also popular.

Beck says that a Polish couple, the Chininiskis, moved to Ong&#x27;s Hat in the early 20th century. By that time only seven residents remained. The Chininiskis disappeared soon after. Years later, hunters found a female skeleton at Ong&#x27;s Hat, which police speculated was that of Mrs. Chininiski. Tracking Mr. Chininiski to New York but unable to prove anything, Burlington County Sheriff Ellis Parker kept the skull in his office for many years as a reminder of the unsolved case.

By 1936, Ong&#x27;s Hat was still on maps but nothing was there except a clearing, an abandoned shed, and bits of brick and roofing suggesting houses had once been there. When Beck visited he found only Eli Freed, a 79-year-old farmer who moved to the area from Chicago. In the foreword to the 1961 edition of the book, Beck reports that Freed no longer lived at Ong&#x27;s Hat and that additional legends concerning the village had emerged.

 A 1968 letter published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, written by an Ong family descendant, claims reports of an actual town are a misnomer. Instead, he says his ancestors lived in Little Egg Harbor in the early 17th century and transported their grain to Burlington, New Jersey for grinding. They built a hut midway through the route where they could rest overnight, and according to the letter the name Ong&#x27;s Hut was added to maps and gradually corrupted to Ong&#x27;s Hat.

In his 1944 book &quot;Jersey Genesis&quot;, Beck himself says in reporting on Ong&#x27;s Hat he fell for &quot;elaborate traps&quot; and that the story he had earlier repeated was a &quot;fairy tale&quot;. He then subscribes to the explanation that the name is a corruption of Ong&#x27;s Hut, a stopover point for a farmer from Little Egg Harbor.

==Urban legend==

The town of Ong&#x27;s Hat was the setting for a series of fictional conspiracy theory themed stories from the 1980s onwards, known as &quot;Ong&#x27;s Hat&quot;, in which a group of scientists was able to travel to a parallel dimension from a site in the township.

The story originated in Joseph Matheny’s book, &quot;The Incunabula Papers: Ong&#x27;s Hat And Other Gateways To New Dimensions&quot;. In his book, written in the first person, he tells the story of an investigative journalist trying to uncover the truth about the mysterious town, detailing everything that is happening there.

Matheny intended the book to be entertaining and viewed as a work of fiction, but many regarded the stories as factual evidence of a scientific conspiracy, with Matheny&#x27;s denials being a result of government persecution.

<text>A primary alcohol is an alcohol in which the hydroxy group is bonded to a primary carbon atom. It can also be defined as a molecule containing a “–CH2OH” group.
In contrast, a secondary alcohol has a formula “–CHROH” and a tertiary alcohol has a formula “–CR2OH”, where “R” indicates a carbon-containing group.

Examples of primary alcohols include ethanol and 1-butanol.

Methanol is also generally regarded as a primary alcohol, including by the 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica.

<text>Frank Lester VC (18 February 1896 – 12 October 1918) was an English soldier in the British Army during the First World War, and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy awarded to British Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Lester was born on 18 February 1896 in Huyton, near Liverpool, to John and Ellen Lester, Prior to becoming a soldier, he was the organist at the Methodist chapel in Irby. He enlisted in the army in March 1916 and was posted to the 10th Battalion of the South Lancashire Regiment. He was soon promoted to the rank of Sergeant Instructor, training recruits at Prees Heath, Shropshire and Kinmel Park, North Wales. In June 1917 he was transferred at his own request to the Lancashire Fusiliers and in December that year he was drafted to France with the 10th Battalion of that regiment. In going overseas he relinquished the rank of Sergeant Instructor and reverted to Private.

In the winter of 1918, now promoted to corporal, Lester was wounded during the massive German offensive and was sent to Rouen for treatment. On leaving hospital he returned to England to await another posting. After some leave he was sent to Cromer, Norfolk and in September was sent back to the front in France.

==Victoria Cross==
Lester was part of the British offensive which was steadily pushing the German front line back. They encountered stiff resistance, the Germans were determined to prevent a rout of the &quot;impregnable&quot; Hindenburg Line and fighting for survival. It was 12 October 1918, in driving rain and sleet, that the 22 year-old corporal in the 10th Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers performed a deed for which he was awarded the VC.
==Legacy==
He is at buried in row B, grave 15 in Neuvilly Communal Cemetery Extension, France, located three miles north of Le Cateau. He is also commemorated on the family memorial in the graveyard of the former Holy Trinity Church, Wirral, and on the War Memorial in the graveyard of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, Thurstaston.

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<doc id="1223281" wikidata="Q3612641" url="?curid=1223281" title="Montrose Regional Airport">
<text>Montrose Regional Airport is a non-towered public airport on the northwest side of Montrose, in zip code 81401 in southwestern Colorado. Its two runways are at elevation 5,759 feet (1,755 m). MTJ covers 966 acres (391 ha) of land.

Monarch Airlines started flying to Montrose in the 1940s. Successor Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) flew to the present airport since the 1950s; the first jets were Frontier Boeing 737-200s in 1982 (runway 12/30 was then 8500 ft). Earlier, Frontier flew Convair 580s between Montrose and Denver.

An enhanced and expanded Montrose Regional Airport was dedicated on June 25, 1988, with Chuck Yeager cutting the ribbon. 
The airport terminal was designed by local architect Patrik Davis &quot;to greet visitors with small-town hospitality. A two-sided fireplace is the centerpiece of the passenger seating area, which has a tile floor patterned with the Ute pictogram for travel and a high, skylighted ceiling of knotty pine. The walls are earthy, ground-face cinderblock, and natural-finished glue-laminated beams extend over wide walkways. The gable roof has skylights and dormers decorated with the Hopi good luck symbol.&quot;

Its runway 17/35 (10,000 feet in length) was built during the 1990s.

The airport is most busy during its winter season, serving many skiers headed to Telluride Ski Resort, an hour and a half away by road; it is also busy serving summer tourism in the area. Outside the winter and summer seasons, the only major airline flights are United Express and Southwest Airlines flights to Denver and American Eagle flights to Dallas/Fort Worth. Direct flights to Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Houston, San Francisco and Atlanta are offered in peak seasons, with the most flights on Saturdays.

Montrose Regional is the nearest airport with regularly scheduled mainline passenger jets to ski areas around Telluride. Some direct service to Telluride&#x27;s small airport is offered by Denver Air Connection, with Montrose serving as the alternative, backup destination when weather would close the high-elevation Telluride airport.

In the year ending December 31, 2022, the airport had 23,414 aircraft operations, average 64 per day: 26% air carrier, 1% air taxi, 72% general aviation and 1% military. At the time, there were 93 aircraft based at MTJ, 70 single-engine, 13 multi-engine, 3 jets, 3 helicopters, 3 gliders and 1 ultra-light.

==Major accidents near MTJ==
*On April 13, 1973, a Continental Airlines North American Sabreliner on a positioning flight crashed shortly after takeoff when a thrust reverser deployed in flight. Both occupants on board were killed.
*On November 28, 2004, a Global Aviation Canadair CL-600 with six occupants on board crashed shortly after takeoff due to ice and snow contamination on the wings. Two crew members and one passenger, the son of Dick Ebersol and Susan Saint James, died.
