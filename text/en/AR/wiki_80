<text>Berlin is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,489, a decrease of 99 (−1.3%) from the 2010 census count of 7,588, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,439 (+23.4%) from the 6,149 counted in the 2000 census.

Berlin was incorporated as a borough on March 29, 1927, from portions of Berlin Township, based on the results of a referendum held on April 26, 1927.

== History ==
What is now Berlin was known in earlier times as &quot;Longacoming.&quot; The Lenape Native Americans used Lonaconing Trail to describe the travel route that ran through the area, connecting the Jersey Shore to the Delaware River. Another tradition cites early European visitors who found a stream at the head of the Great Egg Harbor River and appreciated the respite as being &quot;long a coming&quot;.
Long-a-Coming became a stopping point for stagecoaches located at the halfway point between Philadelphia and Atlantic City. Upon the creation of Camden County in 1844, it was briefly named the county seat (while the area was still a part of Waterford Township), until 1848 when the seat moved to the city of Camden. A rail line was laid in 1853. Three years later, the Long-a-Coming railroad station was built. In February 1867, the station was renamed &quot;Magnolia&quot;. This caused confusion because there was a community called Magnolia nearby. Three months later, the station&#x27;s name changed to Berlin. The name &quot;Berlin&quot; may have been chosen as a reference to the city of Berlin in Germany, though the derivation is uncertain.

The Council has legislative and policy-making power. It elects a Council President annually to preside in the Mayor&#x27;s absence. The Mayor appoints Council members to serve as liaisons to the Recreation Committee, Finance Committee, Athletic Association, Public Works, Special Events, School Board, Public Safety and Senior Citizens. The Mayor and one council member are members of the Planning and Zoning Board.

A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.

<text>Clementon is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 5,338, an increase of 338 (+6.8%) from the 2010 census count of 5,000, which in turn reflected an increase of 14 (+0.3%) from the 4,986 counted in the 2000 census.

The borough had the 27th-highest property tax rate in New Jersey, with an equalized rate of 4.179% in 2020, compared to 3.470% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==History==
Around 1800, Jonathon Haines built a glass factory in what is now Clementon, situated on a large hill across the street from the modern day Clementon Park. Large amounts of dirt, gravel and marl from the large hill the glass works were situated on were removed for use at a planned new post office in 1961. Sometime around 1811, Samuel Clement of Haddonfield purchased the glass works and named them the Gloucester Glass works, and named the small settlement around the plant as Clementon village. Haines remained as a superintendent and at some point repurchased the works from Clement.

The Borough of Clementon was created on February 13, 1925, from Clementon Township, one of nine municipalities created from the now-defunct township, based on the results of a referendum held on March 17, 1925.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.95 square miles (5.05 km2), including 1.89 square miles (4.90 km2) of land and 0.06 square miles (0.15 km2) of water (2.97%).

The borough is located on Clementon Lake, which is the site of the Clementon Amusement Park. The amusement park was home to the Jack Rabbit, a wooden roller coaster constructed in 1919 by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. Though quite tame in comparison to modern steel coasters, it remained popular with park visitors. It was one of the oldest remaining coasters in the country when it was taken out of service in 2002 and ultimately demolished in 2007.

Rowands Pond Wildlife Management Area, covering , is located in Clementon.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Brownsville and Gordon Lake.

<text>Collingswood is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located east of Center City Philadelphia. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 14,186, an increase of 260 (+1.9%) from the 2010 census count of 13,926, which in turn reflected a decline of 400 (−2.8%) from the 14,326 counted in the 2000 census.

Owing in part to its Quaker history, Collingswood was founded as a dry town where alcohol cannot be sold, however restaurant patrons are permitted to bring their own wine and beer to consume. In July 2015, the town introduced an ordinance that allows craft breweries to operate in the town but not serve food. The ordinance passed in August 2015.

==History==
The land in what is present day Collingswood was originally inhabited by Lenape Native Americans. Quakers from England and Ireland settled along Newton Creek and Cooper River in the late 17th century, establishing what was known as the Newton Colony and eventually Newton Township. Much of what is now Collingswood was a farm owned by members of the Collings family during the 18th and 19th centuries. Later a section of Haddon Township, Collingswood was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 22, 1888, based on the results of a referendum held that same day. That same year, town resident Edward Collings Knight, a wealthy sugar, real estate and railroad magnate, donated the land that became Knight Park. Knight was a descendant of the Collings family for whom the borough is named.

Collingswood has several historic homes including the 1820s-era house of the Collings family, known as the Collings-Knight homestead, which stands at the corner of Browning Road and Collings Avenue, shadowed by the Parkview at Collingswood apartment homes. The Stokes-Lees mansion located in the 600 block of Lees Avenue dates back to 1707, making it one of the oldest houses in Camden County. Sections of Harleigh Cemetery, the location of poet Walt Whitman&#x27;s tomb, are in Collingswood.

<text>Gloucester Township is a township in Camden County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township was the state&#x27;s 22nd-most-populous municipality, with a population was 66,034, an increase of 1,400 (+2.2%) from the 2010 census count of 64,634, which in turn reflected an increase of 284 (+0.4%) from the 64,350 counted in the 2000 census. The township had been ranked as the 19th-most populous municipality in the state in 2010 after having been ranked 18th in 2000.

Gloucester Township was formed on June 1, 1695, while the area was still part of Gloucester County. It was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s first 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. When Camden County was established on March 13, 1844, it was included in that county. Over time, pieces of the township were taken to create Winslow Township (March 8, 1845), Clementon Township (February 24, 1903; dissolved on May 16, 1941; became Laurel Springs), and Union Township (November 15, 1831; dissolved on February 25, 1868, with remaining land chartered as Gloucester City). The township is part of South Jersey and constitutes part of the larger Philadelphia metropolitan area.

== History ==
Present Gloucester Township was one of the original townships that comprised old Gloucester County. It became the county&#x27;s first political subdivision in 1685. The boundaries of Gloucester County extended from the Delaware River to the Atlantic Ocean until 1683, when it was divided into two townships; Egg Harbor Township and Gloucester Township, which took its name from the cathedral city of Gloucester on the banks of the River Severn in England. Gloucester Township further subdivided into four smaller townships, and on June 1, 1695, became one of the first New Jersey municipalities to incorporate. In 1844, the township became part of newly formed Camden County.

The Gabreil Daveis Tavern House, located at 4th Avenue in Glendora, is a pre-Revolutionary War tavern that was built in 1756 and for many years served as an inn for boatmen who transported their products to Philadelphia via nearby Big Timber Creek. It was recently restored and now serves as Gloucester Township&#x27;s historical centerpiece. This building has also been referred to as the Hillman Hospital House because it was designated a hospital by George Washington during the Revolution. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is open to visitors on Sunday afternoons from April through December, excepting holidays.

<text>Gloucester City is a city in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 11,484, an increase of 28 (+0.2%) from the 2010 census count of 11,456, which in turn reflected a decline of 28 (−0.2%) from the 11,484 counted in the 2000 census. It is located directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia and the Port of Philadelphia.

Gloucester City was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 25, 1868, from the remaining portions of Union Township, which was then dissolved. Additional territory was annexed in 1925 from Centre Township and in 1927 from Haddon Township. The city&#x27;s name derives from Gloucester, England.

Gloucester City is known for its Irish American population, which was ninth-highest in the United States by percentage in the 2000 Census.

The city had the 23rd-highest property tax rate in New Jersey, with an equalized rate of 4.343% in 2020, compared to 3.470% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==History==
The name Fort Nassau was used by the Dutch in the 17th century for several fortifications, mostly trading stations, named for the House of Orange-Nassau. The one built in the 1620s at today&#x27;s Gloucester City was for trade, mostly in beaver pelts, with the indigenous population of Susquehannock and Lenape. The region along the Delaware River and its bay was called the Zuyd Rivier and marked the southern flank of the province of New Netherland.

From 1638 to 1655 the area was part of New Sweden, which had been established by Peter Minuit, who had been Director of New Netherland, and was responsible for the famous purchase of the island of Manhattan. The location was disadvantageous since the richest fur-trapping area was on the west side of the river, where Swedish could intercept trade with the natives. In 1651, Peter Stuyvesant, director-general of New Netherland, dismantled the structure and relocated to a position on the other side of the river, in part to menace the Swedish, calling it Fort Casimir.

After the arrival of English Quakers on the Delaware, in 1677, a permanent settlement, at first called Axwamus, was established on the site of the present city. This was surveyed and laid out as a town in 1689. In 1868 it was chartered as a city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 2.76 square miles (7.15 km2), including 2.31 square miles (5.98 km2) of land and 0.45 square miles (1.17 km2) of water (16.41%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Cloversdale, Gloucester Heights, Highland Park and Newbold.

The city borders the municipalities of Bellmawr, Brooklawn, Camden, Haddon Township, and Mount Ephraim. Gloucester City also borders Westville in Gloucester County and the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, across the Delaware River.

<text>Haddon Township is a township in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 15,407, an increase of 700 (+4.8%) from the 2010 census count of 14,707, which in turn reflected an increase of 56 (+0.4%) from the 14,651 counted in the 2000 census.

Under the terms of an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 23, 1865, Haddon Township was incorporated from portions of Newton Township. The following communities were subsequently created from the Haddon Township: Haddonfield (April 6, 1875), Collingswood (May 22, 1888), Woodlynne (March 19, 1901), Haddon Heights (March 2, 1904), Audubon (March 13, 1905) and Oaklyn (also March 13, 1905). The township was named for early settler Elizabeth Haddon.

Haddon Township allows the sale of alcohol, and has several bars and restaurants which serve alcoholic beverages, unlike the neighboring boroughs of Collingswood, Haddonfield and Haddon Heights which prohibit the sale of alcohol.

== History ==
The township&#x27;s first European settlers settled in the area of Newton Creek in 1681. In 1701, Elizabeth Haddon Estaugh, the daughter of John Haddon, arrived in the American colonies to oversee his large landholdings, which included areas that are now Collingswood, Haddon Township, and Haddonfield. Contemporary Newton Township included land that later became part of Audubon, Audubon Park, Camden, Collingswood, Gloucester City, Haddon Heights, Haddonfield, Oaklyn, and Woodlynne.

=== Saddlertown ===
In the late 1830s, a runaway enslaved man, who had taken the surname Saddler to avoid detection by his former master, came to New Jersey from a Maryland plantation with his wife and two daughters. Saddler worked for Cy Evans, a local Quaker farmer, from whom he bought five acres to farm. The area where Saddler settled became a predominantly black community known as Saddlertown, a stop on the Underground Railroad. Today, Saddlertown is racially diverse.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Haddon Township had a total area of 2.82 square miles (7.30 km2), including 2.69 square miles (6.97 km2) of land and 0.13 square miles (0.33 km2) of water (4.54%).

Haddon Township has two exclaves, West Collingswood Heights and West Collingswood Extension. The downtown portion of the township is known as Westmont, a name probably derived from a noted harness racing horse. Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Crystal Lake, Cuthbert and Oakdale.

Haddon Township borders the Camden County municipalities of Audubon, Audubon Park, Camden, Cherry Hill (water border), Collingswood, Gloucester City, Haddonfield, Mount Ephraim, and Oaklyn.

== Government ==
===Local government===
Since 1950, Haddon Township has been governed under the Walsh Act with a governing body comprised of a three-member commission. The Township is one of 30 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under the commission form of government. Commission members are elected at-large on a non-partisan basis as part of the May municipal election to serve four-year concurrent terms of office. At a reorganization meeting held after the election, each commissioner is assigned responsibility for supervising a specific department. The commissioners select one of their members to serve as a part-time mayor, who presides over meetings but has no independent executive function. Haddon Township has had only three mayors in its history: William Rohrer, William J. Park. Jr., (1997 New Jersey State League of Municipalities Mayors Hall of Fame), and Randall Teague.

, members of the Haddon Township Commission are 
Mayor Randall W. &quot;Randy&quot; Teague (Commissioner of Public Works, Parks and Public Property), 
Ryan Linhart (Commissioner of Revenue and Finance) and 
Jim Mulroy (Commissioner of Public Affairs and Public Safety); all serving terms of office that end May 16, 2027. Linhart, Mulroy and Teague ran unopposed in the May 2023 municipal election, the fourth consecutive time that township candidates won election to four-year terms, without facing any challengers.

In November 2018, Ryan Linhart was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Paul Dougherty, who resigned the previous month before he pleaded guilty to a criminal charge.

Jim Mulroy was sworn into office in February 2017 to fill the seat vacated by John Foley, who resigned from office earlier that month.

<text>Haddon Heights is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,495, an increase of 22 (+0.3%) from the 2010 census count of 7,473, which in turn reflected a decline of 74 (−1.0%) from the 7,547 counted in the 2000 census.

Haddon Heights was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 2, 1904, from portions of the now-defunct Centre Township and parts of Haddon Township. The borough was named for Elizabeth Haddon, an early settler of the area. Haddon Heights is a dry town where alcohol cannot be sold. A November 2024 non-binding referendum asking voters to allow liquor sales at restaurants and bars in the borough passed by a 2–1 margin; the borough council would have to approve an ordinance allowing for the sale of liquor licenses.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Haddon Heights as the 98th best place to live in New Jersey in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey, and the borough has also been listed among its &quot;Classic Towns of Greater Philadelphia&quot; by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. In 2011, &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; named Haddon Heights the second best town to live in Southern New Jersey, after Moorestown Township.

==History==

The land that was to become Haddon Heights was settled in 1699 by John Hinchman. In 1713, John Siddon built a farmhouse near Hinchman&#x27;s property. John Thorn Glover dammed King&#x27;s Run and constructed a mill race and fulling mill on this property before 1776. Jacob Hinchman built a frame dwelling no later than 1720 that was later enlarged by American Revolutionary War hero Col. Joseph Ellis. It is currently referred to as the Col. Joseph Ellis House. New Jersey governor Joseph Bloomfield later purchased this property.
In 1890, Benjamin A. Lippincott constructed a passenger station in the center of his land for the Atlantic City Railroad. Then Lippincott, with Charles Hillman, filed a grid street plan with Camden County to develop a community. They named it Haddon Heights because of its proximity to Haddonfield and its high elevation. Large houses were built in Colonial Revival, Queen Anne or Foursquare style that appealed to prosperous middle-class families moving from the cities. In 1904, Haddon Heights was incorporated as a borough and Lippincott was elected mayor. A small downtown grew near the railroad and the White Horse Pike and eight churches and a synagogue were built. An area of old Centre Township, known as Fairfield Estates, voted in 1926 to become part of Haddon Heights. This land was developed for more single-family housing through the 1940s and 1950s. Even though rail passenger service was suspended in July 1965, Haddon Heights remains a typical turn-of-the-twentieth-century railroad suburb with tree-shaded streets and comfortable homes.

==Government==

===Local government===
Haddon Heights is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council has six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Haddon Heights is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body, with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

The reorganization meeting of the governing body is held on the first Saturday in January. At this meeting, the newly elected council members take the oath of office and a council president, who serves as acting mayor when the mayor is absent, is elected by the council. Appointments for the coming year are announced by the mayor and confirmed by the council when required by law.

, the mayor of Haddon Heights is Democrat Zachary Houck, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Christopher Morgan (D, 2024), Trisha D.

<text>Haddonfield is a borough located in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 12,550, an increase of 957 (+8.3%) from the 2010 census count of 11,593, which in turn reflected a decline of 66 (−0.6%) from the 11,659 counted in the 2000 census

Haddonfield was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 6, 1875, within portions of Haddon Township following a referendum on the same day. The borough became an independent municipality in 1894. The borough was named for Elizabeth Haddon, an early settler of the area.

== History ==
The Haddonfield area was occupied by the Lenape Native American tribe, but they largely disappeared from the area when settlers arrived. Arrowheads and pottery shards have been found by residents by the banks of the Cooper River, hinting that there was a Native American settlement in Haddonfield at one point in time.
On October 23, 1682, Francis Collins, an English Quaker and a bricklayer by trade, became the first settler within the boundaries of what today is Haddonfield. Collins soon built a house, &quot;Mountwell,&quot; on a tract of . Haddonfield was further developed by Elizabeth Haddon (1680–1762), whose Quaker father, John Haddon, bought a tract of land in the English colony of West Jersey to escape religious persecution. Elizabeth set sail alone from Southwark, England to the New World in 1701. Shortly after her arrival, she made a marriage proposal to John Estaugh, a Quaker minister, and they were married in 1702. The town was named for John Haddon, though he never came to America.

The Indian King Tavern, built in 1750, played a significant role in the American Revolutionary War. During that war, the New Jersey Legislature met there, avoiding British forces, and in 1777, declared New Jersey to be an independent state. Today the tavern is a state historical site and museum. Nevertheless, since 1873, Haddonfield has been a dry town where alcohol cannot be sold though it can be brewed and distributed in town.

Haddonfield is a significant historic paleontology site. In 1838, William Estaugh Hopkins uncovered large bones in a marl pit in which he was digging. Hopkins displayed the bones at his home, Birdwood; and these bones sparked the interest of a visitor, William Foulke. In 1858, Foulke dug from the marl pit the first relatively complete skeleton of a dinosaur found in North America, &quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot;. The skeleton was assembled in 1868 and is still displayed at Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. A long bronze sculpture of “Haddy”, by sculptor John Giannotti, stands in the center of town. Hadrosaurus was recognized officially as the state dinosaur of New Jersey in June 1991.

In 1875, Haddonfield became the first community to secede from Haddon Township and become a self-governing borough. Haddonfield is noted for its historic homes, quaint shops, and legions of lawyers. As a legal center for southern New Jersey, the town houses the offices of more than 390 attorneys.

Haddonfield once was home to Symphony in C (formerly the Haddonfield Symphony), which is now based in nearby Collingswood, and performs at the Gordon Theater at Rutgers University-Camden.

Haddonfield is home to the second oldest volunteer fire company in continuous service in the United States. Haddon Fire Company No. 1 was established as Friendship Fire Company on March 8, 1764, by 26 townsmen. Each member was to furnish two leather buckets while the company supplied six ladders and three fire hooks.

In 1971, Haddonfield became the second municipality in New Jersey (after Cape May) to establish a historic preservation district. In keeping with the historic appearance of the borough, some candidates for commissioner distribute colored ribbons to their supporters instead of yard signs.

== Geography ==

===Bodies of water===
*Driscoll Pond, contained by a small wooden dam, is below Hopkins Pond, and Hopkins Pond flows into it. Driscoll Pond is part of the Hopkins Pond park.
*Hopkins Pond is contained by a large earthen dam, and Hopkins Lane is built atop it. In recent years, local officials have raised concerns about the pond being contaminated with cyanobacteria that can produce toxic algae blooms.
*Evans Pond is part of Wallworth Park and located above Wallworth Lake with a dam separating the two. Formerly Evans Pond was deep enough for small boats to sail on it.
*Wallworth Lake, in Wallworth Park, is below Evans Pond, and contained by another dam.

The governing body is comprised of three commissioners, who elected to concurrent four-year terms of office on a non-partisan basis as part of the May municipal elections. At a reorganization meeting held after the new council is seated, each Commissioner is assigned to oversee one of the three departments within the Borough and the Commissioners select a Mayor and may select a Deputy Mayor.

<doc id="125085" wikidata="Q1083685" url="?curid=125085" title="Hi-Nella, New Jersey">
<text>Hi-Nella is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough is the state&#x27;s ninth-smallest municipality. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 927, an increase of 57 (+6.6%) from the 2010 census count of 870, which in turn reflected a decline of 159 (−15.5%) from the 1,029 counted in the 2000 census.

The Borough of Hi-Nella was created on April 23, 1929, from portions of Clementon Township, as one of seven municipalities created from the now-defunct township, and one of five new municipalities (joining Lindenwold, Pine Hill, Pine Valley and Somerdale) created on that same date. The borough&#x27;s name is traditionally said to derive from a Native American term meaning &quot;high rolling knoll&quot; or &quot;high ground&quot;, though it may have been named for Nella, the wife of Lucious Parker, who developed Hi-Nella Estates in the late 1920s.

&quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; included Hi-Nella in its 2010 series of articles covering &quot;Towns that Shouldn&#x27;t Exist&quot;, citing the borough&#x27;s small area, population and staff, along with its use of a double-wide trailer as a municipal building. Mayor Meredith Dobbs told &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; that efforts to force the borough to consolidate with its neighbors would be &quot;declared dead on arrival&quot;.

The borough had the fifth-highest property tax rate in New Jersey, with an equalized rate of 5.306% in 2020, compared to 3.470% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.22 square miles (0.58 km2), all of which was land.

Hi-Nella borders the Camden County municipalities of Gloucester Township, Somerdale and Stratford.

The borough form of government used by Hi-Nella is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Hi-Nella is Democrat Michael J. Segeren, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Borough Council are Jose A. Class (R, 2024), Cindy McCoy (D, 2023), Kris Muska (I, 2024), Harry Uber (R, 2023) and Robert Wise (D, 2025).

==Education==
Hi-Nella is a non-operating school district. For pre-kindergarten through eighth grade, public school students from Hi-Nella attend school in Stratford as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Stratford School District that was phased in over a five-year period starting in the 2012–13 school year. As of the 2022–23 school year, the district, comprised of two schools, had an enrollment of 901 students and 78.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.6:1. Schools in the district (with 2022–23 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Parkview Elementary School with 384 students in pre-kindergarten through third grade and 
Samuel S. Yellin Elementary School with 507 students in grades 4 through 8.

Prior to the 2012–13 changeover, Hi-Nella students in K–8 had attended the Oaklyn Public School District. With Hi-Nella ending its sending/receiving relationship under a phase-out that would see all Hi-Nella students out of Oaklyn&#x27;s school by 2016–17, the Oaklyn district saw overall enrollment decline from 469 in 2011–12 to 384 in 2014–15, resulting in the loss of tuition revenue that had accounted for as much as 10% of Oaklyn&#x27;s budget, causing significant strain on the district&#x27;s budget.

For ninth grade through twelfth grade, public school students attend Sterling High School, a regional high school district that serves students from Magnolia, Somerdale and Stratford, along with the sending districts of Hi-Nella and Laurel Springs. The high school is located in Somerdale. As of the 2022–23 school year, the high school had an enrollment of 894 students and 70.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.8:1.
Prior to the establishment of the sending agreement with Sterling in 1996, Hi-Nella students had attended Collingswood High School, which is much further away from Hi-Nella.

<text>Lawnside is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Lawnside was developed in 1840 and incorporated in 1926 as the first independent, self-governing Black municipality north of the Mason–Dixon line. The United Parcel Service has a large depot in the borough. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 2,955, an increase of 10 (+0.3%) from the 2010 census count of 2,945, which in turn reflected an increase of 253 (+9.4%) from the 2,692 counted in the 2000 census.

In 2021, the borough had the 25th-highest property tax rate in New Jersey, with an equalized rate of 4.213% in 2020, compared to 3.470% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==History==
Lawnside has been home to African Americans since the late 18th century. Methodist gatherings were established by 1797, and in 1811, Bishop Richard Allen of Philadelphia founded the local African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), which eventually became the Mount Pisgah AME Church today. AME churches were premised on abolition and civil rights, primarily serving former slaves and their descendants. Additionally, freedmen often sought safety and support by concentrating near Quaker allies, which in the case of Lawnside was the Haddonfield Quaker Society of Friends, with support from the Gloucester County Abolition Society and Vigilant Association of Philadelphia. In 1840, these latter abolitionists further advanced the settlement by purchasing land to convert into inexpensive lots for sale to African Americans. The original name of this community, Free Haven, was due to its crucial role as a stop along several routes of the Underground Railroad. Indeed, the home of Peter Mott, now a nationally recognized refuge of the underground railroad, was saved by the Lawnside Historical Society from demolition in 1992 specifically to preserve this important legacy of the town.

The early village was later known as &quot;Snow Hill&quot; after the Civil War and eventually &quot;Lawnton.&quot; After a train station was constructed by Reading along the Atlantic City Railroad in 1907, the town became known as Lawnside, either from the presence of a spacious lawn at the station or as a shortened description of the stop&#x27;s exit on the &quot;Lawnton side&quot; of the tracks.

In 1919, John Lawson, a prominent Philadelphian and recipient of the Medal of Honor for his service during the Civil War, was laid to rest at Mount Peace Cemetery in Lawnside. The exact reasons behind this location remain uncertain, with possibilities including family connections to Lawnside or the restrictions on burying black veterans in certain Pennsylvania cemeteries at the time.

On March 24, 1926, Governor of New Jersey A. Harry Moore signed into law New Jersey General Assembly Bill 561, dissolving Centre Township, of which Lawnside was a part, and incorporating the Borough of Lawnside, which also included portions of the borough of Barrington. One month later, on April 20, 1926, an &quot;Official Special Election&quot; was held making Lawnside the first independent, self-governing African American community north of the Mason–Dixon line.

Despite historic discrimination from banks against African Americans, the incorporation of the town as a Black community allowed residents to achieve home ownership with minimal bureaucratic obstacles. This was also facilitated by local mortgage lenders like the Home Mutual Investment Company, established in 1909, and the Lawnside Mutual Building and Loan Association in 1915.

Lawnside&#x27;s existence and reputation as a distinctive community was supported in the 1930s through the presence of a thriving jazz and barbecue scene in the wake of prohibition, with venues named the Cotton Club, The Hi-Hat Club, Dreamland Café, and Club Harlem. These establishments attracted visitors from across the northeast, offering the opportunity to enjoy performances by influential African American artists and celebrities who were not allowed to play at white establishments, including such superstars as Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, LaWanda Page, Billy Eckstine, Arthur Prysock, and even champion boxers Joe Louis and Jersey Joe Walcott.

During the 1960s, Lawnside&#x27;s young people, influenced by the Civil rights and Black power movements, led sit-ins, protest marches and media campaigns against the discrimination they faced at the regional Haddon Heights High School, which resulted in changes in school administration, increased representation in student life, the introduction of Black studies courses, and the formation of the Afro-American Cultural Society. On April 9, 1968, Lawnside civic leaders became the first governmental entity in the United States to declare the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. to be a holiday, just days after King&#x27;s assassination.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.43 square miles (3.70 km2), all of which was land.

Lawnside borders the Camden County municipalities of Barrington, Cherry Hill, Haddonfield, Magnolia, Somerdale, Tavistock and Voorhees Township.

The borough&#x27;s first official meeting was held on the following May 31 in the old Fire Hall at Linden Avenue and Berlin Road. The name &quot;Lindenwold&quot; (German for &quot;linden forest&quot;) was suggested by Wimer Bedford, a local resident who had been reading a German book that included the word.

<text>Mount Ephraim(pronounced &quot;EEF-rum&quot;) is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,651, a decrease of 25 (−0.5%) from the 2010 census count of 4,676, which in turn reflected an increase of 181 (+4.0%) from the 4,495 counted in the 2000 census.

The borough had the 20th-highest property tax rate in New Jersey with an equalized rate of 4.442% in 2020, compared to 3.470% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==History==
Mount Ephraim was authorized to incorporate as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1926, from portions of the now-defunct Centre Township, and then incorporated following a referendum on April 28, 1926, being the last borough to dissolve the former township. Acts authorizing the creation of the boroughs of Bellmawr, Runnemede and Lawnside were also passed during the same two-day period. The borough was named for Ephraim Albertson, who owned a tavern in the area in the early 1800s.

In a 1981 decision in &quot;Schad v. Mount Ephraim&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a decision authored for the majority by Associate Justice Byron White, the court decided by a 7–2 margin to overturn the convictions of the two owners of a bookstore where there was nude dancing, despite a prohibition against all forms of live entertainment in the borough&#x27;s zoning ordinance. The decision cited the First Amendment rights of the storeowners.

In January 2014, New Jersey State Senate President Stephen M. Sweeney put forward a proposal which was intended to lower real estate taxes in the state and cut state expenses by merging many of the states 566 municipalities. Mount Ephraim was then the 29th largest town in Camden County, so it is very likely that the town would have been merged with neighboring municipalities to cut costs, share expenses, reduce bureaucracy, share resources, and reduce the burden in the taxpayers and the state itself. Mount Ephraim was formerly part of Centre Township, which included all of the neighboring communities, and it is possible that the name may be used again in the future if the merger proposal goes forward.

<text>Oaklyn is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 3,930, a decrease of 108 (−2.7%) from the 2010 census count of 4,038, which in turn reflected a decline of 150 (−3.6%) from the 4,188 counted in the 2000 census.

The borough had the 28th-highest property tax rate in New Jersey, with an equalized rate of 4.134% in 2020, compared to 3.470% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==History==
Before European settlement began, Oaklyn was dense forest land which was inhabited by Lenape Native Americans. In 1681, a group of Quakers seeking religious freedom sailed from Ireland to Fenwick&#x27;s Colony at Salem, New Jersey, where they spent the winter. In 1682, they sailed up the Delaware River and settled on Newton Creek. William Bates, their leader, purchased on the south side of Newton Creek from the local Native Americans. The original Quaker settlement, known as Newton Colony, was located in The Manor section of today&#x27;s Oaklyn.

The Colony began to grow rapidly and the land was cleared for farming. Eventually two highways were laid out. One, from the Delaware River to Egg Harbor, followed an old Native American trail, which is today the Black Horse Pike. The other was known as the Long-a-coming trail, which extended from Atlantic City to Berlin and then from Berlin to Camden. This trail is now known as the White Horse Pike.

After the American Revolutionary War, a group of Virginia sportsmen built a racetrack on the east side of the White Horse Pike. Future president Ulysses S. Grant visited this track as a young man before it closed in 1846. Samuel Bettle bought the land which was formerly the racetrack and eventually, the land was deeded to Haddon Township.

As the years passed, the farms along Newton Creek were divided into lots and the development called &quot;Oakland the Beautiful&quot;, for the many trees in the area. The name was changed to Oaklyn in 1894 to avoid confusion with another Oakland in North Jersey.

Oaklyn was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 13, 1905, from portions of Haddon Township.

==Government==

===Local government===

Oaklyn is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Oaklyn is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, Oaklyn&#x27;s Mayor is Democrat Greg Brandley, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Oaklyn Borough Council are Council President Nancy MacGregor (D, 2024), Vincenzo &quot;Vince&quot; Angelucci (D, 2025), Chad Jordan (D, 2025), Chuck Lehman (D, 2023), Dorothy A. &quot;Dot&quot; Valianti (D, 2023) and Chris Walters (D, 2024).

In January 2020, the borough council appointed Nancy MacGregor to fill the seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held by Greg Brandley until he resigned to take office as mayor. MacGregor elected in November 2020 to serve the remainder of the term of office.

In April 2018, Sarah McCleery Cairns was sworn in to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that had been held by Robert Skowronek. Cairns served on an interim basis until the November general election, when she was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

====Emergency services====
The Oaklyn Fire Department (Station 18-3) is responsible for fire protection in the Borough of Oaklyn and until December 2007 was responsible for Haddon Township Fire District 3, which paid the Borough of Oaklyn for fire protection through tax money it collected from its residents. Fire District 3 covers the Bettlewood, Heather Glen, and Heather Woods sections of Haddon Township. This was a long-standing agreement that existed since 1905. From 1902 when the Oaklyn fire service was established until 1905, Oaklyn and the Bettlewood section were both in Haddon Township. Subsequently, the Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 of the Oaklyn section of Haddon Township provided fire protection to the whole area, as it was and still is a continuous land mass. When Oaklyn seceded from the township in 1905 there was an agreement made between Oaklyn Borough and Haddon Township that Oaklyn would still protect the District 3 section since they were much closer and the fire apparatus was horse drawn at the time. This relationship continued for another 102 years until January 2008. Currently, Fire District 3 is protected by Westmont Fire Company # 1 pursuant to three consecutive one-year agreements.

The Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 (Station 18-1) was established in 1902 (predating the borough&#x27;s establishment) and was located on Newton Avenue near the Suburban Lumber Company, which ironically has been the site of several famous Camden County fires occurring in the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s. The Oaklyn Fire Company building still stands today as a private residence. The company was formed by Oaklyn residents who had been volunteering their services at the nearby Defender Fire Company (Station 1-2), which was located in the community of Orston (then another section of Haddon Township, now part of Audubon borough). Until the formation of the Oaklyn Fire Company, the Defender Fire Company handled firefighting duties in the Borough of Oaklyn (The Defender Fire Company was subsequently taken over by the Audubon Fire Department (Station 1-1) as of 1996).

The Welcome Fire Company (Station 18-2) was established in 1906 and was located at the corner of the White Horse Pike and West Clinton Avenue. Today, the building houses the Oaklyn Police Department and Borough Hall and stands next to the current fire station. The Welcome Fire Company was established when residents who wished to volunteer with the Oaklyn Fire Company found they had filled their roster and were not &quot;welcoming&quot; any new members, hence their name.

The current incarnation of the Oaklyn Fire Department was established in 1976 when Oaklyn Fire Company No. 1 and the Welcome Fire Company consolidated their services. David Aron was the first chief following the merger, previously serving as chief of the Welcome Fire Company. The current fire chief is Greg Grudzinski.

<doc id="125093" wikidata="Q1089732" url="?curid=125093" title="Pennsauken Township, New Jersey">
<text>Pennsauken Township is a township in Camden County, in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and it is located outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which it borders directly on the Delaware River. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 37,074, an increase of 1,189 (+3.3%) from the 2010 census count of 35,885, which in turn increased by 148 (+0.4%) from the 35,737 counted in the 2000 census.

The township is part of the South Jersey region of the state.

==History==
Pennsauken Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 18, 1892, from portions of the now-defunct Stockton Township.

The exact origin of the name Pennsauken is unclear, but it probably derives from the language of the Lenni Lenape Native Americans, who once occupied the area from &quot;&quot;, the Lenape language term for tobacco pouch. Alternatively, the &quot;Penn&quot; in the township&#x27;s name refers to William Penn, while &quot;sauk&quot; is a water inlet or outlet.

Pennsauken was home to America&#x27;s first drive-in movie theater, created in 1933 with the opening of the Camden Drive-In in Pennsauken. It featured the comedy &quot;Wives Beware&quot;, released in the theaters as &quot;Two White Arms&quot;.

For 50 years, the township was the home to the Pennsauken Mart, a large multi-vendor indoor market, which was closed in January 2006 to make way for a sports arena/conference complex, however, that did not materialize. Most of the vendors relocated to a marketplace in Willingboro Township. A luxury apartment complex was completed on the site in 2018.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 12.13 square miles (31.41 km2), including 10.48 square miles (27.14 km2) of land and 1.65 square miles (4.27 km2) of water (13.59%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Amon Heights, Bethel, Biedemon, Delair, Delair Station, Delaware Gardens, Dudley, East Pennsauken, Fish House, Hillcrest, Homesteadville, Jordantown, Merchantville Park, Morris, Morrisville, North Pennsville and Wellwood.

The township includes Petty&#x27;s Island, a island in the Delaware River although most of the island actually sits across a narrow strait from neighboring Camden. Once an oil storage and distribution facility, the island is now the site of a container cargo shipping operation and nesting bald eagles. Petty&#x27;s Island is currently in the process of being turned over to the State of New Jersey by Citgo to be transformed to a new state park and nature center .

Pennsauken borders Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The two municipalities are connected across the Delaware River by the Betsy Ross Bridge which is owned and operated by the Delaware River Port Authority. In New Jersey, Pennsauken borders Camden, Cherry Hill, Collingswood and Merchantville in Camden County, and Cinnaminson Township, Maple Shade Township and Palmyra in Burlington County.

<text>Pine Valley was a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 21, an increase of 9 (+75.0%) from the 2010 census count of 12, which in turn reflected a decline of 8 (-40.0%) from the 20 counted in the 2000 census. Before its merger with the adjacent Borough of Pine Hill, Pine Valley was the third-smallest municipality by population in New Jersey, with 12 more residents than the nine residing in Tavistock (also in Camden County) and 14 more than the seven in Walpack Township (in Sussex County).

Pine Valley encompassed Pine Valley Golf Club, which regularly ranks highly on &quot;Golf Digest&#x27;s&quot; list of America&#x27;s 100 greatest courses.

The Borough of Pine Valley was created on April 23, 1929, from Clementon Township, one of seven municipalities created from the now-defunct township, and one of five new municipalities (including Hi-Nella Borough, Lindenwold Borough, Pine Hill Borough and Somerdale Borough) created on that same date.

In 2021, the Borough finalized plans to merge with the adjacent Borough of Pine Hill, dissolving the Pine Valley borough government completely when the merger took effect on January 1, 2022.

==Government==

===Local government===
Pine Valley operated under the Walsh Act form of New Jersey municipal government. The borough was one of 30 municipalities (of the then-565) statewide that used the commission form of government. The governing body consisted of three commissioners, who are elected at-large on a non-partisan basis to four-year terms of office in elections held as part of the May municipal elections. Each commissioner was assigned a specific department to head in addition to their legislative functions and one of the three commissioners was chosen to serve as mayor. Pine Valley has been governed under the Walsh Act, by a three-member commission, since 1942.

At the time of the borough&#x27;s dissolution in 2022, the members of the Pine Valley Board of Commissioners were Mayor Michael B. Kennedy, Kendra L. Clark and Debra M. Kennedy all serving terms of office ending May 17, 2022. The three commissioners had run unopposed in the 2018 May municipal election.

The three incumbents—Jane Bromley and husband-and-wife Michael B. Kennedy and Deborah Kennedy—were re-elected in May 2014 to four-year terms of office in an election held entirely by mail to minimize the costs associated with establishing a polling place for the borough&#x27;s 14 voters.

===Federal, state and county representation===
Pine Valley was located in the 1st Congressional District and was part of New Jersey&#x27;s 8th state legislative district. Prior to the 2011 reapportionment following the 2010 census, Pine Valley had been in the 6th state legislative district.

In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Republican Chris Christie received 72.7% of the vote (8 ballots cast), ahead of both Independent Chris Daggett with 18.2% (two votes) and Democrat Jon Corzine with no votes, with eleven ballots cast among the borough&#x27;s fourteen registered voters, yielding a 78.6% turnout.

<text>Runnemede is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,324, a decrease of 144 (−1.7%) from the 2010 census count of 8,468, which in turn reflected a decline of 65 (−0.8%) from the 8,533 counted in the 2000 census.

Runnemede was authorized to incorporate as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1926, from portions of the now-defunct Centre Township, and was then made independent based on the results of a referendum held on April 24, 1926. Acts enabling creation of the boroughs of Bellmawr, Mount Ephraim, and Lawnside were passed during the same two-day period. The derivation of the borough&#x27;s name is uncertain, though claims that it derives from a Native American term for &quot;running water&quot; have been refuted and connections to General George Meade or to &quot;rum we need&quot; for a nearby tavern are probably apocryphal. Sources have cited the name as coming from Runnymede, England.

In the 1880s, the Rural Land Improvement Company began developing the area known as &quot;Old Stratford&quot; and renamed the village after Stratford-upon-Avon, England.

The Borough of Stratford was officially formed on February 13, 1925, from portions of Clementon Township, one of seven municipalities carved from the township.

<text>Tavistock is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 9, an increase of 4 (+80.0%) from the 2010 census count of 5, which in turn reflected a decline of 19 (−79.2%) from the 24 counted in the 2000 census. As of the 2010 Census it was the smallest municipality by population in New Jersey, with seven fewer residents than nearby Pine Valley, which had 12, while the 2020 census placed Tavistock as second-smallest by population, two more than Walpack Township, New Jersey, which had a population of 7.

Tavistock was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 16, 1921, from portions of the now-defunct Centre Township. The name of the borough came from the estate in England of a family of early settlers.

The borough was formed in order to allow the members of Tavistock Country Club to play golf on Sundays by members of the Victor Talking Machine Company. This was prohibited at the Haddon Country Club which was governed by a local blue law prohibiting sporting activities on Sundays. Tavistock&#x27;s secession from Haddonfield, New Jersey, the original site of the club, is said to have been driven by the fact that Haddonfield was (and remains) a dry borough, though Tavistock was formed in 1921 during Prohibition when liquor would have been banned. Members of the club included State Senator Joseph Wallworth and Assembly Speaker T. Harry Rowland, who helped push the bill that created the new municipality to unanimous approval in the New Jersey Legislature.

<text>Waterford Township is a township in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 10,421, a decrease of 228 (−2.1%) from the 2010 census count of 10,649, which in turn reflected an increase of 155 (+1.5%) from the 10,494 counted in the 2000 census.

Waterford Township was originally created by Royal charter on June 1, 1695, while the area was still part of Gloucester County. The township was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. On March 13, 1844, Waterford Township became one of the original townships in the newly created Camden County.

<text>Winslow Township is a township in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 39,907, an increase of 408 (+1.0%) from the 2010 census count of 39,499, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,888 (+14.1%) from the 34,611 counted in the 2000 census.

Winslow Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 8, 1845, from portions of Gloucester Township. Portions of the township were taken on November 26, 1867, to create Chesilhurst. In 1950, the township annexed a portion of Monroe Township in Gloucester County. The township, and all of Camden County, is part of South Jersey and of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD combined statistical area, also known as the Delaware Valley or Philadelphia metropolitan area.

==History==
Winslow Township is Camden County&#x27;s largest municipality at . The township got its name from the son of a 19th-century glass factory owner, William Coffin Sr., who bought large tracts of timber in Camden County about six miles west of Hammonton and with his son-in-law in 1929. Thomas Jefferson Perce and William Coffin Jr., built the Winslow Glass Works (his second one in 12 years) in the midst of a thick pine forest. The community was named for Senior Coffin&#x27;s youngest son, Edward Winslow Coffin.

Winslow Township was incorporated in 1845 from the Township of Gloucester. The township&#x27;s very first meeting was held at Josiah Albertson&#x27;s Blue Anchor Inn which was located on what is now Route 73 in the vicinity of St Lucy&#x27;s Church. During its early years Winslow was known for its thriving glass business which developed as a result of the township&#x27;s abundant resources of timber, clay, and sand, though by the start of the 20th century the glass industry died throughout Winslow. During the early 20th century, Winslow&#x27;s population continued to grow until it peaked at a small 11,000 residents by the 1970s. During this time period the majority of Winslow residents were farmers. In 1965, Winslow township started to see an increase in population as the Atlantic City Expressway was completed with an interchange in Winslow at Williamstown Road. The proximity of the interchange drew developers towards the Sicklerville section of the township, where Levitt &amp; Sons would build thousands of homes throughout the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1980, Winslow&#x27;s population nearly doubled to 20,000 residents.

As of 2006, 80% of the township currently sits in the Pinelands National Reserve, thus restricting future land development. Despite the restriction of development on the reserve, agricultural areas still persist in Winslow.

The township is also served by two area codes, 856 and 609. When area code 609 was split in 1999, the southern/eastern end in the township (primarily those with a Hammonton mailing address, Cedar Brook, and a small section of Sickerville) were left in the 609 code, while the other sections closer to Berlin and Williamstown received 856 as their area code.

<text>Woodlynne is a borough in Camden County, within the U.S. state of New Jersey, and a suburb located southeast of Philadelphia. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 2,902, a decrease of 76 (−2.6%) from the 2,978 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 182 (+6.5%) from the 2,796 counted in the 2000 census. The borough is the state&#x27;s eighth-smallest municipality. Established on the site of a defunct amusement park, the entire borough of Woodlynne is less than one-third the size of Six Flags Great Adventure and Safari.

Woodlynne was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 19, 1901, from portions of Haddon Township. In 1906, the City of Camden made an unsuccessful attempt to annex Woodlynne.

Woodlynne had the highest property tax rate in New Jersey, with an equalized rate of 7.384% in 2020, compared to a statewide average of 2.279% and 3.470% in Camden County. As of the 2010 census, Woodlynne was also home to the highest percentage of Vietnamese residents in New Jersey, at 6.9%.

==History==
First settled by Europeans in 1681, a property owned by Mark Newbie was called Lynnewood, named for the linden trees in the area. The name was changed from Lynnewood to Woodlynne in 1892, due to conflicts with the name of another municipality.
Woodlynne Amusement Park, which encompassed Woodlynne Lake (no longer in existence), operated between the years 1895 and 1914 in the area that now comprises the town of Woodlynne. The New Camden Land Improvement Company commissioned the creation of Woodlynne Amusement Park on the estate of Charles M. Cooper in 1892. Homes built over the old lake tend to flood in the basements during heavy rainstorms.

The Camden and Suburban Railway Company, formed in 1896, established a housing development in a section of Woodlynne Amusement Park, which contributed to its incorporation as Woodlynne Borough in 1901.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.23 square miles (0.58 km2), including 0.22 square miles (0.56 km2) of land and 0.01 square miles (0.02 km2) of water (3.04%).

Woodlynne borders the Borough of Collingswood and the City of Camden.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Woodlynne has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="125107" wikidata="Q1086573" url="?curid=125107" title="Avalon, New Jersey">
<text>Avalon is a borough in Cape May County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located on Seven Mile Island. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,243, a decrease of 91 (−6.8%) from the 2010 census count of 1,334, which in turn declined by 809 (−37.8%) from the 2,143 counted in the 2000 census. The borough&#x27;s population swells to as many as 45,000 during the summer.

Geographically part of the South Jersey region, the community is one of the most affluent communities along the Jersey Shore and is home to some of the most expensive real estate on the East Coast. In 2007, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Avalon as the 65th most expensive ZIP Code in the United States. &quot;Washingtonian&quot; &quot;named Avalon the &#x27;chicest beach&#x27; in the mid-Atlantic, the place to see women in diamonds and designer swimwear.&quot; A small portion of Avalon is not on Seven Mile Island. The borough, and all of Cape May County, is part of the Ocean City metropolitan statistical area, and is part of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD combined statistical area, also known as the Delaware Valley or Philadelphia metropolitan area.

Avalon is known as a South Jersey seashore resort and has the motto &quot;Cooler by a Mile&quot; since it juts out into the Atlantic Ocean about a mile farther than other barrier islands. Alternatively, the motto is because Avalon, at four miles long, is one mile longer than its neighboring town on the southern end of Seven Mile Island, Stone Harbor. It was ranked the seventh-best beach in New Jersey in the 2008 Top 10 Beaches Contest sponsored by the New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium.

==History==
Around 14,000 years ago, the barrier islands of Cape May County formed, likely from spits and lines of dunes. Originally a thriving juniper forest occupied by Lenni Lenape Native Americans, the area was purchased by Aaron Leaming in December 1722 for 79 pounds. Known as Seven Mile Beach (which included present-day Avalon and Stone Harbor), it was owned and retained by the Leamings for approximately 100 years. Unconfirmed legends say that pirates buried their bounty on Seven Mile Island, and that Henry Hudson may have dropped anchor somewhere offshore. The island served as a cattle range and was also used for its plentiful timber. The Leamings eventually sold the land, and the island exchanged hands in a number of transactions afterwards. In April 1887, the Seven Mile Beach company was formed. As early as 1893, Avalon was advertised as a resort town. With this rapid development, homes and businesses were erected. The native juniper forest was graded and cut, and the sandy hills were leveled off, making the island mostly flat. Today it is extremely rare to see hills or native juniper in Avalon.

Avalon was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 18, 1892, from portions of Middle Township, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier. The borough was reincorporated on March 6, 1896, and again on May 4, 1897. Another portion of Middle Township was annexed in 1910. On December 27, 1941, portions of Avalon were ceded to Stone Harbor. The borough is named for Avalon of Arthurian legend.

On January 4, 1890, the &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, piloted by Captain W.S. Willets, sank. This 197-ton ship was en route from New York City to Philadelphia with a cargo of molasses, coffee, tobacco, tea, coconut oil, and camphor. Straying from its course in rough weather, the &quot;Commonwealth&quot; ran aground in Townsend&#x27;s Inlet. The crew was rescued and most of the cargo was salvaged. However, after a week trapped in the sandy bottom of the inlet, the ship began to come apart in the waves. Some of the remaining cargo washed ashore and most of it was taken by the early residents of Avalon. The wreck, unable to be recovered, was sold to John Townshend on February 2.
By the early 1900s, the Leaming Railroad bridge was constructed, allowing train connections into the town. This increased the traffic from nearby Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Around 1944 the West Jersey and Seashore railroad lines merged with the Reading Railroad. This effectively ended the era of travel by train to the island. A hurricane took several streets and Avalon now has a north end beginning at 7th street. In the mid-1950s the Wolfington Family of Philadelphia purchased and operated the Puritan Hotel later enlarged and renamed the Whitebriar Hotel on the beach block at 21st Street. The Whitebriar was managed for two seasons in the mid-1950s, one of the future &#x27;great hosts&#x27; of several hotels in the Greater Philadelphia area, Robert C. Bennett. He was the son of another &#x27;famous&#x27; hotelier, Claude H. Bennett of the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. Currently the most widely used method of transportation to and from Avalon is by car or boat; however, buses run on a regular schedule all over the shore towns.

==Transportation==

===Roads and highways===

, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality and by Cape May County.

No Interstate, U.S., state or major county highways serve Avalon. The most significant roads are minor county routes, such as County Route 601 (Avalon Boulevard), which connects the Garden State Parkway and U.S. Route 9 to the oceanfront, and County Route 619, which follows Ocean Drive.

===Public transportation===
There is also a seasonal trolley service that runs through the seven-mile-long island. Avalon also has multiple NJ Transit bus stops, and is served by the 315 to and from Philadelphia and the 319 that provides service to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Avalon has a Humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). 


===The Nor&#x27;easter of 1962===
In March 1962, a major Nor&#x27;easter, the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, tore through the U.S. East Coast causing massive ocean swells. Much of Avalon suffered very serious flooding and major coastline loss. Much of the island was under water for four to five days, with damage to homes dependent on the foundation construction of the home and location on the island.

===Protection efforts against storms===
While there have been many strong storms since 1962, extensive rock jetty construction on Townsends Inlet (as recent as Summer 2006) has mostly succeeded in protecting the inlet-side homes. However, beaches and property facing the ocean at 8th through 12th Streets have struggled to prevent further loss of this barrier island through various anti-erosion schemes, including extending the 8th Street rock jetty, the installation of an artificial reef and the beach replenishment. So far, there has been no more &quot;shrinkage&quot; of the island at this location, but at a very high monetary cost. Several times, in 2015, the causeway leading north from Avalon to Townsends Inlet has been closed by flooding during stormy weather.

==Ecology==
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Avalon would have a dominant vegetation type of Northern Cordgrass (&quot;73&quot;) with a dominant vegetation form of Coastal Prairie (&quot;20&quot;).
