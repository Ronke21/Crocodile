<text>Long Lake is a small city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States named after the lake the eastern end of town lies on. A commercial hub for the surrounding communities, Long Lake is home to many local shops and businesses. U.S. Highway 12 runs through the town. The population was 1,768 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

The first settlers arrived in Long Lake in early spring, 1855. This early contact in Long Lake did not result in settlement but rather this group of Nova Scotians came down Watertown Road, walked to the lake, looked across the lake and settled on the north side of the lake in what is now Orono. The first permanent settlement was established in May 1855 with the arrival of the Flemings and the George Knettles from Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. This first settlement was named Cumberland Town and consisted of a saw mill, general store and schoolhouse. The platted area Cumberland Addition can trace its roots to this early period. The Knettle&#x27;s house became a favorite stop for travelers between 1855 and 1860 and is the location of the first public religious service in the community. The first post office was established in 1856, which was named Tamarack in recognition of the Tamarack swamps in the western part of the country.

A significant aspect of the early settlement of Long Lake was the relationship between the Dakota, the Chippewa and the settlers. The origin of the Union Cemetery is found in this tripartite relationship. The area where the cemetery is located was called Teepee Hill in these early years. It served as an encampment for the Chippewa in 1859–1860. The Dakota were informed of the location of the Chippewa through two settlers in the area. This information prompted many of the Dakota to be in and around Long Lake. Although there was no fighting and the actual intentions of the Dakota are not clear, their presence in the area forced the Chippewa to vacate Teepee Hill. This area was acquired by Bradford Wakefield, most probably through adverse possession, and purchased by Union Cemetery Association in 1861. There was concern among the settlers that the Chippewa would return, so by establishing a cemetery (hallowed ground) it was unlikely that any Native American people would choose that site as an encampment, thus assuring the safety of the surrounding area.

During the middle to late 19th century, Long Lake developed like many other towns. A sawmill was erected (1866), the railroad reached Long Lake (1868), a school district was organized (1869), a general store was started (1870), the Freethinkers Hall was organized (1874), a flour mill was established (1875), and a hotel was added (1875). These institutions were all-important elements to early town development in the Upper Midwest.

The late 1890s – early 1900s became known as the berry years in Long Lake. The Minnesota Fruit Growers Association was established in Long Lake in 1898 to focus on promoting strawberry and raspberry production. These products became a regional specialty with shipments going as far as Fargo and Grand Forks, North Dakota.

The catalyst for the expansion of the city limits was a desire by Long Lake&#x27;s neighbors to take advantage of the city&#x27;s decision to install a sewer system. Those areas that wanted to be connected to city sewer were annexed by the city.

West Wayzata Boulevard (Old Highway 12), now Hennepin County Road 112, and U.S. Highway 12 both serve as the main routes in the community.

<text>Minnetonka ( ) is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. A western suburb of the Twin Cities, Minnetonka is located about west of Minneapolis. At the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 53,781. 

Minnetonka is the home of Cargill, the country&#x27;s largest privately owned company, and UnitedHealth Group, the state&#x27;s largest publicly owned company. I-494 runs through the city while I-394/US 12 and US 169 are situated along the suburb&#x27;s northern and eastern boundaries respectively.

==History==
Since the mid-19th century, Minnetonka has evolved from heavily wooded wilderness through extensive farming and industrialization to its present primarily residential suburban character. The Minnetonka area was home to the Dakota and Ojibwe Native American tribes before Euro-Americans arrived in the 1800s. They believed Lake Minnetonka (&quot;mni&quot; meaning water, and &quot;tanka&quot; meaning big, anglicized to Minnetonka) and the land around it to be sacred. The first recorded exploration of the area by Euro-Americans was in 1822, when a group from newly constructed Fort Snelling made its way up Minnehaha Creek (then known as Brown&#x27;s Creek or Falls Creek) to the lake. In 1851, the Dakota sold the area including Minnetonka to the United States with the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux. The first census, the Territorial Census of 1857, lists 41 households. Twenty-nine of the heads of households are listed as farmers. The occupations of the remaining twelve are associated with the operations of Minnetonka Mill and a nearby hotel.

In 1852, a claim was staked on Minnehaha Creek near McGinty Road. The sawmill that was constructed in the thick woods of maple, oak, elm, red cedar and basswood was the first privately operated mill in Minnesota west of the Mississippi River. Oak timbers from this mill were used to build the first suspension bridge across the Mississippi River at Saint Anthony Falls in 1853. The settlement of Minnetonka Mills that grew up around the mill was the first permanent European–American settlement west of Minneapolis in Hennepin County. In 1855, a two-story sawmill was constructed with a furniture factory on the second floor. A building for varnishing furniture was built on the south side of the creek, at the present Bridge Street. Production consisted mainly of chairs and bedsteads.


In 1860, after only 8 years of operation, the sawmill closed. In 1869, a flour and grist mill were constructed and operated until the late 1880s. In 1874, Charles H. Burwell came to manage the Minnetonka Mill Company, and he built a Victorian home on the north bank of Minnehaha Creek (Minnetonka Boulevard at McGinty Road East) for his family. The Charles H. Burwell House is now on the National Register of Historic Places and is owned by the city. There were two other mills in Minnetonka: the St. Alban&#x27;s Mill, which was less than downstream from Minnetonka Mills on Minnehaha Creek, operated as a flour mill from 1874 to 1881. A grist mill built on Purgatory Creek was washed out in a flood shortly after construction. Minnetonka Mills, with its post office and port for Lake Minnetonka, was the principal business and trading center for a large area until the 1870s.

Between 1883 and 1956, the area within the original township grew smaller as Wayzata, Hopkins, Deephaven, Woodland and Saint Louis Park incorporated or annexed portions of then-Minnetonka Township.

Until as late as the 1960s, many portions of Minnetonka were still rural in character, with horse pasture and farms. Those final areas have since been developed with the city now a fully developed suburban community.

The Minnetonka Town Hall, built in 1906, is on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Mound is a city in western Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 9,052 at the 2010 census. Mound was the birthplace of the Tonka truck that is named after Lake Minnetonka, which the eastern part of town sits on. Mound is west of Minneapolis, the county seat.

==History==

According to Melvin Gimmestad&#x27;s &quot;Historical Backgrounds of Mound, Minnesota&quot;, &quot;Mound derived its name from the Indian mounds once found within the present day city limits. They were not built by the Dakota Indians, but were made by prehistoric Indians&quot;.

The former municipality of Island Park, which contained Phelps Island, merged with Mound in 1960.

Mound celebrated its centennial in 2012.

==Geography==

Mound has more than 1,000 docks on its various lakes. The lakes geographically define the town&#x27;s areas, such as Three Points, The Island, The Highlands, Grandview Boulevard and Shirley Hills.

Lake Langdon is immediately west of Mound, between an old Great Northern railroad line and Lake Minnetonka. One of its most notable places is an old ice house and grocery store at the east side of the lake. For many years in the 1940s and &#x27;50s, the store was owned and operated by Ed and Pete Sollie, uncles of the Andrews Sisters singing group. Other historic places on Lake Langdon&#x27;s east shore are Our Lady of the Lake parochial school and the Mound Baptist Church, long cared for by Ulrich Eugster, an immigrant to the U.S. from Reute, Switzerland.

<text>Orono ( , ) is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. It is situated west of Minneapolis on the north shore of Lake Minnetonka. Orono is an affluent municipality that ranks as one of the wealthiest cities in the state.

The population was 7,437 at the 2010 census. Orono is in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area.

==History==
Orono was originally part of Excelsior Township. In 1868, it became part of Medina Township. Residents received permission from Hennepin County to form the independent town of Orono in 1889. It was incorporated as a city in 1955.

Orono is named after Orono, Maine, the hometown of early resident George A. Brackett.

Fire Service

On November 21, 2023, a Hennepin County Court found Orono in contempt for violating an injunctive relief order designed to safeguard the Long Lake Fire Department, its longstanding fire service provider. The court issued the order after Orono hired the Long Lake Fire Chief, attempted to take control over Long Lake Station 2, purchased a ladder truck Long Lake was considering, and asked the state legislator to forcibly transfer Long Lake&#x27;s pensions to Orono to build its own fire department, while Long Lake remains contracted to serve Orono, Minnetonka Beach, and Medina. The contempt order was likely the first ever issued to a municipality in Minnesota and resulted from the city willfully disobeying the provisions of the injunction prohibiting the recruitment of Long Lake firefighters and the use of Long Lake Station 2. The court also found Mayor Dennis Walsh and Fire Chief James Van Eyll colluded to intimidate a Long Lake firefighter in violation of the order and fined the city for its violations.

<doc id="120218" wikidata="Q2229441" url="?curid=120218" title="Osseo, Minnesota">
<text>Osseo ( ) is a small city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. As of the 2020 United States Census, it has a population of 2,688.

==Etymology==
It is said that &quot;Osseo&quot; derives from the Ojibwe name &quot;Waaseyaa&quot; meaning &quot;There is light&quot;, more commonly translated as &quot;Son of the Evening Star&quot;. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow uses the word &quot;Osseo&quot; in his poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;.

==Geography==
Osseo is in northeastern Hennepin County, bordered by Brooklyn Park to the east and Maple Grove to the west. It has an area of , all land.

There are three main transportation routes in the city. Jefferson Highway runs straight north/south through the city; the business stretch is Central Avenue. U.S. Highway 169 follows the eastern boundary. Bottineau Boulevard (County Road 81) runs northwest through the city.

==History==

The area that is now Osseo was settled before organized local government. It was on what Pierre Bottineau named Bottineau Prairie in 1852; the community was called Palestine. In 1856 part of the town was platted as Osseo and another part as &quot;City of Attraction&quot;. Official Minnesota Territory surveys placed the settlement on the border of two townships. When Brooklyn Township and Maple Grove Township organized, Osseo (and City of Attraction, which later merged) was governed by those two governments. Osseo incorporated on March 17, 1875.

The ethnic groups that moved in after Native tribes were removed were mostly French Canadians, New Englanders, Swiss and Germans. The pioneers&#x27; businesses included blacksmiths, wagonmakers, general merchandise stores, boots &amp; shoemakers, harness makers, tin shops, cordwood suppliers, teamsters, saloons, and hotels (Niggler Hotel, 1867; International Hotel, 1874; Great Northern Hotel, 1907). There was also a Catholic church (1858), a physician, school, post office, and calaboose (jail). Methodists and Lutherans were served in their homes until the 20th century.

In 1882 the Great Northern Railroad &quot;came steaming through town&quot;, and in 1893 a telephone station appeared. A town hall was built in 1901. The city water system and fire department began in 1915. The original Indian trail—extending from St. Paul to St. Cloud—was the town&#x27;s main street, and was paved in 1918 (Territorial Road). Osseo Lutheran Church was built around 1915; the Methodist Church was built in 1922. The first Osseo High School was built in 1924. 1928 was the peak when &quot;Osseo had one of the largest potato markets in the Northwest.&quot;

A newspaper article written upon the death of John Hechtman, &quot;The Father of Osseo&quot;, informs the reader of Osseo&#x27;s opportunities and social organizations of his time.

Opposite today&#x27;s City Hall are memorials to US military veterans from Osseo. In 1937 a large granite monument was erected in memory of Civil War soldiers. On Memorial Day 1946 another Honor Roll was constructed of granite with a bronze plate engraved with names of those who served during the Spanish–American War, World War I and World War II. In 1957 the memorial area was named Father Boerboom Park, after a pastor of St. Vincent Rectory and the principal of its parochial school who had served since 1917.

The Osseo Water Tower, built in 1915, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

== Government ==
Osseo incorporated in 1875 as a village and became a statutory city in 1972. The city council comprises a mayor (two-year term) and four councilors (four-year terms). City departments are Economic Development, Planning, Administration, Community Development, Fire, Parks/Recreation, Police, and Public Works. The Osseo Library is in City Hall and is a branch of the Hennepin County Library System. Osseo publishes a quarterly newsletter, &quot;Osseo Outlook&quot;, and co-publishes an annual resident guide with Maple Grove; both are online. City facilities include a community center. The city is a member of the North Hennepin Area Chamber of Commerce.

==Education==
Schools within the city limits are Osseo Middle School and Osseo Senior High School. Osseo and surrounding communities are served free public education from primary level to secondary level by the Osseo Area School District 279. The school district also provides free public education for Brooklyn Center, Brooklyn Park, Maple Grove, Plymouth, Corcoran, Dayton and Hassan. The district&#x27;s mission is &quot;to inspire and prepare all students with the confidence, courage and competence to achieve their dreams; contribute to community; and engage in a lifetime of learning.&quot;

==Demographics==

2020 census

As of the census of 2020, there were 2,688 people in 1,273 households residing in the city. The racial majority of the city is White, with 241 residents recorded as biracial. 15.4% of the residents are under 18. 27.2% are 65 or older. 29.2% are of German ancestry. 7.2% have graduate or professional degrees. The poverty rate is 3.9%.

==Annual events==
Osseo has multiple social clubs and ongoing activities:

Osseo Orchard

In 2017, volunteers planted over 30 trees and fruiting shrubs at the Osseo Public Works site at the intersection of 2nd Street SE and 8th Ave SE. The orchard includes apples, pears, plums, and cherries. Berries include blueberries, currants, and jostaberries. Residents are welcome to visit the orchard and take advantage of ripe produce.

Concerts and Movies in the Park

An effort led by Osseo&#x27;s citizens enabled the construction of a bandshell in the northeast corner of Boerboom Veterans Park downtown. The bandshell is a popular place in the summer when musicians perform on Tuesday evenings, followed at dusk by a movie. This activity is supported by local donations and almost all events are free to the public.

Osseo Marching Band Festival

The Osseo Marching Band Festival is a street marching competition between high school bands along a route through the city. Popular in northern midwestern states including Minnesota and Wisconsin, street marching band competitions are held in May, June and July. The Osseo Marching Band Festival is held each year on Saturday of the last full weekend in June. A free award ceremony is held afterward in the High School Stadium. This activity is organized by the Osseo Band Boosters and funded by local donations, corporate sponsorship and fund-raising activities.

Lions Roar

The Osseo Lions Roar, hosted by the Osseo Lions Club, is held on the Friday and Saturday after Labor Day. It includes a street fair with crafts, a carnival in the parking lots near Central Avenue and 3rd Street, and a parade at noon on Saturday beginning at Sipe&#x27;s Park and ending at the Osseo Senior High School. The parade features local organizations such as sports teams from the high school, girl scout and boy scout troops, and the Osseo Marching Band.

Osseo Lions Kiddie Costume Parade

Osseo Lions Kiddie Costume Parade is held on Saturday at the end of October at noon. The parade starts at North Clinic on Central Avenue and ends at Boerboom Park.

Minnidazzle

Each December, usually the first Friday in December, the community celebrates the upcoming holidays with the Fire Truck Parade, hot beverages and bonfire, and a chance for children to meet Santa and get a free goodie bag. This activity is sponsored by the Osseo Business Association. It is free and open to the public.

<text>Plymouth is a city in Hennepin County in the U.S. state of Minnesota. A suburb in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, the city is about west of downtown Minneapolis. The population was 81,026 at the 2020 census, making it Minnesota&#x27;s 7th-largest city.

==History==
Plymouth&#x27;s history can be traced to the pre-Columbian period. The original inhabitants were the Dakota. Their encampment was at the north end of Medicine Lake. The name Medicine Lake is derived from the Dakota word Mdewakanton, meaning &quot;Lake of the Spirit.&quot; The Dakota named the lake after a warrior who overturned his canoe and his body was never recovered.

Antoine LeCounte, a guide and explorer, was the first settler in this area. He arrived in 1848, but did not settle until 1852. He carried mail from the Red River of the North to points south, trading goods to Native Americans for horses on the way. LeCounte built the first cabin at what is now East Medicine Lake Boulevard at 29th Avenue North.

Plymouth&#x27;s beginning as a town occurred in 1855 on the northwest shores of what is now known as Parkers Lake. A gristmill and other structures were built in the area. In the spring of 1857, when Parkers Lake flooded, the mill was taken down and moved to Wayzata.

As new settlers arrived in the area, they organized. The Hennepin County Board of Commissioners named the new settlement Plymouth. On April 19, 1858, a group of townspeople met at Francis Day&#x27;s home to open elections for town offices. On May 11, 1858, the group voted to change the town&#x27;s name to Medicine Lake. This was used once at the town meeting, but for reasons not recorded, it was never used again.

During the Dakota War of 1862 between white settlers and the Dakota at Fort Ridgely, near New Ulm, the settlers of Plymouth formed a militia. When the Civil War started, Plymouth paid its volunteers $25 to enlist. About this time, schools and churches were built and a post office was in Plymouth. By 1863, hotels were being built, with Medicine Lake becoming a local tourist destination.

By 1880, Plymouth had a population of 1,074. Farming was the city&#x27;s dominant profession and remained so until the mid-1900s. Roads were built across Plymouth, providing access to other towns.

As the community&#x27;s character evolved from rural to suburban, so did local government. Plymouth incorporated as a village on May 18, 1955. The city adopted the Council–Manager form of government on August 1, 1968. Plymouth became a statutory city on February 7, 1974. It remained a statutory city until voters made it a home rule charter city by adopting a City Charter on November 3, 1992.

<text>Richfield is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota. An inner-ring suburb of Minneapolis, Richfield is bordered by Minneapolis to the north, Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport and Fort Snelling to the east, Bloomington to the south, and Edina to the west. The population was 36,994 at the 2020 census.

Best Buy, the U.S.&#x27;s largest electronics retailer, is headquartered in Richfield.

==History==
In the 1820s, some small settlements developed around Fort Snelling. By the late 1830s, the fortress served as a destination for newcomers—lumbermen, missionaries, farmers, traders and travelers—migrating to the borderlands people were now calling &quot;Minisota&quot;. Minnesotan Franklin Steele reached the area in 1837 and worked as a sutler, selling goods to soldiers.

Fort Snelling&#x27;s garrison made up the bulk of the area&#x27;s population, along with Henry Sibley and Alexander Faribault&#x27;s 75-person American Fur Company operation. Other small settlements of traders, farmers, missionaries and refugees began to develop outside the fort, some with permission, some without. These residents built communities on land that became known as Richfield.

;Minnesota&#x27;s oldest suburb claim
Richfield was one of the earliest postwar suburbs in the Twin Cities to be populated by veterans returning from World War II, but its claim to be Minnesota&#x27;s oldest suburb date to the land&#x27;s connection to Fort Snelling in the 1820s. The term &quot;suburb&quot; is from the Latin &quot;suburbium&quot;, &quot;the land outside a walled city&quot;. Much of the land that comprised the Township of Richfield and today&#x27;s City of Richfield included the Fort Snelling military reservation, which included Camp Coldwater.

===Richfield Township is established===
One of the first settlers to the area was Riley Bartholomew, a former general in the Ohio Militia. He later became a Richfield justice of the peace and a Minnesota state senator. Bartholomew built a house on Wood Lake&#x27;s eastern shore in 1852, and the restored Riley Lucas Bartholomew House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, the Richfield Historical Society maintains the house and the site.

The Harmony post office, south of the Richland Mill on Lyndale Avenue, opened in 1854. Postmaster James Dunsmoor named the mail center after his hometown in Maine. Richfield farmers looked on the metropolis to its north as their marketing target. They helped supply its restaurants, hotels, grocers and citizens with fresh produce, with enough left over to ship by railroad to other cities.

On May 11, 1858, Congress approved the Territory of Minnesota as the 32nd state to join the union. That day, local citizens met in a schoolhouse at present-day 53rd and Lyndale to form a municipal government. At that meeting, those who previously said they lived in Harmony or Richland Mills chose the name Richfield for their community.

Settlers from Maine made up 35% of U.S.-born adults 18 or older in 1860 Richfield. New York immigrants were 21%. Immigrants from Ireland, numbering 58, represented half of the 119 adults from other nations. Just three of Richfield&#x27;s citizens had been born in Minnesota.

Richfield&#x27;s fields proved bountiful for the settlers. Early crops included corn, wheat and oats. Wheat immediately became the cash crop, sold in the area&#x27;s first major market, St. Paul. Those in southern Hennepin County found it more profitable to haul their wheat crop to St. Paul than to the St. Anthony Falls district. This was before &quot;King Wheat&quot; and Minneapolis&#x27;s evolution into a milling center.

;Market gardening
Minneapolis became a favorite trading point for market gardeners in 1897 with the building of the modern, covered Second Street Market just two blocks west of Hennepin Avenue and Bridge Square. The market featured a massive platform for gardeners, including Richfield&#x27;s sizable contingent, to unload and display produce. The new system freed streets from traffic snarls by allowing each person to unhitch and put up their horses, while their wagon was backed into an assigned space. Wholesale customers could then bring their teams to the platform and negotiate prices when the starting bell sounded.

===Boundary changes===
Today&#x27;s boundaries differ markedly from those the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners set forth on April 10, 1858, when it established the towns of Richfield, Minneapolis, Bloomington and Eden Prairie. Richfield&#x27;s boundaries included about 63 square miles. Richfield originally ranged to Minneapolis&#x27;s Lake Street on the north, to what is now Highway 169 on the west, to Bloomington on the south, and to Fort Snelling and the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers on the east.

Parts of Richfield were later lost to neighboring towns or villages through annexation. An 1886 partition of Richfield created the village of St. Louis Park, and a division in 1889 produced the village of Edina. Minneapolis absorbed sizeable portions of Richfield through legislative action or annexations in 1867, 1883, 1887 and 1927. The growth of Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport during the last half of the 20th century and additions of land to the Fort Snelling compound meant further reductions.

===20th century===
In 1908, Richfield became a village. From 1908 until 1950, Richfield&#x27;s local government consisted of a president, three trustees, and a city clerk. On November 7, 1950, residents voted for a city-manager form of government, meaning the city had a mayor, four council members, and a city manager. This is still Richfield&#x27;s form of government. The first mayor was Clarence Christian, who began serving in 1951, but served as president under the old format dating back to 1948. By the late 1940s, the city&#x27;s population started increasing rapidly as farmland was sold to developers building homes for veterans returning from World War II. The Richfield Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1955 and has been deeply involved in the community&#x27;s development and redevelopment.

Over the years, populations of all nearby communities increased and after World War II, Richfield flourished with commuters to Twin Cities jobs. As of 2019, Richfield has a population of about 35,000, who live within seven square miles of neighborhoods, parks, and shops.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Interstates 35W and 494 and Minnesota State Highways 62 and 77 are four of the main routes in the city. Other main routes include 66th Street.

The majority of the 10,000 single-family homes were constructed in the 1950s, and the 5,000 apartments date from the 1960s and early 1970s. The Richfield Rediscovered Housing Program has established an environment of change in the community as it encourages home remodeling, expansion, and reconstruction. The program is gradually changing the face of Richfield&#x27;s residential neighborhoods, upgrading them from small, post-WWII styles to larger homes.

==Economy==

===Business===
Best Buy Company, Inc. moved its corporate headquarters to Richfield in 2003, becoming its largest employer. Public subsidies of almost $60 million were spent to attract the corporate campus including spending $48 million to purchase and demolish over 100 homes and 3 car dealerships within the city just north of I-494. Tax increment financing was used to fund other infrastructure. The use of eminent domain for a private business was controversial and resulted in lawsuits.

From the first quarter of 2001 to the first quarter of 2003, net job growth equaled 2,444 – the second highest in the metropolitan area. Additionally, total employment in Richfield jumped from 10,090 to nearly 15,000 between 1995 and 2005.

In 2007, Cedar Point Commons opened in Richfield at Cedar Avenue and 66th Street, adjacent to Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. Target and The Home Depot serve as its anchor tenants.

===Top employers===
According to the city&#x27;s 2023 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

==Education==

Four elementary schools serve primary students in grades K-5: Centennial Elementary; Sheridan Elementary; R-STEM Elementary, which focuses its curriculum on science, technology, engineering, and math; and RDLS Elementary, a dual language school that teaches students in both English and Spanish.

Students in grades 6-8 attend Richfield Middle School. Richfield High School serves approximately 1400 students in grades 9–12.

The South Education Center is in the 7400 block of South Penn Avenue. It serves pre-K through &quot;Transition&quot; age.

In addition to Richfield Public Schools, public charter schools also serve residents, including Seven Hills Preparatory Academy and Watershed High School.

==Recreation==
Richfield has more than of parkland, 23 neighborhood parks, and a nature preserve. Wood Lake Nature Center is a park operated by the city that features wetlands, walking paths and an interpretive center. When the Nature Center opened in 1971, it was one of the nation&#x27;s first urban nature centers. It is home to more than 200 different kinds of birds and 30 mammals.

Richfield&#x27;s Ice Arena has two full-size indoor skating rinks. Hockey games, figure skating, broom ball games, open skating, and community events all take place there. Near the ice arena is Richfield&#x27;s outdoor pool. Renovated in 2003, it features a 50-meter competitive pool, wading pool, and a double waterslide.

2017-2019 brought a major overhaul of 66th street to improve the look of the city and increase recreation opportunities, with new, dedicated bike and walking lanes for pedestrians.

<text>King George&#x27;s War (1744–1748) is the name given to the military operations in North America that formed part of the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). It was the third of the four French and Indian Wars. It took place primarily in the British provinces of New York, Massachusetts Bay (which included Maine as well as Massachusetts at the time), New Hampshire (which included Vermont at the time), and Nova Scotia. Its most significant action was an expedition organized by Massachusetts Governor William Shirley that besieged and ultimately captured the French fortress of Louisbourg, on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, in 1745. In French, it is known as the &quot;Troisième Guerre Intercoloniale&quot; or Third Intercolonial War.

The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the war in 1748 and restored Louisbourg to France, but failed to resolve any outstanding territorial issues.

==Causes==

The War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear (named for a 1731 incident in which a Spanish commander sliced off the ear of British merchant captain Robert Jenkins and told him to take it to his king, George II) broke out in 1739 between Spain and Great Britain, but was restrained to the Caribbean Sea and conflict between Spanish Florida and the neighboring British Province of Georgia. The War of the Austrian Succession, nominally a struggle over the legitimacy of the accession of Maria Theresa to the Austrian throne, began in 1740, but at first did not involve either Britain or Spain militarily. Britain was drawn diplomatically into that conflict in 1742 as an ally of Austria and an opponent of France and Prussia, but open hostilities between them did not take place until 1743 at Dettingen.

War was not formally declared between Britain and France until March 1744. Massachusetts did not declare war against Canada and France until June 2.

==Course of the war==

News of war declarations reached the French fortress at Louisbourg first, on May 3, 1744, and the forces there wasted little time in beginning hostilities. Concerned about their overland supply lines to Quebec, they raided the British fishing port of Canso on May 23, and then organized an attack on Annapolis Royal, the capital of Nova Scotia. But French forces were delayed in departing Louisbourg, and their Mi&#x27;kmaq and Maliseet First Nations allies, together with Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre, decided to attack on their own at Fort Anne in early July.

Annapolis had received news of the war declaration, and the British forces were somewhat prepared when the First Nations warriors began besieging Fort Anne. Lacking heavy weapons, the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Maliseet withdrew after a few days. Then, in mid-August, a larger French force arrived at Fort Anne, but it was also unable to mount an effective attack or siege against the garrison. The fort had received supplies and reinforcements from Massachusetts.

In 1745, British colonial forces captured Fortress Louisbourg after a siege of six weeks. In retaliation, the Wabanaki Confederacy of Acadia launched the Northeast Coast Campaign (1745) against the British settlements on the border of Acadia in northeast Maine. France launched a major expedition to recover Louisbourg in 1746. Beset by storms, disease, and finally the death of its commander, the Duc d&#x27;Anville, the expedition&#x27;s survivors returned to France in tatters without reaching its objective.
The war was also fought on the frontiers between the northern British colonies and New France. Each side had allies among the Native Americans, and outlying villages were raided and captives taken for ransom, or sometimes adoption by Native American tribes who had suffered losses to disease or warfare. As a result of the frequent raiding on the northern frontier, Governor William Shirley ordered the construction of a chain of frontier outposts stretching west to its border with New York.

On November 28, 1745, the French with their Indian allies raided and destroyed the village of Saratoga, New York, killing or capturing more than one hundred of its inhabitants. After this, the British abandoned their settlements in New York north of Albany, a major trading city. In July 1746 an Iroquois and intercolonial force assembled in northern New York for a retaliatory attack against British forces.

When the expected British regulars never arrived, the attack was called off. A large (1,000+ man) French and First Nations force mustered to raid in the upper Hudson River valley in 1746 instead raided in the Hoosac River valley, including an attack on Fort Massachusetts (at present-day North Adams, Massachusetts). This was in retaliation for the slaying of an Indian leader in an earlier skirmish. Other raids included the 1747 French and Mi&#x27;kmaq raid on Grand Pré, Nova Scotia; and a raid in 1748 by Indian allies of the French against Schenectady, New York.

==Aftermath==

The war took a heavy toll, especially in the northern British colonies. The losses of Massachusetts men alone in 1745–46 have been estimated as 8% of that colony&#x27;s adult male population.

According to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Louisbourg was returned to France three years later, in exchange for the city of Madras in India, which had been captured by the French from the British. This decision outraged New Englanders, particularly Massachusetts colonists who had contributed the most to the expedition (in terms of funding and personnel). The British government eventually acknowledged Massachusetts&#x27; effort with a payment of £180,000 after the war. The province used this money to retire its devalued paper currency.

The peace treaty, which restored all colonial borders to their pre-war status, did little to end the lingering enmity between France, Britain, and their respective colonies, nor did it resolve any territorial disputes. Tensions remained in both North America and Europe. They broke out again in 1754, with the start of the French and Indian War in North America, which spread to Europe two years later as the Seven Years&#x27; War. Between 1749 and 1755 in Acadia and Nova Scotia, the fighting continued in Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War.

<text>Wayzata ( ) is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 4,434 at the 2020 census. The city is about west of Minneapolis and is situated on the northern shore of Lake Minnetonka, the ninth largest lake in the state.

Nicknamed &quot;The Gateway to Lake Minnetonka,&quot; Wayzata is known for both its shopping and restaurant scene along with its access to outdoor recreation. The greater Wayzata area has been ranked as one of the wealthiest zip codes in the state.

==History==
===Early history===
The name &quot;Wayzata&quot; comes from the Dakota word &quot;wazíyata&quot;, meaning “north” or “north shore.” The Mdewakanton, a subtribe of the Dakota nation, treasured Lake Minnetonka—the &quot;Big Water&quot;—as a place for hunting, fishing, and harvesting wild rice and maple sap. Spirit Knob, a peninsula in Wayzata Bay, was regarded as a particularly sacred place. The Dakota resided in this area of Minnesota until 1851, when the Treaty of Mendota was signed and land west of the Mississippi was opened for Euro-American settlement. Most Dakota were exiled from Minnesota after 1862.

Oscar E. Garrison originally platted Wayzata in 1854. In 1855, it saw an influx of settlers, who built a sawmill, a hotel, and a blacksmith shop. Most early settlers made their living by clear-cutting the land to grow corn and wheat. In 1857, this flourishing economy was nearly terminated by a grasshopper infestation, but the community rebounded when ginseng was discovered in the remaining hardwood forest. Ginseng root was in great demand as an aphrodisiac in China. During this boom, Wayzata became a collection center for ginseng roots discovered around Lake Minnetonka.

In 1867 the Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad extended its tracks to Wayzata, making it the area&#x27;s transportation hub. The railroad was particularly important to local farmers because they now had easy access to markets in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and beyond. The railroad also made Wayzata the original &quot;gateway&quot; to Lake Minnetonka, which was billed as a place of commanding beauty and good health.

===Resort period===

In the 1860s and 1870s many small hotels and boarding houses were erected around Wayzata and Lake Minnetonka to accommodate tourists. One early example was the Maurer House-West Hotel, which was built near the corner of Lake Street and Broadway Avenue. Most local hotels and boarding houses were rather primitive until 1879, when the 150-room Hotel Saint Louis was built in Deephaven.

Most Lake Minnetonka tourists in the late 1800s arrived in Wayzata by train. Steamboats waited for new arrivals near the foot of Broadway Avenue and took them to destinations across the lake. Some of these steamboats, such as the &quot;City of Saint Louis&quot; and &quot;Belle of Minnetonka&quot;, were quite large. The &quot;Belle of Minnetonka&quot; was long and could purportedly carry 2,500 passengers.

Wayzata was officially incorporated as a village in 1883. One of the village council&#x27;s first orders of business was to reroute the railroad tracks north of town. James J. Hill, who had become chairman of the newly formed Saint Paul, Minneapolis, &amp; Manitoba Railway in 1879, initially ignored the council&#x27;s order. When the council took the case to court, Hill reacted by demolishing the train station at the foot of Broadway Avenue and building a new one east of town at a stop called &quot;Holdridge.&quot; He declared that Wayzata residents could &quot;walk a mile for the next twenty years&quot; to catch the train. Hill moved the tracks as well, but rather than rerouting them north of town, he moved them closer to the lake.

Hill was also connected to Wayzata and Lake Minnetonka through the Arlington Hotel, Hotel Lafayette, and &quot;Belle of Minnetonka&quot;, all owned by the Saint Paul, Minneapolis, &amp; Manitoba Railway. He purchased Wayzata&#x27;s Arlington Hotel in 1881 and never reopened it. By the 1890s, Lake Minnetonka had largely fallen out of favor as a vacation destination for wealthy tourists. A number of factors including new railroad regulations, new vacation spots, and a national economic depression contributed to this decline.

===Cottage period===
As national tourism to Lake Minnetonka faded in the 1890s, a new era for Wayzata began. Many urban dwellers began to construct summer cottages along Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s shores as the Twin Cities grew. While many of these new cottages were modest, some were monumental. Wayzata became home to a large collection of grand country estates along the Ferndale Shore. Notable families who built country estates there include the Bells, Boveys, Crosbys, Peaveys, Pillsburys, and Washburns.

Despite the influx of new summer residences, Wayzata barely grew during this period. That changed in 1905, when the village council voted for a Reconciliation Ordinance to repair relations with Hill and his railway (now known as the “Great Northern”). He responded by building a new train depot near downtown Wayzata. At the depot&#x27;s grand opening celebration in 1906, he declared it the “handsomest” on the entire Great Northern line.

Wayzata was also connected to a new form of water transportation in 1906. The Twin City Rapid Transit Company launched six new “Express Boats” on Lake Minnetonka that served as an extension of the Twin City streetcar system. The service was discontinued in 1926 after several years of declining ridership. Some of the Express Boats were scuttled (purposely sunk) in the lake that year. One, the &quot;Minnehaha&quot;, was raised from the depths in 1980, restored, and returned to passenger service in 1996.

As the cottage era continued, downtown Wayzata rebounded with residences and small commercial centers at each end of Lake Street. Motorboating was all the rage by 1920, and Wayzata was at the center of the trend with two nationally famous boat makers, Ramaley and Wise, based there. In 1929 the Ramaley Boat Company merged with Wise Boat Works and Walker Boat Works to form Minnetonka Boat Works. Minnetonka Boat Works eventually became well-known manufacturers and distributors of Tonka-Craft and Chris-Craft power boats.

===20th century===
Wayzata&#x27;s population nearly doubled in the decades leading up to World War II. Wayzatans were fortunate when one of their own, Mayor Rufus Rand, stepped forward to lead the town in meeting the challenges of modernizing its infrastructure. Under Rand, water and sewer service was provided to every building, streetlights were installed, roads were paved, and the public beach and park was opened.

After World War II, many local farms and summer cottages were converted for use as year-round, single-family homes. Many new homes and gas stations were also constructed during this time. U.S. Highway 12, which was built in the 1920s, was widened to four lanes, and the population swelled. Downtown Wayzata residences were replaced by more stores serving not only Wayzatans, but also new families moving onto the former farmlands outside Wayzata. By the 1950s, the greater Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area had reached Wayzata.

After it became a charter city, Wayzata began to annex land from Minnetonka, Plymouth, and Orono, and doubled in size. U.S. Highway 12 was widened again to become a freeway in the 1970s and a new shopping center opened down the road. These physical and economic changes caused some of Wayzata&#x27;s downtown shops to be replaced by condominiums and office buildings. Strip malls and fast food franchises came to a part of the town near the highway.

==Geography==
Wayzata is a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota, to its west on the northeast tip of Lake Minnetonka. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. The &quot;land cover types&quot; that compose the Wayzata area in descending order by square acreage are open water (36%); residential areas, farmsteads, and commercial lands (35%); forest (13%); and farms (8%).

===Climate===

Average winter temperatures range from 2 to 27 degrees Fahrenheit. The average annual rainfall is . The average annual snowfall is .

===Ecology===

Before it was settled by Euro-Americans, the Wayzata area was largely &quot;upland deciduous forest, with small inclusions of wet prairie, and lakes.&quot; Forest types typical in and around Wayzata have been &quot;maple-basswood forest, oak forest, lowland hardwood forest, and floodplain forest. Non-native forest types within the city were predominantly disturbed second growth forest types made up of elm, box elder, ash, and cottonwood, with occasional basswood, maple, and oak.&quot; Some of the species of plants considered invasive in the Wayzata area are purple loosestrife, narrow-leaf cattail, common buckthorn, leafy spurge, tartarian honeysuckle, garlic mustard, reed canary grass, Siberian elm, and Amur maple. Some rare native species have also been seen in Wayzata, including the Acadian flycatcher, pugnose shiner, and red-shouldered hawk.

The first settlement at Black Hammer Township was made in 1852.

At the first town meeting on April 5, 1859, a motion was made to name the town &quot;Clinton.&quot; The state government rejected the name because there was already a Clinton, Minnesota. At a later date the name Black Hammer was decided upon as a partial translation of the Norwegian phrase &quot;Sort Hammer.&quot; A history of the county from 1882 tells the story of how the name came about:

Knud Olson Bergo, who was living just across the town line in Spring Grove, on getting up one morning, saw that a fire had swept over the prairie in the south part of the town...Its charred appearance at once suggested to his mind a certain bluff located in Slidre Valders, Norway, which was Mr. Bergo&#x27;s birthplace, and so he exclaiming in Norwegian, &quot;Sort Hammer,&quot; which signifies Black Bluff, and the people have had the good sense to retain the name to this day, which, it will be perceived, is composed of an English and a Norwegian word.

<text>Eitzen is a city in Houston County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 243 at the 2010 census.

==History==
A post office called Eitzen has been in operation since 1868. A share of the early settlers being natives of Eitzen, Germany, caused the name to be selected.

In September 2020, while visiting randomly selected households in Eitzen, a group of CDC officials claimed to have been confronted, and to have had their cars surrounded, by residents of houses who did not believe they were who they claimed to be; the incident was one of several that led to the discontinuation of the program. This account was disputed by mayor Jeff Adamson, who claimed the city was never informed about the plan to approach random households, and said &quot;I think they owe the city of Eitzen and its citizens an apology&quot;. He further said that &quot;a city official and two other residents responded to concerns about people going door-to-door in an unmarked car with California plates [...] Two vehicles driven by the city official and residents were parked on either side of the COVID-19 team&#x27;s vehicle, but it was never blocked.&quot;

<doc id="120235" wikidata="Q377521" url="?curid=120235" title="Hokah, Minnesota">
<text>Hokah ( ) is a city in Houston County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 580 at the 2010 census. Hokah is located near the confluence of the Root and Mississippi rivers, opposite La Crosse, Wisconsin.

==History==

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the area that is now the city of Hokah was a Native American settlement of the Dakota people. The city&#x27;s name, which is said to be a Native American word meaning gar fish or the Dakota name for the nearby Root River, derives from the chief of the settlement, Chief Wecheschatope Hokah. There were, at one time, more than thirty Indian mounds throughout the area including several effigy mounds, though most have been lost.

The first recorded European settler in Hokah was Edward Thompson, who arrived in 1851 with his wife and family and constructed a flour mill and dam on Thompson Creek, a tributary of the Root River that runs through the city and now bears his name. The first town meeting was held in 1858, and the town was officially incorporated into a village by the state of Minnesota on March 2, 1871.

By 1875, Hokah had several major industries including four flour mills, cooper shops and a railroad depot, driven by the city&#x27;s location on the navigable Root River near where it empties into the Mississippi River as well as the Root River Valley Railroad which ran through the north end of the village from nearby La Crescent to Rochester, Minnesota. The railroad depot was equipped for all types of railroad work, including the construction of railroad locomotives and coaches. The depot employed as many as 500 workers and constructed as many as 300 coaches in one year. As of 1880, Hokah also had a plow factory, a furniture factory, three blacksmith shops, a shoe shop, two drug stores, and six general stores.

In 1876, a railroad bridge was constructed across the Mississippi River from La Crosse, connecting the Root River Valley Railroad to the railroads across the river in La Crosse. In 1880, the Root River Valley Railroad was purchased by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and the railroad depot in Hokah was razed in favor of other facilities elsewhere, leaving several hundred workers without employment and causing many people to leave the area. Hokah&#x27;s other industries suffered from this loss of population and many of the other local businesses eventually closed.

On April 23, 1923, the village was reincorporated as a city. Hokah City Hall, built by the Works Progress Administration in 1938, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On August 19, 2007, 15.10 inches of rain fell in Hokah over a 24-hour period, breaking the previous 24-hour rainfall record for the state of Minnesota of 10.84 inches set on July 22, 1972 in Fort Ripley, Minnesota. This rainfall was part of the weather system that caused the 2007 Midwest flooding and caused widespread damage throughout Hokah and surrounding communities including landslides, damaged and destroyed homes, and washed-out roads. Hokah also holds the record for the most rainfall in any month for the state of Minnesota at 23.86 inches, also set in August, 2007.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.
Hokah&#x27;s location in the Driftless Area of southeastern Minnesota gives it a hilly landscape dominated by high bluffs and low river valleys known as coulees. The city&#x27;s downtown is set on a small bluff between the Root River valley and the Thompson Creek valley. At the east end of downtown is Thompson Bluff, also known as Mt. Tom, a bluff that rises more than 400 feet above downtown. Like Thompson Creek, Thompson Bluff is named for Edward Thompson.

===Como Falls===

Hokah was home to Como Falls, a waterfall on Thompson Creek. From 1858 until the 1930s Hokah was also home to Lake Como, a 90-acre, 20-foot deep man-made lake created by building a dam on Thompson Creek at Como Falls. Lake Como was a popular vacation spot in its heyday, drawing visitors from La Crosse and the surrounding area with lakeside cabins and boat rentals. The dam that created Lake Como failed during a flood in 1909 and allowed the lake to drain but was rebuilt in 1922. By the late 1930s, soil erosion from nearby farms prior to the widespread local use of contour plowing caused the lake bed to fill in, bringing about the end of Lake Como. Until August 2018, the site of Lake Como was used as a community park, pool, and baseball field. A severe storm in late August 2018 dumped almost eight inches of rain in the area in less than 24 hours, causing massive damage to the park and rerouting the path of water around the rock formation that made up Como Falls, basically destroying the falls. In the following months, local and state parties&#x27; funding was allocated to rebuilding the route for water that creates Como Falls.
==Transportation==

Hokah is located approximately six miles west-southwest of downtown La Crosse, Wisconsin, or about nine miles by automobile via the Mississippi River Bridge in La Crescent.

Minnesota State Highway 44 passes directly through downtown Hokah and has its northern terminus at an intersection with Minnesota State Highway 16 northeast of downtown. Minnesota State Highway 16 passes just north of downtown. Minnesota State Highway 26, which follows the Mississippi River and serves as part of the Great River Road, passes just to the east of Hokah.

Two nearby motor vehicle bridges span the Mississippi River and connect the southeastern corner of Minnesota to the La Crosse area in Wisconsin: six miles north of Hokah, the Mississippi River Bridge carries U.S. routes 14 and 61 and connects downtown La Crescent, Minnesota to downtown La Crosse, Wisconsin, and eight miles north of Hokah, the I-90 Mississippi River Bridge in Dresbach carries Interstate 90 across the Mississippi River to northern La Crosse and Onalaska, Wisconsin. South of Hokah, the nearest place for vehicles to cross the Mississippi River is at the Black Hawk Bridge, thirty miles away in Lansing, Iowa.

The nearby La Crosse Amtrak station provides daily service for the Empire Builder Amtrak route, and the La Crosse Regional Airport provides daily service to Chicago and Minneapolis via American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.

==History==
The city of Akeley was incorporated on December 30, 1916. It was largely developed by a partnership between lumber magnate T. B. Walker and Healy C.

The mill was once the largest in the state of Minnesota. Thomas B. Walker had intended to build the mill in what would later become Walker, Minnesota, but chose Akeley instead because of his wife&#x27;s disapproval of the bars and brothels in the Walker area.

Because of the mill, and the train depot built in 1899, Akeley became a boomtown. Lumberjacks came and went on every freight train. The population swelled from 2,000 to over 3,500 between 1907 and 1908. Now the town has fewer than 500 residents.

<text>Bergen () is a municipality and a town in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. Its North Sea beaches and forests make it a popular destination for tourists. In 2001, the municipality was formed from a merger of the former municipalities of Egmond, Schoorl, and the smaller community of Bergen proper that had existed since 1811.

Since about 1900, Bergen has been the home of many painters, writers and architects. Some of the work of this &quot;Bergen School&quot; is on exhibit at Museum Kranenburgh. The neighbourhood of Park Meerwijk, constructed in 1915, is made up entirely of villas in Amsterdam School style. There are regular art fairs in Bergen, as well as an annual music festival (the Holland Music Sessions in August) and arts festival (the Kunsttiendaagse in October).

North of the town of Bergen are the Schoorlse Duinen, a nature area with the highest and widest dunes of the Netherlands, which reach about 59m (195 ft) above sea level, and are more than wide in some places.

Other points of interest in the municipality include the aquarium in the seaside village of Bergen aan Zee, the Auto Union Museum in Bergen with a collection of classic cars, and the historical museums Het Sterkenhuis (Bergen) and Museum van Egmond (Egmond aan Zee).

The town of Bergen has been home to the European School, Bergen, since 1963. In July 2021, the decision was made to move the school to Alkmaar. 

==Population centres==

The municipality of Bergen consists of the following towns, villages and/or districts: Bergen, Aagtdorp, Bergen aan Zee, Bregtdorp, Camperduin, Catrijp, Egmond aan den Hoef, Egmond aan Zee, Egmond-Binnen, Groet, Hargen, Rinnegom, Schoorl, Schoorldam (partly), Wimmenum.

==History==

The Egmond Abbey, founded in the 10th century, became the most important cultural center of medieval Holland. The abbey was protected by the House of Egmond, which eventually became a powerful noble family. The three towns of Egmond have also been mentioned since the 10th century. Both the Egmond Abbey and Egmond Castle in Egmond aan den Hoef were destroyed in 1573 on order of William the Silent during the Dutch Revolt.

The town of Bergen developed around a chapel and is mentioned as far back as the tenth century. An old local legend is the &quot;Miracle of Bergen&quot;, which is said to have occurred during the St. Elisabeth&#x27;s Flood of 1421. The story goes that the &quot;schout&quot; (sheriff) of Bergen found a chest containing hosts (the thin wafers used in Holy Communion) from the church of Petten which had floated to Bergen during the flood. The seawater that penetrated the chest had turned into blood. There is also a second miracle story, thought to have occurred in 1422, whereby hosts turned into blood. On the site where the miracle of Bergen is said to have happened, a chapel was erected. Bergen became a place of pilgrimage, and Roman-Catholic processions were held at the site for centuries and continue today.

In the fifteenth century, the Ruïnekerk (&quot;Ruined Church&quot;) was built on the site of the chapel and at the time was the largest of its kind in the province of North Holland. In 1574, during the Eighty Years War against Spain, the church was looted and burned down by Dutch Protestants, but was later rebuilt to its current state.

In 1797, the Battle of Camperdown, a major naval action between the British and Batavian (Dutch) fleets, was fought off the coast of Camperduin, part of the municipality of Bergen. It was the most significant action between British and Dutch forces during the French Revolutionary Wars and resulted in a complete victory for the British, who captured 11 Dutch ships without losing any of their own. And in 1799, a British-Russian army invaded North-Holland. At Bergen, a battle with the French-Batavian armies took place on 19 September. The Russisch Monument in Bergen commemorates this Battle of Bergen.

Bergen was one of the main stations on the narrow-gauge railway between Alkmaar and Bergen aan Zee, which ran between 1905 and 1955. One of the locomotives which operated on this line, &#x27;Bello&#x27; stood for many years in the town centre as a memorial, and is now preserved at the Museumstoomtram Hoorn - Medemblik.

<text>Stanford Township is a township in Isanti County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 2,075 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Stanford had a post office from &quot;circa&quot; 1898 to 1901, a sawmill on the creek that lay about a mile south of the town, and a school on a site of directly across from the post office. The school existed from approximately 1890 until 1945, when it was converted into a private residence. The school was burned because it was in vast disrepair in 1995, and was replaced with a new home. This community was settled by primarily English settlers from the Eastern United States, although Germans and Scandinavians followed. The town was never more than a farming community or crossroads community- the last remnant was the country school.

===Today===
Today, there is no evidence of anything ever being at the site, except for two homes that sit on lots removed from larger parcels, which are common in this rural area. Sullivan Woods Trail has increasingly become upscale, with large homes in the ancient burr oak forest, with many residents being exurban commuters and residents, in contrast to the original population.

The Squaw Lake area was inhabited by Ojibwe people prior to the arrival of European colonizers. The land was set aside for the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe in 19th century treaties as part of the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. Early on it was a hub for fur traders and loggers. It was later the site of a Great Northern Railway station. A post office was established there by 1923 and it was incorporated as a village in 1940.

The lake located to the east of the town was renamed from Squaw Lake to Nature&#x27;s Lake in 1995 by the Minnesota Legislature following a campaign led by students from Cass Lake-Bena High School. The term &quot;squaw&quot; is an ethnic and sexual slur. The Leech Lake Name Change Committee attempted to introduce a referendum on changing the town&#x27;s name in November 2000, but did not have enough valid signatures for its petition.

<text>Taconite ( ) is a city in Itasca County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 651 at the 2020 census.

U.S. Highway 169 serves as a main route in the community.

==History==
Taconite was established in 1907 and is one of several whistlestop cities located on Highway 169 collectively known as &#x27;Range Cities&#x27;. These cities were branded as such when they sprang up in parallel with the nearby iron mining operations that began in Coleraine and headed in a northeasterly direction. The mines and cities comprise part of what is known as Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range, specifically the Mesabi Range.

Taconite is a derivation of the word Taconic, which is related to the Taconic Mountains of the eastern United States and contain similar geologic formations. &#x27;Taconic&#x27; is based on a Native American word, documented in use as early as 1685, and spelled a number of ways including:

- Tachkanick 
- Taghconic
- K&#x27;takantshan 
- Tachanizen
- Tackinick 
- Tocconuc
- Taughkaughnick 
- Taghonic
- Toghconnuck 
- Taconick
- Toghconnuc 
- Tacon&#x27;ic 
- Taghkan&#x27;nuc 
- Taconyte
- Taghkanick 
and - Tac&#x27;onite

Taconite abuts what was originally called the Holman Mine, with independently operated mines located on either side of the city.

With closure of the mines, the withdrawal of dewatering equipment led to rain, runoff and underground springs raising water levels in the nearby mine pits. The abandoned pits that surround Taconite – including the Holman Mine—have been filled and joined into what is now called the Canisteo Mine complex.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Taconite is located adjacent to the Cannisteo mine pit. It was established in 1907 and refers to itself as the &quot;Hub of the Nation&quot;.

<doc id="120356" wikidata="Q1916787" url="?curid=120356" title="Trout Lake Township, Itasca County, Minnesota">
<text>Trout Lake Township is located in north central Minnesota in Itasca County, United States. It is bordered by the City of Coleraine to the west and north, City of Bovey on the north, an unorganized township on the east, and Blackberry Township to the south. Town government was adopted on March 6, 1894. The population was 1,056 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
In 1870, Trout Lake Township, or 55 N Range 24 W of the 4th PM (principal meridian), was surveyed as part of the Public Land Survey System. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 34.7 square miles (89.8 km), of which 30.5 square miles (79.1 km) is land and 4.1 square miles (10.7 km), or 11.91%, is water. The Swan River and several lakes are within the township of which Trout Lake is the largest at 1862.08 acres with a maximum depth of 135 feet. The land sits in the Laurentian Mixed Forest Province, defined by a mixture of deciduous and coniferous forests. It is on top of the western portion of the Mesabi Iron Range.

==Natural resources==
=== Timber ===
Logging in Trout Lake Township corresponds with the exhibits and re-enactments at the Minnesota Forest History Center, a site just 10 miles distant. The 1890s to 1910 was the &quot;golden era&quot; of lumbering in Minnesota. According to local interviews archived at the Iron Range Research Center, there were logging camps in the township. Settlers worked to provide railroad ties.

Today, private landowners are encouraged to manage the forest through organizations such as the Minnesota Forestry Association, and to enroll in Woodland Stewardship Plans. Itasca County, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, manages tax forfeited public properties in Trout Lake Township for timber; cover type aspen-birch.

=== Iron ore ===
Iron ore was processed into taconite at the Trout Lake Washing and Concentrator Plant, 1907-1970. The plant, and the adjacent Trout Lake, provided it with a convenient location to deposit its tailings, which were pumped into the lake for nearly three decades.

The Oliver Iron Mining Company&#x27;s concentrator plant, its power station on the lake, and the workers&#x27; Bugaloosa location, are now gone. The history continues to qualify Trout Lake Township for Taconite Assistance and Tax Relief, and for benefits from the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board.

=== Water ===
The natural water system is in the Prairie-Willow Subbasin, of the Mississippi Headwaters Basin, within the Upper Mississippi Region. It is in Supervisor District 4 of the Itasca County Soil and Water Conservation District. Besides several creeks and Swan River, there are seven protected lakes. Each has a distinguishing number in the state’s identification system. The lakes are:
* #310206 Mud at 69.67 acres with a maximum depth of 5 feet 
* #310207 Bass at 100 acres with 16 feet maximum
* #310208 Sampson at 17.24 acres (depth unknown)
* #310209 Round at 100.61 acres with 16 feet maximum
* #310210 Blackberry at 254 acres with 20 feet maximum
* #310214 Clearwater at 131.59 acres with 16 feet maximum
* #310216 Trout at 1862.08 with 135 feet maximum
Bass, Clearwater, and Round lakes are classified by Itasca County as &quot;phosphorus sensitive lakes&quot;. Blackberry and Mud lakes are on the state&#x27;s inventory for wild rice. Trout lake has not had trout species since the 1940s. It is classified as a Cisco Refuge Lake because it has deep, cold water.

The state maintains a boat landing on the southeast end of Trout Lake. It adjoins a campground that was previously a public park. Historically, the park was for company picnics of the Oliver Mining Company. It transferred to Greenway Lions Club and developed into Kom-On-In Beach and Recreation Area with the aid of Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board. After approximately half a century, the property was sold and is now Trout Lake RV Park and Campground.

=== Wildlife ===
Fishing, hunting and trapping are regulated by federal and state laws, managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR), and enforced by MN DNR conservation officers and Itasca County Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

Alder Pond Ruffed Grouse Management Area and recreation trail system are on 190 acres located between town sections 29 and 32. It is managed by Itasca County, with Grand Rapids Ruffed Grouse Society and MN DNR as partners. The public trails are used for hiking, horseback riding, and hunting, plus 6.03 miles are groomed by Northern Lights Nordic Ski Club for cross-country skiing.

Trout Lake Eagle Wildlife Management Area preserves three eagle nests and several potential white pine nesting trees. The area is one of the longest known bald eagle nesting sites in Minnesota. Two parcels of undeveloped land (located on opposite sides of Trout Lake) were purchased by a joint effort of MN DNR Nongame Wildlife Program, Reinvest In Minnesota (RIM) and the Nature Conservancy.

==Community==
=== Demographics ===
The Minnesota State Demographic Center estimated the 2019 population of Trout Lake Township at 1093 people in 455 households. The 2020 US Census found the population at 1056 in 491 households. 5.4% were below the poverty level in 2020 compared to 11.5% the year before the US 2010 census. The residents of Trout Lake Township are 98.6% white. When the United States 2010 census was taken, none had been born outside of the country, and 80% had been born in Minnesota. 20.6% of the people within the marrying age (ages 15 and over) had never been married. 25.2% of residents ages 25 and over had some college or an associate&#x27;s degree.

=== Town government ===
The settlers in the geographic township of Trout Lake, on March 6, 1894, organized themselves into a political township. The township became a public corporation, according to Minn. Stat. § 365.02, with governing authority granted by the state legislature. The first supervisors were N. Washburn, C.S. Brock, and August Keihta; clerk F.H. Webster; and treasurer, Robert Smith. Their first priority was building roads.

With town government, residents decide at the annual town meeting, held on the second Tuesday of March, what the town levy will be, and to approve actions to be taken by the town board. The residents may also call special town meetings to address concerns. The Trout Lake town board meets at least monthly to oversee over 20 miles of township roads, two cemeteries, and a community center on ten acres with a playground, pavilion, and ball field. The town supervisors also represent the community on county committees, and joint powers associations. Trout Lake is also a voting precinct and administers a polling place at the Trout Lake Community Center.

=== Basic rural services ===
9-1-1 emergency calls are directed to the appropriate agency for help. Trout Lake Township is patrolled by Itasca County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The town contracts with both Trout Lake Fire Department and Grand Rapids Fire Department. The majority of rural mail delivery is provided by the US Post Office in Bovey, and a southern portion, by the US Post Office in Grand Rapids; hence mailing addresses are zip codes 55709 or 55744 respectively. The community is connected by a network of county and township roads. The main thoroughfares are Trout Lake Road (#21), County Road 10, and County Road 71.

The rural community of Trout Lake supports the economic and social infrastructure of its surrounding cities. There are not any active schoolhouses, churches, stores, or industries in the township. The township is within these service areas for amenities:
* Electricity from Lake Country Power, a Touchstone Energy Cooperative that purchases electricity from Great River Energy.
* Broadband from Paul Bunyan Communications, a telecommunication cooperative, that offers optic fiber internet connection to every house.
* Public transportation from Arrowhead Transit.
* Public education from Greenway School System #316, Grand Rapids School System #318, Itasca Area Community Education, and the Arrowhead Public Library System.
* Public healthcare, home-care, and social services are administered by Itasca County Public Health, Elder Circle, and Kootasca Community Action.

==Culture==
Wawina has the distinction of having America&#x27;s smallest telephone company. Northern Telephone Company of Minnesota (Area Code 218-488) serves fewer than 40 subscribers.

It gained brief fame as the last place in the continental United States to use a trunking system (inter-office circuits) that was called &quot;N2 Carrier&quot;, an analog system that utilized Multi-Frequency (MF) tones and the notorious 2600 Hz control tone for answer supervision and idle trunk condition. This system was much loved by phone phreaks as it was the same system which the now infamous John Draper made famous. The era ended in June 2006, when the privately owned exchange switched to a digital trunk. Phone hacking attempts from across the nation had placed a large burden on the extremely small telephone company serving the township.

<text>Jackson is a city in and the county seat of Jackson County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 3,323 at the 2020 census.

==History==
For centuries, many indigenous peoples called this area home, including the Cheyenne, Ioway, and Dakota tribes. In 1851, the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux opened the region to white settlement in exchange for government payments.

Jackson was originally called Springfield, and was laid out under that name in 1856. The first settlers in what is now Jackson County—William, George, and Charles Wood—established a trading post near the Des Moines River around the same time. A post office called Jackson has been in operation since 1858.

On March 26, 1857, the Wahpekute Dakota Chief Inkpaduta and his band attacked the settlement in the Spirit Lake Massacre. There were 11 able-bodied men in Springfield, and three men, three children, and a woman died in the attack. Also lost to the raiders were 12 horses, dry goods, lead and powder. The attack&#x27;s sole survivor was 14-year-old Abbie Gardner. Terrified of a possible second attack, the beleaguered residents abandoned the area.

Two months later, the Minnesota legislature organized the area into a county, naming it after Saint Paul merchant Henry Jackson. The temporary county seat was at the townsite of Springfield, now renamed Jackson. But the area was still depopulated, and resettlement was slow due to continued hostility. In August 1862, the Dakota, angry at late payments from the government, skirmished with settlers; one such skirmish compelled some Dakota leaders to attack government buildings in the Minnesota River, starting the U.S.-Dakota War. By August 24, the war&#x27;s effects had reached Jackson County. Warriors raided a community of Norwegian immigrants in Belmont Township, north of Jackson, killing 13 and wounding three. As in 1857, the remaining settlers fled, leaving Jackson County depopulated again.

After the Civil War, resettlement in Jackson County began again. A stockade was built on the east side of the river, encouraging further immigration. Immigrants came mainly from northern and central Europe. They built homes from native timber and prairie sod. Life remained difficult; there were no wagon roads, no bridges, no churches, and only one school. The threat of attack remained, and the region was susceptible to disasters, including prairie fires, severe blizzards, crop failures, and plagues of grasshoppers. But the pioneers survived and helped establish the agricultural and industrial community Jackson is today.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

The city lies along Interstate 90, which runs east to west the entire width of Minnesota. Interstate 90 and U.S. Highway 71 are two of the main routes in the city. Jackson is near the center of Jackson County. To the south is the Iowa Lakes region, which comprises Spirit Lake, West Okoboji Lake, and several other small lakes.

<doc id="120385" wikidata="Q2182386" url="?curid=120385" title="Okabena, Minnesota">
<text>Okabena ( ) is a town in Jackson County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 203 at the 2020 census. The community&#x27;s name is a Dakota term meaning &quot;the nesting place of herons.&quot;

== History ==
Okabena was founded in 1879 after the railroad had been extended to that point. A post office has been in operation at Okabena since 1880.

===Bank robbery===

On May 19, 1933, the Okabena Bank was robbed by Bonnie and Clyde. After leaving the bank, the outlaws&#x27; car sped through Okabena, spraying the town with machine-gun fire. Schoolchildren ducked behind trees and bullets sliced through walls and shattered windows. They escaped on a country road with approximately $2500 (approximately $44,000 in 2013 dollars). Three other people (Tony, Floyd and Mildred Strain) were sent to prison for the crime, and it was not recognized for many years that the real robbers were the infamous Bonnie and Clyde Gang.

====Investigation and trial====
In 1933 alone, 32 banks were robbed in Minnesota. The FBI did not investigate bank robberies until 1934, so the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) and the Jackson County Sheriff were responsible for solving the crime. Agent William Conly of the Minnesota BCA was provided with eyewitness descriptions matching the appearances of Tony and Floyd Strain. The description of the incident also described a woman involved as the get away driver, who was presumed to be Mildred Strain and later matched by eyewitnesses. They were local criminals who were suspected in a number of other local bank heists. After two quick trials, they were convicted by Jackson County juries, and Tony and Floyd were sentenced to 10–80 years and Mildred was sentenced to 5–40 years, as she was only the getaway driver, a less serious offence.

The trio were also suspected of robbing banks in the Minnesota towns of Chandler, Ihlen, Madison, Russell and Westbrook and the South Dakota towns of Canova, Vermillion, Kaylor and Huron. However, events in later years made clear that the trio could not have been responsible for those other bank robberies. Mildred insisted she was framed for the Okabena robbery until the day she was released from Shakopee Women’s Prison in 1942. Moreover, two officers of the Sioux City, Iowa police department later claimed they were watching her at her residence on the day of the robbery. Tony and Floyd also maintained their innocence until they were released from Stillwater Penitentiary in 1946.

====Later evidence====

Years after Bonnie and Clyde had died, a book was ghost-written by Bonnie&#x27;s mother and Clyde&#x27;s sister, claiming that Bonnie and Clyde had robbed the bank in Okabena, along with Clyde&#x27;s brother Buck Barrow and Buck&#x27;s wife Blanche Barrow. Another book written by Blanch Barrow made the same claim.

Shortly before the Okabena robbery, police in Joplin, Missouri raided a house used by Bonnie and Clyde as a hide-out. In the house they found undeveloped rolls of film of Bonnie and Clyde brandishing pistols and machine guns, along with several poems of their exploits written by Bonnie. The poems and the photos were later published in newspapers, making the pair famous, but by this time, the Strains had been convicted.

The Strain trio maintained their innocence, right up to their deaths, Tony in 1970, Mildred in 1974, and Floyd in 1994. The town of Okabena now recognizes the real robbers, and re-enacts the bank heist every year as part of their Fourth of July festival.

According to Professor Brad Chislom, historian at St. Cloud State University, “Bonnie and Clyde, along with Buck and Blanche Barrow, robbed the bank at Okabena. The residents of Jackson County who helped convict the Strains no doubt acted in good faith; vital information had been concealed from them. Bank robberies were occurring at an alarming rate in 1933. At Okabena, over-zealous, dishonest investigators placed a higher value on clearing the rash of cases than on getting at the truth, and the Strains paid the price. Only history can clear their names now.”

<text>Wilder is a city in Jackson County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 62 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Wilder was founded in 1885. It was named for Amherst Holcomb Wilder, a railroad official. Wilder was incorporated as a city in 1899. A post office was established in Wilder in 1886, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1991.

The Breck School was established in Wilder in 1886. It was the first of many Breck campuses subsequently built throughout Minnesota. The school was named after the Reverend James Lloyd Breck, known as &quot;The Apostle of the Wilderness&quot; for his work in establishing mission schools for indigenous peoples in Wisconsin and Minnesota. The Wilder Campus was built to serve children of local farmers whose one-room school education left them unprepared to attend regular high schools. Room, board, and tuition for a year cost $110. Classes began in late September and ended in March. This allowed farm students to return home to assist with spring planting duties. Classes included penmanship, grammar, and arithmetic, but also included such advanced topics as Greek, rhetoric, chemistry, and physics. The Breck School in Wilder closed in 1909, and was reestablished in St Paul in 1916. Breck’s campus today is in Golden Valley, Minnesota.

Franklin Clarence Mars known as Frank, attended the Breck School in Wilder, MN from 1899 to 1900. Mars later gained fame as the founder of the Mars Candy Company. In 1988, the Mars family was ranked as the richest family in the United States of America by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine.
