<text>East Windsor is a township in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located at the cross-roads between the Delaware Valley region to the southwest and the Raritan Valley region to the northeast, the township is an outer-ring suburb of New York City in the New York Metropolitan area, as defined by the United States Census Bureau, but directly borders the Philadelphia metropolitan area and is part of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Philadelphia Designated Market Area. Since East Windsor is situated at the confluence of several major highways that serve both the major cities of New York City and Philadelphia, and even the local commercial hubs of nearby Freehold, Princeton, and the state capital of Trenton, the community has been a longtime residential, commercial, and industrial hub in the heart of Central New Jersey.

As of the 2020 United States census, East Windsor&#x27;s population was 30,045, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 2,855 (+10.5%) from the 27,190 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,271 (+9.1%) from the 24,919 counted in the 2000 census.

Both East Windsor and West Windsor were formed when Windsor Township was split on February 9, 1797, while the area was still part of Middlesex County. It was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships. Portions of the township were taken to form Hightstown borough (March 5, 1853, within East Windsor; became independent ) and Washington Township (March 11, 1860, and known as Robbinsville Township since 2007). The township was named for Windsor Township, which was named for Windsor, England.

Twin Rivers (2010 Census population of 7,443) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within East Windsor Township. According to &quot;New Jersey: A Guide to the State&quot; by Barbara Westergaard, Twin Rivers was &quot;New Jersey&#x27;s first planned unit development&quot; and &quot;has attracted the scrutiny of countless researchers, from sociologists and anthropologists to specialists in energy conservation.&quot; Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located completely or partially within East Windsor include Allens Station, Eilers Corner, Etra, Hickory Corner, Locust Corner, Millstone and Washington Oak.

The township borders Robbinsville Township and West Windsor Township in Mercer County; Cranbury Township, Monroe Township and Plainsboro Township in Middlesex County; and both Millstone Township and Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County. East Windsor completely surrounds the independent borough of Hightstown, making it part one of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.

==Government==

===Local government===

East Windsor has been governed since 1970 within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Council-Manager form of government. The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The council is comprised of seven members elected at-large for four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either three or four seats up for vote in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election. In a reorganization meeting held each January, the council selects a mayor and a deputy mayor from among its members for a one-year term.

, members of the East Windsor Council are Mayor Janice S. Mironov (D, term on council ends December 31, 2027; term as mayor ends 2025), Deputy Mayor David Russell (D, term on council and as deputy mayor ends 2025), Denise Daniels (D, 2025), Anthony Katawick (D, 2027), Marc Lippman (D, 2027), Johnnie Whittington (D, 2025; elected to serve an unexpired term) and John Zoller (D, 2027).

Johnnie Whittington was appointed to fill a seat expiring in December 2025 that became vacant following the death of Alan Rosenberg and served on an interim basis until the November 2023 election when he was chosen by voters to serve the balance of the term of office.

In December 2015, the Township Council appointed Denise Daniels to fill the seat expiring in December 2017 that became vacant following the death of Hector Duke earlier that month.

Designed during the 1970s energy crisis and constructed in 1982, the township&#x27;s municipal building was erected within a landscaped man-made hill, with only its south side exposed. The design allows the building to maintain a comfortable climate inside for most of the year, with greatly reduced energy needs. The passive solar design allows the building to reduce energy consumption by 60% compared to conventional office buildings of the same size.

==== Cyber breach ====

On February 24, 2022, the computer servers of the East Windsor Municipal Offices were breached. Numerous residents contacted the Township to report the issue, which went unacknowledged for nearly two weeks. East Windsor officials said they first became aware of a municipal cyber breach on March 7, but a letter confirming receipt of an insurance claim contains a loss date from six days earlier. The &quot;Windsor-Hights Herald&quot; contacted Mayor Mironov by email March 7 and March 14 for comment and explanation, but she did not respond. By March 17, the Township was still attempting to restore operations. Several residents who were professional IT managers and cybersecurity experts offered to assist for free, but were never contacted back by the township. Two months after the initial incident, Township officials had not divulged who was behind the hack or any of the steps taken to prevent future incidents. On May 9, a local cybersecurity expert filed a 13-item Open Public Records Act request with the Township, including requests for &quot;All documentation as to the scope and nature of the incident that is currently known” and “all documentation as to what personal records were released”. Those records were received on May 19 by the resident and the &quot;Windsor-Hights Herald&quot;. The records contradicted the timeline provided by the Township. The incident received national and international coverage, as it was reported nationally by MSN. It was reported on NJ.com on May 10 that while the Township had claimed to first be aware of the breach on March 7, the Township had actually submitted an insurance claim six days earlier. On May 26, it was reported that unauthorized access to the system also allowed access to certain data relating to individuals associated with the township. It was reported on May 31, 2022, that Township Manager Jim Brady received an email March 2 from a cyber threat intelligence analyst from the New Jersey Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Cell (NJCCIC), which stated that the agency&#x27;s email security tool had picked up a few emails that used a display name to spoof—or impersonate—East Windsor Township email users. Brady replied March 3 to the cyber threat intelligence analyst, and wrote that the Township was aware of the issue despite the later claim that the Township was not yet aware of the incident It was also reported that over 900 people have had their personal information compromised—potentially including their birth date, driver&#x27;s license and social security number—following the cyber breach.

<text>Ewing Township is a township in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township falls within the New York metropolitan area as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. It borders the Philadelphia metropolitan area and is part of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Philadelphia Designated Market Area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 37,264, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 1,474 (+4.1%) from the 35,790 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 83 (+0.2%) from the 35,707 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==

The earliest inhabitants of present-day Ewing Township in the historic era were Lenni Lenape Native Americans, who lived along the banks of the Delaware River. Their pre-colonial subsistence activities in the area included hunting, fishing, pottery-making, and simple farming. European settlers, mostly from the British Isles, began to colonize the area in 1699. One of the earliest European settlers was William Green, and his 1717 farmhouse still stands on the campus of The College of New Jersey.

The area that is now Ewing Township was part of Hopewell Township in what was a very large Burlington County at the beginning of the 18th century. In 1714 Hopewell was removed from Burlington County and added to Hunterdon County. By 1719, the area which was to become Ewing Township had been removed from Hopewell Township and added to the newly created Trenton Township. Portions of Trenton Township were incorporated as Ewing Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 22, 1834, posthumously honoring Charles Ewing for his work as Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. The township became part of the newly created Mercer County on February 22, 1838. After incorporation, Ewing Township received additional territory taken from Lawrence Township and the city of Trenton in 1858. In 1894 the city of Trenton took back some of that territory, annexing more in 1900.

When Ewing Township was incorporated in the 19th century, it was primarily farmland with a handful of scattered hamlets, including Carleton (now known as Ewing), Cross Keys (now known as Ewingville), Birmingham (now known as West Trenton) and Greensburg (now known as Wilburtha). Since the beginning of the 20th century, the township has developed as a suburb of Trenton. The sections near the city border are distinctly urban, but most of the township is suburban residential development. The main commercial district extends along North Olden Avenue Extension (County Route 622), originally constructed to connect north Trenton residences with the now-closed General Motors Inland Fisher Guide Plant. Ewing Township today is the location of The College of New Jersey, the Community Blood Council of New Jersey, New Jersey State Police headquarters, the Jones Farm State Correction Institute, the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital, the New Jersey Department of Transportation headquarters, the Maria H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf and Trenton-Mercer Airport.

From 1953 until 1997, Ewing was the home of Naval Air Warfare Center Trenton, encompassing on Parkway Avenue. It was used by the United States Navy as a jet engine test facility until its closure based on the recommendations of the 1993 Base Closure and Realignment Commission. Nearly 700 civilian positions were eliminated, most of which were relocated to other facilities in Maryland and Tennessee. The base&#x27;s Marine operations were transferred to Fort Dix, which has since become Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. A charity to end homelessness acquired the base at no cost in October 2013 in a process involving the United States Department of Defense, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Mercer County and Ewing Township.

The first location of an industrial robot used to replace human workers was at Ewing&#x27;s Inland Fisher Guide Plant in 1961, a facility that operated in the township for 1938 to 1998, after which the plant was demolished and targeted for redevelopment.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 15.56 square miles (40.29 km2), including 15.21 square miles (39.38 km2) of land and 0.35 square miles (0.90 km2) of water (2.24%).

The highest elevation in Ewing Township is AMSL just southeast of Interstate 295 and just west of Trenton-Mercer Airport, while the lowest point is just below AMSL along the Delaware River near the border with Trenton.

The largest body of water completely within the township is Lake Sylva, a man-made lake that was created in the 1920s when an earthen dam was constructed across the Shabakunk Creek. The lake is located on the campus of The College of New Jersey. Watercourses in Ewing include the Delaware River along its western boundary and the Shabakunk Creek in the eastern and central portions of the township.

The township has a number of distinct neighborhoods, including Agasote, Altura, Arbor Walk, Braeburn Heights, Briarcrest, Briarwood, Cambridge Hall, Churchill Green, Delaware Rise, Ewing, Ewing Park, Ewingville, Fernwood, Ferry Road Manor, Fleetwood Village, Glendale, Green Curve Heights, Hampton Hills, Heath Manor, Hickory Hill Estates, Hillwood Lakes, Hillwood Manor, Mountainview, Parkway Village, Prospect Heights, Prospect Park, Scudders Falls, Shabakunk Hills, Sherbrooke Manor, Somerset, Spring Meadows, Spring Valley, Village on the Green, Weber Park, West Trenton, Whitewood Estates, Wilburtha and Wynnewood Manor. Some of these existed before suburbanization, while others came into existence with the suburban development of the township in the 20th century.

The township borders the municipalities of Hopewell Township, Lawrence Township, Trenton in Mercer County; and Lower Makefield Township, Upper Makefield Township and Yardley in Bucks County across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.

<doc id="125379" wikidata="Q235644" url="?curid=125379" title="Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire">
<text>Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (née Spencer; ; 7 June 1757 – 30 March 1806), was an English aristocrat, socialite, prodigious and addicted gambler, political organiser, author, and activist. Born into the Spencer family, married into the Cavendish family, she was the first wife of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, and the mother of the 6th Duke of Devonshire.

The Duchess was famous for her charisma, political influence, beauty, unusual marital arrangement, love affairs, socializing, and notoriety for her gambling addiction, leading to an immense debt. She was the great-great-great-grandaunt of Diana, Princess of Wales. Their lives, two centuries apart, have been compared in tragedy.

==Early life and family==

The Duchess was born Miss Georgiana Spencer, on 7 June 1757, as the first child of John Spencer (later Earl Spencer) and his wife, Georgiana (née Poyntz, later Countess Spencer), at the Spencer family home, Althorp. After her daughter&#x27;s birth, her mother Lady Spencer wrote that &quot;I will own I feel so partial to my Dear little Gee, that I think I never shall love another so well.&quot; Two younger siblings followed: Henrietta (&quot;Harriet&quot;) and George. The daughter of her sister Henrietta, Lady Caroline Lamb, would become a writer and lover of Lord Byron. John Spencer, a great-grandson of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, came from a wealthy English noble family. He built Spencer House as a family residence at St. James&#x27;s, London, and raised his children there. Lord and Lady Spencer had what was considered an unusually happy and demonstrably affectionate marriage for the era, raising their children according to the &quot;modern&quot; and enlightened ideas of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Georgiana was the family favourite and had an extraordinary close bond with her mother, who confessed to favouring her over her other children, but this stability ended abruptly when she was separated from her parents when they traveled to Italy for her father&#x27;s health. While her mother admitted it was &quot;difficult&quot; to leave her behind, her primary devotion was to her husband, rather than her children. This abandonment was a profound shock to Georgiana, who became noticeably anxious to please and emotionally dependent on those around her.

When her father assumed the title of Viscount Spencer in 1761, she became The Honourable Georgiana Spencer. In 1765, her father became Earl Spencer, and she Lady Georgiana Spencer.

In 1766, the death of the Spencers&#x27; fourth child, soon after her first birthday, and then the loss of another daughter after only a few weeks just three years later, started an era of obsessive travelling and gambling as they sought distraction from their &quot;heavy affliction.&quot; Georgiana’s mother attempted to balance the worldly vice of gambling until dawn with self-denial and good works, but was aware, as were others, that this obsession was not based on a real religious devotion. The gambling that absorbed both her troubled parents&#x27; attention and became a household routine would become a pervasive influence for the rest of Georgiana&#x27;s life.

==Marriage and children==
On her seventeenth birthday, 7 June 1774, Lady Georgiana Spencer was married to society&#x27;s most eligible bachelor, William Cavendish, the 5th Duke of Devonshire, who was nine years her senior. The wedding took place at Wimbledon Parish Church. It was a small ceremony attended only by her parents, her paternal grandmother Lady Cowper, one of her prospective brothers-in-law, and her soon-to-be sister-in-law, the Duchess of Portland. Her parents were reluctant to let their daughter go, and while she was now married to one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the land, still attempted to exert their parental influence and keep her emotionally dependent on them. Her father, who had always shown affection to his children, wrote to her, &quot;But indeed my Dearest Georgiana, I did not know until lately how much I loved you; I miss you every day and every hour.&quot; The bond between Georgiana and her mother continued after her marriage in a lifelong correspondence; many of their letters survive.

Unlike her mother, Georgiana had not been out in society for several seasons, nor had she accepted the Duke because she loved and preferred him to all others. The Duke of Devonshire, referred to as &quot;the Duke&quot; by his family and friends, was a notoriously reserved and taciturn man, described as being “incapable of any strong emotion, and destitute of all energy and activity of mind.” Primarily motivated to please her parents with an illustrious marriage, Georgiana believed that Duke’s outward detachment might conceal a loving personality similar to her introverted father’s, and that in their marriage she would be both wife and companion. She was sadly mistaken; although they grew closer in later life, at the beginning of their marriage the Duke could not meet Georgiana&#x27;s emotional needs, and she quickly learned her role was solely to produce an heir and fulfil her social obligations. They had few interests in common, and as society dictated it was unfashionable for husband and wife to be seen too much in each other’s company, the Duke was able to resume his bachelor lifestyle by spending nights playing cards at Brooks’s. But that also allowed Georgiana to pursue her own gambling addiction.

Georgiana embraced the frenetic whirl of society and all the distractions it offered. Her position meant that she was a fashion leader, and her wit, personality and innate sense of style quickly made her a sought-after popular figure in her own right. Public speculation as to when her frenetic lifestyle would lead to collapse was satisfied when she miscarried for the second time in April of 1776. One contributing stressor was that she was deeply in debt and afraid to tell the Duke; she had hoped to be forgiven following the birth of their first child. This situation worsened as the Duke sided with popular opinion, which blamed her miscarriage on her reckless lifestyle. When her creditors threatened to apply to him, she was forced to confide in her parents. Furious, they paid her debts, but insisted that she confess to the Duke. He repaid them and then did not refer to the matter. If Lady Spencer was shaken to discover that her daughter withheld secrets from her, Georgiana was more unnerved that the matter was met by silence on the part of her husband, rather than by anger.

Before their marriage, the Duke had fathered an illegitimate daughter, Charlotte Williams, born from a dalliance with a former milliner, Charlotte Spencer (of no relation to the House of Spencer). This was unknown to the Duchess until years after her marriage to the Duke. After the death of the child&#x27;s mother, the Duke chose to take responsibility for her, and the Duchess was asked to raise Charlotte herself. Georgiana was &quot;very pleased&quot; with Charlotte, although her own mother Lady Spencer expressed disapproval: &quot;I hope you have not talk&#x27;d of her to people&quot;. The besotted Georgiana replied, &quot;She is the best humoured little thing you ever saw&quot;.

At end of 1777, Georgiana met Mrs Mary Graham. They were introduced while Georgiana was in Brighton to improve her fertility, while Mary was there for her fragile health. Lady Clermont reported to Lady Spencer about Georgiana&#x27;s instant closeness to Mary, describing her as &quot;a very pretty sort of girl. I wish she had half a dozen more such favorites&quot;. They would correspond passionately; Georgiana had finally found someone genuine to whom she could vent without judgement or remorse. But, in 1781, the doctor ordered Mary to be taken to a warmer climate for her weak lungs. Georgiana was devastated and tried to seek her replacement, with no avail.

In 1782, while on a retreat from London with the Duke, Georgiana met Lady Elizabeth Foster (widely known as &quot;Bess&quot;) in the City of Bath. She became close friends with Bess, who had become destitute after separating from her husband and two sons. Given the bond that developed between the two women (and the difficult position her new friend was in), with the Duke&#x27;s acquiescence Georgiana agreed to have Lady Elizabeth live with them. When the Duke began a sexual relationship with Lady Elizabeth, a ménage à trois was established, and it was arranged that Lady Elizabeth live with them permanently. While it was common for male members of the upper class to have mistresses, and female aristocrats to have lovers, it was not common or generally acceptable for a mistress to live so openly with a married couple. Furthermore, Georgiana had been desperately lonely since her marriage to the Duke, and finally having found what she believed to be the ideal friend, she became emotionally close to Lady Elizabeth. Whatever she really thought about it, the Duchess certainly became complicit in her best friend&#x27;s affair with her husband. In one of her letters, Georgiana wrote to Bess, &quot;My dear Bess, Do you hear the voice of my heart crying to you? Do you feel what it is for me to be separated from you?&quot; It seems Bess too had a deep emotional connection with Georgiana: at her death years later, a locket of Georgiana&#x27;s hair was found around Elizabeth&#x27;s neck, as well as a bracelet also containing hair of Georgiana on a table beside her deathbed. In modern times it&#x27;s been suggested that Lady Elizabeth insinuated her way into the marriage by taking advantage of the Duchess&#x27;s friendship and codependency on her, and &quot;engineered her way&quot; into a sexual relationship with the Duke. It&#x27;s true that Lady Elizabeth also engaged in well-documented sexual relations with other men while she was in the &quot;love triangle&quot; with the Duke and Duchess. Among their contemporaries, the relationship between the Duchess of Devonshire and Lady Elizabeth Foster was the subject of speculation, which has continued beyond their time. The love triangle itself was a notorious topic; it was an irregular arrangement in a high-profile marriage. Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s affair with the Duke resulted in two illegitimate children: a daughter, Caroline Rosalie St Jules, and a son, Augustus Clifford.
Despite her detached and philandering husband and volatile marriage, social norms dictated that Georgiana must produce an heir for an extra-marital sexual liaison on her part to be socially acceptable. The first successful pregnancy resulted in the birth of Lady Georgiana Dorothy Cavendish on 12 July 1783. Called &quot;Little G,&quot; she would become the Countess of Carlisle and have her own issue. Georgiana developed a strong mothering sentiment raising Charlotte, and she insisted on nursing her own children (contrary to the aristocratic custom of having a wet nurse). On 29 August 1785, a second successful pregnancy resulted in another daughter: Lady Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish, called &quot;Harryo,&quot; who would become Countess Granville and have children of her own. Finally, on 21 May 1790, the Duchess gave birth to a male heir to the dukedom: William George Spencer Cavendish, who took the title of Marquess of Hartington at birth, and was called &quot;Hart.&quot; He would never marry and would become known as &quot;the bachelor duke.&quot; With the birth of the Marquess of Hartington, Georgiana was able to take a lover.

While there is no evidence of when Georgiana began her affair with Charles Grey (later Earl Grey), she did become pregnant by him in 1791. Sent off to France, Georgiana believed she would die in childbirth. Despondent, she wrote a letter to her recently born son stating, &quot;As soon as you are old enough to understand this letter, it will be given to you. It contains the only present I can make you—my blessing, written in my blood... Alas, I am gone before you could know me, but I lov&#x27;d you, I nurs&#x27;d you nine months at my breast. I love you dearly.&quot; On 20 February 1792, Eliza Courtney was born without complications. Georgiana&#x27;s heart was broken yet again when she was forced to give away her illegitimate daughter Eliza to Grey&#x27;s family. Georgiana would later pay many visits to her daughter, providing her with presents and affection, and Eliza would grow up to marry Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Ellice and bear a daughter named Georgiana.

While in exile in France in the early 1790s, Georgiana suffered from isolation and sorely felt the separation from her children. To her eldest, she wrote, &quot;Your letter dated the 1st of Nov was delightful to me tho&#x27; it made me very melancholy my Dearest Child. This year has been the most painful of my life. . . when I do return to you, never leave you I hope again—it will be too great a happiness for me Dear Georgiana &amp; it will have been purchased by many days of regret – indeed ev&#x27;ry hour I pass away from you, I regret you; if I amuse myself or see anything I admire I long to share the happiness with you – if on the contrary, I am out of spirits I wish for your presence which alone would do me good&quot;. In order to return to England and her children, she conceded to her husband&#x27;s demands and renounced her love for Charles Grey. Family records of her exile in France were subsequently erased. However, during that period, the children of the Duke and Duchess had at one point been informed of the reason for her absence.

While the Duchess of Devonshire coped with the marital arrangements on the surface throughout her marriage, possibly as a result she suffered emotional challenges, although she clearly had an addictive nature which dated from before her marriage. She sought personal consolation from a &quot;dissipated existence&quot; in passions (socialising, fashion, politics, writing), addictions (gambling, drinking, and drugs), and affairs (with several men, not just Grey, possibly including the bachelor John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset).

==Character==
Georgiana was charismatic, generous, good-humored, and intelligent. Kindhearted, Georgiana instinctively wanted to help others and from a young age, happily gave her money to poor children or to her desperate friends. Lady Charlotte Bury wrote of Georgiana&#x27;s generosity: &quot;when some individual came to her in pecuniary distress, she would always relieve him or her, and leave her own difficulties unprovided for. Oftentimes she was wrong in doing so. ... One must be just before one is generous. But it is impossible not to be charmed by the kindly impulse which made her, without a moment&#x27;s hesitating, shield another from distress.&quot; Georgiana&#x27;s empathy extended towards animals as well. After noticing a starving cow in a field, Georgiana deduced its owner could not afford to feed it; she had the man found and gave him some money.

Despite being extremely self-conscious and making strenuous efforts to appear perfect, Georgiana &quot;always appeared natural, even when she was called upon to open a ball in front of 800 people. She could engage in friendly chatter with several people simultaneously&quot; and still make each person feel special. Widely described as almost impossible to dislike, Georgiana captured the hearts of almost everyone she met. The artist Mrs. Delaney, Mary Delany, echoed many who recorded their experiences meeting Georgiana: &quot;[She was] so agreeable, so obliging in her manner, that I am &quot;quite&quot; in love with her. I can&#x27;t tell you the civil things she said, and really they deserve a better name, which is &quot;kindness&quot; embellished by &quot;politeness&quot;. I hope she will &quot;illumine&quot; and &quot;reform&quot; her contemporaries!&quot; Even the prudish Frances Burney was begrudgingly won over by Georgiana&#x27;s unassuming grace. Georgiana was not a snob, and lacked the condescending airs of the aristocracy; she made people of all classes feel valued and at ease in her company. An example of her lack of airs was shown when Georgiana pointedly danced with French actor Monsieur Tessier after the Duchess of Manchester snobbishly refused to speak to him because he earned a living.

From childhood, Georgiana showed a characteristic need to please others, and a need for attention. Her mother Georgiana Spencer, Countess Spencer had an interest in education for girls and had discussed being patron of the educational academy that the Bluestocking poet Anna Laetitia Barbauld was to establish. Georgiana&#x27;s mother raised her daughter to behave as if she were a courtier, always on show. This strict education and training had a counter-effect, only augmenting Georgiana&#x27;s people-pleasing tendencies. Lady Spencer knew she was partly responsible for her daughter&#x27;s faults, and worried for her daughter&#x27;s future. Her natural temperament, combined with her breeding, made Georgiana into an excitable, impressionable young woman vulnerable to peer pressure. Indeed, Georgiana did the opposite of what Mary Delany hoped, and was instead corrupted by her contemporaries. Her inability to say no to her degenerate friends in the &quot;ton&quot; led Georgiana into many scrapes against her better judgement and made her feel shame over her behaviour.

Despite her efforts, Georgiana couldn&#x27;t overcome her contradictions. She was a popular leader of society who was widely beloved and yet she was so insecure and became dependent upon the dubious devotion of Lady Elizabeth Foster. She was a loyal friend, but nevertheless manipulated and never repaid trusted friends for money to pay her gambling debts. Georgiana sympathized with the plight of the poor yet couldn&#x27;t stop her own extravagant and ruinous gambling addiction.

== Pursuits and fame ==
With her renowned style, exuberant lifestyle, generosity, and marriage to the powerful Duke of Devonshire, the Duchess of Devonshire was a leading society figure. She was a high emblem of the era. Georgiana was arguably the Diana, Princess of Wales of her time; her popularity with the press and public can be compared to what her descendant experienced more than two hundred years later. Like Diana, every move Georgiana made was watched by those around her and then reported on by the press. On a personal note, Georgiana and Diana had much in common: maternal abandonment issues as a child, a famously unhappy marriage, a binge-eating disorder, the common touch, a desire to be the centre of attention, and a mutual love for their children.

Like her dear friend Marie Antoinette, the Duchess of Devonshire was one of the fashion icons of her time, and her elegantly flashy style made her the leader of fashion in England. Every outfit Georgiana wore, including her hairstyle, was immediately copied by the masses. The fashionable styling of her hair alone reached literally extraordinary heights above her exuberant outfits. In 1774, Lord Stormont presented her with an ostrich feather that was four feet long from Paris. Overnight, it became a huge hit.

Using her influence as a leading socialite and fashion icon, the Duchess of Devonshire contributed to politics, science, and literature. As part of her illustrious social engagements, the Duchess would gather around her a large salon of literary and political figures. Among her major acquaintances were the most influential figures of her time, including the Prince of Wales (later King George IV); Marie Antoinette of France; and her favourite in court, the Duchess of Polignac; Charles Grey (later Earl Grey and British Prime Minister); and Lady Melbourne (lover of the Prince of Wales). Newspapers chronicled her every appearance and activity.

She was called a &quot;phenomenon&quot; by Horace Walpole who proclaimed, &quot;[she] effaces all without being a beauty; but her youthful figure, flowing good nature, sense and lively modesty, and modest familiarity make her a phenomenon.&quot; Madame d&#x27;Arblay, who had a preference for acquaintances of talent, found that her appeal was not generally for her beauty but for far more, which included her fine &quot;manner, politeness, and gentle quiet.&quot; Sir Nathaniel Wraxall stated that her success as an individual lay &quot;in the amenity and graces of her deportment, in her irresistible manners, and the seduction of her society.&quot;

Famously, when the Duchess was stepping out of her carriage one day, an Irish dustman exclaimed: &quot;Love and bless you, my lady, let me light my pipe in your eyes!&quot; Thereafter, whenever others would compliment her, the Duchess would retort, &quot;After the dustman&#x27;s compliment, all others are insipid.&quot;

===Politics===

The Spencer family, from which the Duchess derived, was an ardent supporter of the Whig party as were she and the Cavendish family. However, because the Duke&#x27;s high position in the peerage disallowed him from participating so commonly in politics, Georgiana took it as a positive outlet for herself. In an age when the realisation of women&#x27;s rights and suffrage were still more than a century away, Georgiana became a political activist; she was the first woman to make active and influential front line appearances on the political scene. Having begun her involvement in politics in 1778 (when she inspired a mass of women to promote the Whig party), she relished enlightenment and Whig party ideals and took it upon herself to campaign—particularly for a distant cousin, Charles James Fox, who was chief party leader alongside Richard Brinsley Sheridan—for Whig policies that were anti-monarchy, advocating for liberty against tyranny.

At the time of her involvement, King George III (who detested the Whigs) and his ministers had a direct influence over the House of Commons, principally through their power of patronage. The Prince of Wales, who always relished going against the grain with his father, joined the Whig party when his friend the Duchess became involved. She was renowned for hosting dinners that became political meetings, and she took joy in cultivating the company of brilliant radicals.
During the general election of 1784, Georgiana became a major subject of scrutiny. Fanciful rumours and political cartoons circulated during the campaign, ridiculing her for securing votes in exchange for sexual and monetary rewards. Thomas Rowlandson even satirised her with a rumour of her trading kisses in his print &quot;THE DEVONSHIRE, or Most Approved Method of Securing Votes&quot;. Her mother pleaded with her to step down. Still, Georgiana was not daunted and was adamant in her activism. On election day, the Duchess of Devonshire walked the streets of London, gaining blisters on her feet, meeting face-to-face with commoners as equals. She was instrumental in the success of Fox and Lord Hood. After the extensive campaigning and negative media onslaught against her, after the win, she retired from the political arena for a while. In 1788, she returned to political activism, albeit, behind the scenes.

Even in the last years of her life, she pushed ahead in the field and attempted to help rebuild the Whig party, which had become fragmented; her efforts were to no avail, and the political party would eventually come to dissolve decades after her death.

===Literature===

Associating with the Blue Stockings Society enabled Georgiana to develop close friendships with female novelists and intellectuals; she herself was an avid writer, composing several works, of both prose and poetry, of which some were published. She composed poetry to her father as a young girl, and some of it later circulated in manuscript. It was read by Walpole (who said it was &quot;easy and prettily expressed, though it does not express much&quot;) and by Reverend William Mason, who was more favorable with higher opinions. In 1776, aged nineteen, she composed a poem, To Myself, which addressed the public perception of her.

The first of her published literary works was &quot;Emma; Or, The Unfortunate Attachment: A Sentimental Novel&quot; in 1773.

In 1778, Georgiana released the epistolary novel &quot;The Sylph&quot;. Published anonymously, it had autobiographical elements, centering on a fictional aristocratic bride who had been corrupted, and as &quot;a novel-cum-exposé of [the duchess&#x27;s] aristocratic cohorts, depicted as libertines, blackmailers, and alcoholics.&quot; It has since been speculated that &quot;The Sylph&quot; may have been written by Sophia Briscoe; a receipt at the British Library suggests that Briscoe was paid for the published work. However, it is thought more likely that Briscoe may have served as an intermediary between the Duchess of Devonshire and her publisher so that the duchess could keep her anonymity. Georgiana is said to have at least privately admitted to her authorship. &quot;The Sylph&quot; was a success and underwent four reprintings.

&quot;Memorandums of the Face of the Country in Switzerland&quot; (1799) is often wrongly attributed to Georgiana. It was in fact written by Rowley Lascelles, based on a Swiss tour in 1794.

One more piece was published in the last years of Georgiana&#x27;s life, &quot;The Passage of the Mountain of Saint Gothard&quot;, first in an unauthorised version in the &#x27;Morning Chronicle&#x27; and &#x27;Morning Post&#x27; of 20 and 21 December 1799, then in a privately printed edition in 1800. A poem dedicated to her children, &quot;The Passage of the Mountain of Saint Gothard&quot; was based on her passage of the Saint Gotthard Pass, with Bess, between 10 and 15 August 1793 on returning to England. The thirty-stanza poem, together with 28 extended notes, was translated into some of the main languages of Western Europe including into French, by Jacques Delille, in 1802; Italian, by Gaetano Polidori, in 1803; and German in 1805. &quot;The Passage of the Mountain of Saint Gothard&quot; was then reprinted in 1816, after Georgiana&#x27;s death. Samuel Taylor Coleridge published a glowing response to the poem, &#x27;Ode to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire&#x27; in the &#x27;Morning Post&#x27; on 24 December 1799.

The 5th Duchess of Devonshire was connected to some of the greatest men of letters of her time, and Samuel Johnson, a famed writer of the era, had even paid a visit to the Duke and Duchess, in 1784, at their Chatsworth home.

=== Music ===
Georgiana was among a few women whose work exemplified English theatre and popular songs of the late-eighteenth century, along with Harriet Abrams, Dorothea Bland, and Mary Ann Wrighten Pownall. Her work includes the vocal composition &quot;I Have a Silent Sorrow Here (The favorite song ... in, The Stranger)&quot; which was adapted by Mr. Shaw and R.B. Sheridan.

=== Science ===
The Duchess had a small laboratory where she conducted chemistry experiments and studied geology, natural history; she was most passionate for mineralogy. In addition to her scientific curiosity, Georgiana wanted to contribute to her children&#x27;s education.

Her interest in science arose in part because she was related through marriage to the pneumatic chemist Henry Cavendish whose lab she visited in Clapham. The Duchess frequently engaged in scientific dialogue with prominent scientists of the era including Sir Charles Blagden, Professor Henri Struve, Horace Bénédict de Saussure, Sir Joseph Banks, Sir William Hamilton, Professor Gian Vincenzo Petrini, White Watson, Bryan Higgins, and Benjamin Thompson. Her knowledge of chemistry and mineralogy was regarded as genius; Thomas Beddoes wrote to Erasmus Darwin noting that Georgiana, &quot;manifested a knowledge of modern chemistry superior to that he should have supposed any duchess or lady in England was possessed of&quot;. Petrini, Blagden, and Henry Cavendish likewise contacted her mother Countess Spencer remarking upon the Duchess&#x27;s aptitude, the degree of knowledge she acquired, and her extraordinary observations in the field of mineralogy. In pursuit of her interest, she hiked to the summit of Mount Vesuvius to observe and study the active crater and later began the Devonshire Mineral Collection at Chatsworth (the main seat of the dukes of Devonshire).

The Duchess played a key role, with Thomas Beddoes, in formulating the idea of establishing the Pneumatic Institution in Bristol. Her efforts to establish the Pneumatic Institute, which advanced the study of factitious airs, is an important event that provided a framework for modern anesthesia as well as modern biomedical research in gasotransmitters.

===Gambling===
As was common among the aristocracy of her time, Georgiana routinely gambled for leisure and amusement. However, her gaming spiraled into a ruinous addiction made worse by her emotional instability.

In the first years of her marriage, she accumulated debts surpassing the incredibly generous £4,000 that the Duke provided her annually as pin money. Her own mother disapproved and admonished her, unsuccessfully, to break her habit. After she had first incurred over £3,000 in debt, Georgiana implored her parents to give her a loan as she absolutely would not inform her husband of her debts. Her parents acquiesced and told her to inform the Duke; he nevertheless found out beforehand and repaid them.

In 1784, her gambling debt was £100,000 or the equivalent to £13 million today. Georgiana&#x27;s debt was so astronomical that it became a regular topic, to which she loathed, writing: &quot;I am cross, miserable and unhappy. I hate myself. I find my debts much talked of.&quot; Her husband almost left her due to her enormous debts.

For the rest of her life, Georgiana continued to amass an immense, ever-escalating debt that she always lied and tried to keep hidden from her husband (even though he was among the richest men in the land). While she would admit to some amount, it was always less than the total; she could not keep up with even her stated amount, and when her husband gave her money to repay, she instead would gamble that money and get herself further into debt. In confidence, she would ask for loans from the Prince of Wales. At one point, to try to settle some of her debts, she did not shrink from pressing her close friends like Mrs Mary Graham, who gave as much as she could until her husband found out, then the affluent banker Thomas Coutts for more funds.&quot;a very, very large debt. I never had courage to own it, and try&#x27;d to win it at play, by which means it became immense and was grown (I have not the courage to write the sum, but will tell you when I see you)...What had I to offer for the kind of ruin I brought on him (for every year of my life I have cost him immense sums) - a mind he could not trust in, a person faded, and 26 years of folly and indiscretion. And how do you think he has received the avowal - with the utmost generosity, goodness and kindness. His whole care has been that I may not vex myself, and you would think he was the offender not me.&quot; -Georgiana to Bess

==Later life and death==
Her absence from English society and exile in France had isolated Georgiana and was a low point for her in every respect; she returned to England, a &quot;changed woman&quot;. The Duke began suffering from gout, and she spent her time at his side nursing him. Along with a recent miscarriage, this circumstance with her husband brought about a softening and closeness between the two. She took a positive interest in science, took up writing again (producing two more works), and even continued her political activism while trying to rebuild the Whig party (to no avail before its end). Georgiana also came to meet and become friends with the wife of her former lover, Charles Grey.

In 1796, Georgiana succumbed to illness in one eye; the medical treatment resulted in a scarring of her face. However, &quot;Those scars released her from her fears. All the inhibitions about whether she was beautiful enough or whether she was up to the job left her&quot;. In her late thirties, Georgiana was able to regain pre-eminence and enjoyment in open society, although her personal life would continue to be marred by degrees of unhappiness, debt, and decline in health.

During her early forties, the Duchess of Devonshire devoted her time to the coming out of her eldest daughter, Lady Georgiana Dorothy Cavendish. The debutante was presented in 1800, and the Duchess saw her daughter wed Lord Morpeth, the heir apparent of the Earl of Carlisle, in 1801; it was the only time the Duchess of Devonshire saw one of her issue marry.

Georgiana&#x27;s health continued to decline well into her forties, and her gambling addiction continued. She once reached out to her mother, begging for a sum of 100 pounds and complaining to her of jaundice. While her mother at first believed her daughter was just ill from her gambling, Countess Spencer, as well as those around Georgiana, soon came to realise she was truly sick. She was thought to be suffering from a liver abscess.

Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, died on 30 March 1806, at 3:30, at the age of 48. She was surrounded by her husband, the 5th Duke of Devonshire; her mother, Countess Spencer; her sister, the Countess of Bessborough; her eldest daughter, Lady Morpeth (who was eight months pregnant); and Lady Elizabeth Foster. They were all said to have been inconsolable over her death. For the first time, the Duke showed moving emotion towards his late wife; a contemporary wrote, &quot;The Duke has been most deeply affected and has shown more feeling than anyone thought possible—indeed every individual in the family are in a dreadful state of affliction.&quot; Georgiana&#x27;s eldest daughter furthermore poured out her feelings, &quot;Oh my beloved, my adored departed mother, are you indeed forever parted from me—Shall I see no more that angelic countenance or that blessed voice—You whom I loved with such tenderness, you who were the . . . best of mothers, Adieu—I wanted to strew violets over her dying bed as she strewed sweets over my life, but they would not let me.&quot; Her distant cousin, Charles James Fox, for whom she had triumphantly campaigned, was noted to have shed tears. The Prince of Wales himself lamented, &quot;The best natured and the best-bred woman in England is gone.&quot; Thousands of the people of London congregated at Piccadilly, where the Cavendish family&#x27;s town house was located, to mourn her. She was buried at the family vault at All Saints Parish Church (now Derby Cathedral) in Derby.

==Legacy==

The legacy of the life of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire has remained a topic of study and intrigue in cultural and historical spheres centuries after her death.

Immediately after her death, the Duke of Devonshire discovered the extent of her debts. He soon enough married Lady Elizabeth Foster, who became Duchess of Devonshire as his second wife.

Georgiana&#x27;s children were discontented with the marriage as they never liked Lady Elizabeth at all (something that caused dismay with their mother when she was alive). When William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, died on 29 July 1811, the Marquess of Hartington became 6th Duke of Devonshire. He sought to liquidate his late mother&#x27;s entire debts. Meanwhile, Lady Elizabeth fought to keep the Cavendish properties to which she wasn&#x27;t entitled; the 6th Duke denied her demand that her illegitimate son, Clifford, bear the Cavendish crest along with the 5th Duke of Devonshire. Infuriated, Lady Elizabeth brought up her affair with the 5th Duke of Devonshire by publicly announcing that he had sired her illegitimate children. The 6th Duke of Devonshire finally made an end to it all by paying off Lady Elizabeth and getting rid of her. Nevertheless, Georgiana&#x27;s children had mutually positive relations with Lady Elizabeth Foster&#x27;s children for the rest of their lives, having grown up together.

In 1786, Susanna Rowson, who went on to become a bestselling author, dedicated her first published work, &quot;Victoria&quot;, to the Duchess of Devonshire.

With the topic of liberation at the heart of her policies, the bold involvement of the Duchess of Devonshire in political activism pioneered women&#x27;s involvement in public, championing their influential participation long before the validation of women&#x27;s rights and subsequent feminist ideals.

Artwork representing the Duchess of Devonshire by reputable painters of the Georgian era remain, including a 1787 portrait by the famed Thomas Gainsborough which was once thought lost.

Over 1,000 personal letters written by the Duchess of Devonshire remain in existence. Chatsworth, the duke of Devonshire&#x27;s seat, houses a majority of her letters in historical archives.

In modern times, her life&#x27;s circumstances are seen as an example of female oppression by historical, cultural and legal constructs favoring male interests while denying rights to the female party in a relationship. They have become the subject of scholarly and dramatised works.

===In literature===

Thomas Skinner Surr&#x27;s novel &quot;A Winter in London&quot; satirised the Duchess as the Duchess of Belgrave, who is several times defrauded, including being tricked into a bribing someone to stop publishing a libellous memoir, and having a friend&#x27;s jewels stolen by a maid when she tries to pawn them. The Duchess was &quot;dreadfully hurt&quot; by this portrayal, and Elizabeth Wynne Fremantle wrote in her diary that the Duke said it had given her a &quot;death blow&quot;; Samuel Rogers and Sydney Owenson also suggested that the novel hastened her death.

==Economy==
As of late 2005, much of the new residential development in Hamilton has been geared to accommodating the aging baby boomer generation. New retirement communities and assisted-living facilities outpace that of new traditional residential communities. Such construction has been spurred by several factors. The first being that the public is skeptical of growing school budgets due to its already large size. Hamilton voters have often rejected increases in school budgets in their yearly elections to keep already high taxes from growing higher. As a result, the planning board has been reluctant to authorize construction of housing that will increase the student population. Another reason is a series of improvements to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, Hamilton. The hospital is now a highly respected source of care in the state. It is situated next to where most of the under-developed land in the township used to be, land that is now home to the active older-adult communities.

As of October 2016, significant construction has been done to further build up the Hamilton Township area. Multiple new retirement communities have been constructed, as well as multiple new restaurants, banks, gas stations and convenience stores along Route 33. Hamilton Township continues to expand rapidly to accommodate the increase in citizens residing in the community.

==Parks and recreation==

Hamilton hosts one of the largest recreational parks in the state, and borders another. The municipal Veterans Park is and is housed entirely in the township. Mercer County Park borders the township to the North and encompasses of land that was shared from Hamilton Township along with neighboring Lawrence Township and West Windsor Township.

The Grounds for Sculpture is a sculpture park which houses more than 270 sculptures, gardens, water features, and other nature scenes. The organization&#x27;s mission is to promote the appreciation of arts and sculpture.

Sayen Park Botanical Garden is named after Fredrick Sayen because it was originally his land and his home.

<text>Hightstown is a borough in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Nestled within the Raritan Valley region, Hightstown is an historic, commercial, and cultural hub of Central New Jersey, along with being a diverse outer-ring commuter suburb of New York City in the New York Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 5,900, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 406 (+7.4%) from the 5,494 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 278 (+5.3%) from the 5,216 counted in the 2000 census.

Hightstown was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 5, 1853, within portions of East Windsor Township. The borough became fully independent around 1894. Additional portions of East Windsor Township were annexed in 1913, 1915, and 1927. The traditional explanation is that the borough was named for John and Mary Hight, who established a tavern in the area in the 1750s.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.27 square miles (3.28 km2), including 1.23 square miles (3.19 km2) of land and 0.03 square miles (0.09 km2) of water (2.60%).

The borough is an independent municipality surrounded entirely by East Windsor, making it part one of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.

Hightstown is at the central-most point of New Jersey and is roughly equidistant from Philadelphia and New York City.

<text>Hopewell is a borough in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Centrally located within the Raritan Valley region, this historical settlement (and its neighboring township of the same name) is an exurban commuter suburb of New York City in the New York metropolitan area as defined by the United States Census Bureau. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,918, a decrease of 4 (−0.2%) from the 2010 census count of 1,922, which in turn had reflected a decline of 113 (−5.6%) from the 2,035 counted at the 2000 census.

Hopewell was incorporated as by the New Jersey Legislature on April 14, 1891, from portions of Hopewell Township, based on the results of a referendum held on March 21, 1891. Additional portions of Hopewell Township were annexed in 1915 and the borough was reincorporated in 1924.

==History==
===Colonial era===
The Lenape tribe of Native Americans were the original inhabitants of the area that would later become Hopewell. The first Colonial influence in Hopewell by European settlers was the purchase of a tract of land by Daniel Coxe a Royal British governor of West Jersey, in the latter half of the 17th century. All land in Hopewell can be traced back to this purchase. In 1691 Coxe, transferred his land to a company called The West Jersey Society of England, who intended to sell the land. The society appointed an agent, Thomas Revell, to preside over the land and sell it to prospective buyers. Revell then attracted settlers from New England, Long Island, and New Jersey falsely claiming that the land was fertile, and tame. However, the families that arrived in Hopewell only found vast stretches of wilderness. The first settler in Hopewell Valley was Thomas Tindall who on November 10, 1699, bought a tract of land from The West Jersey Society of England through Revell, for &quot;ten pounds per hundred acres&quot;. Other early settlers in Hopewell are said to be the Stouts, who immigrated from Holmdel to Hopewell in 1706, including Jonathan Stout, who had hunted in the area together with the Lenape. Perhaps the first conflict between colonists in Hopewell was the dispute between Revell and the early inhabitants of Hopewell, who realized that their deeds were worthless due to Revell&#x27;s false claims. Fifty settlers then organized a class action lawsuit against Revell and the West Jersey Society. A lengthy trial was held in Burlington and the court ultimately ruled against the settlers, who were forced to repurchase their land or relocate. Many settlers weren&#x27;t able to repay and moved north into North Jersey and New York.

On April 23, 1715, the settlers who stayed in Hopewell, most notably the Stout family, organized the Old School Baptist Church, and what is now known as Hopewell was then referred to as &quot;Baptist Meetinghouse&quot;. One of the most valued members of the meeting house was Declaration of Independence signer John Hart who in 1740 purchased of land in the north of current day Hopewell, and in 1747 as a sign of Hart&#x27;s devotion to the Church, donated a plot of his land to the Baptists. The next year the Baptists made good use of this land and in 1748 erected their Old School Baptist Church meeting house on West Broad Street. The meeting house brought in Baptists from miles around to Hopewell and encouraged Hopewell&#x27;s early growth.

Numerous lumber mills were established in and around Hopewell at this time to process the lumber that was generated from the clearing of forests for farms.

In 1756, Isaac Eaton the first pastor of the Old School Baptist Church established the Hopewell Academy. One of his students, James Manning, would go on to establish Brown University in 1765.

===Frog war===
The first railroad to reach Hopewell was the Mercer and Somerset Railway, which was backed by the Pennsylvania Railroad. It was created largely to protect the monopoly the Pennsylvania Railroad had on New Jersey, by cutting off the first separately owned railroad in New Jersey, the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad, by being built in the way of it. It was completed in 1874. The Delaware and Bound Brook reached Hopewell in 1876, but the railroad had to cross the Mercer and Somerset&#x27;s track just to the northwest of Hopewell. A dispute occurred at the crossing, known as a frog, and escalated into each company parking locomotives over the crossing to prevent the other company from moving trains over it. Eventually, militia had to be called in to keep the peace, and the Delaware and Bound Brook prevailed. Soon after the Frog War the Mercer and Somerset was liquidated having failed at its purpose. Some of the abandoned right of way for the Mercer and Somerset in Hopewell became Model Avenue. The Delaware and Bound Brook was leased by the Philadelphia and Reading in 1879 for 999 years and has become the CSX Trenton Line and is still in use today. The Frog is also what gives Hopewell Elementary school its mascot, &quot;Freddy the Frog&quot; in honor of the Hopewell frog war.
=== The Hopewell Herald ===
The main source of news for Hopewell Township prior to the 1960s was the &quot;Hopewell Herald&quot;, which was owned, operated, and published by the Savidge family of Hopewell.

<text>Hopewell Township is a township in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located at the cross-roads between the Delaware Valley region to the southwest and the Raritan Valley region to the northeast, the township considered an exurb of New York City in the New York metropolitan area as defined by the United States Census Bureau, while also directly bordering the Philadelphia metropolitan area, being a part of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Philadelphia Designated Market Area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 17,491, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 187 (+1.1%) from the 2010 census count of 17,304, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,199 (+7.4%) from the 16,105 counted in the 2000 census.

The township dates back to February 20, 1700, when the area was still part of Burlington County. One of the earliest European settlers before 1710 was George Woolsey, formerly of Jamaica, Queens (in present-day New York City), whose father was one of the earliest pre-1650 settlers of what was New Amsterdam. His descendants maintained the family farm for over 200 years.

The township was formerly the name for one of two portions of of land purchased in 1714 by William Trent, and was formally set off to Hunterdon County, when that county was created on March 11, 1714. Trenton Township was formed out of this estate on June 3, 1719, later to become the City of Trenton. Hopewell Township was incorporated by Royal charter on March 1, 1755, and was re-incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as one of the state&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships. Hopewell Township became part of Mercer County at its creation on February 22, 1838. Portions of the township were taken to form Marion Township (February 22, 1838, reverted to Hopewell Township on February 14, 1839), the Borough of Pennington (January 31, 1890) and Hopewell Borough (April 14, 1891), with additional portions of the township transferred to both Pennington and Hopewell Borough in 1915.

Hopewell Township includes the location (now known as Washington Crossing) along the east side of the Delaware River to which George Washington and the Continental Army crossed from Pennsylvania. Once in Hopewell Township, the army marched to Trenton on December 26, 1776. The Battle of Trenton followed. Today, Washington Crossing State Park commemorates this important milestone in American history.

Hopewell Township was also the location where—two months after being abducted from his home in neighboring East Amwell—the body of Charles Lindbergh Jr. was discovered on May 12, 1932.

<text>Lawrence Township is a township in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located at the cross-roads between the Delaware Valley region to the southwest and the Raritan Valley region to the northeast, the township is an outer-ring suburb of New York City in the New York Metropolitan area, as defined by the United States Census Bureau, while also directly bordering the Philadelphia metropolitan area and is part of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Philadelphia Designated Market Area.

The home of the prestigious Lawrenceville School, Rider University, and the site of the Quaker Bridge Mall, the township is a regional commercial and cultural hub of central New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 33,077, a decrease of 395 (−1.2%) from the 2010 census count of 33,472, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,313 (+14.8%) from the 29,159 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
What is now Lawrence Township was originally formed as Maidenhead Township on February 20, 1697, while the area was still part of Burlington County in West Jersey on the eastern boundary of the Province Line (on the other side of which was East Jersey). The township was named by the early Quaker settlers after Maidenhead, a Thames River village west of London.

In 1698, Puritan settlers from Long Island and Connecticut came to Maidenhead and were granted land and established a Presbyterian church. A meetinghouse was erected on the site of the present Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceville in the early 1700s. A record from 1709 indicates that it was used both for a meeting of the Presbytery of Philadelphia and for a session of the Hunterdon County Court. The present structure was built in 1764.
The township became part of the newly created Hunterdon County on March 11, 1714. Maidenhead Township was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798.

In 1810, the seventh minister of the church, Isaac V. Brown, began the Maidenhead Academy to prepare young men for college. This school is now the Lawrenceville School.

On January 24, 1816, the municipality was renamed Lawrence Township, in honor of Captain James Lawrence—commander of the frigate , one of the naval heroes of the War of 1812, and a native of relatively nearby Burlington, New Jersey—best known for his dying command of &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship&quot;. Lawrence Township became part of Mercer County at its creation on February 22, 1838. Portions of the township were taken to form Millham Township on February 10, 1882, which was annexed six years later by Trenton.

On September 23, 2003, at approximately 8:25am, an F1 tornado ripped through Lawrence Township. The tornado followed a path along Princeton Pike and caused widespread damage to homes. There were no fatalities.

Violent crime in Lawrence Township is notably rare. A fatal shooting at an Applebee&#x27;s restaurant on November 14, 2017, was the first murder in the township in 16 years.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 21.98 square miles (56.94 km2), including 21.73 square miles (56.27 km2) of land and 0.26 square miles (0.67 km2) of water (1.17%).

Lawrenceville (with a 2010 Census population of 3,887) is a census-designated place and unincorporated community located within Lawrence Township.

==Transportation==

===Roads and highways===

, the township had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Mercer County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

Several major transportation routes traverse the Township. Interstate 295 runs through as a semicircle while U.S. Route 1, the other major highway, bisects the municipality. U.S. 1 is in effect three different roads: the original route from Trenton to New Brunswick in the southern half of the Township, the limited access Trenton Freeway, and the combined road in the northern half that serves as a regional arterial linking the Interstates with New Brunswick and Route 18.

U.S. Route 206 (Lawrence Road) is the main artery within the township itself, running from Trenton to Princeton roughly north-to-south. It is a segment of the historic Lincoln Highway, and before that, it was part of the main New York-Philadelphia Post road in the decades after the Revolutionary War. Major county routes that pass through include County Route 533, County Route 546 and County Route 569.
Lawrence Township had been the site of what was called the &quot;abrupt ending&quot; of Interstate 95. This was a result from politics in Somerset County that eliminated a planned connection of the Somerset Freeway to Interstate 287. Originally, when drivers travelled along I-95 north while approaching the interchange for U.S. Route 1, the 95 designation abruptly ended and the highway turned southward and became Interstate 295. Drivers wishing to continue north were required to use an alternate route, either by taking US 1 north, or continue along Interstate 295 south to Interstate 195 east and to the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) at Exit 7A in Robbinsville Township. This portion of interstate (between the Hopewell Township border and U.S. 1) was renumbered from I-95 to I-295 in May 2018.

===Public transportation===
The busy Northeast Corridor rail line, carrying Amtrak and NJ Transit trains, runs along the eastern edge of the township. The nearest stations are in Hamilton, Trenton, Princeton and Princeton Junction.

NJ Transit provides bus service to Trenton on the 600, 603, 605, 606, 609 and 613 routes, and local service on route 612.

A rail spur used to run to Lawrenceville from Trenton, but was discontinued in the 1970s and is now a bicycle trail. From Lawrenceville, a trolley line to Princeton existed from 1900 to 1941, but was dismantled before World War II, and the right-of-way largely has reverted to neighboring landowners.

The nearest commercial airport is Trenton-Mercer Airport, formerly known as the Mercer County Airport, in Ewing Township with nonstop service to 10 major cities in the eastern half of the United States.

<text>Pennington is a borough in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough is located at the cross-roads between the Delaware Valley region to the southwest and the Raritan Valley region to the northeast. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 2,802, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 217 (+8.4%) from the 2010 census count of 2,585, which in turn had reflected a decline of 111 (−4.1%) from the 2,696 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==

According to an 1883 history, &quot;the first name of the village was Queenstown, which was given it in honor of Queen Anne. Later it was by some, in derision of its comparative insignificance, Pennytown, and as early as 1747 it began to be called Pennington.&quot; The name &quot;Penington&quot; was already known in the area, as Edward Penington (1667–1701), son of the British Quaker leader Isaac Penington, was appointed by his kinsman William Penn as Surveyor General of Pennsylvania. His father-in-law was a longtime leader, including as governor, of the province of West Jersey, where Edward married. Henry Gannett attributes the borough&#x27;s name to colonial governors from the Pennington family.

Pennington was established as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on January 31, 1890, from portions of Hopewell Township, based on the results of a referendum held on January 21, 1890. It is a dry borough, where alcohol cannot be sold.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.96 square miles (2.50 km2), including 0.96 square miles (2.49 km2) of land and &lt;0.01 square miles (0.01 km2) of water (0.31%).

The borough is an independent municipality completely surrounded by Hopewell Township, making it part one of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.43% (37) of the population.

Of the 1,031 households, 34.9% had children under the age of 18; 60.4% were married couples living together; 6.6% had a female householder with no husband present and 30.9% were non-families.

==Government==

===Local government===

Pennington is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members, who are elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Pennington is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council. The borough council has the option to designate an administrator or assign executive responsibilities to the administrator. The council may also adopt an administrative code which describes how the Council performs its duties.

, the mayor of Pennington is Democrat James Davy, who was elected to serve an unexpired term of office ending December 31, 2023. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Catherine M. &quot;Kit&quot; Chandler (D, 2023), Katrina Angarone (D, 2025), Deborah L. Gnatt (D, 2024), Charles &quot;Chico&quot; Marciante (D, 2025), Nadine Stern (D, 2024) and John Valenza (D, 2023; appointed to serve an unexpired term).

In February 2023, the council selected John Valenza to fill the seat that had been held by Ken Gross expiring in December 2023 that became vacant when he resigned.

Katrina Angarone was selected in February 2022 from a list of three names submitted by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2022 that had been held by Beverly Mills until her resignation from office the previous month.

In June 2021, the borough council appointed former councilmember James Davy to fill the mayoral seat expiring in December 2023 that became vacant following the resignation of Joseph Lawver earlier that month. Davy served on an interim basis until the November 2021 general election, when he was elected to serve the remainder of the term of office.

In January 2019, Joseph Lawver was appointed to fill the mayoral seat expiring in December 2019 that was vacated by Anthony Persichilli, the borough&#x27;s longest-serving mayor, when he resigned from office the previous month. Former mayor Persichilli was first elected on November 7, 2006, to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of James Loper. Returned to office at that same election were Democratic council members Joseph Lawver and Eileen Heinzel. James Loper, the previous elected mayor, had resigned from office effective February 1, 2006. The Pennington Republican Committee nominated three candidates to take his place and the council selected James Benton from the three candidates to fill the vacancy. That same procedure was repeated in December 2006, when the borough council selected Diane Zompa to fill the unexpired term left by Persichilli.

<text>Princeton Township was a township in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, that existed from 1838 until the end of 2012. On January 1, 2013, it merged with the Borough of Princeton to form Princeton, New Jersey; both Princeton Township and the Borough of Princeton were dissolved in the merger.

As of the 2010 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 16,265, reflecting an increase of 238 (+1.5%) from the 16,027 counted in the 2000 census, which had in turn increased by 2,829 (+21.4%) from the 13,198 counted in the 1990 census.

Princeton was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 9, 1838, from portions of West Windsor Township in Mercer County and Montgomery Township in Somerset County. The Borough of Princeton — created on February 11, 1813 within the area that later became Princeton Township — became a fully independent municipality circa 1894. Portions of territory were ceded to the Borough of Princeton on January 4, 1928 and August 21, 1951. On November 8, 2011, voters in Princeton Township voted to consolidate with Princeton Borough, a change that took effect on January 1, 2013.

The Institute for Advanced Study, a private research institution that has been an academic home to Albert Einstein, Kurt Gödel, and many other famous and prize-winning scientists, is located in the former township. Princeton University is located mostly within the former borough, but parts of the campus extended into what was Princeton Township.

Drumthwacket, the official residence of the governor of New Jersey, is located at 344 Stockton Street in the area of the former township.

=== Local government ===
Princeton Township was governed under the Township form of government with a five-member Township Committee. The Township Committee was elected directly by the voters in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with one seat coming up for election each year. A Mayor and Deputy Member were elected by the Committee from among its members and serve a one-year term. The Mayor served as the Chairperson of the Committee and exercised executive powers vested in the Mayor&#x27;s Office by law. All legislative powers were assigned to the Committee. 104 of the 565 municipalities in New Jersey operate with a five-member Committee form of local government.

In Princeton Borough 1,385 voted for, 902 voted against while in Princeton Township 3,542 voted for and 604 voted against. Proponents of the consolidation measure asserted that when the merger is completed, the new municipality of Princeton will save $3.2 million as a result of some scaled-down services, including layoffs of 15 government workers, including 9 police officers (however, the measure itself does not create any line item cost reduction or layoffs). Opponents to the consolidation measure asserted that cost savings alleged by a widely circulated report were incorrect and/or unsubstantiated and that individual voter representation would be diluted by the merged municipal structure. The consolidation is to take effect in 2013.

<text>Princeton Junction is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within West Windsor township, Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 2,475.

== History ==

Following the mid-1860s relocation of the Camden &amp; Amboy rail line from next to the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal to the present location of the Northeast Corridor, and the subsequent construction of a train station south of the intersection of Washington Road and the new rail line, a community called &quot;Princeton Junction&quot; developed. This community originally featured several farmhouses, a hotel, a general store, a feed mill, and several other businesses centered around the intersection of Station Drive and Washington Road, profiting off of access to other cities provided by the rail line.

The construction of the neighborhood of Berrien City (focused around Scott Avenue, Alexander Road, and Berrien Avenue) starting in the 1910s represented West Windsor&#x27;s first planned development. Following the reconstruction of the Washington Road railroad bridge in 1939, the business center of the community shifted to the intersection of Washington Road and Cranbury Road, where a lumber yard, service station, liquor store, strip mall, several gas stations, and several more businesses operated for decades.

Following World War II, the Princeton Junction population grew with the construction of residential developments such as Sherbrooke Estates, Windsor Chase, and Wellington Estates.

Princeton Junction is currently the proposed site of a &quot;transit village&quot; to be built northwest of the train station.

In October 2019, the Historical Society of West Windsor published an online museum exploring the history of West Windsor - including that of Princeton Junction.

==Geography==

Princeton Junction is in eastern Mercer County, in the northern part of West Windsor Township. The northeastern boundary of the community is the Millstone River, across which is Plainsboro Township in Middlesex County. Bear Brook, a tributary of the Millstone, forms the eastern border of Princeton Junction, and the CDP extends north as far as U.S. Route 1. Trenton, the state capital, is to the southwest, the borough of Princeton is to the northwest, and New Brunswick is to the northeast. Part of the Berrien City development is in the southwest corner of the CDP.

Princeton Junction&#x27;s name comes from the train station of the same name, now on the Amtrak and New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor. The station is the junction between this main line and a spur served by the &quot;Dinky&quot; train, run by New Jersey Transit, to Princeton itself.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Princeton Junction CDP has a total area of , including of land and of water (1.72%).

==Business and industry==
The turn of the century saw the closure of Lick-It ice cream, a tiny kiosk-like yellow building that served ice cream to walk-in and drive-through customers, always including a trademark nonpareil in the ice cream. The site is now occupied by PNC Bank opened in 2006.

In 2009, Princeton Junction saw the closure of an Acme Supermarket, which had been an anchor tenant in the Windsor Plaza Shopping Center for nearly 40 years; the store closed in the face of the opening of larger and more modern supermarkets nearby.

Some residents blame the &quot;deterioration&quot; of the central Princeton Junction area on a lack of political consensus.

<text>Robbinsville Township is a township in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located on the border of the New York metropolitan area and the Philadelphia metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 15,476, its highest decennial count ever. Inspired by its central geographical location within New Jersey, Robbinsville&#x27;s motto is &quot;Be at the Center of it All&quot;.

The township was incorporated as in 1859 as Washington Township. It changed its name to Robbinsville in 2008, the name of a settlement within the township, after the politician George R. Robbins.

Robbinsville has the only team to reach the Little League Softball World Series four times in seven years. It is home to the BAPS Swaminarayan Akshardham, one of the largest Hindu temples in the world.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Allens Station, Carsons Mills, Hillside Terrace, Meadows Terrace, New Canton, New Sharon, Pages Corners, Robbinsville Center and Windsor.

==History==
What is now Robbinsville Township was originally incorporated as Washington Township (named for George Washington) by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 15, 1859, from portions of East Windsor.

On November 6, 2007, voters approved by a vote of 1,816 to 693 a measure that changed the township&#x27;s name from Washington Township (the name of five other municipalities in New Jersey) to Robbinsville, named after a settlement within the township. The official changeover took place January 1, 2008, as signs and other items with &quot;Washington&quot; on them began to be changed. It is named for George R. Robbins, who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1855 to 1859 and lived in the area.

The Mayor is the Chief Executive of the Township and heads its Administration. The Mayor may attend Council meetings but is not obliged to do so. The council is the legislative branch. Elections are held in odd-numbered years with three council seats up together and the two other seats (and the mayoral seat) up for election two years later. At the annual organizational meeting held during the first week of January of each year, the Council selects a President and Vice President to serve for one-year terms.

<text>West Windsor is a township in Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located at the cross-roads between the Delaware Valley region to the southwest and the Raritan Valley region to the northeast, the township is considered to be an outer-ring suburb of New York City in the New York metropolitan area, as defined by the United States Census Bureau. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 29,518, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 2,353 (+8.7%) from the 27,165 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 5,258 (+24.0%) from the 21,907 counted in the 2000 census.

West Windsor and adjacent East Windsor were established by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 9, 1797, and incorporated on February 21, 1798, as two of the state&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships, by partitioning provincial Windsor Township.

The Borough of Princeton, now part of Princeton, was formed from a portion of the township on February 11, 1813. The township is closely associated with the more widely known municipality and several localities within West Windsor use &quot;Princeton&quot; in their name, the most notable of those being Princeton Junction. The Princeton 08540 post office facility is located within West Windsor, and covers parts of the township designated by Princeton mailing addresses.

A portion of Princeton University, covering south of Lake Carnegie, is located in West Windsor. The university agreed in 2009 to make an annual payment in lieu of taxes of $50,000 that would be indexed to inflation to cover of land in the township that the university had purchased in 2002.

West Windsor is frequently ranked among some of the highest-income municipalities in New Jersey. In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed West Windsor as the 15th most affluent neighborhood in the U.S. Using 2012–2016 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, NJ.com listed the township as the 9th highest-income in the state in its January 2018 article &quot;The 19 wealthiest towns in New Jersey, ranked.&quot; Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, West Windsor residents had a median household income of $175,684, ranked 4th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

==History==

Prior to individual European land acquisition and settlement around the turn of the 18th century, the primary residents of West Windsor were the Lenape Native Americans. The Assanhicans (Assunpinks) were the subtribe that inhabited the greater Trenton area; artifacts from their society are still found in West Windsor.

In 1634, and English captain named Thomas Yong explored the Delaware River, up to the general Trenton area. Had his crew followed the Assunpink northeastward, their path would have taken them to the general West Windsor area. However, they did not, and the identity of the first European person to set foot in West Windsor is unknown.

The West Windsor area was within Piscataway Township when it was chartered on December 18, 1666. This changed upon the formation of Middlesex County in 1683.
New Windsor Township (West Windsor&#x27;s predecessor), known later as Windsor Township, was unofficially formed in 1730/1731, and officially created by Royal Charter on March 9, 1751, from a partition of Piscataway Township. Its borders encompassed today&#x27;s West Windsor Township, East Windsor Township, Hightstown Borough and Robbinsville Township, as well as present-day Princeton southeast of Nassau Street and portions of present-day Millstone Township and Monroe Township. In 1756, The College of New Jersey relocated to Nassau Hall in the village of Princeton. When West Windsor and East Windsor were created from the division of Windsor Township on February 9, 1797, West Windsor&#x27;s boundaries extended up to Nassau Street. Following the 1838 formation of Mercer County and further land acquisitions by Princeton in 1843 and 1853, West Windsor&#x27;s borders were again redefined to reflect the township&#x27;s current .

Historically, West Windsor relied heavily upon agriculture. Common products were wheat, tomatoes, rye, and potatoes. This farming identity dominated the township from its first settlement until the last half of the 20th century, and was really only extinguished upon the township&#x27;s most rapid period of growth from the late 1970s-the 2000s.

However, this agrarian dominance incentivized the institution of slavery as well. Although records are sparse, township censuses indicate 190 slaves in Windsor Township in 1790. In West Windsor, there were 21 slaves in 1830 and 3 in 1840. Additionally, several late 1700s wills and 1800s &quot;abandonments&quot; show the presence of slavery in the township around the turn of the 19th century.

West Windsor never developed a centralized &quot;downtown.&quot; Instead, The township contained within it (entirely or partly) several small hamlets whose names and locations are still identifiable and/or in use in contemporary times. They are as follows:

:* Aqueduct Mills – centered at Mapleton Avenue, Lower Harrison Street, and the Millstone River. Partly located in Plainsboro.
:* Canal/Princeton Basin – at the intersection of Alexander Road and the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal. Partially located in Princeton.
:*Clarksville – at the intersection of Route 1 and Quakerbridge Road.
:*Dutch Neck – at the intersection of Village Roads East/West and South Mill Road.
:*Edinburg – at the intersection of Old Trenton and Edinburg Roads.
:* Jugtown/Queenston – at the intersection of Nassau and Harrison Streets. Now fully located in Princeton.
:*Grovers Mill – at the intersection of Cranbury and Clarksville Roads.
:*Penns Neck – Centered at the intersection of Washington Road and Route 1.
:*Port Windsor/Mercer – at the end of Quakerbridge Road at the Delaware Canal. Partially located in Lawrence.
:*Princeton Junction – Initially centered at the Princeton Junction Train Station. Manifested after the mid-1860s relocation of the Camden and Amboy Railroad line (now the Northeast Corridor) and opening of the current station.

Grover&#x27;s Mill in West Windsor was the site Orson Welles chose for the Martian invasion in his infamous 1938 radio broadcast of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.

During the later part of the 20th century the township underwent dramatic changes, driven mainly by a major boom in new housing developments. For generations, West Windsor had existed mostly as a sparsely populated agricultural community according to a 1999 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the township &quot;has grown into a sprawl of expensive houses in carefully groomed developments, and home to nearly 20,000 people&quot;, since the 1970s.

The West Windsor post office was found to be infected with anthrax during the 2001 anthrax attacks.

In April 2002, a memorial was dedicated to the seven residents of West Windsor who died in the September 11 terrorist attacks.

In October 2019, the Historical Society of West Windsor published an online museum exploring the history of West Windsor.

Other unincorporated communities in the township include Berrien City, Dutch Neck, Edinburg, Grover&#x27;s Mill, Millstone, Penns Neck, Port Mercer, Post Corner, and Princeton Ivy East.

The township borders the municipalities of East Windsor, Hamilton, Lawrence Township, Princeton and Robbinsville in Mercer County; and Plainsboro in Middlesex County.

The Howard Hughes Corporation has proposed redevelopment of a tract of land bounded by the Northeast Corridor train line, Route 1, and Quakerbridge Road, which includes land once owned by American Cyanamid and last used up until 2002 as an agricultural research facility by BASF; in of 2017 a plan was proposed to create mixed-use development that would include 2,000 residences along with of retail and commercial space on the site, which is currently zoned for commercial use. The local school district has developed a report identifying significant potential growth in the number of students enrolling from this and other residential development in both West Windsor and Plainsboro. In 2019, Atlantic Realty purchased the property, and in November 2020 they and the township reached an agreement to restrict the tract to non-residential use and convert it to warehouse space. The West Windsor Planning Board granted approval to build 5.5 million square feet of warehouse space (called &quot;Bridge Point 8&quot;) on June 29, 2022.&quot;

== Government ==

=== Local government ===

West Windsor is governed under the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) within the mayor-council form of New Jersey municipal government (Plan 6), implemented based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission as of July 1, 1993. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. From the time of its formation in 1797, until 1993, the township was governed by a township committee, which combined both executive and legislative authority. In May 1993, West Windsor residents voted to change their form of government to a Faulkner Act form of government.
The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the five-member Township Council. Under the township&#x27;s mayor-council form of government, the mayor and council function as independent branches of government. The mayor is the chief executive of the township and heads its administration. The mayor is elected in a non-partisan election and serves for a four-year term. The mayor may attend council meetings but is not obligated to do so. The council is the legislative branch. The five members of the township council are elected on a non-partisan basis for four-year terms on a staggered basis, with either two seats (and the mayoral seat) or three seats up for vote in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election. At the annual organizational meeting held during the first week of January of each year, the Council elects a president and vice president to serve for one-year terms. The council president chairs the meetings of the governing body. Starting in 2011, the township&#x27;s elections were shifted from May to November as part of an effort to lower costs of running standalone municipal elections and as part of an effort to increase voter participation.

, the mayor of West Windsor is Hemant Marathe, whose term of office ends December 31, 2025; Marathe is the first Indian-American to serve as the township&#x27;s mayor.

<text>White Horse is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, in the United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 9,791.

==History==
The community&#x27;s name derives from a local tradition that holds that George Washington rode through the area on a white horse in 1789 on his journey from Virginia to New York City for his first presidential inauguration.

==Geography==
White Horse is in southern Mercer County, with part of its southern border following Crosswicks Creek, the border with Burlington County to the south. Interstate 195 forms the remainder of the southern border of the community. Interstate 295 passes through the western part of the community. White Horse is bordered to the southeast by Yardville, and downtown Trenton is to the northwest. U.S. Route 206 passes through the center of White Horse, following Broad Street to the northwest toward Trenton. In the other direct, US 206 leads south to Bordentown.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the White Horse CDP has a total area of , including of land and of water (1.80%).

===White Horse Circle===
White Horse Circle is a traffic circle locally known by name, in the southwest part of White Horse. Up until 2018 it was not a true traffic circle, because it was bisected by northbound U.S. Route 206, which made a left turn in the circle. This intersection connects South Broad Street (US 206 north and Route 524 east), White Horse-Mercerville Road (Route 533 north) and Bordentown Road (US 206 south). Only Route 533 had a stop sign at the circle, while Route 524 and the southern part of Route 206 have traffic signals some distance from the circle. To allow cars to move in a safe fashion, there were six yield-signed road segments allowing cars to get to Route 206 and from the highway to Route 533. Route 206, when the light allowed, had no yield sign restrictions. Since the completion of Interstate 195 and Interstate 295, which intersect southwest of the circle, much of the traffic that would have passed through the circle is able to use the wider, faster freeways, reducing the traffic load at the circle. Hamilton Township approved a construction project under which the modifications at the circle were completed by 2018, at a site that the township&#x27;s engineer described as having an average of one accident a week. The new circle operates as a roundabout with two concentric lanes and many arrows to help drivers navigate the circle. The biggest change was the new requirement to yield to traffic in the circle, rather than yielding to traffic on the major roads. Accidents have decreased since this new roundabout was finished.

In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 37 was legislated to run from Route 27 and Route 30 (now U.S. Route 1 Business, U.S. Route 206, and Route 31) in Trenton continuing through the White Horse Circle and on to Seaside Heights. The western end of Route 37 was once planned to be at White Horse Circle, though that section of the planned route was eventually built as Interstate 195, with other portions returned to the counties as part of Route 524.

A tall statue of a white horse was constructed on the circle in 2010, commemorating the local tradition that George Washington rode through the area on a white horse while traveling to New York City in 1789.

<text>Hatuey (), also Hatüey (; died 2 February 1512), was a Taíno &quot;Cacique&quot; (chief) of the Hispaniolan cacicazgo of Guanaba (in present-day La Gonave, Haiti). He lived from the late 15th until the early 16th century. Chief Hatuey and many of his tribesmen travelled from present-day La Gonave by canoe to Cuba to warn the Taíno in Cuba about the Spaniards that were arriving to conquer the island.

He later attained legendary status for leading a group of natives in a fight against the invasion of the Spaniards, thus becoming one of the first fighters against Spanish colonialism in the New World. He is celebrated as &quot;Cuba&#x27;s first national hero.&quot;

==Life and death==
In 1511, Diego Velázquez set out from Hispaniola to conquer what is now known as the island of Cuba and subjugate Cuba&#x27;s indigenous people, the Taíno, who had previously been recorded by Christopher Columbus. Velázquez was preceded, however, by Hatuey, who fled Hispaniola with a party of four hundred in canoes and warned some of the Native people of eastern Cuba about what to expect from the Spaniards.

Bartolomé de Las Casas later attributed the following speech to Hatuey which was addressed against Christianity. He showed the Taíno of Caobana a basket of gold and jewels, saying:
:Here is the God the Spaniards worship. For these they fight and kill; for these they persecute us and that is why we have to throw them into the sea... They tell us, these tyrants, that they adore a God of peace and equality, and yet they usurp our land and make us their slaves. They speak to us of an immortal soul and of their eternal rewards and punishments, and yet they rob our belongings, seduce our women, violate our daughters. Incapable of matching us in valor, these cowards cover themselves with iron that our weapons cannot break...

The Taíno chiefs in Cuba did not respond to Hatuey&#x27;s message, and few joined him to fight. Hatuey resorted to guerrilla tactics against the Spaniards, and was able to confine them for a time. He and his fighters were able to kill at least eight Spanish soldiers. Eventually, using mastiffs and torturing the native people for information, the Spaniards succeeded in capturing him. On 2 February 1512, he was tied to a stake and burned alive at Yara, near the present-day city of Bayamo.

Before he was burned, a priest asked Hatuey if he would accept Jesus and go to heaven. Las Casas recalled the reaction of the chief:
:[Hatuey], thinking a little, asked the religious man if Spaniards went to heaven. The religious man answered yes... The chief then said without further thought that he did not want to go there but to hell so as not to be where they were and where he would not see such cruel people. This is the name and honour that God and our faith have earned.

==Legacy==
Hatuey is considered &quot;Cuba&#x27;s first national hero&quot; and one of the earliest fighters against Spanish colonialism. The town of Hatuey, located south of Sibanicú in the Camagüey Province of Cuba, was named after him.

Hatuey also lives on as a beer brand name. Beer has been brewed in Santiago de Cuba and sold under the Hatuey brand name since 1927, initially by the native Cuban company, Compañia Ron Bacardi S.A. After nationalization of industry in 1960, brewing was taken over by Empresa Cerveceria Hatuey Santiago. Beginning in 2011, the Bacardi family again began making beers in the United States to market under the Hatuey label. Hatuey is also a brand of a type of sugary, non-alcoholic malt beverage called malta. Hatuey is also a Dominican brand of soda cracker.

The logo of the Cuban cigar and cigarette brand Cohiba is a picture of Hatuey.

In a 2010 film shot in Bolivia, &quot;Even the Rain&quot;, Hatuey is a main character in the film-within-the-film. The film includes a cinematic account of Hatuey&#x27;s execution.

In 2024, Heavy metal band 3 Bravo released a song titled Chief Hatuey, which is dedicated to the story of the Tainos chief.

=== Fine arts ===
The imagery of Hatuey has been appropriated and/or incorporated into diverse artistic genres, most notably into the Afro-Cuban Yiddish Opera, &quot;Hatuey: Memory of Fire&quot;. In the visual arts, multiple artists have used the Taíno chief&#x27;s image, most notably Cuban-American artist Ric Garcia, U.S. Marine Corps artist Donald Dickson, and Australian artist damefine, among others.

== Government ==
=== Local government ===

Carteret is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members, who are elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Carteret is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Carteret is Democrat Daniel J. Reiman, whose term of office ends December 31, 2022. The members of the Borough Council are Council President Dennis DiMascio (D, 2024), Vincent Bellino (D, 2025), Jorge Diaz (D, 2025), Ajmar &quot;AJ&quot; Johal (D, 2024), Randy Krum (D, 2026) and Susan R. Naples (D, 2026).

First elected in 2002, Reiman was paid an annual salary of $102,610 in 2016, placing him 13th among the highest-paid mayors in the state.

In May 2016, the borough council selected Ajmar Singh Johal from three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2018 that became vacant following the death of Joseph W. &quot;Skippy&quot; Sitarz the previous month.

Members of Carteret&#x27;s 13.9% South Asian community have been active in local government, serving on several governing boards and contesting elections. Members of notable activity in the government include Sultan M. Babar, an alternate member of the board of health and the head of its medical department. Babar also ran for borough council and was a candidate in the Democratic primaries. He has been chosen to represent the 10th delegate district part of Middlesex County, which consists of 18th and 19th state legislative districts, as a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Other members of notability are Amijit Cheema, member of the Planning Board; and Hardyal Singh Johal, former member of the Planning Board.

The Borough of Carteret hired its first firefighter in the late 19th century. The department relied on a single paid firefighter up until 1920, when paid staff was expanded to five firefighters to operate the borough&#x27;s first motorized fire truck. In the 1950s with the construction of the New Jersey Turnpike, which included an exit in Carteret, the department started to purchase trucks designed for safe operation fighting vehicle fires on busy high-speed highways.

In August 1990, a pipeline carrying jet fuel burst in Carteret. The Carteret Fire Department joined with personnel from GATX Terminals Corporation and the Middlesex County Hazardous Materials Unit to construct a temporary dike to prevent the fuel from flowing into the Arthur Kill.

Up until 2011, Carteret would request help from fireboats of the Fire Department of New York when there was a waterfront fire. In 2011, through the assistance of a FEMA Port Security Grant, the department acquired its first fireboat. The vessel cost $297,000.

In December 2014, the &quot;Courier News&quot; reported on an investigation of serious sexual harassment targeting the department&#x27;s sole female firefighter.

<text>Colonia is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Woodbridge Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 18,609.

==History==
In 1919, the New Jersey State Highway Commission built a new road that became part of the Lincoln Highway, an early plan to create a transcontinental highway. The stretch was constructed on the west side of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now the Northeast Corridor) from near the northeast of Dow Avenue between Colonia and Iselin to Cedar Street in Menlo Park, to avoid two railroad crossings. The old road is now Middlesex-Essex Turnpike and Thornall Street, on the east side of the tracks.

==Geography==
Colonia is in northeastern Middlesex County, in the northwest corner of Woodbridge Township. It is bordered to the north by Clark, to the northeast by Rahway, to the east by Avenel, to the south by Iselin, and to the west by Edison. Union County borders the community to the north and northeast. Newark is to the northeast, and New Brunswick, the Middlesex county seat, is to the southwest.

The community is drained to the northeast by the South Branch of the Rahway River, part of the watershed of the Arthur Kill. Colonia has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and average monthly temperatures range from in January to in July.

The Garden State Parkway passes through the western portion of the CDP but does not interchange there. For northbound Garden State Parkway traffic only there is a service plaza in Colonia; it is the parkway&#x27;s only area located on private property.

In 2018 the president of the Historical Association of Woodbridge, Daniel D&#x27;Arcy, stated that &quot;Colonia is to Woodbridge like the Bronx is to NYC. People like the identity.&quot;

<text>Cranbury is a township in southern Middlesex County, within the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 3,842, a decrease of 15 (−0.4%) from the 2010 census count of 3,857, which in turn reflected an increase of 630 (+19.5%) from the 3,227 counted in the 2000 census.

Located within the Raritan Valley region, Cranbury is roughly equidistant between New York City and Philadelphia, contributing to it being a regional historical, cultural, and commercial hub of Central New Jersey (the township is known for its logistics industry) and as an outer-ring commuter suburb of New York City within the New York metropolitan area. The municipal taxes generated by the industrial properties have helped to keep residential property taxes steady over time.

== History ==
A deed for a sale of land and improvements dated March 1, 1698, is the earliest evidence of buildings constructed in present-day Cranbury. A home in Cranbury was used by Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette as a headquarters during the American Revolutionary War, and they were visited by General George Washington on June 26, 1778. It was during this visit, when George Washington hedged out plans to intercept the British&#x27;s retreat from Philadelphia to New York City, during the tail end of Britain&#x27;s Philadelphia campaign. This continued pursuit led to the fated events of the Battle of Monmouth (which took place nearby in modern-day Freehold Township and Manalapan Township, preserved currently as Monmouth Battlefield State Park), a major turning point for the Revolutionary War. As part of orders issued during the presidency of George Washington, maps of Cranbury were made showing the presence of a church, a mill and 25 other buildings. Fleeing after he killed Alexander Hamilton in their 1804 duel, Aaron Burr stopped in Cranbury to exchange horses and eat a local inn.

During its earliest years, the location was usually spelled as &quot;Cranberry&quot;. Rev. Joseph G. Symmes argued in 1857 that the name was spelled improperly and that the suffix &quot;bury&quot; was more appropriate, leading the name of the community and brook to be changed to &quot;Cranbury&quot; in 1869. The name has been attributed to wild cranberries that grew in the area. The so-called Hightstown rail accident occurred in or near Cranbury, in 1833. According to John Quincy Adams, who was aboard the train and who wrote in his diary about it, the train was from Hightstown when the disaster struck, putting the accident near what is now Cranbury Station. Among the passengers aboard were Tyrone Power and Cornelius Vanderbilt.

Cranbury was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 7, 1872, from portions of both Monroe Township and South Brunswick Township. Portions of the township were taken on April 1, 1919, to form Plainsboro Township. The township celebrated its tricentennial in 1998. Updike Parsonage Barn, originally constructed 1759, was disassembled, relocated and reconstructed in 2010 at its current location in Barn Park.

<text>Dunellen () is a borough in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located within the Raritan Valley region of central New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,637, an increase of 410 (+5.7%) from the 2010 census count of 7,227, which in turn had reflected an increase of 404 (+5.9%) from the 6,823 counted at the 2000 census.

Dunellen was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on October 28, 1887, when it broke away from Piscataway Township, based on the results of a referendum held on March 23, 1886. Dunellen&#x27;s incorporation was confirmed on April 15, 1914. The borough was named for the Dunellen station of the Central Railroad of New Jersey.

==History==
The earliest inhabitants of the area that would become Dunellen were the Lenape Native Americans; several Lenape sites in Dunellen were identified as part of a comprehensive survey in 1915. European settlers were drawn to the area as early as 1682, attracted by the productive agricultural land.

Railroad access from New York City to present-day Dunellen began in 1840. Dunellen grew from its start in 1867 with the construction of a railroad station, which was originally called New Market station, serving the nearby community of the same name in Piscataway. When it was originally constructed, the tracks were at grade level with North Avenue and the railroad was the Elizabethtown and Somerville Railroad, which later became part of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The Central Railroad of New Jersey created the residential development in the area which it owned surrounding its train station. The railroad brought industry to the area.

The Art Color factory built in 1925 was Dunellen&#x27;s principal industry and produced as many as 10 million magazines a month. The W. F. Hall Printing Company of Chicago bought Art Color in 1931, and ran it until 1968, when it closed the plant there.

<text>East Brunswick is a township in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The suburban bedroom community is part of the New York City metropolitan area and is located on the southern shore of the Raritan River, directly adjacent to the city of New Brunswick and located roughly away from New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 49,715, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 2,203 (+4.6%) from the 2010 census count of 47,512, which in turn reflected an increase of 756 (+1.6%) from the 46,756 counted in the 2000 census.

East Brunswick was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 28, 1860, from portions of both Monroe Township and North Brunswick Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Washington town within the township (February 23, 1870; became independent as South River on February 28, 1898), Helmetta (March 20, 1888), Milltown (January 29, 1889) and Spotswood (April 15, 1908).

Since the 2000 census, the United States Census Bureau calculated that New Jersey&#x27;s center of population was located in the township.

==History==

The general area of central New Jersey was originally occupied by the Lenape Native Americans. According to a 1677 bill of sale now in the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton, New Jersey, Thomas Lawrence, a New York baker, purchased thousands of acres of land from local Native Americans named Querameck, Kesyacs, Isarick, Metapis, Peckawan, and Turantecas.

In this document, the area is called Piscopeek, which later become known as Lawrence Brook, after its purchaser. Around the late 17th century, settlers began arriving in the northern part of East Brunswick, and by the mid-19th century, a small settlement had formed in the southeastern part, known as the Old Bridge section of the town, an area that was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, the Old Bridge Historic District.

The area today known as East Brunswick was incorporated in 1860 from parts of North Brunswick and Monroe townships, including the community of Old Bridge. Originally a farming community, suburban settlement started in the 1930s with improved road access. Large scale housing and road construction, especially after World War II, transformed East Brunswick into a more suburban community. The extension of the New Jersey Turnpike to East Brunswick in 1952 led to a sharp spike in population growth, with the 1950 Census population of 5,699 more than tripling to 19,965 as of the 1960 enumeration.

In the early 1970s, a citizens group called Concerned Citizens of East Brunswick sued the New Jersey Turnpike Authority over a proposed major widening project. The citizens group effectively won the case, gaining concessions in turnpike design, scale and mitigation measures for noise and air quality. The citizens group presented technical data from their own experts and prevailed in what was one of the earliest technical confrontations regarding urban highway design related to environmental factors in U.S. history.

East Brunswick was also the site of the gunfight at Turnpike exit 9 shortly after midnight on May 2, 1973, in which a car being driven by Zayd Malik Shakur (born James F. Costan), with Assata Shakur (formerly JoAnne Chesimard) and Sundiata Acoli (born Clark Squire) as passengers, was stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike State Trooper James Harper, backed up by Trooper Werner Foerster in a second patrol vehicle. After Zayd Shakur was asked to step out of the car to address a discrepancy in his identification, a shootout ensued in which Trooper Foerster was shot twice in the head with his own gun and killed, Zayd Shakur was killed, and both Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were wounded.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 22.36 square miles (57.91 km2), including 21.78 square miles (56.42 km2) of land and 0.57 square miles (1.48 km2) of water (2.56%).

The township lies on exit 9 of the New Jersey Turnpike. Its Municipal Building, named for 1970s Mayor Jean Walling, is located southwest of New York City&#x27;s Times Square and northeast of Center City, Philadelphia. It takes approximately 45–60 minutes to reach Midtown Manhattan in New York City or Center City, Philadelphia, depending on traffic and destination. Route 18 runs through the eastern part of the township, as it serves as a vital route in Central Jersey for access to the Jersey Shore and interior parts of the state. East Brunswick&#x27;s pristine suburbs and its convenience to major highways for leisure and for work, have contributed to it being a popular place for New York City commuters.

East Brunswick is located in the heart of the Raritan Valley region, as the township is located right on the southern shore of the Raritan River. The Lawrence Brook, a major tributary of the Raritan River, runs along the western border of the township. Farrington Lake and Westons Mill Pond are sections of the Lawrence Brook that have been widened by the presence of man-made dames. The South River, another major tributary of the Raritan River, runs along the eastern border of the township near the historic village of Old Bridge. The Manalapan Brook&#x27;s watershed (a tributary of the South River) encompasses much of the southern half of the township near Spotswood and Monroe, whereas the aforementioned Lawrence Brook&#x27;s watershed encompasses much of the northern half of the township near Milltown and the other Brunswicks.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Brookview, Dunhams Corner, Fairview Knolls, Farrington Lake Heights, Gillilandtown, Halls Corner, Herberts, Herberts Corner, Herbertsville, Jamesburg Park, Lawrence Brook, Lawrence Brook Manor, Newton Heights, Old Bridge, Orchard Heights, Patricks Corner, Paulas Corner, Tanners Corner, Washington Heights and Westons Mills., Country Lane

The township borders the Middlesex County municipalities of Edison, Helmetta, Milltown, Monroe Township, New Brunswick, North Brunswick, Old Bridge, Sayreville, South River, South Brunswick and Spotswood.

==Climate==
East Brunswick sits at the border between a humid continental climate according to the 0-degree-Celsius isotherm and a humid subtropical climate.

==Law and government==

=== Local government ===
The Township of East Brunswick was established in 1860. Since January 1, 1965, the Township has operated within the Faulkner Act under the Mayor-Council Plan E form of municipal government, which is used in 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the five-member Township Council, with all members elected at-large as part of the November general election in even-numbered years. The mayor and two council seats are up for vote together during Presidential election years, with the other seats up for vote two years later. Serving on a part-time basis as the chief executive of the community, the Mayor votes only in the case of a tie on a vote by the Township Council and can veto ordinances, but vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the council. The Township Council adopts ordinances; adopts a budget after review and revisions; makes appropriations; sets taxes and bond issues; creates and abolishes jobs via ordinance; sets salaries and establishes municipal policy. The council has the authority to initiate hearings for the purposes of gathering information for ordinance making, airing public problems and supervising the spending of its appropriations.

, the mayor of East Brunswick is Democrat Brad J. Cohen, whose term of office ends December 31, 2024. Members of the Township Council are Council President Kevin McEvoy (D, 2026), Council Vice President Dana Zimbicki (D, 2024; elected to serve an unexpired term), Dinesh Behal (D, 2024), James Wendell (D, 2026) and Dana Winston (D, 2026).

Dana Zimbicki was appointed in February 2022 to fill the seat expiring in December 2024 that was vacated the previous month by Michael Spadafino. Zimbicki served on an interim basis until the November 2022 election, when voters chose her to serve the remainder of the term of office.

In February 2021, the Township Council appointed Dinesh Behal from a list of three candidates submitted by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2024 that had been held by Sterley Stanley until he resigned from office the previous month to take office in the New Jersey General Assembly; Behal served on an interim basis until the November 2021 general election, when he was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

Elected as a Republican, James Wendell announced in July 2017 that he was switching parties, giving Democrats control of the Township Council.

In February 2014, the Township Council appointed Michael Spadafino to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by Nancy Pinkin, until she stepped down the previous month to take office in the New Jersey General Assembly. In the November 2014 general election, Spadafino was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

David Stahl served as mayor from his election in 2012 until his resignation on January 14, 2016, when he left office to take on a judge position in nearby Woodbridge Township. The Township Council appointed Kevin McEvoy, a former history teacher at East Brunswick High School and trustee of the East Brunswick Public Schools, to serve the balance of Stahl&#x27;s term as mayor that expired in December 2016; McEvoy stated that he would not run to serve a full term as mayor.

Republicans took control of the Township Council for the first time in 14 years in 2010, as Camille Ferraro, Mike Hughes and James Wendell swept the three seats that were up for election, with voter sentiment focused on controversy over a redevelopment plan for a parcel of land known as the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot;. Hughes, the youngest council member ever elected, said the stalled project was keeping property taxes disproportionately high on residents and called for revitalization of business.

The school plans to build a permanent structure as part of the Campus for Jewish Life (formerly known as the YM-YWHA of Raritan Valley) to replace its current facility the school has rented located near Trinity Presbyterian Church. Concerns have been raised regarding the funding for the school, which will come from the East Brunswick Board of Education budget, including $1.34 million for the 2010–2011 school year, and that the district will not be able to reduce expenses by the amount that will be paid to the charter school.

The school received $75,000 in grants from foundations to cover the costs of applying for a charter and for getting the school operational.

<doc id="125414" wikidata="Q746801" url="?curid=125414" title="Edison, New Jersey">
<text>Edison is a township located in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Situated in Central New Jersey within the core of the state&#x27;s Raritan Valley region, Edison is a commercial hub (home to Menlo Park Mall and Little India) and is a bedroom community of New York City within the New York metropolitan area.

As of the 2020 United States census, the township was the state&#x27;s sixth-most-populous municipality, with a population of 107,588, an increase of 7,621 (+7.6%) from the 2010 census count of 99,967, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,280 (+2.3%) from the 97,687 counted in the 2000 census.

What is now Edison Township was originally incorporated as Raritan Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 17, 1870, from portions of both Piscataway and Woodbridge Township. The township got its original name from the Raritan indigenous people. Portions of the township were taken to form Metuchen on March 20, 1900, and Highland Park on March 15, 1905. The name was officially changed to Edison Township on November 10, 1954, in honor of inventor Thomas Edison, who had his main laboratory in the Menlo Park section of the township.

===Early history===

The earliest residents of the area were the Raritan people of the Lenape Native Americans, who lived in the area and travelled through it to the shore. In 1646, Chief Matouchin led a group of 1,200 warriors.

Edison Township, which was formed from sections of Piscataway and Woodbridge townships, was settled (by Europeans) in the 17th century. The earliest village was Piscatawaytown, which is centered around St. James Church and the Piscatawaytown Common, near the intersection of Plainfield and Woodbridge Avenues in South Edison. The Laing House of Plainfield Plantation (listed on the National Register in 1988), the Benjamin Shotwell House (listed 1987) and the Homestead Farm at Oak Ridge (liste 1995), are buildings from the colonial era included in National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County.

The community was previously known as &quot;Raritan Township&quot;, not to be confused with the current-day Raritan Township in Hunterdon County.

===The Edison era===

In 1876, Thomas Edison set up his home and research laboratory in New Jersey on the site of an unsuccessful real estate development in Raritan Township called &quot;Menlo Park&quot;, (currently located in Edison State Park). While there he earned the nickname &quot;the Wizard of Menlo Park&quot;. Before his death at age 83 in 1931, the prolific inventor amassed a record 1,093 patents for creations including the phonograph, a stock ticker, the motion-picture camera, the incandescent light bulb, a mechanical vote counter, the alkaline storage battery including one for an electric car, and the first commercial electric light.

The Menlo Park lab was significant in that was one of the first laboratories to pursue practical, commercial applications of research. It was in his Menlo Park laboratory that Thomas Edison came up with the phonograph and a commercially viable incandescent light bulb filament. Christie Street was the first street in the world to use electric lights for illumination. Edison subsequently left Menlo Park and moved his home and laboratory to West Orange in 1886.

===20th century===
Near Piscatawaytown village, a portion of the township was informally known as &quot;Nixon&quot;, after Lewis Nixon, a manufacturer and community leader. Soon after the outbreak of World War I, Nixon established a massive volatile chemicals processing facility there, known as the Nixon Nitration Works. It was the site of the 1924 Nixon Nitration Works disaster, a massive explosion and resulting fire that killed 20 people and destroyed several square miles of the township.

In 1954, the township&#x27;s name was changed to honor inventor Thomas A. Edison. Also on the ballot in 1954 was a failed proposal to change the community&#x27;s name to Nixon.

In 1959, the Menlo Park Mall, a two-level super regional shopping mall, opened on U.S. Route 1.

==Government==
===Local government===
Edison Township operates within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council form of government, which was implemented as of January 1, 1958, based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. Edison&#x27;s governing body is comprised of the mayor and the seven-member Township Council. Members of the council are elected at-large in partisan elections held as part of the November general election to four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three or four seats coming up for election in odd-numbered years, with the mayoral seat up for vote at the same time that three seats are expiring.

, the Mayor of Edison is Democrat Samip &quot;Sam&quot; Joshi, whose term of office ends December 31, 2025. Members of the Township Council are Council President Nishith Patel (D, 2025), Council Vice President Margot Harris (D, 2025), Richard Brescher (D, 2027), Joseph Coyle (D, 2027), Ajay Patil (D, 2027) and John Poyner (D, 2025) and Asaf Shmuel (D, 2027).

The first (and to-date, only) female mayor of Edison was Antonia &quot;Toni&quot; Ricigliano, whose term of office ended on December 31, 2013.

====Election 2017 ====
Former Edison Democratic Chair and Detective Keith Hahn ran for mayor as a Republican against incumbent Mayor Thomas Lankey. Lankey was re-elected with 12,032 votes to Hahn&#x27;s 8,574 votes.

====Election 2016====
In June 2016, the Township Council selected Joseph Coyle from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that had been held by Robert Karabinchak, until he stepped down from office to take a vacant seat in the New Jersey General Assembly. Coyle served on an interim basis until the November 2016 general election, when voters elected him to fill the balance of the term of office.

====Election 2005====
Running on a good government platform and a call to reform the Democratic Party, Jun Choi won the June 2005 primary by a 56–44% margin, defeating longtime incumbent Mayor George A. Spadoro, the first time in Edison history that a challenger won the Democratic primary. An article in &quot;The American Prospect&quot; details aspects that Choi brought together in his 2005 mayoral campaign, including 1. attracting new voters into the process, 2. a good government message, 3. anti-Wal-Mart or economic justice theme and 4. an effective Internet-based progressive mobilization. In the general election, Jun Choi declared victory, leading in unofficial results with a vote of 12,126 to 11,935; a recount effort was unsuccessful. On January 1, 2006, at age 34, Choi was sworn in by Governor Jon Corzine as the youngest mayor in Edison history.

Recent politics in Edison have concerned plans for zoning the township to facilitate the creation of &quot;walkable&quot; communities that will attract businesses, while still maintaining open spaces and parks and easy access to commuter transit. This strategy is meant to encourage &quot;Smart Growth&quot;.

Politics in Edison since the 2005 mayoral election have been polarized by an attempt by retail giant Walmart to open a store in central Edison near the junction of Interstate 287 and New Jersey Route 27. Even though Jun Choi stated in his mayoral campaign that he would stop Walmart from being built, Walmart filed suit and won, and Choi was there to cut the yellow ribbon when the store was opened.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Roads and highways====
Edison is a transport hub, with an extensive network of highways passing through the township and connecting to major Northeast cities, New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Trenton and Washington, D.C.. Edison is located about from Newark Liberty International Airport, a 30 to 45 minute drive.

, the township had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Middlesex County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

State highways include Route 27 and 440, both of which are state-maintained. U.S. Route 1 also passes through the township. Interstate 287 passes through Edison, where it houses its southern end at I-95. The municipality also houses about a section of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95). Exit 10 is located in Edison, featuring a 13-lane toll gate and a unique interchange design. When the &quot;dual-dual&quot; setup of the turnpike was created, it first started in Edison and continued north to Exit 14 in Newark. It wasn&#x27;t until 1973 that the &quot;dual-dual&quot; was extended south of 10 to Exit 9 in East Brunswick Township (and then extended further south in 1990 to Exit 8A in Monroe Township).

Since Interstate 287 connects to Interstate 87 (the New York State Thruway), Exit 10 (of the turnpike) is one of the busiest interchanges to be used by tractor-trailers as it connects the New Jersey Turnpike to the New York Thruway. For truck drivers, it is the only direct limited-access road connection they have from the Turnpike to the Thruway as the Garden State Parkway, which has its northern terminus at the Thruway, prohibits trucks from using the roadway north of Exit 105.

In 2009, the New Jersey Department of Transportation selected Edison as one of the first communities to have a red light camera enforcement system. The program was ended by the state in December 2014, despite a more than 30% drop in accidents at the three camera-controlled intersections in the township.

* Central Office Rahway (Switch ID: RHWYNJRADS5) (Area Code 732): Serving from Wood Avenue North to Roxy Avenue on the west side of the Street inward to New Dover Road.
* Central Office Plainfield (Switch ID: PLFDNJPFDS5) (Area Code 908): Serving Roxy Avenue heading north into South Plainfield on both sides of Inman Avenue.
* Central Office Metuchen (Switch ID: MTCHNJMTDS5) (Area Code 732): Serving Edison, Metuchen and Iselin (Technically Iselin Numbers that have 732–283 and 732–404 are routed out of the Woodbridge Office Switch ID: WDBRNJWDDS5).
* Central Office Edison (Switch ID: EDSNNJEDDS5): Serving South Edison with phone numbers that come up as &quot;New Brunswick&quot; – 732–339, 732–393, 732–572, 732–777, 732–819, 732–985, and Exchanges for &quot;Metuchen&quot; that are 732–248, 732–287, 732–650.
* Central Office Fords (Switch ID: FRDSNJFRDS5): Serving Eastern Edison area and Raritan Center areas with 732–225, 732–346, 732–417, 732–512 and Perth Amboy Exchanges 732–661, 732–738.

In 1982, the BPU and New Jersey Bell, after receiving thousands of complaints from both North and South Edison residents, made an exception that any calls originating and terminating in the Township would be considered a local call. This was due to the new home construction in Edison where existing cables that belonged to the Rahway central office were assigned to give new phone service to over 400 homes.

In 1997, mandatory ten-digit dialing came to Edison with the introduction of Area code 732. Edison residents living on Roxy Avenue once again were in the spotlight in the news, with one side of the street served by the Rahway central office (Area code 732) and the other side of the street is served by the Plainfield central office (Area Code 908). Residents complained to the BPU and Bell Atlantic that it would be easier to yell across the street than dial a ten-digit number to call their neighbor across the street.

Edison has Cablevision&#x27;s Optimum cable television service. Before Cablevision, there was TKR, which was so poorly run that many FCC and BPU complaints about programming and many town hall meetings eventually forced change. TKR was bought out by Cablevision.

<text>Helmetta is a borough in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough is located in the heart of the Raritan Valley region, with Manalapan Brook (a Raritan River tributary) flowing through the center of the community. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 2,455, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 277 (+12.7%) from the 2010 census count of 2,178, which in turn reflected an increase of 353 (+19.3%) from the 1,825 counted in the 2000 census. The community was established around a snuff mill opened in the 1820s that was acquired by George Washington Helme in the 1880s.

Helmetta was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 20, 1888, when it was created from portions of East Brunswick, based on the results of a referendum held on March 10, 1888. Helmetta&#x27;s boundary with East Brunswick Township was changed as of March 24, 1897. The borough was named for Helme&#x27;s daughter, Olivia Antoinette &quot;Etta&quot; Helme.

==History==
===G. W. Helme Snuff Mill District===

Helmetta&#x27;s main landmark is the large, abandoned Helme Products Inc. plant that sits adjacent to the Camden and Amboy Railroad line running through the borough. The mill began producing snuff in the 1880s. On February 23, 1900, the mill was bought by the American-Sniff Company in a merger with Helme Products Inc., but the merger was dissolved in 1911. In 1925, the mill became the largest of its kind in the world, and by 1934 it employed 400 people. In 1986, the mill was bought out by American Maize-Products. Finally, in 1993, it was purchased by Swisher International, and operations were moved to Wheeling, West Virginia. In 2012, the mill was purchased by Kaplan Companies and was subsequently transformed into an apartment complex. The transformation was completed in 2017. 

The G. W. Helme Snuff Mill District is a classic example of a late 1800s mill town. The district consists of the George Washington Helme snuff mill, housing for employees, accessory buildings, St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church, and Helmetta Pond, which at one time served as a source of power for the mill. About 109 buildings were originally in the district, which was named to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on February 1, 1980, and to the National Register of Historic Places, on August 15, 1980.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.88 square miles (2.27 km2), including 0.83 square miles (2.15 km2) of land and 0.05 square miles (0.13 km2) of water (5.57%).

The borough borders the Middlesex County municipalities of East Brunswick, Monroe Township and Spotswood.

==Government==

===Local government===
Helmetta is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Helmetta is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Helmetta Borough is Independent Christopher Slavicek, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Helmetta Borough Council are Council President Peter J. Karczewski (R, 2024), Sandra Bohinski (I, 2026), Michael R. Duffy (R, 2024), Ronald Dzingleski (I, 2025), Joseph Reid (I, 2025) and Nicholas Stasi (I, 2026).

Samuel Mena was appointed in September 2021 to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Noreen Carolan-Genthe and Nicholas Stasi was appointed in October 2021 to fill the seat formerly held by Joseph Perez and also expiring in December 2021. Both Mena and Stasi will serve on an interim basis until the November 2021 general election when voters will select candidates to serve the balance of the terms of office.

In January 2016, Ronald Dzingleski and Joseph Reid were appointed to fill two of the three vacant council seats.

In April 2016, the borough council selected Noreen Carolan to fill the term expiring in December 2016 that had been held temporarily by Brian Hackett who had in turn been appointed to fill the seat held by Yvette Bruno.

In 2014, a recording of a police officer telling a cameraperson stating that he has the constitutional right to take video that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;give a damn&quot; about constitutional rights was made public. In response, the city government proposed an ordinance banning video and photography inside public buildings without a permit.

In April 2018, Helmetta disbanded its three-officer police force and entered into a six-year shared services agreement with Spotswood to provide police, dispatch and EMS services to Helmetta residents. The Spotswood Police Department is a 24/7 law enforcement agency that serves both Spotswood and Helmetta. The department has 22 officers, 3 full-time dispatchers, and 4 part-time dispatchers, led by Chief Michael Zarro. In July 2022, Helmetta and Jamesburg entered into a six-year shared service contract in which Jamesburg would provide police and dispatch services to Helmetta. This decision came about after the Borough of Spotswood decided that providing dispatch services to Helmetta was not economically viable. 

In 2018, the borough had an average property tax bill of $6,270, the lowest in the county, compared to an average bill of $8,092 in Middlesex County and $8,767 statewide.

An analysis of speeding tickets issued over an 18-month period between 2011 and 2013 showed that 222 tickets were issued in that timeframe with only two given to borough residents, which was cited as supporting claims that the borough&#x27;s police department is unfairly targeting non-residents.
