==History==
Euro-American settlement in the Schoolcraft area dates to 1828 (nine years before Michigan&#x27;s admission to the Union), when Bazel Harrison moved his family from Ohio to present-day Prairie Ronde Township, becoming the first settler in the future Kalamazoo County. The village itself was established in 1831 by surveyor (and future statesman) Lucius Lyon, who had first visited the area as a surveyor under government contract in 1823. Recorded on October 5, 1831, Schoolcraft was the first town in Kalamazoo County. Lyon named the village for his friend Henry Schoolcraft. Schoolcraft was a key member of the 1820 Cass Expedition, organized by territorial governor Lewis Cass to explore the Michigan Territory; the expedition played an important role in encouraging settlement of the territory.

Territorial roads from Schoolcraft to the mouth of the Black River were approved in 1833 and to Edwardsville in 1834. State roads to Edwardsburg, St. Joseph were approved by the Michigan legislature in the 1835–36 session. By Act of State Legislature March 14, 1840, two state roads from Schoolcraft were approved for construction. One road was to be built to Abscota (also found as Abscot), a post office in Calhoun County, Township 4 South, Range 7 West at the corners of Section 5, 6, 7, 8. John Kelly and E.L. Brown of Kalamazoo and Salmon Walker of Calhoun County were appointed to oversee this route. Another road was to be built from Schoolcraft to Albion with E. Larkin Brown and Albert E. Bull of Schoolcraft and Jesse Crowel of Albion as commissionors to lay out and establish said road. In 1844, a state road from Battle Creek to Schoolcraft was authorized. In 1845, a state road from Schoolcraft connecting to the Territorial Road was authorized.

Schoolcraft was incorporated as a General Law Village on January 4, 1866. It was reincorporated March 12, 1869, and received its new charter in 1875.

==Local Historic Sites==
The Schoolcraft home of Dr. Nathan Thomas served as a &quot;station&quot; on the Underground Railroad. Dr. Thomas, the first doctor in Kalamazoo County and a Quaker who avidly supported and led abolitionist efforts in Michigan, first built the house in 1835 on the corner of Cass St. and Centre St. Between 1840 and 1860, it is estimated that Dr. Thomas and his wife Pamela Brown Thomas sheltered between 1,000 and 1,500 fugitive slaves on their way to Canada. Dr. Thomas built a new house in 1868 and the original house was moved to its present site on Cass St. east of U.S. Route 131. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a registered Michigan Historical Site.

The Schoolcraft United Methodist Church has stood on the corner of Grand Street and Clay Street in Schoolcraft since the early 1850s. The congregation was organized in Prairie Ronde Township in 1832. Its first chapel, called the Ebenezer Episcopal Church of Prairie Ronde, built in 1836, was the first church building of any denomination constructed north of the St. Joseph River.

Cooper&#x27;s Island is an approximately woodland located about 1/4 mile west of U.S. Route 131 on West Eliza St. Containing a rich and rare assortment of mesic forest plants and trees, the woods are the remnant of the Big Island on Prairie Ronde, an island of forest in the midst of prairie at the time of settlement. Famous as the setting for James Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s 1848 frontier novel &quot;The Oak Openings&quot;, Cooper&#x27;s Island is a listed Michigan Historical Site.

The Schoolcraft Ladies Library (at 163 Hayward St.), built in 1896, is also a state listed site. The Ladies Library Association had been founded in 1879 to provide educational opportunities to women in the community (there were no state educational institutions in the area until Western Normal College, now Western Michigan University, was established in Kalamazoo in 1903).

==Schools==
There are four schools in the Schoolcraft Community Schools school district.

Schoolcraft Early Elementary – Schoolcraft Early Elementary serves approximately 260 students in the Young Fives, Kindergarten, First Grade and Second Grade. The Kindergarten and Young Fives programs are offered half day, every day in the morning or afternoon. The Elementary school is the oldest occupied school in the district, with the original portion of the school having been built in the 1930s. Until completion of the old high school (which is currently the middle school) in the 1950s, this building housed all students in K-12.

Schoolcraft Upper Elementary – The Upper Elementary in Schoolcraft consists of grades 3, 4, and 5, and currently has 342 students enrolled. Grade levels 3, 4, and 5 are the traditional self-contained classrooms. Students in those grade levels do leave their classrooms for specials (physical education, art, computers, library skills, and music).

Schoolcraft Middle School – The Schoolcraft Middle School aims to prepare productive, respectful problem solvers for their next educational endeavor through delivering a challenging, integrated curriculum in a positive environment by a skilled staff. Grades 6th through 8th.

Schoolcraft High School – Grades 9–12. The current high school, which is the newest building in the district&#x27;s school system, has been occupied since the 1999–2000 school year, with construction being completed in 2000. Due to cooperation with other schools in Kalamazoo County, students also have the opportunity to attend classes at off-campus locations through programs such as the Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Education for Employment and Education for the Arts.

*Torch River is an unincorporated community at at the south end of Torch Lake, where the eponymous Torch River exits the lake and is joined by the Rapid River. A portion of the community is on the west side of the river in Milton Township, Antrim County.

==History==

The first permanent white settler in what is now Kalkaska County was William George Copeland, a farmer born in Nottinghamshire, who located there in the fall of 1855, while it was still attached to Grand Traverse County. For the next twelve years, he and his wife were the only permanent white residents of the county. A dam had been built on the Barker Creek about the time Copeland moved there, but a planned mill was never built. The next permanent resident in the township was William H. Bockes, a native of Medina County, Ohio and a Civil War veteran. In June 1866, he purchased land in the township near Barker Creek. After returning to Ohio to marry his wife in October, they both returned immediately to take up residence. Another early resident in the Barker Creek area was John H.F. Letherby, born in England and moved to Canada at the age of 16. He settled in section 32 near Barker Creek in October 1866.

The township was organized in 1867.

In section 36 in the southeast corner of the township, a few related families originally from Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, made their homes. D.P. Beebe, another Civil War veteran, was the first to arrive in the spring of 1867. Norman Ross, his father-in-law came in the summer of 1867 and became the first township supervisor when it was organized. A.C. Beebe, also a Civil War veteran, came in May 1868.

Elisha W. Clement, from Brantford, Ontario settled in section 14 in December 1867. Albert T. Kellogg, from Cortland County, New York, settled in section 14 in September 1868.

Kalkaska County remained unorganized and attached to first Grand Traverse County and then Antrim County until an act of the Michigan Legislature of January 27, 1871. Rapid River Township was the first township organized in the county, while it was still attached to Antrim County for administrative purposes. The township was organized in 1868 so that residents in the area would be able to vote in the presidential election without having to travel all the way to Antrim County. At that time, Rapid River Township encompassed several townships that were later separately organized. Clearwater Township was originally organized as &quot;Round Lake&quot; by an act of the Michigan Legislature on January 18, 1871, and was renamed Clearwater Township in January 1873. A post office with the name of &quot;Clear Water&quot; had been established in May 1869 and renamed &quot;Clearwater&quot; in December 1873. There was also a post office at Barker Creek from February 1874 until May 1937. Barker Creek was a station on the Chicago and West Michigan Railway (now the Pere Marquette Railroad).

==Geography==

Torch Lake borders the northern edge of the township, and Lake Skegemog occupies a portion of the western section of the township. Rapid River flows through the center of the township.

<text>Kalkaska ( ) is a village in the U.S. state of Michigan. Its population was 2,132 at the 2020 census, an increase from 2,020 at the 2010 census.

Kalkaska is part of the Traverse City metropolitan area and is often considered a bedroom community of nearby Traverse City. The town is also renowned for hosting the National Trout Festival, with the first festivities being held in 1935.

== History ==
The land on which Kalkaska sits has long been territory under the Council of Three Fires, the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi.

In 1872, Albert A. Abbott arrived on the land set to become the village from his hometown of Decatur. The following year, on May 12, Abbott platted his land and became its first postmaster. In 1874, Kalkaska became a station on a new Pennsylvania Railroad line from Walton to Petoskey. Today, this line is part of the Great Lakes Central Railroad.

On July 5, 1908, a fire began in the middle of the business block and burned most of the stores. Local photographer E. L. Beebe took a number of photographs of the fire; the resulting postcards were widely sold and can still be found today. Two years later, another fire started in downtown Kalkaska. Again, in 1925, downtown Kalkaska was devastated by the largest fire since the fire of 1908.

In 1916, noted author Ernest Hemingway visited and fished in Kalkaska, and later immortalized the town in his story &quot;The Battler&quot;. A historical marker has been placed at the nearby Rugg Pond, on the Rapid River, where Hemingway reportedly fished one night from the power house.

On July 10, 1951, the Kalkaska State Bank was robbed by an armed man, who fled and later attempted to escape on foot through a nearby swampy area. After three days of what was termed the largest manhunt in Northern Michigan history, involving the FBI and local and state authorities, the gunman, Raymond J. Turcotte, who had a long string of prior convictions, including manslaughter, was captured south of the town. Turcotte confessed to the bank robbery and served 18 years in the Michigan State Prison in Jackson, including a term for escape in 1961.

Discovery of natural gas and oil in the area during the 1970s lead to significant growth for the village, but the growth has since shifted toward tourism.

In 1993, the Kalkaska schools made national headlines when a financial crisis resulted in a two-month-long closure. Subsequent funding reform improved the outlook for Kalkaska and similar small rural districts in Michigan.

In 2014, Walmart announced plans to open a store in Kalkaska. Previously, the closest store was in Traverse City, over 20 miles away. A debate in Kalkaska ensued on whether the community&#x27;s small-town character could be preserved. The store was never built due to Walmart&#x27;s decision to restructure growth plans.

The &quot;Record Eagle&quot; reported in 2019 that Kalkaska was poised for substantial growth due to housing shortages in the Traverse City area.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which are covered by water.

The North Branch of the Boardman River flows through the south of the village. The river continues west into neighboring Grand Traverse County, turns north, and empties into Grand Traverse Bay, a bay of Lake Michigan. Just to the north of the village, though, are the headwaters of the Little Rapid River. This stream also flows into the Grand Traverse Bay, although it is part of the Chain of Lakes watershed.

The primary constructors of Kalkaska&#x27;s geographical make-up are ancient glaciers, along with most of Michigan. Glaciers scoured the surface of the state during the Ice Age, creating small hills called drumlins, along with valleys and basins and the water that currently occupies them in the process called glaciation.

Kalkaska experiences a notable amount of snowfall, as it is located in a snowbelt that receives heavy amounts of lake-effect snow from Lake Michigan.

<text>Ada Township ( ) is a civil township of Kent County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 14,388 at the 2020 census.

The majority of the township is included in the Forest Hills census-designated place, which is used only for statistical purposes. Ada Township is part of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area and is about east of the city of Grand Rapids. The township is the corporate home of Alticor and its subsidiary companies Amway North America and Amway.

==Communities==
Ada, also known as Ada Village, is an unincorporated community within the township. It is located on M-21, about east of Grand Rapids. Ada contains its own post office with the 49301 ZIP Code that serves the majority of the township. Ada was settled as early as 1821 when Rix Robinson built a trading post near the area to trade furs with a local Ottawa village. Robinson made the first land purchase here in 1833, and a settlement developed along the Thornapple River. A post office was established in 1837. Both the township and village settlement were named for Ada Smith, the daughter of the first postmaster. The settlement was given a station on the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad (later part of the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway). A plat was recorded in 1857.

Forest Hills is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) that occupies the majority of the township for statistical purposes. The CDP occupies (or 88.90%) of the township. Forest Hills also occupies a large portion of Cascade Township to the south and is the largest and most-populated CDP in the state.

==History==
At the turn of the 19th century, the land that would become Ada was a village of the Grand River Band of Ottawa, led by Nebawnaygezhick.

During the early colonial settlement of Michigan, Rix Robinson, the first permanent colonial settler of Kent County, married Sebequay (&quot;River Woman&quot;), the sister of Nebawnaygezhick, at Ada. In 1821, Robinson purchased a former French-Canadian trading post at the junction of the Grand and Thornapple rivers from Madeline La Framboise, on behalf of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s American Fur Company. Land north of the Grand River was not available for purchase by European-American settlers until after the United States signed the 1836 Treaty of Washington with regional tribes. Following the treaty, Robinson purchased hundreds of acres around the mouth of the Thornapple for the Ottawa to continue living on.

Lucius Lyon, an early settler, first visited Robinson&#x27;s settlement in 1826. Convinced that the land would become valuable, Lyon purchased large tracts from early settlers. He oversaw development of the land, including the construction of a saw mill. Both Lyon and Robinson are considered the founders of Ada.

There are conflicting reports concerning when the township was organized. Information provided by the township website indicates that Robinson was elected as the township&#x27;s first supervisor. However, other sources indicate it was organized on April 2, 1838, and that Sydney Smith was elected the first supervisor and that Robinson was the second, elected in 1841 and again in 1844. The village was named after Sydney Smith&#x27;s daughter, Ada Smith, who was the first non-Native American child born in the village.

The Ada Covered Bridge was constructed across the Thornapple in 1867. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is one of the few covered bridges that remain standing in the state.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (2.86%) is water.

<text>Cannon Township is a civil township of Kent County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 13,336 at the 2010 census.

The township was organized as a survey township in 1845. It is part of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area and is located about northeast of the city of Grand Rapids.

==Communities==
* Cannonsburg is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in the southeast part of the township.
* Chauncey (also known as Buena Vista and Imperial Mills) is an unincorporated, mostly historical settlement on the boundary between Cannon Township and Plainfield Township where Bear Creek enters the Grand River.

==History==
The area that would become Cannon Township was originally attached to neighboring Plainfield Township. In 1837, Andrew Watson brought his family to Cannon and built the first farm in the township. Over the next decade, many other pioneers arrived and settled. In 1845, the township was split from Plainfield and took its present name. The state legislature organized Cannon Township as &quot;Churchtown&quot; in 1846. At the first town meeting, held in 1848, it was renamed &quot;Cannon&quot;, after Cannonsburg, the largest village.

The earliest land claims date from 1835. Families began settling permanently in 1839. Zebulon Rood purchased of land in 1840 and built Cannon&#x27;s first house, a log structure. He also cut the first road, making it possible to transport goods across Bear Creek. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the production of wheat, wool, corn, apples and other fruits supported the economy. This building served as the township hall from 1890 until 1987, when it became the Cannon Historical Museum.

The township took its name from the small settlement of Cannonsburgh, which had been founded in 1842 at the direction of LeGrand Cannon, described as an eastern capitalist. The hamlet had two mills and a store by 1845, and the town was platted to encourage residential growth. LeGrand Cannon was proud of his little town, and provided a fitting gift in appreciation: a small cannon inscribed with his name and date. The cannon was used by the townspeople to commemorate holidays, such as the 4th of July, until someone was hurt firing the ordnance. The cannon was then buried to prevent further injuries, but was later discovered and refitted for firing. Unfortunately, another person was subsequently injured while firing the cannon, and again it was buried, and has not been found again to this day.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Bowne Township has a total area of , of which is land and (4.63%) is water.

The water acreage comes from several small natural lakes in the township and an artificial one (Lake Bella Vista). The Grand River crosses the southwest corner of the township.

<text>East Grand Rapids is a city in Kent County in the U.S. state of Michigan. , the population was 11,371.

The city is part of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, including Grand Rapids and Grand Rapids Township, but the city is administered autonomously.

==History==
Originally part of Paris Township, East Grand Rapids was first settled in the early 1830s by the Reed Family from New York City, New York. Miss Sophia Reed and Miss Euphemia Davis opened a school in 1834 near Reeds Lake. This involved construction of some school houses. Another schoolhouse was constructed in 1835 near Reeds Lake in the Grand River Valley, with Francis Prescott as one of its teachers. Residents voted to establish the Village of East Grand Rapids in 1891. The village was incorporated into a home rule city in 1926 when the population was approximately 1,300.

East Grand Rapids saw tourism from the Grand Rapids area for its geography and facilities. Reeds Lake attracted visitors as early as the 1870s as a destination for day trips and summertime activities. Two bathing beaches were located on Reeds Lake. Manhattan Beach on the north shore was established in 1884 and Rose&#x27;s Bathing Beach on the west shore was established in 1901. They hosted boat launches, a bathhouse, restaurants, and resorts. Four steamboats owned by the Poisson family operated excursion rides on the lake starting in 1882.

Visitors to East Grand Rapids initially traveled by foot, stagecoach, or horse and buggy. In the mid-1870s, horse-drawn cars became available. Passengers would board in downtown Grand Rapids and transfer onto the Grand Rapids &amp; Reeds Lake Railway. By 1877, a steam locomotive replaced the horse cars. Electric streetcars came into use in the early 1890s. They were replaced by buses as a mode of transportation in 1935. Interurban also brought residents from nearby cities to Reeds Lake.

The village&#x27;s amusement park, Ramona Park, opened in 1897, a creation of the Grand Rapids Street Railway Company in order to increase use of their services. The park included amusement rides, games, concession stands, and two large pavilions where activities from theater to roller skating were hosted. Ramona Park closed in 1955 due to disrepair and dwindling demand. The land was eventually repurposed for apartments and a shopping center.

In 1974 East Grand Rapids came to national attention as the legal domicile of Gerald R. Ford, 38th President of the United States, however, as a serving Congressman and Vice-President, Ford had resided in the District of Columbia area for the previous twenty-five years.

A local developer completed a new retail center as part of a $50 million project, which is also intended to include offices and multi-floor condominium buildings spread over a tract. In 2006, the City of East Grand Rapids performed a $3 million refurbishing of Wealthy Street with new paving, lighting, and decorative features. A new 27,700 ft2 (2573.41 m2) library was opened in August 2006 at the site of the previous library on Reeds Lake, next to the Grand Rapids Yacht Club.

<text>Grandville is a city in Kent County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 15,378 at the 2010 census.

Grandville is just southwest of the city of Grand Rapids and is part of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area. It was first settled in 1833 and later incorporated as a city in 1933.

==History==
===Settlement===
Anishinaabe peoples are indigenous to the Grand Rapids metropolitan area. Grandville was geographically an important place during the logging years in Michigan&#x27;s history due to its location at the &quot;river-bend&quot; of the Grand River. It was important to have people there to make sure the logs did not jam up as the river turned north-west toward Grand Haven.

Grandville was founded in 1833 and incorporated as a city in 1933.

===Recent history===
By the 1980s due to the growth of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area following the early 1980s recession in the United States, Grandville began to experience even more growth. In 1987, color measurement and manufacturer X-Rite established its headquarters in the city a year after it went public, soon becoming one of the fastest growing businesses in Michigan.

In the 1990s, the city was being eyed for larger development. In 1990, developers explored the building of a new mall near the intersection of 44th Street and Ivanrest and eventually met with the city for approval. In 1999, construction was completed on RiverTown Crossings, a mall with just over 1.25 million square feet of retail space.

In the 2000s, Grandville experienced continued growth following the opening of Rivertown Crossings, including multiple restaurants and strip malls along Rivertown Parkway. It had grown to be one of the city&#x27;s largest employers. However, by 2007, the beginning of the Great Recession, X-Rite had moved its headquarters nearby to Kentwood.

A new fire station was constructed across the street from city hall at Prairie and Wilson in 2000 to make way for a new police station and hall of justice in 2003 next to city hall and a Kent District Library on Wilson Avenue.

In 2013, a Cabela&#x27;s and Target anchored a new development on the former X-Rite property. In 2016, a 1 million+ square foot, 400 unit apartment development called the Grand Castle was constructed.

In 2017, after arriving in Grand Rapids, then United States Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen made a visit for the annual Fourth of July ceremony and parade. Pence walked the traditional parade route of Wilson Avenue, from 44th Street to Chicago Drive. During the parade, citizens held signs in a peaceful protest. Pence tweeted after the visit thanking Grandville for the parade. Mayor Steve Maas responded with a letter.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (5.93%) is water.

The Grand River forms the northern border of the city, and the city of Grand Rapids is just to the northeast, while Walker is to the north and Wyoming surrounds the city on the east and south. Ottawa County is to the west.

<text>Lowell is a city in Kent County of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,783 at the 2010 census.

Lowell is part of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area and is about east of the city of Grand Rapids.

The city&#x27;s downtown area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Downtown Lowell Historic District.

==History==
The earliest modern residents of the Flat River and Grand River were the Grand River Odawa, who established several villages along the Grand River. In the first decades of the 19th century, the village was led by Wabiwindego and Keewaycooshcum, and later by Cobmoosa. In the 1830s, Cobmoosa purchased the land under the Odawa village in the name of his father, fur trader Antoine Campau. The Odawa remained at their village on the Flat River until 1858, when they moved to a reservation at Manistee, Michigan.

The modern city of Lowell was founded in 1831 by Daniel Marsac as a trading post with this existing Odawa village, built on the south bank of the Grand River. During the first years of his trading post, Marsac lived with the Grand River Odawa leader Wabiwindego. In 1847, he purchased land on the north side of the river and platted it as &quot;Dansville&quot;. In 1851, a post office was established there named &quot;Lowell&quot; after the township. The community was replatted in 1854 and renamed after the post office. It incorporated as a village in 1861.

==History==
The area was first settled by Marlin Hunter, who settled along the Rogue River in 1842. By 1845, several other families arrived and settled the community under the name Laphamville, and the community received a post office under that name. The community was platted in 1865 and incorporated as a village in 1866. At that time, the community&#x27;s name changed to Rockford. The community was originally based around the lumber industry but was soon supported by a shoe factory and tannery at the turn of the century. The village incorporated as a city in 1935.

Wolverine World Wide has major operations in the city for over 100 years. In modern times, its former tannery site used Scotchgard chemicals to waterproof shoes, which contaminated local areas with the active ingredients at the time of PFOA and PFOS.

The downtown area hosts a summer farmer&#x27;s market on Saturday. The city also hosts a Fall Harvest Festival. Start of Summer Celebration is a community organization annually held in early June at the beginning of summertime.

Prior to the consolidation, Sand Lake High School, a K-12 school, served the community. Impetus for consolidation occurred when the State of Michigan adopted new standards for education which required school systems to spend additional funds. Some Sand Lake residents wished to consolidate with Cedar Springs Schools in Cedar Springs due to the strength of the Cedar Springs industrial economy and the good reputation of its school system, while others wished to consolidate with Howard City. Charles Northup, a former member of the Sand Lake school board, stated that Cedar Springs residents would have had primary control and naming of a consolidated school district including Sand Lake, while a consolidation with Howard City would result in joint control between the communities. According to a former principal of Sand Lake High, Earl Clegg, &quot;community friction&quot; occurred in the consolidation debate. About 300 people went to a meeting in Sand Lake on proposed school consolidation on February 13, 1961.

The Nelson Township Branch of the Kent District Library is located in Sand Lake.

<text>Sparta is a village in Kent County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,244 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Sparta Township.

Sparta is part of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area and is located about north of the city of Grand Rapids.

==History==
The Sparta area was first settled in 1844, with the township formally organized in 1846. The first settler in what is now the village was Jonathan Nash in 1846. Calling the place Nashville, he built a sawmill on Lick Creek. Subsequently, he changed the name of the creek to Nash Creek. Seeing as there was already a Nashville in Michigan, the state legislature suggested Sparta. The village was platted in 1867 and incorporated in 1883. 

During World War II, Sparta was host to a German prisoner of war camp. The POWs were put to work as farmhands because many of the farmhands from the town had left to go fight in the war. The prisoners were treated relatively well, and later even wrote letters to the owner of the farm they worked on saying such things as, &quot;I like to think back on the nice time we could spend on your farm.&quot;

===Music===
In the early to late 1960s, Sparta was home to Fenton Records, an independent record company and recording studio. The label recorded many local bands, as well as other Michigan garage bands. Due to the limited runs of the records, Fenton vinyl 45rpms are highly collectable, often selling for hundreds of dollars each. Many of the records were compiled on a CD called &quot;Scream Loud!!!: The Fenton Records Story&quot; (Way Back Records).

<doc id="117865" wikidata="Q1022953" url="?curid=117865" title="Wyoming, Michigan">
<text>Wyoming is a city in Kent County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 76,501 at the 2020 census. Wyoming is the second most-populated community in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area and is bordered by Grand Rapids on the northeast. After Grand Rapids, it is also the second most-populated city in West Michigan.

The area was the second location in Kent County settled by European-Americans in 1832 on the edges of Buck Creek and was organized as Wyoming Township in 1848 when it was set off from the northern half of Byron Township. Through the 1800s and into the early 1900s, Wyoming served as a rural area providing goods to Grand Rapids, though with the introduction of the Grand Rapids, Holland and Chicago Railway, the township experienced suburbanization. After Grandville separated from the township in 1933 and Wyoming experienced more growth with the opening of the General Motors Stamping Division Plant, Wyoming was engaged in annexation conflicts with Grand Rapids and Grandville until the township became incorporated as the city of Wyoming in 1959.

After obtaining cityhood, Wyoming served as an entertainment and retail destination on the 28th Street corridor with the opening of Rogers Plaza and Studio 28. Into the 1980s, the quality of development in Wyoming began to falter and with the 1999 opening of RiverTown Crossings in Grandville, retail businesses in the city were upended. Development in Wyoming then shifted towards the southwest panhandle near RiverTown Crossings in the early 21st century and has continued in the area surrounding Metro Health Hospital following its opening in 2007, though General Motors closed the stamping plant two years later in 2009. Since the mid-2010s, the city has focused on redeveloping its center on 28th Street with the 28 West project as well as the of former General Motors land, now known as Site 36.

Native Americans of the Hopewellian culture inhabited the region from ca. 400 B.C. to A.D. 400. Classified as the Goodall focus, a Hopewell sub-grouping, they created a series of structures known as Norton Mound group with the mounds probably being constructed in the first century AD. Odawa tribes were established in the area near present-day Wyoming, with the village of the ogema Black Skin, natively known as Muck-i-ta-oska or Mukatasha, ranging from the southwest present-day Grand Rapids to the Grand River across from the Norton Mound group, with the mouth of the Black Skin Creek leading into the Grand River across from the mounds. Where what is now Grandville, Michigan, a prairie existed west of Wyoming where up to ten native families under the ogema As-to-quet, who were friendly with early settlers in the area, held planting grounds.

=== Little Prairie settlement ===
In the late 1700s, French fur traders traversed the Grand River Valley. Lucius Lyon, a Yankee Protestant, was contracted by the federal government to survey the Grand River Valley in the fall of 1830 and in the first quarter of 1831, the federal survey of the Northwest Territory reached the Grand River, setting the boundaries for Kent County, named after prominent New York jurist James Kent. Lyon would also survey &quot;Township Nº VI West, Range Nº XII North&quot;, which would become Wyoming. The area that is now the city of Wyoming was the second location settled by European-Americans in Kent County. Robert Howlett, Luther Lincoln, Amos Gordon and Stephen Tucker were some of the first settlers in the fall of 1832. Gordon left Wayne County, Michigan to arrive at the mission in Grand Rapids to build the first mill at Indian Mill Creek, later leading a scouting group of Howlett, Lincoln and Tucker in birch canoes down the Grand River in the summer of 1832. The group found Buck Creek emptying into the Grand, determining the creek was strong enough for a mill, with many of Wyoming&#x27;s first settlers establishing themselves near the creek.

Lincoln built the first log shanty in the area in the fall of 1832 and began to prepare his plot with livestock and crops before the winter. Lincoln and Tucker would stay at the mission through the winter; Tucker and Native Americans later constructed the first established house for his family in March 1833. Lincoln&#x27;s cabin, however, was built in close proximity to the Norton Mounds and was likely burned down by Odawa natives according to settler Roswell Britton. The first settlers had a successful harvest, constructing gristmills and sawmills on Buck Creek in a year in 1833 and by April 1834, a community called &quot;Little Prairie&quot; had been established. On May 24, 1834, the first post office was established at Little Prairie. In 1835, competing lumber mills on Buck Creek that supplied wood to Chicago – one owned by Albert and John Bull and the other by Nathanial Brown – starved the water flow to Gordon&#x27;s mill, resulting with Gordon building a new mill on what is now the southwest corner of 44th Street and Burlingame Avenue. Through the 1800s, Wyoming would primarily remain an agricultural location and its development occurred near transportation routes in the region.

===Byron Township (1836–1848)===
The boundaries of Township 5 North, Range 12 West and Township 6 North, Range 12 West, surveyed by Lyon, were consolidated and designated to be organized as Byron Township in 1835 by the Michigan Territorial Legislature. In late 1835, the first wedding occurred between Sylvester Hills and Harriet Burton. The town was first organized as Byron Township on May 2, 1836, was called &quot;Oakesville&quot; as it was headquartered at the home of Charles H. Oakes, though when Oakes moved to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the name was changed to Grandville. It was this year that one of Wyoming&#x27;s most notable pioneers, Justus Charles Rogers, established his homestead on what is now the southwest corner of 28th Street and Clyde Park Avenue. A framed house was constructed by Rogers in the spring of 1836 and was expected to accept his wife upon their return, though the home was discovered destroyed by a tornado in September 1836 when they returned.

The following year in 1837, the launch of the pole boat propelled by a quant, the &quot;Cinderella&quot;, was celebrated as a major development for the town. The first floor of what would become Rogers Mansion was then constructed in 1837, with the second floor being finished in 1839. For three weeks, settlers had to live without flour and late in the year, the first metal casting occurred at the Jame McCray foundry. In 1839, the township&#x27;s final land patents south of the Grand River were issued for plots near the salt springs adjacent to the Norton Mounds and Section 16. Plaster Creek first powered plaster operations in the township in 1841 on land leased by Daniel Ball from De Garmo Jones. In May 1843, Gordon died in Plainfield Township, Michigan.

===Wyoming Township (1848–1959)===
On April 3, 1848, the township of Byron divided in half, with the name of Wyoming being used for the northern portion where the majority of the population was settled, with many settling near Buck Creek. At the time of division, about 500 people lived in Wyoming while a little less than 200 lived in Byron. The name came from the Wyoming County, New York from which the majority of the residents came during the first 16 years. During the Great Famine in Ireland, Irish immigrants began to appear in Wyoming in 1849, with the Whalen family being among the first Irish families in the township. Michael Avenue is named after Michael Whalen. Dutch immigrants arrived in greater numbers and created agricultural cooperatives on smaller parcels of land, creating closed groups among themselves. In 1850, the population of Wyoming Township was counted at 543 people. At the time, Dutch and Irish immigrants were scapegoated for the prevalence of &quot;Michigan ague,&quot; or malaria, which had begun affecting the area.

==== Fisher&#x27;s Station ====

David Fisher arrived in Wyoming in 1857 and acquired land from Gordon&#x27;s estate, replacing Gordon&#x27;s old Buck Creek mill, which had burned down, and built a replacement. Fisher would then construct cabins along the west side of Burlingame Avenue which housed Fisher and the millers he employed. Operations for Fisher would expand further south on Buck Creek where he would extract lime and peat, later building a second mill on a plot of land he purchased from William Ferry in the southeast portion of the township. In 1869 a station on the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad was constructed and in 1870, Fisher had a town platted called &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Station,&quot; which would develop around the railroad station. A post office was constructed in 1871 and the area was platted in December 1873. The population of Wyoming Township grew to 2,008 in 1874 while the population of Fisher&#x27;s Station was 65 in 1888. Fisher, along with his brother and business partner James, would retire in Grand Rapids and lived as wealthy men for the rest of their lives. During the township&#x27;s early history, the then rural community would often produce agricultural goods and travel to Grand Rapids to sell their products.

==== Suburban growth ====
Gypsum mines in northeast Wyoming along Plaster Creek operated for decades and became more refined in 1880 when the Alabastine Company acquired much of the gypsum, later opening the Alabastine Mine in 1907. Wyoming Township began to grow as a suburb of Grand Rapids in 1890 with its next major area of development occurring in the northeast section of the township closest to Grand Rapids with much of the city&#x27;s population moving southward in the early 1900s. The City of Grand Rapids started annexing portions of the township and by 1891 had annexed one square mile () of the city from Division to Clyde Park and from Hall to Burton. In 1902, the Grand Rapids, Holland and Chicago Railway promoted the creation of more plats in the Galewood, Urbandale, and Burlingame (GUB) neighborhoods, with the railway providing transportation to downtown Grand Rapids in fifteen minutes. From 1890 to 1906, thirty-two plats were in the GUB neighborhoods with communities bordering Grand Rapids developing into suburban areas where Dutch Americans predominately resided. In the GUB area, the Christian Reformed Church expanded with its Dutch churchgoers. Another section of Wyoming was annexed by Grand Rapids in 1916 that involved the half-mile from Burton to Alger and from Clyde Park to Division.

The growth of Wyoming saw the emergence of profitable businesses there, including the Leonard Refrigerator Company, the Pierre Marquette railroad car repair shop and gypsum mines. Gravel pits operated by Grand Rapids Gravel Company lined the western side of present-day Byron Center Avenue from 28th Street (then Beales Road) in the south to the north near Lamar Park – its nearby lakes being former pits – also provided jobs and gravel for roads in the expanding township. With the United States entering World War I, the federal government began construction of a picric acid factory on the west side of 44th Street and Clyde Park Avenue, employing thousands of people in the area and attracting others after rumors of an airplane factory on the site were spread, though construction would end following the Armistice of 11 November 1918. In the late 1910s and early 1920s in the GUB neighborhood, Hackett and later Lorraine automobiles were manufactured at a factory on Beverly and Burlingame Avenues.

Into the 1920s, Wyoming saw its population nearly triple, experiencing its period of largest growth, with city officials accustomed to rural affairs being overwhelmed with new developments, taking on tasks and issues as they occurred. Farmers in Wyoming began to sell their farms for development as prices for their produce declined, with farming families either assuming jobs in Grand Rapids or leaving the area. Since Wyoming did not have adequate zoning regulations like neighboring Grand Rapids, land speculators began the platting of small, cheap residential properties, especially the neighborhoods of Godwin Heights, Home Acres, Wyoming Park and along Division Avenue, with plat proposals occurring during every town meeting at the time. Materials from the cancelled picric acid plant were taken and used to construct some of these cheap houses, which had tarpaper roofs and lacked basements. The construction of these affordable home developments in Wyoming provided a cheap workforce for Grand Rapids. Citizens already established in the Grand Rapids and Wyoming area deplored the new residents who moved to the Home Acres and Division corridor, referring to the area as &quot;Shanty Town&quot; and as a place of crime. White Protestants in Wyoming also prevented African Americans from residing in the township, engaging in housing segregation and redlining, with some sales agreements explicitly stating that a property &quot;shall never be occupied by a negro,&quot; extending such agreements to second parties, heirs and others. As a result of suburbanization the population of Wyoming had grown about 200% between 1920 and 1930, from 5,702 to 16,931 and the unorganized zoning of the township would cause issues for Wyoming throughout its future.

With Wyoming developing at such a rapid pace, the Grand Rapids city officials and affiliated business leaders attempted to deter the development of industry in Wyoming, fearing that Grand Rapids would lose skilled workers and wages would increase. One major incident of Grand Rapids preventing industrial development in Wyoming occurred in the early 1920s when Ford Motor Company attempted to purchase the unfinished picric acid factory that was being constructed during World War I. Kendall Furniture quickly purchased the property before Ford could acquire the site, later selling the property to repay back taxes.

==== Great Depression and General Motors ====
As the Great Depression affected the world&#x27;s economy in the 1930s, Grand Rapids saw little industrial development as there was no demand for luxury furniture, the city&#x27;s main economic product. During the economic depression, the cheap furniture laborers residing in Wyoming were laid off and at least twenty-five percent of citizens were unemployed. Wyoming teachers took a 45% pay cut and children had to share textbooks in school. A poor fund was established in 1931, though by September 1932, the $44,000 collected – the – was insufficient for the project. Small construction projects by the Township provided some funds for residents, though they were only temporary measures, with tax deadline extensions from the Township becoming common throughout the Great Depression as individuals could not afford to pay taxes. By mid-1933, about 20% of Wyoming&#x27;s workforce was unemployed.

During the depression, many residents of Wyoming grew disillusioned with the existing unchecked capitalism, small government practices and the laissez-faire economic system that relied on local governments, churches, and charities to provide the care for citizens. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the New Deal and federal social welfare programs – including the Civil Works Administration, Public Works Administration, and Federal Emergency Relief Administration to the United States, city residents strongly approved of these actions by his government. It was reported that men in Wyoming were grateful and wept when they were told that they would have a job for the first time in years as a result of Roosevelt&#x27;s welfare programs. Roosevelt&#x27;s program helped Wyoming pay workers to construct new bridges, parks, roads, schools, and sewers; with Ideal Park, Johnson Park, and the first township office being constructed with federal funding.

Former Mayor of Grand Rapids George P. Tilma was elected supervisor of Wyoming Township in 1932 and was tasked with modernizing the developing suburban community from a rural town system. In 1933, Grandville was separated from Wyoming and was established as its own city. In the winter of 1933, Tilma was also able to circumvent the Emergency Banking Act in a technicality to purchase 555 tons of coal that was distributed to the poor to heat their homes. General Motors sought to construct a new facility in Grand Rapids, though there were no areas for development or future expansions, so the cities of Grand Rapids and Wyoming collaborated to have General Motors purchase land in Wyoming while Grand Rapids supplied utilities to the site. Tilma&#x27;s expertise was instrumental in both secretly negotiating with Grand Rapids on utility work and with obtaining approval of the site by General Motors. The General Motors plant began construction on January 22, 1936, and Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal funding helped construct the sewer and water system for the factory. The first enrollment date for employees on April 6, 1936, saw a line of workers spanning nearly from the factory&#x27;s entrance west of Buchanan Avenue and 36th Street, east to Division Avenue and then north to 28th Street, with the first metal stamps being shipped from the factory on June 1, 1936.

Following the construction of the General Motors stamping plant, development on Division Avenue increased extensively, with a new Kelloggsville High School being opened in September 1936 and a new Godwin Heights High School being approved in January 1937. Supervisor Tilma died suddenly in his office in April 1937 with his death being attributed to an intracerebral hemorrhage. As World War II began, Reynolds Metals opened a plant in the township that was initially to develop airplane material in 1942.

==== Post-war growth, push towards cityhood ====
Following World War II, Wyoming developed so rapidly that mobile homes began to appear on vacant properties throughout the city, with an ordinance being passed in 1947 to prevent this. In 1946, General Motors Diesel Equipment Division, which was later known as Delphi Automotive and today known as GM Components Holdings, began operations in an area of that was former swampland which was drained for a muck farm.

As Wyoming moved towards cityhood, the Township purchased of land from Judy Devine in December 1947 on the northeast corner of 28th Street and DeHoop Avenue, establishing the area known as the town center of Wyoming due to the increased development on 28th Street. A year later in 1948, Lake Alexander was drained and converted into what is now Jackson Park. In May 1948, a committee was created by the Township which recommended incorporating Wyoming into a city. As Wyoming pursued incorporation, Grand Rapids increased annexation attempts, with the annexation of GUB being defeated in April 1949.

The 1950s was the decade of Wyoming&#x27;s fastest development, with homes developing so quickly that the Township experienced difficulties providing proper utilities to homes. Multiple wells were drilled throughout the area to provide water to the developing community after the water supply from Grand Rapids was discontinued, temporarily sparking political controversy surrounding water supplies. The Township board approved a route for U.S. Route 131 through Wyoming in July 1952 and 28th Street was widened from two to four lanes shortly after. In August 1956, a vote for incorporation into a city was narrowly defeated and the Ivanrest area was annexed by Grandville. Rogers Department Store, one of the largest department stores in Michigan at the time, opened on 28th Street in 1955. On November 6, 1958, voters approved the incorporation of Wyoming into a city.

===City of Wyoming (1959–present)===

==== Entertainment and retail destination ====
In the 1960s, the city was able to launch several projects. The first was a sewage plant to take care of issues from the state in regards to dumping it in the Buck Creek and Grand River. The next was the completion of the Water Plant in Holland with a pipeline to the city.

New developments occurred over the decade on 28th Street, with free vehicle parking drawing some shoppers away from Grand Rapids. One major project was Rogers Plaza, which opened in August 1961 as the first indoor shopping mall in Michigan and one of the first in the United States, including stores such as S. S. Kresge, W. T. Grant, Kroger, A&amp;P, Cunningham Drug, and Montgomery Ward. The neighboring Wyoming Village Mall opened later in 1961 and was anchored by Wurzburg&#x27;s. Fruitbasket Flowerland also opened in 1961 providing lawn care tools, flowers, and outdoor furniture for the developing suburban homes. Gordon Food Service moved from Grand Rapids to Wyoming in 1962. Three annexation attempts by Grand Rapids were also defeated in that year: the Kent County Airport, the Blackburn neighborhood, and the Buchanan neighborhood.

Studio 28 opened on the 28th Street corridor in 1965 and expanded in size over decades into the world&#x27;s first multiplex and the largest multiplex in the world in 1988. In July 1966, the Lake Michigan pipeline to Wyoming began to supply water to the city, a major accomplishment after years of difficulties with low-quality wells. By the end of the decade, the city faced fund shortages and multiple income tax proposals were turned down. Wyoming began to establish many municipal facilities in the 1970s, including a public works building, a centralized fire station, a combined police-justice building, and a new public library. By the 1980s, the city became concerned about the quality of developments, with adult bookstores and massage parlors appearing. In 1990, Reynolds Metals closed their operations in the city.

==== Great Recession and redevelopment ====
After over a decade of negotiations with the City of Grandville, including a promise by the developer to not build into Wyoming, Rivertown Crossings Mall opened in 1999 near the southwest border of Wyoming, causing many commercial tenants to leave the 28th Street corridor. In response, Wyoming unveiled a redevelopment plan for their city center that they hoped would revitalize businesses on the 28th Street corridor. For Rogers Plaza, the exterior was remodel and the former Montgomery Ward anchor store was demolished and replaced with a Family Fare supermarket. A street was also planned to stretch from Rogers Plaza across Michael Avenue to Wyoming Village Mall and further down to Studio 28, with commercial and apartment developments anticipated. The owners of Wyoming Village Mall ultimately disagreed with plans to tear down a portion of their building to develop the street.

In October 2003, the Delphi Automotive plant on Burlingame Avenue and Burton Street notified neighbors in the area that vinyl chloride had spread to the groundwater about to the north following the plant&#x27;s use of trichloroethylene as a degreaser, with traces of the chemical detected since the 1980s. The once-popular Rogers Department Store closed in 2003. More business was lost in the late-2000s into the 2010s during the great recession, with the GM Fisher Body Plant closing in 2009 due to budget cuts by General Motors. Much of the commercial atmosphere of 28th Street also dwindled, with Studio 28 closing in 2008 and vacancy rates up to nearly 40% in 2011.

In the mid-2010s, development spread to southern Wyoming. Gordon Foods expanded its headquarters in 2012 and development occurred near the recently built Metro Health Hospital. The 28 West plan was also initiated to make 28th Street a more pedestrian-friendly corridor while also centralizing the development of food, retail, and entertainment projects in the city&#x27;s center, effectively creating a downtown area. 28 West Place Street, a street similar to Wyoming&#x27;s 2002 proposal, was approved by the City and Wyoming Mall&#x27;s owners in 2016, opening to the public in October 2017. In 2019, Magnus Capital Partners was approved to construct apartments, named HōM Flats at 28 West, with the first residents moving into their homes in early 2020.

In 2022, Franklin Partners purchased the former land of the General Motors plant, known as Site 36, from the City of Wyoming for $5.25 million and started development discussions with four local companies and a few entities based outside of Michigan.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.88%) is water.

The city is situated southwest of Grand Rapids and south of the Grand River. Buck Creek spans the city and created a valley of dark loam soil that was used historically for farming, while elevated land above the valley is dense clay soil. In the northern area of Wyoming just south of the Grand River, pockets of gravel and gypsum also exist. Some areas in Wyoming had caverns and sinkholes in the past, possibly created by water pockets eroding limestone and sandstone, though most of these features have likely collapsed due to their instability.

===Major highways===
* runs along the northwestern edge of the city.
* passes briefly through the northwest corner of the city.
* runs north–south through the center of the city. 
* runs along a small portion of the southern edge of the city.
* runs west–east through the center of the city.

===Climate===
==Economy==
As of the 2000 census, there are presently 10 types of industries in the city. Manufacturing accounts for 30%, retail 16%, education, health, and social services 15%, with the next five industries accounting for 6%, and transportation, warehousing, utilities accounting for 3% of business in the city. The manufacturing segment is unique in that it is the largest in West Michigan. It currently produces auto parts, industrial machinery, commercial printing, plastics, food processing, electronics, tool and dies, concrete supplies, and fire engines.

After Grandville allowed development of a new 6-anchor shopping complex, Rivertown Crossings Mall, and the related development, many major retail businesses in Wyoming folded, including the long-standing Roger&#x27;s Department Store, its successor, and most tenants of Rogers Plaza. The city of Wyoming formed a Downtown Development Authority in an effort to help support the city in keeping businesses in the area in 1999.

In the 2000s, plans were being made to revitalize the 28th Street corridor. In 2013, the City of Wyoming introduced the 28 West plan, a plan to develop downtown Wyoming along 28th Street into a more pedestrian friendly environment that will provide food, retail, and entertainment. In June 2016, plans began moving forward on the 28 West plan with the demolition of part of the Wyoming Village Mall and the creation of a new road through the surrounding parking lots to attract developers.

===Largest employers===

According to the city&#x27;s 2021 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:

==Arts and culture==

The city has 21 parks that cover about which offer a multitude of activities. The parks department has been active in the past decade in redeveloping the parks in the city. Many parks have been rebuilt which included adding new equipment, splash pads, and facilities. They have also added a few new facilities such as a small skateboard park near one of the highest density areas of the city. The city also offers a Senior Center that provides activities for the older citizens of the city and the surrounding region. Along with the parks is the Kent Trails system that converted abandoned rail lines to bike paths. It is a collaborative effort between multiple local governments. The most recent addition to the Wyoming Park System is the Dog Park located next to Marquette Park at the very northern edge of the city. It is a privately funded park with access controls to restrict usage to registered members.

In 2002, the new Wyoming Public Library was built and is owned by the city but run by the Kent District Library System. It is a facility with over 112,046 items. The library branch is also the highest attended in the Kent District system with 670,842 items checked out and 439,599 visits in 2009. The library currently has around 76% of the population holding a card to use the facility. The building houses the Wyoming Historical Commission that holds historical materials of the city. Along with Historical Commission room, it houses the library for the blind and an art gallery.

Starting in 2005, the Wyoming-Kentwood Chamber of Commerce put together the 28th Street Metro Cruise that draws in automobile enthusiasts from the region. It currently spans from its start in Grandville at Wilson and 28th where drivers gather and drive to the cruise&#x27;s end in Cascade Township. The cruise runs on Friday and Saturday on the last weekend of August.

=== Religion ===

Christian Reformed Dutch settlers established the first churches in Wyoming, with Grandville Avenue Christian Reformed Church being founded in 1891, which is now part of The Potter&#x27;s House school. Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church was built in 1908, serving as the place of worship for Roman Catholics in Wyoming. The Episcopal population established the Holy Trinity Episcopal Church at the site of a former chicken coop in 1957. The Assemblies of God established a church in 1929 and moved to their current location on 44th Street in 1977, with the facility being able to seat 1,400 people.

The city has a council-manager government with both an elected mayor and an appointed city manager. Currently, Kent Vanderwood serves as Wyoming&#x27;s mayor after defeating Sam Bolt and Cliff Tompkins in the 2022 election. The city council is composed of six members: three at-large and a representative from each of the three wards. The current council members are: Sheldon DeKryger, Renee Hill, Robert Arnoys, Vacant (1st Ward), Marissa Postler (2nd Ward), and Rob Postema (3rd Ward/Mayor Pro-Tem). Meetings are held at the City Hall on the first and third Mondays of every month. Work sessions are held the second Monday of each month.

=== Politics ===
The first documentation of political parties in Wyoming was during the 1894 United States elections, with the majority of votes in the city supporting the Republican Party. Wyoming used a caucus election system that was frequently plagued with ballot stuffing until the Township switched to a primary election system in 1928. Republican support was strong in Wyoming until the Great Depression when Democratic Party candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected President of the United States in the 1932 United States presidential election. Prior to this, only Republican candidates would run for office in Wyoming, though in 1933 elections, members of the Communist Party USA and Democrats entered as candidates, with one Democrat being elected into local office. The Communist Party would make its last run for local office in 1935. In 1937, voters in then Wyoming Township elected its first Democratic supervisor, Herman Wierenga. In Wyoming&#x27;s 1954 elections, citizens voted Democrats into every office, with the Democratic Party maintaining a strong position in the city since then.

Following the 2020 United States presidential election, MLive reported in 2022 that mayor-elect Kent Vanderwood was included among a Michigan contingent of Republicans allegedly involved in the Trump fake electors plot, reportedly organized as one of the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election in favor of incumbent President Donald Trump. In January 2023, former member of the Michigan House of Representatives, Tommy Brann, was appointed by the city council to be council-member-at-large. On July 18, 2023, Mayor Kent Vanderwood, along with 15 other people statewide, was indicted by the Michigan Attorney General for his role in the 2020 fake electors plot.

===Public safety===

On September 30, 2007, Metro Health Hospital moved from southeast Grand Rapids to its current location on the south central section of Wyoming. Spectrum Health and St. Mary&#x27;s also have urgent care centers located in Wyoming with their hospitals located in downtown Grand Rapids.

The Wyoming Police Department has over eighty sworn police officers serving as of 2013. In 2014, Wyoming Police Department and Wyoming Fire Department amalgamated their administrative offices into the Police Headquarters building, creating the new entity of Wyoming Department of Public Safety.

==Education==

Currently the city is served by 8 school districts. The southwest panhandle is served by Grandville Public Schools, the south extension of the city near Metro Health is served by Byron Center Public Schools, the central part is served by Wyoming Public Schools, the southeast is served by Kelloggsville Public Schools, the area south of 56th St and east of the railroad tracks is served by Kentwood Public Schools, a small annexed section near Hall St and Freeman Avenue is served by Grand Rapids Public Schools, the northeast is served by Godwin Heights Public Schools, and finally the northern section of the city is served by Godfrey-Lee Public Schools.

Of the eight districts only four do not have the majority of the buildings in the city. Grand Rapids Public Schools, Kentwood Public Schools and Byron Center Public Schools do not have any schools in the City of Wyoming; Grandville Public Schools has most of its schools outside of the Wyoming city limits. The remaining four districts do have many schools in the Wyoming city limits: 13 elementary schools, 3 out of 13 middle schools, 4 out of 8 high schools, with Godfrey-Lee having a combination middle high school located in the city.

The Potter&#x27;s House, a Christian K-12 school, maintains its high school campus in Wyoming. Holy Trinity Lutheran School is a Pre-K-8 grade school of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod in Wyoming. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand Rapids has two K-8 schools, St John Vianney School and San Juan Diego Academy.

For higher education the city is served by Grand Rapids Community College in downtown Grand Rapids. In Allendale, northwest of the city, there is Grand Valley State University. Further universities can be found in Lansing, Big Rapids, and Kalamazoo. Also located in the immediate area is Hope College in Holland, Davenport University in Caledonia Township, Calvin College on the east side of Grand Rapids, Aquinas College also on the east side of Grand Rapids, Cornerstone University on the northeast side of Grand Rapids, along with Grace Bible College. The Protestant Reformed Theological Seminary is located in 4949 West Ivanrest Ave Wyoming, Michigan.

==Infrastructure==
===Public transit===
The city is part of the Grand Rapids-based Interurban Transit Partnership, called The Rapid. It currently runs Routes 1, 3, 8, 10, 16, 24, 28, and 44 in the city of Wyoming; that is 8 out of the system&#x27;s 26 routes. Currently the U.S. Department of Transportation is funding a good portion of a new transit system for the area. It will run along Division Avenue on the east side of the city from its southernmost point to the downtown. It is a bus rapid transit system with only 5 projected stations on the route inside of the city. The new line will be run by The Rapid. 

===Utilities===
Currently the city provides water and sewer to the majority of the citizens. Electricity is supplied by Consumers Energy with natural gas nominally supplied by DTE Energy. Garbage service is supplied by individual contractors to homeowners and by law they are required to use the county incinerator, although the city does provide a yard waste drop off center. For both phone and cable, service is supported by both AT&amp;T and Comcast. Cell phone carriers are on the whole fully supported with a number of towers.

<doc id="117866" wikidata="Q2428628" url="?curid=117866" title="Ahmeek, Michigan">
<text>Ahmeek is a village in Keweenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The village is located within Allouez Township. The population was 127 at the 2020 census. At , it is the smallest municipality in Michigan by land area, and is the only incorporated municipality in Keweenaw County.

== History ==
The name Ahmeek is derived from the Ojibwe (Chippewa) language. The village takes its name from the Ojibwe word, &quot;amik&quot;, which means &quot;Beaver&quot;, and it was named so because of an abundance of beavers in the vicinity of the present-day village.

The Ahmeek Mine was the most successful mine along the Kearsarge Amygdaloid Lode, which spans through Houghton and Keweenaw Counties, as well as the most profitable, and the largest producer along the lode. The Ahmeek Mine&#x27;s Shafts No. 3 &amp; 4 were also one of the most distinctive in all of the Copper Country.

===Early days and founding===
Mining itself in the community began around the year 1880 as the Ahmeek Mining Company began as an exploratory branch of the already-existing Seneca Mining Company to work the copper-rich Kearsarge Amygdaloid Lode. The Ahmeek Mining Company formally opened in 1903, thus becoming its own separate entity apart from the Seneca, however operations of the Ahmeek Mine under the newly independent company initially began in the year 1902. The local area grew because of its location on the Mineral Range Railroad. In 1908, the construction of the Ahmeek Mining Company Office was completed, as designed by the architect Paul Macneil. The Village of Ahmeek was founded by Joseph Bosch, the creator of the Bosch Brewing Company, in 1904. Attorney James A. Hamilton became the first postmaster of Ahmeek on February 5, 1909, the same year in which it was incorporated as a village. The village was plotted by two real estate agents from Calumet by the names of Faucett and Gunk. The two agents divided the property into lots and then sold them piece by piece. As of the year of the village&#x27;s incorporation, Maurice Kenel served as the first village President of Ahmeek, having been elected March 15, 1909. The village firehall was built several years later in 1911 at a total sum of $2,925 dollars. The local Calvary Cemetery, which is also known as the Ahmeek Cemetery, was created a year later in 1912.

===Industrialization===
Ahmeek served as a critical stop for several transportation services, mostly around the early 20th century. It served as a depot on the Mineral Range Railroad and the Copper Range Railroad and also had a streetcar station for the Houghton County Traction Company, which ran south from Houghton up to Ahmeek, and on north towards Mohawk. The Streetcar Station was completed in the year 1909 and operated under the Houghton County Traction Company until the year 1932, when it served other purposes, such as a bus stop.

===Copper Country Strike of 1913–1914===
During the watershed moment that was the great Copper Country Strike of 1913–14, Ahmeek was the scene of regular tension and division in the Keweenaw, a key instance being on or about October 6, 1913, when Guy Wilkins, a clerk at the Ahmeek Mine supply office, was assaulted and shot after being confronted by a rogue mob. The strike was the culmination of extensive labour unrest in the area, fueled in large part by unethical treatment by mining companies. The strike brought the once-tranquil and calm Copper Country to violence, from which it would ultimately not recover. Ahmeek, in particular, saw striking miners fire upon a trainload of hired professional strikebreakers engaged by the mining companies, as well as the detonation of an Ahmeek Mine smokestack. Despite local officials&#x27; complaints about the lack of law and order, Judge Patrick Henry O&#x27;Brien, who presided over cases related to the violence, ruled that while the strikers were, indeed, in violation of the law, the mining companies themselves had hardly done anything to lessen the tension and had, instead, acted in ways only increasing &quot;the bitterness and hostility&quot; of the situation.

===Later years===

The Ahmeek Mining Company continued to work the Kearsarge lode through the Ahmeek Mine until the year 1923, when the mining company was incorporated into the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company. Operations of the site under the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company ceased in 1931 under effects of the Great Depression. After the Depression had concluded, the Ahmeek Mine reopened in the year 1936 and carried on until around 1966 when the mine closed permanently. On April 30, 1971, Gabriel J. Chopp, retired after thirty-nine years serving as Ahmeek&#x27;s postmaster, thus making him the longest-serving postmaster of the village of Ahmeek, the only incorporated settlement in Keweenaw County.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , or 42.52 acres, all land.

==Services==
Baldwin is served by the Baldwin Community Schools school district, including Baldwin High School. A &quot;Baldwin Promise&quot; promises funding for college education in Michigan of all Baldwin High School graduates.

==Attractions==
Baldwin is primarily a tourist town. As such, much of its economy is based around the summer months. Lake County sports many lakes and rivers, as well as the vast wilderness of the Manistee National Forest. Many come to Baldwin on vacation to camp, canoe, fish, or hunt.

The Shrine of the Pines is a noted tourist attraction.
The nearby Pere Marquette River is one of America&#x27;s Blue Ribbon fisheries and sportfishing is a major contributor to the local economy.

The nearby Baldwin River, a tributary of the Pere Marquette River, is the site of the first planting of German Brown Trout in the United States on April 11, 1884.

Baldwin is home of the world&#x27;s largest trout statue. Located downtown Baldwin, the trout stands 25 feet tall. The village and Lake County take pride in this structure. 
==Private prison==
The North Lake Correctional Facility is a private, for-profit, maximum security prison that was constructed in the late 1990s in Baldwin by the Wackenhut Corrections Co. (now the GEO Group). The prison was originally built to house Michigan&#x27;s youth offenders, but the state withdrew its charges from the facility. The GEO group expanded the prison from 500 to 1,700 beds; by 2005 it was vacant. For a brief time it housed some inmates from California in 2011 but was soon closed again.

In June 2015, GEO Group contracted for two years with the state of Vermont to house 280 high-security inmates convicted of crimes in the state of Vermont in the North Lake Correctional Facility. It was far from home; many had previously been housed in private prison facilities in Kentucky and Arizona.

This contract was facilitated by the state legislature enacting a bill to support the private prison, specifically to authorize incarceration of high-security inmates at this facility. Lake Country Republican Rep. Jon Bumstead had sponsored a bill in the Michigan Legislature to raise the security rating of the North Lake facility to Michigan&#x27;s highest in order to accomplish this. The Michigan Senate voted 23–14 to remove the former restrictive provision, making it legal for the GEO Group to house out-of-state prisoners of all security classifications in Baldwin.

As Lake County has high poverty and unemployment rates, legislators thought the expanded prison could provide some jobs to local residents. County Commissioner Dan Sloan stated that as many as 150 jobs would result from the transfer of out-of-state prisoners to the facility. In December 2016 GEO Group told Vermont that it would not renew its contract with the state in June 2017; some 256 long-term prisoners from Vermont are being held at this prison.

In May 2019, GEO announced that it obtained a contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons to house illegal immigrants that were convicted of crimes while illegally in the US. On October 1, 2019, the prison officially started to accept these prisoners. It was again closed in September 2022.

<text>Columbiaville is a village in Lapeer County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 702 at the 2020 census. Located along the Flint River, the village is mostly within Marathon Township with a small portion extending south into Oregon Township. 

==History==
The first settler on the site of the village was Levi D. Cutting, a carpenter and cabinet maker by trade, who arrived with his family in 1847. His home in Columbiaville is still standing at the south corner of Water and Lapeer Streets. In 1848, George and Henry Niver built a saw mill on the banks of the Flint River and the place became known as &quot;Niverville&quot;. William Peter, a neighbor of the Nivers from their previous residence in Columbia County, New York came to work in the Niver&#x27;s sawmill. By 1852, he opened his own business, starting with a store. He eventually came into possession of the entire property of Columbiaville.

A post office was established in April 1857 with the name &quot;Columbiaville&quot;. The Nivers originally suggested the name &quot;Columbia&quot; after their home county in New York, but at the time there was already another post office in Michigan with that name.

The village continued to grow with the inclusion of a large Steam Grist and Flouring Mill, built by William Peter. The Detroit and Bay City Railroad chose to route through Columbiaville and was opened to the public in 1872. The first depot was a wooden structure located on the east side of the track at Pine Street. In 1893 the brick depot was erected by William Peter, with the provision in the deed that all passenger trains were to stop in Columbiaville. The railroad provided great means of transportation and opportunity for the village. In 1892 the Peters along with Toledo workmen, built the William Peter Mansion. They moved into the sixteen room Mansion in 1896. Mrs. Peter stated that the location of the home was chosen for convenience of being right downtown in the center of activity. Peter soon after became ill and died on October 23, 1899, at age 75. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery. The first automobile traveled into the village in 1903, and was not initially well accepted by all residents who were in fear of witch craft. The first gas station in the village was established in the early 1900s by Standard Oil Company. Early automobile dealers were Roy Osborne, who built a large garage and dealership display on Water Street in 1920. Thomas Ward established Willey&#x27;s Overland Garage in the 1920s.

<text>Imlay City is a city in Lapeer County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,707 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1836, Connecticut businessman William H. Imlay began purchases areas of the forest here, and when the township was organized in 1850, it was named after him. In 1870, the Port Huron &amp; Lake Michigan Railroad began building rail lines through the area, and chief engineer Charles Palmer purchased land in order to build a market and hotel. A post office began operating here on December 12, 1870 with Edward Palmer serving as the first postmaster. The community grew quickly to include 15 stores, a grain elevator, and several mills. In 1871, the community incorporated as a village named Imlay City.

In 1914, the city started building streetcar lines—a form of public transportation that was usually reserved for large cities. In April 1970, Imlay City celebrated its 100th birthday, and the residents voted to change Imlay City from a village to a home rule city by a two to one margin. The construction of Interstate 69 in the 1980s connected Imlay City with Flint, Port Huron, and Canada, leading to significant economic growth to serve the interstate travelers.

== Economy ==
Michigan-born Vlasic Pickles has long history in Imlay City.

Founded by Croatian immigrant Franjo Vlasic in 1920s, the Vlasic Company began as a creamery in Detroit that eventually grew to be the state’s largest wholesale milk distributorship. As the company grew, it added hams and pickles for the city’s polish community.

The Vlasics produced pickles in barrels, as had been the standard for centuries. In 1942 Franjo’s son, Joseph, and grandson, Bob, began packing pickles in glass jars and the demand for pickles began to take off.

To keep up with demand, in 1957 Joseph Vlasic bought an existing pickle plant on Blacks Corners Road in Imlay City, Michigan, and two years later the Vlasic pickle empire was born when he founded Vlasic Foods.

Still a vital part of the Imlay City community, Vlasic maintains a presence in the state as well. The cucumbers used in Vlasic pickles are grown in Michigan, in the cities of Mount Pleasant and Kalamazoo.

==Education==
Imlay City has five public schools, which are all part of Imlay City Community Schools, and one private school. The public schools include Weston Elementary for Kindergarten through 2nd grade, Borland Elementary for 3rd through 5th grade, Imlay City Middle School for 6th grade through 8th grade, and Imlay City High School for 9th through 12th grade. There is also Venture High School, an alternative school for students who do not succeed at the traditional high school. The private school in Imlay City is the Imlay City Christian School, which is a non-denominational, private Christian school located just outside town; it was established in 1952 by parents of the local area.

===Library===
The Ruth Hughes Memorial District Library was first opened on January 27, 1990. It was constructed on the funds Ruth E. Hughes left for the Township Library through her will upon her death in March 1985. The library is governed by a seven-member board of trustees, with representation from Imlay City, Imlay Township and Attica Township.

===Museum===
The Imlay City Historical Museum was established in 1978 and is run by a private, non-profit organization. While its historical records primarily showcase Imlay City, Imlay Township, Attica Township, Arcadia Township, Goodland Township and the surrounding areas, it also has had such items as a World War I handgun exhibit. In front of its building is an historical caboose that was decommissioned some time ago. The building was a train station for the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, until the Imlay City Historical Commission wanted to lease the building from Grand Trunk Western after they decided to bulldoze it in 1971. Grand Trunk Western decided to lease the land to Imlay City, and from Imlay City, the Historical Commission leased the building for a museum. Work was started on restoring the building, and in 1978 it was completed. The open house ceremony and dedication was held on November 9, 1979.

==Geography==

<text>Lapeer ( &quot;&quot;) is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan and is the county seat of Lapeer County. As of the 2020 census, the city population was . Most of the city was incorporated from land that was formerly in Lapeer Township, though portions were also annexed from Mayfield Township and Elba Township. Lapeer is in southern Michigan, east of Flint, on the Flint River.

==History==

By an ordinance of the Congress of the United States passed on July 13, 1787, the area lying northwest of the Ohio River, though still occupied by the British, was organized as the Northwest Territory. Lapeer County was once part of the Northwest Territory. In January 1820, the county of Oakland was formed, which served the area now known as Lapeer, until the County of Lapeer was formed in 1837, when Michigan became a state. The first elections were for county officers, with 520 persons voting in 1837.

Folklore claims Lapeer was derived from the naming of the south branch of the Flint River, which flows northwestward in Lapeer County. French and Indian traders frequently passed over this section of the county and through the river, ultimately naming the city for the stone that lay at the river bottom. In French, stone is called &quot;la pierre&quot;; the English pronunciation of these words gives Lapeer. The river was named Flint, synonymous with stone. (See List of Michigan county name etymologies.)

It is also believed that the first settlers who came from New York State may have brought the name Lapeer from a similarly named city in their home state. A third supposition is that French missionaries named the city Le Pere, meaning The Father.

The first settlers in Lapeer were a group of men named Alvin N. Hart, Oliver B. Hart, and J.B. Morse. The most prominent of the three, Alvin N. Hart, was born in Cornwall, Connecticut, on February 11, 1804. He came to Lapeer in 1831 and platted the Village of Lapeer, November 8, 1833. The plat was registered in Pontiac on December 14, 1833, in the County of Oakland; four years before Michigan became a state and Lapeer became a county. Alvin N. Hart became a State Senator in 1843, representing Lapeer, Oakland, Genesee, Shiawassee, Tuscola, Saginaw Counties and the entire Upper Peninsula. He was instrumental in having the State Capitol relocated from Detroit to Lansing. Hart died on August 22, 1874, and is buried in Lapeer.

The second group of settlers were Enoch J. White and his family. He was born in South Hadley, Massachusetts in 1814. He came to Lapeer in 1833. Of pioneer stock, Alvin N. Hart and Enoch J. White both had the initiative to start new communities. Mr. Hart formed Lapeer and Mr. White formed what was then known as Whitesville, which now consists of the western portion of Lapeer. A tamarack swamp once separated these two settlements.

Other distinguished natives include John T. Rich, former governor of the state of Michigan; Louis C. Cramton, special assistant to the U.S. Secretary of the Interior in 1931 and 1932. He led studies of the area around the Colorado River that led to the establishment of the first National Recreation Area, Lake Mead National Recreation Area; Charles Potter, whose son became a U.S. Senator; William Reed, Big Ten Football Commissioner; and Marguerite deAngeli, internationally known writer of children&#x27;s books.

At one time, there were two courthouses. The White family erected one at the present site of the Old Lapeer High School at Main and Genesee Streets, while the Hart family erected one at Nepessing and Court Streets. The Board of Supervisors purchased the Hart courthouse for $3,000, which is now the oldest continuously running courthouse in the state of Michigan and one of the oldest 10 courthouses in the United States. White&#x27;s courthouse later became the first school in Lapeer called Lapeer Academy.

Over time, it became evident that the business district would be near the Courthouse, so the city&#x27;s founders moved the Opera House piece-by-piece to its present location at the southeast corner of Court and Nepessing Streets in 1879. The building is now known as the White Block.

Lapeer&#x27;s first church was the Congregational Church; organized in 1833, the same year Lapeer was platted. The Methodist Episcopal Church opened its doors a year later, followed by the Baptist Church in 1858, the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in 1866, the Universalist Church in 1873, the Methodist Protestant Church in 1877 and the Grace Episcopal Church in 1882.

Lumbering was the sole industry in the early days of Lapeer. The flourishing lumber business attracted the New York Central Railroad and Grand Trunk Railroad. Lapeer later became the intersection to two state trunk lines: M-21 and M-24. Industries today supply the automotive industry with gray iron casting, molded plastics, plastic fabrics, electrical harnesses and stamping.

On October 26, 2010, Lapeer became a founding member of the Karegnondi Water Authority.

On August 15, 2012, the fourth-largest Powerball jackpot was won from a ticket sold at a Sunoco station in Lapeer. The jackpot had an annuity value of $337 million.

<text>Mayfield Township is a civil township of Lapeer County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 7,988 at the 2020 Census.

==History==
Mayfield Township was first organized in 1843 when John B. Evans, John Ryan and Martin Stiles gave notice to the township&#x27;s inhabitants that a town meeting would be held on April 17 at the school near Stiles&#x27; home. 34 freeholders met that day, elected the township&#x27;s first officers, and voted to raise $125 to pay expenses and establish a burial ground. The cemetery was later named after Stiles.

Six years after it was organized, Mayfield Township was attached to Lapeer Township in a move by the state legislature. That arrangement continued until March 13, 1869, when the township was reorganized.

In the years following, the lumber industry grew and by 1874, there were ten saw mills operating in Mayfield Township. The success of the lumber industry resulted in three thriving villages within the township: Fish Lake, Five Lakes and Millville. As land was cleared of its trees, it was sold to individuals for homesteads and farms. By 1884, the village of Fish Lake was abandoned. The census of that year reported no saw, shingle, or lathe mills still operating.

Much of the formerly prime lumbering lands in the township were bought by the Michigan Department of Conservation in 1944. The Michigan State Game Area comprises much of the land once owned by Mayfield Township&#x27;s early settlers.

Besides the mills at Millville, the township&#x27;s longest running business may have been the Callis brick making plant. William Callis moved to Mayfield in the mid-1850s. The plant on the family homestead was built about that time and operated for many years. The home Callis built for his son, William Elmer, at the corner of Callis and Davis Lake Roads still stands.

Mayfield Township has also been home to two of the most successful manufacturing businesses in Lapeer County&#x27;s history. In 1962, Vesely&#x27;s Apache camping trailer was named Michigan&#x27;s Consumer Product of the Year. At one time, the plant was the world&#x27;s largest camping trailer factory, producing up to 2,000 per month. Next, the plant was home to Durakon Industries, which manufactured pickup truck bedliners.

Two historical sites in the township recognized with special markers from the Lapeer County Historical Society are the former villages of Millville and Fish Lake.

<text>Empire is a village on Lake Michigan in the northwestern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. Located in southwestern Leelanau County, its population was 362 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Empire Township, and is famous for its proximity to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Empire is home to the lakeshore&#x27;s headquarters, the Philip A. Hart Visitor Center.

==History==

Empire was founded in 1851. It was incorporated as a village in 1895 with E. R. Dailey, the head of the Empire Lumber Company which was the main employer here, as the first president of the village. The city was named after the schooner &quot;Empire&quot;, which was icebound in the city during a storm in 1865.

The Empire Lumber Company operated from 1887 to 1917, dominating this once booming lumber town. George Aylsworth operated the first mill between 1873 and 1883. Potter and Struthers built a second mill in 1885, which T. Wilce Company purchased in 1887. Called the Empire Lumber Company, it expanded to one of the largest and best equipped hardwood mills in the area, capable of producing up to 20 million feet of lumber a year. Docks, several businesses, and a railroad sprang up in Empire. Destroyed by fire in 1906, the mill was quickly rebuilt. The mill burned again in 1917. With most of the nearby virgin timber gone, the mill was not replaced.

The local Robert H. Manning Memorial Light was built in 1991 by O&#x27;Brien Brothers Construction as a memorial to Robert H. Manning, a lifelong resident of Empire and avid fisherman. Additionally, the beach has an antique anchor which was discovered by Douglas Manning, son of Robert H. Manning, and Michelle Stryker in 1977. Every year, the village of Empire celebrates the raising of the anchor on the third Saturday in July.

==Geography==
Situated approximately due west of Traverse City, Empire is located in the center of the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The Empire Bluffs lie to the south and the sand dunes of the National Lakeshore lie to the north, the area has views of the dunes, North Manitou and South Manitou islands, and Lake Michigan. Most Sleeping Bear Dunes panoramas portrayed on postcards are taken from a walking trail which runs to the top of the Empire Bluffs. A wide beach separates Lake Michigan from its close neighbor, South Bar Lake. The much smaller South Bar Lake stays considerably warmer than the big lake during the summer months.

The small village of Empire is located up a short hill, just a few minutes walk from the beach.

<text>Glen Arbor Township is a civil township of Leelanau County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 757 at the 2020 census. However, the population of the town expands rapidly during the summer months as a result of it being a summer colony.

The community of Glen Arbor, which is considered a census-designated place for statistical purposes, is located in the township. South Manitou Island is politically part of the township.

==History==
John LaRue moved from South Manitou Island to the area of the Sleeping Bear Bay that would eventually become the town in 1848. After establishing a trading post, subsequent settlers began to move to the area with one, Mrs. John E. Fisher, giving the town the name &quot;Glen Arbor&quot; in 1854. Other prominent settlers were John Dorsey, who set up a cooper shop, and C.C. McCarty, who built the Sleeping Bear Inn, originally as a residence for lumbermen. Additionally, George Ray built a dock in 1856 and became the settlement&#x27;s first postmaster and W. D. Burdick established a sawmill and grist mill nearby in 1864. In 1878, D. H. Day, a land developer and agent for the Northern Transportation Company, took interest in Glen Arbor. Day serves as the namesake for the historic barn that sits opposite of the Sleeping Bear Dunes.

The town&#x27;s economy was largely based around the lumber industry in the mid 19th century. Wood became the first commodity of Leelanau County as it was used for constructing houses and for fueling the steamers that traversed the Great Lakes. The increase of maritime traffic and the constant threat of shipwrecks along the Manitou Passage led the U.S. Life-Saving Service to establish a small boat station at Sleeping Bear Point in 1901. In 1931, the U.S. Coast Guard moved the facility eastward to its present location near Glen Haven, then closed it in 1944. The station is now a maritime museum that is run by the National Park Service.

The size of the town has gradually risen over the years with many summer homes and resorts having been constructed. The primary industry of the town today, especially in the summer months, is tourism.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (67.34%) is water. Glen Arbor Township is located along the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, which in 2011 was named the &quot;Most Beautiful Place in America&quot; by Good Morning America. The town is bordered by Glen Lake to its East and Lake Michigan to its West. Glen Lake is a popular destination for tourists due to its warm turquoise blue waters. The 6.3 mile long Crystal River (Michigan) passes through many points of the township during its duration which spans from Glen Lake to Lake Michigan. The river is popular among fly fisherman and kayakers who enjoy its clear water and pristine wildlife.

South Manitou Island is administered by the National Park Service, but is politically part of Glen Arbor Township.

<text>Greilickville ( ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Leelanau County in the U.S. state of Michigan. At the 2020 census, the population was 1,634, up from 1,530 at the 2010 census. The community is located within Elmwood Charter Township, and is located in the extreme southeast of the Leelanau Peninsula.
The community is located on the western shore of the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay, a bay of Lake Michigan. Greilickville is immediately northwest of Traverse City, and is part of that city&#x27;s urban area. Greilickville is the largest community in Leelanau County by population.

==History==
The Greilickville area was settled by Godfrey Greilick and his family in 1856, recently emigrating from Bohemia. Greilick operated a number of sawmills in southeast Leelanau County. In 1875, brothers Albert and Seth H. Norris established a settlement on the shore of Grand Traverse Bay consisting of a grist mill, tannery, brickyard, and pottery factory, as well as a post office with the name Norrisville. The post office lasted from September 1881 to June 1882, and again from May 1884 to July 1902. In 1874, James W. Markham purchased the Norris&#x27; brickyard, expanding it and establishing commercial service. Markham Bricks, renowned for their pale yellow color derived from sediments in Cedar Lake, was supplied to build much of nearby Traverse City and the Traverse City State Hospital.

In 1893, an extension of the Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad was opened through the community, with a station named Greilickville, in honor of Godfrey Greilick. The community later took on the name. In the early 20th century, Greilickville transitioned to a tourism-based economy, and established itself as a convenient location for tall ships to drop off tourists to the region.

In 1961, when Greilickville&#x27;s population was about 900, a special election was held in sections 28 and 33 of Elmwood Township, including Greilickville, to decide a proposal regarding making those areas a home-rule village called Elmwood. The proposal was defeated by a vote of 238 to 88.

In 1995, the Leelanau Trail, a public rail trail, opened on the right-of-way of the former Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad.

==Geography==
Greilickville is in the southeastern corner of Leelanau County and of Elmwood Charter Township. It is bordered to the south by Traverse City in Grand Traverse County and to the east by the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay, part of Lake Michigan.

<text>Northport is a village in Leelanau County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located near the northern tip of the Leelanau Peninsula, Northport is located within Leelanau Township, and lies on the shore of Grand Traverse Bay, a bay of Lake Michigan. Northport had a population of 496 at the 2020 census. The village is located about north of Traverse City, and is part of that city&#x27;s metropolitan area. From 1863 to 1883, Northport served as the county seat of Leelanau County.

==History==

In 1848 Michigan suffered from a smallpox epidemic that affected the entire community of people. Chief Peter Waukazoo and Reverend George Smith moved the community as well as the Holland-area Ottawa Mission up to the Leelanau Peninsula on boats or canoes. When the settlers had reached their destination they called it Waukazooville. Deacon Joseph Dame arrived at Waukazooville in 1854 and decided to change the name to Northport at this time.

Northport was the largest town in Leelanau County for quite a while in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Several general stores were built in the town in 1859 which sold items such as cloth, thread, needles, foods, axes, and more. There was no doctor in town at this time so Reverend Smith was called on to deliver babies and help the ill.

Many people that ended up living in Northport came from New York or Canada. The fishermen, farmers, and other community members would gather on the bay and cut chunks of ice for fisheries, hotels, or even private homes.

The cherry industry that is prevalent in Northport today had just begun in 1853 on Reverend Smith&#x27;s farm. Farmers began producing cherries so much within those first few years that cherries were being shipped to nearby cities for their markets. The cherry industry in Northport and Leelanau County remains one of the largest in the world.

<text>Suttons Bay is a village in Leelanau County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population in the village reached 613 at the 2020 census. Located within Suttons Bay Township, the community lies upon the shore of the eponymous Suttons Bay, a smaller inlet of Grand Traverse Bay, a bay of Lake Michigan.

==History==

The community is named for one of the first settlers of European descent, Harry C. Sutton, who arrived in 1854. He arrived with a crew of woodsmen to supply fuel for passing wood steamboats.

In 1903 the Traverse City, Leelanau, and Manistique Railroad began a route between Traverse City to the South and Northport to the North, stopping at Suttons Bay, as well as Hatch&#x27;s Crossing, Fountain Point, Bingham, Keswick, and Omena.

Before the turn of the 20th century, four churches had been established—two Lutheran, one Roman Catholic, and one Congregational.

In 1920, Leelanau County voters approved moving the county seat to Suttons Bay, but the move never took place.

Suttons Bay has a school; the sports mascot is a Viking, hence the nickname &quot;Suttons Bay Norsemen.&quot;

The town is home to the county&#x27;s only movie theater, opened in 1946. It is now owned by Bob Bahle, and was renovated in 1977. Its fare consists of unique art house films, and occasionally the theater hosts plays and concerts.

The town has a clothing store that has been owned by one family over four generations called &quot;Bahles.&quot; The original store started as a &quot;dry-goods&quot; business in 1876 by Lars Bahle, an immigrant from Norway.

Suttons Bay is also home to one of the oldest continuously operated food establishments in the entire region. Since 1871, the restaurant has gone through several owners and is currently known as The V I Grill.

==Culture==
Like many other communities in northern Michigan, Suttons Bay relies heavily on tourism to generate revenues for its economy.

Activities include the Suttons Bay Jazzfest and the Suttons Bay Art Festival.

Suttons Bay also is highly embedded in the cherry industry, producing sweet and tart cherries of many varieties. Harvest operations usually take place in mid-July and run into August.

In August 2013, the community held an event to attempt to break the Guinness Book of World Records for most kayaks and canoes rafted together. The effort followed an attempt a year earlier, which missed the record of 1902 boats set by a group near Inlet, New York in 2011.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. The town is located on the shore of Suttons Bay, an inlet Grand Traverse Bay, itself an inlet of Lake Michigan. The town is fifteen miles north of Traverse City.

Just north of the village is a sign marking the 45th parallel north, halfway between the North Pole and the Equator. This is one of six Michigan sites, and 29 in the U.S., where such signs are known to exist.

<text>Suttons Bay Township is a civil township and county seat of Leelanau County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 2,883 at the 2020 census.
The village of Suttons Bay is located within the township along Grand Traverse Bay.

In a 2004 referendum, voters approved moving the county seat from the community of Leland to a site in section 19 in the southwest corner of the township, nearer to the geographic center of the county. Suttons Bay Township is the only civil township to serve as a county seat in the state of Michigan.

==Communities==
*Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians headquarters are located within Suttons Bay Township with a small reservation in the northeast portion of the township near Peshawbestown.
*Lake Leelanau is an unincorporated community and census-designated place partially within Suttons Bay Township. The majority of the community is to the west in Leland Township. 
*Peshawbestown is an unincorporated community along M-22 in the northern portion of the township.
*Suttons Bay is a village within the township.

==History==
In 1854, Harry Chittenden Sutton and his crew established a wooding station to provide fuel to wood-burning steamboats. The Sutton name first caused the village to be called Suttonsburg. Pleasant City was another name, but Suttons Bay was later adopted for this growing community.

Railroads played an important role in the development of the area. Running through Suttons Bay, the train passed near the site of Sutton&#x27;s station and the community&#x27;s next enterprise, a sawmill built by Sutton&#x27;s son-in-law, George Carr, and connected to Fountain Point, an historic resort site.

The township also includes the small Ojibwe community of Peshawbestown, also known as Eagletown. Once a Franciscan mission named after Chief Peshaba, who ruled in the 1880s, this community has grown to include a casino and resort.

Other features of Suttons Bay Township include Lake Leelanau on its southwestern corner, which can be accessed by taking M-204 west to the community of Lake Leelanau, where the channel runs between Lake Leelanau&#x27;s upper and lower lakes. This township is also prime cherry country, with several orchards and wineries among its hills.

The township contains Fountain Point, which was built in 1889 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Addison is a village in Lenawee County of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 573 at the 2020 census. The village is located on the boundary between Rollin Township on the south and Woodstock Township on the north.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

== History ==

In 1834, three years before Michigan became a state, John Talbot settled along a winding creek in a vast forest, dotted with clear blue lakes and occupied by the Potawatomi. With the raising of a simple grist mill along Bean Creek around December 1835, Addison&#x27;s history was started, operating under the settlement name “Manetue.”

Having failed to secure a spot along the river that provided enough water power to run his mill, Talbot dismantled the settlement and moved to the present location of Addison, and by the fall of 1836, milling operations restarted. The town was renamed “Peru” by 1838, and over the next generation would be given several other monikers before the final name of Addison was entered onto plat maps in 1851. Addison J. Comstock, a banker from Adrian, Michigan, purchased a sizable plat of the pioneer town and changed the identity to reflect this acquisition. The village itself was incorporated as such in 1893.

The village grew sufficiently to attract the railroad in 1883, an event which contributed to a sudden expansion of the local economy. Businesses came to Addison in great numbers including a three-story hotel, designed to cater to the visiting tourist. The Addison Courier newspaper started its 76-year run in 1884, and the economic upturn brought on by the railroad continued well after the line ceased to operate through Addison.

One of Addison&#x27;s last landmarks, the old grist mill built in 1848, was removed in 1980. Despite the economic downturn of the village in the last half of the 20th century, a large 3-day sesquicentennial celebration was held in 1984. Additionally, a 175th Anniversary celebration spanning only one day was held in the village on August 8, 2009.
In the later 2010s, the medical cannabis industry identified Addison as a community open to economic expansion with provisioning and grow centers. As of 2022, Addison has two open facilities and two additional operations under construction.

Two history books have been written on the village in recent years, &quot;The History of Addison, Michigan&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Memories of Addison&quot; in 2013, both by village historian Dan Cherry. Among the early village historians were A.J. Kempton, Richard DeGreene, J. DeWitt McLouth and Alice Slocum.

Addison got its own radio station in August 2014 with the sign-on of WQAR-LP &quot;Q95 the Panther&quot; at 95.7 FM. The station is owned by Addison Community Schools and programmed by students with classic rock music.

Addison Community Schools is a K-12 central campus with 797 students. The current superintendent is Scott Salow. The school mascot is a black panther.

<text>Adrian is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan and the county seat of Lenawee County. The population was 20,645 at the 2020 census. Adrian lies in Michigan&#x27;s 5th congressional district.

==History==

Adrian was founded on June 18, 1826 by Addison Comstock. The original name for the village was Logan, but was changed soon after to Adrian, perhaps in reference to the Roman emperor Hadrian. The first operating railroad in Michigan was a horse-drawn train running between Adrian and Toledo in 1836. Adrian grew quickly, with the sixth largest population in the state when Michigan was admitted to the Union in 1837, and the third largest population in the state by . Adrian was incorporated as a village on March 28, 1836, then as a city on January 31, 1853.

===Underground Railroad===
Evangelical and Hicksite Quakers in Southeast Michigan founded the first congregation of Quakers in Michigan in 1831. They also created a network of Underground Railroad stations in the Raisin River Valley. Daniel Smith was the first leader of the Raisin Valley Friends Meeting House. His daughter, Laura Smith Haviland became one of the most prominent equal rights activists and Underground Railroad operators in the nation. Elizabeth Margaret Chandler established the Logan Female Anti-Slavery Society in October 1832. Chandler’s society preceded the Female Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia and the Michigan statewide organization. The Adrian-Tecumseh Underground Railroad network was established by a Baptist minister in northern Lenawee County.

=== Late 1800s and 1900s ===
The only remaining piece of the Bank of Pennsylvania— one of the stone pillars — was moved to Adrian, Michigan and erected as the Civil War Memorial in commemoration of those in Adrian who died in the American Civil War.

In the late 19th century through early 20th century Adrian was known as the &quot;fence capital of the world,&quot; when J. Wallace Page invented the first successful wire fence. Adrian became known worldwide as a fencing manufacturing hub and its fences were shipped as far as New York, Berlin, Asia, and Africa. The company sponsored the highly successful Page Fence Giants black baseball team.

Adrian was an early auto manufacturing hub. One of the first motor vehicles, the Lion automobile, was created in Adrian. Between 1900 and 1912, three major car models were manufactured in Adrian; in addition to the Lion the Murry Motor Car and Lenawee Car were made by the Church Manufacturing Company in Adrian. The area was poised to be a world center until bad financial decisions at Church Manufacturing Company and a 1912 plant fire at Lion Automobile led to the demise of both companies.

Throughout the 1900s Adrian continued to grow, doubling in size, but as a slower rate than Michigan as a whole (which tripled in size).

==Geography==
Adrian is approximately southwest of Ann Arbor, southeast of Jackson, and northwest of Toledo, Ohio.

<text>Adrian Charter Township is a charter township of Lenawee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The township population was 6,401 at the 2020 census. The city of Adrian borders on the south, but the two are administered autonomously.

==Communities==
*Birdsall is an unincorporated community located along M-52 on the eastern border of the township with Raisin Township at . The community was first settled as early as 1827 by farmer Darius Comstock, who was the brother of Addison Comstock, who founded the community of Adrian. The area settled around a Quaker school and seminary, which operated from 1850 to 1907. In 1897, the community received a station along the Detroit &amp; Lima Northern Railroad. That year, a post office opened on July 15, 1897 and was named Birdsall after the first and only postmaster, Daniel B. Birdsall. The post office operated only briefly and closed on October 15, 1901.

==History==
The present boundaries of Adrian Township correspond to survey township 6 South Range 3 East. Lenawee County was initially divided into three townships by act of the Michigan Territorial Council on April 12, 1827. Tecumseh Township spanned the northern portion of the county, Logan Township spanned the middle tier, and Blissfield Township spanned the southern tier (and also included an area in the Toledo Strip which ultimately became part of Ohio).

Over time, new townships were created and the area of Logan Township was reduced. By an act of the Territorial Legislature on March 7, 1834, Logan Township was reduced to consist of T6S R3E and was renamed as Adrian Township to match that of Adrian, the main village in the township. The village of Adrian was platted under the name Logan in 1828 by Addison J. Comstock, but was soon renamed Adrian after the Roman Emperor Hadrian at the request of Comstock&#x27;s wife.

<text>Manitou Beach–Devils Lake is a census-designated place (CDP) in Lenawee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population of the CDP was 2,032 at the 2020 census. It is located within Rollin Township to the south and Woodstock Township to the north.

The census-designated place consists of the unincorporated communities of Devils Lake, Geneva, and Manitou Beach and includes the larger lakes of Devils Lake and Round Lake.

==Communities==
* Devils Lake is at the northern end of Devils Lake on U.S. Route 223 at . 
* Geneva is at the south end of the smaller Round Lake to the southeast, at .
* Manitou Beach is at the southwest end of Devils Lake at , approximately southwest of Devils Lake and about east-southeast of Addison. Manitou Beach contains its own post office that uses the 49523 ZIP Code that serves the majority of the CDP and parts of the surrounding area.

==History==


Devil&#x27;s Lake was a Potawatami village until about 1830. Most of the people were forced west of the Mississippi River after passage of the Indian Removal Act that year under President Andrew Jackson.

Manitou Beach was first noted by Euro-American settlers in the early 1830s. By the turn of the 20th century, it became a favored resort in southeast Michigan. It quickly outgrew the comparably sized community of Devils Lake at the north end of the lake. Steam launches ferried tourists from the depot to the hotels and attractions, which included bath houses, a dance pavilion, pleasure craft rental facilities, a water slide, picnic areas and eating establishments. The name &#x27;Manitou Beach&#x27; is derived from the Potawatomi name of Devils Lake, &quot;&quot;Michemanetue&#x27;&quot;, meaning, &quot;Lake of God (&quot;Michi Mantitou&quot; is a variation of the Ojibwe word for the Creator)

The Manitou Beach post office was established on March 20, 1889, with Columbus F. Becker as the first postmaster. The office was discontinued on December 31, 1892, and reestablished on January 17, 1893. Manitou Beach was a station on the Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railroad (later part of the Cincinnati Northern Railway).

Devil&#x27;s Lake was said to have been named by Potawatomi leader Meteau (or Mitteau) after his daughter drowned in the lake and her body was never recovered. As she had been an able swimmer, Meteau believed her to have been taken by evil spirits.

The first European-American, or white, settlers arrived here in 1833. The Devils Lake post office was established on October 19, 1885, with John B. Allen as the first postmaster. The office was discontinued on October 31, 1936. The Detroit, Toledo and Milwaukee Railroad had a stop at Devil&#x27;s Lake.

In the late 20th century, the Manitou Beach region was devastated by two F4 tornadoes during the April 11, 1965 Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak. Most of what was destroyed was rebuilt, including the dance hall and two churches. Over the course of the past five decades, the resort has had few reminders of the tornado.

The Devils Lake Drive-In-Church, a drive-in movie theater, closed its doors after 58 seasons due to the death of its operator. The Manitou Beach Inn, a long-time staple of the business community, was destroyed by fire January 3, 2010. When the inn was rebuilt, it helped start revitalization of the historic business district along Walnut Street.
