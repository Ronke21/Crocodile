<text>Archibald Cox Jr. (May 17, 1912 – May 29, 2004) was an American legal scholar who served as U.S. Solicitor General under President John F. Kennedy and as a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal. During his career, he was a pioneering expert on labor law and was also an authority on constitutional law. &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot; has identified Cox as one of the most cited legal scholars of the 20th century.

Cox was Senator John F. Kennedy&#x27;s labor advisor and in 1961, President Kennedy appointed him solicitor general, an office he held for four and a half years. Cox became famous when, under mounting pressure and charges of corruption against persons closely associated with Richard Nixon, Attorney General nominee Elliot Richardson appointed him as Special Prosecutor to oversee the federal criminal investigation into the Watergate burglary and other related crimes that became popularly known as the Watergate scandal. He had a dramatic confrontation with Nixon when he subpoenaed the tapes the president had secretly recorded of his Oval Office conversations. When Cox refused a direct order from the White House to seek no further tapes or presidential materials, Nixon fired him in an incident that became known as the Saturday Night Massacre. Cox&#x27;s firing produced a public relations disaster for Nixon and set in motion impeachment proceedings which ended with Nixon stepping down from the presidency.

Cox returned to teaching, lecturing, and writing for the rest of his life, giving his opinions on the role of the Supreme Court in the development of the law and the role of the lawyer in society. Although he was recommended to President Jimmy Carter for a seat on the First Circuit Court of Appeals, Cox&#x27;s nomination fell victim to the dispute between the president and Senator Ted Kennedy. He was appointed to head several public-service, watchdog and good-government organizations, including serving for 12 years as head of Common Cause. Cox was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board in 1976 and 1997. In addition, he argued two important Supreme Court cases, winning both in part: one concerning the constitutionality of federal campaign finance restrictions (&quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot;) and the other the leading early case testing affirmative action (&quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot;).

==Early life, education and private practice==

===Family and ancestors===
Cox was born in Plainfield, New Jersey in 1912, the son of Archibald and Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Bruen Perkins Cox, the eldest of seven children. His father Archibald Sr. (Harvard College, 1896; Harvard Law School, 1899) was the son of a Manhattan lawyer, Rowland Cox, and rose to prominence as a patent and trademark lawyer, and who wrote &quot;Cox&#x27;s Manual on Trade Marks&quot;. When Rowland Cox died suddenly in 1900, Archibald Sr. inherited his father&#x27;s solo practice almost right out of law school. He built on that start to become successful in his own right. His most prominent achievement was securing the red cross as the trademark of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Compared to the lawyers on his mother&#x27;s side, his father (as Archibald Jr. reflected late in his life) did not participate much in public service, although he had &quot;done a few things for Woodrow Wilson … at the time of the peace conference&quot; and was president of the local Board of Education. He also served as a member of the New Jersey Rapid Transit Commission.

===Education===
Cox attended the private Wardlaw School, then located in Plainfield, New Jersey, until he was fourteen. Afterwards, he studied at St. Paul&#x27;s School in New Hampshire, attending due to his father&#x27;s intervention on his behalf despite low grades.

Cox thrived at St. Paul and in his final year, he won the Hugh Camp Memorial Cup for public speaking and led the school&#x27;s debate team to defeat Groton. It was during this period that he read Beveridge&#x27;s &quot;Life of John Marshall&quot;, which was an important early ingredient in Cox&#x27;s progressive view of the law. With a warm recommendation from the head-master (and family connections), Cox was able to enter Harvard College in 1930.

====College====
At Harvard, Cox joined a final club, the Delphic Club, called the &quot;Gashouse&quot; for its parties, gambling and liquor (during Prohibition). He majored in history, government and economics and did slightly better than &quot;gentlemanly Cs.&quot;

It was during the second semester of his freshman year that his father died, at age 56. For Cox&#x27;s senior thesis he proposed analyzing the constitutional differences of the composition between the Senate and House of Representatives through early American history. His advisor, Paul Buck, told him he did not &quot;have brains enough&quot; for the project. Cox took up the challenge and completed &quot;Senatorial Saucer.&quot; As a result of the work Cox was able to graduate with honors in History. Cox continued on to Harvard Law School in 1934.

====Law school====
Cox thrived at law school, ranking first in his class of 593 at the end of his first year. Cox&#x27;s second year was taken up with work on the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. He also met his future wife Phyllis Ames. Cox proposed to her after only three or four meetings. She initially put him off, but by March 1936 they were engaged. Phyllis, who graduated Smith the year before, was the granddaughter of James Barr Ames, one time dean of Harvard Law School and noted for popularizing the casebook method of legal study. Professor (and later United States Associate Justice) Felix Frankfurter wrote them a congratulatory note on their betrothal, which exclaimed: &quot;My God, what a powerful legal combination!&quot; Cox graduated in 1937 &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, one of nine receiving the highest honor awarded by the law school that year. Two weeks before his commencement, Cox and Phyllis married. Moving to New York City after law school, Cox served as a clerk with United States District Court Judge Learned Hand.

===Private practice and wartime service===
After a year in New York City, Cox accepted an associate position with the Boston law firm of Ropes, Gray, Best, Coolidge and Rugg. After World War II began, Cox took a position in the United States Solicitor General&#x27;s office. By 1943, Cox had advanced to become Assistant Solicitor of the Labor Department.

====Solicitor in the Labor Department====
As associate solicitor, Cox&#x27; job in the Labor Department was to supervise enforcement at the District Court level of federal labor statutes. Cox had a staff of eight lawyers in Washington and supervised the department&#x27;s regional offices, including deciding when a regional attorney could bring suit. Most of the litigation involved wage and hours issues under the Fair Labor Standards Act. His background in the solicitor general&#x27;s office also allowed him to handle much of the appellate work. By virtue of his position, Cox also occasionally sat as an alternative public member of the Wage Adjustment Board, which dealt with the construction industry and attempted to maintain labor peace by mediating non-wage disputes and setting prevailing wage rates and increases under the Davis–Bacon Act.

===Harvard faculty and labor arbitrator===
After WWII was over, Cox returned to the law firm Ropes, Gray with the intention of spending his professional career there. Instead, he lasted five weeks. Dean Landis of the Harvard Law School offered to hire Cox as a probationary teacher in the fall of 1945. Cox accepted, despite the substantial cut in salary he would take, but on the condition that he would not have to teach corporations or property. Landis agreed; his expectation was that Cox should become a nationally recognized expert in labor law. In addition to labor law, Cox started out teaching torts. Later he would also teach unfair competition, agency and administrative law. He was made a permanent professor during the 1946–47 academic year, a time when the law school greatly increased enrollment in the post-war boom.

As a legal scholar and professor at Harvard throughout the 1950s, Cox became immensely influential in the labor field. His writing was so prolific that Dean Griswold pointed to Cox when he needed an example of the kind of academic output he was seeking from the faculty. Given that the peak of his academic career also coincided with the enactment of the statutes that defined industrial relations, his work, usually the first on any new topic, shaped the Supreme Court&#x27;s thinking. His one-time student and later colleague Derek Bok described this influence:

In addition to his direct effect on Supreme Court decisions, Cox&#x27;s scholarly writing influenced other academics and practitioners who widely cited him. &quot;The Journal of Legal Studies&quot; lists Cox as one of the most-cited legal scholars of the twentieth century. The framework he developed, first in the two articles with Dunlop in 1950–51, then elaborated on his own, became the standard view of the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts. It assumed roughly equal bargaining power between union and management and interpreted the labor laws (often contrary to the language of the statutes themselves) to limit individual employee rights unless pursued by his bargaining agent, to restrict the subjects on which management is required to bargain based on past practices, to permit unions to waive rights the statutes otherwise gave to employees and in general to advocate the notion that labor statutes should be interpreted to promote industrial peace over enhancing the economic power of labor. The framework remained the dominant view of federal labor relations until the late 1950s when concerns over member participation began to shape policy. It would be Cox and his work with Senator John F. Kennedy on the bill that became the Landrum–Griffin Act that would initiate the new framework.

==Advisor to Senator Kennedy and role in the Kennedy administration==

===Kennedy advisor, then partisan===

====Kennedy&#x27;s labor expert====
In 1953 the young and ambitious John F. Kennedy, new to the Senate, decided that labor relations would be the area that he would specialize in to begin building a policy and legislative resume for use in future political endeavors. He wrote to Cox in March 1953 inviting him to testify before the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. Cox was a natural ally to seek out. He was one of Kennedy&#x27;s constituents and a fellow Harvard alumnus. More importantly, he was a nationally recognized academic expert on labor law and a liberal Democrat with a predisposition towards labor.

In the fall of 1959, after the work on the Landrum–Griffin Act had wound up, Kennedy confided to Cox that he was running for president. In January 1960, he wrote Cox formally asking him to head up his efforts to &quot;tap intellectual talent in the Cambridge area&quot; and then &quot;ride herd over twenty or thirty college professors&quot; in their activities for him. Cox brought a number of eminent policy experts in a number of fields into contact with Kennedy. Although many were skeptical of his candidacy and some had been loyal to or inclined towards either Adlai Stevenson or Hubert Humphrey, Kennedy won them over at a meeting in Boston&#x27;s Harvard Club on January 24. In the period leading up to the Democratic Convention in July, Cox acted mainly as a &quot;stimulator&quot; to prod various academics to send memoranda to Kennedy or to find academics to supply Kennedy with policy positions on specific topics. While before the Convention, Cox had not recruited extensively beyond the Boston area, he had at least one recruit from the University of Colorado and recruited from Stanford. as well. Even though the number was not large before the nomination, no other Democratic contender, not even Stevenson, had made an effort to recruit intellectual partisans.
As with the case of Cox&#x27;s informal group of labor advisors, Kennedy was anxious to use Cox&#x27;s contacts not only for their expertise but also for the éclat they gave his campaign. A &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; article in April, widely reprinted in local papers, named Cox and the other Cambridge advisors as a key to the kinds of policies Kennedy would advocate. &quot;Of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s political talents none has been more helpful to him than his ability to attract capable men to his cause,&quot; the &quot;Times&quot; said in the middle of the convention. The description of Cox&#x27;s academic advisers was designed to recall Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Brain Trusts&quot;: &quot;More ideas poured in from Cambridge, Mass., where an astounding galaxy of scholars had made themselves an informal brain-trust for Senator Kennedy.&quot;

After the Los Angeles Convention Kennedy, now the nominee, asked Cox to move to Washington to have an expanded role, hiring speechwriters and coordinating academic talent. Cox accepted, and then Kennedy point blank asked Cox if he thought he could get along with Ted Sorensen and explained &quot;Sorensen&#x27;s fear that somebody was going to elbow his way in between him and Kennedy.&quot; Cox assumed he could. Cox had been unaware that Sorensen had already been at work, back in February, trying to compartmentalize and minimize Cox&#x27; group&#x27;s efforts. Sorenen told Joseph A. Loftus of the &quot;Times&quot; that the Cambridge group was &quot;something &#x27;much more talked about than fact.&#x27;&quot; Cox would soon discover, however, that Sorensen always &quot;was terribly worried about being cut out&quot; and protected Kennedy from independent advice, including Cox&#x27;.

===Solicitor General of the United States===

After Kennedy&#x27;s election in 1960, despite publicly downplaying the idea that he was being considered for public office, Cox was concerned he might be offered a seat on the NLRB or a second echelon position in the Department of Labor. Neither position offered new challenges for him, but he worried about the propriety of refusing. Before leaving for his family Christmas celebration in Windsor, Cox was tipped off by Anthony Lewis of the &quot;Times&quot; that he had been chosen for Solicitor General. Cox decided that if this was true, he would tell the president-elect that he needed time to think the matter over. But when Kennedy called, interrupting a family lunch, he accepted immediately. Cox was unaware until much later that his law school colleague, Paul Freund, whom he had recommended for the position, declined and recommended Cox in turn. Next month, Cox appeared before the Senate Judicial Committee for confirmation hearings, but his reputation was such that the hearing took only ten minutes; even minority leader Dirksen, who knew Cox from Landrum–Griffin days, said he &quot;had been quite impressed with his legal abilities … .&quot;

In the nearly century-long period that the office had existed before Cox occupied it, the solicitor general, as the government&#x27;s lawyer before the Supreme Court, was immensely influential. Cox held the position at a time when the Warren Court was about to involve the Court in issues never before considered appropriate for judicial review, at a time when the country was ready for the Court to decide various questions of social justice and individual rights. Cox was aware of the pivotal time the Court and he faced and explained it in an address right before the beginning of the first full Term he would argue in:


====Civil rights and sit-in cases====
During the customary introduction of the Solicitor General to the members of the Court, Justice Frankfurter had an extended talk with his former student. The justice advised Cox that the first case to argue should be something involving criminal law. Cox gave due weight to the recommendation, but he met vigorous objections from his assistant Oscar Davis, who argued that civil rights was the most important legal issue facing the country and that Cox should signal in his first argued case the new administration&#x27;s commitment to fight for it. Cox agreed and selected &quot;Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority&quot;. The case, brought by an African-American who was barred from a private restaurant that rented space in a building owned by the state of Delaware, confronted the Court squarely with the limitations on the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of &quot;equal protection of the laws&quot; – erected by the so-called Civil Rights Cases of 1883, which held that the constitutional guarantee only applied against &quot;state action.&quot; Cox persuaded the Court that the fact that the business was a state lessee as well as franchisee, was located in a parking complex developed by the state to promote business, and that the complex flew a Delaware flag in front of the building, all rendered the state a &quot;joint participant&quot; with the restaurant, sufficient to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court agreed. It was the beginning of the Court&#x27;s dilution of the &quot;state action&quot; requirement in racial discrimination cases.
By May 1961, the civil rights movement, led by James Farmer of CORE, initiated what would become a wave of non-violent confrontations against discrimination in public transit and other accommodations. The attorney general&#x27;s office, under the personal supervision of Robert Kennedy, took active measures to protect the protestors in the face of local political and police indifference to or active complicity with violent resisters. Cox was regularly involved in meetings over day-to-day Justice Department activities, while at the same time he prepared to argue cases seeking to overturn state court convictions of civil rights protestors (under various statutes dealing with vagrancy, trespass and even parading without a permit.) Cox came into close contact with Robert Kennedy, and while the two had vastly different styles (Kennedy was impulsive and somewhat cavalier of legal principles; Cox was cautious against making missteps that would set the movement back or commit the Court to a position on which it might lose its legitimacy), Cox grew to admire Kennedy. Prior to the Ole Miss riot the subject reluctantly gave counsel to the President. Impatient of a piecemeal approach, Robert Kennedy, but more importantly the civil rights community and particularly Jack Greenberg of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, sought near elimination of the &quot;state action&quot; doctrine, arguing that restaurants were like &quot;common carriers&quot;, subject to the Fourteenth Amendment or that the mere act of enforcing a trespass law, used to further private discrimination, was itself sufficient &quot;state action.&quot;

Cox did not believe the Court would make so radical a break with eighty-year-old precedent, so in each case he argued on narrow grounds that did not require the Court to overrule the Civil Rights Cases, and each case he won on those grounds, in the process infuriating Jack Greenberg, who was arguing in those very cases for the broader approach. The cautious approach, however, garnered Cox much credibility with the Court, which came to realize that he was not going to lead them into areas with uncertain future consequences. After a number of these cases, however, even the Court requested briefing in 1962 on the &quot;state action&quot; doctrine in &quot;Bell v. Maryland&quot;. Cox took a slightly more advanced position, arguing that where trespass laws were used to prosecute civil rights demonstrators in states such as Maryland, where there was a history of racial segregation by custom and law, then the discrimination was part of the enforcement sufficient to invoke state action. Although even this position disappointed civil rights activists and the Justice Department, it prevailed, but in the face of three dissents (including that of Justice Black), suggesting that a broader rule might have been rejected by a majority. The issue would be mooted by legislation dealing with &quot;public accommodations&quot;, which Cox helped draft and defended before the Court in 1965.

====Reapportionment cases====
The cases that troubled Cox the most during his tenure, and the area where he differed widest from Robert Kennedy, involved malapportionment of voting districts. Over the years failure to re-allocate voting districts particularly in state legislatures, produced wildly disproportionate districts, with rural areas having many fewer voters than urban districts as a result of the urbanization of America. The result was dilution of the urban vote with policy resulting accordingly; rectification would benefit Democrats politically, while malapportionment stood as an obstacle to legislation that improved the lot of city-dwellers, minorities and the poor. The problem was that Justice Frankfurter had written in a plurality decision in 1946 that such issues amounted to a political question—a matter not appropriate for the Court to resolve. On the other hand, given that political interests were entrenched, and those with disproportionate power were not likely to give up their greater share, a political solution was unlikely. But a case surfaced from Tennessee that seemed ideal to test that ruling. Tennessee had not reapportioned its legislature since 1910 and, as a result, there were urban districts that had eleven times the citizens of rural districts. Cox decided to submit an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief supporting the plaintiffs in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;. The case was argued once in April 1961 and re-argued in October. In between Cox was subjected to an unpleasant onslaught by Frankfurter at a public dinner and relentless questions in the October argument. When the decision was announced, however, Frankfurter was joined by only Harlan; the result was 6–2.

The first case proved far easier than Cox expected. The holding was relatively narrow, simply providing federal court jurisdiction, and followed the points in Cox&#x27;s brief. But Cox had much more difficulty with the follow-up cases, because he could not persuade himself that history or legal theory would demand a one-man-one-vote standard in all cases. He developed what he later called a &quot;highly complex set of criteria,&quot; but in the end when the Court finally erected the one-man-one-vote standard it simply made the general rule subject to all the exceptions that Cox had tried to weave into his proposed standards. As Chief Justice Warren&#x27;s clerk later told him &quot;all the Chief did was take your brief and turn it upside down and write exceptions to the one-person one-vote that covered all the cases that you had attempted to exclude by this complicated formula.&quot;. The case was &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), holding that election districts must be roughly proportional to population.

====After Kennedy====
According to columnist William V. Shannon, President Kennedy had planned to appoint Cox to the next opening on the Supreme Court. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach became Cox&#x27;s direct superior. The first request of the acting Attorney General was that Cox accompany him to see the chief justice and request him to head a commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy. Cox was reluctant, believing that Warren should refuse the request, because it would have adverse impact on the Court. He agreed but asked that Katzenbach not have him try to persuade the chief justice. In the end Warren declined the request, and the two Justice employees left. Within an hour President Johnson called Warren, who capitulated. Warren said in 1969 that because of it, it became &quot;the unhappiest year of my life.&quot;

The civil rights legislation that Kennedy was unable to see pass during his lifetime received the needed momentum from his death and the legislative skill of President Johnson. In 1964 the public accommodations bill passed as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The obvious constitutional attack on the legislation was its constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment because it sought to regulate conduct that was not &quot;state action.&quot; Cox and Assistant Attorney General and Head of the Civil Rights Division Burke Marshall, however founded the legislation on Congress&#x27;s power to regulate interstate commerce. Although both John and Robert Kennedy questioned the optics of using the Commerce Clause, they did not object.Cox had no difficulty having the Court uphold the statute on that basis when he argued the cases in October.

After a landslide election victory, Johnson used his State of the Union address in January 1965 to, among other things, promise a voting rights act. It was Cox who developed the first draft. The mechanism devised by Cox was to provide for a presumption of illegality of a list of practices including literacy tests and similar devices if the state had a history of low minority voter turn-out as shown by voter statistics. In such cases the burden was shifted to the state to prove nondiscriminatory intent. This mechanism remained the heart of the legislation throughout the legislative process. Both Ramsey Clark and Nicholas Katzenbach admired the mechanism for its legal craftsmanship and statecraft (because it avoided the need to prove intent to discriminate). Before the bill was submitted to Congress Cox answered a question in Court that was used by nationally syndicated columnist Drew Pearson to embarrass Cox before the new president. On January 28, Cox urged the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court decision that held that the federal government had no power to sue a state alleging violation of the Fifteenth Amendment by discriminatory devices aimed at African-Americans. Cox argued the narrow ground that the government had such power. When the Court expressly asked Cox whether he was asking the Court to strike down the statutes, Cox answered that he was not, only that the case be remanded to the three-court panel. The Court&#x27;s opinion, delivered on March 8, highlighted this exchange in such a way that some inferred that Cox passed up a golden opportunity. Pearson&#x27;s column stated that Cox had cost the civil rights movement two years in litigation, and for that he point blank suggested that Johnson replace Cox as solicitor general.

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 mooted that case, and Cox would go on to defend the legislation successfully before the Court, but he did so as a private attorney. In the summer after Johnson&#x27;s victory Cox offered his resignation in order that Johnson might pick his own Solicitor General if he chose. Although Cox dearly loved the job, he overrode Katzenbach&#x27;s strong objections to his decision. Johnson accepted the resignation on June 25, 1965.

Chief Justice Warren was &quot;non-plussed and made unhappy by the news&quot; that Cox was not reappointed. Senator Kennedy delivered a tribute from the well of the Senate. Even years later his colleagues in the Justice Department praised his service. John W. Douglas, for example, said &quot;he was the best solicitor general that the department&#x27;s ever had … .&quot; John Seigenthaler likewise found him &quot;great.&quot; Students of the office have agreed. Lincoln Caplan called him one of the three most respected Solicitors General in history (together with Robert H. Jackson and John W. Davis). Bruce Terris, who was Assistant Solicitor General in three administrations, said that he &quot;was the best oral advocate I ever saw. … He had the ability to do something I had never seen anybody ever having the ability to do, and I suspect very few people ever had, and that was he had the ability to lecture the Supreme Court. &quot; Even critic Victor Navasky wrote that Cox was &quot;by general agreement one of the most distinguished Solicitors General in the history of the office … .&quot; As Solicitor General Cox personally argued 67 cases before the Court, prevailing in 81%. A study of the eight Solicitors General between 1953 and 1982 found that Cox was the most liberal, filing liberal briefs in 77% of the cases. Supreme Court litigation was his metier, so much so that he would continue to do it in the future even (or especially) when he received no fee.

In 1965, Cox returned to Harvard Law School as a visiting professor, teaching a course in current constitutional law and a section in criminal law.

In 1969, the Legal Services Program (LSP) would bring Shapiro v. Thompson to the Supreme Court after successful arguments in the District court of Connecticut. The first set of oral arguments before the Supreme Court happened on May 1, 1968. Cox would become the primary counsel for Thompson during the rehearing on the 23-24th of October 23-24th 1968. Edward Sparer, considered the &#x27;father of welfare law&#x27; personally brought in Cox as the lead attorney for the rehearing in 1968. Jacqueline Jones, a social historian, articulates that Archibald Cox&#x27;s involvement with this case was coordinated. Sparer brought in Cox&#x27;s legal assistance as he was the solicitor general, well-respected, and a recognized face by the Warren Court. Shapiro v. Thompson was affirmed and Cox&#x27;s oral argument that welfare was a fundamental right was key to Justice Brennan&#x27;s majority opinion. This case would also contribute to Justice Warren&#x27;s &quot;unhappiest year&quot; in 1969, as this case caused direct conflict between Justices Brennan and Warren. 

==Watergate special prosecutor==

===Terms of engagement===
Cox was at Berkeley on May 16, 1973, when Secretary of Defense Elliot Richardson, President Nixon&#x27;s nominee for attorney general, called him to ask if he would consider taking the position of Special Prosecutor in the Watergate affair. Cox had woken up that morning, the day before his 61st birthday, without hearing in his right ear (a condition his doctor would tell him a few days later was permanent), which dampened his enthusiasm for the job—the sensing of which, perhaps, increased Richardson&#x27;s willingness to make concessions to obtain Cox&#x27;s consent. Richardson, for his part, was getting &quot;desperate&quot; according to his aide John T. Smith. It was clear that the Senate would make the appointment of a Special Prosecutor a condition of Richardson&#x27;s confirmation. Richardson&#x27;s staff had prepared a list of 100 candidates. Richardson did not recall how many he had contacted before Cox. Richardson satisfied Cox&#x27;s concern over independence over two days of phone conversations, and Richardson reduced it to writing.

The resulting &quot;compact&quot; was extraordinary even under the circumstances. The scope was &quot;all offenses arising out of the 1972 election … involving the president, the White House staff or presidential appointments.&quot; It was thus not limited to Watergate. The assumption of responsibility for a case was left to the discretion of the Special Prosecutor, who also had sole discretion to decide &quot;whether and to what extent he will inform or consult with the attorney general&quot; on any matter being investigated. The White House thus lost its access to the investigation. In addition, the Special Prosecutor was granted the right to discuss his findings and progress with the press at his discretion. Finally, Cox could be dismissed only by Richardson and only for &quot;extraordinary improprieties&quot;—a standard virtually impossible to meet. The importance of the selection to Richardson&#x27;s confirmation was highlighted by the fact that he brought Cox along to his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Democratic Whip Senator Robert Byrd asked Cox if he needed broader authority. Cox replied that he already had &quot;the whip hand.&quot; Cox said that the only restraint the president or the Justice Department had over him was to fire him. He also vowed that he would follow the evidence even if it led &quot;to the oval office.&quot; Richardson was confirmed.

===Reaction===
The president publicly welcomed the selection and, consistent with his new public relations offensive, commended Richardson&#x27;s &quot;determination&quot; to get to the bottom of the affair. Privately, Nixon seethed with anger. In his memoir he said: &quot;If Richardson searched specifically for the man whom I least trusted, he could hardly have done better.&quot; Richardson, however, thought he had the best man for the job, because once Cox cleared the president there would be no hint that he colluded with Nixon or even that he was sympathetic. Richardson had perhaps been misled about what his assignment was (and what the president&#x27;s true intentions were) when the president instructed him the night Kleindienst was dismissed to &quot;get to the bottom of it&quot; &quot;no matter who[m] it hurts.&quot; Richardson was to &quot;stand firm&quot; only on two issues: presidential conversations were to remain privileged and national security matters were not to be investigated. Otherwise &quot;I don&#x27;t give a Goddam what it is—Mitchell, Stans—anybody.&quot; If there were any doubt, the president insisted to Richardson: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to believe I didn&#x27;t know anything.&quot;

Official Washington, however, was skeptical; Cox, they thought, would be ineffective; he was &quot;too soft—not nasty enough.&quot; James Doyle, a &quot;Washington Star&quot; reporter who would later become the chief press advisor for Cox&#x27;s group, described his own first reaction to meeting Cox: &quot;Prosecutors are supposed to have the instincts of a shark; this one seemed more like a dolphin.&quot; That Cox was insufficiently attuned to the politics of his situation was on show when he invited to his swearing-in Senator Ted Kennedy (the one Democrat whom Nixon loathed and feared) as well as Robert Kennedy&#x27;s widow; had it take place in his old solicitor general&#x27;s office; and had his old boss, President Roosevelt&#x27;s Solicitor General Charles Fahy, administer the oath. It convinced Nixon that Cox saw his job as to bring down the president. Nixon now regarded him as a 
&quot;partisan viper.&quot; Not long afterwards, Cox offended Senate Democrats as well by revealing at a press conference a letter requesting Senator Sam Ervin to cancel or at least postpone the Senate Watergate hearings so that he could familiarize himself with the proceedings. Ervin told the press: &quot;Professor Cox&#x27;s request is extraordinarily arrogant.&quot;

===Staffing up===
After he was sworn in on May 25, 1973, Cox returned to Cambridge where he recruited two professors, James Vorenberg and Philip Heymann, to join his staff. The three arrived in Washington on May 29. Cox was faced with reports that the team of federal prosecutors under Earl J. Silbert was about to resign unless given a vote of confidence. Cox appealed to their sense of professionalism without comment on how the case was handled. A bigger problem was Silbert&#x27;s boss, Henry E. Petersen, a career FBI/Justice Department employee appointed Assistant Attorney General by Nixon, who had regular meetings with Nixon, but would only provide vague descriptions to Cox, and point blank refused to turn over his memorandum of one such meeting, claiming executive privilege on behalf of Nixon.

Cox concluded that a top priority was to hire a pre-eminent criminal trial attorney to supervise the prosecutors until the office was up and running and then try the cases after indictment. He persuaded James F. Neal, the U.S. attorney who obtained the conviction of Jimmy Hoffa in 1964 for jury tampering, now in private practice, to come aboard for several weeks to stabilize the ship. Neal would stay to the end, at the end of each promised period promising only a few more weeks; he became Cox&#x27;s number two man, picked to be the chief trial attorney. Vorenberg became number three and spent much of the early period recruiting lawyers. Vorenberg divided the mission into five task forces: the first to sign on was Thomas F. McBride who would head up the task force on campaign contributions and would obtain the conviction of George Steinbrenner; William Merril would head up the Plumbers task force; Richard J. Davis would handle the task force investigating &quot;dirty tricks;&quot; Joseph J. Connolly headed up the force investigating the ITT antitrust settlement; and James Neal headed the largest group, the Watergate task force, which dealt with the cover up and included George Frampton, Richard Ben-Veniste, and Jill Wine Volner. Henry S. Ruth became Cox&#x27;s deputy and Phil Lacovara became Cox&#x27;s counsel. With a view toward establishing better relations with the press, Cox designated James Doyle his spokesman.

===Joining issue===
The Special Prosecutor&#x27;s office had to catch up with the federal prosecutors. The Senate Watergate committee was in competition for Dean&#x27;s testimony, and leaks suggested they were about to get it. On June 3, published reports said that Dean would testify that he had spoken to the president about Watergate 35 times. On the next day the Deputy White House spokesman admitted that the two spoke frequently, but insisted that the discussions were in furtherance of the president&#x27;s new determination to get to the bottom of the scandal. The spokesman admitted there were logs of all such conversations, but that they would not be turned over on the ground that they were covered by &quot;executive privilege.&quot; Before Cox could litigate the issue of executive privilege and his entitlement to the documents, he had to fashion a reasonably specific subpoena that might be enforced in court. But he had no idea how the White House files were organized, so he scheduled a meeting with the president&#x27;s counsel on June 6 to discuss his documents request.

The president&#x27;s new defense team was made up of one-time Democrat Leonard Garment, University of Texas constitutional law professor Charles Alan Wright, and Nixon true believer J. Fred Buzhardt. Cox made three requests: the Petersen document concerning his meeting with Nixon; Petersen&#x27;s memorandum to Haldeman summarizing the same meeting; and the tape of the conversation between Nixon and Dean mentioned by Petersen from the same meeting. Vorenberg added a request for all logs between the president and key aides from June 1972 to May 1973. Buzhardt said that only the president could determine what he would produce. Garment and Wright argued about executive privilege, which Wright said applied not only to presidential documents but ones of his aides such as Haldeman and Ehrlichman. As for the tape of the April 15 Dean meeting, Buzhardt (falsely) suggested it was not a tape &quot;of&quot; the meeting but rather the president&#x27;s later dictated tape &quot;about&quot; the meeting. No resolution was arrived at, but the president&#x27;s lawyers did not reject the requests outright.

The president&#x27;s legal team employed an approach that would become familiar: state an overly broad position, equivocate, delay, and then abruptly make partial concessions in the face of perceived popular disapproval. Shortly after their meeting, Cox announced a sudden press conference (unrelated to the discovery dispute). Buzhardt, thinking that Cox planned to go public with the dispute over the documents, called Vorenberg. Instead of discussing the press conference Vorenberg reminded Buzhardt of the documents requests. Buzhardt assured Vorenberg that a package would soon be delivered. Twenty minutes before the press conference, the package arrived containing the logs of presidential meetings and telephone conferences with key aides, including Dean, Haldeman, and Ehrlichman. The press conference took place and involved (as was originally planned) only an introduction to several new attorneys. The documents, however, together with the logs of Haldeman and Ehrlichman themselves proved essential to draft subpoenas sufficiently specific to elicit documents, and more crucially when their existence would later become known, the tapes.

By mid-June the office was fully functioning. Silbert&#x27;s U.S. attorney&#x27;s team was finally eased out on June 29, much to the chagrin of the federal prosecutors. The task force that was to show the first results was McBridge&#x27;s campaign finance group. On July 6, American Airlines admitted that it made an illegal $55,000 campaign contribution to Nixon&#x27;s personal lawyer Herb Kalmbach. Within two months the Special Prosecutor would uncover illegal contributions by Ashland Oil, Gulf Oil, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Phillips Petroleum, and Braniff Airlines. While the center of media attention was on the cover up, by January, according to a Harris survey, 81% of Americans believed &quot;illegal corporate money-givers&quot; were &quot;harmful to the country.&quot;

===White House tapes===
Herb Kalmbach, especially of interest to the illegal campaign contributions task force, was scheduled to testify before the Senate Watergate Committee on July 16. Instead, Haldeman&#x27;s aide Col. Alexander Butterfield was inserted as a &quot;mystery witness.&quot; During his 30-minute testimony he revealed the secret taping system that was installed in the Oval Office, the president&#x27;s office at the Executive Office Building, and at Camp David)—a voice-activated mechanism designed to capture everything spoken by or to the president. The existence of the tapes was the biggest piece of evidence unearthed by the Senate Watergate Committee; around it much of the remainder of the cover-up case would revolve.

The materiality of certain tapes was self-evident. Tapes of conversations testified to by John Dean would either show that Dean&#x27;s account was accurate, in which case the president was complicit in obstruction of justice, or false, in which case Dean committed perjury in his testimony to the Senate. The relevance of other tapes could be inferred from the proximity of meetings to Watergate-related events. Cox believed he could maximize his chance for a favorable ruling by limiting the scope of his initial request to material arguably important to the criminal proceedings. Once he obtained a ruling that executive privilege gave way to a compelling need in a criminal prosecution, he could ask for additional material later. So on July 18 Cox sent Buzhardt a written request for eight specific tapes. On July 23, Wright responded in writing denying the request on grounds of executive privilege and separation of powers. That evening Cox had a grand jury subpoena demanding the eight tapes and three other items served on Buzhardt who accepted on behalf of the president.

On July 26, Chief Judge John J. Sirica received a letter from Nixon himself responding to the subpoena in which he asserted that it would be as inappropriate for the court to compel him as it would for him to compel the court. He was therefore not producing the tapes. But he included a copy of the March 30 memo concerning Hunt&#x27;s employment and promised to make available the Strachan political documents concerning ambassadorships. Within an hour Cox was before the grand jury, explaining the response to them; they voted to request Sirica to issue an order to Nixon to show cause why there should not be prompt compliance with the subpoena. Sirica had the members individually polled and issued the order.

Sirica allowed the parties a month to brief the issue, which came for a hearing on August 22. Wright took a broad, absolutist position claiming the president was the only person who could decide what materials to turn over to them. He relayed Nixon&#x27;s feelings on national security, saying that Nixon told him that one tape had &quot;national security information so highly sensitive that he did not feel free to hint to me what the nature of it is&quot; despite Wright&#x27;s full national security clearance. Wright said that the president&#x27;s power was so inclusive that he could terminate the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s office and have all the cases dismissed. Cox, on his turn, emphasized the peculiar situation here where there &quot;is strong reason to believe the integrity of the executive office has been corrupted&quot; and pointed out that the president had permitted his staff to testify about the meetings covered by the tapes but refused to turn over the tapes themselves, which would be the better evidence of what transpired. As for the claim that the president could terminate his commission, Cox said (presciently in hindsight) that even if were true, then the president would have to accept the political repercussions that would follow exercising that power. After questioning Wright for about 17 minutes (and Cox only 8), the judge said he hoped to have a decision within a week.

On August 29, the court ordered the president to deliver all the material to him for review. The decision amounted to a rejection of Wright&#x27;s absolutist argument. Although not a complete victory for Cox, Sirica ignored the national security argument, and the decision was widely considered as historic—the first time a court ordered a president to produce evidence since Chief Justice John Marshall in 1807 ordered President Thomas Jefferson to produce documents. The White House quickly announced that Nixon &quot;will not comply with the order.&quot; Wright said that they were considering an appeal, but the statement &quot;hinted that they might find some other method of sustaining the president&#x27;s legal position.&quot;

The president did appeal, but to the public irritation of Wright, the Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the proceedings expedited, scheduling argument for the following week before the entire circuit. At the argument on September 11 Wright again took the maximum view of executive privilege. In response to a question by Chief Judge David L. Bazelon, Wright said that he could think of no circumstance that the tapes could be demanded by courts. He said, however, that the White House had made information available, waiving the privilege, but tapes constituted &quot;the raw material of life,&quot; something essentially privileged. Wright maintained that the privilege survived even if abused, such as by the president engaging in fraud or other crime. Cox&#x27;s approach, just as in the sit-in and reapportionment cases, was to avoid asserting a broad legal principle and instead show how the case was &quot;sui generis&quot;, unlikely to establish a precedent soon relied on, and one that fit easily within existing principles of administration of justice. Observers believed Cox had won. Instead, the Court&#x27;s decision two days later (even before the time the court had provided for post-argument briefs) gave the parties one week to come up with a compromise.

===Negotiations, grand jury progress, and the court&#x27;s decision===
The Circuit Court&#x27;s recommendation was that the parties come to an arrangement whereby the president would submit portions of the tapes to Cox and Wright who would decide with Nixon what portions would be submitted to the grand jury. Cox announced almost immediately that he was willing to discuss the matter with the White House lawyers. The White House would only say that it was studying the matter; Wright had already returned to Texas. The Court instructed the parties to report back within one week. If no arrangement could be made, it would decide the appeal.

Nixon had lost patience with Cox and was in no mood to negotiate (even though the court&#x27;s suggestion strongly implied that it would order production of the tapes if there was no settlement). While the lawyers engaged in delay, Nixon was trying to control Cox through Richardson. For three months, Alexander Haig, H.R. Haldeman&#x27;s replacement as White House chief of staff, had been directing Richardson to clamp down on Cox with increasingly more explicit threats until it reached the boiling point just at this moment. Buzhardt nevertheless made an offer: he would summarize the tapes with each participant&#x27;s conversations re-written in the third person. It was an unworkable scheme, but Cox decided to continue negotiations over the next several days. Cox then drafted a 6-page counter-proposal providing for transcriptions of the actual conversations together with a third-party certification that the rest of the tape was irrelevant. At the last meeting, when Nixon&#x27;s lawyers showed willingness to have a third party certify transcripts, Cox gave them his proposal and then left to give them a chance to consider it. In less than an hour Buzhardt called, rejecting the proposal and ending the negotiations. The parties informed the court that they could not reach agreement.

Aside from the tapes, the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s office was making substantial progress on all fronts. The Watergate task force was initially stymied in their case against John Dean. Dean&#x27;s lawyer made a compelling argument that the government could not proceed against him on the basis of the information he proffered during his plea negotiations with Silbert&#x27;s prosecutors. A court would require a showing that the evidence used by the government had an independent basis than that proffered by Dean. It took careful combing of the file to find a letter from one of the prosecutors to Dean&#x27;s lawyer noting that Dean had failed to inform them about two specific crimes that two other witnesses disclosed. Dean&#x27;s lawyer replied that the omission was an oversight. The two letters showed that there existed an independent basis to prosecute Dean. Jim Neal gave Dean until the third week of October to agree to plead to one felony count, with the obligation to become a prosecution witness, or else face indictment on the two separate incidents. The plea before Judge Sirica (known among the criminal bar as &quot;Maximum John&quot;) would certainly require prison time, but Dean would likely receive favorable consideration for a reduced sentence if he cooperated.

The other task forces were also proceeding apace. Connolly&#x27;s task force was readying perjury indictments: one involved former Attorney General Kleindienst who now admitted that in fact Nixon had ordered him to dismiss the ITT antitrust suit in consideration of ITT&#x27;s campaign contributions. The dirty tricks task force of Richard Davis obtained a plea of guilty by Donald Segretti to three counts of illegal campaign activity. It was now preparing a perjury indictment against Dwight Chapin. New information suggested an illegal contribution of $100,000 cash (in $100 bills) from Howard Hughes through Charles &quot;Bebe&quot; Rebozo to Nixon&#x27;s campaign. Inasmuch as Cox had to recuse himself from this case, he assigned it to McBride and authorized Ruth to make all decisions but asked for a prompt and diligent investigation. The Plumbers task force was considering how to trace the chain of authority in the Fielding break-in case, given their lack of a high-level cooperating witness, but they had ready perjury indictments against John Mitchell and Egil Krogh; Krogh would be indicted October 11. While most of this activity went unreported, people tapped into the network of defense attorneys and grand jury witnesses (including the White House) knew that the noose was being tightened around the president. One reporter told James Doyle that a &quot;middle-level White House guy told him on September 28: &quot;Over here they talk about how to get Cox all the time.&quot;

It was the Krogh indictment that forced Richardson to have another meeting with Cox on October 12. The break-in of Daniel Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist&#x27;s office was still claimed by the White House to involve national security matters, and Richardson and Cox had an agreement that Cox would notify the attorney general before any indictment in that matter was filed. Richardson wanted to know why he was not notified. Cox, surprised, explained that the agreement did not involve perjury indictments (which could not betray national security secrets, since they would involve public testimony). Richardson, checking his notes of their understanding, agreed with Cox and then apologized for forgetting that provision. He then had a bizarre conversation with Cox during which he said that soon he would have to &quot;push Cox,&quot; but that sometimes &quot;it&#x27;s better to lose your hat than your head.&quot; Perplexed, Cox returned to his office and was in the midst of telling Doyle of the conversation, when two lawyers interrupted to say the Circuit Court of Appeals had filed their decision just after 6 p.m.

The 5–2 decision of the Court of Appeals was an utter defeat for the president, and the papers highlighted the statement that the president was not &quot;above the law&#x27;s commands.&quot; The court modified Judge Sirica&#x27;s order and required Nixon&#x27;s lawyers to specify the grounds of any privilege they were claiming as to particular portions of the tape, and Cox was to be furnished with the specifications. Cox was also to be given access to the material in any instance when the Court was in doubt of the relevance to the criminal proceedings. In this case, the court said, &quot;any concern over confidentiality is minimized by the attorney general&#x27;s designation of a distinguished and reflective counsel as Special Prosecutor.&quot; In short, the court required disclosure except for portions that the president could articulate a particularized need for confidentiality, and Cox was permitted to see any portion where Sirica needed guidance on relevance.

===White House ultimatum===
Unlike its actions following the Sirica decision, the White House remained quiet that Friday night and through the weekend following the Court of Appeals ruling. Cox had no response until he met Richardson at 6:00 p.m. on Monday, October 15. Cox thought this meeting would be a continuation of the &quot;Byzantine&quot; conversation (as Cox called it) from the previous Friday, but instead Richardson appeared now to be the point man on negotiations over the tapes. Richardson gave an outline of a proposal to have Senator John Stennis authenticate transcripts of relevant portions of the tapes. Cox was able to infer that Richardson had gotten orders from the White House and was concerned that if a compromise was not reached one or both would be fired. During the 75-minute meeting, Cox asked a long list of questions, including where he would stand with respect to future demands for documents, tapes, or other material. Because he had an engagement, Richardson proposed they meet again in the morning. The next day Richardson told Cox that if they did not have an agreement by Friday &quot;the consequences will be very serious for both of us.&quot; Cox objected to the deadline, suggesting that if their talks continue they could easily get a postponement of any response due the court. Richardson could not explain why there was a deadline and instead wanted to go over the points they had agreed upon, then discuss other issues; but Cox insisted that it was an inefficient way to proceed and gave him his earlier 6-page proposal; and Richardson agreed to write a counter-proposal.
Cox did not hear from Richardson the rest of Tuesday or Wednesday. There was much disagreement in the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s office whether Cox should accept the proposal at all. Much of the concern had to do with Senator Stennis, a Nixon supporter, but more importantly a frail, partially deaf 72-year-old who only recently had recovered from a near fatal gunshot wound in a mugging in January. Cox was worried that rejecting a deal would risk obtaining anything from the White House. James Neal cautioned that if he rejected a compromise a large part of the country might accuse him of acting like a &quot;super-president&quot; without any checks. Doyle had the opposite concern: if Cox accepted less than the tapes, which the court ordered turned over, he might be seen as part of the cover-up. James Neal had a suggestion to minimize the Stennis problem—have him appointed by the court as one of several special masters. In that way he could obtain assistance in a publicly regulated manner. In the midst of the internal debate word came in the afternoon of Wednesday, October 17, that Judge Sirica dismissed the suit of the Senate Watergate Committee against Nixon seeking the tapes. Sirica ruled that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. It left the Special Prosecutor as the only means by which the tapes could be made public. Pressure on Cox to seek the material increased, while the White House was left with only one avenue to block it and so had added incentive to pressure Richardson to get Cox either to compromise or resign.

At 5:00 p.m. Richardson hand-delivered to Cox a draft entitled &quot;A Proposal&quot;, which contained the Buzhardt comments. He called Cox at 6:00 for his comments. Cox replied: &quot;I think I should respond in writing, Elliot.&quot; That night James Neal and Dean&#x27;s lawyer worked past midnight finalizing John Dean&#x27;s plea agreement. At about 2:30 a.m. Neal had the lawyer review with Dean the agreement, including the provision that if any testimony he had already given proved materially false, he could be prosecuted for perjury. Neal said that when Dean agreed to the plea deal containing that proviso, he knew that Dean&#x27;s version of the events was truthful and he also realized that &quot;Archibald Cox was in serious trouble with the president.&quot;

On Thursday, October 18, Cox drafted an 11-point reply to Richardson. Cox assured Richardson that he was &quot;not unamenable&quot; to a solution in which he had no direct access to the tapes. But he felt that it was unfair to depend on one individual to be responsible for verification, so he proposed Neal&#x27;s idea of three &quot;Special Masters&quot; whose identities were disclosed from the start. He commented on the method for determining what portions would be transcribed and suggested that the tapes be subject to analysis for tampering. The comments went by messenger at mid-afternoon. Richardson around 6 p.m. brought it to the White House, where Wright had just returned from Texas (to finalize the appeal papers to the Supreme Court that were due the following day), and although he had just reviewed the &quot;Stennis proposal,&quot; he was enthusiastically extolling its reasonableness and holding forth on how the president could convince the American people that it was the solution to the crisis. When shown the Cox counter-proposal, he was outraged that Cox had &quot;rejected&quot; the president&#x27;s offer. Wright counseled rejection of Cox&#x27;s counteroffer since he believed the president had a &quot;50–50 chance&quot; in the Supreme Court to win outright. Richardson, perplexed at the opposition to negotiating with Cox, suggested to Wright: &quot;Charlie, why don&#x27;t you call Archie and see if you can sell it to him.&quot; That night Wright called Cox and was routed to the phone in Cox&#x27;s brother&#x27;s home in Virginia, where Cox was having dinner and playing with his brother&#x27;s children. Wright gave Cox an ultimatum with four points, the most important of which was that Cox would be given no more tapes beyond the nine that were being transcribed (a condition not in the Stennis proposal). Cox asked that Wright send the points to him in writing so that he could consider them the next day and assured him that he was not rejecting the points outright.

At 8:30 a.m. on Friday October 19, the day of Nixon&#x27;s deadline for appealing to the Supreme Court (otherwise the Court of Appeals decision would become final), Cox received a letter from Wright dated the previous night. It purported to confirm Cox&#x27;s &quot;rejection&quot; of Richardson&#x27;s &quot;very reasonable proposal.&quot; There was no mention of the four conditions. He wrote that he would telephone at 10:00 a.m. to find out if there was any reason to continue talking. Cox, who until then had publicly and privately spoken of the integrity of Wright, told his colleagues: &quot;very clever lies.&quot; Cox wrote a note to Wright saying that the proposal needed &quot;fleshing out,&quot; particularly in light of the conditions Wright had set out in the phone call the previous night, which Cox put in writing for the record. He, Neal, and others then left for Sirica&#x27;s courtroom to attend the plea hearing on John Dean. The White House, seeing only that a hearing had been scheduled, panicked, not knowing what was to take place; no attorney was present when Ruth and Lacovara arrived to deliver the letter and they left it with the guard. Haig quickly learned of the letter, told Richardson that Cox &quot;rejected&quot; the deal, and summoned him to the White House. To Richardson&#x27;s surprise, Haig said that it was no longer necessary to fire Cox because the president had gotten bipartisan approval for the deal, there were meetings with the two leading members of the Senate Watergate Committee scheduled, and the plan would be acceptable to both the American people and the courts.

The guilty plea by John Dean (with obligation to cooperate) that morning represented the most significant step so far in the prosecutions. Yet, when Cox returned to the office it remained quiet—Wright had neither called nor responded in writing. When the courts closed, there was still no sign that the president had filed a notice to appeal to the Supreme Court. At 5:23 p.m. a letter from Wright arrived, which simply again maintained the reasonableness of the original proposal. Wright closed with a statement of regret that Cox would not agree. Cox now realized that he and Richardson had been allowed to negotiate even though the president had no intention to go beyond the inadequate first proposal. On this conclusion, the lawyers in the office began copying their most important memos for safe keeping. At 7:20 Richardson phoned Cox at home and read him a letter he just received from Wright informing him the Stennis plan had been agreed to by the leadership of the Senate Watergate Committee and that Cox would be instructed to not pursue any further presidential material. A statement was to be released that night. Cox and Doyle hurried back to the office. When they obtained the statement they saw it as an attempt to sell the unilateral proposal; it claimed that the plan had the approval of Senators Sam Ervin and Howard Baker, who, the statement falsely said, were the ones who proposed Senator Stennis. Although Cox had refused to agree, Nixon planned to take the proposal to Sirica and instructed his lawyers not to seek Supreme Court review. Given that the statement was riddled with falsehoods, Cox that night dictated a press release to Doyle (the staff had gone off for the three-day weekend), and Doyle phoned it in to the wire services, also announcing there would be a press conference on Saturday, at 1:00 p.m.

===Saturday Night Massacre===

Doyle was able to use his press contacts to secure the ballroom of the National Press Club for the 1:00 p.m. press conference on Saturday, October 20. It was to be broadcast live on NBC and CBS and a summary would be shown during half-time of the football game being shown on ABC. Cox that morning was quite concerned about whether he would be able to take the president on alone. He was well aware that he had no institutional support, and the apparent defection of Sam Ervin of the Senate Watergate Committee profoundly troubled him. &quot;Spineless!&quot; he remarked on reading of it. He was also concerned about lack of political support. Just six days before Senator George McGovern had told the ACLU, which had just taken out newspaper ads calling for Nixon&#x27;s impeachment, that there was not yet support for it; in fact, there was not even enough strength in the opposition to override vetoes. As for Nixon&#x27;s statement itself, influential members seemed behind it: Republican Senate minority leader Hugh Scott called it a &quot;very wise solution.&quot; Democratic Speaker Carl Albert characterized it, noncommitally, as &quot;interesting.&quot; Even Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield said it was a way &quot;to avoid a constitutional confrontation.&quot; When Joseph Connolly called an aide to liberal Republican Senator Richard Schweiker, he was told that the senator &quot;can&#x27;t get out front on this.&quot; At the office, the lawyer staff assembled to discuss the matter as a group for the first time. Philip Heymann had flown in from Cambridge to lend support. They offered contradictory advice, and Cox asked them to go to their offices to write up suggestions for him. At 11:00 a.m. he met them again and gave something of a valedictory and urged them to continue working if he were fired. At 12:30, Cox, Phyllis, James Doyle, and John Barker walked to the National Press Club. &quot;He was plenty upset,&quot; said Barker.
Richardson was on the phone when Cox arrived and read to him the text of a letter he had sent to the president that day in which he said that Nixon&#x27;s instructions gave him &quot;serious difficulties&quot; and outlined several steps that still might save the compromise. Phyllis, holding his hand, walked him to the stage, where they were photographed. Cox then sat down at the table and began his impromptu remarks.

Heymann thought he started out nervous, defensively saying that he was &quot;not out to get the president …&quot; Once he got into the details of the history and significance of the dispute over the tapes, which involved a patient explanation of criminal procedure, evidence, administrative and constitutional law, he relaxed. Doyle said: &quot;He was folksy, unpretentious, disarming. He seemed the country lawyer, talking good sense.&quot; While he used simple terms and short sentences, he was not patronizing or supercilious. &quot;He offered a masterful professorial performance, designed to explain the legal and constitutional confrontation in terms that struck at the core of the layman&#x27;s treasured values essential to the American system.&quot; He defended established institutions and regular procedure. By contrast, the president&#x27;s proposal involved deciding that a &quot;court order would not be obeyed.&quot; In the place of evidence, which Cox sought, the president proposed providing &quot;summaries&quot; while the genuine, irrefutable evidence, the tapes of what actually transpired, would be available to only two or three men, &quot;all but one of them the aides to the president and men who have been associated with those who are the subject of the investigation.&quot; In describing the course of the negotiations for all information, he showed how the White House lawyers had stalled from the beginning. But he never attacked anyone, at one point taking Buzhardt off the hook: &quot;he has behaved in dealing with me in an entirely honorable way —except that he&#x27;s too damn slow.&quot; With the questions that followed, Cox spent more than an hour, at the end of which his staff handed out copies of the various proposals and correspondence that took place during the week. It was so persuasive a performance that Sarah McClendon, White House correspondent known for her sharp questions, approached Cox and said: &quot;I want to shake your hand, you are a great American.&quot; Doyle wrote that it was &quot;the most unusual press conference I have ever attended. The hard-bitten, cynical press corps was rooting for Archibald Cox.&quot; John Douglas said: &quot;It was one of the most spectacular performances, one of two or three press conference ever held in this country which have had a significant effect on public opinion.&quot;

The press conference also unravelled the Nixon-Haig plan. Cox did not resign, nor was he cowed by the president&#x27;s directive. Moreover, instead of exploiting Richardson&#x27;s reputation for integrity to his own advantage (a key feature on which the plan was based), the president was forced to act in his own name, and Cox was able to draw Richardson to his side by defending him as honorable. So the White House decided to fire Cox. It was unable, however, to make either Richardson or his deputy William Ruckelshaus carry out the order. Each resigned in turn rather than fire Cox, although the White House later claimed it fired Ruckelshaus. Solicitor General Robert Bork (third in line at the Justice Department) in a face-to-face meeting with the president agreed to issue the order as the acting attorney general and he also decided not to resign after so doing. As for the termination itself, Bork sent a written order to Cox by messenger that evening to Cox&#x27;s home.

The White House then fatally overplayed its hand. At 8:25 p.m. press secretary Ron Ziegler announced what would become known as the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre.&quot; He explained that Cox had been fired, but added, somewhat gratuitously (and, as it would ultimately transpire, inaccurately), &quot;the office of the Special Prosecution Force has been abolished as of approximately 8 P.M. tonight.&quot; Haig compounded the bad publicity by publicly sealing the offices of the Special Prosecutor as well as those of Richardson and Ruckelshaus. He explained his conduct by saying: &quot;You would turn the country into a banana republic if you allowed defiance of the president.&quot; To Judge Sirica, who watched it on television, it was the cordoning off of the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s offices that looked like part of a Latin American coup. Fred Emery wrote for the &quot;Times of London&quot; that there was &quot;a whiff of the Gestapo in the chill October air.&quot; FBI agents showed up at the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s offices at 9:00 p.m. and briefly prevented deputy prosecutor Henry Ruth from entering. Staffers inside were told they were not permitted to remove any documents, official or personal. At a hastily arranged press conference in the library of the building, Ruth and Doyle explained that they had taken copies of major memos to a safe place the night before, but that they were concerned about the vast amount of material still in the office that had not been presented to the grand jury. Doyle read Cox&#x27;s statement on his termination: &quot;Whether we shall continue to be a Government of laws and not of men is now for Congress and ultimately the American people.&quot;
The actions of Nixon and his aides that night produced &quot;results precisely the opposite to what the president and his lawyers had anticipated.&quot; Instead of simply removing Cox, &quot;they raised a &#x27;firestorm&#x27; of protest that permanently scarred Nixon&#x27;s credibility with the public, and, most damagingly, with Congressional Republicans and Southern Democrats.&quot; Public reaction, even though it was a holiday weekend, was swift and overwhelming. About 450,000 telegrams and cables reached the White House and Congress. Mail and wires were put in bundles then sorted by state. The deluge eclipsed any previous record. Outside the White House, marchers held signs saying &quot;Honk for Impeachment&quot;; car horns were heard in downtown Washington day and night for two weeks. But more concerning to the White House must have been the political reaction. On Sunday John B. Anderson, Chairman of the House Republican Conference, predicted that &quot;impeachment resolutions are going to be raining down like hailstorms.&quot; George H. W. Bush, then Chairman of the Republican National Committee, was so concerned over the electoral consequences that he visited the White House, hoping to persuade the president to rehire Richardson for damage control, perhaps as ambassador to the U.S.S.R. On Tuesday, Speaker Carl Albert began referring impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Committee with the consent of Gerald Ford. Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment said that the White House was paralyzed. &quot;[H]e thought of little else except to marvel &#x27;over the mischief we had wrought and the public relations disaster we had brought on ourselves.&#x27;&quot;

In the end, Nixon did not even achieve the short-term tactical benefit the maneuver was designed to afford him. On Tuesday afternoon eleven lawyers from the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s force convened with Wright and Buzhardt in the courtroom of Judge Sirica, for further proceedings on the subpoenas. That weekend Sirica drafted an order to show cause why Nixon should not be held in contempt. He was thinking of a $25,000 to $50,000 a day fine until the president complied. To everyone&#x27;s amazement, Wright announced that the president was prepared to produce all the material ordered. Not long afterward, Leon Jaworski would be appointed Special Prosecutor and, because of Nixon&#x27;s wounded public standing, was given even more independence than Cox had. Cox would not be part of any of it, however, for after a brief farewell meeting with his staff (whom Jaworski would keep), advising them how important it was that they continue and assuring them of Jaworski&#x27;s good faith, he and Phyllis drove off in their pickup truck to their place in Brooksville, Maine.

Cox&#x27;s colleague and friend Philip Heymann described the effect of that weekend from Cox&#x27;s address, through the massacre and the reaction:
Cox&#x27;s case on the tapes did not go to the Supreme Court, but when the president tried to resist a later subpoena by Jaworski, the case made its way to the Court. On July 24, 1974, only three days after oral argument, United States Supreme Court voted by 8 to 0 to reject Nixon&#x27;s claims of executive privilege and enforced the subpoena requiring the release of the tapes. Fifteen days later Nixon announced his decision to resign as president effective the next day, August 8, 1974. Many legal experts outside of the United States were shocked at how legal process, particularly one issued at the request of a subordinate official, could require the head of state to do anything. Cox wrote of one scholar who said: &quot;It is &quot;unthinkable&quot; that the courts of any country should issue an order to its Chief of State.&quot; Cox spent much of the rest of his career writing on the unique place of the Court in the American system of government. As for this particular case, when it was all over, &quot;Times&quot; legal correspondent Anthony Lewis gave chief credit for the extraordinary result to Cox: 
==After Watergate==

===Teaching again===
Cox spent the academic year from September 1974 to spring 1975 at the University of Cambridge as the Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions. During that year Cox and his wife were able to travel throughout Britain and Ireland meeting judges, lawyers and other dignitaries. Cox lectured to packed houses, including at Oxford where he delivered the Chichele Lectures at All Souls College. The Coxes also occasionally socialized with the Richardsons, Elliot having been appointed by President Ford as the Ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s. They were even able to spend a weekend in Scotland with David Graham-Campbell, the commander of the corps that Cox&#x27;s brother Robert served in when he died during World War II.

When Cox returned to Harvard in the fall of 1975 he returned to teaching and writing full-time. His interests were now almost exclusively constitutional law, but he occasionally would teach a course in labor law. Faculty members and students noticed a change in his style of teaching. Whereas once he was known as the austere, dominating law professor drilling students with the Socratic method, and even was considered a possible basis for the fictional Professor Kingsfield, he was now referred to in student evaluations as &quot;interesting, kind, decent.&quot; Derek Bok concluded: &quot;He developed an affection for people.&quot;

===Judicial reform===
Cox&#x27;s outside activities shifted from arbitration to government reform and appellate advocacy. In 1975, court reform was a top priority in Massachusetts where criminal cases had backlogged the system, which (because they required priority) resulted in even greater congestion of civil cases. Cox was appointed to a Massachusetts Bar committee to study the problem. in February 1976 Governor Michael Dukakis appointed Cox to head the 20 member Governor&#x27;s Select Committee on Judicial Needs to make recommendations. In December the committee issued the Cox-drafted report, entitled &quot;Report on the State of the Massachusetts Court.&quot; The Report&#x27;s most important recommendations were a structuring of the District Courts, state assumption of the administrative costs of the courts, placing management of the court system in the hands of the chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, abolition of trials &quot;de novo&quot; in appeals from the District Court and tightening of the rules for remand and continuances. Despite the fact that the Governor made judicial reform along the lines of the Cox report his &quot;top&quot; legislative priority for 1976, and despite the fact that the proposal was supported by the newspapers of the state, and despite intense lobbying efforts by Cox himself (not only in testimony before the legislatures but also in numerous speaking events throughout the state) over the course of 1976, the legislation ultimately ran out of time in the 1977 legislative session. In the next session the bill was drastically revised, but ultimately retained the state take-over of funding and implemented some centralization and coordination.

===Supreme Court advocate===
Just as his public support for Udall was uncharacteristic, after Watergate Cox was more open to represent groups not a part of traditional institutions. But Cox&#x27;s chief interest was always in Supreme Court advocacy. And he would argue two more landmark cases.

The first of the cases arose out of the 1974 amendments of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. These amendments were a response to the campaign finance abuses of Nixon&#x27;s Committee for the Re-Election of the President, which Cox was familiar with as Special Watergate Prosecutor. The amendments provided for financial reporting by federal campaigns, established a variety of contribution and spending limitations and provided for public funding of presidential campaigns. A variety of plaintiffs sued, claiming the regulatory scheme violated their right to free speech. In 1975 the case reached the Supreme Court, and Senators Edward Kennedy and Hugh Scott requested Cox to file an &quot;amicus&quot; brief on their behalf. Common Cause had intervened as a party in the lower court and therefore had time a right to argue before the Court, but its counsel Lloyd Cutler disagreed with the position taken by the organization (which supported the amendments) and Cox was asked to argue on its behalf.

Cox&#x27;s key argument was that the contribution of money, even when done to enable public discourse is not &quot;speech&quot; but rather &quot;conduct.&quot; Nor was total campaign spending, even though part of it was used to enable &quot;speech.&quot; In light of the realities of escalating campaign contributions, Congress had a right to regulate this conduct to reduce corruption and to counter public cynicism in the electoral process. Cox argued that such conduct should be subject to a lesser standard of court review than the strict scrutiny of restrictions on pure political speech. The Court&#x27;s decision in the case, known as &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot;, was an eclectic array of separate opinions on various parts of the amendments, with only a brief &quot;per curiam&quot; decision tallying the votes on each issue. The Court rejected Cox&#x27;s approach. As Justice White put it in dissent, the Court held that &#x27;money talks&quot; without considering the variety of ways that federal laws regulate speech in other contexts. Nevertheless, while it voided limits on campaign spending, it upheld contribution limits, financial reporting requirements and the conditions to financing of presidential campaigns. John W. Gardner, the chairman of Common Cause called it a victory for those who &quot;worked so hard to clean up politics in this country.&quot;

The second significant case Cox participated in dealt with affirmative action. In 1976 the California Supreme Court had ruled that the University of California, Davis Medical School had violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by failing to admit Allan Bakke, a 37-year-old white engineering student, who claimed that he was barred by a &quot;racial quota.&quot; The trustees sought out Cox to argue the case in the Supreme Court. Cox, who had already prepared a brief on the issue in the &quot;DeFunis&quot; case, agreed to take the case on the condition that other lawyers take primary responsibility for preparing the brief, something highly unusual for Cox who normally carefully supervised and revised anything that went to the Court under his name, but necessary because of the work involved on the Massachusetts court reform committee. When the case came on to be argued, on October 12, 1977, Cox was in the midst of his heaviest schedule yet of lobbying for the reform bill, with the legislative session over after the holidays. The crux of his argument was to separate two questions facing universities who had fewer places available than qualified candidates: 1) Which candidates are capable of benefiting from the education provided by the school? and 2) From that group, what characteristics can the school employ to make sure a class benefits itself, the school and the community? It is the confusion of the two questions that gives rise to the claim that a &quot;quota&quot; exists.

Cox opened his &quot;Bakke&quot; argument by stating these questions in a way that put the case at its most forceful; namely, that unless the Court permitted universities to take race into account to promote minority participation in learned professions, they would be excluded except for a very small number. The case, known as &quot;Regents of the University of California v. Bakke&quot; produced several opinions: four justices opined that taking race into account was never permissible; four, on the other hand, that it was permissible if &quot;benign.&quot; Justice Lewis Powell, whose plurality opinion was joined by the different groups in different parts, tried to thread the needle. While he rejected a fixed number of acceptances (a so-called &quot;quota&quot;), and thus affirmed Bakke&#x27;s admission in this case, he also answered Cox&#x27;s framing of the question in the affirmative and said that universities are entitled to take race into account as one factor among many. Assistant Attorney General Drew S. Days, III, who watched the argument felt that Cox&#x27;s presence was crucial as a symbol of the &quot;establishment&quot; assuring the Court (and the conservative Justice Powell) that the position was not &quot;outlandish.&quot; Powell&#x27;s approach opinion underlies the approach of most university affirmative actions policies today.

===Judicial politics===
In late 1978 a new seat became available in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (the federal appellate court sitting in Boston) when Congress expanded the federal judiciary by 152 judges. Observers expected Senator Kennedy to avail himself of the tradition allowing the Senator of the president&#x27;s political party to name federal judges in his state to propose Archibald Cox. In March 1979 a panel of lawyers appointed by President Carter unanimously recommended Cox as their first choice among five for the nomination. Cox was highly doubtful, however, that Carter would appoint him in light of his prominent support of Udall three years earlier, but nevertheless filled out the application and submitted to background checks. Then in June the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the nomination was &quot;stalled.&quot; Some anonymous sources claimed that Attorney General Griffin Bell objected to the nomination on the ground that Cox at 67 was too old, noting that the ABA suggested that no one over 64 be named to the job. Another suggested that behind this rationale was antagonisms between Bell and Cox dating back to when Cox was Solicitor General and Bell was an appellate court judge in the south. Another source said that the Justice Department was holding up the appointment because Kennedy was attempting to assert undue influence as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who had the ability to block appointments across the country. Publicly, however, all the parties insisted that the delay was nothing out of the ordinary.

Within the White House Cox had his defenders who argued strongly against the &quot;rule of 64&quot; and even obtained an opinion that the ABA would not object to Cox&#x27;s appointment. Kennedy even spoke personally to Carter, urging that the appointment would redound to the president&#x27;s political benefit, but Carter told him he would not appoint Cox. When the decision was made members of Carter&#x27;s own judicial selection publicly expressed their anger over the decision. Carter&#x27;s 1976 New York campaign manager listed the failure to appoint Cox as one of several ways in which the Administration had &quot;behaved foolishly&quot; simply to snub Kennedy. The following year another panel assembled by Carter asked Cox if he wished again to apply for a judgeship. Cox quickly turned down offer of interest. His colleague Stephen Breyer obtained the appointment.

===Common Cause===
His judicial ambitions over, Cox turned his energies to leading outside advocacy and policy-making groups. In 1980 Cox was elected chairman of Common Cause, the 230,000 member citizens&#x27; lobby, as John Gardner&#x27;s successor. Cox wrote that &quot;[t]he challenge was to reshape the machinery of self-government … so that every citizen knows that he or she can participate and that his or her participation counts ... .&quot; That same year he also became the founding chairman of the Health Effects Institute, a partnership between the Environmental Protection Agency and private automobile and truck manufacturers to study the effects of emissions from motor vehicles. Cox said that the organization was designed to take the testing and scientific research concerning the health effects of this type of pollution &quot;out of the adversarial context.&quot;

It was as head of Common Cause, however, that he was to make his final mark; his goal was to make government more transparent and responsible to the broad public rather than special interests in order to restore faith in government institutions. The very day he took office, the Abscam affair was leaked. While Cox personally deplored the leak, he immediately sent letters to congressional leaders underlining &quot;the urgent necessity of looking into the charges to demonstrate that Congress is concerned about its honor and integrity.&quot; In July 1980 the organization instituted its first major litigation under Cox, and it was a follow-up on &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot;: Common Cause sued the four &quot;independent&quot; groups that promised to spend between $38 and $58 million for television and print advertisements in support of the election of Ronald Reagan, even though he agreed to abide by spending limits of $29.4 million as part of the agreement he made in accepting public financing. Right to work groups used the occasion to criticize Cox for attacking voluntary independent expenditures while ignoring union efforts on behalf of candidates. The D.C. District Court dismissed the case on the ground that any restrictions on &quot;independent&quot; spending amounted to an unconstitutional abridgment of freedom of speech. The Supreme Court, affirmed the decision by an equally divided court (Justice O&#x27;Connor not participating). That case would be Cox&#x27;s last argument before the Supreme Court.

Conservatives&#x27; complaints against Common Cause became more general and more numerous from that summer to fall when the organization celebrated its tenth anniversary. Henry Fairlie published in the June issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; a broad (but largely unspecific) complaint against the organization for representing all that was wrong with American politics: &quot;The underlying thrust of Common Cause reforms has been to weaken the political role of the very associations that give power to the otherwise powerless, and in the name of this misguided notion of participatory democracy Common Cause increases the opportunities of the already influential to extend their privileges.&quot; Tom Bethell (Washington editor of Harper&#x27;s) wrote in the &quot;Times&quot; &quot; The concept of &#x27;reform&#x27; itself is beginning to be viewed with skepticism. Writers are more and more inclined to put the word inside quotation marks. In Washington these days, one often hears references to &#x27;the unintended consequences of reform. Cox responded in an address on September 6, 1980: It was not reforms that were the problem, but rather incomplete implementation of them. The flood of money into national political campaigns was not the result of campaign finance reform, but of inadequate regulation of &quot;independent&quot; committees that informally coordinated with the campaigns. &quot;[D]amaging and dangerous as the rising rate of influence of political action committee contributions is … the present law is clearly preferable to the old pre-Watergate conditions.&quot;

Cox continued his campaign against large campaign contributions, but he was largely unsuccessful in effecting any further change. He also supported efforts to increase voter participation by testifying in favor of bilingual ballots

After twelve years at the helm, Cox, at 79, chose to retire from the chairmanship of Common Cause as of February 1992.

===Retirement===
Having taught for two years beyond Harvard&#x27;s mandatory retirement age, Cox was finally forced to retire from the Harvard Law School faculty at the end of the 1983–84 school year. Cox wryly said: &quot;I won&#x27;t be allowed to teach anymore. I&#x27;m presumed to be senile.&quot; He then accepted a teaching position at Boston University School of Law, which arranged a specific retirement policy for Cox; according to Dean Ronald A. Cass: &quot;He teaches as long as he wants to.&quot;

==Death==
Cox died at his home in Brooksville, Maine, of natural causes on May 29, 2004 at 92. He and his wife, Phyllis, had been married for 67 years; the couple had two daughters and a son. Phyllis died on February 6, 2007.

<text>In solid-state physics and solid-state chemistry, a band gap, also called a bandgap or energy gap, is an energy range in a solid where no electronic states exist. In graphs of the electronic band structure of solids, the band gap refers to the energy difference (often expressed in electronvolts) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in insulators and semiconductors. It is the energy required to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. The resulting conduction-band electron (and the electron hole in the valence band) are free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as charge carriers to conduct electric current. It is closely related to the HOMO/LUMO gap in chemistry. If the valence band is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty, then electrons cannot move within the solid because there are no available states. If the electrons are not free to move within the crystal lattice, then there is no generated current due to no net charge carrier mobility. However, if some electrons transfer from the valence band (mostly full) to the conduction band (mostly empty), then current &quot;can&quot; flow (see carrier generation and recombination). Therefore, the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid. Substances having large band gaps (also called &quot;wide&quot; band gaps) are generally insulators, those with small band gaps (also called &quot;narrow&quot; band gaps) are semiconductors, and conductors either have very small band gaps or none, because the valence and conduction bands overlap to form a continuous band. 

It is possible to produce laser induced insulator-metal transitions which have already been experimentally observed in some condensed matter systems, like thin films of , doped manganites, or in vanadium sesquioxide . These are special cases of the more general metal-to-nonmetal transitions phenomena which were intensively studied in the last decades. A one-dimensional analytic model of laser induced distortion of band structure was presented for a spatially periodic (cosine) potential. This problem is periodic both in space and time and can be solved analytically using the Kramers-Henneberger co-moving frame. The solutions can be given with the help of the Mathieu functions.

==In semiconductor physics==

Every solid has its own characteristic energy-band structure. This variation in band structure is responsible for the wide range of electrical characteristics observed in various materials.
Depending on the dimension, the band structure and spectroscopy can vary. The different types of dimensions are as listed: one dimension, two dimensions, and three dimensions.

In semiconductors and insulators, electrons are confined to a number of bands of energy, and forbidden from other regions because there are no allowable electronic states for them to occupy. The term &quot;band gap&quot; refers to the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. Electrons are able to jump from one band to another. However, in order for a valence band electron to be promoted to the conduction band, it requires a specific minimum amount of energy for the transition. This required energy is an intrinsic characteristic of the solid material. Electrons can gain enough energy to jump to the conduction band by absorbing either a phonon (heat) or a photon (light).

A semiconductor is a material with an intermediate-sized, non-zero band gap that behaves as an insulator at T=0K, but allows thermal excitation of electrons into its conduction band at temperatures that are below its melting point. In contrast, a material with a large band gap is an insulator. In conductors, the valence and conduction bands may overlap, so there is no longer a bandgap with forbidden regions of electronic states.

The conductivity of intrinsic semiconductors is strongly dependent on the band gap. The only available charge carriers for conduction are the electrons that have enough thermal energy to be excited across the band gap and the electron holes that are left off when such an excitation occurs.

Band-gap engineering is the process of controlling or altering the band gap of a material by controlling the composition of certain semiconductor alloys, such as GaAlAs, InGaAs, and InAlAs. It is also possible to construct layered materials with alternating compositions by techniques like molecular-beam epitaxy. These methods are exploited in the design of heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), laser diodes and solar cells.

The distinction between semiconductors and insulators is a matter of convention. One approach is to think of semiconductors as a type of insulator with a narrow band gap. Insulators with a larger band gap, usually greater than 4 eV, are not considered semiconductors and generally do not exhibit semiconductive behaviour under practical conditions. Electron mobility also plays a role in determining a material&#x27;s informal classification.

The band-gap energy of semiconductors tends to decrease with increasing temperature. When temperature increases, the amplitude of atomic vibrations increase, leading to larger interatomic spacing. The interaction between the lattice phonons and the free electrons and holes will also affect the band gap to a smaller extent. The relationship between band gap energy and temperature can be described by Varshni&#x27;s empirical expression (named after Y. P. Varshni),
: formula_1, where &quot;Eg&quot;(0), α and β are material constants.

Furthermore, lattice vibrations increase with temperature, which increases the effect of electron scattering. Additionally, the number of charge carriers within a semiconductor will increase, as more carriers have the energy required to cross the band-gap threshold and so conductivity of semiconductors also increases with increasing temperature. The external pressure also influences the electronic structure of semiconductors and, therefore, their optical band gaps.

In a regular semiconductor crystal, the band gap is fixed owing to continuous energy states. In a quantum dot crystal, the band gap is size dependent and can be altered to produce a range of energies between the valence band and conduction band. It is also known as quantum confinement effect.

Band gaps can be either direct or indirect, depending on the electronic band structure of the material.

It was mentioned earlier that the dimensions have different band structure and spectroscopy. For non-metallic solids, which are one dimensional, have optical properties that are dependent on the electronic transitions between valence and conduction bands. In addition, the spectroscopic transition probability is between the initial and final orbital and it depends on the integral. φi is the initial orbital, φf is the final orbital, ʃ φf*ûεφi is the integral, ε is the electric vector, and u is the dipole moment.

Two-dimensional structures of solids behave because of the overlap of atomic orbitals. The simplest two-dimensional crystal contains identical atoms arranged on a square lattice. Energy splitting occurs at the Brillouin zone edge for one-dimensional situations because of a weak periodic potential, which produces a gap between bands. The behavior of the one-dimensional situations does not occur for two-dimensional cases because there are extra freedoms of motion. Furthermore, a bandgap can be produced with strong periodic potential for two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases.

===Direct and indirect band gap===

Based on their band structure, materials are characterised with a direct band gap or indirect band gap. In the free-electron model, k is the momentum of a free electron and assumes unique values within the Brillouin zone that outlines the periodicity of the crystal lattice. If the momentum of the lowest energy state in the conduction band and the highest energy state of the valence band of a material have the same value, then the material has a direct bandgap. If they are not the same, then the material has an indirect band gap and the electronic transition must undergo momentum transfer to satisfy conservation. Such indirect &quot;forbidden&quot; transitions still occur, however at very low probabilities and weaker energy. For materials with a direct band gap, valence electrons can be directly excited into the conduction band by a photon whose energy is larger than the bandgap. In contrast, for materials with an indirect band gap, a photon and phonon must both be involved in a transition from the valence band top to the conduction band bottom, involving a momentum change. Therefore, direct bandgap materials tend to have stronger light emission and absorption properties and tend to be better suited for photovoltaics (PVs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and laser diodes; however, indirect bandgap materials are frequently used in PVs and LEDs when the materials have other favorable properties.

===Light-emitting diodes and laser diodes===

LEDs and laser diodes usually emit photons with energy close to and slightly larger than the band gap of the semiconductor material from which they are made. Therefore, as the band gap energy increases, the LED or laser color changes from infrared to red, through the rainbow to violet, then to UV.

===Photovoltaic cells===

The optical band gap (see below) determines what portion of the solar spectrum a photovoltaic cell absorbs. Strictly, a semiconductor will not absorb photons of energy less than the band gap; whereas most of the photons with energies exceeding the band gap will generate heat. Neither of them contribute to the efficiency of a solar cell. One way to circumvent this problem is based on the so-called photon management concept, in which case the solar spectrum is modified to match the absorption profile of the solar cell.

===List of band gaps===
Below are band gap values for some selected materials. For a comprehensive list of band gaps in semiconductors, see List of semiconductor materials.

==Optical versus electronic bandgap==
In materials with a large exciton binding energy, it is possible for a photon to have just barely enough energy to create an exciton (bound electron–hole pair), but not enough energy to separate the electron and hole (which are electrically attracted to each other). In this situation, there is a distinction between &quot;optical band gap&quot; and &quot;electronic band gap&quot; (or &quot;transport gap&quot;). The optical bandgap is the threshold for photons to be absorbed, while the transport gap is the threshold for creating an electron–hole pair that is &quot;not&quot; bound together. The optical bandgap is at lower energy than the transport gap.

In almost all inorganic semiconductors, such as silicon, gallium arsenide, etc., there is very little interaction between electrons and holes (very small exciton binding energy), and therefore the optical and electronic bandgap are essentially identical, and the distinction between them is ignored. However, in some systems, including organic semiconductors and single-walled carbon nanotubes, the distinction may be significant.

==Band gaps for other quasi-particles==
In photonics, band gaps or stop bands are ranges of photon frequencies where, if tunneling effects are neglected, no photons can be transmitted through a material. A material exhibiting this behaviour is known as a photonic crystal. The concept of hyperuniformity has broadened the range of photonic band gap materials, beyond photonic crystals. By applying the technique in supersymmetric quantum mechanics, a new class of optical disordered materials has been suggested, which support band gaps perfectly equivalent to those of crystals or quasicrystals.

Similar physics applies to phonons in a phononic crystal.

<text>Arkhangelsk (, ) is a city and the administrative center of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia. It lies on both banks of the Northern Dvina near its mouth into the White Sea. The city spreads for over along the banks of the river and numerous islands of its delta. Arkhangelsk was the chief seaport of medieval and early modern Russia until 1703, when it was replaced by the newly founded Saint Petersburg.

A railway runs from Arkhangelsk to Moscow via Vologda and Yaroslavl, and air travel is served by the Talagi Airport and the smaller Vaskovo Airport. As of the 2021 Census, the city&#x27;s population was 301,199.

==Coat of arms==
The arms of the city display the Archangel Michael in the act of defeating the Devil. Legend states that this victory took place near where the city stands, hence its name, and that Michael still stands watch over the city to prevent the Devil&#x27;s return.

==History==
===Early history===
Vikings knew the area around Arkhangelsk as Bjarmaland. Ohthere of Hålogaland told circa 890 of his travels in an area by a river and the White Sea with many buildings. This was probably the place later known as Arkhangelsk. According to Snorri Sturluson, Vikings led by Thorir Hund raided this area in 1027.

In 1989, an unusually impressive silver treasure was found by local farm workers by the mouth of Dvina, right next to present-day Arkhangelsk.

Most of the findings comprised a total of of silver, largely in the form of coins. Jewelry and pieces of jewelry come from Russia or neighboring areas. The majority of the coins were German, but the hoard also included a smaller number of Kufan, English, Bohemian, Hungarian, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian coins. It is hard to place this find historically until further research is completed. There are at least two possible interpretations. It may be a treasure belonging to the society outlined by the Norse source material. Generally such finds, whether from Scandinavia, the Baltic area, or Russia, are closely tied to well-established agricultural societies with considerable trade activity.

Alternatively, like the Russian scientists who published the find in 1992, one may see it as evidence of a stronger case of Russian colonization than previously thought.

===Novgorodian arrival===
In the 12th century, the Novgorodians established a monastery dedicated to Archangel Michael in the estuary of the Northern Dvina. The main trade center of the area at that time was Kholmogory, located southeast of Arkhangelsk, up the Dvina River, about downstream from where the Pinega River flows into the Dvina. Written sources indicate that Kholmogory existed early in the 12th century, but there is no archeological material of this period. It is not known whether the origin of this settlement was Russian, or if it goes back to pre-Russian times. In the center of the small town (or Gorodok) that is there today is a large mound of building remains and river sand, but it has not been archeologically excavated.

===Norwegian–Russian conflict===
The area of Arkhangelsk came to be important in the rivalry between Norwegian and Russian interests in the northern areas. From Novgorod, the spectrum of Russian interest was extended far north to the Kola Peninsula in the 12th century. However, here Norway enforced taxes and rights to the fur trade. A compromise agreement entered in 1251 which was soon broken.

In 1411, Yakov Stepanovich from Novgorod went to attack northern Norway. This was the beginning of a series of clashes. In 1419, Norwegian ships with five hundred soldiers entered the White Sea. The &quot;Murmaners&quot;, as the Norwegians were called (cf. Murmansk), plundered many Russian settlements along the coast, among them the Archangel Michael Monastery.

Novgorod managed to drive the Norwegians back. However, in 1478 the area was taken over by Ivan III and passed to the Grand Duchy of Moscow with the rest of the Novgorod Republic.

===Trade with England, Scotland, and the Netherlands===
Three English ships the &quot;Bona Esperanza&quot;, &quot;Edward Bonaventure&quot;, and &quot;Bona Confidentia&quot; set out to find the Northeast passage to China in 1553; two disappeared, and one, the &quot;Edward Bonaventure&quot; ended up in the White Sea at Nyonoksa, eventually coming across the area of Arkhangelsk at the mouth of the Dvina River where the St. Nicolas Monastery stood. Subsequently, the English gave the name &quot;St. Nicolas Bay&quot; to the sea now known as the White Sea. Ivan the Terrible found out about this, and brokered a trade agreement with the ship&#x27;s captain, Richard Chancellor.

Trade privileges were granted to English merchants in 1555, leading to the founding of the Company of Merchant Adventurers, which began sending ships annually into the estuary of the Northern Dvina. Dutch merchants also started bringing their ships into the White Sea from the 1560s. 
Scottish and English merchants also traded in the 16th century; however, by the 17th century it was mainly the Dutch that sailed to the White Sea area.

===Founding and further development===

In 1584, Ivan ordered the founding of New Kholmogory (which would later be renamed after the nearby Archangel Michael Monastery). At the time access to the Baltic Sea was still mostly controlled by Sweden, so while Arkhangelsk was icebound in winter, it remained Moscow&#x27;s almost sole link to the sea-trade. Local inhabitants, called Pomors, were the first to explore trade routes to Northern Siberia as far as the trans-Urals city of Mangazeya and beyond. In December 1613, during the Time of Troubles, Arkhangelsk was besieged by Polish-Lithuanian marauders commanded by Stanislaw Jasinski (Lisowczyks), who failed to capture the fortified town. In 1619, and again in 1637, fires broke out, and the entire city burned down.

In 1693, Peter the Great ordered the creation of a state shipyard in Arkhangelsk. A year later the ships &quot;Svyatoye Prorochestvo&quot; (Holy Prophecy), &quot;Apostol Pavel&quot; (Apostle Paul), and the yacht &quot;Svyatoy Pyotr&quot; (Saint Peter) were sailing in the White Sea. However, he also realized that Arkhangelsk would always be limited as a port due to the five months of ice cover, and after a successful campaign against Swedish armies in the Baltic area, he founded Saint Petersburg in May 1703. Nonetheless, Arkhangelsk continued to be an important naval base and maritime centre in the Russian north. 
In 1722, Peter the Great decreed that Arkhangelsk should no longer accept goods that amounted to more than was sufficient for the town (for so-called domestic consumption). It was due to the Tsar&#x27;s will to shift all international marine trade to Saint Petersburg. This factor greatly contributed to the deterioration of Arkhangelsk that continued up to 1762 when this decree was cancelled.

Arkhangelsk declined in the 18th century as the Baltic trade became ever more important. Its economy revived at the end of the 19th century when a railway to Moscow was completed and timber became a major export. The city resisted Bolshevik rule from 1918 to 1920 and was a stronghold of the anti-Bolshevik White Army. The White Army was supported by an Allied intervention in which British, French, Italian, and American troops helped to defend against the Bolsheviks. The Allied forces, led by British Lieutenant General Frederick Poole, suffered numerous set-backs and eventually withdrew from Russia. Without Allied support, the poorly disciplined White Army quickly collapsed and the Bolsheviks entered Arkhangelsk on February 21, 1920. Arkhangelsk was also the scene of the Mudyug concentration camp.

During both world wars, Arkhangelsk was a major port of entry for Allied aid. During World War II, the city became known in West Europe as one of the two main destinations (along with Murmansk) of the Arctic convoys bringing supplies in to assist the Soviet Union. During Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Arkhangelsk was one of two cities (the other being Astrakhan) selected to mark the envisioned eastern limit of German control. This military operation was to be halted at this A-A line, but never reached it, as the German armies failed to capture either of these two cities and also failed to capture Moscow.

Arkhangelsk was also the site of Arkhangelsk ITL, or the Arkhangelsk Labour Camp, in the 1930s and 1940s.

Today, Arkhangelsk remains a major seaport, now open year-round due to improvements in icebreakers. The city is primarily a center for the timber and fishing industries.

On March 16, 2004, 58 people were killed in an explosion at an apartment building in the city.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Arkhangelsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Primorsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with five rural localities, incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Arkhangelsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Arkhangelsk is incorporated as Arkhangelsk Urban Okrug.

===City divisions===
For administrative purposes, the city is divided into nine territorial okrugs:
* Isakogorsky
* Lomonosovsky
* Maymaksansky
* Mayskaya Gorka
* Oktyabrsky
* Severny
* Solombalsky
* Tsiglomensky
* Varavino-Faktoriya

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Transportation===
Arkhangelsk is the final destination of Northern Railway. In addition, the city is host to two airports, Vaskovo Airport and Talagi Airport where they host the 2nd Arkhangelsk United Aviation Division and Smartavia Airline, respectively.
M8 highway provides a direct link to Moscow, Yaroslavl and Severodvinsk, the administrative center of the oblast.
Local public transit is provided by buses and minibuses called &quot;marshrutkas&quot;. Until 2004 there were also trams, and until 2008, .

==Education==
Arkhangelsk was home to Pomorsky State University and Arkhangelsk State Technical University which merged with several other institutions of higher learning in 2010 to form the Northern (Arctic) Federal University.

Arkhangelsk is home to the Northern State Medical University, Makarov state Maritime Academy, and a branch of the All-Russian Distance Institute of Finance and Economics.

==Culture==

Mikhail Lomonosov came from a Pomor village near Kholmogory. A monument to him was installed to a design by Ivan Martos in 1829. A monument to Peter the Great was designed by Mark Antokolsky in 1872 and installed in 1914.

After its historic churches were destroyed during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule, the city&#x27;s main extant landmarks are the fort-like Merchant Yards (1668–1684) and the New Dvina Fortress (1701–1705). The Assumption Church on the Dvina embankment (1742–1744) was rebuilt in 2004.

In 2008, it was decided that the city&#x27;s cathedral, dedicated to the Archangel Michael, which had been destroyed under the Soviets, would be rebuilt. The foundation stone was laid in November 2008 by the regional Bishop Tikhon. The cathedral, situated near the city&#x27;s main bus station and river port, is expected to be completed and consecrated in 2019.

Another remarkable structure is the Arkhangelsk TV Mast, a tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting built in 1964. This tubular steel mast has six crossbars equipped with gangways, which run in two levels from the central mast structure out to each of the three guys. On these crossbars there are also several antennas installed.

An unusual example of local &quot;vernacular architecture&quot; was the so-called Sutyagin House. This thirteen-story, tall residence of the local entrepreneur Nikolay Petrovich Sutyagin was reported to be the world&#x27;s, or at least Russia&#x27;s, tallest wooden house. Constructed by Sutyagin and his family over fifteen years (starting in 1992), without plans or a building permit, the structure deteriorated while Sutyagin spent a few years in prison on racketeering charges. In 2008, it was condemned by local authorities as a fire hazard, and the courts ordered it to be demolished by February 1, 2009. On December 26, 2008, the tower was pulled down, and the remainder of the building was dismantled manually by early February 2009.

The cultural life of Arkhangelsk includes:
* The Arkhangelsk Lomonosov Drama Theater
* Arkhangelsk Philarmonia
* Arkhangelsk Youth Theater
* Arkhangelsk Oblast Museum
* Arkhangelsk Art Museum
* Stepan Pisakhov Museum

An airstrip in Arkhangelsk was the fictional setting for a level in the 1997 hit videogame &quot;Goldeneye 007&quot;.

===Literature===
The Russian North, and, in particular, the area of Arkhangelsk, is notable for its folklore. Until the mid-20th century, fairy tales and &quot;bylinas&quot; were still performed on the daily basis by performers who became professionals. Starting from the 1890s, folkloric expeditions have been organized to the White Sea area and later to other areas of the Arkhangelsk Governorate in order to write down the tales and the &quot;bylinas&quot;, especially in Pomor dialects. 

In the 1920s, mostly due to the efforts of Anna Astakhova, these expeditions became systematic. By the 1960s, the performing art was basically extinct. These folkloric motives and fairy tales inspired the literary works of Stepan Pisakhov and Boris Shergin, who were both natives of Arkhangelsk.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Arkhangelsk experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;), with long (November–March), very cold winters and short (June–August), mildly warm summers. More extreme climates at this high latitude - such as Fairbanks, Alaska or Oymyakon, Sakha Republic - have much colder winters than Arkhangelsk, indicating that there is still significant moderation from the Atlantic Ocean.

Snowfall during winter is heavy, while summers are very rainy. Precipitation is very reliable year round.
== Demographics ==

According to the 2021 Census, Arkhangelsk has a population of 301,199 people, which makes it the 68th largest city in Russia.

In the 2010 Census, the following ethnic groups were listed:
==Sports==


Bandy is the biggest sport in the city and is considered a national sport in Russia. Vodnik, the local team, nine times became the Russian champion (1996–2000 and 2002–2005). Their home arena has the capacity of 10000. Arkhangelsk hosted the Bandy World Championship in 1999 and 2003. The 2011–2012 season Russian Bandy League final was played here on March 25, 2012. The 2016 Youth-17 Bandy World Championship was played in Arkhangelsk between January 28 and 31.

<text>Robert Heron Bork (March 1, 1927 – December 19, 2012) was an American legal scholar who served as solicitor general of the United States from 1973 until 1977. A professor by training, he was acting United States Attorney General and a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1982 to 1988. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan nominated Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Senate rejected his nomination after a contentious and highly publicized confirmation hearing.

Bork was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and received both his undergraduate and legal education at the University of Chicago. After working at the law firms of Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher, he served as a professor at Yale Law School. He became a prominent advocate of originalism, calling for judges to adhere to the original understanding of the United States Constitution, and an influential antitrust scholar, arguing that consumers often benefited from corporate mergers and that antitrust law should focus on consumer welfare rather than on ensuring competition. Bork wrote several notable books, including a scholarly work titled &quot;The Antitrust Paradox&quot; and a work of cultural criticism titled &quot;Slouching Towards Gomorrah&quot;.

From 1973 to 1977, he served as Solicitor General under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, successfully arguing several cases before the Supreme Court. During the October 1973 Saturday Night Massacre, Bork became acting U.S. Attorney General after his superiors in the U.S. Justice Department chose to resign rather than fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating the Watergate scandal. Following an order from President Nixon, Bork fired Cox as his first assignment as Acting Attorney General. Bork served as Acting Attorney General until January 4, 1974, and was succeeded by Ohio U.S. Senator William B. Saxbe.

In 1982, President Reagan appointed Bork to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In 1987, Reagan nominated Bork to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell. His nomination attracted unprecedented media attention and efforts by interest groups to mobilize opposition to his confirmation, primarily due to his outspoken criticism of the Warren and Burger Courts and his role in the Saturday Night Massacre. His nomination was ultimately rejected in the Senate, 42–58, and the vacancy was filled by Anthony Kennedy. Bork resigned from his judgeship in 1988, taking up a career as an author. He served as a professor at various institutions, including the George Mason University School of Law. He advised presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and was a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and at the Hudson Institute.

== Early life and education ==
Bork was born on March 1, 1927, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the only child of Harry Philip Bork Jr. (1897–1974), a steel company purchasing agent, and Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Kunkle; 1898–2004), a schoolteacher. His father was of German and Irish ancestry, while his mother was of Pennsylvania German descent.

Bork attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut. He later recalled that he spent his time there &quot;reading books and arguing with people&quot;. He then attended the University of Chicago, where he was a member of the international social fraternity Phi Gamma Delta and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1948. He then attended the University of Chicago Law School, where he was an editor of the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot;. He graduated in 1953 with a Juris Doctor and membership in the Order of the Coif and Phi Beta Kappa. While in law school, Bork took a two-year leave of absence to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean War.

==Career==
===Academia===
After law school, Bork spent another year in military service. From 1954 to 1962, he was in private practice at the law firms Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher. In 1962, Bork left private practice and joined the faculty of Yale Law School as a professor. He taught at Yale from 1962 to 1981, with a four-year break from 1973 to 1977 when he served as U.S. Solicitor General. Among Bork&#x27;s students at Yale Law were Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Anita Hill, Robert Reich, Jerry Brown, Linda Greenhouse, John Bolton, Samuel Issacharoff, and Cynthia Estlund.

As a law professor, Bork was best known for his 1978 book &quot;The Antitrust Paradox&quot;, in which he argued that consumers often benefited from corporate mergers, and that many contemporary readings of the antitrust laws were economically irrational and hurt consumers. He posited that the primary focus of antitrust laws should be on consumer welfare, including producer welfare and consumer welfare, rather than ensuring competition, for fostering competition of companies within an industry has a natural built-in tendency to allow, and even help, many poorly run companies with methodologies and practices that are both inefficient and expensive to continue in business simply for the sake of competition, to the detriment of both consumers and society. Bork&#x27;s writings on antitrust law, with those of Richard Posner and other law and economics and Chicago School thinkers, have been influential in causing a shift in the Supreme Court&#x27;s approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s. Bork also supports using anticompetitive practices within the text as useful business practices. (e.g. exclusive deals, mergers, price fixing, etc.) 

===Solicitor General===
Bork served as Solicitor General in the U.S. Department of Justice from March 1973 until 1977. As Solicitor General, he argued several high-profile cases before the Supreme Court in the 1970s, including 1974&#x27;s &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot;, where his brief in support of the State of Michigan was influential among the justices. Chief Justice Warren Burger called Bork the most effective counsel to appear before the court during his tenure. Bork hired many young attorneys as assistants who went on to have successful careers, including judges Danny Boggs and Frank H. Easterbrook as well as Robert Reich, later Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration.

====Saturday Night Massacre====
On October 20, 1973, Solicitor General Bork was part of the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre&quot; when President Richard Nixon ordered the firing of Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox following Cox&#x27;s request for tapes of his Oval Office conversations. Nixon initially ordered U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Cox. Richardson resigned rather than carry out the order. Richardson&#x27;s top deputy, Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, also considered the order &quot;fundamentally wrong&quot; and resigned, making Bork Acting Attorney General. 

When Nixon reiterated his order, Bork complied and fired Cox. Bork claimed he carried out the order under pressure from Nixon&#x27;s attorneys and intended to resign immediately afterward, but was persuaded by Richardson and Ruckelshaus to stay on for the good of the Justice Department. Bork remained Acting Attorney General until the appointment of William B. Saxbe on January 4, 1974. In his posthumously published memoirs, Bork claimed that after he carried out the order, Nixon promised him the next seat on the Supreme Court, though Bork did not take the offer seriously as he believed Watergate had left Nixon too politically compromised to appoint another justice. Nixon never had the chance to carry out his promise, as the next Supreme Court vacancy came after Nixon resigned and Gerald Ford assumed the presidency, with Ford instead nominating John Paul Stevens following the 1975 retirement of William O. Douglas. Ford planned to nominate Bork to replace William Colby as CIA Director, but his advisors convinced him to turn first to Edward Bennett Williams and then George H. W. Bush instead due to Bork&#x27;s unpopularity and lack of experience in intelligence.

===United States Circuit Judge===
Bork was a circuit judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1982 to 1988. He was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on December 7, 1981, was confirmed via voice vote by the Senate on February 8, 1982, and received his commission on February 9, 1982.

One of Bork&#x27;s opinions while on the D.C. Circuit was &quot;Dronenburg v. Zech&quot;, 741 F.2d 1388, decided in 1984. The case involved James L. Dronenburg, a sailor who had been administratively discharged from the United States Navy for engaging in homosexual conduct. Dronenburg argued that his discharge violated his right to privacy. His argument was rejected in an opinion written by Bork and joined by Antonin Scalia, in which Bork critiqued the line of Supreme Court cases upholding a right to privacy.

In rejecting Dronenburg&#x27;s suggestion for a rehearing &quot;en banc&quot;, the D.C. Circuit issued four separate opinions, including one by Bork (again joined by Scalia), who wrote that &quot;no principle had been articulated [by the Supreme Court] that enabled us to determine whether appellant&#x27;s case fell within or without that principle.&quot;

In 1986, President Reagan considered nominating Bork to the Supreme Court after Chief Justice Warren Burger retired. Reagan ultimately nominated then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist to be the next Chief Justice and Bork&#x27;s D.C. Circuit colleague, Antonin Scalia, for Rehnquist&#x27;s Associate Justice seat. Some journalists and correspondents believed that if Reagan nominated Bork in 1986, Bork would have likely reached the Supreme Court, for the Senate at that time was led by the Republicans. However, the Senate Democrats might still have fought to defeat Bork in 1986, and the Republicans&#x27; Senate majority at the time was narrow (53–47), which implies that maybe Bork still would have been defeated in 1986, especially when the six Republicans who voted against Bork&#x27;s 1987 nomination were not first elected in the November 1986 Senate elections.

===U.S. Supreme Court nomination===


President Reagan nominated Bork for associate justice of the Supreme Court on July 1, 1987, to replace retiring Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. A hotly contested United States Senate debate over Bork&#x27;s nomination ensued. Opposition was partly fueled by civil rights and women&#x27;s rights groups, concerned about Bork&#x27;s opposition to the authority claimed by the federal government to impose standards of voting fairness upon states (at his confirmation hearings for the position of solicitor general, he supported the rights of Southern states to impose a poll tax), and his stated desire to roll back civil rights decisions of the Warren and Burger courts. Bork is one of four Supreme Court nominees (along with William Rehnquist, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh) to have been opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union. Bork was criticized for being an &quot;advocate of disproportionate powers for the executive branch of Government, almost executive supremacy&quot;, most notably, according to critics, for his role in the Saturday Night Massacre.

Before Justice Powell&#x27;s expected retirement on June 27, 1987, some Senate Democrats had asked liberal leaders to &quot;form a &#x27;solid phalanx&#x27; of opposition&quot; if President Reagan nominated an &quot;ideological extremist&quot; to replace him, assuming it would tilt the court rightward. Democrats warned Reagan there would be a fight if Bork were nominated. Nevertheless, Reagan nominated Bork for Powell&#x27;s seat on July 1, 1987.

Following Bork&#x27;s nomination, Senator Ted Kennedy took to the Senate floor with a strong condemnation of him, declaring:

Robert Bork&#x27;s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens&#x27; doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy. ... The damage that President Reagan will do through this nomination, if it is not rejected by the Senate, could live on far beyond the end of his presidential term. President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice.

Bork responded, &quot;There was not a line in that speech that was accurate.&quot; In an obituary of Kennedy, &quot;The Economist&quot; remarked that Bork may well have been correct, &quot;but it worked&quot;. Bork contended in his book, &quot;The Tempting of America&quot;, that the brief prepared for then-Senator Joe Biden, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;so thoroughly misrepresented a plain record that it easily qualifies as world class in the category of scurrility.&quot; Opponents of Bork&#x27;s nomination found the arguments against him justified, claiming that Bork believed the Civil Rights Act was unconstitutional, and he supported poll taxes, literacy tests for voting, mandated school prayer, and sterilization as a requirement for a job, while opposing free speech rights for non-political speech and privacy rights for gay conduct.In 1988, an analysis published in &quot;The Western Political Quarterly&quot; of &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs filed by U.S. Solicitors General during the Warren and Burger courts found that during Bork&#x27;s tenure in the position during the Nixon and Ford Administrations (1973–1977), Bork took liberal positions in the aggregate as often as Thurgood Marshall did during the Johnson Administration (1965–1967) and more often than Wade H. McCree did during the Carter Administration (1977–1981), in part because Bork filed briefs in favor of the litigants in civil rights cases 75 percent of the time.

Television advertisements produced by People For the American Way and narrated by Gregory Peck attacked Bork as an extremist. Kennedy&#x27;s speech successfully fueled widespread public skepticism of Bork&#x27;s nomination. The rapid response to Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Robert Bork&#x27;s America&quot; speech stunned the Reagan White House, and the accusations went unanswered for months.

During debate over his nomination, Bork&#x27;s video rental history was leaked to the press. His video rental history was unremarkable, and included such harmless titles as &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, &quot;Ruthless People&quot;, and &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;. Writer Michael Dolan, who obtained a copy of the hand-written list of rentals wrote about it for the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;. Dolan justified accessing the list on the ground that Bork himself had stated that Americans had only such privacy rights as afforded them by direct legislation. The incident led to the enactment of the 1988 Video Privacy Protection Act.

To pro-choice rights legal groups, Bork&#x27;s originalist views and his belief that the Constitution did not contain a general &quot;right to privacy&quot; were viewed as a clear signal that, should he become a justice of the Supreme Court, he would vote to completely overrule the Court&#x27;s 1973 decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. Accordingly, a large number of groups mobilized to press for Bork&#x27;s rejection, and the 1987 Senate confirmation hearings became an intensely partisan battle.

On October 23, 1987, the Senate denied Bork&#x27;s confirmation, with 42 senators voting in favor and 58 senators voting against. Two Democratic senators (David Boren of Oklahoma, and Fritz Hollings of South Carolina) voted in favor of his nomination, while six Republican senators (John Chafee of Rhode Island, Bob Packwood of Oregon, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Robert Stafford of Vermont, John Warner of Virginia, and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut) voted against it. His defeat in the Senate was the worst of any Supreme Court nominee since George Washington Woodward was defeated 20–29 in 1845, and the third-worst on record.

The seat to which Bork had been nominated went to Judge Anthony Kennedy, who was unanimously approved by the Senate, 97–0. Bork, unhappy with his treatment in the nomination process, resigned his appellate court judgeship in 1988.

=== &quot;Bork&quot; as a verb ===

According to columnist William Safire, the first published use of &quot;bork&quot; as a verb was possibly in &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; of August 20, 1987, two months prior to the final vote: &quot;Let&#x27;s just hope something enduring results for the justice-to-be, like a new verb: Borked.&quot; A well known use of the verb &quot;to bork&quot; occurred in July 1991 at a conference of the National Organization for Women in New York City. Feminist Florynce Kennedy addressed the conference on the importance of defeating the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying: &quot;We&#x27;re going to bork him. We&#x27;re going to kill him politically. This little creep, where did he come from?&quot; Thomas was confirmed after the most divisive confirmation hearing in Supreme Court history to that point.

In March 2002, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; added an entry for the verb &quot;bork&quot; as U.S. political slang, with this definition: &quot;To defame or vilify (a person) systematically, esp. in the mass media, usually to prevent his or her appointment to public office; to obstruct or thwart (a person) in this way.&quot; Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh used the term during his own contentious Senate confirmation hearing testimony, when he stated: &quot;The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment. But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at borking.&quot;

===Later work===
Following his failure to be confirmed, Bork resigned his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and was for several years both a professor at George Mason University School of Law and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. He consulted for Netscape in the Microsoft litigation.

Bork later served as a fellow at the Hudson Institute, a visiting professor at the University of Richmond School of Law and a professor at Ave Maria School of Law in Naples, Florida. In 2011, he worked as a legal adviser for the presidential campaign of Republican Mitt Romney.

===Advocacy of originalism===

Bork is known by American conservatives for his theory that the best way to reconcile the role of the judiciary in the U.S. government against what he terms the &quot;Madisonian&quot; or &quot;counter-majoritarian&quot; dilemma of the judiciary making law without popular approval is for constitutional adjudication to be guided by the framers&#x27; original understanding of the United States Constitution. Reiterating that it is a court&#x27;s task to adjudicate and not to &quot;legislate from the bench,&quot; he advocated that judges exercise restraint in deciding cases, emphasizing that the role of the courts is to frame &quot;neutral principles&quot; (a term borrowed from Herbert Wechsler) and not simply &quot;ad hoc&quot; pronouncements or subjective value judgments. Bork once said, &quot;The truth is that the judge who looks outside the Constitution always looks inside himself and nowhere else.&quot;

Bork built on the influential critiques of the Warren Court authored by Alexander Bickel, who criticized the Supreme Court under Earl Warren, alleging shoddy and inconsistent reasoning, undue activism, and misuse of historical materials. Bork&#x27;s critique was harder-edged than Bickel&#x27;s, writing: &quot;We are increasingly governed not by law or elected representatives but by an unelected, unrepresentative, unaccountable committee of lawyers applying no will but their own.&quot; Bork&#x27;s writings influenced judges such as Associate Justice Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court, and sparked vigorous debate within legal academia about how to interpret the Constitution.

Some conservatives criticized Bork&#x27;s approach. Conservative scholar Harry Jaffa criticized Bork (along with Rehnquist and Scalia) for failing to adhere to natural law principles, and therefore believing that the Constitution says nothing about abortion or gay rights (Jaffa believed that the Constitution &quot;prohibited&quot; these things.) Robert P. George explained Jaffa&#x27;s critique this way: &quot;He attacks Rehnquist and Scalia and Bork for their embrace of legal positivism that is inconsistent with the doctrine of natural rights that is embedded in the Constitution they are supposed to be interpreting.&quot; Jaffa attacked Bork as insufficiently conservative. Bork, in turn, described adherents of natural law constitutionalism as fanatical.

==Works and views==

Bork wrote several books, including the two best-sellers &quot;The Tempting of America&quot;, about his judicial philosophy and his nomination battle, and &quot;Slouching Towards Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline&quot;, in which he argued that the rise of the New Left in the 1960s in the U.S. undermined the moral standards necessary for civil society, and spawned a generation of intellectuals who oppose Western civilization. During the period these books were written, as well as most of his adult life, Bork was an agnostic, a fact used pejoratively behind the scenes by Southern Democrats when speaking to their evangelical constituents during his Supreme Court nomination process. Bork&#x27;s 1971 &quot;Indiana Law Journal&quot; article &quot;Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems&quot; has been identified as one of the most cited legal articles of all time.

In &quot;The Tempting of America&quot;, p. 82, Bork explained his support for the Supreme Court&#x27;s desegregation decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;:
Bork opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, saying that the provisions within the Act which prohibited racial discrimination by public accommodations were based on a principle of &quot;unsurpassed ugliness&quot;. He came to repudiate his earlier views, saying in his 1987 confirmation hearing that the Civil Rights Act and other racial equality legislation of the 1960s &quot;helped bring the nation together in ways which otherwise would not have occurred.&quot; 

Bork opposed the 1965 Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut,&quot; which struck down a Connecticut Comstock Act of 1873 that prohibited the use of contraceptives for married couples. Bork said the decision was &quot;utterly specious&quot;, &quot;unprincipled&quot; and &quot;intellectually empty&quot;. Bork argued that the Constitution only protected speech that was &quot;explicitly political&quot;, and that there were no free speech protections for &quot;scientific, literary or that variety of expression we call obscene or pornographic.&quot;

Bork was known for his disregard for the Ninth Amendment. When asked about his views on unenumerated constitutional rights during his confirmation hearings by Arizona Senator Dennis DeConcini, Bork famously compared the Ninth Amendment to an uninterpretable inkblot, too vague for judges to meaningfully enforce.

In 1998, he reviewed &quot;High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton&quot;, conservative pundit Ann Coulter&#x27;s book on impeaching Clinton, pointing out that &quot;&#x27;High crimes and misdemeanors&#x27; are not limited to actions that are crimes under federal law.&quot;

In 1999, Bork wrote an essay about Thomas More and attacked jury nullification as a &quot;pernicious practice&quot;. Bork once quoted More in summarizing his judicial philosophy. In 2003, he published &quot;Coercing Virtue: The Worldwide Rule of Judges&quot;, an American Enterprise Institute book that includes Bork&#x27;s philosophical objections to the phenomenon of incorporating international ethical and legal guidelines into the fabric of domestic law. In particular, he focused on problems he viewed as inherent in the federal judiciaries of Israel, Canada, and the United States—countries where he believes courts have exceeded their discretionary powers, discarded precedent and common law and instead substituted their own liberal judgment.

Bork advocated modifying the Constitution to allow Congressional supermajorities to override Supreme Court decisions, similar to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&#x27; notwithstanding clause. Though Bork had many liberal critics, some of his arguments have earned criticism from conservatives as well. Although an opponent of gun control, Bork denounced what he called the &quot;NRA view&quot; of the Second Amendment, something he described as the &quot;belief that the constitution guarantees a right to Teflon-coated bullets.&quot; Instead, he argued that the Second Amendment merely guarantees a right to participate in a government militia, that its intent was to guarantee the right of militia membership, not an individual right to bear arms. He is quoted as saying that the gun lobby&#x27;s interpretation of the Second Amendment was intentional deception, not &quot;law as integrity,&quot; and that states could technically pass a ban on assault weapons.

Bork converted to Catholicism from Presbyterianism in 2003.

In October 2005, Bork publicly criticized the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, saying her nomination was &quot;a disaster on every level.&quot;

On June 6, 2007, Bork filed suit in federal court in New York City against the Yale Club over an incident that had occurred a year earlier. Bork alleged that, while trying to reach the dais to speak at an event, he fell, because of the Yale Club&#x27;s failure to provide any steps or handrail between the floor and the dais. (After his fall, he successfully climbed to the dais and delivered his speech.) According to the complaint, Bork&#x27;s injuries required surgery, immobilized him for months, forced him to use a cane, and left him with a limp. In May 2008, Bork and the Yale Club reached a confidential, out-of-court settlement.

On June 7, 2007, Bork with several others authored an &quot;amicus&quot; brief on behalf of Scooter Libby arguing that there was a substantial constitutional question regarding the appointment of the prosecutor in the case, reviving the debate that had previously resulted in the &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot; decision.

On December 15, 2007, Bork endorsed Mitt Romney for president in the 2008 presidential election. He repeated this endorsement on August 2, 2011, during Romney&#x27;s second campaign for the White House.

A 2008 issue of the &quot;Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy&quot; collected essays in tribute to Bork. Authors included Frank H. Easterbrook, George Priest, and Douglas Ginsburg.

==Personal life==
Bork was married to Claire Davidson from 1952 until her death from cancer in 1980. They had a daughter, Ellen, and two sons, Robert Bork Jr. and Charles Bork. In 1982, he married Mary Ellen Pohl, a Catholic religious sister turned activist. Bork Jr. is a prominent conservative activist who is currently president of the Antitrust Education Project.

==Death==
Bork died of complications from heart disease at the Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington County, Virginia, on December 19, 2012, at age 85. Following his death, Scalia referred to Bork as &quot;one of the most influential legal scholars of the past 50 years&quot; and &quot;a good man and a loyal citizen&quot;. He is interred at Fairfax Memorial Park in Fairfax, Virginia.

<text>A parse tree or parsing tree (also known as a derivation tree or concrete syntax tree) is an ordered, rooted tree that represents the syntactic structure of a string according to some context-free grammar. The term &quot;parse tree&quot; itself is used primarily in computational linguistics; in theoretical syntax, the term &quot;syntax tree&quot; is more common.

Concrete syntax trees reflect the syntax of the input language, making them distinct from the abstract syntax trees used in computer programming. Unlike Reed-Kellogg sentence diagrams used for teaching grammar, parse trees do not use distinct symbol shapes for different types of constituents.

Parse trees are usually constructed based on either the constituency relation of constituency grammars (phrase structure grammars) or the dependency relation of dependency grammars. Parse trees may be generated for sentences in natural languages (see natural language processing), as well as during processing of computer languages, such as programming languages.

A related concept is that of phrase marker or P-marker, as used in transformational generative grammar. A phrase marker is a linguistic expression marked as to its phrase structure. This may be presented in the form of a tree, or as a bracketed expression. Phrase markers are generated by applying phrase structure rules, and themselves are subject to further transformational rules. A set of possible parse trees for a syntactically ambiguous sentence is called a &quot;parse forest&quot;.

==Nomenclature==

A parse tree is made up of nodes and branches. In the picture the parse tree is the entire structure, starting from S and ending in each of the leaf nodes (John, ball, the, hit). In a parse tree, each node is either a &quot;root&quot; node, a &quot;branch&quot; node, or a &quot;leaf&quot; node. In the above example, S is a root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, while John, ball, the, and hit are all leaf nodes.

Nodes can also be referred to as parent nodes and child nodes. A &quot;parent&quot; node is one which has at least one other node linked by a branch under it. In the example, S is a parent of both NP and VP. A &quot;child&quot; node is one which has at least one node directly above it to which it is linked by a branch of the tree. Again from our example, hit is a child node of V.

A nonterminal function is a function (node) which is either a root or a branch in that tree whereas a terminal function is a function (node) in a parse tree which is a leaf.

For binary trees (where each parent node has two immediate child nodes), the number of 
possible parse trees for a sentence with &quot;n&quot; words is given by the Catalan number formula_1.

==Constituency-based parse trees==
The constituency-based parse trees of constituency grammars (phrase structure grammars) distinguish between terminal and non-terminal nodes. The interior nodes are labeled by non-terminal categories of the grammar, while the leaf nodes are labeled by terminal categories. The image below represents a constituency-based parse tree; it shows the syntactic structure of the English sentence &quot;John hit the ball&quot;:

The parse tree is the entire structure, starting from S and ending in each of the leaf nodes (&quot;John&quot;, &quot;hit&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;ball&quot;). The following abbreviations are used in the tree:

::* S for sentence, the top-level structure in this example.

::* NP for noun phrase. The first (leftmost) NP, a single noun &quot;John&quot;, serves as the subject of the sentence. The second one is the object of the sentence.

::* VP for verb phrase, which serves as the predicate.

::* V for verb; in this case, it&#x27;s the transitive verb &quot;hit&quot;.

::* D for determiner; in this instance the definite article &quot;the&quot;.

::* N for noun; in this case &quot;ball&quot;.

Each node in the tree is either a root node, a branch node, or a leaf node. A root node is a node that does not have any branches on top of it. Within a sentence, there is only ever one root node. A branch node is a parent node that connects to two or more child nodes. A leaf node, however, is a terminal node that does not dominate other nodes in the tree. S is the root node, NP and VP are branch nodes, and &quot;John&quot; (N), &quot;hit&quot; (V), &quot;the&quot; (D), and &quot;ball&quot; (N) are all leaf nodes. The leaves are the lexical tokens of the sentence. A parent node is one that has at least one other node linked by a branch under it. In the example, S is a parent of both N and VP. A child node is one that has at least one node directly above it to which it is linked by a branch of a tree. From the example, &quot;hit&quot; is a child node of V. The terms &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;daughter&quot; are also sometimes used for this relationship.

==Dependency-based parse trees==
The dependency-based parse trees of dependency grammars see all nodes as terminal, which means they do not acknowledge the distinction between terminal and non-terminal categories. They are simpler on average than constituency-based parse trees because they contain fewer nodes. The dependency-based parse tree for the example sentence above is as follows:

This parse tree lacks the phrasal categories (S, VP, and NP) seen in the constituency-based counterpart above. Like the constituency-based tree, constituent structure is acknowledged. Any complete sub-tree of the tree is a constituent. Thus this dependency-based parse tree acknowledges the subject noun &quot;John&quot; and the object noun phrase &quot;the ball&quot; as constituents just like the constituency-based parse tree does.

The constituency vs. dependency distinction is far-reaching. Whether the additional syntactic structure associated with constituency-based parse trees is necessary or beneficial is a matter of debate.

==Phrase markers==
Phrase markers, or P-markers, were introduced in early transformational generative grammar, as developed by Noam Chomsky and others. A phrase marker representing the deep structure of a sentence is generated by applying phrase structure rules. Then, this application may undergo further transformations.

Phrase markers may be presented in the form of trees (as in the above section on constituency-based parse trees), but are often given instead in the form of &quot;bracketed expressions&quot;, which occupy less space in the memory. For example, a bracketed expression corresponding to the constituency-based tree given above may be something like:

:formula_2

As with trees, the precise construction of such expressions and the amount of detail shown can depend on the theory being applied and on the points that the query author wishes to illustrate.

<doc id="118405" wikidata="Q325427" url="?curid=118405" title="Howard Keel">
<text>Harold Clifford Keel (April 13, 1919November 7, 2004), professionally Howard Keel, was an American actor and singer known for his rich bass-baritone singing voice. He starred in a number of MGM musicals in the 1950s, including &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1951). He played the role of oil baron Clayton Farlow in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; from 1981 to 1991.
==Early life==
Keel was born in Gillespie, Illinois, the younger of two sons born to Navyman-turned-coalminer Homer Keel and his wife, Grace Margaret (née Osterkamp). Howard&#x27;s elder brother was Frederick William Keel. After his father&#x27;s death in 1930, Keel and his mother moved to California, where he graduated from Fallbrook High School at age 17. He worked various odd jobs until settling at Douglas Aircraft Company as a &quot;traveling representative&quot;. He was a long haul truck driver.
In the 1950s, the MGM publicity department stated that Keel&#x27;s birth name was Harold Leek.

==Career==
At age 20, Keel was overheard singing by his landlady Mom Rider and was encouraged to take vocal lessons. One of his music heroes was the great baritone Lawrence Tibbett. Keel later remarked that learning that his own voice was a &quot;basso cantante&quot; was one of the greatest disappointments of his life. Nevertheless, his first public performance took place in the summer of 1941 when he played the role of Samuel the Prophet in Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Saul&quot; (singing a duet with bass-baritone George London).

In 1945, he made his Broadway debut as a vacation replacement for John Raitt in &quot;Carousel,&quot; playing the role of Billy Bigelow from August 20 - September 8, 1945. Two weeks later, on September 24, he took over the lead role of Curly in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, playing across the street at the St. James Theatre. He temporarily left &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; to fill-in once again for John Raitt, this time from June 3 - August 31, 1946, returning to &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; afterwards. In 1947, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; became the first American postwar musical to travel to London, England, and Keel joined the production. On April 30, 1947, at the Drury Lane Theatre, the capacity audience (which included the future Queen Elizabeth II) demanded 14 encores.

Keel made his film debut as Harold Keel at the British Lion studio in Elstree, in &quot;The Small Voice&quot; (1948), released in the United States as &quot;The Hideout.&quot; He played an escaped convict holding a playwright and his wife hostage in their English country cottage. Additional Broadway credits include &quot;Saratoga,&quot; &quot;No Strings,&quot; and &quot;Ambassador.&quot; He appeared at The Muny in St. Louis as Adam in &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954), Emile de Becque in &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1992), and as General Waverly in &quot;White Christmas&quot; (2000).

===MGM===

From London&#x27;s West End, Keel went to Hollywood in 1949 where he was engaged by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio. He made his musical film debut as Frank Butler in the film version of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; (1950), co-starring with Betty Hutton. The film was a big hit and established Keel as a star.

MGM put him with Esther Williams in &quot;Pagan Love Song&quot; (1950), which was successful, but not as profitable as most Esther Williams films because it went over budget. Keel had a third hit in a row with the comedy &quot;Three Guys Named Mike&quot; (1951), supporting Van Johnson and Jane Wyman.

Even more popular was &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1951), where Keel played the male lead with Kathryn Grayson and Ava Gardner. Keel was reunited with Williams in &quot;Texas Carnival&quot; (1952). He had his first flop at MGM with the comedy &quot;Callaway Went Thataway&quot; (1952) co-starring Fred MacMurray and Dorothy McGuire. &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot; (1952), with Grayson and based on the stage musical &quot;Roberta&quot;, was popular but lost money.

MGM tried him in the adventure film &quot;Desperate Search&quot; (1953), which was poorly received. So too was the comedy &quot;Fast Company&quot; (1953). More popular was &quot;Ride, Vaquero!&quot; (1953), with Gardner and Robert Taylor.

 Warner Bros borrowed Keel to play Wild Bill Hickok with Doris Day in &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; (1953), another hit. Back at MGM, he and Grayson made &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; (1953), which again was liked by the public but unprofitable. The same went for &quot;Rose Marie&quot; (1954) which Keel made with Ann Blyth. However &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954) with Jane Powell was a huge success, and it made MGM over $3 million in profit.

Keel was one of many guest stars in &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; (1954). He and Williams made &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Darling&quot; (1955), which lost MGM over $2 million - the first Williams movie to lose money. &quot;Kismet&quot; (1955) with Blyth also lost over $2 million, and Keel was released from his MGM contract.

===Post-MGM===
He returned to his first love, the stage. In 1957, he was in a short-lived revival of &quot;Carousel.&quot; Keel&#x27;s next film was made in Britain, the thriller &quot;Floods of Fear&quot; (1959). He returned to Hollywood to play Simon-Peter in the Biblical epic &quot;The Big Fisherman&quot; (1960). In 1959–1960, he was in the short-lived Broadway musical &quot;Saratoga.&quot; Keel went to Europe to make the low-budget film &quot;Armored Command&quot; (1961). In England, he starred in &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; (1962).

As America&#x27;s taste in entertainment changed, finding jobs became more difficult for Keel. The 1960s held limited prospects for career advancement and consisted primarily of nightclub work, B-Westerns and summer stock. He did &quot;Carousel&quot; in 1962 and 1966. He replaced Richard Kiley on Broadway in &quot;No Strings&quot; (1962). Keel starred in Westerns for A. C. Lyles: &quot;Waco&quot; (1966), &quot;Red Tomahawk&quot; (1966) and &quot;Arizona Bushwhackers&quot; (1968). He had a supporting part in the John Wayne movie &quot;The War Wagon&quot; (1967).

In early 1970, Keel met Judy Magamoll, who was 25 years younger than he and who knew nothing about his stardom. Years later, Keel called the relationship love at first sight, but the age difference bothered him tremendously. For Magamoll, however, it was not a problem, and with the aid of Robert Frost&#x27;s poem &quot;What Fifty Said&quot;, she convinced him to proceed with their relationship. He resumed his routine of nightclub, cabaret and summer stock.

From 1971 to 1972, Keel appeared briefly in the West End and Broadway productions of the musical &quot;Ambassador,&quot; which flopped. In 1974, Keel became a father for the fourth time with the birth of his daughter Leslie Grace. In January 1986, he underwent double heart bypass surgery.

===&quot;Dallas&quot;===
Keel continued to tour with his wife and daughter in tow, but by 1980 had decided to make his life change. He moved his family to Oklahoma with the intention of joining an oil company. The family had barely settled down when Keel was called to California to appear with Jane Powell on an episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. While there, he was told that the producers of the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; wanted to speak with him.

In 1981, after several guest appearances, Keel joined the show permanently as the dignified but hot-tempered oil baron Clayton Farlow. Starting with an appearance on the fourth season, the character had been meant as a semi-replacement patriarch for the series&#x27; Jock Ewing played by Jim Davis, who had died. However, Clayton was such a hit among viewers that he was made a series regular and stayed until its end in 1991. Not only did &quot;Dallas&quot; revive his acting career, it revived his recording endeavors.

===Recording career===
With renewed fame, Keel commenced his first solo recording career, at age 64, as well as a successful concert career in the UK. He released the album &quot;With Love&quot; in 1984, which sold poorly. However, his album &quot;And I Love You So&quot; reached #6 in the UK Albums Chart and #37 in Australia in 1984. The follow-up album, &quot;Reminiscing – The Howard Keel Collection&quot; peaked at #20 in the UK Albums Chart, spending 12 weeks in this listing in 1985 and 1986. The album also peaked at #83 in Australia. In 1988, the album &quot;Just for You&quot; reached #51 in the UK Albums Chart. 

In 1994, Keel and Magamoll moved to Palm Desert, California. The Keels were active in community charity events, and attended the annual Howard Keel Golf Classic at Mere Golf Club in Cheshire, England, which raised money for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). Keel attended the event for many years until 2004.

==Honors==
Keel received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 8 February 1960. It is located at 6253 Hollywood Boulevard.

A Golden Palm Star on the Walk of Stars was dedicated to him in 1996.

Keel was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats.

In 2019, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

==Personal life and death==
In 1943, Keel met and married actress Rosemary Cooper. They divorced in 1948. During the London run of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; Keel met Helen Anderson, a member of the show&#x27;s chorus, and they married in January 1949. Keel and Helen divorced in 1970. Keel married airline flight attendant Judy Magamoll in December 1970.

Keel had four children: three with second wife, Helen Anderson (two daughters, Kaija Liane and Kirstine Elizabeth; and a son, Gunnar Louis; one by his third wife of 34 years, Judy (a daughter, Leslie Grace); and 10 grandchildren.

Keel died at his Palm Desert home on November 7, 2004, six weeks after being diagnosed with colon cancer and a month before his film &quot;Seven Brides For Seven Brothers&quot; was inducted into the National Film Registry.

<text>The London postal district is the area in England of to which mail addressed to the [[London]] [[post town]] is delivered. The General Post Office under the control of the Postmaster General directed Sir Rowland Hill to devise the area in 1856 and throughout its history it has been subject to reorganisation and division into increasingly smaller postal units, with the early loss of two compass points and a minor retraction in 1866. It was integrated by the Post Office into the national postcode system of the United Kingdom during the early 1970s and corresponds to the E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W and WC postcode areas. The postal district has also been known as the London postal area. The County of London was much smaller, at , but Greater London is much larger at .

==History==

===Origins===
By the 1850s, the rapid growth of the metropolitan area meant it became too large to operate efficiently as a single post town. A Post Office inquiry into the problem had been set up in 1837 and a House of Commons committee was initiated in 1843. In 1854 Charles Canning, the Postmaster General, set up a committee at the Post Office in St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand to investigate how London could best be divided for the purposes of directing mail. In 1856, of the 470 million items of mail sent in the United Kingdom during the year, approximately one fifth (100 million) were for delivery in London and half of these (50 million items) also originated there.

The General Post Office under the control of the Postmaster General devised the area in 1856. Sir Rowland Hill produced an almost perfectly circular area of radius from the central post office at St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand in central London. As originally devised, it extended from Waltham Cross in the north to Carshalton in the south and from Romford in the east to Sunbury in the west — six counties at the time if including the City of London. Within the district it was divided into two central areas and eight compass points which operated much like separate post towns. Each was named &quot;London&quot; with a suffix (EC, WC, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW) indicating the area it covered; each had a separate head office. The system was introduced during 1857 and completed on 1 January 1858.

===Abolition of NE and S divisions and retraction of E division===
During the 1860s, following an official report by Anthony Trollope, the E division subsumed the original NE division (which became defunct) and the S division was split between the SE and SW divisions. In 1866, NE was abolished; large districts transferred to E included Walthamstow, Wanstead and Leytonstone. The remaining eight letter prefixes (excluding all numbers) were not changed. In 1868 the S district was abolished and split between SE and SW.

At the same time, the London postal district boundary was retracted in the east, when some Essex areas, including around Ilford, became part of other postal towns.

The NE and S codes have been re-used in the national postcode system and now refer to the NE postcode area around Newcastle upon Tyne and the S postcode area around Sheffield.

===Numbered divisions===

In 1917, as a wartime measure to improve efficiency, the districts were further subdivided with a number applied to each sub-district. This was achieved by designating a sub-area served most conveniently by the head office in each district &quot;1&quot; and then allocating the rest alphabetically by the name of the location of each delivery office. Exceptionally, W2 and SW11 are also &#x27;head districts&#x27;.

The boundaries of each sub-district rarely correspond to any units of civil administration: the parishes and hamlets/chapelries with chapels that traditionally define settlement names everywhere in England and Wales or the generally larger boroughs; despite this, postal sub-districts have developed over time into a primary reference frame. The numbered sub-districts became the &quot;outward code&quot; (first half) of the postcode system as expanded into longer codes during the 1970s.

====Changes====
Ad hoc changes have taken place to the organisation of the districts, such as the creation of SE28 from existing districts because of the construction of the high-density Thamesmead development.

===High-density districts===
;Subdivisions of postcode sub-districts
Owing to heavier demand, seven high-density postcode districts in central London have been subdivided to create new, smaller postcode districts. This is achieved by adding a letter after the original postcode district, for example W1P. Where such sub-districts are used elsewhere such as on street signs and maps, the original unsuffixed catch-all versions often remain in use instead. The districts subdivided are E1, N1, EC (EC1, EC2, EC3, EC4) SW1, W1, WC1 and WC2 (each with several subdivisions). Similarly, there are solely non-geographic suffixed sub-districts for PO boxes in NW1 (e.g. NW1W) and SE1 (e.g. SE1P).

===Relationship to London boundary===

The London postal district has never been aligned with the London boundary. When the initial system was designed, the London boundary was restricted to the square mile of the small, ancient City of London. The wider metropolitan postal area covered parts of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent, Essex and Hertfordshire.

In 1889 a County of London, which was smaller than the postal district, was created from parts of Middlesex, Surrey and Kent. The bulk of 40 fringe sub-districts (having been numbered in 1917) lay outside its boundary including, for example: Leyton, Ealing, Totteridge and Wimbledon

In 1965 the creation of Greater London boundary went beyond these postal districts except for part of the parish of Waltham Holy Cross. The General Post Office was unwilling to follow this change and expand the postal district to match because of the cost. Places in London&#x27;s outer boroughs such as Harrow, Barnet, Wembley, Enfield, Ilford, Romford, Bexleyheath, Bromley, Hounslow, Richmond, Croydon, Sutton, Kingston and Uxbridge are therefore covered by parts of twelve adjoining postcode areas (EN, IG, RM, DA, BR, TN, CR, SM, KT, TW, HA and UB) from postal districts of 5 different counties including Middlesex whose county council was abolished upon the creation of the Greater London Council.

Royal Mail has a seemingly settled policy of changing postcodes only if there is an operational advantage to doing so, unlike the postal services of other countries , and so has no plan to change the postcode system to correlate with the Greater London boundary . In 2003 the then Mayor of London expressed support for revision of postal addresses in Greater London. Similarly, organisations on the fringes of the London postal district have lobbied to be excluded or included in an attempt to decrease their insurance premiums (SE2→DA7) or raise the prestige of their business (IG1-IG6→E19). This is generally futile as Royal Mail changes postcodes only in order to facilitate the delivery of post, and not to illustrate geographical boundaries like the postal services of other countries.

The London postal district includes all of the City of London, Camden, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Wandsworth and Westminster. Almost entirely included are Greenwich, Lambeth, Lewisham, Newham and Waltham Forest, except for a few streets. Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Bexley, Brent, Bromley, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Harrow, Hounslow, Kingston upon Thames, Merton, Redbridge, and Richmond upon Thames are partly in the postal district. Havering, Hillingdon and Sutton are completely outside the postal district. Sewardstone, in postal district E4 and in the Epping Forest District of Essex is anomalously the only place to be outside Greater London but in the London postal area.

Under early abandoned price differentials it formed the inner area of the London postal region, one now obscure definition of Inner London — the term has however lost economic significance from the consumer viewpoint with the standardisation of Royal Mail pricing.

===Significance===
It is common to use postal sub-districts as placenames in London, particularly in the property market: a property may be described as being &quot;in N11&quot;, especially where this can be synonymous with a desirable location but also covers other less prestigious places. Thus sub-districts are a convenient shorthand indicator towards social status, such that a &#x27;desirable&#x27; postcode may add significantly to the value of property, and property developers have tried to no avail to have Royal Mail alter the boundaries of postal districts so that new developments will sound as though they are in a richer area, whether in capital, personal income or both.

Parliament, which first established the London postal district, then created the narrower County of London (1889–1965) and replaced it with the much larger Greater London. However, there has been very little change in London postal district boundaries. Being in a London postcode inaccurately gives a broad definition of Inner London.

===Presentation===
All London postal districts were traditionally prefixed with the post town &#x27;LONDON&#x27; and full stops were commonly placed after each character, e.g. LONDON S.W.1.
Use of the full stops ended with the implementation of the national postcode system . In addition, integration of the London postal districts into postcodes means that as postcodes should be on a separate address line (in line with other postcodes in the national system) the postal district should not now appear after LONDON on the same line but as the first part of the full postcode.

The presentation of the postal districts on street signs in London is commonplace, although not universal as each borough is individually responsible for street signs . Current regulations date from 1952 and were originally for the County of London, but were extended to Greater London in 1965. The section relating to postal districts reads &quot;The appropriate postal district shall be indicated in the nameplate in signal red&quot;.

The area covered is .

==London postal region==

The E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W and WC postcode areas (the eight London postal districts) comprise the &quot;inner area of the London postal region&quot; and correspond to the London post town.

The BR, CM, CR, DA, EN, HA, IG, SL, TN, KT, RM, SM, TW, UB, and WD (the 15 outer London postcode areas) comprise the &quot;outer area of the London postal region&quot;.

The inner and outer areas together comprised the London postal region.

<text>Gijón () or  () is a city and municipality in north-western Spain. It is the largest city and municipality by population in the autonomous community of Asturias. It is located on the coast of the Cantabrian Sea in the Bay of Biscay, in the central-northern part of Asturias; it is approximately north-east of Oviedo, the capital of Asturias, and from Avilés. With a population of 273,744 as of 2023, Gijón is the 15th largest city in Spain.

Gijón forms part of a large metropolitan area that includes twenty councils in the center of the region, structured with a dense network of roads, highways and railways and with a population of 835,053 inhabitants in 2011, making it the seventh largest in Spain.

During the 20th century, Gijón developed as an industrial city in the steel and naval industries. However, due to the decline in manufacturing in these industries, in recent years Gijón is undergoing a transformation into an important tourist, university, commercial and R&amp;D center. Gijón is the location of the Radiotelevisión del Principado de Asturias, the neighbourhood of Cimavilla, the Universidad Laboral de Gijón, the Revillagigedo Palace, and the adjoining Collegiate Church of San Juan Bautista.

Gijón is part of the statistical (not yet developed from an administrative standpoint) &quot;comarca&quot; of Gijón.

==Etymology==

One theory based on some early medieval texts mention it as &quot;Gigia&quot;, derived from the identical Greek and Latin term &quot;gigias&quot;, meaning &quot;giant&quot;, both of which refer to the Greek mythological giant Gigas. The medieval &quot;Gigia&quot; name, in turn, more specifically would refer to the ancient Roman wall built on the peninsula of the Cimavilla neighbourhood of Gijón. This wall was called the &quot;Gegionem&quot; by the Romans, and is itself a compound Latin term being either &quot;geg-ionem&quot;, meaning &quot;giant-ness/gigantic&quot;, &quot;gegi-onem&quot;, meaning &quot;concrete giant&quot;, or &quot;gegio-nem&quot; meaning &quot;giant end&quot;. Presumably the use of the term meaning &quot;giant&quot; referred to either the pre-Germanic Astur peoples who inhabited the area being of large physical stature, or simply the largeness of the wall itself.

The name of the city might also come from the hypothetical Roman actual name of the place &quot;Sessio&quot; which may have turned into the word &quot;Xixón&quot; as the centuries went by. Then the Spanish word &quot;Gijón&quot;, which has been also written during the Middle age as &quot;Jijón&quot; or even &quot;Jixón&quot;, would be a Castilianization of the Asturian name. This theory is nowadays known as the most acceptable.

== History ==
===Prehistory and Romanization===

The first evidence of human presence in what is known nowadays as the municipality of Gijón is located on Monte Deva, where there exists a series of tumuli, and on Monte Areo, where there are some neolithic dolmens. These dolmens were discovered in 1990 and were supposedly built around 5000 BC.

The first noticed settlement (Noega) is located in Campa Torres. It has its origin between the 6th and 5th centuries BC. It was populated by Astures (&quot;Cilúrnigos&quot;) and later Romanized. Noega was progressively abandoned when the Roman wall in the peninsula of Cimavilla, called the &quot;Gegionem&quot;, was built.

===Middle Ages and modern era===
The invasions of barbarian tribes in the 5th and 6th centuries left no traces. The region submitted to the power of the Visigoth king Sisebut in the 7th century. This period marks the beginnings of Christianization, one of the first Christian worshipping places being the Roman villa of Veranes.

Gijón was capital of the Muslim territories on the Cantabric Sea, under the power of Munuza, for a short period between 713 and 718 or 722. In 722 the Asturians won the Battle of Covadonga which is regarded as the beginning of the Reconquista. The Asturian forces were led by Pelagius, who would become the first king of the Kingdom of Asturias.

Until 1270 there were no reliable references to Gijón as a settlement, with only short mentions in some documents. In this year, Alfonso X of Castile gave it the status of &quot;puebla&quot;. This documentation appears in the Monastery of San Vicente de Oviedo.

In the 14th century, the war between Alfonso Enríquez, Count of Gijón and Noreña and Henry III of Castile ended when the village of Gijón was burned and totally destroyed, practically disappearing. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Gijón reemerged. A new dock was built in the port adding fishing and commerce to the area. In the 17th and 18th centuries Gijón began to develop rapidly, growing out of the old city center, supported by the commercial links between the port of Gijón and the American colonies. In the 18th century, due to the French invasions, the wars and the financial trouble in the era, the development stopped until late in the century, when the Oviedo-Gijón road was created and the port was recognized as the best one in Asturias, favoring the start of industrial activities in the town.

===Contemporary history===

The 19th century brought with it great development, with the commerce of coal, the Gijón–León road and later the Langreo–Gijón railway. All this contributed to the quick expansion of the port, since the intensity of the traffic overflowed the port. A new port, El Musel, was built in 1893 and it was the first coal port of the peninsula.

Gijón was going through a conversion to an industrial town with a new bourgeois and an urban development, opening new streets and squares, with new municipal equipments like water, garbage collection, lighting, and so on. All this industrial development brought new manpower to the city and the creation of new neighborhoods like Natahoyo, La Calzada, Tremañes or El Humedal.

In the 20th century, with the Spanish Civil War, the city supported the Republican faction. The army was located in El Coto. The resistance was eliminated in August 1936. Later, the city was the capital of the Sovereign Council of Asturias and León until 20 October 1937, when the troops of General Francisco Franco occupied the city.

Iron manufacture was the main industry of Gijón from the last years of the 19th century until the last decades of the 20th. Uninsa was created in 1971, and it merged with Ensidesa. In the last years of the century was converted in Aceralia, and integrated in Arcelor, along with the Luxembourg-based Arbed and the French company Usinor. The last decades of the century brought an industrial crisis affecting mainly iron manufacture and local shipbuilding. This brought new terrain for the creation of new beaches, parks and neighborhoods. It was also created a campus of the University of Oviedo.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
The city is situated on the coast of central Asturias, from sea level to an altitude of at &quot;Picu Samartín&quot; and at Peña de los Cuatro Jueces, bordered on the West by Carreño, the East by Villaviciosa, and to the South by Siero and Llanera.

The city is situated along the Asturian coast and is distinguished by the peninsula of Cimavilla (the original settlement) which separates the beach of San Lorenzo and adjacent neighborhoods to the east from the beaches of Poniente and Arbeyal, the shipyards, and the recreational port and the Port of El Musel to the west. It is close to the other main Asturian cities, Oviedo and Avilés.

=== Climate ===
Gijón has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) typical of the Atlantic coast of Spain, with cool summers and wet and mostly mild winters. The onshore flow from the Atlantic Ocean creates a cool summer and mild winter climate where severe heat and very cold temperatures are rare. The narrow temperature range is demonstrated by the record August temperature being only 6.4 °C warmer than the all-time record January temperature. The climate is wet and cloudy by Spanish standards, but is indeed drier than other locations on the Atlantic in the country. Humidity is high year-round.

Summer temperatures are very consistent as proven by the fact that the all-time warmest month of August 1997 had an average temperature of and no month has ever been recorded at an average high above in comparison to the August normal high. Another clear underlining of the marine influence is that the coolest ever August has been as near the average as .



== Districts ==
Gijón is divided in six districts: Center, East, South, West, El Llano and Rural. In this last one, all the peri-urban zone and the rural parishes are integrated.

===Neighborhoods and parishes===


== Demography ==

According to the 2021 Municipal Population Register (INE), the council had 268,896 inhabitants, of which 142,411 are women and 126,485 are men.

The municipal population grew remarkably throughout the 20th century, especially between the 1960s and 1980s, a period in which it doubled. Starting in the 1990s, growth stagnated, reflecting the similar slowdown at the national level of Spain. However, due to immigration, both from other Asturias councils and from abroad, the population started to increase again at the turn of the 21st century.

== Culture ==
Cultural activities are carried out throughout the year, which increase considerably in the summer months, especially in August due to the Feast of the Assumption, with parties, music and theater. This complements the continuous programming of the Teatro Municipal Jovellanos (Jovellanos Municipal Theater). The various festivities carried out in Gijón include:

* The Iberoamerican Book Fair, in May
* The Semana Negra in July
* The Feria Internacional de Muestras de Asturias
* The Gijón International Film Festival
* The Semana Mágica Festival, in December.

The Universidad Laboral de Gijón, completed in 1955, contains the LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial (Laboral Center of Art and Industrial Creation). The center was inaugurated on March 30, 2007 as an interdisciplinary space to promote artistic exchange and foster the relationship between society, art, science, technology and the creative industries.

In recent years, Gijón has become a stop city for the Cirque du Soleil. The performances of the Cirque du Soleil have been very successful in the city. In July 2004, Saltimbanco arrived and in the summer of 2007, they presented Alegría in Gijón, the first time that this tour stopped in northern Spain. During the summer of 2009, Cirque du Soleil returned to Gijón with the Varekai show.

Gijón is the birth place of several notable people, like Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, statesman, author, philosopher and a major figure of the Age of Enlightenment.

In the early 1990s there was a boom in indie music bands in the town, which became known as the &quot;Xixón Sound&quot;. The comedy Mortadelo &amp; Filemon: The Big Adventure was also filmed in part in the City of Culture of Gijón. In 2009, the Laboral and its surroundings were converted to the University of Oxford for Fernando González Molina&#x27;s film, Brain Drain.

<doc id="118417" wikidata="Q60453" url="?curid=118417" title="Coevorden">
<text>Coevorden (; ; ) is a city and municipality in the province of Drenthe, in the east of the Netherlands. During the 1998 municipal reorganisation in the province, Coevorden merged with Dalen, Sleen, Oosterhesselen and Zweeloo, retaining its name. In August 2017, it had a population of 35,267.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Coevorden&quot; means &quot;cow ford(s)&quot; or &quot;cow crossing&quot;, similar to &quot;Bosporus&quot; or &quot;Oxford&quot;.

== History ==
Coevorden received city rights in 1408. It is the oldest city in the province of Drenthe.

The city was captured from the Spanish in 1592 by a Dutch and English force under the command of Maurice, Prince of Orange. The following year it was besieged by a Spanish force but the city held out until its relief in May 1594. Coevorden was then rebuilt in the early seventeenth century to an &quot;ideal city&quot; design, similar to Palmanova. The streets were laid out in a radial pattern within polygonal fortifications and extensive outer earthworks.

The city of Coevorden indirectly gave its name to both Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and Vancouver, Washington, named after the 18th-century British explorer George Vancouver. The explorer&#x27;s ancestors (and family name) originally came to England &quot;from Coevorden&quot; (van Coevern in Dutch Low Saxon). There is also a family of nobility with the surname van Coeverden, sometimes spelled with a K (as with Canadian kayaker Adam van Koeverden).

<text>Hoogeveen (; or &quot; &#x27;t Oveine&quot;) is a municipality and a town in the Dutch province of Drenthe. 
== Population centres ==
Elim, Fluitenberg, Hoogeveen and Noordscheschut, which still have the canals which used to be throughout the town. Other villages of the town are Hollandscheveld, Nieuw Moscou, Nieuweroord, Nieuwlande, Pesse, Stuifzand and Tiendeveen.

== History ==
Hoogeveen dates its history to 20 December 1625, when Roelof van Echten bought a large tract of peat land from farmers of the district with the plan to harvest its peat. One old map of the area called it &quot;Locus Deserta Atque ob Multos Paludes Invia&quot;, a deserted and impenetrable place of many swamps. Hoogeveen itself was established in 1636 by Peter Joostens Warmont and Johan van der Meer.

Its coat of arms, granted 10 November 1819, is white, with a pile of peat covered in straw in the center and beehives on each side, representing the town&#x27;s first two major industries.

Vincent van Gogh visited the area in the fall of 1883.

In the second half of the 1960s, Hoogeveen was the fastest growing town in the Netherlands. Until that period, the town contained a number of canals, which had been dug in the area&#x27;s early days when it was a prime source of peat and maritime transportation was a necessity for efficient transportation of cargo. By the 1960s the rise of the automobile and truck-based transportation meant the canals had lost much of their economic function, and the canals were filled in.

The first important transportation connection was provided by the railway line, with Hoogeveen railway station opening in 1870. Since the early 1970s, access to the town has been provided by the A28 (Utrecht - Groningen) highway, and in the early 2000s, the A37 (Hoogeveen - Germany) highway was expanded from a provincial road to improve the region&#x27;s connection to Emmen and further to Germany.

The then recognized oldest person in the world, Hendrikje van Andel-Schipper, lived in Hoogeveen until her death in August 2005, two months after her 115th birthday.

Hoogeveen also has a small airport that attracts some tourism. Since 1997 the Hoogeveen Chess Tournament has been organized here.

<text>Goes () is a city and municipality in the southwestern Netherlands on Zuid-Beveland, in the province of Zeeland. The city of Goes has approximately 29,000 residents.

==History==
Goes was founded in the 10th century on the edge of a creek: (the Short Gos). The village grew fast, and in the early 12th century it had a market square and a church devoted to Mary Magdalene. By 1300, it had a brick castle, now known as Oostende Castle.

In 1405, Goes received city rights from William II, Duke of Bavaria, by his right as count of Holland, and in 1417, it was allowed to build town walls. The prosperity of the city was based upon the cloth industry and the production of salt. In the 16th century, Goes declined. Its connection to the sea silted up and in 1554 a large fire destroyed part of the city.

In the autumn of 1572, during the course of the Eighty Years&#x27; War, Goes, in the Spanish Netherlands, was besieged by Dutch forces with the support of English troops. The siege was relieved in October 1572 by Spanish tercios, who waded across the Scheldt to attack the besieging forces. In 1577, the Spanish soldiers who occupied Goes were driven out by Prince Maurice of Nassau. The prince built a defence wall around Goes, which is still partly standing. From the 17th century, Goes did not play an important role, except as an agricultural centre. In 1868, a railway was constructed through it, but this did not lead to industrialisation. Agriculture remains the most important economic activity.

Although the Netherlands were neutral in the First World War, seven bombs hit Goes and Kloetinge, due to an error by a British airplane. A house in Magdalenastreet in Goes was destroyed and one person killed. Goes did not suffer extensive damage during the Second World War, but was under German occupation until 1944.

Goes did not experience much population growth until the 1970s and 1980s. Then, the city grew fast because of new districts like Goese Meer, Oostmolenpark, Overzuid and Ouverture being constructed. Goes is now the fourth largest economic centre in Zeeland. New districts are in preparation, amongst them Goese Schans, Mannee and Aria, where 3,000 new houses are to be built.

<text>Hulst () is a municipality and city in southwestern Netherlands in the east of Zeelandic Flanders.

== History ==
Hulst received city rights in the 12th century.

Hulst was captured from the Spanish in 1591 by Maurice of Orange but was recaptured by Archduke Albert in 1596. 

In 1640, the Dutch forces tried to conquer the city, but they were defeated in battle by the Spanish Army under Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, and Frederick Henry was forced to retreat.
In 1645, the Siege of Hulst (to control the left bank of the Schelde river) occurred. It was led by Prince of Orange Frederick Henry, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648) with Spain.

In 1702 Vauban attacked the town, but failled to capture it, which makes it the only fortress to successfully resist that great engineer. In 1747 it was taken by the French after incompetent defence by Lt. General Pieter de la Rocque.

In the seventeenth century, a star fort was constructed.
The fortifications, constructed during that time, are historic examples of Dutch fortress architecture.

The name Hulst (Holly in English) would appear to come from the shape of the battlements. Holly is depicted growing around the towns crest.

== Geography ==
Hulst is located at in the south of the province of Zeeland in the southwest of the Netherlands. It is situated in the east of the region Zeelandic Flanders, which is connected by land only to Belgium, on the Dutch-Belgian border.

Hulst is neighbouring the municipalities of Terneuzen in the west, Stekene (Belgium) and Sint-Gillis-Waas (B) in the south, Beveren (B) in the east, and Reimerswaal in the north. The river Western Scheldt separates the land of Reimerswaal and Hulst.

The Drowned Land of Saeftinghe (Verdronken land van Saeftinghe) is a natural reserve in the north of the municipality. Its name refers to the Saeftinghe legend.

The population centers in the municipality are:
== Government ==
The mayor of Hulst is Ilona Jense-van Haarst of the VVD. The former mayor is Jan-Frans Mulder of the Christian Democratic Appeal.

== Culture ==
Since June 2018, the city has its own letter artwork (a local variation on the capital&#x27;s &quot;I Amsterdam&quot;). This work of art can be seen in turns at various locations in the municipality. The underlying idea is that the h at the beginning of a word is not pronounced in the Zeelandic / East Flemish dialect. By combining the letters n and h (in white and green) you can read the text in addition to . Under this concept , a campaign for and branding of the city of Hulst was launched simultaneously.

<text>Oostburg (Zeelandic Flemish: &quot;Wòstburg&quot;) is a city in the south-western Netherlands. It is located in the municipality of Sluis, in the province of Zeeland. As of 1 January 2015, its population is 4731, down from 5008 in January 2005. It received city rights in 1237. Before 1 January 2003, Oostburg was also the name of a municipality. It merged with Sluis-Aardenburg to form the new municipality of Sluis. The municipality covered an area of 224.93 km2, of which 1.05 km2 was water. As well as the town of Oostburg, the former municipality also included the following towns, villages and townships:
*Breskens
*Cadzand
*Groede
*Hoofdplaat
*IJzendijke
*Nieuwvliet
*Schoondijke
*Waterlandkerkje
*Zuidzande

Oostburg is typically a tourist town very close to the beaches at Cadzand. Every Wednesday is market day all year round but in the summer the city is busy and has many events.

==The unicorn==
Oostburg&#x27;s symbol is the unicorn, from which the townsfolk are said to derive strength and courage. In reality, the unicorn&#x27;s presence is represented by a sculpture produced by artist Liesbeth Messer-Heijbroek who for many years, with her husband, lived in the area: she evidently took inspiration from the name of a former inn. The sculpture has been repositioned at least once since it first appeared in 1952 during the postwar reconstruction: at one stage it adorned a small car park. It shares with a modern fountain a spot in &quot;Eenhoornplantsoen&quot; (Unicorn Place) beyond the northern end of the old market square in the town centre.

==World War II Monument==
During the Second World War, approximately 140 Oostburg townsfolk died and most of all the buildings, shops and churches were destroyed. This monument is a tribute to them and the rebuilding of the town. Around the lower part of the monument are the names of those who perished.

<text>Sas van Gent is a town in the Netherlands. It is located in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It is a part of the municipality of Terneuzen and lies about 30 km south of Vlissingen on the border with Belgium.

The Ghent–Terneuzen Canal passes through Sas van Gent, and at that point there was a lock in the canal. The name of the village, &quot;Sas van Gent&quot;, means &quot;sluice of Ghent&quot;, as it sits just north of the Belgian city of Ghent.

==History==
Sas van Gent is a border fortress which was founded in 1547 when the city of Ghent received permission from Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor to dig a canal to the Westerschelde. Between 1551 and 1563, a lock was constructed north of Zelzate which was subsequently fortified. In 1583, it was captured by Spanish troops.

In 1644, it was conquered by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange and became part of the Dutch Republic. The city was attacked by the French in 1672 but could not be taken. The French returned in 1747, and conquered the city. Between 1825 and 1827, the Ghent–Terneuzen Canal was dug, and a side canal was dug to Sas van Gent between 1882 and 1885.

The Catholic Assumption of Mary church is a three-aisled basilica like church built between 1891 and 1892 and designed by Joseph Cuypers. The church is a replacement of its 1739 predecessor.

Sas van Gent was home to 854 people in 1840. In 1869, a railway station opened on the Terneuzen to Ghent railway line. The line was closed in 1939, and the building was demolished in 1967. 

The city started to industrialize in the late 19th century. As the rest of Zeeland did not have enough fresh water for sugar production, Sas van Gent got two beet sugar factories. The first was the NV Zeeuwsche Beetwortelsuikerfabriek founded in 1872. The other was a cooperative; the Eerste Nederlandsche Coöperatieve Beetwortelsuikerfabriek (ENCBS). A museum dedicated to the industrial heritage is located in the warehouses of the former ENCBS, which closed down in 1989. The other sugar factory has been closed in 1986.

Sas van Gent was a separate municipality until 2003, when it was merged with Terneuzen. The former municipality covered an area of 63.65 km² (of which 3.02 km² water).

The former municipality of Sas van Gent also included the following towns, villages and townships: Philippine, Westdorpe, Zandstraat. All are now part of Terneuzen.

<text>Schouwen-Duiveland () is a municipality and an island in the southwestern Netherlands province of Zeeland. The municipality has 33,737 inhabitants (1 January 2016) and covers an area of (of which is water).

The northside of the island has two fixed connections to Goeree-Overflakkee, the Brouwersdam and the Grevelingen. The southside has two fixed connections to cross the Oosterschelde to North Beveland, the Stormvloed Kering or Oosterscheldedam, part of the Delta Works and the Zeeland Bridge. 
The island is mostly flat and is, besides a small area, below the sea level. On the western tip is a dune whose highest point is about 42 meters above sea level. The island is, in the summer, very popular with (German) tourists. The Renesse area is a popular holiday destination for young people.

The Brouwersdam is a dam, part of the Delta Works, from Schouwen-Duiveland to Goedereede, the west part of the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in South Holland.

==History==

The island of Schouwen-Duiveland originally consisted of four islands: Schouwen, Duiveland, Dreischor, and Bommenede. Over the centuries it has grown by nature and man together. The dam between Schouwen and Duiveland dates from 1610.

On 30 April 1900 the Rotterdam Tramway Company opened a steam tram line on the island running as public transport until 1 February 1953. After the floods of 1953, the service has not been restored and has been replaced by a bus line.

During the Second World War, Schouwen-Duiveland was the only Zeelandic island that remained under German occupation until May 1945. In December 1944, the Germans had declared their intent to deport all local men aged between 17 and 40. The local resistance fighters made plans to sabotage this by stealing all the registers on the island with the help of nearby Allies, who were preparing to liberate the island. Events unfolded that led to the capture of ten local men who were subsequently executed.

After the completion of the Brouwersdam in 1972 the island became a center of water sports. Surfing, sailing and diving are common activities on the North Sea beaches and the Grevelingenmeer.

== Geography ==

===Topography===
&quot;Dutch Topographic map of the island of Schouwen-Duiveland, as per Sept. 2014.&quot;

===Demography===

The main population centres are listed in the tables below (as of 2021).



There are two places in Schouwen-Duiveland, Zierikzee and Brouwershaven, which in the past had gained city rights. Then there are the hamlets Looperskapelle, Moriaanshoofd, Nieuwerkerk, Nieuwerkerke, Schuddebeurs, Westenschouwen, Zierikzee, Beldert, Brijdorpe, Burghsluis, Capelle, Elkerzee and New Haamstede. The town hall is in Zierikzee.
There is no village called Schouwen-Duiveland; the municipality takes its name from the island, which received its name when the former islands Schouwen and Duiveland (and Dreischor) were poldered together.

==Nature in Schouwen-Duiveland==
A large number of nature reserves can be found on Schouwen-Duiveland. They are usually managed by Staatsbosbeheer. Most nature reserves are accessible to visitors. The areas are particularly suitable for bird watchers and cyclists. In the nature of Schouwen Duiveland, European special species such as avocet, curlew and plover can be found. Boswachterij Westerschouwen is the largest forest in the province of Zeeland.

==Culture==

There are a number of national monuments in the municipality, including the war memorial at Oude Moolweg in Renesse and the Jewish Memorial on Caustraat in Zierikzee. The war memorial commemorates in particular the ten local resistance fighters executed by the Germans on 10 December 1944. It also commemorates all local citizens who died during the Second World War and the &#x27;police actions&#x27; in the Dutch East Indies.

The Westenschouwen mermaid was the main character in a saga that is localized in Zeeland relating to the destruction of the village Westenschouwen on the island of Schouwen-Duiveland. The mermaid saga explains the decline of this once prosperous village. The saga predicts the demise of the village, with only the tower remaining. After the tower was demolished in 1845, the Plompe Tower was seen as the remaining tower of Westenschouwen. Plompe Tower is open to tourists and when you open the door of the tower the story of the mermaid will be played automatically and displayed via a carousel stories. The mermaid is celebrated in the local coat of arms.

<doc id="118438" wikidata="Q10083" url="?curid=118438" title="Veere">
<text>Veere (; ) is a municipality with a population of 22,000 and a town with a population of 1,500 in the southwestern Netherlands, in the region of Walcheren in the province of Zeeland.

== History ==
The name &quot;Veere&quot; means &quot;ferry&quot;: Wolfert Van Borssele established a ferry and ferry house there in 1281. This ferry he called the &quot;camper-veer&quot; or &quot;Ferry of Campu&quot; by which name Camphire it was known, at least in England, until the seventeenth century. It eventually became known as &quot;de Veer&quot;. In the same year 1281 Wolfert also built the castle Sandenburg on one of the dikes he had built. On 12 November 1282, Count Floris V. thereupon issued a charter by which Wolfert received the sovereignty to the land and castle with the ferry and ferry house. From that time on Wolfert was given the title of Lord Van der Veer. Veere received city rights in 1355. 

The &quot;Admiraliteit van Veere&quot; (Admiralty of Veere) was set up as a result of the Ordinance on the Admiralty of 8 January 1488 in an attempt to create a central naval administration in the Burgundian Netherlands. To this was subordinated the Vice-Admiralty of Flanders in Dunkirk. In 1560 under admiral Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn, this admiralty relocated near Ghent and in 1561 the Habsburg naval forces were also moved to Veere.

Veere functioned as the staple port for Scotland between 1541 and 1799. In Scotland it was known as Campvere. Until the Anglo-Dutch wars it was an important trading port for the import among other things, of saffron from East Anglian ports such as Wells.

Flemish architects Antonis Keldermans and Evert Spoorwater designed the &quot;Grote Kerk&quot;, the fortifications, the Cisterne and the town hall. During this period of prosperity, the cultural centre was located at Sandenburgh castle, the residence of the noble Van Borsele and Van Bourgondië families. Court painter Jan Gossaert van Mabuse worked here. The poet Adrianus Valerius lived and worked in the city from 1591. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Veere was a prosperous trading city, with about 750 houses inside the city walls then, compared to about 300 .

At the start of the Second World War, there was a Royal Netherlands Navy seaplane base at Veere, with six Fokker C XIV-W aircraft. On 12 May 1940 the base was bombed by He 111 bombers causing some casualties. On 14 May, the seaplanes were ordered to evacuate to France and then England, eventually arriving in the Dutch East Indies where they would be destroyed in action with the Japanese in 1941 and 1942. On 17 May, German infantry of &quot;SS Regiment Deutschland&quot; of the 2nd SS Panzer Division crossed onto Walcheren via the Sloedam and by 18:00 that evening, the Dutch forces on the island, including the garrison at Veere, were ordered to surrender. Veere was finally liberated on 7 November 1944 by Scottish troops of the British 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division during Operation Infatuate, the Allied assault on Walcheren. As part of the preparations for the operation, the island&#x27;s sea dykes were bombed resulting in the inundation of much of the area. Unlike many other towns on the island, Veere was virtually undamaged in the fighting.

As a result of the damming of the Veerse Gat inlet in 1961, the fishing fleet of Veere moved to a new home port at Colijnsplaat on Noord-Beveland. the main business of the town is tourism.

Veere municipality reached its current expanded shape in 1997, after the addition of several neighboring towns. During the course of nearly two centuries seventeen historical municipalities have merged to become present-day Veere. Its original full name was &quot;Veere-de-Stad en Zanddijk-Binnen&quot;.

== Geography ==

The city of Veere stands on the Veerse Meer lagoon on the island of Walcheren in the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands.

The area of the municipality of Veere is 13,496 hectares, with a coastline of 34 kilometres and a population of about 22,000.

=== Population centres ===
The population centres in the municipality are:
== Tourism ==
The area is visited by 4 million tourists annually. The main attractions are the beaches and marinas. The Storm Surge Barrier on the Oosterschelde is the most popular visitor attraction in Zeeland. The Scoutcentrum Zeeland on the coast of the Veerse Meer attracts Scout visitors from around the world

The town of Veere forms the setting for &quot;Van Loon&#x27;s Lives&quot;, a book of contemporary fantasy written by Hendrik Willem Van Loon in 1942, in which the protagonists are able to magically summon the great men and women of history for weekend dinner parties, leading to often humorous incidents. The book was written at the time when Veere, like the rest of the Netherlands, lay under Nazi occupation, and despite its light-hearted tone clearly indicates the longing of the writer – living in the US – for his homeland whose liberation he was doomed never to see.

Scottish singer-songwriter Brian McNeill based the song &quot;The Holland Trade&quot; from his tenth studio album &quot;The Baltic tae Byzantium&quot; on the trade and cultural ties between Veere and Scotland from 1541 on.

<text>Dronten () is a municipality and a town in the central Netherlands, in the province of Flevoland. It had a population of in .

== History ==
Plans for the municipality of Dronten were made in the early half of the 1950s; real plans for the town of Dronten (the municipality&#x27;s center) were revealed in 1958.

The foundations for the town were laid in 1960. Right from the start there was a discussion whether Dronten was to become a town or a city. The first plans assumed 15,000 inhabitants, while later plans foresaw a growth to 30,000 inhabitants. The first plans for the municipality assumed ten smaller villages situated around the central town (in this case, Dronten). The number of villages was reduced because of increased motorized traffic and experiences gained in developing the Noordoostpolder, where a similar municipality had already been built. Eventually, it was decided that there were to be two smaller villages (Biddinghuizen and Swifterbant) and one larger town (Dronten).

On 1 January 1972, Dronten was given its official name.

In 1995, Dronten hosted in Biddinghuizen the 18th World Scout Jamboree. 28,960 Scouts and staff members from 166 countries and territories participated this event.

<text>Orlyval is a light metro shuttle service at Paris&#x27;s Orly Airport using the Véhicule Automatique Léger (VAL, English: &quot;automatic light vehicle)&quot; driverless, rubber-tyred people mover technology. The line, which opened on 2 October 1991, offers free service between the two airport terminal stations, and premium fare service to Antony station, where passengers can connect to the city&#x27;s RER B trains. Orlyval is the second line to use the VAL technology after the Lille Metro and the first airport people mover system to use VAL.

The line was financed and initially operated by private companies including Matra, the company that developed the VAL technology, along with several international developers. The line was a commercial failure and the operators went bankrupt. RATP Group, the transportation operator for the Paris region, took over the line in 1992.

Following the extension of Paris Metro line 14 to Orly Airport in June 2024, the future of the line is currently being considered by Île-de-France Mobilités.

==History==

Orly Airport is the primary airport for domestic flights between Paris and other cities in France. During the 1980s, the only transportation options to the airport were by road. Bus routes to the airport were often crowded and traffic jams were frequent.

Several projects were suggested: an extension of Paris Métro Line 7, an additional branch of the RER B, and an extension of the RER C. Ultimately, in December 1987, authorities opted for the construction of a shuttle line from the airport to Antony station on the RER B line using the Véhicule Automatique Léger (VAL) technology developed by Matra for the Lille Metro which opened in 1983. The project was seen (and criticized) as a showcase project for Matra who was hoping to sell VAL systems to cities across the world.

The government of Jacques Chirac was skeptical about financing the shuttle line and instead offered up a concession: the right for a private company to operate the shuttle line on the airport grounds. A consortium was formed to build the line, consisting of the domestic airline Air Inter (26.7% share), builder Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez (18% share), VAL manufacturer Matra (17.3% share), and public transport operator RATP (3.3% share). The other 34.7% of the consortium was owned by several banks including Caisse des Dépôts, Crédit Lyonnais, and Indosuez. With daily ridership forecasted at over 14,000 passengers, the banks helped the group secure loans worth 1.55 billion french francs (about €21.65 million).

The Orlyval opened on 2 October 1991, about three months ahead of schedule. Almost immediately, ridership was lower than expected. Blame was placed on the premium fare, 55 francs (about €8), and the transfer between VAL and RER trains at Antony station. Daily ridership was around 4,500, only a third of the predicted traffic. After a few months of operation, fares were reduced, but ridership remained low. In the first full year of operation, the line only served 1.2 million travelers, instead of the 4.3 million initially forecasted. In December 1992, the line was put into compulsory liquidation.

Operation of the line was taken over by RATP, who would receive an operating subsidy of ten million francs per year until the end of 2021, paid by the Île-de-France region. The settlement also included the requirement that until the end of 2021, a portion of each fare should go to repaying creditors, expected to return about 67% of their original investment. Because of this agreement, fares on the line remained higher than other forms of transportation in the region. As of the end of 2016, the line generated about 10.5 million euros in fares per year.

Ridership increased after the RATP took over operation of the line. The RATP carried out a study of riders in early 1994 and learned the clientele mostly consisted of businessmen traveling between the city and the airport for professional reasons. As a result of the study, in June 1994, RATP increased operating hours of the Orlyval to enable connections to the first and last domestic flights. Since the 2000s, traffic has experienced an annual increase of 8 to 10%. Ridership for the year 2013 amounted to 3.1 million trips.

In June 2024, Paris Metro line 14 was extended to Orly Airport with the opening of Aéroport d&#x27;Orly station, shortly before the start of the 2024 Summer Olympics and 2024 Summer Paralympics. This offered a faster and cheaper route to central Paris without needing to change trains. By October 2024, ridership on Orlyval and Orlybus had fallen by around 70%. 

=== Future ===
Following the extension of line 14 to Orly Airport, Orlyval faces an uncertain future. By 2028, Paris Metro Line 18 is scheduled to link the airport with the RER B and C lines at .

, Île-de-France Mobilités is considering options on the future of the line. The first option would be the modernisation of the line with three additional stations built to serve the local community (around €290 million) – this is being lobbied for by the towns of Antony and Wissous as well as the Paris-Saclay community. The second option would be the dismantling of the line (around €150 million), with possible reuse of the right of way as a cycle path or bus lane.

Groupe ADP – the operator of Orly Airport – desires that the line be converted to a &quot;internal shuttle&quot; to transfer people between Orly 1, 2, 3 and Orly 4.

== Fares and ticketing ==
Travel between the airport&#x27;s terminals is free of charge. Passengers travelling to or from Antony station must pay, and exit fare gates are in place at Antony for passengers coming from the airport.

The one-way fare for the six-minute ride from Orly to Antony or vice-versa is €11 as of March 2023; this is not affected by the fare cap of €5 on RER tickets announced in March 2022. Children aged 4 to 10 pay half fare and babies aged 3 and under are free. Combined tickets valid onwards to a RER station are available with fares depending on the distance travelled. The only other ticket valid for the route is the Paris Visite 1 to 5 day pass; Mobilis day tickets and Navigo season tickets are not valid.

<text>Almere () is a planned city and municipality in the province of Flevoland, Netherlands across the IJmeer from Amsterdam. 

Bordering Lelystad and Zeewolde, the municipality of Almere comprises six official areas that are the districts of Almere Stad (which is further split up into Almere Stad Oost, Almere Stad West and Almere Centrum), Almere Buiten and Almere Pampus (which is currently being designed), and the boroughs of Almere Haven, Almere Hout and Almere Poort. Four of them feature official district or borough offices. Furthermore, it also comprises the unofficial historic district and neighborhood Oostvaardersdiep. Almere is part of the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (MRA).

Almere is the newest city in the Netherlands: the land on which the city sits, the Southern Flevoland polder, was reclaimed from the IJsselmeer from 1959 to 1968. The first house was finished in 1976, and Almere became a municipality in 1984. It has the largest population of the municipalities in Flevoland with
 citizens in and the 8th largest in the Netherlands. In October 2007, the city council of Almere made agreements with the government to expand the city to 350,000 inhabitants by 2030.

==History==

The original plans for the IJsselmeerpolders saw the land being used for agriculture. However, after World War II housing was needed for the rapidly growing population of Amsterdam and two towns were planned in the polders Oostelijk Flevoland and Zuidelijk Flevoland. The town in Oostelijk Flevoland became Lelystad. The town in Zuidelijk Flevoland was still called Zuidweststad (English: South West City) on the first sketches, but in the 1970s it became called &quot;Almere&quot;, named after the lake Almere, the early medieval name of the Zuiderzee. The first house in Almere was finished in 1976. At that time the town was still controlled by the &quot;Openbaar Lichaam Zuidelijke IJsselmeerpolders&quot; (Z.IJ.P.), with a Landdrost. In 1984 Almere became an official municipality. Originally, Almere was envisioned as a town with multiple centres. This idea was later abandoned in favor of allowing neighbourhoods like Tussen de Vaarten to be built. There is also a difference between the way houses are built in the oldest and the newest parts of the city. The housing plan in Almere in the 1970s was basic functionality and a levelling of social status. However, starting in the 1990s more exclusive homes with striking designs were built (notably in the Regenboogbuurt).

==Governance==

===Local executive===
Hein van der Loo (independent) has been mayor of Almere since March 2023, with the municipal council consisting of a coalition of several parties.

===Municipal council===
The first municipal council was installed on 2 January 1984 in the presence of the then-Minister of the Interior Koos Rietkerk. The council elections took place on 21 September 1983. Prior to 1984 Almere had an &quot;Adviesraad&quot;, which was chosen every 2 years (1978–1980, 1980–1982, 1982–1984). This &quot;Adviesraad&quot; was made up of different political parties similar to a local council. On 11 March 1977 the first &quot;adviescommissie&quot; was elected. It consisted of 5 people that were chosen on personal title.
Since 2018, the council of Almere has comprised a total of 45 members.
==International relations==
===Twin cities===
Almere maintains international relations with the following twin cities:
==Geography==

Almere is located in the polder of Southern Flevoland (Dutch: &quot;Zuidelijk Flevoland&quot;). It is the most western municipality of the province Flevoland. It borders with Markermeer in the west and north, Lelystad in the northeast, Zeewolde in the east, and Gooimeer in the south.

Almere consists of three boroughs and three districts (Dutch: &quot;stadsdelen&quot;), three of which are under construction.
===Climate===

Almere has an oceanic climate characterized by mild to cool winters, and warm summers with fair precipitation year-round.

==Demography==

===Inhabitants by origin===

===Total population===

==Culture==

On 19 May 2004, at the instigation of Kees Kousemaker, owner of the Amsterdam comics store Lambiek, the first buildings of the &quot;Stripheldenbuurt&quot; were inaugurated in Almere. This is a district where all street names are named after famous comics characters and cartoonists.

==Sport==

Almere is the home of football team Almere City FC, American football team FlevoPhantoms and the home of professional basketball team the Almere Sailors.

==Transport==

The traffic infrastructure in Almere is recognisable because of its
separate infrastructure for cycles (which, in most cases, have separate cycle paths), cars
and buses (the buses drive on a separate bus lane in most parts of the city).
Almere is connected to the motorways A6 and A27.

===Railway===
In 1987 Almere was connected to the national railway system (see
NS) with the fully completed
Flevolijn which connected Weesp to Lelystad Centrum.

Almere currently has six railway stations:
*Almere Poort (opened December 9, 2012)
*Almere Muziekwijk (opened May 30, 1987)
*Almere Centrum (opened May 30, 1987)
*Almere Parkwijk (opened on February 1, 1996)
*Almere Buiten (opened May 30, 1987)
*Almere Oostvaarders (opened December 12, 2004)

A seasonal-use station, Almere Strand, was set up for certain events, such as Libelle Zomerweek. The station was made up of iron platforms. It was opened in May 1996 under the name &quot;Muiderzand&quot;. The station was closed after June 1996 but re-opened in June 1999 under the name &quot;Muiderstrand&quot; and closed again in July 1999. It re-opened again in 2001 under the name &quot;Almere Strand&quot; as an official seasonal-use station, meaning it was now open certain seasons every year. Because of the rapid development of the adjacent borough Almere Poort, it was decided to open an official station there (see Almere Poort), thus making the station of Almere Strand obsolete. Almere Poort station opened on December 9, 2012. Therefore, Almere Strand station was officially closed just after the summer of 2012 and its iron platforms were torn down in the weekend of October 6–7, 2012. There are no remains of the station, although passengers can still see where the platforms once stood from the windows of Flevolijn trains.

===Public buses===

====Local bus lines====
In Almere there are 11 bus lines which service the urban area.

Monday to Friday, most city buses run about every 5 minutes (10 times every hour) during daytime hours. Saturdays, only a few city bus lines run every 7.5 minutes during daytime hours; most of them run every 12–15 minutes. Sunday, most of the city buses run every 15 minutes (with some buses running extra runs during certain hours) and M6 which only runs every 30 minutes.

There are a few overnight bus lines (Mon-Sat nights only): N21, N22 and N23. They run under the Keolis internal name nightGo (but are operated by R-net branded regional buses).

The bus company running almost all buses is Keolis Netherlands. Local buses (city buses) run under the name allGo. In the buses one can use the national transportation chipcard (smart card), subscriptions or one can buy bus tickets of allGo in the bus or at TVM&#x27;s (the latter only Downtown).

====Regional bus lines====
Besides the local bus lines, there are regional and rush hour bus lines to towns and cities in the area.
&quot;Line 159 is operated by the bus company Connexxion.&quot;

Since April 2012, there was a rush hour route, 150, to Utrecht which connected Almere directly with the University Area of Utrecht called De Uithof. (This was previously done by former bus line 295). Due to budget cuts, line 150 was scrapped on July 9, 2016.

<doc id="118446" wikidata="Q5407300" url="?curid=118446" title="Axel (name)">
<text>Axel (also &quot;Aksel&quot;) is a Scandinavian, German, French, and Dutch masculine given name. In Estonia, Denmark, and Norway the spelling Aksel is more common. The Finnish form of the name is Akseli. A French feminine form is Axelle.

Because the Danish archbishop Absalon (1128–1201) was also known as &quot;Axel of Lund&quot;, the name has been interpreted as a corruption of the Hebrew name Absalom. &quot;Axel&quot; arose via &quot;Axelen&quot; from &quot;Absalon&quot;, possibly by conflation with the existing name &quot;Askel&quot;, &quot;Askil&quot;, medieval forms of the Old Norse name &quot;Ásketill&quot;, from &quot;ans&quot; &quot;god&quot; and &quot;ketill&quot; &quot;cauldron/helmet&quot;.

<text>Urk (; ; ) is a municipality and a town in the Flevoland province in the central Netherlands.

Urk is first mentioned in historical records dating to the 10th century, when it was still an island in the Almere, an inland sea that would become part of the Zuiderzee in the 13th century after a series of incursions by the North Sea. In 1939, a dike from the mainland to Urk ended the town&#x27;s island status, just as the Afsluitdijk project was changing the salt water Zuiderzee surrounding Urk to the less saline IJsselmeer. Later in the 20th century, seabed areas surrounding Urk were reclaimed from the sea to become the Noordoostpolder.

The mainstay of the town&#x27;s formal economy has always been fishing, and the products of the sea coming in through Urk harbor continue to be exported widely, although today Urk&#x27;s fishing boats must travel greater distances to gather them than was required in most historical periods.
Religious life has traditionally been very important to Urk&#x27;s inhabitants, with active, conservative congregations of the Dutch Reformed denominations playing key roles in the life of the community.

== Geography ==

Towards the north, the IJsselmeer is enclosed by an arc of boulder clay high areas of land which formed during an ice age glaciations of the Pleistocene epoch: Texel, Wieringen, Urk, de Voorst, and Gaasterland. To the south of that arc a lake formed as a result of meltwater, which became known as Almere. North of the boulder clay highland of Urk, the Vecht river flowed into the Almere, while the river IJssel with tributaries flowed into the south of Urk. As the climate became warmer during the Middle Ages, the sea level rose whilst the surrounding areas have been slowly steadily sinking because of forebulge effect since the end of the Ice Age. During the 13th century (and especially after a large storm in 1287) the Zuiderzee formed, and the water round Urk suddenly became a tidal sea. Because there was no sea defense, over time large pieces of the island eroded. The southwest side of Urk, which rose perpendicularly out of the sea, was called &quot;het Hoge Klif&quot; (&quot;the High Cliff&quot;). Around 1700 the municipality of Amsterdam donated sea defenses to Urk. The town contains the highest point in the province of Flevoland.

== History ==

The oldest instance of the name &quot;Urk&quot; is a donation certificate of 966 from Holy Roman Emperor Otto I to the Sint Pantaleonsklooster monastery in Cologne. The text reads: &quot;cuiisdam insulae medietatem in Almere, que Urch vocatur&quot; (Latin: &quot;of a certain island in the middle of Almere, which is called Urch&quot;). Until 1475 the High and Low Lordship of Urk and Emmeloord (the most northern village of Schokland) was in the hands of the Van Kuinre family. From 1475 to 1614, the Zoudenbalch family of Utrecht were Lords of Urk and Emmeloord. From 1614 to 1660, Urk and Emmeloord were ruled by the van der Werve from Antwerp. From 1660 to 1792 Urk and Emmeloord belonged to the municipality of Amsterdam, and ruled from 1660 to 1672 by Andries de Graeff. From 1792 to 1950 Urk belonged to the province of North Holland.

After World War II, Urk ceased to be an island, and Urk&#x27;s town expanded into the reclaimed land of the polder. Many Urkers who previously left the town because of overcrowding before the polder reclamation was completed were able to return to Urk. From 1950 to 1986 Urk belonged to the province of Overijssel. Since 1986, Urk has belonged to the province of Flevoland.

The Noordoostpolder in its early years had an alternative name &quot;Urker Land,&quot; from which Urk&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Het Urkerland&quot;, gets its name.

== Economy ==

The important economic pillar of the village remains fishery. After the IJsselmeer was formed, the Urkers moved their fishing operations to the North Sea. Additionally, Urk is focused on making a connection between the existing economy and new activities such as tourism, social care, maritime industry and services. The local council is keen to particularly promote tourism, retail and fisheries. In the past, many lives were lost in storms on the Zuiderzee and North Sea. There is a memorial to lost fishermen on Urk, popularly known as the &quot;Urker vrouw&quot;: a statue of a woman looking out to sea, vainly awaiting the return of her husband and sons.

== Politics ==

===Local===

The municipal council currently (2022) contains five political parties:
*SGP: 6 seats
*Christian Union: 3 seats
*CDA: 3 seats
*Hart voor Urk: 3 seats
*Gemeentebelangen: 2 seats 
*PVV: 1 seat
*Krachtig Urk: 1 seat
&quot;Gemeentebelangen&quot;, &quot;Hart voor Urk&quot; and &quot;Krachtig Urk&quot; are local parties. Hart voor Urk was founded by former SGP councillor Jan Koffeman with largely identical party policies to SGP&#x27;s.

A majority coalition of ChristenUnie, SGP and Hart voor Urk are currently in power. The town council is led by (non-elected) mayor Cees van den Bos.

None of these parties can be described as either left-wing (socialist) or liberal. National parties, such as the VVD (conservative/liberal), D66 (liberal), GroenLinks (green party) and PvdA (labour), are not represented in Urk&#x27;s town council and support for these parties in national and regional elections remains minimal. However, due to slowly growing support for the VVD, an Urk affiliate of the conservative/liberal party was founded in early 2011 and entered the 2014 local elections. However, the VVD only drew 2.7% of the vote, insufficient for a seat.

===National===
Urk is one of the most politically conservative areas in the Netherlands. As part of the so-called Dutch &quot;Bible belt&quot;, a vast majority of election votes go to the three Christian parties in the Netherlands, SGP, ChristenUnie and CDA. Urk is also known for its high turnout at each election, which is usually considerably higher than the national average (although general turnout percentages have dropped approx. 10% since 2002).

Voting patterns used to be relatively stable, with approximately 85-90% of the votes spread out evenly over SGP, ChristenUnie and CDA (each between 25-35%). CDA in Urk usually got more votes in national elections than in local elections, while ChristenUnie&#x27;s support is sometimes twice locally compared to what it receives from Urk voters in national elections (this is sometimes attributed to the apparent left-wing leanings of the ChristenUnie nationally, while ChristenUnie in Urk tends to be more conservative). SGP&#x27;s support locally is not much different from its support in national elections.

However, in recent years a few changes in voting patterns occurred, such as a growing support for national protest parties such as the LPF or Geert Wilders&#x27; PVV Freedom Party. Also, voting patterns these days tend to show bigger swings, as shown in 2010&#x27;s and 2012&#x27;s national elections in which CDA lost 11% and 13% respectively, and in 2011&#x27;s regional elections, in which ChristenUnie lost 18%. In 2012, orthodox-Christian SGP even registered an absolute majority with 51.2% of the vote. (In the European Elections of 2014, the combined ChristenUnie/SGP list even registered 78% of the vote).

Support for established left wing parties, such as the Labour Party or the Socialist Party, remains minimal.

== Dialect ==

One of the oldest and most distinctive dialects of Dutch is the language spoken in Urk. Nearly everyone in the village speaks this dialect and uses it in daily life. The dialect deviates considerably from contemporary standard Dutch and has preserved many old characteristics that disappeared from standard Dutch a long time ago. The Urkish dialect also includes elements that are older than standard Dutch and were never part of the standard language. For example, the old word for &quot;father&quot; in the Urkish dialect is . The dialect developed this way because until World War II, Urk was an island and could be reached only by boat. Radio was unknown, and the poor population did not have much money for newspapers and books. Until the modern era, primary education for the children typically lasted only two years; afterwards children had to help maintain the family, and formal schooling ended.

Linguistic classifications have assigned &quot;the dialect of Urk&quot; or &quot;Urk&quot; into an own dialect group.

The Urkish dialect has more vowel sounds than standard Dutch and each vowel has short and long forms. The pronunciation of vowels deviates from standard Dutch and is closer to English.

Because living conditions in Urk in historical times were very poor, young girls (typically about age 11 or 12) would frequently leave the island to become domestic servants, mostly in or around Amsterdam. They often served with Jewish families. After a few years, they would return to Urk to form families of their own. As a result of this practice, the Urkish dialect absorbed some loanwords from the Amsterdam dialect and also from Yiddish. For instance, the Yiddish &quot;Shnur&quot; for &quot;sister-in-law&quot; became the Urkish &quot;Snoar&quot; (identical meaning); the Hebrew &quot;Kallah&quot; () for &quot;bride&quot; became the Urkish &quot;Kalletjen&quot;, meaning &quot;girlfriend&quot; (literally &quot;little bride&quot;).

When Napoleon occupied the Netherlands, many French words were incorporated into both standard Dutch and Urkish. Just as for standard Dutch, French words often changed form when incorporated into Urkish. The Urkish dialect has always been primarily a spoken language, and there are not many old texts written in the dialect. Only in recent years have people begun to write prose and poetry in the Urkish dialect. There are Urkers who have translated Bible books into Urkish, such as the book of Psalms.

Urk is no longer an island and exposure to the standard Dutch through the media is widespread. However, the distinctive Urkish dialect is still alive.

==Folktales==

===Ommelebommelestien===
A famous Urkish folktale is the story parents tell their children when they want to know where the babies come from. The tale involves a large exposed rock which can be seen in the IJsselmeer about from the shore. This stone is known as the &quot;Ommelebommelestien&quot;. Urkers often tell their children that there are two kinds of people-- &quot;vreemden&quot; (strangers) and &quot;Urkers&quot; (people from Urk). Strangers are usually born from a cabbage, or a stork brings them to their new parents, but Urkers come from a large stone which lies about from the shores of their former island. Nowadays, the stone is usually called &quot;Ommelebommelestien&quot; (Ommel-Bommel Stone), but in former times it was called &quot;Ommelmoerstien&quot;: &quot;moer&quot; means &quot;mother&#x27;s&quot; in the Urkish dialect. In the tale, a stork comes all the way from Egypt to put babies in the stone. When the baby is about to be born, the baby&#x27;s father is said to have to go to Schokland to pick up the key that gives access to the stone. So when an Urkish man is asked if he has been to Schokland, he is actually being asked if he has children. In the older days, when both Urk and Schokland were still islands in the Zuiderzee, the father had to take the obstetrician in his boat and row from Urk to Schokland to get the key, and then from Schokland to the Ommelebommelestien to get the baby. Nowadays he would be able to go to Schokland by car, but according to the legend he still has to row. The door to the stone is somewhere below sea level, so it is difficult to find. Once the door was found, a small price had to be paid for the baby: traditionally one Dutch guilder for a girl but two for a boy. The mother was said to be kept in bed with a nail through her right foot. There she would celebrate that she had just become a mother.

== Urk and the arts ==

The prolific Dutch writer Albert Cornelis Baantjer was born here. Baantjer is mainly known for his large series of detective novels revolving around police inspector De Cock and his side-kick, sergeant Vledder.

Writer Jef Last lived on Urk for several years from 1932 onwards. He wrote several articles about Urk for one of the most progressive Dutch magazines, &#x27;De Groene Amsterdammer&#x27;. While living here, he fell in love with a fisherman, and was inspired to write &quot;Zuiderzee&quot;. This novel deals with the love between two fishermen living on Urk and was one of the first, if not the first novel in Dutch literature to openly deal with homosexuality.

The Dutch writer, painter and resistance hero Willem Arondeus spent some time on Urk from 1920. While residing on Urk, during 1922, he wrote &#x27;Afzijdige Strofen&#x27;, a collection of twenty homo-erotic poems which were posthumously published in 2001.

==Demographics==

Year 2018:
*Birth Rate: 20.3 per 1000
*Death Rate: 3.24 per 1000
*NGR: +1.90% per year.

The birth rate of the municipality of Urk is the highest in the Netherlands as of 2016 (and highest in previous years). But like many other places in the Netherlands this number declined to 18.7% (down from 30.8% in 1988). In 1988 only Zeewolde had a slightly higher birth rate at 31.3%, but the birth rate Urk remained the second highest. The total fertility rate declined to 2.6 (down from 3.9 in 1988).

==Rail Links==

Urk has no railway station but the nearest stations are Kampen, Dronten and Lelystad, each approximately away. This makes Urk one of the most isolated places in the Netherlands as far as railway connections are concerned.

<text>Zeewolde () is a municipality and a town in the Flevoland province in the central Netherlands. It has a population of approximately 24,000 (2024). It is situated in the polder of Flevoland with the small lake called the Wolderwijd to the east. To the south is a large deciduous forest called the . The area to the west is principally agricultural.

Zeewolde is known for its landscape and nature art. The best-known art work is &quot;Sea Level&quot; by Richard Serra, located in the De Wetering landscape park.

In the Hulkesteinse forest there is the naturist resort , with recreation bungalows, a camp site, and the possibility of day recreation.

== History ==
The municipality of Zeewolde was founded in 1984 and is therefore one of the youngest in the Netherlands. Before 1984, the area was administered by the &quot; (OLZIJ) (), founded by the Dutch national government after the province of Flevoland was created. The name &#x27;Zeewolde&#x27; was always meant to be used during the planning stages, but on various locations. 

Zeewolde&#x27;s first inhabitants were the so-called &#x27;pioneers&#x27;, moving in from the &#x27;old land&#x27; to the newly created polder in 1979. They were mostly farmers and in the beginning stages deprived of amenities such as electricity or tap water. The planned village was then mostly meant to provide services to the neighbouring farmers. 
Alongside the farmers, two holiday resorts were founded in the area.

In August 1980, the Zeewolde advisory board, headed by Han Lammers who was at the time the head of the OLZIJ, met for the first time. In February 1982, municipal elections were held and the first &quot; (Structural plan) was drawn, envisaging the village to grow to 15.000 inhabitants. The actual village itself was started in 1983, after which in 1984 Zeewolde became a municipality in its own right. On 23 February 1984, the official first inhabitant of the village of Zeewolde was handed the keys of his house.

In August 2024 it was reported that the remnants of Hulkenstein Castle might have been found in a lake near Zeewolde.

==Transportation==

There are no railway stations in the municipality, but the nearest stations are Harderwijk, Nijkerk and the stations in Almere. There are bus connections to the stations in Harderwijk, Nijkerk and Amersfoort, and to the central station in Almere.

<text>William Holman Hunt (2 April 1827 – 7 September 1910) was an English painter and one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His paintings were notable for their great attention to detail, vivid colour, and elaborate symbolism. These features were influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle, according to whom the world itself should be read as a system of visual signs. For Hunt it was the duty of the artist to reveal the correspondence between sign and fact. Of all the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Hunt remained most true to their ideals throughout his career. He was always keen to maximise the popular appeal and public visibility of his works.

==Biography==
Born at Cheapside, City of London, as William Hobman Hunt, to warehouse manager William Hunt (1800–1856) and Sarah (–1884), daughter of William Hobman, of Rotherhithe Hunt adopted the name &quot;Holman&quot; instead of &quot;Hobman&quot; when he discovered that a clerk had misspelled the name that way after his baptism at the Anglican church of Saint Mary the Virgin, Ewell. The Hobman family were wealthy, and it was thought that Sarah had made an unequal marriage. After eventually entering the Royal Academy art schools, having initially been rejected, Hunt rebelled against the influence of its founder Sir Joshua Reynolds. He formed the Pre-Raphaelite movement in 1848, after meeting the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Along with John Everett Millais they sought to revitalise art by emphasising the detailed observation of the natural world in a spirit of quasi-religious devotion to truth. This religious approach was influenced by the spiritual qualities of medieval art, in opposition to the alleged rationalism of the Renaissance embodied by Raphael. He had many pupils including Robert Braithwaite Martineau.

Hunt married twice. After a failed engagement to his model Annie Miller, in 1861 he married Fanny Waugh, who later modelled for the figure of &quot;Isabella&quot;. When, at the end of 1866, she died in childbirth in Italy, he sculpted her tomb at Fiesole, having it brought down to the English Cemetery in Florence, beside the tomb of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. He had a close connection with St. Mark&#x27;s Church in Florence, and paid for the communion chalice inscribed in memory of his wife. His second wife, Edith, was Fanny&#x27;s youngest sister. At the time it was illegal in Great Britain to marry one&#x27;s deceased wife&#x27;s sister, so the two of them travelled abroad and married at Neuchâtel (in francophone Switzerland) in November 1875. This led to a grave conflict with other family members, notably his former Pre-Raphaelite colleague Thomas Woolner, who had once been in love with Fanny and had married the middle sister, Alice Waugh.

Hunt&#x27;s works were not initially successful, and were widely attacked in the art press for their alleged clumsiness and ugliness. He achieved some early note for his intensely naturalistic scenes of modern rural and urban life, such as &quot;The Hireling Shepherd&quot; and &quot;The Awakening Conscience&quot;. However, it was for his religious paintings that he became famous, initially &quot;The Light of the World&quot; (1851–1853), now in the chapel at Keble College, Oxford, England; a later version (1900) toured the world and now has its home in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. Hunt worked at his home in Prospect Place (now Cheyne Walk), Chelsea, London.

In the mid-1850s Hunt travelled to the Holy Land in search of accurate topographical and ethnographical material for further religious works, and to employ his &quot;powers to make more tangible Jesus Christ&#x27;s history and teaching&quot;; there he painted &quot;The Scapegoat&quot;, &quot;The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple&quot;, and &quot;The Shadow of Death&quot;, along with many landscapes of the region. Hunt also painted many works based on poems, such as &quot;Isabella&quot; and &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;. He eventually built his own house in Jerusalem.

He eventually had to abandon painting because failing eyesight meant that he could not achieve the quality that he wanted. His last major works, including a large version of &quot;The Light of the World&quot; hanging in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, were completed with the help of his assistant, Edward Robert Hughes.

Holman Hunt lived and had a studio at 18 Melbury Road in Holland Park, West London, from 1903 until his death. He died on 7 September 1910 and was buried at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London.

==Awards and commemoration==
Hunt published an autobiography in 1905. Many of his late writings are attempts to control the interpretation of his work. That year, he was appointed to the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. At the end of his life, he lived in Sonning-on-Thames. 18 Melbury Road has a blue plaque commemorating Hunt, added in 1923. 

Hunt&#x27;s personal life was the subject of Diana Holman-Hunt&#x27;s book &quot;My Grandfather, his Life and Loves&quot;.

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was depicted in two BBC period dramas. The first, &quot;The Love School&quot;, in 1975, starred Bernard Lloyd as Hunt. The second was &quot;Desperate Romantics&quot;, in which Hunt is played by Rafe Spall.

Facing Mar Elias Monastery is a stone bench erected by the wife of the painter, who painted some of his major works at this spot. The bench is inscribed with biblical verses in Hebrew, Greek, Arabic and English.

<text>Innovation is the practical implementation of ideas that result in the introduction of new goods or services or improvement in offering goods or services. ISO TC 279 in the standard ISO 56000:2020 defines innovation as &quot;a new or changed entity, realizing or redistributing value&quot;. Others have different definitions; a common element in the definitions is a focus on newness, improvement, and spread of ideas or technologies.

Innovation often takes place through the development of more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, art works
or business models that innovators make available to markets, governments and society.

Innovation is related to, but not the same as, &quot;invention&quot;: innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (i.e. new / improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in a market or society, and not all innovations require a new invention.

Technical innovation often manifests itself via the engineering process when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is &quot;exnovation&quot;.

==Definition==
Surveys of the literature on innovation have found a variety of definitions. In 2009, Baregheh et al. found around 60 definitions in different scientific papers, while a 2014 survey found over 40. Based on their survey, Baragheh et al. attempted to formulate a multidisciplinary definition and arrived at the following:&quot;Innovation is the multi-stage process whereby organizations transform ideas into new/improved products, service or processes, in order to advance, compete and differentiate themselves successfully in their marketplace&quot;
In a study of how the software industry considers innovation, the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete. Crossan and Apaydin built on the definition given in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Oslo Manual: 
American sociologist Everett Rogers, defined it as follows:&quot;An idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption&quot;
According to Alan Altshuler and Robert D. Behn, innovation includes original invention and creative use. These writers define innovation as generation, admission and realization of new ideas, products, services and processes.

Two main dimensions of innovation are degree of novelty (i.e. whether an innovation is new to the firm, new to the market, new to the industry, or new to the world) and kind of innovation (i.e. whether it is process or product-service system innovation). Organizational researchers have also distinguished innovation separately from creativity, by providing an updated definition of these two related constructs:

Peter Drucker wrote:

=== Creativity and innovation ===
In general, innovation is distinguished from creativity by its emphasis on the implementation of creative ideas in an economic setting. Amabile and Pratt in 2016, drawing on the literature, distinguish between creativity (&quot;the production of novel and useful ideas by an individual or small group of individuals working together&quot;) and innovation (&quot;the successful implementation of creative ideas within an organization&quot;).

===Economics and innovation===
In 1957 the economist Robert Solow was able to demonstrate that economic growth had two components. The first component could be attributed to growth in production including wage labour and capital. The second component was found to be productivity. Ever since, economic historians have tried to explain the process of innovation itself, rather than assuming that technological inventions and technological progress result in productivity growth.

The concept of innovation emerged after the Second World War, mostly thanks to the works of Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950) who described the economic effects of innovation processes as &quot;Constructive destruction&quot;. Today, consistent neo-Schumpeterian scholars see innovation not as neutral or apolitical processes. Rather, innovation can be seen as socially constructed processes. Therefore, its conception depends on the political and societal context in which innovation is taking place. According to Shannon Walsh, &quot;innovation today is best understood as innovation under capital&quot; (p. 346). This means that the current hegemonic purpose for innovation is capital valorisation and profit maximization, exemplified by the appropriation of knowledge (e.g., through patenting), the widespread practice of Planned obsolescence (incl. lack of repairability by design), and the Jevons paradox, that describes negative consequences of eco-efficiency as energy-reducing effects tend to trigger mechanisms leading to energy-increasing effects.

== Types ==
Several frameworks have been proposed for defining types of innovation.

=== Sustaining vs disruptive innovation ===

One framework proposed by Clayton Christensen draws a distinction between sustaining and disruptive innovations. Sustaining innovation is the improvement of a product or service based on the known needs of current customers (e.g. faster microprocessors, flat screen televisions). Disruptive innovation in contrast refers to a process by which a new product or service creates a new market (e.g. transistor radio, free crowdsourced encyclopedia, etc.), eventually displacing established competitors. According to Christensen, disruptive innovations are critical to long-term success in business.

Disruptive innovation is often enabled by disruptive technology. Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani define foundational technology as having the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational technology tends to transform business operating models as entirely new business models emerge over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of technological and institutional change that gain momentum more slowly. The advent of the packet-switched communication protocol TCP/IP—originally introduced in 1972 to support a single use case for United States Department of Defense electronic communication (email), and which gained widespread adoption only in the mid-1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web—is a foundational technology.

=== Four types of innovation model ===
Another framework was suggested by Henderson and Clark. They divide innovation into four types;
* Radical innovation: &quot;establishes a new dominant design and, hence, a new set of core design concepts embodied in components that are linked together in a new architecture.&quot; (p. 11)
* Incremental innovation: &quot;refines and extends an established design. Improvement occurs in individual components, but the underlying core design concepts, and the links between them, remain the same.&quot; (p. 11)
* Architectural innovation: &quot;innovation that changes only the relationships between them [the core design concepts]&quot; (p. 12)
* Modular Innovation: &quot;innovation that changes only the core design concepts of a technology&quot; (p. 12)

While Henderson and Clark as well as Christensen talk about technical innovation there are other kinds of innovation as well, such as service innovation and organizational innovation.

===Non-economic innovation===
As distinct from business-centric views of innovation concentrating on generating profit for a firm, other types of innovation include: social innovation, religious innovation,
sustainable innovation (or green innovation),
and responsible innovation.

=== Open innovation ===
One type of innovation that has been the focus of recent literature is open innovation or &quot;crowd sourcing.&quot; Open innovation refers to the use of individuals outside of an organizational context who have no expertise in a given area to solve complex problems.

=== User innovation ===
Similar to open innovation, user innovation is when companies rely on users of their goods and services to come up with, help to develop, and even help to implement new ideas.

==History==

Innovation must be understood in the historical setting in which its processes were and are taking place. The first full-length discussion about innovation was published by the Greek philosopher and historian Xenophon (430–355 BCE). He viewed the concept as multifaceted and connected it to political action. The word for innovation that he uses, &quot;kainotomia&quot;, had previously occurred in two plays by Aristophanes ( – BCE). Plato (died BCE) discussed innovation in his &quot;Laws&quot; dialogue and was not very fond of the concept. He was skeptical to it both in culture (dancing and art) and in education (he did not believe in introducing new games and toys to the kids). Aristotle (384–322 BCE) did not like organizational innovations: he believed that all possible forms of organization had been discovered.

Before the 4th century in Rome, the words &quot;novitas&quot; and &quot;res nova / nova res&quot; were used with either negative or positive judgment on the innovator. This concept meant &quot;renewing&quot; and was incorporated into the new Latin verb word &quot;innovo&quot; (&quot;I renew&quot; or &quot;I restore&quot;) in the centuries that followed. The &quot;Vulgate&quot; version of the Bible (late 4th century CE) used the word in spiritual as well as political contexts. It also appeared in poetry, mainly with spiritual connotations, but was also connected to political, material and cultural aspects.

Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot; (1513) discusses innovation in a political setting. Machiavelli portrays it as a strategy a Prince may employ in order to cope with a constantly changing world as well as the corruption within it. Here innovation is described as introducing change in government (new laws and institutions); Machiavelli&#x27;s later book &quot;The Discourses&quot; (1528) characterises innovation as imitation, as a return to the original that has been corrupted by people and by time. Thus for Machiavelli innovation came with positive connotations. This is however an exception in the usage of the concept of innovation from the 16th century and onward. No innovator from the renaissance until the late 19th century ever thought of applying the word innovator upon themselves, it was a word used to attack enemies.

From the 1400s through the 1600s, the concept of innovation was pejorative – the term was an early-modern synonym for &quot;rebellion&quot;, &quot;revolt&quot; and &quot;heresy&quot;. In the 1800s people promoting capitalism saw socialism as an innovation and spent a lot of energy working against it. For instance, Goldwin Smith (1823-1910) saw the spread of social innovations as an attack on money and banks. These social innovations were socialism, communism, nationalization, cooperative associations.

In the 20th century, the concept of innovation did not become popular until after the Second World War of 1939–1945. This is the point in time when people started to talk about &quot;technological&quot; product innovation and tie it to the idea of economic growth and competitive advantage. Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950), who contributed greatly to the study of innovation economics, is seen as the one who made the term popular. Schumpeter argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within, that is: innovate with better or more effective processes and products, as well as with market distribution (such as the transition from the craft shop to factory). He famously asserted that &quot;creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism&quot;. In business and in economics, innovation can provide a catalyst for growth when entrepreneurs continuously search for better ways to satisfy their consumer base with improved quality, durability, service and price - searches which may come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies. Schumpeter&#x27;s findings coincided with rapid advances in transportation and communications in the beginning of the 20th century, which had huge impacts for the economic concepts of factor endowments and comparative advantage as new combinations of resources or production techniques constantly transform markets to satisfy consumer needs. Hence, innovative behaviour becomes relevant for economic success.

== Process of innovation ==
An early model included only three phases of innovation. According to Utterback (1971), these phases were: 1) idea generation, 2) problem solving, and 3) implementation. By the time one completed phase 2, one had an invention, but until one got it to the point of having an economic impact, one did not have an innovation. Diffusion was not considered a phase of innovation. Focus at this point in time was on manufacturing.

A prime example of innovation involved the boom of Silicon Valley start-ups out of the Stanford Industrial Park. In 1957, dissatisfied employees of Shockley Semiconductor, the company of Nobel laureate William Shockley, co-inventor of the transistor, left to form an independent firm, Fairchild Semiconductor. After several years, Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector. Eventually, these founders left to start their own companies based on their own unique ideas, and then leading employees started their own firms. Over the next 20 years this process resulted in the momentous startup-company explosion of information-technology firms. Silicon Valley began as 65 new enterprises born out of Shockley&#x27;s eight former employees.

All organizations can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments. The organization requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate, in addition to employee&#x27;s core job tasks. Executives and managers have been advised to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. The world of work is changing with the increased use of technology and companies are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize or reengineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.

For instance, former Mayor Martin O&#x27;Malley pushed the City of Baltimore to use CitiStat, a performance-measurement data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on several areas from crime trends to the conditions of potholes. This system aided in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million. Even mass transit systems have innovated with hybrid bus fleets to real-time tracking at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of mobile data terminals in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine performance, mileage and other information. This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems.

Still other innovative strategies include hospitals digitizing medical information in electronic medical records. For example, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development&#x27;s HOPE VI initiatives turned severely distressed public housing in urban areas into revitalized, mixed-income environments; the Harlem Children&#x27;s Zone used a community-based approach to educate local area children; and the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s brownfield grants facilitates turning over brownfields for environmental protection, green spaces, community and commercial development.
=== Sources of innovation ===
Innovation may occur due to effort from a range of different agents, by chance, or as a result of a major system failure. According to Peter F. Drucker, the general sources of innovations are changes in industry structure, in market structure, in local and global demographics, in human perception, in the amount of available scientific knowledge, etc.
In the simplest linear model of innovation the traditionally recognized source is &quot;manufacturer innovation&quot;. This is where a person or business innovates in order to sell the innovation.

Another source of innovation is &quot;end-user innovation&quot;. This is where a person or company develops an innovation for their own (personal or in-house) use because existing products do not meet their needs. MIT economist Eric von Hippel identified end-user innovation as the most important source in his classic book on the subject, &quot;The Sources of Innovation&quot;.

The robotics engineer Joseph F. Engelberger asserts that innovations require only three things:
# a recognized need
# competent people with relevant technology
# financial support

The Kline chain-linked model of innovation places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process, and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing, design, manufacturing, and R&amp;D.

In the 21st century the Islamic State (IS) movement, while decrying religious innovations, has innovated in military tactics, recruitment, ideology and geopolitical activity.

=== Facilitating innovation ===
Innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways, with much attention now given to formal research and development (R&amp;D) for &quot;breakthrough innovations&quot;. R&amp;D help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry, medicine, engineering, and government. Yet, innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice, through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes. Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap. The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from R&amp;D, while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice – but there are many exceptions to each of these trends.

Information technology and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation. For example, the software tool company Atlassian conducts quarterly &quot;ShipIt Days&quot; in which employees may work on anything related to the company&#x27;s products. Google employees work on self-directed projects for 20% of their time (known as Innovation Time Off). Both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features.

An important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services. As a result, organizations may incorporate users in focus groups (user centered approach), work closely with so-called lead users (lead user approach), or users might adapt their products themselves. The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations. U-STIR, a project to innovate Europe&#x27;s surface transportation system, employs such workshops. Regarding this user innovation, a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities. Sometimes user-innovators may become entrepreneurs, selling their product, they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations, or they may be adopted by their suppliers. Nowadays, they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations, using methods like open source. In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning.

One technique for innovating a solution to an identified problem is to actually attempt an experiment with many possible solutions. This technique was famously used by Thomas Edison&#x27;s laboratory to find a version of the incandescent light bulb economically viable for home use, which involved searching through thousands of possible filament designs before settling on carbonized bamboo.

This technique is sometimes used in pharmaceutical drug discovery. Thousands of chemical compounds are subjected to high-throughput screening to see if they have any activity against a target molecule which has been identified as biologically significant to a disease. Promising compounds can then be studied; modified to improve efficacy and reduce side effects, evaluated for cost of manufacture; and if successful turned into treatments.

The related technique of A/B testing is often used to help optimize the design of web sites and mobile apps. This is used by major sites such as amazon.com, Facebook, Google, and Netflix. Procter &amp; Gamble uses computer-simulated products and online user panels to conduct larger numbers of experiments to guide the design, packaging, and shelf placement of consumer products. Capital One uses this technique to drive credit card marketing offers.

== Goals and failures of innovation ==
Scholars have argued that the main purpose for innovation today is profit maximization and capital valorisation. Consequently, programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and growth objectives, to the business plan, and to market competitive positioning. Davila et al. (2006) note, &quot;Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone... Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth, and for increasing bottom-line results&quot;. One survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by: improved quality, creation of new markets, extension of the product range, reduced labor costs, improved production processes, reduced materials cost, reduced environmental damage, replacement of products/services, reduced energy consumption, and conformance to regulations.

Different goals are appropriate for different products, processes, and services. According to Andrea Vaona and Mario Pianta, some example goals of innovation could stem from two different types of technological strategies: &quot;technological competitiveness&quot; and &quot;active price competitiveness&quot;. &quot;Technological competitiveness&quot; may have a tendency to be pursued by smaller firms and can be characterized as &quot;efforts for market-oriented innovation, such as a strategy of market expansion and patenting activity.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;active price competitiveness&quot; is geared toward process innovations that lead to efficiency and flexibility, which tend to be pursued by large, established firms as they seek to expand their market foothold. Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the organization.

=== Organization-internal innovation failures ===
Failure of organizational innovation programs has been widely researched and the causes vary considerably. Some causes are external to the organization and outside its influence of control. Others are internal and ultimately within the control of the organization. Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself. David O&#x27;Sullivan wrote that causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types: poor goal definition, poor alignment of actions to goals, poor participation in teams, poor monitoring of results, and poor communication and access to information.

=== Environmental and social innovation failures ===
Innovation is generally framed as an inherently positive force, delivering growth and prosperity for all, and is often deemed as both inevitable and unstoppable. In this sense, future innovations are often hailed as solutions to current problems, such as climate change. This business-as-usual approach would mean continued and increased globalization as well as quick innovation cycles which supposedly will maximize the competitiveness of processes, in the end leading to Eco-economic decoupling or Green growth. Yet, it is unclear whether innovative solutions will be capable of solving the climate crisis: According to Mario Giampietro and Silvio Funtowicz (2020), this positive framing of innovation &quot;demonstrates [a] lack of understanding of the biophysical roots of the economic process and the seriousness of the sustainability crisis&quot;. This is due to the fact that innovation can be understood in its specific historic and cultural context: The prevailing hegemonic view on innovation, as emphasized by Ben Robra et al. (2023), aligns closely with capitalist mode of production, shown by the mantra of &#x27;innovate or die.&#x27; From this viewpoint, innovation is primarily driven by the imperative of capital accumulation, serving the sole purpose of increasing returns, neglecting societal needs such as a clean environment or social equality and in general the biophysical limits of our planet.

==Diffusion==

Diffusion of innovation research was first started in 1903 by seminal researcher Gabriel Tarde, who first plotted the S-shaped diffusion curve. Tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that include:
# knowledge
# forming an attitude
# a decision to adopt or reject
# implementation and use
# confirmation of the decision

Once innovation occurs, innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups. This process has been proposed that the lifecycle of innovations can be described using the &#x27;s-curve&#x27; or diffusion curve. The s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time. In the early stage of a particular innovation, growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself. At some point, customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly. New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue. Towards the end of its lifecycle, growth slows and may even begin to decline. In the later stages, no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return.

The s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have &quot;product life&quot; – i.e., a start-up phase, a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline. In fact, the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve, and never produce normal returns.

Innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones. Successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards. In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology. The second shows an emerging technology that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth. The length of life will depend on many factors.

==Measuring innovation==
Measuring innovation is inherently difficult as it implies commensurability so that comparisons can be made in quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service. Nevertheless, Edison et al. in their review of literature on innovation management found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions; i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.

There are two different types of measures for innovation: the organizational level and the political level.

=== Organizational-level ===
:The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest to the largest company. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys, workshops, consultants, or internal benchmarking. There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation. Corporate measurements are generally structured around balanced scorecards which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances, innovation process efficiency, employees&#x27; contribution and motivation, as well benefits for customers. Measured values will vary widely between businesses, covering for example new product revenue, spending in R&amp;D, time to market, customer and employee perception &amp; satisfaction, number of patents, additional sales resulting from past innovations.

=== Political-level ===
:For the political level, measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region competitive advantage through innovation. In this context, organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks, such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management. The OECD Oslo Manual (1992) suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation. Some people consider the Oslo Manual complementary to the Frascati Manual from 1963. The new Oslo Manual from 2018 takes a wider perspective to innovation, and includes marketing and organizational innovation. These standards are used for example in the European Community Innovation Surveys.

Other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure, for example, investment in R&amp;D (Research and Development) as percentage of GNP (Gross National Product). Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring. The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions. The EU Lisbon Strategy has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R&amp;D should be 3% of GDP.

===Indicators===
Many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the &quot;science and technology mode&quot; (S&amp;T-mode or STI-mode), while the &quot;learning by doing, using and interacting mode&quot; (DUI-mode) is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done. For example, an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment, but lacks crucial doing, using and interacting tasks important for innovation.

A common industry view (unsupported by empirical evidence) is that comparative cost-effectiveness research is a form of price control which reduces returns to industry, and thus limits R&amp;D expenditure, stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets.
Some academics claim cost-effectiveness research is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords &quot;truly significant&quot; therapeutic advances (i.e. providing &quot;health gain&quot;) higher prices than free market mechanisms. Such value-based pricing has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse.

An Australian academic developed the case that national comparative cost-effectiveness analysis systems should be viewed as measuring &quot;health innovation&quot; as an evidence-based policy concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets, a method which requires strong anti-trust laws to be effective, on the basis that both methods of assessing pharmaceutical innovations are mentioned in annex 2C.1 of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement.

===Indices===
Several indices attempt to measure innovation and rank entities based on these measures, such as:
* Bloomberg Innovation Index
* &quot;Bogota Manual&quot; similar to the Oslo Manual, is focused on Latin America and the Caribbean countries.
* &quot;Creative Class&quot; developed by Richard Florida
* EIU Innovation Ranking
* Global Competitiveness Report
* Global Innovation Index (GII), by INSEAD
* Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) Index
* Innovation 360 – From the World Bank. Aggregates innovation indicators (and more) from a number of different public sources
* Innovation Capacity Index (ICI) published by a large number of international professors working in a collaborative fashion. The top scorers of ICI 2009–2010 were: 1. Sweden 82.2; 2. Finland 77.8; and 3. United States 77.5
* Innovation Index, developed by the Indiana Business Research Center, to measure innovation capacity at the county or regional level in the United States
* Innovation Union Scoreboard, developed by the European Union
* innovationsindikator for Germany, developed by the Federation of German Industries (Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie) in 2005
* INSEAD Innovation Efficacy Index
* International Innovation Index, produced jointly by The Boston Consulting Group, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and its nonpartisan research affiliate The Manufacturing Institute, is a worldwide index measuring the level of innovation in a country; NAM describes it as the &quot;largest and most comprehensive global index of its kind&quot;
* Management Innovation Index – Model for Managing Intangibility of Organizational Creativity: Management Innovation Index
* NYCEDC Innovation Index, by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, tracks New York City&#x27;s &quot;transformation into a center for high-tech innovation. It measures innovation in the City&#x27;s growing science and technology industries and is designed to capture the effect of innovation on the City&#x27;s economy&quot;
* OECD Oslo Manual is focused on North America, Europe, and other rich economies
* State Technology and Science Index, developed by the Milken Institute, is a U.S.-wide benchmark to measure the science and technology capabilities that furnish high paying jobs based around key components
* World Competitiveness Scoreboard

===Rankings===
Common areas of focus include: high-tech companies, manufacturing, patents, post secondary education, research and development, and research personnel. The left ranking of the top 10 countries below is based on the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index. However, studies may vary widely; for example the Global Innovation Index 2016 ranks Switzerland as number one wherein countries like South Korea, Japan, and China do not even make the top ten.



=== Rate of innovation ===
In 2005 Jonathan Huebner, a physicist working at the Pentagon&#x27;s Naval Air Warfare Center, argued on the basis of both U.S. patents and world technological breakthroughs, per capita, that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in 1873 and has been slowing ever since. In his article, he asked &quot;Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages?&quot; In later comments to &quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine, Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in 2024 equivalent to that of the Dark Ages, he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves.

John Smart criticized the claim and asserted that technological singularity researcher Ray Kurzweil and others showed a &quot;clear trend of acceleration, not deceleration&quot; when it came to innovations. The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in, citing Second Life and eHarmony as proof of accelerating innovation; to which Huebner replied.
However, Huebner&#x27;s findings were confirmed in 2010 with U.S. Patent Office data. and in a 2012 paper.

===Innovation and development===
The theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major international development actors such as DFID, Gates Foundation&#x27;s use of the Grand Challenge funding model, and USAID&#x27;s Global Development Lab. Networks have been established to support innovation in development, such as D-Lab at MIT. Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in developing countries, such as DFID&#x27;s Global Innovation Fund, Human Development Innovation Fund, and (in partnership with USAID) the Global Development Innovation Ventures.

The United States has to continue to play on the same level of playing field as its competitors in federal research. This can be achieved being strategically innovative through investment in basic research and science&quot;.

==Government policies==

Given its effects on efficiency, quality of life, and productive growth, innovation is a key driver in improving society and economy. Consequently, policymakers have worked to develop environments that will foster innovation, from funding research and development to establishing regulations that do not inhibit innovation, funding the development of innovation clusters, and using public purchasing and standardisation to &#x27;pull&#x27; innovation through.

For instance, experts are advocating that the U.S. federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation performance metrics, strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation economic development initiatives, especially to strengthen regional clusters. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes, a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision manufacturing, information technology, and clean energy, other areas of national concern would be tackled including government debt, carbon footprint, and oil dependence. The U.S. Economic Development Administration understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative. The United States also has to integrate her supply-chain and improve her applies research capability and downstream process innovation.

Many countries recognize the importance of innovation including Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Germany&#x27;s Federal Ministry of Education and Research; and the Ministry of Science and Technology in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Russia&#x27;s innovation programme is the Medvedev modernisation programme which aims to create a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation. The Government of Western Australia has established a number of innovation incentives for government departments. Landgate was the first Western Australian government agency to establish its Innovation Program.

Some regions have taken a proactive role in supporting innovation. Many regional governments are setting up innovation agencies to strengthen regional capabilities. Business incubators were first introduced in 1959 and subsequently nurtured by governments around the world. Such &quot;incubators&quot;, located close to knowledge clusters (mostly research-based) like universities or other government excellence centres – aim primarily to channel generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national economic growth.

In 2009, the municipality of Medellin, Colombia created Ruta N to transform the city into a knowledge city.

== Counter-hegemonic views on innovation ==
Innovation in the prevailing hegemonic view today mostly refers to &#x27;innovation under capital&#x27;, due to the prevailing capitalist nature of the global economy. In contrast, Robra et al. (2023) propose a counter-hegemonic view on innovation. This alternative lens revises the centrality of capital accumulation as the primary goal of innovation. Instead of being solely driven by profit motives, a counter-hegemonic understanding sees innovation as a means to create user-value, with a focus on satisfying societal needs. This view on innovation is underpinned by open access to knowledge, adaptability, repairability, and maintenance of products as well as Eco-sufficiency, defining progress not by efficiency but by staying within planetary boundaries, thereby challenging the hegemonic belief in limitless growth. This perspective is exemplified by commons-based peer production (CBPP), offering an alternative vision of innovation that prioritizes conviviality over relentless competition. In essence, this counter-hegemonic view describes a more socially and ecologically conscious approach to innovation, striving for a balance between technological progress and human wellbeing.

<text>Almelo () is a municipality and a city in the eastern Netherlands. The main population centres in the town are Aadorp, Almelo, Mariaparochie, and Bornerbroek.

Almelo has about 72,000 inhabitants in the middle of the rolling countryside of Twente, with the industrial centres of Enschede and Hengelo as close neighbours but also with tourist towns like Ootmarsum, Delden and Markelo only a bicycle ride away. 

Almelo received city rights in 1394. Within the city limits lies the castle of the Counts of Almelo. Located in the city centre is Huize Almelo, a castle that in its current form dates back to 1662 (This castle is not open to the public).

==History==
At the end of the 19th century textile emerged as a major employer and drew many workers to Almelo, at first from within the Netherlands. Since the 1960s workers from Spain and Turkey came to Almelo. The first mosque of the Netherlands was built in Almelo in 1976 for the Turkish population of the city. Almelo also has a sizeable number of Armenians who built their own Armenian Apostolic Church in 2003.

In the 1970s the industry dwindled and most factories were relocated to countries with cheaper labour. Some factories remain in the city centre and are now in use for apartments or offices.

Finds from around 800 CE., the remains of two farmhouses and the grave of a man buried with his armour, a sword, lance and 16 silver denarii coined by Charlemagne near two farmhouses of the same age suggest inhabitation in the ninth century. The first historical mention of Borne, under the name &quot;Borghende&quot; dates from 1206 in a document which transfers churches in Steenwijk and Borne and their possessions by Fredericus, the abbot of the monastery in Ruinen to the bishop of Utrecht, Dirk van Are in return for possessions in Drenthe.

The earliest phases of Borne center around the &quot;Meijershof&quot;, which came into possession of the abbot of Ruinen in 1142.

Until the beginning of the industrial age, Borne was an agricultural community, characterised by plaggen soil and extensive cattle farming. The main crops were rye and buckwheat. Several &quot;landweren&quot;, defensive earthworks consisting or earthen walls overgrown with blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and blackberries are still visible in the landscape.

Borne was originally the &quot;&quot; (judicial district) Borne, made up of the &quot;Marke Senderen&quot; (Zenderen) and &quot;Bi den Broeke&quot; (lit. &quot;by the brook&quot;, Bornerbroek) and the hamlet of Hertme. In 1655 Hertme has evolved into an independent &quot;marke&quot;.

<text>Dalfsen (; Dutch Low Saxon: ) is a municipality and a town in the Salland region of the Dutch province of Overijssel. The municipality of Dalfsen was increased to its current size on 1 January 2001 through the amalgamation of the municipalities of Nieuwleusen and Dalfsen. A variety of Sallands is spoken here by segment of the population.

==History==
The name first appears in documents in 1231. Due to the closeness of Kasteel Rechteren, Dalfsen is one of several towns along the Overijssel section of the Vecht river never to have received city rights.

In 2015, archaeologists found a burial ground dating from the TRB-period (3000-2750 BC) containing 141 burial pits. The TRB dates back to the last phase of the Middle Neolithic period, which is known for its megalithic monuments in northern Europe.

<text>Hellendoorn (; Tweants: &quot;Heldern&quot; or &quot;Healndoorn&quot;) is a municipality and town in the middle of the Dutch province of Overijssel. As of 2019, the municipality had a population of 35,808.

There is an amusement park near the town of Hellendoorn called . At the outskirts of the town there is an ice cream factory from Unilever, where Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s is produced for the European market.

== Population centres ==
The municipality comprises:

Towns:
* Nijverdal (where the town hall is located)

Hamlets:
* Daarle
* Daarlerveen
* Egede
* 
* 
* (former hamlet, now an integrated part of Nijverdal)

===Topography===
&quot;Dutch topographic map of the municipality of Hellendoorn, June 2015&quot;

== Geography ==

The central part of the municipality consists of a hilly and sparsely populated area that extends south into the municipality of Rijssen-Holten, called the Sallandse Heuvelrug (Salland Ridge). The highest point lies at about above sea level and is part of the Noetselerberg. A large chunk of the area is covered by forest, but there are also heathlands. This scenery is now part of the Sallandse Heuvelrug National Park.

Originally part of the region of Salland, Hellendoorn is now administratively considered part of Twente; a fact reflected in the inclusion of Hellendoorn in the city region of Twente (&quot;Kaderwetgebied Regio Twente&quot;) as defined by the Dutch government.

== History ==
The municipality of Hellendoorn is the only place in the Netherlands where gold mining took place.

The Germans operated a V-2 launching platform near the town of Hellendoorn during World War II, harassing the city of Antwerp.

On March, 22nd 1945, Nijverdal was severely bombed by allied bombers who were targeting the German Reichskommissar of Austrian origin Arthur Seyss-Inquart. Seyss-Inquart was fleeing the advancing Allied forces and had set up his temporary headquarters in the Reformed School in Nijverdal, but had already left town at the time of the bombing. Over 70 people were killed, mainly at the Grotestraat.

A small part of the film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; was filmed near Hellendoorn.

In 1955, part of the municipality of Wierden was annexed (Eversberg, Konijnenbelt, Slettenhaar and Lochter) which is the only part of the municipality located on originally Twente soil. In the late-1970s the quarter of &#x27;het Lochter&#x27; arose here.

== Notable residents ==
* Ernst Bakker (1946 in Hellendoorn – 2014) a Dutch politician
* Douwe Draaisma (born 1953 in Nijverdal) a Dutch psychologist and academic
* Herman Ponsteen (born 1953 in Hellendoorn) Dutch track cyclist who won silver at the 1976 Summer Olympics

<text>Hengelo (; Tweants: ) is a city in the eastern part of the Netherlands, in the Twente region, in the province of Overijssel. It is part of a larger urban area that also includes Enschede, Borne, Almelo and Oldenzaal.

Due to its geomorphology, being situated relatively low in the landscape, Hengelo is a place where streams converge. By consequence, it became a crossroad, inhabited early on in history, which has made it into an infrastructural hub and an industrial centre today. For the 19th century industry, water was needed for bleaching textile, while factories also needed water for their steam engines, and for cooling. Over time, Hengelo became known as &quot;metaalstad&quot;, for its machine factories and electrical engineering companies. In addition, salt mining developed into an important industry too, which also led to the production of chemical derivatives. 

Due to its strategical importance, Hengelo was bombed during World War II. Afterwards, a reconstruction plan was developed that made it into a modern city, partly at the cost of still remaining historical structures. Well-known Dutch planners and architects have left their traces inside and outside the city. Among their most notable efforts are several residential areas, being inspired by the principles of the garden city movement. Due to the vicinity of University of Twente and ArtEZ University of Arts, in Enschede, many students and graduates have come to live and work in Hengelo. Besides economic growth, this has also contributed to the city&#x27;s development in regard to arts and culture.

*Hengelo
*Oele

==History==
In what is known as the historical centre of Hengelo, archaeologists have found a camp site for hunters and gatherers, indicating that the location was inhabited during the Mesolithic, between 12,000 and 5,000 years BP. The area has most likely been continuously inhabited ever since. On the same site, finds from the Iron Age and Roman times have been excavated too. Different settements, moreover, existed within the current municipality. Recent archaeological research in the north of Hengelo has led to the discovery of a prehistoric grave field, as well as another settlement from Roman times, with pottery and other artefacts corresponding to the Weser–Rhine Germanic tradition. 

In the mid 13th century, an estate was built, called Huys Hengelo, which existed till 1826, when it was demolished. A village grew around the estate, including a church and a cemetery. During the Spanish occupation of the Netherlands, Huys Hengelo was the centre of several fights and revolts. 

The municipality of Hengelo was founded in 1802, which by then consisted of a few hundred farms and agricultural workers&#x27; houses. 

Hengelo was never granted city rights, as it was a village until its expansion in the 19th century during the industrial revolution. In that period, however, various landmark buildings were erected, especially the Waterstaatskerk (1839), and the Lambertusbasiliek (1890), a Roman Catholic basilica built in 1890 devoted to Saint Lambert.

After the construction of its railway station, in 1866, industrial development accelerated, with a focus on technology: Stork B.V., Hazemeyer, N.V. Heemaf (now part of France&#x27;s Alstom, Brush HMA, Brush-Barclay, Eaton Corporation, Essent, Heemaf BV, Vattenfall, and Wabtec), KHZ (now AkzoNobel), and Hollandse Signaal Apparaten (now part of the Thales Group). Especially Stork played an important role in the development of Hengelo, building garden village Tuindorp &#x27;t Lansink (1910s), with housing for its personnel, while also contributing to building public facilities in the city centre, such as a library. 

Hengelo was also the home town of Hengelo Bier, a local brewery. Nowadays, the beer brand Twents is produced in Hengelo, brewed by De Twentse Bierbrouwerij. This brewery was founded in 2007 and was, until 2019, located in the monumental factory complex Hazemeijer.

During World War II, the city was bombed by the Allies because of the presence of the railways and the war industry activities of local factories that served the occupier. The heart of the town was accidentally destroyed during the bombing of Hengelo on 6 and 7 October 1944, killing several hundreds of people.

In addition, after World War II, the synagogue that had survived the war, an entire block called De Telgen, a monastery at the Thiemsbrug, the farm dating from the 17th century where Wolter ten Cate was born, and the 19th-century town hall, were all demolished. This has also left the city without much of an historical centre. However, the reconstruction plan of Hengelo, including its town hall (1958-1963, J. F. Berghoef), received critical acclaim and is nowadays considered as an important example of post-war city planning in the Netherlands. By extension, Hengelo also became a reference for modern architecture, with innovative housing designs, such as Klein Driene I &amp; II (1945-1965, C. Pouderoyen &amp; W.R. van Couwelaar ), Housing Hengelose Es (1962-1968, Van den Broek &amp; Bakema), and De Kasbah (1969-1973, Piet Blom).

==Transport==
Hengelo is a major transportation hub in the region, which encompasses various modalities.

=== Car ===

* Hengelo sits along the motorway A1 (from Amsterdam to the Dutch-German border), and the E30 (from Cork, Ireland, to Omsk, Russia).
* The A35/N35 motorway from the German border begins as a two-lane expressway leading to the southern side of Enschede, then transitions into a highway that runs along the city&#x27;s western side until Wierden, after that, it reverts to a two-lane expressway and continues as a standard two-lane road towards Zwolle.

=== Train ===

* Hengelo Railway Station is part of the Amsterdam – Berlin train service. There are international trains daily to Bad Bentheim, Rheine, Osnabrück, Hannover, and Berlin.
* From Hengelo there are direct services to cities across the Netherlands, among them Almelo, Amersfoort, Amsterdam, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Amsterdam-Zuid, Apeldoorn, Deventer, Enschede, Gouda, Hilversum, Oldenzaal, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Zutphen, Zwolle. For travel information, visit Hengelo railway station or the website of Dutch Railways.
* Besides the main station, there are two local train stations, Hengelo Oost, giving access to a residential district and leisure facilities, and Hengelo Gezondheidspark, giving access to the city&#x27;s main health care complex (including a hospital).

=== Bus ===
*Within the city, one can travel by train and bus, which are services provided by Arriva. Within the urban transport network are several bus lanes, specifically built for buses to travel faster.

=== Bike ===
*Within and outside the city, there is an extensive network of cyclepaths. Part of it is the so-called Bicyle Highway F35 (&quot;Fietssnelweg F35&quot;), connecting Nijverdal, Wierden, Almelo, Borne, Hengelo and Enschede.

=== Boat ===
*The Twentekanaal (canal) connects the Twente region with the river IJssel. The canal is mainly used for cargo transportation, as Hengelo has a relatively large harbour with various industries.

== Climate ==
Like most of the Netherlands, Hengelo features an oceanic climate (Cfb in the Köppen classification); however, winters tend to be less mild than the rest of the Netherlands due to its inland location. Summer is also warmer than places near the coast. Although the former military airport is derelict and plans to revive the place were canceled in 2012, the weather station of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute is still located there.

==Notable events==
*On February 11, 1992, a Dutch F-16 crashed into the district Hasseler Es.
*The Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip mention Hengelo in their song &quot;At the Hundredth Meridian&quot;, where they &quot;remember Hengelo&quot; after a glorious gig in Metropool (concert hall in Hengelo).
*The British indie rock band Spring Offensive on their first studio album &quot;Young Animal Hearts&quot; mention Hengelo in their song &quot;Hengelo&quot;.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Hengelo is twinned with:
* Emsdetten, Germany

==Education==
Hengelo has seven high schools. These high schools are the Montessori College Twente, Bataafs Lyceum, Twickel College, Avila College, C.T. Stork College, Grundel Lyceum and &#x27;t Genseler.

There is also an MBO school, ROC of Twente.

The Tio Business School (HBO, University of Applied Sciences) is also located in Hengelo.

There is also Twents Vakcollege &#x27;t Woolde which is a worker-oriented school located.

<text>Hof van Twente () is a municipality in the region Twente, in the province Overijssel in the eastern Netherlands. The municipality was established January 1, 2001, as the result of the merger of the municipalities of Diepenheim, Goor, Markelo, Ambt Delden, and Stad Delden.

==History==
Goor (Dutch for: low, swampy land) achieved city rights in 1263. However, it never became an important city. The &quot;Drost&quot; (a kind of mayor) of the Twente region, who ruled this area on behalf of the bishop of Utrecht, had in the late Middle Ages his residence in Goor. In its surroundings some castles were built, among them the house of the important Heeckeren family in 1412. Goor had a small harbour along the river Regge (which flows to the Vecht near Ommen), but when the Twente canal was opened in 1936, a new industrial port was built there. The factory Eternit, that produces building materials containing asbestos, brought Goor unwillingly into trouble. For decades, everyone in Goor was permitted to use production refuse containing asbestos in order to pave their own paths and roads. Not earlier than about 1990, it was known in Goor that especially small particles of this material can cause cancer. In major parts of the city the soil had to be removed and either cleaned or replaced by non-polluted material.

Delden achieved its city rights in 1333. Its circle-shaped centre was surrounded by earthen walls. It came into existence thanks to the Twickel castle, situated less than one mile north of Delden. This castle, that in its present form dates from the 17th century, is still inhabited by a German noble family (Zu Castell - Rüdenhausen).
In 1886, near this castle, salt was discovered under the ground. This led to the exploration of this material, still going on in the nearby city of Hengelo.

In Markelo, prehistoric mounds &quot;tumuli&quot;, containing graves have been excavated.

==Economy==
Hof van Twente is situated in the heart of the province Overijssel: south-west of Almelo, north-east of the Achterhoek region (Prov. Gelderland) and south-east of Rijssen-Holten.
The small cities of Goor and Delden have some important industry (cement, metallics, plastics). Goor has a small harbour along the Twente Canal (Zutphen - Enschede). Permess International is one of the world&#x27;s leading producers of high-quality interlinings offering a complete range of products for the textile and allied industries.
The motorway A35 has a junction between Delden and Hengelo (distance to both towns 2 km).
Agriculture and tourism (see below) are of economic importance as well.

==Sights==

* All through the Hof van Twente (&quot;Garden of Twente&quot;) it is possible to wander around on foot or bicycle. The municipality has many small woods, old water mills, country houses, small castles with their parks, and small lanes through the countryside. Therefore, many tourists visit this rural area. They stay in small hotels, holiday resorts, on camping sites and even at farms.
* The Twickel castle near Delden can only be observed from the outside, but most of its parks and woods (60 square km) are freely accessible.
* Castle Warmelo near Diepenheim, that was built in 1315, and was afterwards devastated and rebuilt several times, is in private use as well. Princess Armgard, the mother of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, who was Queen Juliana&#x27;s husband, lived there until her death in 1971. Its famous gardens are open to the public every summer.
* Castle Weldam, between Markelo and Goor, is inhabited by the German noble family of Zu Solms-Sonnenwalde. The beautiful gardens of this castle can be visited. Castle&#x27;s forest is freely accessible as well.
* In Delden you can visit the Gothic Saint Blasius Church (built in the 15th century).
* Delden has the Dutch Salt Museum (Zoutmuseum), about salt, its history, use and mining.

<text>Kampen () is a city and municipality in the province of Overijssel, Netherlands. A member of the former Hanseatic League, it is located at the lower reaches of the river IJssel.

The municipality of Kampen had a population of in and covers an area of . Kampen is located in the North West of Overijssel and is the largest city in this region. The city of Kampen itself has around 37,000 inhabitants.

Kampen has one of the best preserved old town centres of the Netherlands, including remains of the ancient city wall (of which three gates are still standing) and numerous churches. Also notable are the three bridges over the IJssel which connect Kampen with IJsselmuiden and Kampereiland, the agricultural area between the branches which form the IJssel delta, and a windmill (&quot;d&#x27; Olde Zwarver – &quot;the Old Vagabond). Since November 2018, the town and some communes are on a river island. Between the 14th and 16th century it was one of the biggest towns in the Northern Netherlands (modern day European Netherlands). The town is about 90 kilometer northeast of Amsterdam.

Traditionally people in Kampen speak a variation of the Sallands dialect, known as Kampers.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
By 1150, there were already wooden buildings on the site where Kampen is currently located. The name Kampen, however, is not mentioned until 1277. The city has had city rights since 1236. As a result of its convenient location on the busy trade route between the Zuiderzee and the Rhine, Kampen quickly developed from simple settlements into a prosperous trading town, to become one of the most powerful and leading cities of northwestern Europe. In the 14th century, Kampen exchanged with the bishop of Utrecht, Jan van Arkel, the Mastenbroek polder against the right to increase the IJsseldelta.

The silting up of the IJssel brought a gradual end to the prosperity of Kampen from 1430 on. For a long time Kampen did not want to sign a union and make economic and political concessions to other cities, as was usual in the Hanseatic League. When the County of Holland went to war with the Hanseatic League this situation came to an end: the city was forced to choose a side in the war. Kampen was originally more oriented toward the Baltic trade and commerce with the hinterland of the Rhine, and therefore in 1441 formally joined the Hanseatic League. The city had much influence in the League; despite loud protests from the other towns in lower reaches of the IJssel and from other Hanseatic cities, the League agreed in 1448 to build a bridge over the river. This project was accomplished in just five months. With this bridge Kampen hoped to be able to develop closer relationships with the hinterland.

===Post-Medieval===
On 11 August 1572 Kampen was conquered from the Spaniards by Willem van den Bergh, a brother of William of Orange. After the massacre of Zutphen on 15 November, the city voluntarily surrendered to the Spanish. In 1578, the city changed ownership again after the Siege of Kampen, led by George van Lalaing. Due to its right to increase the IJsseldelta, Kampen was owner of the growing Kampereiland. From 1500 the islands were leased. The rents were so large that the city did not need to raise taxes.

In October 1670, Kampen was the first of four Dutch cities to raise capital by issuing a Tontine. 

The Franco-Dutch War, fought by the Republic of the United Netherlands against the Kingdom of France, Sweden, the Bishopric of Münster, the Archbishopric of Cologne and the Kingdom of England, marked a definitive end to the enormous power of the city.

Kampen only became well known again in the 19th century. The city was difficult to reach from the sea, because the surrounding wetlands became silted up and shallow. During the preceding centuries, the watercourse of the river IJssel was dredged several times, but the costs were relatively high and within a few years, the river silted up again. As the IJssel had several delta-like mouths here, the main route of the river shifted several times. In the 19th century, a new strategy was put in place to counter this problem: some watercourses were dammed to allow for more water at a higher speed through one or two main routes. This had the advantage that less sand and silt were deposited and resulted in a river course that &quot;swept itself clean&quot;. A key figure in this story is city architect , who, besides his work for the current IJssel front of the city of Kampen, was also involved in hydraulic engineering. Due to the emerging industry in the 19th century and the importance of roads and railways for the economy, highways and paved roads were constructed to replace transportation over sand and mud roads.

== Geography ==
Kampen is part of the province of Overijssel (&#x27;Over-IJssel&#x27; i.e. (mostly) trans-/across the river IJssel, as seen from the perspective of the bishopric of Utrecht by which it was held until 1528) in the Eastern part of The Netherlands, situated between the provinces of Gelderland, Flevoland, Drenthe and Friesland.

The city of Kampen is situated at the mouth of the river IJssel. Opposite Kampen, along the IJssel, lies IJsselmuiden, which is the second largest residential nucleus of the municipality Kampen.

The municipality of Kampen has five other population centers: Grafhorst, &#x27;s-Heerenbroek, Kamperveen, Wilsum and Zalk.

== Culture ==

=== Historical buildings and other landmarks ===
Kampen has a large number of old to very old buildings, including remains of the ancient city wall (whose city gates are still standing) and the Church of St Nicholas (Bovenkerk). The structure of the walled fortress city is still visible in the streets.

Significant structures include:
* The &quot;Koornmarktpoort&quot;: a city gate located near the river IJssel which probably dates from the 14th century. In the 15th century two squat towers were added at the outer corners.
* The &quot;Broederpoort&quot;: a rectangular city gate with four slender towers, originally from 1465, rebuilt in Renaissance style in 1615
* The &quot;Cellebroederspoort&quot;: a rectangular city gate, flanked by two heavy round towers, originally from 1465, rebuilt in 1617 in Renaissance style
* The Stedelijk Museum Kampen: located in the former town hall of Kampen, which dates from the late 14th century
* The &quot;Gotisch huis&quot;: built around 1500. This was the location of the Stedelijk Museum Kampen before it moved to its current location in the old town hall.
* The &quot;Nieuwe Toren&quot;: a tower with a carillon designed by Philips Vingboons and dating from 1648 to 1664
* The Church of St. Nicholas (&quot;Bovenkerk&quot;): a great Gothic basilica dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. The interior of the church houses an early-Renaissance choir screen (1552), a stone pulpit (circa 1500) and a monumental organ from 1670 to 1676.
* The &quot;Broederkerk&quot;: a 14th-century church which originally belonged to a Franciscan monastery
* The &quot;Buitenkerk&quot;: a 14th-century church
* The &quot;Burgwalkerk&quot;: a neoclassical 19th-century church
* A windmill called &quot;d&#x27;Olde Zwarver&quot;, built in 1842
* A monastery gate dating from 1665 called &quot;Linnenweverspoortje&quot;
* The city auditorium (&quot;Stadsgehoorzaal&quot;), dating from 1891
* An old tobacco factory, &quot;De Olifant&quot;, where cigars are still made with 19th-century equipment. &quot;De Olifant&quot; cigars are sold in the shop and guided tours are available.

Throughout the town of Kampen, there are colorful murals which are in fact old commercials for now-defunct business in Kampen. These murals, which include Art Nouveau influences, were made by local artists and are now referred to as &quot;frescoes of the middle class&quot;. As a result of current municipal policy, wherever these murals are discovered under old plaster, they are restored to their former glory.

A number of better or lesser known people with a certain connection with Kampen is honoured with a commemorative stone bearing their name and a single-sentence characterization of their personality or achievements, incorporated into the pavement of the &quot;Oude Raadhuisplein&quot; (formerly &quot;Koeplein&quot;), the square in between the old town hall, the former Post Office and &quot;Nieuwe Toren&quot;.

=== Gallery ===
=== Festivals and events ===
An annual festival during the summer months is the &quot;&quot; day. The name is derived from a series of folk tales in which the inhabitants of Kampen were portrayed as stupid. Another summer event is the Full Color Festival, which is organized annually. Every third Saturday of August, a comics event, called the &quot;Kamper Stripspektakel&quot;, is organized with over 100 booths.

Once every three years &quot;Sail Kampen&quot; takes place, a sailing spectacle with (old) sailing ships.

A weekend before Christmas &quot;Christmas in Oud Kampen&quot; is organized. There is street theater, where pieces of famous musicals are played, and mid-nineteenth-century characters are walking around the city.

===Sports===
Kampen is the home of football team Go Ahead Kampen and its rivals Dos Kampen, KHC Kampen, VV Kampen and IJVV.

===Humor===

The foolish wisdom of the residents of the Dutch city of Kampen gave rise to the term (Kamper ui, plural: Kamper uien) for town-of-fools type stories, as well for the &quot;Kampersteur&quot; (&quot;Kamper Sturgeon&quot;) dish, which is made not of sturgeon, but of eggs: to greet a visiting bishop the Kampers caught a large sturgeon, and to keep it fresh they tied a cowbell to it and let it back in water. When the bishop arrived, the fish was gone, and a dish made of eggs was served instead. The &quot;onion&quot; in &quot;Kamper onion&quot; comes from the tale, variants of which are known in various cultures: a tramp convinces a farmer and his wife that he knows how to cook a nutritious stew from onion and salt. But while cooking he adds plenty of other stuff &quot;to improve the taste&quot;.

==Twin towns==
Kampen is twinned with:
== Transportation ==

The Kampen railway station opened in 1865 as terminus of the Kamperlijntje branch from Overijssel&#x27;s capital city Zwolle. It is served by a non-stop diesel service on a single track. The line was renovated in 2017 to be electrified. In December 2017, Keolis Nederland took over the line, after Nederlandse Spoorwegen lost the line in a tendering process. There is an alternative railway connection with Zwolle via the Hanzelijn, which links Zwolle with Amsterdam via Dronten, Lelystad and Almere. It was inaugurated by Queen Beatrix in December 2012. Kampen Zuid railway station was built a few kilometers south of Kampen near the junction of the national roads N50 and N764, where a new residential development is planned. Somewhat confusingly, there was a Kampen Zuid railway station in existence before, between 1 October 1913 and 15 May 1934. This was the terminus of the Kampen–Hattem railway line, which connected with the Zwolle–Apeldoorn service via Wapenveld and Heerde. Surface roads connecting the city include N760, N763, N765 and N307.

== Education ==
Kampen had two theological universities: the Theological University of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PThU) and the theological college of the Reformed Church of the Netherlands (TUK).

<text>Losser () is a municipality and a town in the eastern Netherlands. It is at the eastern end of the A1 motorway.

==Population centres==

==Losser==
The oldest known reference to Losser dates from the tenth century. Originally, the village consisted of two separate parts. Both were almost completely destroyed when on 21 September 1665, troops from Münster set fire to them.

One of the town&#x27;s oldest buildings is the Martinustoren (St. Martin&#x27;s Tower), dating from around 1500 and the only remaining part of a church demolished in 1903.

==Geography==
A few kilometers west of De Lutte, close to the border with Oldenzaal, lies the Tankenberg, a hill the top of which (85 m) is the highest point in the province. (For myths of the Tankenberg, see Tanfana.)

The municipality&#x27;s most important body of water is the river Dinkel.

<text>Olst-Wijhe () is a municipality in the province of Overijssel, eastern Netherlands. It borders the Overijssel municipalities of Zwolle to the north, Raalte to the north and east and Deventer to the south; and the Gelderland municipalities of Voorst, Epe and Heerde to the west.

==History and economic activities==
Both of the municipality&#x27;s main towns, Olst and Wijhe, are old towns. Olst, which is believed to have been founded in the 7th century, is first mentioned in chronicles in 947 (as &quot;Holsto&quot;), Wijhe in 960 (as &quot;Wie&quot;). Traditionally, agriculture (fruit and cereals), cattle, meat processing and the production of bricks in open-air brickworks along river IJssel were the prime sources of income in the area.

Nowadays, Olst and Wijhe are mainly commuter residences for people working in Deventer and Zwolle respectively; both towns have had a railroad station on the Zwolle–Nijmegen main line (route 3600) since 1866. The surrounding land still relies heavily on agriculture. There is some small industry in Olst (machinery manufacturing) and Wijhe (meat processing).

===Merger of municipalities===
The present municipality was created on 1 January 2001 through the merger of the two former municipalities of Olst and Wijhe as part of a nationwide bid to reduce administrative overhead on the municipal level. The newly merged municipality retained the name of its largest constituent part, Olst, pending approval of a definitive new name. After proposed neutral names containing neither &quot;Olst&quot; nor &quot;Wijhe&quot; met with little enthusiasm, it was decided to simply name the municipality Olst-Wijhe as of 26 March 2002.

A new town hall is being built on the southern outskirts of Wijhe.

==Geographical features==

Olst-Wijhe is dominated by river IJssel, which partly flows through it and partly forms the border between the provinces Overijssel and Gelderland. Although this border largely runs along river IJssel, there are two left-bank exclaves opposite the towns of Olst and Wijhe, in which the villages of Welsum and Welsumerveld (south exclave) and Marle (north exclave) are situated. There are cable ferries between Olst and Welsum and between Wijhe and Vorchten in the municipality of Heerde (there is no direct connection between Marle and the rest of Overijssel).

Olst-Wijhe is part of the low-lying Salland region. The one metre above mean sea level contour line runs roughly parallel to the river; the municipality&#x27;s interior is characterised by flat or gently rolling grasslands and woodlands at about 10–15 metres above mean sea level.

Apart from river IJssel, several more streams flow through the municipality&#x27;s territory. They are called &quot;wetering&quot; (&quot;drainage waterway&quot;) and are amalgamations of natural streams gradually channelised from the 18th century onwards and specifically dug canals
. From west to east, these are Zandwetering, Soestwetering, Groote Vloedgraven, Oude Wetering and Nieuwe Wetering. All these streams flow in a south–north direction and come together at one point or other to eventually form the Zwarte Water river near the city of Zwolle. On the left side of river IJssel, near the exclave of Welsum, there are several more &quot;wetering&quot; streams, all but one of them on the Gelderland side of the border; the exception being the easternmost of these, the Terwoldsche Wetering, which forms the border between Olst-Wijhe and Voorst.

==Population centres==

The municipality consists of the following statistical areas (2010 population figures with difference from 2009 figures):
* Boerhaar (765, +33)
* Boskamp (1,265, +174, includes Hengforden)
* Den Nul (890, +322, includes Fortmond and Duur)
* Eikelhof (340, +45)
* Elshof (765, +292)
* Herxen (415, +95)
* Marle (75, −1)
* Middel (350, +137)
* Olst (5,225, +111)
* Welsum (605, +/-0, includes Welsumerveld)
* Wesepe (1,155, −51)
* Wijhe (5,690, −414)

==Transportation==
* Railway stations: Olst, Wijhe

==Attractions==


===Mansions and windmills===
There are numerous mansions and country houses strewn around the municipality, most of them built in the 18th century. These include Groot Hoenlo, Klein Hoenlo, Nijendal, De Haere, Wijnbergen, De Hei and Nijenhuis. The mansions themselves are generally still inhabited or used for commercial purposes and so cannot be visited, but their grounds are open to visitors to stroll around.

The mansion of Nijenhuis (near the border with Raalte) has been converted into an art gallery (a.o. Permeke, Van Gogh) with sculpture garden (a.o. Zadkine). There are windmills at Welsum, Olst (two), Boskamp, Wesepe, Marle and Wijhe (two). Of these, the ones at Welsum, Olst (one), Marle and Wijhe (one) are still fully functional.

===Eikelhof===
* The murder cross, erected in medieval times to commemorate/atone for a highway murder and source of many apocryphal mythical stories. It bears the legend:

STIERF HIER JOHAN LUCKENS&lt;br&gt;
BID VOER DE SELE&lt;br&gt;
* A small museum of regional geology halfway between Eikelhof and Boskamp

<text>Ommen () is a municipality and a Hanseatic city in the eastern Netherlands. It is located in the Vecht valley of the Salland region in Overijssel. Historical records first name Ommen in the early 12th century and it was officially founded as a city in 1248. The municipality had a population of in and covers an area of .

==Population centres==
Besides the city of Ommen (population: 8,710) and the town of Lemele (population: 570), the municipality consists of the following hamlets and villages:

==History==
===The emergence of Ommen===
The first inhabitants of the area around Ommen were probably semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers. Flint from the Mesolithic period found in between Ommen and Mariënberg indicates the presence of humans around 9,000 BCE, but there seems to have been hardly any cultivation or permanent settlement during this period.

The Vecht (sometimes called the Overijsselse Vecht, to avoid confusion with its namesake in Utrecht) and Regge rivers determined the first settlements in the area that is now the municipality of Ommen. Most of the Salland region was marshy but the higher banks along the Vecht and Regge provided fertile soil for agriculture. Moreover, good roads were rare, so for trade, transport and travel the rivers provided a vital infrastructure. The first sporadic agricultural settlements in Salland therefore arose along the riverbanks of the Vecht and the Regge around 5,000 BCE. Indeed, all early population centres in the current municipality of Ommen were originally built on riverbanks — with the exception of the town of Lemele, which was situated on the lower slopes of the Lemelerberg, free from flooding by the Regge.
The location of Ommen itself proved particularly suitable for settlement — not only because of the fertile river soil and the higher ground of the river dune (even today the church square is visibly higher than the streets to its east and south), but also because of the ford in the Vecht facilitating trade routes between the Frisian north and Twente to the south. Archeological discoveries indicate that the first settlement in Ommen itself emerged during the 8th century CE, and by the end of the 11th century a veritable town had developed — among the first in Overijssel. The first permanent settlers in Ommen were mixed crop-livestock farmers who also engaged in river trade and innkeeping. Most of these first settlers were probably of Saxon origin, though the Salians who dominated the banks of the IJssel also influenced the region economically, politically and religiously. The first houses in Ommen were &quot;hutkommen&quot;: wooden houses of which the ground floor was typically around half a meter below the ground. A church was built at the heart of Ommen around 1150 and was soon after replaced by a stone church, indicating further growth of the settlement. Written records first mention Ommen as &quot;de Vmme&quot; in 1133 and as &quot;Ummen&quot; in 1227.

This gradual growth, however, did not mean Ommen could also dominate the surrounding area politically, as there were many other powers in the land. Above all, the Prince-Bishop of Utrecht, who had obtained dominion over all of Oversticht from Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1010, repeatedly attempted to increase and centralise his authority over the towns and estates of Salland. The burghers of nearby cities — especially Zwolle — were also known to interfere in the region. More locally, farming communities in the eastern Netherlands organised themselves into &quot;markes&quot; (autonomous areas) where a &quot;buurschap&quot; (rule by neighbours) formed a unique kind of grassroots local government. Last but not least, &quot;havezates&quot; (or castles) arose in the area surrounding Ommen — especially at strategic points such as the banks of the Vecht (the Arendshorst on the northern bank and Beerze on the southern bank), the banks of the Regge (most notably at Eerde) or both banks (&#x27;t Laer) — from which robber barons dominated the surrounding area and could levy tolls on river commerce in defiance of the authority of the bishop. These robber barons and the &quot;buurschappen&quot; formed a check on the influence of Ommen on the surrounding region — yet it was ironically due to one such robber baron that Ommen grew to become an outright city.

===Development into a city===
On 25 August 1248, Ommen received city rights and fortification rights from Otto III, the Prince-Bishop of Utrecht, after the town was pillaged by local robber baron Rudolf of Coevorden and his militia of freemen in both 1215 and in the aftermath of the Battle of Ane of 1227. Ommen&#x27;s location at the confluence of two rivers at the heart of the region made it the bishop&#x27;s strategic and logistic basis in the defence of his domain Oversticht against the rebellious Drents. Ommen thus became the 4th-oldest officially recognised city in Overijssel, after Deventer (956 A.D.), Zwolle and Rijssen.

A wall was soon erected around Ommen, including three gates: the &quot;Vechtpoort&quot; or &quot;Voorbruggenpoort&quot; (on the bank of the Vecht), the &quot;Varsenerpoort&quot; (on the western wall for traffic with Varsen) and the &quot;Arriërpoort&quot; (on the northern wall for traffic with Arriën). Even to this day, the two bells in the church&#x27;s belltower, named &quot;Maria&quot; and &quot;Salvator&quot; and cast in 1517 by Hendrick de Tremonia of Dordrecht, are rung every evening at nine o&#x27;clock. These so-called &quot;Ave-Maria peals&quot; form a custom which traces its origin to the tradition of ringing the bell at the closing of the gates. Ommen never received a moat, even though it was permitted one.

Ommen soon became a regional port and market for agricultural products. Due to this commercial growth and strategic commercial position, Ommen eventually joined the Hanseatic League as a smaller port, so most of its trade was not directly with the Baltic Sea region, but with fellow Hanseatic cities Zwolle, Kampen, Zutphen and especially Deventer, of which it was a subsidiary city. A toll bridge across the Vecht (first built in 1492) further increased its wealth and commercial importance, even though the toll bridge across the Vecht was destroyed by ice floes three times through the centuries. The toll levy was usually auctioned off to private tax collectors, who resided in the toll house (built in 1531) next to the bridge. A bridge toll would be levied until 1925.

For centuries during the Middle Ages, the &quot;Estates of Oversticht&quot;, a diet or feudal parliament representing the quarters of Salland, Twenthe and Vollenhove (and until 1527 also Drenthe) and the cities of Zwolle, Deventer and Kampen, convened just outside the city of Ommen at Nieuwebrug (or New Bridge), named after the bridge over the Regge on the road between Ommen and Hellendoorn. Following a feud between Kampen and Zwolle in 1519, however, a gathering of the Estates was attacked by citizens of neighbouring Zwolle, who abducted three noblemen and pillaged nearby Eerde castle. During the years that followed, conflict escalated in Overijssel.

===War and disaster===

In 1522, citizens of Zwolle attacked and pillaged Ommen with the aid of Duke Charles of Guelders who thus conquered the city from Utrecht. Only the church and women&#x27;s home &quot;de Heilige Geest&quot; (the Holy Spirit) survived the pillage and fire.

Ommen remained part of Guelders until 1528, when emperor Charles V inherited authority over the entire Duchy of Guelders, including Overijssel. A new city hall was built in 1531 in between the church and the Vrijthof square. The city was pillaged again in 1568 by Spanish troops under the &#x27;Iron&#x27; Duke of Alba, fighting for Charles&#x27;s successor, Philip II of Spain. This time, the pillage was not as devastating: Ommen&#x27;s church, city hall and several other main buildings were spared. In 1581, the Estates of Overijssel convened outside Ommen to depose Philip and proclaim the independence of the Netherlands.
Though a &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; for the young Dutch Republic, the 17th century proved rather devastating for Ommen. A great fire in 1624 inflicted serious damage on the church, of which only the foundations and a few walls remained. To control traffic and to prevent military invasions from the north, the fortification of Ommerschans was constructed. In 1672, one of the most severe fires in Ommen&#x27;s history raged through the entire city, destroying everything but the church. In that same year, the aptly named &#x27;Rampjaar&#x27; (disaster year), the Franco-Dutch War broke out, and until 1674 foreign troops (especially from Münster) frequently marched through Ommen, demanding passage, payment, food and lodging. It was not until 1753 that Ommen had sufficiently recovered to afford a new city hall, built at the Vrijthof square, on the same location as the previous building.

During the so-called &#x27;periwig era&#x27; of decline in the Netherlands, discontent with oligarchical rule also increased in Ommen. In 1732, the citizens of Ommen rose up against the city council. A petition was handed to the Magistrate on May 31, in which a large share of the citizenry rejected its authority and asked it to resign. The council refused and severe riots ensued, but eventually order was restored. In 1762, a night guard was installed to maintain public order, but the unrest would remain until the Batavian Revolution of 1795.

===Ommen in modern times===
On March 2, 1809, the municipal authorities prepared a welcome for the visit of Lodewijk Napoleon, king of the short-lived Kingdom of Holland. They were disappointed when they found out the king had already passed Ommen the day before. The three burgomasters quickly pursued the king and met with his party near Gramsbergen, still receiving a gift of 1000 Dutch guilders for the well-intended preparations for his visit.

When his brother Napoleon Bonaparte annexed the Kingdom of Holland into the French Empire in 1810, he had all local government radically reformed to become compatible with French structures. Ommen too was affected: the separate jurisdictions of Stad Ommen (composed of the city of Ommen and the Ommerschans) and Ambt Ommen (which comprised most of the rest of the current municipality, Avereest and Den Ham as well) were merged into one &quot;Mairie Ommen&quot; (though Den Ham became a separate municipality). This caused much controversy and discontent locally because the &quot;marke&quot; communities thus lost their ancient rights of self-governance. In 1818, shortly after Dutch independence, Mairie Ommen was once more decentralised into the municipalities Stad Ommen, Ambt Ommen and Avereest. To ensure good coordination, one burgomaster was appointed over both Stad and Ambt from 1851 onwards.

To safeguard the eastern borders of the newly established Kingdom of the Netherlands, plans were drawn by order of Baron Krayenhoff in 1819 to convert Ommen into a city with fortifications. However, these radical plans (&quot;Ontwerp ter bevestiging van Ommen 1819&quot;) were not carried out in the end, as the IJssel river to the west was considered a more natural line of defence.

Although renovated and expanded in 1758, the toll house next to the bridge (also called the bridge master&#x27;s house) was torn down in 1827 to be replaced by a new city hall, designed by the architect J.P. Orentzburg. This new building, situated on the bank of the Vecht, housed all offices of the municipal authorities — including the city council, the court, the tax and toll office, the Gentlemen&#x27;s Society and the home of the burgomaster. The court moved to a new building in 1882. The burgomaster and the Gentlemen&#x27;s Society moved soon afterwards. The city hall was renovated and expanded in 1925 and again in 1955. The municipal authorities left the building in 1982. It has since been converted into a museum and a restaurant.

In 1923, the municipalities of Stad Ommen and Ambt Ommen were once again merged. The borders of the municipality have remained unchanged since, with the exception of the eastern part of Lemelerveld which came under the municipality of Dalfsen in 1997.

On the night of 6 February 1972, a Palestine terrorist organisation named Black September attempted to blow up a natural gas pipeline at a distribution hub near Ommen, but not all explosives were detonated. A blue bag filled with explosives was found after the explosion, next to a crater. During the same night there were also attacks in Hamburg and the Dutch village of Ravenstein — and later that year, Black September also caused the Munich Massacre.

===Eerde===
About four kilometres () south-east of Ommen and adjacent to the hamlet of Eerde lies the castle Eerde, a castle in the Dutch-classical style from 1715, surrounded by a 1,667 hectare estate in the Baroque style managed by the Natuurmonumenten foundation since 1965.

The name &quot;Eerde&quot; is a Saxon word meaning &quot;earth&quot;. The first castle on this site was built in the 14th century, but was soon destroyed by the bishop&#x27;s men in 1380 — along with the fortifications of the town of Ommen. In the centuries since, the Van Twickelo, Van Renesse and Van Pallandt families have lived in castles on this site. The castle was used by the famous philosopher and spiritual teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti, of whom Baron Philip van Pallandt was an avid follower, from about 1924 to just before the start of the Second World War. Van Pallandt granted Krishnamurti a territory at the Besthemerberg, north of Eerde. There Krishnamurti held his Order of the Star in the East lectures and meetings in front of audiences of thousands of people from dozens of countries.

During the Second World War, a Nazi concentration camp, &quot;Kamp Erika&quot;, was situated at the Besthemerberg. Only eight Jews were detained here; the camp was designated mostly for Dutchmen convicted of black market trade or resistance to the occupational authorities. The camp was notorious for the brutal behaviour of its personnel, leading Dutch judges to refuse to send convicts there in 1943. The camp was turned into an &quot;Arbeitserziehungslager&quot; mostly for those refusing to do forced labour, but in the fall of 1944 it once again became a penal camp. The camp was liberated on 11 April 1945. From 1945 to 1946, the camp was instead used to detain Dutchmen who had collaborated with the German occupiers. Their treatment was not much better.

Nowadays the castle houses the private international boarding school Eerde, which offers the IB programme.

===Ommerschans===
About ten kilometres () due north of Ommen lies the former Ommerschans fortification. The Ommerschans was a fortress built in 1628 as part of a defence line to defend the northern provinces of Groningen and Friesland from the marauding count Hendrik van den Bergh (in Spanish service) after the expiration of the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce. Hendrik, a nephew of William of Orange, then defected to the Dutch Republic in 1633.

The defences of the Ommerschans were restrengthened in the middle of the 17th century to deter and halt a possible invasion from the German states. Despite these new fortifications, the Ommerschans was captured without any resistance when Prince-Bishop Bernhard von Galen of Münster and Archbishop-Elector Maximilian Henry of Cologne invaded in 1672, the so-called rampjaar (or disaster year) that started the Franco-Dutch War. The 146 musketeers and 55 pikemen stationed at the Ommerschans fled north, only to return later that year when the bishops retreated after their failed siege of the northern city of Groningen.

Under pressure from the citizens of Ommen and after the Peace of Utrecht of 1713, the fortress was closed down in 1715, only to be reinstated as a fortified arsenal in 1740 when war reignited in Continental Europe. During the Patriot Revolt of 1787, militias from Zwolle, Kampen and Vollenhove conquered and pillaged the Ommerschans, stealing all its weaponry to help them in their paramilitary struggle against the regime. The Ommerschans fortification became abandoned and would never again be used for military purposes.
In the early 19th century, the Dutch government changed it into a resocialisation institution and labour camp for beggars, prostitutes and alcoholics from Amsterdam and other western cities. They were supposed to learn farming and morals by experience so they could reintegrate into society. In reality the beggars were used for semi-forced and all-but-unpaid labour to reclaim the wetlands surrounding Ommerschans, eventually reclaiming an area of 4 by kilometres. Politician and novelist Jacob van Lennep visited Ommerschans during his walking tour with Dirk van Hogendorp across the newly independent United Kingdom of the Netherlands in the summer of 1823, and documented his shock at the conditions at the labour camp: &quot;These hours are certainly among the saddest I have lived through.&quot;

When the institution went bankrupt in 1859 the Dutch government managed the labour camp until 1889, when it was finally closed down. During its years in operation, between several hundred and two thousand workers would live at Ommerschans at any one time, and an estimated 5448 workers died whilst interned there.

==The city of Ommen==

===Location, economy and infrastructure===
Ommen lies east of the provincial capital of Zwolle and north-east of fellow Hanseatic city Deventer. It lies on the north bank of the Vecht river, not far from where the Regge river merges with this stream. Only smaller ships and yachts can use these waterways.

Because Ommen is a rural municipality, tourism and agriculture are the pillars of the local economy. The forests and hilly heathlands of Ommen attract many nature-seeking visitors. The city of Ommen has several hotels and in the surrounding area there are fifteen campgrounds. Gilwell Ada&#x27;s Hoeve on the left bank of the Vecht was the first Scouting campground in the Netherlands. Ommen also has a small marina.

Since 15 January 1903, Ommen has had a railway station designed by Eduard Cuypers. It is situated one kilometre () from the centre on the opposite side of the Vecht. The station is on the (minor) Zwolle-Emmen line and trains stop roughly twice an hour. Ommen also used to have direct railway links to Stadskanaal and to Deventer via Raalte, which were abandoned when they lost their importance due to the emergence of the automobile. Early plans to establish railway lines from Ommen to Hoogeveen and to Hellendoorn were abandoned for that same reason.

An important infrastructural problem is the N34 road from Zwolle via Emmen to Groningen, which crosses the city of Ommen. One of its main crossroads, near the Vecht bridge is a bottleneck that causes frequent traffic congestion. The government is rerouting the N34 road north of the city, in order to reduce crosstown traffic.

===Local politics===
The current mayor of Ommen is Hans Vroomen. He started his tenure on December 18, 2017

The last municipal elections were in March 2022. The seventeen seats in Ommen&#x27;s municipal council are divided as follows:

==International relations==
===Twin towns — Sister cities===
Ommen is twinned with:
==Culture==

===Bissing===

Ommen is famous for its &quot;Bissing&quot; fair and markets. These yearly markets have been organised on the second Tuesday of July since at least 1557. The Bissing lasted three days from Monday till Wednesday. Its success was based on the wide array of products on offer and a relaxation of excises and regulation on alcoholic consumption, attracting merchants and consumers to Ommen from far and wide. In the 19th century it became one of the main markets in the province of Overijssel, and there would often be brawls and riots. In 1918, the council of Dutch Reformed Church asked the town council to end the public events surrounding the Bissing for moral reasons. The town council complied and the Bissing activities were suspended until 1958, although the market continued.

Nowadays the Bissing has become a major tourist attraction, lasting for five consecutive Wednesdays after the initial market and comprising a wide array of ceremonies, fairs, concerts, funfairs and activities.

The etymology of the word &quot;Bissing&quot; is widely discussed. Some believe it is derived from &#x27;Bishop&#x27;s day&#x27;, in recognition of the granting of Ommen&#x27;s town rights, whilst others believe the Low-Saxon word is related to the English word &quot;business&quot;.

===Language===
Most inhabitants of Ommen speak Dutch, but many will also speak Low Saxon or &quot;Plat&quot; — an ancient language related to Low German and Old English which is indigenous to the north-east of the Netherlands. The dialect of Plat spoken in Ommen is Sallands. Although both the national government and the European Union recognise Plat as a regional language, it is considered by many to be a mere dialect of Dutch, and its popularity is waning rapidly, even compared to Twents.

The poet Johanna van Buren died in Ommen in 1962. Her Plat poetry in the Salland and Twents dialect is still popular throughout Overijssel. The Johanna van Buren Cultural Prize is awarded once every three years to a person who contributed to the regional culture of the Eastern Netherlands.

===Religion===
Ommen has a reasonable mix of Christian churches, with sizable Roman Catholic, Dutch Protestant and Liberated Reformed (&quot;Gereformeerd Vrijgemaakt&quot;) congregations.

Ommen was built around the old church at its centre, built around 1150, first mentioned in 1238 and severely damaged by fires in 1330 and 1624. The church was converted to Calvinism during the Reformation of the 16th century, and it was not until the constitutional reforms of 1853 that the Roman Catholicism was once again openly practiced in Ommen and not until 1860 that a new Roman Catholic church was founded in the centre of Ommen. The village of Vilsteren to the west of Ommen, however, had remained entirely Roman Catholic throughout the centuries.

The famous preacher and dissenter Albertus van Raalte lived and worked in Ommen between 1839 and 1844, before he and his congregation moved to America to found the Christian Reformed Church in North America and the city of Holland, Michigan.

Jews in the Ommen area often were small-scale butchers. Most of Ommen&#x27;s Jewish community was murdered during the Holocaust or left soon after the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The synagogue building was demolished in 1956. Jewish graveyards still exist.

Stöppelhaene is a Harvest Festival that has been celebrated in the last weekend (Wednesday through Sunday) of August since 1951. The highlight is the Harvest Parade on Thursday. Ribs &amp; Blues is a music festival including blues music that has been held on the Whitsun weekend since &#x27;97.
* Luttenberg is known for its motorcycle races every summer. 
* Luttenberg is also known for its Lourdes Cave, an artificial cave with a statue of the Virgin Mary of Lourdes, situated at the centre of the village opposing the parish church.
* South-west of Heino, just across the railroad and the border to the municipality Olst-Wijhe, stands the castle Nijenhuis. It hosts an important art museum ( Constant Permeke, Van Gogh et al.). Around the castle is a sculpture garden (Ossip Zadkine et al.). 
* Near Luttenberg there is a small hill (Luttenberg) covered with heath and forest, where nice walks can be made.
* The Roman Catholic basilica &quot;Kruisverheffing&quot; (Exaltation of the Holy Cross) in Raalte. This Neo-Gothic church, designed by Alfred Tepe, was built in 1892. During &quot;Stöppelhaene&quot; there is an exposition of mosaics made out of seeds, representing religious themes. The festival starts and ends with special Holy Masses in this church. 
* The small &quot;Plaskerk&quot;, the oldest building in the centre of Raalte, is a Protestant church. A typical example of Dutch religious tolerance was the fact, that the Protestants were allowed to hold their Sunday services in the big Roman Catholic church, as the Plaskerk was restored in 2006.
* Once a year there is a blues festival called &quot;Ribs &amp; Blues&quot;. The festival is held close to Ascension Day. Some bands and artists that have played during this festival over the last few years include: The Beach Boys, Status Quo, and Candy Dulfer.

<doc id="118468" wikidata="Q10021" url="?curid=118468" title="Staphorst">
<text>Staphorst () is a municipality and a town in the eastern Netherlands.

==History==

The villages of Staphorst and its southern neighbour Rouveen came into existence as in the 13th century monks started to bring the bogs and swamps into culture.

All the farms were built along the long road through the bog area. Thus a lengthy row of farms was built, becoming the long village of Staphorst-Rouveen. This phenomenon is called in Dutch: &quot;lintbebouwing&quot; (ribbon urbanization). In many parts of the Netherlands this type of village is quite common, e.g. Vriezenveen, the villages along river dykes in the Netherlands, the so-called moor-colonies in the provinces Drenthe and Groningen, as well as the German regions opposite the border.

Staphorst was a Dutch municipality, created through a decree by French emperor Napoleon who merged four smaller entities into a much larger one. The 1811 decree merged the villages of Rouveen, Staphorst and IJhorst along with nearby sparsely populated Hasselter schoutambt (a judicial entity) into a municipality, known since 1818 as Staphorst. Except for a few minor changes, Staphorst&#x27;s borders have remained unchanged, making it an anomaly in Dutch municipal history.

A specialty for Staphorst is, that after a farmer&#x27;s death, his land was often divided between his sons. The son who did not inherit his father&#x27;s farm built a farm-house for his own behind the other. Therefore, many pieces of farmland are very lengthy, yet narrow (e.g. 1500 x 40 metres). Originally, each piece of land was 125 metres wide.

The farms are of the traditional Low Saxon type. They have green doors and window shutters. Most farms existing now were built between 1850 and 1910.

==Society==
Staphorst is still a largely orthodox Calvinist village and has one of the highest church attendancy rates of the Netherlands. In 1971, Staphorst became world news due to an outbreak of polio. 39 people (mostly children) became infected with polio. Of these, five died and a number of others became disabled. 20% of residents remain unvaccinated for religious reasons. As a result, Staphorst and other similar areas in the Netherlands are classified as risk areas by the WHO – the only such area in Europe.

The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in Staphorst at 2.76 was 4th highest in all of Netherlands in 2003. That makes Staphorst a place with one of the highest birth rates in all of Europe.

==Population centres==
==Demographics ==
Staphorst had a sustainable birth rate until the beginning of 21st century. But during the 2000–2007 period, the birth rate dropped considerably. 
*Birth Rate: 15.79 per 1000 (down from 18.96 in 2000).
*Death Rate: 6.98 per 1000.
*NGR: +0.88%

The birth rate of Staphorst declined further to 14,9‰ in 2016, while the total fertility rate declined to 2,65 children per woman.

== Notable people ==

* Lambertus Johannes Hansen (1803 in Staphorst – 1859) Dutch painter
* Tjerk Vermaning (1929 in Staphorst – 1986) a controversial Dutch amateur archaeologist
* Roelof Bisschop (born 1956 in Staphorst) a Dutch historian and politician

=== Sport ===
* Marc Houtzager (born 1971 in Rouveen) a Dutch show jumping equestrian, silver medallist at the 2012 Summer Olympics
* Bert Konterman (born 1971 in Rouveen) former professional footballer with 470 appearances for clubs in the Netherlands and Scotland.

<doc id="118469" wikidata="Q10022" url="?curid=118469" title="Steenwijkerland">
<text>Steenwijkerland (; or ) is a municipality in the province of Overijssel, in the eastern Netherlands. Prior to a name change in 2003, it was known as Steenwijk.

The municipality forms the entire northwesterly corner of the province. This area is called &quot;the Head of Overijssel&quot; (in Dutch: &quot;de Kop van Overijssel&quot;). It borders the province Friesland. 
The seat of the municipality, Steenwijk, with a population of about 17,100, is situated on the A32 motorway (Zwolle – Meppel – Leeuwarden) and has a railway station on the line connecting those same cities.

==Economy==
Steenwijk is the economic and administrative centre of the region. Many smaller trading and industrial enterprises are housed here, as well as a hospital and some secondary schools.

Vollenhove has a shipyard, where very exclusive yachts are built.

All over the area, partially being below sea level, the soil is somewhat swampy. Many Steenwijkerland farmers only raise cattle. The soil is too wet to grow corn or wheat. However, the wetlands also have an advantage: many nature- or water sports-loving tourists come to the municipality.

==Population centres==
The larger places are printed in bold type.
==Sights==
* The city of Steenwijk can be visited for daily shopping, going to the market, etc.
* In Steenwijk the villa &quot;Ramswoerthe&quot;, built in 1899 in Jugendstil architecture, and its park can be visited.
* Blokzijl has a small marina, surrounded by picturesque old brick houses from the 17th century, looking like miniatures of the Amsterdam canal houses.
* Vollenhove has two remarkable old churches (15th and 17th century), the castle ruins of Toutenburg with a park, the estate Old Ruitenborgh (18th century; small hotel with a good restaurant) and several old houses, of which the former Latin School (17th century) is the most beautiful.
* Giethoorn and Dwarsgracht are picturesque due to their local structure (see above); many of the old farmhouses have been transformed into &quot;second homes&quot; where rich Dutchmen live during their holidays. In summer, most houses of the village are lit in the evening, which enables the Tourist Board to organise romantic guided boat tours. Of course, a yacht-basin, restaurants and camping sites are there as well.
* Between Kuinre and Steenwijk lies the National Park &quot;De Weerribben&quot;, a very valuable wetland area with bogs, swamps, small canals and meadows. It can be visited on guided tours. The entrance is in Ossenzijl. For information ask the VVV (Tourist Board) or the owner, the &quot;Natuurmonumenten&quot; organization (on their website, type under: Zoeken ( = Search) the name of the area).
* A similar natural reserve called &quot;De Wieden&quot; is situated in the southern part of the municipality. An information centre is situated in St. Jansklooster near Vollenhove. &quot;Wieden&quot; means: wide places, wide lakes. These lakes are suitable for sailing, windsurfing etc.

<doc id="118474" wikidata="Q217192" url="?curid=118474" title="Dark Ages (historiography)">
<text>The Dark Ages is a term for the Early Middle Ages (–10th centuries), or occasionally the entire Middle Ages (–15th centuries), in Western Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which characterises it as marked by economic, intellectual, and cultural decline.

The concept of a &quot;Dark Age&quot; as a historiographical periodization originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar Petrarch, who regarded the post-Roman centuries as &quot;dark&quot; compared to the &quot;light&quot; of classical antiquity. The term employs traditional light-versus-darkness imagery to contrast the era&#x27;s supposed &quot;darkness&quot; (ignorance and error) with earlier and later periods of &quot;light&quot; (knowledge and understanding). The phrase &quot;Dark Age(s)&quot; itself derives from the Latin &quot;saeculum obscurum&quot;, originally applied by Caesar Baronius in 1602 when he referred to a tumultuous period in the 10th and 11th centuries. The concept thus came to characterize the entire Middle Ages as a time of intellectual darkness in Europe between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance, and became especially popular during the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment. Others, however, have used the term to denote the relative scarcity of written records regarding at least the early part of the Middle Ages.

As the accomplishments of the era came to be better understood in the 19th and the 20th centuries, scholars began restricting the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; appellation to the Early Middle Ages; today&#x27;s scholars maintain this posture. The majority of modern scholars avoid the term altogether because of its negative connotations, finding it misleading and inaccurate. Despite this, Petrarch&#x27;s pejorative meaning remains in use, particularly in popular culture, which often oversimplifies the Middle Ages as a time of violence and backwardness.

==History==

===Petrarch===
The idea of a Dark Age originated with the Tuscan scholar Petrarch in the 1330s. Writing of the past, he said: &quot;Amidst the errors there shone forth men of genius; no less keen were their eyes, although they were &quot;surrounded by darkness&quot; and dense gloom&quot;. Christian writers, including Petrarch himself, had long used traditional metaphors of &#x27;light versus darkness&#x27; to describe &#x27;good versus evil&#x27;. Petrarch was the first to give the metaphor secular meaning by reversing its application. He now saw classical antiquity, so long considered a &#x27;dark&#x27; age for its lack of Christianity, in the &#x27;light&#x27; of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch&#x27;s own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.

From his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the Roman period and classical antiquity as an expression of greatness. He spent much of his time traveling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic Latin and Greek texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity. Renaissance humanists saw the preceding 900 years as a time of stagnation, with history unfolding not along the religious outline of Saint Augustine&#x27;s Six Ages of the World, but in &quot;cultural&quot; (or secular) terms through progressive development of classical ideals, literature, and art.

Petrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of Greeks and Romans, followed by a time of darkness in which he saw himself living. In around 1343, in the conclusion of his epic &quot;Africa&quot;, he wrote: &quot;My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance.&quot; In the 15th century, historians Leonardo Bruni and Flavio Biondo developed a three-tier outline of history. They used Petrarch&#x27;s two ages, plus a modern, &#x27;better age&#x27;, which they believed the world had entered. Later, the term &#x27;Middle Ages&#x27; – Latin &quot;media tempestas&quot; (1469) or &quot;medium aevum&quot; (1604), was used to describe the period of supposed decline.

===Reformation===
During the Reformations of the 16th and 17th centuries, Protestants generally had a similar view to Renaissance humanists such as Petrarch, but also added an anti-Catholic perspective. They saw classical antiquity as a golden time not only because of its Latin literature but also because it witnessed the beginnings of Christianity. They promoted the idea that the &#x27;Middle Age&#x27; was a time of darkness also because of corruption within the Catholic Church, such as popes ruling as kings, veneration of saints&#x27; relics, a licentious priesthood and institutionalized moral hypocrisy.

===Baronius===
In response to the Protestants, Catholics developed a counter-image to depict the High Middle Ages in particular as a period of social and religious harmony and not &#x27;dark&#x27; at all. The most important Catholic reply to the &quot;Magdeburg Centuries&quot; was the &quot;Annales Ecclesiastici&quot; by Cardinal Caesar Baronius. Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; in 1911 described as &quot;far surpassing anything before&quot; and that Acton regarded as &quot;the greatest history of the Church ever written&quot;. The &quot;Annales&quot; covered the first twelve centuries of Christianity to 1198 and was published in twelve volumes between 1588 and 1607. It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term &quot;dark age&quot; for the period between the end of the Carolingian Empire in 888 and the first stirrings of Gregorian Reform under Pope Clement II in 1046:

Significantly, Baronius termed the age &#x27;dark&#x27; because of the paucity of written records. The &quot;lack of writers&quot; he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in Migne&#x27;s &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot; containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called &#x27;dark&#x27;) with the number containing the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.

There is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a certain recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something that the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a &#x27;dark age&#x27;, in Baronius&#x27;s sense of a &quot;lack of writers&quot;, between the Carolingian Renaissance in the 9th century and the beginnings, sometime in the 11th, of what has been called the Renaissance of the 12th century. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of &quot;lack of writers&quot; during the 7th and 8th centuries. Therefore, in Western Europe, two &#x27;dark ages&#x27; can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief Carolingian Renaissance.

Baronius&#x27; &#x27;dark age&#x27; seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to spread to various European languages, with his original Latin term &quot;&quot; being reserved for the period to which he had applied it. Some, following Baronius, used &#x27;dark age&#x27; neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records, but others used it pejoratively and lapsed into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.

The first British historian to use the term was most likely Gilbert Burnet, in the form &#x27;darker ages&#x27; which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the &quot;Epistle Dedicatory&quot; to Volume I of &quot;The History of the Reformation of the Church of England&quot; of 1679, where he writes: &quot;The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first, and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages.&quot; He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of &quot;St George&#x27;s fighting with the dragon&quot; as &quot;a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry&quot;. Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.

===Enlightenment===
During the Age of Enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them the Middle Ages, or &quot;Age of Faith&quot;, was therefore the opposite of the Age of Reason. Baruch Spinoza, Bernard Fontenelle, Immanuel Kant, David Hume, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Denis Diderot,
Voltaire, Marquis De Sade and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion, while Gibbon in &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; expressed contempt for the &quot;rubbish of the Dark Ages&quot;. Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a &quot;new age&quot;, was criticising the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.

Consequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch&#x27;s original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a &quot;dark&quot; age, their times were still not &quot;light&quot; enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the &quot;real&quot; Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call Early Modern times. Additionally, Petrarch&#x27;s metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and anti-clerical meaning.

===Romanticism===
In the late 18th and the early 19th centuries, the Romantics reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a vogue for medievalism. The word &quot;Gothic&quot; had been a term of opprobrium akin to &quot;Vandal&quot; until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English &quot;Goths&quot; like Horace Walpole initiated the Gothic Revival in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an &quot;Age of Faith&quot;. This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment rationalism, expressed a romantic view of a Golden Age of chivalry. The Middle Ages were seen with nostalgia as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the French Revolution and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and utilitarianism of the developing Industrial Revolution. The Romantics&#x27; view is still represented in modern-day fairs and festivals celebrating the period with &#x27;merrie&#x27; costumes and events.

Just as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light and darkness, the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period that they idealized was largely the High Middle Ages, extending into Early Modern times. In one respect, that negated the religious aspect of Petrarch&#x27;s judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.

==Modern scholarly use==
The term was widely used by 19th-century historians. In 1860, in &quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot;, Jacob Burckhardt delineated the contrast between the medieval &#x27;dark ages&#x27; and the more enlightened Renaissance, which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity. The earliest entry for a capitalized &quot;Dark Ages&quot; in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) is a reference in Henry Thomas Buckle&#x27;s &quot;History of Civilization in England&quot; in 1857, who wrote: &quot;During these, which are rightly called the Dark Ages, the clergy were supreme.&quot; The OED in 1894 defined an uncapitalised &quot;dark ages&quot; as &quot;a term sometimes applied to the period of the Middle Ages to mark the intellectual darkness characteristic of the time&quot;. Since the Late Middle Ages significantly overlap with the Renaissance, the term &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27; became restricted to distinct times and places in medieval Europe. Thus the 5th and 6th centuries in Britain, at the height of the Saxon invasions, have been called &quot;the darkest of the Dark Ages&quot;. 

The term &quot;Dark Ages&quot; was increasingly questioned from the mid-twentieth century as archaeological, historical and literary studies led to greater understanding of the period, In 1977, the historian Denys Hay spoke ironically of &quot;the lively centuries which we call dark&quot;. More forcefully, a book about the history of German literature published in 2007 describes &quot;the dark ages&quot; as &quot;a popular if uninformed manner of speaking&quot;.

Most modern historians do not use the term &quot;dark ages&quot; and prefer terms such as Early Middle Ages. However, when used by some historians today, the term &quot;Dark Ages&quot; is meant to describe the economic, political and cultural problems of the era. For others, the term Dark Ages is intended to be neutral, expressing the idea that the events of the period seem &#x27;dark&#x27; to us because of the paucity of the historical record. For example, Robert Sallares, commenting on the lack of sources to establish whether the plague pandemic of 541 to 750 reached Northern Europe, opines that &quot;the epithet &quot;Dark Ages&quot; is surely still an appropriate description of this period&quot;.

However, from the later 20th century onward, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term for two main reasons. Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term in a neutral way: scholars may intend it, but ordinary readers may not understand it so. Secondly, 20th-century scholarship had increased understanding of the history and culture of the period, to such an extent that it is no longer really &#x27;dark&#x27; to modern viewers. To avoid the value judgment implied by the expression, many historians now avoid it altogether. It was occasionally used up to the 1990s by historians of early medieval Britain, for example in the title of the 1991 book by Ann Williams, Alfred Smyth and D. P. Kirby, &quot;A Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain, England, Scotland and Wales, c.500–c.1050&quot;, and in the comment by Richard Abels in 1998 that the greatness of Alfred the Great &quot;was the greatness of a Dark Age king&quot;. In 2020, John Blair, Stephen Rippon and Christopher Smart observed that: &quot;The days when archaeologists and historians referred to the fifth to the tenth centuries as the &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27; are long gone, and the material culture produced during that period demonstrates a high degree of sophistication.&quot;

==Modern non-scholarly use==

A 2021 lecture by Howard Williams of Chester University explored how &quot;stereotypes and popular perceptions of the Early Middle Ages – popularly still considered the European &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27; – plague popular culture&quot;; and finding &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27; is &quot;rife outside of academic literature, including in newspaper articles and media debates.&quot; As to why it is used, according to Williams, legends and racial misunderstandings have been revitalized by modern nationalists, colonialists and imperialists around present-day concepts of identity, faith and origin myths i.e. appropriating historical myths for modern political ends.

In a book about medievalisms in popular culture by Andrew B. R. Elliott (2017), he found &quot;by far&quot; the most common use of &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27; is to &quot;signify a general sense of backwardness or lack of technological sophistication&quot;, in particular noting how it has become entrenched in daily and political discourse. Reasons for use, according to Elliott, are often &quot;banal medievalisms&quot;, which are &quot;characterized mainly by being unconscious, unwitting and by having little or no intention to refer to the Middle Ages&quot;; for example, referring to an insurance industry still reliant on paper instead of computers as being in the &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27;. These banal uses are little more than tropes that inherently contain a criticism about lack of progress. Elliott connects &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27; to the &quot;Myth of Progress&quot;, also observed by Joseph Tainter, who says, &quot;There is genuine bias against so-called &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27;&quot; because of a modern belief that society normally traverses from lesser to greater complexity, and when complexity is reduced during a collapse, this is perceived as out of the ordinary and thus undesirable; he counters that complexity is rare in human history, a costly mode of organization that must be constantly maintained, and periods of less complexity are common and to be expected as part of the overall progression towards greater complexity.

In Peter S. Wells&#x27;s 2008 book, &quot;Barbarians to Angels: The Dark Ages Reconsidered&quot;, he writes, &quot;I have tried to show that far from being a period of cultural bleakness and unmitigated violence, the centuries (5th - 9th) known popularly as the Dark Ages were a time of dynamic development, cultural creativity, and long-distance networking&quot;. He writes that our &quot;popular understanding&quot; of these centuries &quot;depends largely on the picture of barbarian invaders that Edward Gibbon presented more than two hundred years ago,&quot; and that this view has been accepted &quot;by many who have read and admire Gibbon&#x27;s work.&quot;

David C. Lindberg, a science and religion historian, says the &#x27;Dark Ages&#x27; are &quot;according to wide-spread popular belief&quot; portrayed as &quot;a time of ignorance, barbarism and superstition&quot;, for which he asserts &quot;blame is most often laid at the feet of the Christian church&quot;. Medieval historian Matthew Gabriele echoes this view as a myth of popular culture. Andrew B. R. Elliott notes the extent to which &quot;Middle Ages/Dark Ages have come to be synonymous with religious persecution, witch hunts and scientific ignorance&quot;.

<text>Vinayak Narahari Bhave, also known as Vinoba Bhave (; 11 September 1895 – 15 November 1982), was an Indian advocate of nonviolence and human rights. Often called Acharya (Teacher in Sanskrit), he is best known for the Bhoodan Movement. He is considered as National Teacher of India and the spiritual successor of Mahatma Gandhi. He was an eminent philosopher. He translated the Bhagavad Gita into the Marathi language by him with the title &quot;Geetai&quot; (meaning &#x27;Mother Gīta&#x27; in Marathi).

==Early life and background==
Vinayak Narahari Bhave was born on 11 September 1895 in a small village called Gagoji (present-day Gagode Budruk) in Kolaba in the Konkan region of what is now Maharashtra. Vinayaka was the eldest son of Narahari Shambhu Rao and Rukmani Devi. The couple had five children; four sons named Vinayaka (affectionately called Vinya), Balakrishna, Shivaji and Dattatreya, and one daughter. His father was a trained weaver with a modern rationalist outlook and worked in Baroda. Vinayaka was brought up by his grandfather, Shamburao Bhave and was greatly influenced by his mother Rukmini Devi, a religious woman from Karnataka. Vinayaka was highly inspired after reading the Bhagavad Gita, at a very young age.

A report in the newspapers about Gandhi&#x27;s speech at the newly founded Banaras Hindu University attracted Bhave&#x27;s attention. In 1916, after reading a newspaper piece by Mahatma Gandhi, Bhave threw his school and college certificates into a fire on his way to Bombay to appear for the intermediate examination. 
He wrote a letter to Gandhi and after an exchange of letters, Gandhi advised Bhave to come for a personal meeting at Kochrab Ashram in Ahmedabad. Bhave met Gandhi on 7 June 1916 and subsequently abandoned his studies. Bhave participated with a keen interest in the activities at Gandhi&#x27;s ashram, like teaching, studying, spinning and improving the lives of the community. His involvement with Gandhi&#x27;s constructive programmes related to Khadi, village industries, new education (Nai Talim), sanitation and hygiene also kept on increasing.

Bhave went to Wardha on 8 April 1921 to take charge of the Ashram as desired by Gandhi. In 1923, he brought out &quot;Maharashtra Dharma&quot;, a Marathi monthly which had his essays on the Upanishads. Later on, this monthly became a weekly and continued for three years. In 1925, Gandhi sent him to Vaikom, Kerala to supervise the entry of the Harijans to the temple.

Bhave was arrested several times during the 1920s and 1930s and served a five-year jail sentence in the 1940s for leading non-violent resistance to British rule. The jails for Bhave had become the places of reading and writing. He wrote Ishavasyavritti and Sthitaprajna Darshan in jail. He also learnt four South Indian languages and created the script of Lok Nagari at Vellore jail. In the jails, he gave a series of talks on the Bhagavad Gita in Marathi, to his fellow prisoners. Bhave participated in the nationwide civil disobedience periodically conducted against the British and was imprisoned with other nationalists. Despite these many activities, he was not well known to the public. He gained national prominence when Gandhi chose him as the first participant in a new nonviolent campaign in 1940. All were calling him by his short name, Vinoba.
Bhave&#x27;s younger brother Balkrishna was also a Gandhian. Gandhi entrusted him and Manibhai Desai to set up a nature therapy ashram at Urali Kanchan where Balkrishna spent all his life.

==Career==
===Freedom struggle===

He was associated with Mahatma Gandhi in the Indian independence movement. He stayed for some time at Gandhi&#x27;s Sabarmati ashram in a cottage that was named after him, &#x27;Vinoba Kutir&#x27;. He gave talks on the Bhagavad Gita in Marathi to his fellow ashramites. These were later published in book form, as &quot;Talks on the Gita&quot;, and it has been translated into many languages both in India and elsewhere. Bhave felt that the source of these talks was something from above and he believed that its influence would endure even if his other works were forgotten.

In the year 1940, he was chosen by Gandhi to be the first individual Satyagrahi (an individual standing up for Truth instead of a collective action) against the British colonisation. It is said that Gandhi envied and respected Bhave&#x27;s celibacy, a vow he made in his adolescence, in fitting with his belief in the Brahmacharya principle. Bhave also participated in the Quit India Movement.

===Religious and social work===

Bhave&#x27;s religious outlook was very broad and it synthesized the truths of many religions. This can be seen in one of his hymns &quot;Om Tat Sat&quot; which contains symbols of many religions. His slogan &quot;जय जगत्&quot; (Jay Jagat) i.e. &quot;victory to the world&quot; finds reflection in his views about the world as a whole.

Bhave observed the life of the average Indian living in a village and tried to find solutions for the problems he faced with a firm spiritual foundation. This formed the core of his &quot;Sarvodaya movement&quot;. Another example of this is the Bhoodan (land gift) movement started at Pochampally on 18 April 1951, after interacting with 80 Harijan families. He walked all across India asking people with land to consider him one of their sons and so gave him one-sixth of their land which he then distributed to the landless poor. Non-violence and compassion is a hallmarks of his philosophy, he also campaigned against the slaughtering of cows.

Bhave said, &quot;I have walked all over India for 13 years. In the backdrop of the enduring perpetuity of my life&#x27;s work, I have established 6 ashrams.&quot;

===Brahma Vidya Mandir (BVM)===
The Brahma Vidya Mandir was founded in 1959 in Paunar, Maharashtra and is one of the ashrams established by Bhave. It was created for women to become self-sufficient and practice non-violence within the community. They used Gandhi&#x27;s beliefs, which was heavily influenced by the &quot;Bhagavad-Gita&quot;, to aid in agricultural practices that were non-violent and produce sustainable food. The community performed prayers as a group every day, reciting from the Isha Upanishad at dawn, the Vishnu Sahasranama at mid-morning, and the &quot;Bhagavad-Gita&quot; in the evening. As of today, there are around 25 women who are members of the community and several men have also been allowed to join the community.

BVM&#x27;s existence demonstrates how a self sufficient community can apply non-violence and radical democracy to their own social and geographic context in food production. One mainstream narrative is that large-scale agriculture is &quot;inevitable, necessary, and the sole possibility of feeding the world&quot; and relies on expensive technology. However, BVM rejects this narrative and continues to use Gandhian principles in agriculture such as nonviolence. It is a small community in India and does not hold much influence to promote its beliefs and practices in the mainstream. Most agricultural practices in India has adopted US-style consumerism. BVM is still important as its ideals can help shape agriculture for the better and focus less on profit.

===Literary career===
Vinoba Bhave was a scholar, thinker, and writer who produced numerous books. He was a translator who made Sanskrit texts accessible to the common man. He was also an orator and linguist with an excellent command of several languages (Marathi, Kannada, Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu, English, and Sanskrit).

Bhave was an innovative social reformer. He called &quot;Kannada&quot; script the &quot;Queen of World Scripts&quot; (&quot;Vishwa Lipigala Raani&quot;). He wrote brief introductions to, and criticisms of, several religious and philosophical works like the Bhagavad Gita, works of Adi Shankaracharya, the Bible and the Quran. His views of Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s poetry and works by other Marathi saints are pretty brilliant and a testimony to the breadth of his intellect.

Bhave had translated the Bhagavad Gita into Marathi. He was deeply influenced by the Gita and attempted to imbibe its teachings into his life, often stating that &quot;The Gita is my life&#x27;s breath&quot;.

Vinoba Bhave University, located in Hazaribagh district in the state of Jharkhand, is named after him.

===Vinoba Bhave and Land Donation Movement===
On 18 April 1951, Bhave started his land donation movement at Pochampally of Nalgonda district Telangana, the Bhoodan Movement. He took donated land from landowner Indians and gave
it away to the poor and landless, for them to cultivate. Then after 1954, he started to ask for donations from whole villages in a programme he called Gramdan. He got more than 1000 villages by way of donations. Out of these, he obtained 175 donated villages in Tamil Nadu alone. Noted Gandhian and an atheist Lavanam was the interpreter for Bhave during his land reform movement in Andhra Pradesh and parts of Orissa.

==Later life and death==

Bhave spent the later part of his life at his Brahma Vidya Mandir ashram in Paunar in Wardha district of Maharashtra. He died on 15 November 1982 after refusing food and medicine for a few days by accepting &quot;Samadhi Maran&quot; / &quot;Santhara&quot; as described in Jainism. Then the Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, who was visiting Moscow to attend the funeral of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, cut short her visit to be at the Bhave&#x27;s funeral.

==Criticism==
V.S. Naipaul has scathingly criticised Bhave in his collection of essays citing his lack of connection with rationality and excessive imitation of Gandhi. Even some of his admirers find fault with the extent of his devotion to Gandhi. Much more controversial was his support, ranging from covert to open, to the Congress Party&#x27;s government under Indira Gandhi, which was fast becoming unpopular. He controversially backed the Indian Emergency imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, calling it &quot;Anushasana Parva&quot; (&quot;Time for Discipline&quot;). Jayaprakash Narayan in his prison diary during the emergency sarcastically wrote about the meaning of Anushasan Parva. Congress party opponents at that time had coined the derogatory term &quot;Sarkari Sant (Government Saint)&quot; to describe him. Noted Marathi writer Pra Ke Atre publicly criticised him and mocked him by writing an article titled &quot;Vanaroba&quot; which is a disambiguation of the name &quot;Vinoba&quot; and means monkey.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1958 Bhave was the first recipient of the international Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1983.

&quot;Vinoba Bhave, The Man&quot;, a documentary film on the social-reformer directed by Vishram Bedekar was released in 1963. It was produced by the Government of India&#x27;s Films Division. Indian film director Sarvottam Badami had earlier made another documentary on him, &quot;Vinoba Bhave&quot;, in 1951.

<doc id="118476" wikidata="Q6707839" url="?curid=118476" title="Lyke Wake Walk">
<text>The Lyke Wake Walk is a challenge walk across the highest and widest part of the North York Moors National Park in North Yorkshire, England. The route remembers the many corpses carried over the moors on old coffin routes and the ancient burial mounds encountered on the way; the name derives from a lyke, the corpse and the wake - watching over the deceased. Its associated club has a social structure, culture and rituals based on the walk and Christian and folklore traditions from the area through which it passes.

==History==

The idea of a walk originated from an article in the &quot;Dalesman&quot; magazine in August 1955. Its author, Bill Cowley, described a walk across the North York Moors from east to west (or vice versa) on heather all the way except for when crossing one or two roads. Given the remoteness of the area, a lone walker might not encounter another during the one to two day journey. Cowley issued a challenge to see if anyone could walk from Scarth Wood Moor at the western extremity of the moors to Ravenscar on the coast, keeping on or close to the main watershed of the moorland, in a twenty-four-hour period. The first crossing was completed shortly afterwards on 1 and 2 October 1955. Cowley was in the party that made the crossing in 23 hours and he wrote a book, &quot;Lyke Wake Walk&quot;, which he kept up to date by frequent revision. The book ran to twelve editions in the author&#x27;s lifetime and sold many thousands of copies. It was revised in 2001 by Paul Sherwood.

Cowley&#x27;s idea developed over the years before he issued the challenge in 1955. He wrote a poem, originally dated 1937, &quot;Storm Longing&quot;, describing walking on the moors and mentioning a number of the walk&#x27;s landmarks (after the walk was established, he adapted the poem slightly to fit the actual Lyke Wake Walk better). His early contributions to the &quot;Dalesman&quot; appear, in retrospect, to hint at the idea of the walk drawing on his appreciation of the works of the archaeologist Frank Elgee, antiquarian and folklore expert Canon John Christopher Atkinson and author and rambler Alfred J. Brown.

==Route==

The walk is usually done from west to east although it can be done in either direction. A successful crossing must be completed within 24 hours. There is no exact route but the Lyke Wake Club and its successor have rules regarding what can be considered a successful crossing. For record purposes the walk starts at its original departure point, the Ordnance Survey Trig point on Scarth Wood Moor, near Osmotherley (NGR: SE 459 997) and finishes in the bar of the Raven Hall Hotel in Ravenscar (NGR: NZ 981 018). For practical purposes the acceptable end points are the Lyke Wake Stone adjacent to Sheep Wash car park at Cod Beck Reservoir at the western end (NGR: SE 467 992) and Beacon Howes car park where there is a second Lyke Wake Stone at the eastern end (NGR: NZ 969 012). Successful crossings must stick to the moorland summits as far as practicable and walkers straying into Eskdale are disqualified. The route crosses the Stokesley-Helmsley road (B1257) between Point 842 (Clay Bank Top) and Point 503 (Orterley Lane end), the Whitby-Pickering road (A169) between Point 945 (Sil Howe) and Point 701 (near Saltergate) and the Scarborough-Whitby road (A171) between Point 538 (Evan Howe) and Point 579 (Falcon Inn). Point numbers are the height in feet above sea level as given on the one inch Ordnance Survey Tourist Map of the North York Moors (1970 edition); the metric equivalents are identified on the Landranger and Explorer Series maps.
The original route began at Scarth Wood Moor trig point, followed the Alum/Jet Miners Track from Live Moor to Hasty Bank, then to Smuggler&#x27;s Trod, Bloworth, Ironstone Railway, Esklets, White Cross (Fat Betty), Shunner Howe, Hamer, Blue Man-i&#x27;-th&#x27;-Moss, Wheeldale Stepping Stones, Fen House, Tom Cross Rigg, Snod Hill, Lilla Howe, Jugger Howe ravine, Helwath, Pye Howe Rigg, to Ravenscar (Raven Hall Hotel). This route is no longer possible as a section is within the Ministry of Defence controlled area at RAF Fylingdales Early Warning Radar Station.
Most crossings now follow the classic route, a variation of the original. It begins at Scarth Wood Moor trig point or the western Lyke Wake Stone in Sheepwash car park, follows the summit track from Live Moor over Carlton Moor, Cringle Moor, Cold Moor and Hasty Bank, Smuggler&#x27;s Trod, Bloworth, Ironstone Railway, Esklets or South Flat Howe or Lion Inn, White Cross (Fat Betty), Shunner Howe, Hamer, Blue Man-i&#x27;-th&#x27;-Moss, Wheeldale Stepping Stones, Fen Bogs, Eller Beck, Lilla Howe, Jugger Howe ravine, Stony Marl Moor, to the eastern Lyke Wake Stone at Beacon Howes or Ravenscar. A summary description of the classic route with photographs is described by Richard Gilbert in his book, &quot;The Big Walks&quot; and a guidebook is available. A detailed illustrated description of the western half of the walk is given in Alfred Wainwright&#x27;s &quot; A Coast to Coast Walk&quot;. The classic route and the main alternatives are shown in the map.

Most crossings are done west to east. The original challenge, crossing towards the sea in an easterly direction is thought to be easier because of the prevailing wind from the west making it easier to walk with the wind on one&#x27;s back and with the heather lying away from the walker. On a west to east crossing, the major ascents and descents occur in the first ten miles when the walker is relatively fresh. A traverse of the Lyke Wake Walk route is referred to as a crossing and the act of participating in the walk is known as dirging.

In the first few years, the walk followed a difficult route requiring endeavour and physical endurance as there was no track over most of its length. From the mid-1970s the walk was re-thought because the numbers of people attempting it had, in places, eroded the ground surface, and disturbance to game birds, sheep and wildlife by walkers and their support parties at all times of day and night, particularly in Osmotherley, Ravenscar and at remote farms. Footpath erosion was compounded by the walk sharing long stretches of its route with the Cleveland Way and Wainwright&#x27;s Coast to Coast Walk. Other users, some legal, some illegal, including mountain bikes, motor cycles, quad bikes and agricultural and moorland management vehicles exacerbated the problem. Alternative routes are possible and the walk club works with the National Park authority to try to limit environmental damage.

The Ordnance Survey no longer marks the walk route on maps at the recommendation of the National Park Authority, as a measure to discourage large numbers undertaking a crossing and the walk was not mentioned in National Park Authority publication for a number of years. 
===Other long-distance walks in the area===
Alternative challenge walks and trails include the Hambleton Hobble, the Shepherd&#x27;s Round, the White Rose Walk, the Lyke Wake Way, the Monk&#x27;s Trod, the Rail Trail, Hambleton Drove Road, the Crosses Walk and the long distance trails. A walk from west to east across the North York Moors around ten miles south of the Lyke Wake Walk from Gormire Lake to Cloughton Wyke termed, in a play on words, the Lake Wyke Walk has been suggested.

The Lyke Wake Way is a non-challenge alternative from Osmotherley to Ravenscar on public rights of way via locations where accommodation and other facilities are available. It entails of walking depending on the route taken and can be completed over two or three days.
Alfred Wainwright suggested the walk could form an acceptable finish to his Coast to Coast Walk but did not specify if he recommends doing the in a single push. There is no record of Wainwright completing the walk. There are no constraints on doing the walk in a more leisurely manner and a guide to doing the walk over four days has been published.

==Lyke Wake Clubs==
The first Lyke Wake Club was formed immediately on completion of the first crossing. Those completing the first crossing were its foundation members.

The walk takes its name from the &quot;Lyke-Wake Dirge&quot;, probably Yorkshire&#x27;s oldest surviving dialect verse, which is about watching over the wake of the corpse &quot;(lyke)&quot;. Cowley proposed linking the walk and the dirge before the first crossing had been completed. The song tells of the soul&#x27;s passage through the afterlife. The walk does not follow a corpse road, although it has been suggested it does, though there is no historical or archaeological evidence for it. The physical challenge, possibility of bad weather and difficult conditions make the dirge an appropriate club song.

The club established its own culture and developed traditions based around the dirge, aspects of Cleveland history, superstitions and folklore, and rituals associated with suffering, death, funerals and the after-life that are broadly Yorkshire, northern English and Christian in character, with an acknowledgement of local folklore and the pagan forebears who originally inhabited the moorlands. Club meetings were termed &quot;wakes&quot; and the club badge was coffin shaped and decorated with the Ordnance Survey symbol for a tumulus (burial mound), many of which are found along the route. Its culture is of solemnity regarding issues of ritual, folklore and mortality but with light-hearted aspects relating to the self-inflicted suffering of participants undertaking the walk. Club membership was/is granted on submission of a written report of a successful crossing and entitles successful walkers to a membership card in the form of a black-edged condolence card bearing the club crest, a black coffin. Many crossing reports are humorous and in various forms including prose, poetry, maps, post-mortem reports, last wills and testaments, plays, etc., some of which are quoted in the many editions of Cowley&#x27;s &quot;Lyke Wake Walk&quot; book and in a separate volume devoted to literature and artwork contributed by members. Female members are termed &quot;Witches&quot;, males are &quot;Dirgers&quot;.
The walk emerged when outdoor challenges and sponsored fund-raising events were becoming a feature of national life. It became popular and was considered a &quot;rite of passage&quot; for outdoor enthusiasts in Yorkshire in particular and across the north of England. It became a challenge for fundraisers for good causes. Reliable estimates, based on club records, put the number of people having completed a crossing at more than 250,000. Possibly more than 30,000 made more than one crossing, a significant number have completed it more than ten times and a handful have made more than a hundred. One estimate put the total number of crossings up to 1994 at one million, but this is not supported by records. The club celebrates walkers who have undertaken multiple crossings with awards called degrees acknowledging their knowledge of the route, the moorland and its culture. The club designated Cowley as &quot;Chief Dirger&quot; and other officers included a Melancholy Mace Bearer, Harassed Archivists, Melodious Minstrels, a Cheerless Chaplain, a Horrible Horn-blower and an Anxious Almoner. Degrees conferred include Master/Mistress of Misery, Doctor of Dolefulness and Past Master/Mistress. Walkers who completed more than one hundred crossings are referred to as Senile Centenarians and as of March 2016, four people have achieved this landmark.) The requirements for degrees are:

The New Lyke Wake Club has instituted the degree of &quot;Purveyor of Purgatory&quot; for leaders who have successfully, and without mishap, conducted three (or more) parties on the walk. It can be awarded &quot;in absentia&quot; but the other degrees are only awarded when the recipient is in attendance at a wake.

The walk&#x27;s popularity owes much to Cowley&#x27;s book which gives insights into the history, archaeology, geography, natural history, and folklore of the moors. The book describes the club and its culture in a tongue-in-cheek humorous style. Its first edition contained a list of the successful crossings up to October 1958. The possibility of inclusion in future editions together with the use of quotes from some crossing reports became an incentive to those taking on the challenge and inspired correspondents to be inventive and &quot;attain literary heights&quot;.

Cowley died on 14 August 1994. The Lyke Wake Club, he founded, closed in October 2005, the walk&#x27;s 50th anniversary. A new club has been established – not without controversy – to preserve the traditions established by Cowley and take over the old club&#x27;s functions of recording crossings, holding wakes and liaising with public authorities. The New Lyke Wake Club&#x27;s activities have included donating funds to the North York Moors National Park young explorers conservation group, Cleveland Search and Rescue Team, and a short story competition for schools within the National Park. The new club maintains up-to-date route information on its website, funds footpath repairs and removes litter along the route, and gives grants to young club members for educational and outdoor pursuits purposes.
Both the original and new clubs&#x27; criterion for membership is the completion of a crossing within 24 hours, and there are no honorary, associate or corporate members. A concession is that anyone can claim an extra 12 hours for every five years over the age of 65 but, although there have been crossings by older walkers, some over eighty years old, there is no record of any of them claiming the concession. In earlier years signing in/out books were kept at the Queen Catherine Hotel in Osmotherley and at Pollard Cafe in Ravenscar. The Lyke Wake Clubs have not monitored individual crossings for compliance with the rules, as Cowley stated &quot;No one who is going to do this Walk is going to cheat, the satisfactions of crossing successfully are entirely for the individual&quot;.

==Lyke Wake Race==
Once the route became established as a clear track, the Lyke Wake Club considered the possibility of holding a race. The first Lyke Wake Race was held in 1964 and was held annually on the nearest Saturday to 10 July (except 2001 when it was cancelled because of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease) until 2014, its 50th anniversary when the organisers ceased to be involved. In 2015, the race continued with the organisation undertaken by the Quakers Running Club. It has been held every July since, until the 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resuming in 2022.

The first race was organised to coincide with the Osmotherley Summer Games. It started at Beacon Howes with the finishing line in Osmotherley. Both events were organised on the same date for a number of years. In the early years the Puckrin brothers, Arthur, Philip and Richard, were prominent amongst the leading runners with the first two brothers winning nine of the first ten races between them. Other winners have included prominent athletes/fell runners such as Joss Naylor. A history of the race up to 1981 has been given by Bill Smith. Since the Quakers took over the race, it has been held in an eastern direction, starting at Sheepwash and finishing in Ravenscar.

The tradition of the Lyke Wake Walk and Lyke Wake Race is that crossing times are rounded to next whole minute; seconds are not recorded.

The race is held under a handicap basis, with runners estimating their time beforehand and being given a different starting time on the estimation that all runners finish at the same time. Prizes are awarded for first male and female finishers and fastest male and female runners.

The race was first held in 1964, running from Ravenscar Beacon to Osmotherley. In 1976, due to moorland fires, the race was run out-and-back, starting in Osmotherley and taking in the first half of the traditional route. By 1998, the race was run from Sheepwash to Ravenscar, and in 2001 was cancelled entirely due to foot-and-mouth disease.

==Additional information==
The walk has attracted media interest with television coverage, radio programmes and print articles. In its 60th anniversary year, 2015, the BBC Radio 4 feature &quot;Ramblings&quot;, hosted by Clare Balding, dedicated an episode to the Lyke Wake Walk with broadcast dates 4 June and 6 June 2015.

The archives, records and artefacts of the original Lyke Wake Club have been deposited in the North Yorkshire County Archives in Northallerton and Ryedale Folk Museum, Hutton-le-Hole.

The &quot;Lyke Wake Dirge&quot; has been set to music. One notable setting is part of the &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot; by Benjamin Britten.

<text>The (; ), anglicised as Althingi or Althing, is the supreme national parliament of Iceland. It is the oldest surviving parliament in the world. The Althing was founded in 930 at (&#x27;thing fields&#x27; or &#x27;assembly fields&#x27;), about east of what later became the country&#x27;s capital, Reykjavík. After Iceland&#x27;s union with Norway in 1262, the Althing lost its legislative power, which was not restored until 1904 when Iceland gained home rule from Denmark. For 641 years, the Althing did not serve as the parliament of Iceland; ultimate power rested with the Norwegian, and subsequently the Danish throne. Even after Iceland&#x27;s union with Norway in 1262, the Althing still held its sessions at until 1800, when it was discontinued. It was restored in 1844 by royal decree and moved to Reykjavík. The restored unicameral legislature first came together in 1845 and after 1874 operated in two chambers with an additional third chamber taking on a greater role as the decades passed until 1991 when Althing became once again unicameral. The present parliament building, the , was built in 1881, made of hewn Icelandic stone. The unicameral parliament has 63 members, and is elected every four years based on party-list proportional representation. The current speaker of the Althing is Þórunn Sveinbjarnardóttir.

The constitution of Iceland provides for six electoral constituencies with the possibility of an increase to seven. The constituency boundaries and the number of seats allocated to each constituency are fixed by legislation. No constituency can be represented by fewer than six seats. Furthermore, each party with more than 5% of the national vote is allocated seats based on its proportion of the national vote in order that the number of members in parliament for each political party should be more or less proportional to its overall electoral support. If the number of voters represented by each member of the Althing in one constituency would be less than half of the comparable ratio in another constituency, the Icelandic National Electoral Commission is tasked with altering the allocation of seats to reduce that difference.

== Historical background ==

=== Foundation: c. 930–1262 ===
The Althing claims to be the longest-running parliament in the world. Its establishment as an outdoor assembly or &quot;thing&quot; held on the plains of (&#x27;Thing Fields&#x27; or &#x27;Assembly Fields&#x27;) from about 930, laid the foundation for an independent national existence in Iceland. To begin with, the Althing was a general assembly of the Icelandic Commonwealth, where the country&#x27;s most powerful leaders () met to decide on legislation and dispense justice. All free men could attend the assemblies, which were usually the main social event of the year and drew large crowds of farmers and their families, parties involved in legal disputes, traders, craftsmen, storytellers, and travellers. Those attending the assembly lived in temporary camps () during the session. The centre of the gathering was the , or Law Rock, a rocky outcrop on which the Lawspeaker () took his seat as the presiding official of the assembly. His responsibilities included reciting aloud the laws in effect at the time. It was his duty to proclaim the procedural law of the Althing to those attending the assembly each year.

The &quot;Gulathing Law&quot; was adopted in 930 at the first Althing, introduced by , who had spent three years in Norway studying their laws. The Icelandic laws conferred a privileged status on the Danes, Swedes and Norwegians.

According to , the Althing declared Christianity as the official religion in 1000. By the summer of 1000, the leaders of Iceland had agreed that prosecuting close relatives for blaspheming the old gods was obligatory. Iceland was in the midst of unrest from the spread of Christianity that was introduced by travelers and missionaries sent by the Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason. The outbreak of warfare in Denmark and Norway prompted , a pagan and chieftain of the Althing, to propose &quot;one law and one religion&quot; to rule over the whole of Iceland, making baptism and conversion to Christianity required by law.

Public addresses on matters of importance were delivered at the Law Rock and there the assembly was called to order and dissolved. The , the legislative section of the assembly, was its most powerful institution. It comprised the 39 district Chieftains (pl. ) plus nine additional members and the Lawspeaker. As the legislative section of the Althing, the took a stand on legal conflicts, adopted new laws and granted exemptions to existing laws. The Althing of old also performed a judicial function and heard legal disputes in addition to the spring assemblies held in each district. After the country had been divided into four-quarters around 965, a court of 36 judges () was established for each of them at the Althing. Another court () was established early in the 11th century. It served as a supreme court of sorts, and assumed the function of hearing cases left unsettled by the other courts. It comprised 48 judges appointed by the of .

=== Monarchy: 1262–1800 ===
When the Icelanders submitted to the authority of the Norwegian king under the terms of the &quot;Old Covenant&quot; () in 1262, the function of the Althing changed. The organization of the Commonwealth came to an end and the rule of the country by ceased. Executive power now rested with the king and his officials, the Royal Commissioners () and District Commissioners (). As before, the , now comprising 36 members, continued to be its principal institution and shared formal legislative power with the king. Laws adopted by the were subject to royal assent and, conversely, if the king initiated legislation, the Althing had to give its consent. The Lawspeaker was replaced by two legal administrators, called .

Towards the end of the 14th century, royal succession brought both Norway and Iceland under the control of the Danish monarchy. With the introduction of absolute monarchy in Denmark, the Icelanders relinquished their autonomy to the Crown, including the right to initiate and consent to legislation. After that, the Althing served almost exclusively as a court of law until the year 1800.

=== High Court: 1800–1845 ===
The Althing was disbanded by royal decree in 1800. A new High Court, established by this same decree and located in Reykjavík, took over the functions of Lögrétta. The three appointed judges first convened in Hólavallarskóli on 10 August 1801. The High Court was to hold regular sessions and function as the court of highest instance in the country. It operated until 1920, when the Supreme Court of Iceland was established.

=== Consultative assembly: 1845–1874 ===
A royal decree providing for the establishment of a new Althing was issued on 8 March 1843. Elections were held the following year and the assembly finally met on 1 July 1845 in Reykjavík. Some Icelandic nationalists (the Fjölnir group) did not want Reykjavík as the location for the newly established Althing due to the perception that the city was too influenced by Danes. Jón Sigurðsson claimed that the situating of the Althing in Reykjavík would help make the city Icelandic.

It comprised 26 members sitting in a single chamber. One member was elected in each of 20 electoral districts and six &quot;royally nominated Members&quot; were appointed by the king. Suffrage was, following the Danish model, limited to males of substantial means and at least 25 years of age, which to begin with meant only about 5% of the population. A regular session lasted four weeks and could be extended if necessary. During this period, the Althing acted merely as a consultative body for the Crown. It examined proposed legislation and individual members could raise questions for discussion. Draft legislation submitted by the government was given two readings, an introductory one and a final one. Proposals which were adopted were called petitions. The new Althing made a number of improvements to legislation and to the administration of the country.

=== Legislative assembly from 1874 ===

The Constitution of 1874 granted to the Althing joint legislative power with the Crown in matters of exclusive Icelandic concern. At the same time, the National Treasury acquired powers of taxation and financial allocation. The king retained the right to veto legislation and often, on the advice of his ministers, refused to consent to legislation adopted by the Althing. The number of members of the Althing was increased to 36, 30 of them elected in general elections in eight single-member constituencies and 11 double-member constituencies, the other six appointed by the Crown as before. The Althing was now divided into an upper chamber, known as the &quot;Efri deild&quot; and a lower chamber, known as the &quot;Neðri deild&quot;. Six elected members and the six appointed ones sat in the upper chamber, which meant that the latter could prevent legislation from being passed by acting as a bloc. Twenty-four elected representatives sat in the lower chamber. From 1874 until 1915 ad hoc committees were appointed. After 1915 seven standing committees were elected by each of the chambers. Regular sessions of the Althing convened every other year. A supplementary session was first held in 1886, and these became more frequent in the 20th century. The Althing met from 1881 in the newly built Parliament House. The Governor-General (&quot;landshöfðingi&quot;) was the highest representative of the government in Iceland and was responsible to the Advisor for Iceland (&quot;Íslandsráðgjafi&quot;) in Copenhagen.

=== Home rule ===
A constitutional amendment, confirmed on 3 October 1903, granted the Icelanders home rule and parliamentary government. Hannes Hafstein was appointed as the Icelandic minister on 1 February 1904 who was answerable to parliament. The minister had to have the support of the majority of members of the Althing; in the case of a vote of no confidence, he would have to step down. Under the constitutional amendment of 1903, the number of members was increased by four, to a total of forty. Elections to the Althing had traditionally been public – voters declared aloud which of the candidates they supported. In 1908, the secret ballot was adopted, with ballot papers on which the names of the candidates were printed. A single election day for the entire country was at the same time made mandatory. When the Constitution was amended in 1915, the royally nominated members of the Althing were replaced by six national representatives elected by proportional representation for the entire country.

=== Personal union ===
The Act of Union (which took effect on 1 December 1918) made Iceland a state in personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark. It was set to expire after 25 years, when either state could choose to leave the union. The Althing was granted unrestricted legislative power. In 1920, the number of members of the Althing was increased to 42. Since 1945, the Althing has customarily assembled in the autumn. With the Constitutional Act of 1934, the number of members was increased by seven and the system of national representatives abolished in favour of one providing for eleven seats used to equalize discrepancies between the parties&#x27; popular vote and the number of seats they received in the Althing, raising the number of members of the Althing to 49. In 1934, the voting age was also lowered to 21. Further changes in 1942 provided for an additional three members and introduced proportional representation in the double-member constituencies. The constituencies were then 28 in number: 21 single-member constituencies; six double-member constituencies; and Reykjavík, which elected eight members. With the additional eleven equalization seats, the total number of members was thus 52.

=== Republic ===
The union with Iceland was effectively made inoperable when the Kingdom of Denmark was occupied by Germany on 9 April 1940. On the following day, the Althing passed two resolutions, investing the Icelandic cabinet with the power of Head of State and declaring that Iceland would accept full responsibility for both foreign policy and coastal surveillance. A year later, the Althing adopted a law creating the position of Regent to represent the Crown. This position continued until the Act of Union was repealed, and the Republic of Iceland established, at a session of the Althing held at Þingvellir on 17 June 1944.

In 1959, the system of electoral districts was changed completely. The country was divided into eight constituencies with proportional representation in each, in addition to the previous eleven equalization seats. The total number of members elected was 60. In 1968, the Althing approved the lowering of the voting age to 20 years. A further amendment to the Constitution in 1984 increased the number of members to 63 and reduced the voting age to 18 years. Further major changes were introduced in the Althing in May 1991: the two chambers, by that point having identical election methods and identical membership, were merged into a single chamber, thus introducing unicameralism. By a constitutional amendment of June 1999, implemented in May 2003, the constituency system was again changed. The number of constituencies was cut from eight to six; constituency boundaries were to be fixed by law. There are currently twelve standing committees.

<text>Cyperus papyrus, better known by the common names papyrus, papyrus sedge, paper reed, Indian matting plant, or Nile grass, is a species of aquatic flowering plant belonging to the sedge family Cyperaceae. It is a tender herbaceous perennial, forming tall stands of reed-like swamp vegetation in shallow water.

In nature, it grows in full sun, in flooded swamps, and on lake margins throughout Africa (where it is native), Madagascar, and the Mediterranean region. It has been introduced to tropical regions worldwide, such as the Indian subcontinent, South America, and the Caribbean.

Along with its close relatives, papyrus sedge has a very long history of use by humans, notably by the Ancient Egyptians (as it is the source of papyrus paper, one of the first types of paper ever made). Parts of the plant can be eaten, and the highly buoyant stems can be made into boats. It is now often cultivated as an ornamental plant.

==Description==

This tall, robust aquatic plant can grow high, but on the margins of high altitude lakes such as Lake Naivasha in Kenya and Lake Tana in Ethiopia, at altitudes around the papyrus culms can measure up to in length, with an additional for the inflorescence (a spicate umbel; i.e. each of the up to one thousand rays of the umbel terminates in a spike of small flowers) for a total height of . Each culm is a single the longest known of any plant. At Lake Naivasha, the culms, triangular in cross-section, were as much as on a side in width. It forms a grass-like clump of triangular green stems that rise up from thick, woody rhizomes. Each stem is topped by a dense cluster of thin, bright green, thread-like rays around in length, resembling a feather duster when the plant is young. Greenish-brown flower clusters eventually appear at the ends of the rays, giving way to brown, nut-like fruits.

Although no leaves are apparent above the soil line, the younger parts of the rhizome are covered by red-brown, papery, triangular scales, which also cover the base of the culms. Technically, these are reduced leaves, so strictly it is not quite correct to call this plant fully &quot;leafless&quot;.

==Ecology==

Papyrus can be found in tropical rain forests, tolerating annual temperatures of and a soil pH of 6.0 to 8.5. It flowers in late summer, and prefers full sun to partly shady conditions. Like most tropical plants, it is sensitive to frost. In the United States, it has become invasive in Florida and has escaped from cultivation in Louisiana, California, and Hawaii.

Papyrus sedge forms vast stands in swamps, shallow lakes, and along stream banks throughout the wetter parts of Africa, but it has become rare in the Nile Delta. In deeper waters, it is the chief constituent of the floating, tangled masses of vegetation known as &quot;sudd&quot;. It also occurs in Madagascar, and some Mediterranean areas such as Sicily and the Levant.

The &quot;feather-duster&quot; flowering heads make ideal nesting sites for many social species of birds. As in most sedges, pollination is by wind, not insects, and the mature fruits after release are distributed by water.

Papyrus is a C4 sedge that forms highly productive monotypic stands over large areas of wetland in Africa.

==Cultivation==

The papyrus plant is relatively easy to grow from seed, though in Egypt, it is more common to split the rootstock, and grows quite fast once established. Extremely moist soil or roots sunken in the water is preferred and the plant can flower all year long. Vegetative propagation is the suggested process of creating new plants. It is done by splitting the rhizomes into small groups and planting normally. It can reach heights of up to 16 feet tall. &quot;C.&quot; &quot;papyrus&quot; is considered to be hardy in USDA hardiness zones 9 and 10.

&quot;C. papyrus&quot; and the dwarf cultivar &quot;C. papyrus&quot; &#x27;Nanus&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).

==Papyrus in history==
In Ancient Egypt, papyrus was used for various purposes such as baskets, sandals, blankets, medicine, incense, and boats. The woody root was used to make bowls and utensils, and was burned for fuel. The Papyrus Ebers refers to the use of soft papyrus tampons by Egyptian women in the 15th century BCE. Egyptians made efficient use of all parts of the plant. Papyrus was an important &quot;gift of the Nile&quot; which is still preserved and perpetuated in Egyptian culture.

Egyptians used the plant (which they called &quot;aaru&quot;, or the subspecies &quot;C. p. papyrus&quot;, which came very close to extinction, but was rediscovered in 1968.) for many purposes, including for making papyrus paper. Its name has an uncertain origin, but was rendered in Hellenistic Greek as πάπυρος.

In the Nile Delta, &quot;Cyperus papyrus&quot; was widely cultivated in ancient times. It is for example depicted on a restored stucco fragment from the palace of Amenhotep III near the present-day village of Malkata. Currently, only a small population remains in Egypt, in Wadi El Natrun. Theophrastus&#x27;s &quot;History of Plants&quot; (Book iv. 10) states that it grew in Syria, and according to Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, it was also a native plant of the Niger River and the Euphrates. Neither the explorer Peter Forsskål, an apostle of Carl Linnaeus, in the 18th century, nor the Napoleonic expedition saw it in the delta.

Aside from papyrus, several other members of the genus &quot;Cyperus&quot; may also have been involved in the multiple uses Egyptians found for the plant. Its flowering heads were linked to make garlands for the gods in gratitude. The pith of young shoots was eaten both cooked and raw. Its woody root made bowls and other utensils and was burned for fuel. From the stems were made reed boats (seen in bas-reliefs of the Fourth Dynasty showing men cutting papyrus to build a boat; similar boats are still made in southern Sudan), sails, mats, cloth, cordage, and sandals. Theophrastus states that King Antigonus made the rigging of his fleet of papyrus, an old practice illustrated by the ship&#x27;s cable, wherewith the doors were fastened when Odysseus slew the suitors in his hall (&quot;Odyssey&quot; xxi. 390).

The adventurer Thor Heyerdahl had a boat built for him of papyrus, &quot;Ra&quot;, in an attempt to demonstrate that ancient African or Mediterranean people could have reached America. He was unsuccessful with this boat. Fishermen in the Okavango Delta use small sections of the stem as floats for their nets.
