<text>Oxford is a village in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,436 at the 2010 census. The village is located within Oxford Township. Located about north of Detroit, it is a northern suburb of the Metro Detroit region.

==History==
During the early 19th century the northeast Oakland County area was largely avoided by the early settlers because it was believed to be nothing but impenetrable swamp land. The area was, at that time, nicknamed &quot;The Barren Plains of Oxford.&quot; It was called this primarily because of a report made in 1812 by the U.S. Surveyor General that described the area as a poor, barren, sandy land, on which scarcely any vegetation could grow with the exception of some very small scrubby oaks. It was concluded in the surveyors&#x27; report there was one acre out of one hundred that appeared to be eligible for cultivation. Any hope for crop production was thought to be preposterous. At this point, the area was deemed worthless, and discouragement of any hope for development by forthcoming settlers was inevitable.

Purchase of public land in what is now called Oxford was in 1823 by a man named Elbridge G. Deming. Soon after, the first person to settle in Oxford was a wolf trapper named Avery Brown. He made use of the land and gave some credibility to its value. It wasn&#x27;t long after that the first area post office was officially established in what was then known as Demingsburgh on May 2, 1834. Five years later, the name was officially changed to Oxford on January 15, 1839. Elbridge D. Deming was the first postmaster for Oxford, as the post office was located in his log home near the intersection of M-24 and Metamora Road.

On November 30, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at Oxford High School. Four people were killed, and seven others were injured, including an injured teacher. School attendance was very low that day, as rumors had spread earlier that week of a shooting being about to occur. Most of the students escaped into a nearby Meijer. The suspect, a 15-year-old sophomore student, reportedly fired between 15 and 20 bullets in a chemistry room and did not resist arrest.

<text>Oxford Township, officially the Charter Township of Oxford, is a charter township in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 22,419 at the 2020 census.

==Communities==
*The village of Oxford is located within the township. Like all villages in Michigan, it is geographically and politically part of the township, and residents pay both village and township taxes.
The Township has three unincorporated communities:
*Oakwood straddles the western border with Brandon Township at Baldwin and Oakwood Roads ( Elevation: 1099 ft./335 m.).
*Thomas is located at the north end of the Township at M-24 and Thomas Road ( Elevation: 1086 ft./331 m.). A railroad station and facilities were necessary near the northern edge of the township, and so the second community, Thomas, was developed. The place was platted by John Thomas in 1871.
*Waterstone is located on Granger Road/Market Street between Dunlap and M-24 ( Elevation: 1040 ft./317 M).

== History ==
Prior to the 1820s, what is now Oxford Township was known to be a hunting ground of the Nepessing Tribe of the Chippewa Indians, who inhabited large areas of what became Oakland, Lapeer, and St. Clair counties. Between 1810 and the early 1820s, numerous settlers visited the Oxford area, primarily to hunt and trap. The first documented sale of public land in this area was recorded in 1823 to Elbridge Deming, who later built a log cabin on land in section 9 (in the area of M-24 and Metamora Road) of the township, around the spring of 1832.

Oxford Township was not officially created until after Michigan became a state in 1837. It was originally part of Oakland Township, as were Addison Township and Orion Township; Oxford Township was split away and separately organized in 1837. The 1830s saw an influx of settlers to the area, originally known as Demingsburgh, Demings Corners, and Oxford Corners, before becoming known as Oxford in 1836. The family names of many early settlers to the area are evident today in names of streets and buildings, such as Powell, Hovey, Burdick, and Axford.

New residents continued the trek to Oxford Township, many settling in sections 22 and 27 of what was to become the village of Oxford in 1876. Along with residents came commerce and industry. A downtown area was built in the village, but much of the area south of Burdick Street and west of Washington Street burned to the ground in 1878. When rebuilt, most of the buildings were of brick and masonry construction and are still in use today. The 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s found Oxford a prospering commercial center, with such businesses as Oxford Carriage Factory, Oxford Machine Works, Oxford Valley Mills, Oxford Brewery and several furniture and cabinetry shops.

In addition to the village of Oxford, two other smaller communities developed in other areas of the township. The first developed near Baldwin and Oakwood roads, on the boundary with Brandon Township; the community of Oakwood reached a population of nearly 200 people by 1876 with a foundry and &quot;the usual shops and stores&quot;.

A railroad station and facilities were necessary near the northern edge of the township, and so the second community, Thomas, was developed. The place was platted by John Thomas in 1871. Thomas had a store, hotel, grain elevator and gristmill by the late 1870s.

Thomas and Oakwood continued to prosper until May 1896, when they were largely devastated by a monster tornado which traveled across the entire north end of Oakland County. The tornado killed 41 people and injured 46 others in northern Oakland and southern Lapeer counties. Seventeen of the fatalities were in the northern portion of Oxford Township, from the Oakwood village area to Thomas. While many of the homes in Oakwood and Thomas were rebuilt, the two communities were never again centers of commerce. Railroads were largely responsible for change and continued growth in the Oxford area. No longer isolated from Detroit, and now joined with communities to the north, Oxford&#x27;s commerce thrived. In addition to its businesses and factories, agriculture was a mainstay for the community. At one time in the 1880s, Oxford earned the nickname, Bagatown, from the large number of rutabagas shipped out by train.

The early 1880s saw a second railroad constructed from the Pontiac area, through Oxford to Port Austin. Known as the Pontiac, Oxford, and Port Austin Railroad, the &quot;P.O. and P.A.&quot;, it later became the Pontiac, Oxford, and Northern (the &quot;P.O. and N.&quot;), and finally the Grand Trunk Western Railroad. With the expansion of the second rail line through town, it now became possible to travel to the tip of Michigan&#x27;s thumb in one day. By 1900, a third, all electric powered passenger rail line known as the Detroit United Railway (D.U.R.) was extended through Oxford from Detroit to Flint and was noted for maintaining limited cars daily, both north and southbound. Over the years, the D.U.R. was involved in many collisions with automobiles, often resulting in death or injury to those whose automobiles tangled with the interurban cars at grade crossings. As automobile transportation became more reliable and roads improved, a growing percentage of the populace chose to travel by these means, forcing the demise of the D.U.R. in 1931.

On November 30, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at Oxford High School. Four students were killed, and eight other people were injured. The suspected shooter is a 15-year-old sophomore student who was taken into custody. His parents were charged on December 3 with involuntary manslaughter for failing to secure the handgun used in the shooting.

<doc id="118785" wikidata="Q2604810" url="?curid=118785" title="Pleasant Ridge, Michigan">
<text>Pleasant Ridge is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit on the Woodward Corridor, Pleasant Ridge is located roughly northwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 2,627.

With a land area of , Pleasant Ridge is the fifth-smallest city by land area in the state of Michigan after the cities of Sylvan Lake, Keego Harbor, Petersburg, and Clarkston.

==History==
Pleasant Ridge began when Burt Taylor subdivided the Mayday farm in 1913. The community incorporated as a village within Royal Oak Township in 1921 and again as an autonomous city in 1927. The origin of the name is believed to derive from the main thoroughfare of Ridge Road.

One of the more notable establishments within the city was Hedge&#x27;s Wigwam, which was a Native American-themed restaurant that operated from 1927 until 1967.

Pleasant Ridge was actively involved in resisting the construction of the middle segment of Interstate 696 in the early 1960s.

===Same-sex households===

Pleasant Ridge is bordered on the south by the city of Ferndale, which is considered the center of the LGBT community in the Metro Detroit region. The city of Pleasant Ridge is among the top cities in the nation with same-sex couple households, with at least 60 per 1,000 according to figures from the United States Census Bureau. A study by the Williams Institute from the University of California, Los Angeles recorded 59.55 same-sex couples for every 1,000 households in the city of Pleasant Ridge, while the state as a whole ranked low with only 5.6 for every 1,000 households. However, the study did not record the number of homosexual residents, only the number of same-sex households. The study listed Pleasant Ridge as having the highest same-sex household ratio in the state, ahead of Ferndale with 35.0 same-sex couples for every 1,000 households.

These numbers rank Pleasant Ridge as having the seventh-highest same-sex household ratio in the nation. Cities in the nation with a higher ratio include Provincetown, Massachusetts; Wilton Manors, Florida; Palm Springs, California; Rehoboth Beach, Delaware; Guerneville, California; and West Hollywood, California.

<doc id="118786" wikidata="Q847596" url="?curid=118786" title="Pontiac, Michigan">
<text>Pontiac ( &quot;&quot;) is a city in and the county seat of Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located roughly northwest of downtown Detroit, Pontiac is part of the Detroit metropolitan area, and is variously described as a satellite city or suburb of Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 61,606.

Founded in 1818, Pontiac was the second European-American organized settlement in Michigan near Detroit, after Dearborn. It was named after Pontiac, a war chief of the Ottawa Tribe, who occupied the area before the European settlers. The city was best known for its General Motors automobile manufacturing plants of the 20th century, which were the basis of its economy and contributed to the wealth of the region. These included Fisher Body, Pontiac East Assembly (a.k.a. Truck &amp; Coach/Bus), which manufactured GMC products, and the Pontiac Motor Division. In the city&#x27;s heyday, it was the site of the primary automobile assembly plant for the production of the famed Pontiac cars, a brand that was named after the city. The Pontiac brand itself was discontinued in 2010 by General Motors. The City of Pontiac also was home to Oakland Motor Car Company, which was acquired by General Motors in 1909.

In 1975, the city built the Pontiac Silverdome, the stadium that hosted the Detroit Lions of the National Football League from 1975 to 2001, when the team returned to Downtown Detroit at Ford Field. Super Bowl XVI was played at the Silverdome in 1982. After 2001, the stadium continued to be used for concerts and other events until it was demolished in 2018. It is now the site of an Amazon Fulfillment and Distribution facility.

== History ==

Present-day Pontiac, Michigan was traversed for thousands of years by indigenous peoples due to the confluence of the Saginaw Trail and the Nottawassippi River; the river&#x27;s indigenous name was replaced with the Clinton River name by settlers coming from New York State where DeWitt Clinton served as Governor. The Saginaw Trail was an important land trail route for indigenous peoples that ran from the Saginaw Bay in Michigan to the Detroit River in present-day Detroit.

Early European expeditions into the land north of Detroit described the area as having &quot;extreme sterility and barrenness&quot;. Developments and exploration were soon to prove that report false.

The first European-American settlers arrived in what is now the city of Pontiac in 1818. They followed the Saginaw Trail north from Detroit and determined the settlement should be where the trail and the river crossed. Two years later the fledgling settlement was designated as the county seat for Oakland County, due in part to the Michigan Territorial Governor Lewis Cass being receptive to the lobbying of The Pontiac Company&#x27;s members that their recently acquired property was ideal for the county seat location.

The Pontiac Company, consisting of 15 members and chaired by Solomon Sibley of Detroit, comprised the first landowners in Pontiac. Sibley, along with Stephen Mack and Shubael Conant, Pontiac Company members, also formed the partnership Mack, Conant &amp; Sibley to develop a town. Solomon and his wife Sarah Sibley largely financed construction of the first buildings. While Solomon was the first chair of the Pontiac Company, for two years Sarah Sibley was the most active as the go-between with settlers at Pontiac. Solomon Sibley was constantly traveling as a Territorial Congressman and later a Territorial Supreme Court judge. The Sibley-Hoyt house, thought to be one of the first structures in Pontiac, is preserved by its private owner.

In the 1820s Elizabeth Denison, an unmarried, free black woman, worked for the Sibleys. They helped her buy land in Pontiac in 1825. Stephen Mack, agent for the Pontiac Company, signed the deed at the request of the Sibleys, conveying 48.5 acres to Elizabeth Denison. She is believed to be the first black woman to purchase land in the new territory of Michigan.

In 1837 Pontiac became a village, the same year that Michigan gained statehood. The town had been named after the noted Ottawa Indian war chief who had his headquarters in the area decades before, during the resistance to European-American encroachment. Founded on the Clinton River, Pontiac was Michigan&#x27;s first inland settlement. Rivers were critical to settlements as transportation ways, in addition to providing water and, later, power.

The village was incorporated by the legislature as a city in 1861. From the beginning, Pontiac&#x27;s central location served it well. It attracted professional people, including doctors and lawyers, and soon became a center of industry. Woolen and grist mills made use of the Clinton River as a power source.

Abundant natural resources led to the establishment of several carriage manufacturing companies, all of which were thriving at the turn of the 20th century. One of the largest carriage manufacturing companies in Pontiac of that era was the O.J. Beaudette Wagon Works, which made bodies for carriages and then transitioned to manufacturing bodies for automobiles. At that time, the first self-propelled vehicles were introduced. Pontiac quickly became a capital of the new automotive industry.

Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pontiac had tremendous growth in its population and size as tens of thousands of prospective autoworkers moved here from the South to work in its GM auto assembly plants at Pontiac Assembly. African Americans came in the Great Migration, seeking work, education, and the chance to vote and escape the oppression of Jim Crow in the South.

As the small &quot;horseless carriage&quot; manufacturers became consolidated under the mantle of the General Motors Corporation, Pontiac grew as the industry grew. It also suffered the same setbacks as other cities during the Great Depression years of the 1930s. The buildup of the defense industry and conversion of the automotive industry to war demands increased the need for labor. Pontiac was a pivotal concentration of wartime production for the United States in World War II. Among many other vehicles and weapons, Pontiac facilities produced thousands of GMC trucks, Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns, naval torpedoes, tank axles, amphibious vehicles, and munitions.

The first postwar years after World War II were a time of prosperity, and continued migration of African Americans to the city in the second wave of the Great Migration, but the city changed as suburbs were developed and people commuted by car to work. The more established residents moved out to buy newer housing being built in the suburbs, draining off business and resulting in vacancies downtown. Racist policies and racial animus toward the growing African American population was also an important factor, and until the mid-1960s with the enactment of Fair Housing ordinances, most of the properties in Pontiac neighborhoods contained racially restrictive covenants in the deeds.

In order to prevent flooding, Pontiac confined the Clinton River in concrete through the downtown in 1963. Changing ideas about urban living in the early 21st century prompted the city to study uncovering the river to create a waterfront community in the city.

In late 1966, Pontiac-born real estate developer A. Alfred Taubman tried to build a large-scale shopping mall on vacant downtown land (where the Phoenix Center now stands). It was unsuccessful. Pontiac resident C. Don Davidson and his University of Detroit architectural class created a more comprehensive plan for development to benefit the city and the entire region around it. In 1969, the city of Pontiac adopted the Pontiac Plan as the official plan for rebuilding the vacant area of the downtown district.

In 1965, Davidson overheard news that the Detroit Lions were seeking a new football stadium in Southeast Michigan. Professor Davidson and city leaders made a push to develop a new multi-purpose stadium, which was built and became known as the Silverdome. Construction began on the 80,000-seat stadium in 1972 and it opened in 1975 as the Pontiac Metropolitan Stadium.

This was a part of Davidson&#x27;s vision for Pontiac. Besides becoming the new home stadium of the NFL&#x27;s Detroit Lions, NBA&#x27;s Detroit Pistons and USFL&#x27;s Michigan Panthers, the arena hosted such events as the 1979 NBA All-Star Game, the 1982 Super Bowl XVI game between the San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals, and four matches of soccer&#x27;s 1994 World Cup.

In 1968 there was an outbreak of a flu-like disease called Pontiac fever. After the discovery of the bacterium Legionella pneumophila in 1976 in Philadelphia, blood specimens from 1968 were re-examined and the same bacterium was found.

On August 30, 1971, ten school buses were destroyed in a bombing during white resistance to a federal court order to desegregate the city&#x27;s public schools.

Construction began in the 1970s on an urban renewal project known as the &quot;Pontiac Plan&quot;. The initial phase of this plan included the Phoenix Center, three office buildings, a transportation center, and a high-rise residential complex. The remainder of the plan was never completed. The city has struggled with declining population since 1980, due to industrial restructuring and the loss of jobs, especially in the automotive industry.

===Emergency financial manager===
From 2009 through 2013, Pontiac was under the oversight of an Emergency Financial Manager appointed by the state government. The Emergency Manager was authorized to make day-to-day executive and financial municipal decisions. The position was not subject to the usual checks and balances, nor to election. The first and second managers, Fred Leeb and Michael Stampfler, were appointed by Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm. The third manager was Louis Schimmel, who was appointed by Governor Rick Snyder.

In order to balance the budget, state-appointed emergency managers drastically revised labor union contracts with the city, sold off city assets such as parking meters, and privatized most public services. The Oakland County Sheriff&#x27;s Office handles all police (saving $2 million a year) and nearby Waterford township has responsibility for fire protection (saving $3 million). Pontiac sold its water treatment plant for $55 million, and outsources garbage collection, animal control, vital records and street maintenance. Many people working in City Hall are employed by contractors. The city payroll has declined from 600 to 50 employees. The Silverdome Stadium, once valued at $22 million, was sold for $583,000 (it would end up being demolished in December 2017). The emergency managers reduced the city&#x27;s annual spending to $36 million from $57 million, and erased almost all of its long-term debt.

In August 2013, Schimmel resigned as Emergency Financial Manager. Schimmel now serves as part of the four-member Transition Advisory Board for the city. Other members of the board include Deputy Oakland County Executive Bob Daddow, Rochester Hills Finance Director Keith Sawdon, and Ed Karyzno, administrator of the Michigan Department of Treasury&#x27;s Office of Financial Responsibility.

In July 2012, Mayor Leon Jukowski and Emergency Financial Manager Louis Schimmel announced plans to demolish the Phoenix Center. Its vacancy rates were high, and the city did not want to continue the high maintenance costs. New thinking about downtown was to re-emphasize the street grid; the city wanted to reconnect Saginaw Street to the downtown area. Owners of the connecting Ottawa Towers filed an injunction, claiming the demolition would devalue their property and result in lost parking. In December 2012, a judge granted an injunction for the Ottawa Towers on an &quot;expedited calendar&quot;, which prevented the demolition of the Phoenix Center for the time being.

In 2010, city leaders and business owners had launched &quot;The Rise of The Phoenix&quot; initiative. This plan was intended to attract businesses interested in downtown retail space. The applicants selected would be given free rent in exchange for multi-year leases (two years or more) as well as one year of free parking in city lots. Some 52 new businesses were recruited to locate in downtown Pontiac, bringing new life to the city. Plans for the development of mixed-use and loft flats in downtown were announced in September 2011 by the Michigan Economic Growth Authority (MEGA). MEGA estimates the development could generate $20.4 million in new investment and create up to 107 permanent full-time jobs in downtown. The development was to be supported by a state tax break.

On January 26, 2012, West Construction Services began the renovation and restoration of the former Sears building for the Lafayette Place Lofts, the largest construction investment in Downtown Pontiac in approximately 30 years. The project is a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified residential and commercial mixed-use development: it will have 46 new urban rental lofts, a fresh food grocery store and café, and a fitness center. Construction was completed during 2012, and the lofts and market opened in December of that year. 10 West Lofts, another development in the area, will bring more residents to downtown Pontiac.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.58%) is water.

Pontiac is bounded by the city of Auburn Hills to the east and north, the city of Lake Angelus to the north, Waterford Township to the west, and Bloomfield Township to the south.

The former Pontiac Township included what are now the cities of Pontiac, Lake Angelus, and Auburn Hills. The last remaining portion of the township incorporated as the city of Auburn Hills in 1983. Although the township no longer exists as a civil entity, it is still used as a survey township for land use purposes.

In 2010, the festival was moved to nearby Royal Oak. The First Annual Scheme Cruise was held September 6, 2015, an event sponsored by the Scheme Street Battle League. The event combined rap battles, basketball competitions, and a car show. Pontiac officials are considering relocating the event to the downtown area of the city.

The city is at the north end of the famous Woodward Avenue, which extends as a major boulevard into Detroit. It was originally lined with mansions and prestigious businesses. In the 1950s and 1960s it was popular with young people who would &quot;cruise&quot; and drag-race their hot-rods in the area. Pontiac participates in the annual Woodward Dream Cruise, an event celebrating Woodward&#x27;s hot-rod history, with a parade of cars stretching from Detroit to Pontiac.

The city hosts two nationally renowned haunted houses: The Realm of Darkness and Erebus. The Realm of Darkness has in previous years been chosen as America&#x27;s Best Haunted House. Erebus held the world record from 2005 to 2009 for &quot;Largest Haunted House&quot;; it is 4 stories high.

Pontiac was an early location of movie making, with the Raleigh Michigan Studios, renamed as the Motown Motion Picture Studios. Scenes of the 2012 remake of the film &quot;Red Dawn&quot; were filmed in Pontiac and other Michigan locations, recreating Spokane, Washington. Additionally, downtown Pontiac in August 2012 was the filming site for the tornado-themed disaster movie &quot;Into the Storm&quot;. The 2013 fantasy adventure film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; was filmed at Motown Motion Picture Studios. &quot;&quot; is the latest movie to be filmed within the studio, with the bulk of filming taking place in Pontiac.

Pontiac is home to the Michigan Fallen Heroes Memorial. It is located within the Oakland County Government Complex off Telegraph Road.

The Pontiac mayor also is responsible for appointing several positions in office including deputy mayor as well as overseeing the law, financial, police, and fire departments.

==== Mayoral history ====
Wallace E. Holland (1974–1986 and 1990–1994) was the first African American elected as Mayor of Pontiac, and the first directly elected Mayor following the adoption of the revised Pontiac City Charter in 1982.

Deirdre Holloway Waterman, was an ophthalmologist who was elected as Pontiac&#x27;s first female mayor by more than 68% of the vote on November 5, 2013. She was re-elected in 2017 with 57% of the vote. Her late husband, William Waterman, was a prominent attorney in the community who was appointed in 1988 by Michigan Governor James Blanchard to the District Court in Pontiac and elected multiple times to continue serving; he died in office in 2003. The District Courthouse was renamed in his honor, the William J. Waterman Hall of Justice. Then-incumbent Mayor Deirdre Waterman was removed from the August primary ballot due to unresolved campaign finance violations, but continued as a write-in candidate in the primary election. She was not successful in that effort.

In November 2021, Tim Greimel, who previously served as a Michigan State Representative and Oakland County Commissioner in districts that included Pontiac, was elected Mayor in the general election. He won with 61.66% of votes, while his general election opponent Alexandria T. Riley received 37.50% of the vote. Riley, a frequent candidate for office in Pontiac, previously served as a city employee under Mayor Deirdre Waterman and more recent worked for the Genesee County Land Bank Authority.

<text>Rochester is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 12,711 at the 2010 census. It is a northern suburb in Metro Detroit located 20 miles north of the city of Detroit.

Rochester was the first European settlement in Oakland County when it was founded in 1818. It became part of the Avon Township in 1835 and incorporated as an autonomous city in 1967. It is mostly surrounded by the city of Rochester Hills and also borders Shelby Township to the east.

==Communities and boroughs==
The city has the following neighborhoods:
*Stony Creek is a neighborhood on the northeast end of the city on the border with Rochester Hills.
*The Bluffs is a neighborhood on the southeast corner of the city on the border with Rochester Hills.
*Yates is shared with Shelby Charter Township, Macomb County and Rochester Hills.

==History==
The Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi and Wyandot peoples all resided in the Rochester area. All of them ceded land claims by the early 19th century. The first settlers in what would become Rochester, the Graham family, built a log cabin in 1817. The cabin was located on present-day 3rd St., just west of Main. The city was named for Rochester, New York, just like Rochester, Minnesota, as many early settlers to the area were formerly from the state of New York. 
The city became an industrial center with abundant water power from the Clinton River and Paint Creek. The interconnected waterways are no longer used for travel or local industry, but provide natural beauty, some fishing, and a healthy portion of the Clinton Watershed. Historically, past industries formerly located in Rochester included a refinery for sugar beets, a paper products company, and the Western Knitting Mills factory, which was later adapted and utilized during World War II for incendiary production—businesses that no longer exist in the area. Rochester was served by two railroads as well as the Detroit United Railway, an interurban to Royal Oak and Detroit.

Chapman Mill Pond, east of downtown, disappeared into the Paint Creek when the dam broke during the flood of 1946. The reclaimed land is the site of the current post office, Rochester Hills library, and Olde Towne Road. Water Street, formerly situated at the edge of the large pond, remains by its name a reminder of the pond&#x27;s former existence.

Michigan became the 26th state in 1837, and the Village of Rochester was formed on April 12, 1869, within the boundaries of Avon Township. By 1895, Rochester&#x27;s population was 900. The village became the city of Rochester in 1967, breaking away from Avon Township. Avon Township became the City of Rochester Hills in 1984, following a long court battle, where the city of Rochester annexed of Avon Township&#x27;s land. It more than doubled the city of Rochester&#x27;s size.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Since an annexation of a section of Avon Township (now Rochester Hills), the city has an eastern boundary that extends to the border with Macomb County.

== Government ==

The city of Rochester is governed by a seven-member city council and its mayor. City policy is then administered by a full-time city manager. The government provides full city services, including police, fire and water/sewer services, similar to many other communities in north Oakland County.

The city contracts with neighboring Rochester Hills for public library services for the city&#x27;s residents.

=== Federal, state, and county legislators ===

==Culture==
The city has held the annual &quot;Rochester Hometown Christmas Parade&quot; since 1951. Held on the first Sunday in December, it features over 100 units. It claims to be Michigan&#x27;s largest Christmas parade.

In 2006, the city had its first &quot;Big Bright Light Show&quot; for the Christmas season. The downtown businesses were covered in 500,000 individual lights. An expansion of the program after its initial inception expanded that coverage to a reported one million lights. It was also aired by WXYZ-TV.

===Architecture===

Established in 1817, Rochester was one of Oakland County&#x27;s first settlements. Twenty-two buildings on Main Street are more than 50 years old, and several are on the State Register of Historic Places.
* Rollin Sprague Building – The oldest commercial building in the downtown is the Rollin Sprague building, built in 1849 of coursed cobblestone. Since 1930 it has housed &quot;The Home Bakery&quot;.
* Opera House – The Opera House Building opened on November 8, 1890, as the social and cultural center of town. It featured movies, lectures, dances, commencements and other events until 1933. Ironically, an opera was never performed in the Opera House. Refurbished in 1987, it currently houses the Lytle Pharmacy.
* Rochester Grain Elevator – Located at the corner of University Drive and Water Street is the Rochester Grain Elevator (originally named Griggs Grain Elevator), in the form of a red barn, and built in 1880. Until the 1970s, farmers brought their grain to the elevator to be shipped to Detroit. After that time, its primary use has been as a supply store. An external restoration in the summer of 2009 worked toward returning the building to its former appearance.

*Royal Park Hotel – In September 2004, the Royal Park Hotel, a four-diamond luxury boutique hotel, designed by Victor Saroki opened in downtown Rochester. It cost $43 million to build. Several celebrities have stayed there, including Paul McCartney, Hugh Hefner, and former President George W. Bush (while seeking re-election).
* Western Knitting Mills – The Western Knitting Mills, a large brick building on Water Street, was built in 1896. At one time, its annual output of 100,000 dozen pairs of gloves made it one of the largest glove producers in the world. Today the mill is fully restored, and home to The Rochester Mills brewery restaurant, as well as several other businesses.
*RCS Administration Center is the former Rochester High School, at one point in its past serving kindergarten through graduating senior students. Built in 1889 but renovated at different times in its history, it opened as Rochester School (Avon #5), replacing an earlier school on that same site that had burned down in 1888. The property has been used for school purposes since 1847. Since the mid-1970s, the building has housed the Rochester Community Schools Board of Education offices and occasional related events, and is certainly one of the largest and noteworthy structures in the city.

===Parks and recreation===


* Paint Creek and Clinton River Trails – City is at the cross section of two major &quot;Rails-to-Trails&quot; projects: the Paint Creek Trail and Clinton River trail. These trails are used for recreational activities, like biking and walking. They connect to several major parks, including Bloomer Park, Rochester Municipal Park, Stoney Creek Metropark and the Dinosaur Hill Nature Preserve. The majority of the area used for the trails and pathways include former railroad and interurban rail lines, long since converted to non-vehicular recreational use.
* Paint Creek Center for the Arts – Paint Creek Center for the Arts is a regional non-profit art center dedicated to promoting the arts and artistic excellence through a full range of cultural programming including studio art classes for children and adults, exhibitions of emerging and established Michigan artists, outreach programs, community involvement and the annual Art &amp; Apples Festival.
* Rochester Avon Recreation Authority – The Rochester Avon Recreation Authority (RARA) has been a recreation provider to Rochester, Rochester Hills, and Oakland Township since 1946. It provides recreation programs from 12 months to adults in a variety of areas, such as dance, sports classes, sport leagues, pre-school classes, special events, fitness, skiing, etc.
*Rochester Municipal Park – Formerly called Avon Park, is the largest park area in the city, comprising a large portion of the downtown area. Linked with the Paint Creek trail system (and including a significant portion of the creek itself), it offers a quiet, naturalized setting, easily enjoyed from its own trail system, as well as two playground areas, lighted tennis courts, an outdoor music-stage amphitheater, the Rochester Community House, and the Kiwanis Pavilion. The &#x27;duck pond&#x27; has been used in past winters for skating. The public park is home to free annual events such as the Art &amp; Apples Festival, the Heritage Festival, and the summer concert series (Music In The Park).

==Economy==
Rochester has a vibrant downtown shopping district. The Farmer&#x27;s Market takes place every Saturday, May through October. It features fresh produce, flowers, handmade goods and other products from Michigan.

Several &quot;city festivals&quot; take place in downtown: MI Earthday Festival (on Earthday weekend), Dancing in the Streets (August), Music in the Park (Thursdays in summer), Art &amp; Apples Festival (weekend after Labor Day in September), and the Heritage Festival (Memorial Day Weekend), which includes two classic automobile shows. Other scheduled, traditional civic celebrations and activities include Girls&#x27; Night Out, the Gallery Walk, Lagniappe, the Sidewalk Sales, Movies In The Moonlight, and the two-day Fire And Ice Festival. The popular Rockin&#x27; Rods classic car show each August features hundreds of rare and unusual automobiles, both domestic and imported.

The Older Persons Commission provides social and educational activities, nutritional meals, senior resource services, as well as health and wellness programs to community members 50 years old and older.

<text>Rochester Hills is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit, Rochester Hills is located about north of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 76,300.

The area was first settled by European Americans in 1817, and organized as Avon Township in 1835. The City of Rochester incorporated in 1967, while the remaining area of Avon Township was incorporated and renamed the City of Rochester Hills in 1984. Considered a northern suburb of Metro Detroit, Rochester Hills is about north of Detroit.

==Communities==
*Stony Creek is a neighborhood on the northeast end of the city on the border with Rochester at .
*Yates is on the boundary with Rochester and Shelby Township, Oakland County ( ; Elevation: 669 ft./204 m.).

==History==
Prior to European settlement, the area now known as Rochester Hills was inhabited by Native Americans, namely the Potawatomi. The Potawatomi depended on the area&#x27;s abundant water sources, such as the Clinton River and Paint Creek, to grow crops, fish, and travel. They resided here until the 1807 Treaty of Detroit caused them, along with the Odawa, Wyandot, and Ojibwe peoples, to cede their land in Southeast Michigan.

The first European settler was James Graham who arrived in 1817. Graham and his family reached the area by following trails created by the Sauk Native Americans. Avon Township was organized in 1835. Rochester incorporated as a village within the township in 1869. The township adopted a charter in 1948 under the Home Rule Act. Also in 1948 a post office was established under the name of Brooklands for the area between Auburn Road and Hamlin Road just to the west of Dequindre Road.

In 1966, village residents voted to become the City of Rochester, effective in February 1967. As a result, Rochester residents no longer had to pay property taxes to the township, as it was now a separate municipality.

In 1967, Avon Township filed a petition to become a city. In January 1968, township voters approved the petition to move forward with seeking city status. Three proposed city charters were voted down by residents, the first in March 1969, the second in May 1970, and the third in September 1971. The city of Rochester then sought to annex all of the township, which was unanimously denied by the Michigan Boundary Commission. In 1972, petitions were filed to consolidate Avon Township and Rochester. In April 1974, the consolidation petition lost by 350 votes in the township, while passing by four votes in Rochester. In May 1974, Rochester&#x27;s petition to annex of Avon Township was approved by the Michigan Boundary Commission, depriving Avon Township of its largest taxpayer. The township became Avon Charter Township in August 1978. Court challenges to the 1974 annexation continued until November 1981, when the township was ordered to surrender the annexed property. An impending annexation request from the City of Troy, due south, for 300 acres of southeast Avon Township brought the city hood question to a crisis.

In May 1984, township voters approved a city charter. On November 20, 1984, Avon Township became the City of Rochester Hills. The name of the new city was put to a vote, with the other choice being &quot;Avon Hills.&quot; The name &quot;Rochester Hills&quot; won by a landslide with voters, based on the area&#x27;s historical ties to Rochester and the rolling hills in the area. Township Supervisor Earl E. Borden became the first mayor of Rochester Hills.

In June 2024, there was a mass shooting in the city.

<text>Royal Oak is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Royal Oak is located roughly north of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 58,211.

Royal Oak is located along the Woodward Corridor, and is served by Interstate 75 and Interstate 696. The city has one of the largest downtowns in Detroit&#x27;s suburbs, and is also home to much of the Detroit Zoo, with portions extending into neighboring Huntington Woods.

==History==
Royal Oak was named in 1819, during one of the surveying expeditions led by Territorial Governor Lewis Cass. A large oak tree at this small settlement reminded Cass of the story of the Royal Oak, where King Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland hid to escape capture by the Roundheads after the Battle of Worcester, so he chose that name for the settlement.

Royal Oak was not incorporated as a village until 1891. It was reincorporated a city in 1921.

===20th century to present===
Royal Oak developed as a suburb of Detroit in the early 20th century, following Detroit&#x27;s booming growth as a result of industrialization and its auto industry.

The Royal Oak Farmers Market opened as a truck market, at the corner of 4th and Troy streets, on October 14, 1925, as a cooperative venture between the then-new City of Royal Oak and Oakland County, Michigan. There were still numerous farmers in the county. The present structure, at the corner of 11 Mile Road and Troy Street, is adjacent to the 44th District Court. It was erected in the spring of 1927 and dedicated July 1 of that year.

In the 1920s, Father Charles Coughlin, a Canadian Catholic priest who relocated to Detroit, became the founding pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower, now a prominent landmark in the city. Through his ministry, he raised funds to build the present limestone church complex and tower. Initially he broadcast religious speeches from this site.

During the 1930s, his broadcasts became more political. He initially supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt, then opposed him and promoted the causes of the fascist leaders of Germany and Italy. The Roosevelt administration closed down his radio operation after the outbreak of World War II, with support from the Catholic hierarchy. Coughlin had developed national political influence and had an increasingly anti-semitic message, at a time when Jewish people were being severely persecuted in Germany.

In 1991, Thomas McIlvane, a postal worker, killed five people in Royal Oak&#x27;s post office, after being fired from the Postal Service for &quot;insubordination.&quot; This incident helped to popularize the term &quot;going postal.&quot;

The downtown originally had a typical mixture of small-scale retail and trade to serve the city of Royal Oak. With the development of the highway system in the postwar period, it lost business to suburban malls. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, Royal Oak&#x27;s downtown has developed as an entertainment and nightlife destination. A number of large condominiums and lofts have been built in the area, increasing the density of the downtown population. In 2022, the Royal Oak City Commission approved the demolition of the historic Main Art Theater, once a symbol of moviegoers in the area.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.08%) is water.

Royal Oak developed around a river, the Red Run. Vinsetta Boulevard was built skirting a source branch of the Red Run for its median. In the 1930s, Vinsetta&#x27;s entire median, along with the river and all but the tops of the bridges for the crossing streets were filled in as part of a WPA project during the Great Depression. During 1967–8, the rest of the river in Oakland County was buried within a six-foot drain pipe.

Extensive tree-planting has taken place since the 1930s, leading to the town being nicknamed &quot;The City of Trees&quot;, although recent increased developments have caused controversy about the maintenance of the city&#x27;s urban forest.

==Economy==
Royal Oak developed initially as a suburb after Detroit boomed as a major industrial city. Residents of Detroit began to move to the suburbs for newer housing, and to separate themselves from the rising tensions and riots in Detroit, in a process referred to as white flight. It had a compact, traditional street-side shopping district, which runs along Main Street and Washington Avenue downtown. During the 2000s, this area was redeveloped with numerous new businesses, and is now considered a trendy, upscale, urban-chic district, featuring restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. A number of mixed-use high-rise developments have been constructed — mostly condo &quot;lofts&quot; with retail and office space on the lower levels.

Points of interest include the Detroit Zoo, a major regional tourist attraction, the William Beaumont Hospital, the Royal Oak Music Theatre, the Baldwin Theatre, Mark Ridley&#x27;s Comedy Castle, a location of Emagine Entertainment, and shops, cafes, and restaurants.

The National Arbor Day Foundation has awarded Royal Oak the distinction of &quot;Tree City USA&quot; every year since 1976 as a result of the city&#x27;s commitment to tree planting and preservation.

On October 5, 2021, Citizens State Bank opened up their headquarters on Woodward Ave, making it the only bank to be headquartered in Royal Oak.

The Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program is a foundation set up by Detroit-area native Gilda Radner, who is known for her work as a comedian of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 1998 the Program created a free cancer support community for people with cancer, their families, and friends. Gilda&#x27;s Club Metro Detroit operates a three-story non-residential house in Royal Oak. It has served more than 3,000 members for social and emotional support through a variety of activities.

==Arts and culture==

Downtown Royal Oak features a wide assortment of nightlife venues, including the Royal Oak Music Theatre and the Baldwin Theatre. Mark Ridley&#x27;s Comedy Castle, a comedy club, was an early venue for performers such as Tim Allen and Dave Coulier. Allen&#x27;s connections to Royal Oak would later in his career be alluded to in the sitcom &quot;Home Improvement&quot; as the protagonist&#x27;s (played by Allen) place of residence.

Royal Oak encompasses a major span of the Woodward Dream Cruise. The city sponsors ancillary events around the Cruise. It is the site of the Detroit Zoo, one of the region&#x27;s leading tourist attractions.

In December 2009 it was announced that the Arts, Beats and Eats festival would be moved from Pontiac to Royal Oak.

Royal Oak is home to the Royal Oak Leprechauns, a collegiate summer league baseball team that competes in the Northwoods League. The Leprechauns play their home games at Memorial Park.

===Religion===
Previously Royal Oak had St. Dennis Catholic Church of the Detroit Archdiocese; in 2012 it began the process of merging into St. Vincent Ferrer Church in Madison Heights. The real estate was later redeveloped as a location of grocery store chain Kroger.

Royal Oak is home to the National Shrine of the Little Flower Basilica, which was declared a national shrine in 1998 by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Later in 2014, Pope Francis granted the National Shrine of the Little Flower the honorary title of ‘Minor Basilica’.

==Government==
Royal Oak has a Council–manager government. It is governed by a city commission consisting of a mayor and six commission members. The city commission appoints a city manager, who manages the day-to-day operations of the city.

==Education==
The city is served by Royal Oak Neighborhood Schools. Private K-12 education is also offered by Shrine of the Little Flower Catholic Church while nearby St. Mary&#x27;s offers K-8 instruction. A branch of Oakland Community College is located in the city and a new location of Baker College is nearing the end of construction.

A portion of land in the city is zoned to Berkley Public Schools.

In recent years Royal Oak has begun to consolidate its public schools in response to a decline in enrollment levels compared to the baby boom era. In 2006, the city&#x27;s two public high schools, George A. Dondero High School and Clarence M. Kimball High School, were combined into a new Royal Oak High School. Beginning in 2007, the city&#x27;s two middle schools were combined into one school, Royal Oak Middle School, in the former Dondero building. The number of elementary schools was reduced to six. Some parents protested the planned closure and demolition of Longfellow and Whittier elementary schools. They were seeking to have them considered for historic district recognition by way of signed petition. Despite their efforts, both schools and a number of other former elementary schools were demolished in the fall of 2007.

The Royal Oak school system gained brief notoriety for an incident following the Trump election. Some middle schoolers chanted &quot;build that wall&quot;. A student video of the incident was widely shared on Facebook, attracting more than 4 million views within 24 hours. A week later a noose was found in the 8th grade boys bathroom at the middle school. The student who had placed the noose in the bathroom was removed from the school shortly afterward.

St. Dennis School of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit was formerly in Royal Oak. It closed in 2011.

==Media==
In addition to &quot;The Detroit News&quot; and &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, regional newspapers serving all of southeast Michigan, the city is served by the &quot;Daily Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Oakland Press&quot;, the &quot;Royal Oak Review&quot;, and &quot;The Mirror&quot;.

An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Royal Oak Township borders Detroit to the north, roughly north of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the township had a population of 2,374. It is independent of the city of Royal Oak.

The township is the only remaining unincorporated portion of the original Royal Oak survey township, which was organized in 1833. With a present-day area of , Royal Oak Charter Township is the state&#x27;s smallest charter township by area and the second-smallest overall township in the state after Novi Township.

==History==
Royal Oak Township was established in 1833 as a regular, civil township, and at one time consisted of all or parts of the following modern cities: Hazel Park, Ferndale, Oak Park, Madison Heights, Pleasant Ridge, Huntington Woods, Royal Oak, Berkley, and Clawson. The township began to shrink beginning in 1921 with the incorporation of the cities above. To provide greater protection from easy annexation, the township incorporated as a charter township in 1972. Currently, the township has neither its own police department nor a post office. Its police department was disbanded in 1998.

===2003 and 2004 annexations===
From the incorporation of Madison Heights in 1955 to 2004, the township consisted of two small non-contiguous parts within Oakland County. The larger portion lies along Eight Mile Road, adjacent to the cities of Detroit, Oak Park, and Ferndale. A second portion, located to the northwest and bordering Oak Park and Southfield, was the subject of a series of annexations and conditional land transfers in 2003 &amp; 2004

Two property-initiated annexation elections in 2003 consisted of Crown Pointe Plaza office complex, Lincoln Towers Apartments, Biarritz Club/Rue Versailles Apartments, in which the township was estimated to have lost 20% of its property tax value to Oak Park. The property owners cited lower taxes in the city of Oak Park and poor relations with the township&#x27;s government as reasons for seeking annexation. Two additional property owners initiated an annexation to Oak Park in 2004, which involved the annexation of the Bridgewater Village Apartments and Lincoln Woods Apartments.

Lawsuits were filed by the township seeking to overturn these annexations; to make the transfer of the territory to the city more amicable and to end litigiation, Oak Park initiated talks with the township on a 425 Agreement in September 2004, which allows the transfer of territory conditioned on the sharing of taxes generated from the transferred territory. The 425 agreement, which was to run 35 years and covered all previously annexed areas of the township—except Bridgewater Village Apartments—plus the remaining unannexed areas of the township, was agreed upon by the city and township in October. It came into effect on November 1, 2004, the day preceding the election to annex Bridgewater Village and Lincoln Woods Apartments, fully completing the transfer of the northwest part of the township to Oak Park, and ending litigation from the township against the city. Oak Park amended the 425 Agreement on January 16, 2006, to bring in Bridgewater Village Apartments after resolving litigiation with the property owner concerning taxes and the associated costs of annexation.

<text>Southfield is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Southfield borders Detroit to the north, roughly northwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 76,618.

Southfield is notable as the home of multiple business districts, including the Southfield City Centre (an edge city which contains the tallest building in Detroit&#x27;s suburbs) and the area surrounding the former Northland Center shopping mall. It is also home to Lawrence Technological University. The city was originally part of Southfield Township before incorporating in 1958. The autonomous city of Lathrup Village is an enclave within Southfield.

==History==
Southfield was surveyed in 1817 according to the plan by Michigan territorial governor Lewis Cass. The first settlers came from nearby Birmingham and Royal Oak, Michigan, as well as New York and Vermont. The area that became Southfield was settled by John Daniels in 1823. Among the founders were the Heth, Stephens, Harmon, McClelland and Thompson families.

Town 1 north, 10 east was first organized as Ossewa Township on July 12, 1830, but the name was changed to Southfield Township 17 days later. The township took its name from its location in the &quot;south fields&quot; of Bloomfield Township. A US post office was established in 1833 and the first town hall built in 1873.
The Southfield Fire Department was formed on April 6, 1942, and the Southfield Police Department in 1953. In the 1950s, cities and villages began to incorporate within the township, including Lathrup Village in 1950, and Beverly Hills in 1957. Most of what was left of the township was formally incorporated as a city on April 28, 1958, to protect it from annexation attempts by Detroit; whites who had migrated to the suburbs did not want to be associated with Detroit&#x27;s expanding black community.

City Hall was built in 1964 as part of the new Civic Center complex, which also became home to Southfield&#x27;s police headquarters. The Civic Center was expanded in 1971 to include a sports arena with swimming pool. Evergreen Hills Golf Course was added in 1972, and in 1978, a new public safety building, the Southfield Pavilion, and a new court building were added. In 2003, an expanded and redesigned Southfield Public Library opened to the public on the Civic Center grounds, featuring state-of-the-art facilities. Outside the Civic Center complex, Southfield has municipal parks and recreation facilities, largely developed in the 1970s, including Beech Woods Recreation Center and John Grace Community Center.

Duns Scotus College is now the home of Word of Faith Christian Center. In 2016, the site was the center of local controversy over a proposed oil drilling site. Due to sustained opposition and environmental concerns, the plan was cancelled.

Southfield is also home to the Detroit area&#x27;s Consulate-General of Iraq.

==== Jewish Americans ====

Since the rapid suburbanization of the 1950s and 1960s, many Jewish Americans from Northwest Detroit (particularly the Dexter-Davison neighborhood) moved to Southfield and other inner-ring suburbs such as Oak Park and Huntington Woods. Congregation Shaarey Zedek moved from Detroit to Southfield in 1962 to a modernist synagogue building designed by Percival Goodman. The city was also previously home to Congregation Beth Achim on 12 Mile Road until its merger with Congregation Adat Shalom. The building was later purchased and demolished by a Jewish day school. Though much of the Conservative and Reform Jewish population has since spread out to suburbs such as West Bloomfield and Farmington Hills, the city maintains a thriving Orthodox Jewish and Lubavitch community. It is also home to Farber Hebrew Day School – Yeshivat Akiva, a kosher grocery store, and many independent synagogues.

<text>Springfield Charter Township is a charter township of Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 14,703. The township was named for the numerous springs in the area.

==Communities==
The Township has no incorporated villages and five unincorporated communities within:
*Andersonville, first known as the &quot;Husted Settlement&quot; after the Hustead family who moved there in 1833, is at around the junction of Andersonville and Big Lake roads. It became known as the &quot;Anderson Settlement&quot; after the Anderson family purchased and settled there in 1836. A post office named &quot;Andersonville&quot; was established in 1895, which operated until 1912. It was a station on the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway. The same track is still in use by Canadian National for freight service.
*Austin Corners located on the northern boundary of the township with Groveland Township.
*Davisburg is located at , around the junction of Davisburg and Andersonville roads. The Davisburg ZIP code of 48350 serves most of Springfield Township. The location was named for Cornelius Davis, who moved there in 1836, and with his sons platted a village in 1857. A post office was established in 1855, and &quot;Davisburg&quot; still serves as the mailing address for a majority of addresses within the township. Davisburg was a named station on the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway passenger service. The same track is still in use by Canadian National for freight service.
*Jossman Acres is located at Clarridge and Cherrywood roads ( (Elevation: 1066 ft./325 m.). 
*Springfield is located at around the junction of Bridge Lake Road and Dixie Highway. Daniel LeRoy made the first land purchase in the township, in June 1830. Ashael Fuller settled on LeRoy&#x27;s land and later purchased much of it. Fuller opened a hotel on the Detroit-Saginaw stagecoach line. A post office opened in 1832 and operated until 1888. Several lots were platted in 1840.

==History==

Springfield Township was established by the Michigan Legislature on March 2, 1836. Civil government was first organized April 3, 1837. Springfield, one of the first settlements in the area, began with a hotel along the Detroit and Saginaw Turnpike, now known as Dixie Highway. Andersonville, located at the intersection of Andersonville Road and Big Lake Road, was settled shortly thereafter in 1833, followed three years later by the hamlet of Davisburg. Springfield Township transitioned from a General Law Township to a Charter Township under Michigan&#x27;s Charter Township Act on April 1, 1986.

The Detroit and Milwaukee Railway (now part of the Canadian National Railway) was built in 1856, and two stations were in the township, in Andersonville and Davisburg. The railroad provided a major impetus to growth. Agriculture was the mainstay of the local economy and trains allowed the farmers to ship produce and live stock to market and to receive supplies and equipment. By 1860 Springfield Township&#x27;s population was 1,425.

In 1924, Dixie Highway was paved from Pontiac to Flint. With the decline of agriculture as a major economic activity in the township, residents began commuting to Pontiac and Flint for employment in the developing automotive factories, marking the beginning of the township&#x27;s decline. By 1930, Springfield Township&#x27;s population had fallen to 923. The township&#x27;s decline would unexpectedly be reversed in the 1960s with the construction of Interstate 75. The accessibility provided by two interchanges accelerated residential growth in the late 1960s and 1970s. Population improved, going from 1,825 in 1950 to 2,664 in 1960, 4,388 in 1970, 6,502 in 1976, and 8,295 in 1980.

Springfield Township has had a long-standing commitment to zoning and planning dating back to the early 1950s. The Township Board adopted an interim zoning ordinance in early 1952, which contained five zoning districts. In 1965 an ordinance which contained 13 different zoning districts was adopted. Planning and zoning functions were coordinated with the adoption of the township&#x27;s first Master Plan in 1972 and subsequently the adoption of an entirely new zoning ordinance the following year. The 1973 ordinance serves as a basis for the current zoning ordinance.

Out of concern for the residential growth during the 1970s and its effects on the entire township, the Planning Commission embarked on a comprehensive review of the Master Plan and the Zoning Map in the early 1980s. As a result, the revised Master Plan and Zoning Ordinance incorporated natural resource protection information and standards. This slowed the growth of Springfield Township during the decade, growing to 9,927 in 1990. Additional comprehensive reviews and updates were done in the early 1990s and again in 2002. The primary basis for the township&#x27;s planning, zoning, and land use decisions for at least the last 20 years has been the protection and preservation of their abundant and very special natural resources.

Today, Springfield Township is home to many parks, including Springfield Oaks County Park, site of the annual Oakland County Fair, and Indian Springs Metropark. The township is also home to several churches, a few schools including Springfield Christian Academy (the township&#x27;s only high school) and a handful of shopping areas. The township&#x27;s population, which increased by a third in the 1990s, continued to grow through the first decade of the 21st century.

Springfield Township also houses a former Superfund site, The Springfield Township Dump.

Springfield Township is a member of the Clarkston Area Chamber of Commerce and Holly Chamber of Commerce.

==History==
The earliest recorded purchases of land in what was known as Troy Township occurred in 1819. A couple of years later, a settlement known as Troy Corners was established due to Johnson Niles buying 160 acres in the region. The area is currently the north-central area of Troy. In 1827 Troy Township was established. In 1955, Troy was officially incorporated primarily as a strategy for preventing border cities from taking more land. This also helped to establish more robust city services for Troy residents, whose numbers increased rapidly during this time due to Detroiters fleeing the city for the surrounding suburbs.

It was named after Troy, New York and the ancient city of Troy as many of the early settlers, as in much of Michigan, originated from New York.

The town&#x27;s name is said to have been given by the first American settler, Walter Hewitt, in 1825. Upon his arrival, he noticed what appeared to be a stone wall along the western bank of a nearby lake, possibly constructed by earlier Potawatomi Indian tribes.

Walled Lake was a village inhabited by Ojibwa and Potowatamie people until about 1830. It appears that these people had relocated from an earlier village in the area that is today Southfield.

Resting spots along the Underground Railroad, where runaway slaves could sleep and eat, were called &quot;depots&quot;. One of these was the Foster Farmhouse (built in 1833) in Walled Lake, which served as a refuge for those making their way to freedom in Canada. The Foster Farmhouse was located on Pontiac Trail near 15 mile road until 1997, when it was moved to Riley Park in downtown Walled Lake to avoid demolition.

in the 1920s Herman chankush ordered the walled lake amusement park to be built and then he died in 1928 and then memorial Day of 1929 the Park finally opened and then it did a very good 39 years until competition with Edgewater Park and Boblo island so then in 1968 the amusement park was closed

In 1819, Alpheus Williams and Archibald Phillips continued on to where the Clinton River crossed the old Saginaw Trail (now known as Dixie Highway). They settled at the site of the present Waterford Village. Here the first house of Waterford Village was built by Alpheus Williams on the north bank of the river. Archibald Phillips built his home across from the south corner where Andersonville Road meets Dixie Highway.

Williams and Phillips also built the first dam where the Clinton River crossed the Saginaw Trail and erected the first sawmill.

The township was named Waterford because of the vast number of lakes covering the township.

==Transportation==
Oakland County International Airport is located in Waterford Township. The airport is a hub for the airline Lakeshore Express, a local commuter airline to Pellston, and Chicago-Midway

==Railroad==
In 1851, the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway came through Waterford Township and three train depots were built in Waterford Township; the Drayton Plains depot (at Hatchery Rd.), the Waterford depot (at Airport Rd.) and the Windiate depot (at Windiate Rd.) . The railroad helped make the many lakes of the Waterford area easily accessible to summer vacationers from the big cities and served to make Waterford Township a summer resort area.
In 1882, the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway was purchased by the Grand Trunk Western Railroad.

As roads were improved, people began driving to their summer resort area and the passenger depots were closed in the late 1950s.

The Windiate Park Hotel was a summer resort for vacationers from Detroit and
Lansing. The resort was easily accessed by four trains a day during the summer months from the 1890s to the 1940s and was located on Lotus Lake, near the Windiate depot. The resort featured boating, fishing, sailing, sunbathing, tennis and a dance hall. The resort was owned by J.D. and M.L. Rice.

Another popular summer resort was the Waterford Hotel in the village of Waterford. The hotel was sold to William Bradt, who changed its name to Bradt&#x27;s Exchange. The hotel was also named the Waterford Exchange, and served as a stagecoach stop for over 60 years.

Today, the railroad is owned by Canadian National Railway (CN) and passenger service is no longer offered, giving way to freight only.

There are seven railroad crossings in Waterford Township and one railroad bridge.

==Education==
===Public schools===
The Waterford School District operates public schools in most of Waterford Township (the Pontiac School District serves a small portion of the township).

In 1961, Kettering High School opened and Mott High School opened in 1969. Kettering&#x27;s address is now 2800 Kettering Drive in Waterford. In 2012, Durant High School, an alternative school, opened in the township at 501 N. Cass Lake Road in Waterford. All three Waterford Township public high schools were named after automobile industry pioneers; William C. Durant, Charles F. Kettering, and Charles S. Mott. Waterford Township High School was located in Waterford Township, Michigan at the corner of Highland Rd. and Crescent Lake Rd. It was closed as a high school in 1983, but the Board of Education continued to use the building for several years for various purposes. (Waterford Township: Year Opened: 1947, Year Closed: 1983).

In 1957, John D. Pierce Junior High School opened at 5145 Hatchery Road in Waterford, and Stevens T. Mason Junior High School was opened in 1965 at 3835 West Walton Blvd. in Waterford. Both junior high schools originally included grades 7 through 9. Today, both Pierce and Mason are middle schools, which include grades 6 through 8.

As of the 2015–16 school year, the Waterford School District has nine public elementary schools located within the township; William Beaumont Elementary School, Thomas M. Cooley Elementary School, Donelson Hills Elementary School, David Grayson Elementary School, Laura S. Haviland Elementary School, Douglass Houghton Elementary School, William S. Knudsen Elementary School, Riverside Elementary School, and Henry R. Schoolcraft Elementary School.

===Private schools===
Opened in 1960, Our Lady of the Lakes School is a private Catholic K-12 school also located in the township at 5495 Dixie Highway, just south of Waterford Village.

St. Benedict School in Waterford was in operation until circa 2003, when the campus became the lower (elementary school) of Notre Dame Preparatory School and Marist Academy; this occurred in a time when other Catholic elementary schools in the area closed. The lower school moved to the common Pontiac campus in 2013.

===Community College===
Waterford Township is home to the Oakland Community College Highland Lakes Campus. The campus, which opened in 1965, is located at 7350 Cooley Lake Road in Waterford.

Oakland Schools, the intermediate school district serving Oakland County, has its offices in Waterford Township.

==Public library==
The Waterford Township Public Library serves the residents of the township. It is located at 5168 Civic Center Drive, off of Crescent Lake Road near Hatchery Road in Waterford.

==Public safety==
Waterford Township maintains its own police and fire departments.

The Waterford Police Department was founded in 1953. Frank VanAtta was appointed the first Waterford Chief of Police, earning a yearly salary of $5,500. William Stokes was a long-time chief who had some 30 years of service before retiring in 1985. He was followed by Robert (Duke) Reynolds, who graduated the FBI National Academy, and then Gary Root, Paul Valad, John Dean and Daniel McCaw. The current chief, Scott Underwood, retired as a Captain at the Warren Police Department.

The police station is located at 5150 Civic Center Drive in 
Waterford near the Waterford Township Hall and the 51st District Court in the Waterford Civic Center Complex. The police department was drastically cut in 2010 due to the falling economy and the closing of 2 of the largest commercial tax sources- The Summit Place Mall and a General Motors facility. The department went from over 100 sworn police officers to 55 which was similar to the number of officers in the 1970s. A recent tax increase voted on by the residents is supposed to add 9 more officers. Waterford still remains one of the largest physical and populated areas in Oakland County but remains on the bottom of police officers per population. The department has a current force of roughly 25 patrol officers for the population of over 70,000 residents. The Waterford Regional Fire Department employs 144. It is currently the 4th largest Fire Department in the State of Michigan. Waterford Township also provides Fire, EMS, and Dispatch services to the neighboring City of Pontiac and City of Lake Angelus.

<text>Wixom ( ) is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northwestern suburb of Detroit, Wixom is located roughly from downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 17,193.

The city was home to the now-demolished Wixom Assembly Plant, which operated from 1957–2007. The city is also home to several production and manufacturing businesses, including Trijicon, Discraft, NGK, Rockwell Medical and Majic Window.

==History==
The settlement of Wixom dates back to 1831. In the beginning, Wixom was named Sibley&#x27;s Corners after the first settler, 20 year old philanthropist Alonzo Sibley. Sibley settled in what is today called Commerce Township, where he purchased approximately 80 acres of land. Over time, Sibley purchased about 350 more acres of land. In 1837 Sibley donated a portion of his property for a local cemetery; which was called South Commerce Burial Ground; however, was later changed to Wixom Cemetery. Sibley then became the president of the cemetery association.

The establishment of Wixom as a place started in 1871 when Willard Clark Wixom (son of Ahijah C. Wixom and Lucy Clark) granted a right of way through his property for the Holly, Wayne and Monroe Railway. Willard platted land on both sides of the railroad near the Novi and Commerce Township border. In 1883, Willard opened his property up to become an important railroad junction to make way for the Michigan Airline Railroad Grand Trunk Western Railroad. With the new junction, Willard located the railroad station, union depot (called Wixom Station) and mail drop at the intersection of his property. The construction of the railroad junction attracted many new business investments, stores, a lumber yard, and a cider mill, ultimately turning the small village into Michigan&#x27;s largest grain produce handling point. The name of the town was then change from Sibley&#x27;s Corners to Wixom. On December 24, 1901, Willard was struck and killed by a passenger train while crossing the tracks in his horse and buggy.

The village of Wixom was incorporated in the 1950s following the announcement of plans to construct the Wixom Assembly Plant in Novi Township. Prior to that time, Wixom was an unincorporated place. The village borders included portions of both Novi and Commerce Townships. Efforts by the remainder of Novi Township to incorporate as a village prompted the newly established village of Wixom to incorporate as a city. The city largely follows the borders of the village although a small area of parkland on the north side of the city was annexed from Commerce Township in the 1970s.

On November 13, 1996, Gerald Atkins &quot;shot his way&quot; (according to eyewitness reports) into the Ford Wixom Assembly Plant with a CAR-15 semi-automatic rifle, eventually killing plant manufacturing manager Darrell Izzard (aged 57) in a hallway; the shooter wounded three others. Fleeing the plant, Atkins hid in storm drain tunnels while law enforcement surrounded the plant and trained their weapons from as far away as the Interstate 96 freeway. Hours later he surrendered.

=== Federal, state, and county legislators ===

== Downtown Development ==
The downtown area of the city was developed with a new main street area on Pontiac Trail by the city offices called the Wixom Village Center. This was a $200 million project. The Village Center includes a pedestrian plaza, restaurants, and service shops. The residential development called Tribute of Wixom will contains 600 units that include ranch-style condos, town houses, and single-family homes. The project was postponed in 2008 and construction did not begin again until 2014.

Wixom Downtown Development Authority (DDA)

The DDA’s primary source of revenue is Tax Increment Financing (TIF). TIF capture occurs through the normal increase in property taxes over the base year the DDA was established, due to new investment (building of homes and businesses for example) and/or inflation. So, as property values rise in the DDA District over the base year, the DDA captures the increase in value and invests those funds back into the district.

Priorities of Focus 2024/2025

1. Renton Area Redevelopment: The DDA, along with the City of Wixom, will focus on the redevelopment of City owned parcels.

2. Branding, Logo, and Wayfinding Signage: In conjunction with the City of Wixom, the DDA will be working with Guide Studios out of Cleveland, OH on the rebranding of Downtown Wixom/City of Wixom and creating a plan for wayfinding signage to be incorporated into the entire City of Wixom.

3. The Civic Center Playground: In partnership with the Parks &amp; Rec Commission, and the Library Board, a new playground was constructed in 2024, with a budgeted investment from the Wixom DDA of $250,000.

4. West End Commons: The DDA is actively pursuing grant funding and other funding sources for the development of this area. Congressional funding: $738,400.00; OC ARPA Funding: $206,868.00; DDA Funding: $320,000.00.

Recent Projects

Originally part of Elbridge Township, Leavitt Township was separated and named for Hazen Leavitt, the first settler in the area, who arrived in 1864. A descendant of Thomas Leavitt, one of the first English settlers of New Hampshire, Hazen Leavitt was born in Percy, Coos County, New Hampshire. The following year settlers David Lampson and John Henning arrived, likely with their families.

By the 21st century, the rural area was known for its asparagus crops. It has attracted Hispanic workers in agriculture.

<text>Rose City is a city in Ogemaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 653 at the 2010 census, which ranks it as the seventh-smallest city by population in the state.

==History==
Churchill was the original name of this lumbering town, which was located from its present location. Hiram Hodge was the first resident of the community. He built a hotel, but later left the area. The Rose family, including Allan S. Rose, his father and two brothers, came from New York State in 1875. Allan S. Rose formed a partnership with M.H. French, known as the &quot;French and Rose Land Company&quot;, and started a new settlement. The many lumber operations were after the giant pine and old timber found in the area. They cleared land and built a general store, settler&#x27;s cabins, and boarding houses. A post office opened with the name Churchill on September 8, 1875.

On July 23, 1892, the settlement was moved to the east, and the post office&#x27;s name was changed to Rose City, in honor of the Rose family. Rose City was incorporated as a fourth-class city in 1905. In 1910, the city suffered a major fire that destroyed the business section within an hour, with thirty buildings burning down. This fire caused the end of Rose City&#x27;s lumbering center, as many businesses decided not to rebuild.

The area began to see several improvements from 1945 to 1960, including the construction of a sewer system, paved streets, and streetlights. There are many artesian wells found in Rose City&#x27;s main water supply still today, and Rose City was once referred to as &quot;The Home of Artesian Wells&quot;. In October 1962, Rose City&#x27;s school district was combined with that of neighboring West Branch to become the West Branch-Rose City Area Schools district.

In 2002, the city of Rose City and the site of its historic fire were designated as Michigan State Historic Sites, with a double-sided historic marker erected in Rose City Park. Near Rose City Park is the Cleveland Park Pavilion, which is also a registered historic site.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.74%) is water.

Houghton Creek, a tributary of the Rifle River, runs through part of the city limits. The Rifle River State Recreation Area, which can be used for year-round activities like canoeing, swimming, fishing, and snowmobiling, is about to the east. There are 75 lakes within 15 miles of the city limits.

<text>Greenland Township is a civil township of Ontonagon County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 628 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Michigan and the entire old Northwest Territory were gridded into 36 square mile geographic townships. Due to the mountainous terrain and low population density, both the counties and their political subdivisional townships in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula were defined in order to keep communities connected to their county seats. Greenland Township is irregularly shaped and three times the size of a geographic township, containing the source streams for a number of rivers, so it was not difficult in early days to ford streams within the township.

In the 1920s, copper mines had spur connections in Greenland Township to the Copper Range Railroad and the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad, driving population growth of the communities of Greenland (in Section 26), Lake Mine (Section 31), Mass City (Straddling sections 5, 35 and 36), McKeever (Section 9), Peppard (Section 4), Riddle Junction (DSS&amp;A connection in Section 18) and Simar (Section 33). (The 21st century Simar landing strip is just east in Bohemia Township).

== History ==
It was the forests that first attracted settlers, as land to the south and east had already been cleared for farms. The demand for lumber was great and professional land lookers were sent out to find the best timber tracts which could be bought for $1.25 or less per acre. Much of the land was purchased by railroad companies, lumbermen, and land speculators.  In 1864 the railroad had an agent in the area, although the first train did not reach the area until the latter part of November 1871. 

The location that later became LeRoy Township was called &quot;end of twenty&quot; by the railroad, so called as the result of a decision by the railroad to build the railroad twenty miles north of Paris, its terminal at the time. 

The township was organized from Lincoln Township by order of the Board with its local government established at a meeting on April 4 of 1870.

The community was founded in 1881 and was originally called &quot;Mioe&quot;, in honor of Marla Deyarmond, the wife of town founder Henry Deyarmond. Other founders included Colige Comins, Reirlo Fosdick, and John Randall. A post office named Mioe opened May 3, 1882. The name changed to Mio on November 21, 1883.

===State high temperature record===
Mio holds the state record for the highest recorded temperature, when it reached on July 13, 1936. An identical temperature was also recorded on the same day in the village of Stanwood, in Mecosta County.

===PBB contamination event===
In 1973, a polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) contamination event caused farmers in the area to destroy their herds. This event occurred when a dock worker accidentally shipped five hundred pounds of fire retardant Fire Master instead of the feed supplement Nutrimaster, leading to the contamination of various farm animals, including cows, pigs, chickens, and sheep. Shortly after, the farmers noticed deformities and sickness among their livestock and newborn calves. More than 35,000 cows were found to be contaminated and had to be destroyed. Out of these, 1,300 were dumped into a clay-lined pit in Mio. As of 2014, PBB is still detectable in the blood tests of some people in this area.

===Detroit-area hunters murdered===
For nearly eighteen years, Mio was thrust into the local and national media spotlight due to a case involving two Detroit-area hunters who went missing in the fall of 1985. Progress in the investigation was stymied by area residents&#x27; refusal to help, citing fears of violent reprisal. On November 21, 1985, childhood friends David Tyll and Brian Ognjan were beaten to death with baseball bats outside of a local bar. The case was eventually cracked in 2003, when two brothers, Raymond and Donald Duvall, both from South Branch, in Iosco County, were convicted of murdering the pair near Mio. It was rumored that the murderers had disposed of the bodies by feeding them to pigs. When the two brothers were sentenced to life in prison without parole, Tyll&#x27;s father said, &quot;They took my son. It doesn&#x27;t bring him back, but it&#x27;s something.&quot; A true account of the crimes was detailed in &quot;Darker Than Night&quot;, a 2006 book by Tom Henderson.

===Historical markers===
There are two historical markers in Mio.
* Mio Hydroelectric Plant was built in 1916 on the lower Au Sable River. William W. Tefft, a Consumers Power civil and hydraulic engineer, invented and patented the so-called &quot;conduit spillway&quot;, which channels excessive flow through channels built into the plant. This was the first plant to use it, and it is cheaper than other forms of spillways.
* Oscoda County Courthouse was built in 1888. It was destroyed by a fire on May 5, 2016. Construction of a new building officially began on May 20, 2019, and was completed in February 2020.

== Amish community ==
In 1900, Mio’s first Amish settlers arrived from Geauga County, Ohio. These settlers were considered &quot;Old Order Amish&quot; and followed strict rules. The fairly inexpensive land prices brought in more Amish settlers, and in the first five years, the community grew rapidly. The settlers took advantage of the once wooded land by growing clover, hay, peas, corn, and potatoes, as well as other bumper crops. Eventually, the Old Order Amish began to dwindle in numbers due to a large number joining the Amish-Mennonite congregation, which held more progressive beliefs. In 1954, the Old Order Amish became extinct when the congregation&#x27;s last bishop passed away. In 1970, a new group of Amish, also from Geauga County, Ohio, settled in Mio, founding the fourth oldest Amish community. The three church district community is home to around 400 individuals. Although many of the Old Order Amish transitioned to following the Mennonite congregation due to their more progressive beliefs, the Amish that are settled in Mio today still follow a strict set of commands. However, Amish commands do vary from community to community.

Mio-AuSable currently offers two Advanced Placement (AP) courses, AP Biology and AP Calculus AB. The school does not offer any Honors courses, but to make up for the lack of advanced classes, students are encouraged to dual-enroll through Kirtland Community College. Sophomores, juniors and seniors can choose to take online classes through the nearby community college, and if the students receive at least a C in a course, they will be granted college credit in that course which may transfer into the university of their choice after high school.

<text>Allendale Charter Township is a charter township of Ottawa County in the U.S. state of Michigan. At the 2020 Census, the township population was 26,582. Allendale Charter Township is best known as being home to the main campus of Grand Valley State University.

Allendale is located in the center of Ottawa County, bordered by Tallmadge Township, Polkton Township, Robinson Township, Blendon Township and Georgetown Township.

==History==
The land within the current borders of the township has been inhabited by humans since at least ca. 200 BCE to 500 CE, earliest evidence suggests occupation by Goodall focus, a Middle Woodland Hopewellian culture. At the time of European contact, Anishinaabe-speaking peoples, the Odawa and the Potawatomi lived within the current township.

The first documented European in what is now Allendale was Pierre Constant, a French fur trader who established a trading post at Charleston for John Jacob Astor&#x27;s American Fur Company in 1810. The first permanent European settler was Richard Roberts, of Wales, who purchased one hundred and sixty acres along the Grand River, building a log cabin in 1842 that became known as the Half-way House, as it was situated roughly halfway between Grand Haven and Grandville. Roberts established a sawmill, a blacksmith shop, a wheelwright and a store.

In the winter of 1848–49, a meeting was held at the home of Alexander Milne for the purpose of drafting a petition requesting to become an organized Township, to be called the Township of Isaac. Those attending the meeting, along with Milne, were James Scott, Johnson Balcom, Alexander Scott, Robert Scott, John Hanna and Henry M. Reed. James Scott drew up the township petition which was signed by all of them. The petition was presented to the state legislature by state Senator Henry Pennoyer of Grand Haven. Senator Pennoyer, on his own initiative, substituted Isaac with the (misspelled) &quot;Allandale&quot; after Agnes Allen, the first name appearing on the tax roll, and the widow of Hannibal Allen, son of Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen. The spelling was subsequently changed from Allandale to the current Allendale.

In 1854 the township of Blendon was organized, and set off from Allendale.

Grand Valley State University is the fastest growing university in the United States, both in population and physical size, as the university is continually building more facilities.

==Parks==
Allendale Community Park is a park situated near the township office. It contains a Veterans Garden of Honor honoring U.S. soldiers. It contains nine statues representing veterans of U.S. wars. One of the statues, installed in 1998, depicting a Confederate and Union soldier standing back-to-back with a young slave crouched between them at their feet, has been controversial for seeming to honor the Confederacy and portraying racial dynamics in a way considered disrespectful to Black people.

During the George Floyd protests in 2020, the civil war statue received heightened scrutiny from local activists. Philomena Mantella, president of Grand Valley State University, suggested that it should be moved and that its presentation should be altered to acknowledge its historical context. The Allendale Township Board voted on June 30, 2020, to keep the statue in the park. Protests on the issue continued through 2021, including the temporary erection of a billboard and multiple acts of vandalism that left the statue disfigured. A contentious second referendum on June 14, 2021, resulted in the statue being retained once again.

<text>Grand Haven is a city within the U.S. state of Michigan and the county seat of Ottawa County. Grand Haven is located on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Grand River, for which it is named. As of the 2020 census, Grand Haven had a population of 11,011. The city is home to the Grand Haven Memorial Airpark (3GM) and is located just north of Grand Haven Charter Township.

==History==

The Potawatomi and Ottawa Native Americans lived in the area for centuries and used the river as a trade route into the interior of Michigan. Some of the long cultures of the Ottawa tribe is being revealed through the excavation of archeological artifacts.

The city dates its European-American founding to French colonial settlers. A fur trading outpost called &quot;Gabagouache&quot; was first established by Madeline La Framboise and her husband Joseph.

After the War of 1812, this area became more settled by Americans. A trading post was established here about 1821 by the American Fur Company, but the first permanent resident was a Presbyterian minister, William Montague Ferry, who founded in 1834 the first area church. Settler Rix Robinson named the town &quot;Grand Haven&quot; in 1835. Sheldon Tannery was founded in 1838, developing to process leathers from the fur trade and cattle. The second church was organized in 1850. Ferry founded the city&#x27;s first bank in 1851 in the Ferry &amp; Son building on Harbor Drive. He also started a school, Ferry Elementary, which continues to operate. The city was incorporated in 1867.

In the mid-to-late 19th century, Grand Haven developed as a logging, lumber mill, and shipping town, as well as a shipbuilding center.

The city was served by the Grand Trunk Railway, which ran along the waterfront near the river. Its depot and offices have been adapted for use as a historical museum. The &quot;Story and Clark Piano Company&quot; built pianos in the city from 1900 to 1984. The smokestack at the piano factory collapsed during the Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1998. In August 2006, Eagle-Ottawa Leather Co., which developed from the 1838 Sheldon Tannery, announced it would close its local operations that year.

Given the importance of shipping and water trade to the city, the Grand Haven Lighthouses were built in 1839 on the south pier, to mark the most navigable channel into the river. The current lighthouses, painted red, were built in 1875 (outer light) and 1905 (inner). They are connected by a lighted catwalk, which runs along the pier to the shore.

George &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson and Homer Van Meter, who became notorious 1930s criminals, committed their first bank robbery at a Grand Haven bank. Nelson teamed up with Eddie Bentz to rob the People&#x27;s Saving Bank on the corner of 3rd St. and Washington Ave. Bullet holes can still be found in some of the neighboring brick buildings.

James Cronkright and his wife were the first settlers in the township. In 1843 they settled in Section 11 in where they built a 16 X 22 foot house. The closest neighbors were over four miles away and there were no roads. Bears, wolves, deer and other wild animals were common. Some were important for food. S.L. Gitchel first settled on the SW corner of Sec.1 in 1845 and finally on Sec.33. He became a specialist in making small bridges and corduroy roads. Monsur Brown, parents of Mrs. Gitchel, followed in 1846 settling in the SE corner of Sec. 11 with a son James M. Brown who was married three years later. He also settled in Sec.11. More families followed from the east but some Hollanders were entering from the west. Later Germans entered from the south.

Until 1849, Georgetown and Jamestown were under the same jurisdiction. All taxes were paid in Jenison. Evidently there were no printed blanks, for tax receipts were written out in full.

Twelve voters were required in what is now Jamestown before the towns could be separated. In 1849 there were a sufficient number and steps were taken to bring this about. The meeting took place at the James Cronkright Jr. home in Sec. 11. In April, Mrs. Cronkright prepared a dinner for the men and spent the day with her mother. Twelve men attended and were assisted by a Mr. James Scott from Grandville. Each was elected to an office.

Of the twelve men present one-third were named James, so this new township was named Jamestown. Six men living in the township were not there. It is believed that four men from the western part of the township could not yet speak English.

There were fifteen residents on the first 1849-tax roll covering seventeen parcels of land. These seventeen parcels were found in only 9 of the 36 sections of the township. Six of those sections were in the west one third of the township. Eleven family names were included in those fifteen residents.

In 1850 the town meeting was held at the Cronkright home again but the 1851 and 1852 meetings were held at the first log schoolhouse in Sec. 11. In 1853 it was held at the log schoolhouse in Jamestown Center, which was the second schoolhouse in the township.
The Forest Grove log school was built in 1853 by the third district in the township, out of seven, that finally served the township&#x27;s educational needs for many years.

=== Defunding of library system ===

In August 2022, 62% of township primary voters chose to defund the township&#x27;s Patmos library system, which was initially expected to force the library to close in 2023. Before the vote, fewer than 50 township residents had complained about the presence of three books discussing the life stories of LGBT people: &quot;Gender Queer&quot; by Maia Kobabe, &quot;Kiss Number 8&quot; by Colleen AF Venable, and &quot;Spinning&quot; by Tillie Walden. The activists who sought to defund the library system claimed that the presence of these books in the library&#x27;s young adult and adult sections meant the library was trying to &quot;groom&quot; young children, with a prominent activist claiming that the book &quot;Gender Queer&quot; was pornographic. Community members also sent the library director angry messages on Facebook, attempted to film her without her permission, and accused her of not being of Christian faith; as a result of this treatment, the library director resigned. A second director and two staff members have also quit during the year due to harassment. The library board stood firm saying they would not participate in banning books. Due to the books not being banned the activist group, Jamestown Conservatives, advocated for removing the operating funds of the library.

According to the Library Board President, without the fund renewal, &quot;the library will run out of money in 2023, jeopardizing its existence.&quot; In response to the threat of defunding the library, online fundraisers were created to help the library temporarily. At least two GoFundMe accounts were started to fund the library through 2023; and by Sunday, August 28, approximately 4,000 people had donated to the campaign, including a donation from romance author Nora Roberts. By September 9, the campaign had successfully past the goal of .

Following the August 8th meeting, the library board agreed to have a November millage which initially used the same language as the August millage. This required a special election that was paid for by the library system due to the township not having any local elections in November. The November millage ended up being modified slightly for the special election. In the November election, the millage was again defeated; this time by 55% of township voters. Jamestown Conservatives had again pushed for the millage to be defeated.

<text>Zeeland ( ) is a city in Ottawa County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 5,719 at the 2020 census. The city is located at the western edge of Zeeland Charter Township. Its name is taken from the Dutch province of Zeeland.

==History==
In 1847, nearly 500 Dutch citizens sailed for America ostensibly to achieve religious freedom, although their decision to immigrate was probably also influenced by other factors, such as dire economic conditions in their home province of Zeeland, Netherlands and their opposition to modern scientific and social advances of the time.

The emigrants were led by James Van de Luyster, a wealthy landowner who sold his holdings in the Netherlands to advance money for the members to pay their debts and buy passage to America. Their settlement, some of land once occupied by the Odawa people, was named after their home province of Zeeland.

Van de Luyster arranged for three ships to sail for the United States. He came on the first ship, arriving on June 27, 1847. He was followed by the Steketee group on July 4, and Reverend Van Der Meulen&#x27;s group on August 1 of that year. The total number of settlers was 457.

The first building was a church. The town of Zeeland was platted in 1849, and the school district was organized the following year.

Within twenty-five years, Zeeland had acquired a sawmill, a wagon factory, blacksmith shops, grocery stores, and a post office.

The village officially became a city in 1907. There was a two-story brick kindergarten building, a two-story brick grade school, and a brick house building. The city also had four furniture factories, one large manufacturing plant, and several mills and smaller manufacturing industries.

==Geography==

;School issues
*In 2012, Zeeland school district superintendent Dave Barry was accused of plagiarism for using text from a blog post by Mark Rutherford without giving credit. The school board decided to punish Barry by suspending him for two weeks without pay. Barry said he respected the board&#x27;s decision and promised it would not happen again, saying that he had &quot;fallen short of the mark.&quot; Barry also said that this was not the only time he has taken credit for someone&#x27;s work, but the number of times he has done so has not been released to the public.
*Prior to the release of the 1998 album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; by the band Korn, Gretchen Plewes, a Zeeland high school assistant principal, said in an interview for a Michigan newspaper that the group&#x27;s music is &quot;indecent, vulgar, obscene and intends to be insulting&quot; after giving a student, Eric VanHoven, a one-day suspension for wearing a shirt with the Korn logo on it. WKLQ was filmed giving away hundreds of free Korn T-shirts, which were donated by the band, outside the school. Ottawa County policemen helped hand out shirts as well. Korn filed a cease and desist order against Plewes and the school district for their comments. They also threatened a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, but both actions were dropped due to the band members&#x27; personal lives.
