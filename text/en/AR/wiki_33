<text>Zaltbommel (), also known, historically and colloquially, as Bommel, is a municipality and a city in the Netherlands.

== History ==

=== The city of Zaltbommel ===
The town of Zaltbommel was first mentioned as &quot;Bomela&quot; in the year 850. Zaltbommel received city rights in 1231 and these were renewed in 1316. In 1599 during the Eighty Years War, Zaltbommel was besieged by Spanish forces but was relieved by an Anglo-Dutch force led by Maurice of Orange. The bridge over the Waal at Zaltbommel (which has since been replaced) features in a celebrated twentieth-century Dutch sonnet, &quot;De moeder de vrouw&quot;, by Martinus Nijhoff.

Zaltbommel was expanded to its current size on 1 January 1999, by a merger of the municipalities of Brakel, Kerkwijk and Zaltbommel. The municipality is situated in the heart of the Netherlands, close to the A2 Motorway, the railway line from Utrecht to &#x27;s‑Hertogenbosch and the rivers Waal and Maas.

<text>Zelhem is a town in the Dutch province of Gelderland. It has approximately 11,000 inhabitants. Zelhem is located in the municipality of Bronckhorst, about 7 km northeast of Doetinchem.

Zelhem was a separate municipality until 2005, when it became a part of Bronckhorst. The municipality used to cover an area of 81.89 km2.

==History==
The village is more than 1200 years old. The modern name Zelhem originated from Salehem. This name was given to the village when a chapel was built and a gift-document was presented to the inhabitants.

The name Salehem comes from two words &#x27;Sale&#x27; which means &#x27;house&#x27; and &#x27;heim&#x27; which means &#x27;place where people are home&#x27;.

The founder of this chapel was a passionate preacher called Liudger. He brought religion to the land of the Saksen. Between 1450 and 1500 the church as we know it was built. It was dedicated to St. Lambertus, bishop of Maastricht in the time of Ludger (hence the name &#x27;Lambertikerk&#x27;).

==The myth of Smoks Hanne==
The village also has a myth of &#x27;Smoks Hanne&#x27;. She lived in Zelhem somewhere in the nineteenth century. Nowadays she&#x27;s pictured as a good witch flying on a broom. The funny part is that Smoks Hanne only has one clog (on her left foot) and the broom she&#x27;s flying on is backwards. It is assumed that Smoks Hanne lost her clog during flight. Unfortunately there&#x27;s not much information about this old lady. But when the village celebrated its 1200th anniversary, the theme was all about her.

==People born in Zelhem==
*Hedzer Rijpstra (1919-2011), politician
*Jan Remmelink (1922–2003), jurist
*Leo Klein Gebbink (born 1968), hockey player

<text>Zevenaar () is a municipality and a city in the Gelderland province, in the eastern Netherlands near the border with Germany.

In January 2018 the neighbouring municipality of Rijnwaarden was merged with Zevenaar.

==History==
The earliest signs of human activity are remains of a 700 BC settlement found near present-day Zevenaar. In 1049, Emperor Hendrik III donated a large amount of land to five warlords the leader of whom was named Bartholomeus II of Sevenaer. They founded a castle to protect the old Roman settlements from the Germans.

In 1355 Sevenaer passed from the control of the county/Duchy of Guelders (to which the modern Dutch province of Gelderland refers) to the Duchy of Cleves (Cleveland).

In 1487, the duke of Cleves gave Sevenaer city rights. Sevenaer was an important strategic point – the area between Gelderland and Cleveland was the border between the regions that would, over the centuries, be controlled from different centers of power – the modern states of The Netherlands and Prussia (later, Germany). Some of the Castles and houses in Zevenaar have foundations dating back to the 14th century, including Huize Sevenaer.

When Sevenaer obtained city rights, it had the monopoly on markets and on sale of bread and beer with the surrounding towns. Also the jurisdiction in Sevenaer was founded, with the town government charging taxes so that the town could build roads and public buildings. For the 500 inhabitants this was a heavy tax. Because of the plundering by passing armies, there were not enough supplies and money to build anything. In that time some well-to-do families got the right to participate in government. Sevenaer then experienced a prosperous period. 

In 1614 Sevenaer, as part of the Duchy of Cleves, fell under control of the Margraviate of Brandenburg which would eventually become part of Prussia. 

In 1793 the city had 900 inhabitants.

In 1816, Sevenaer became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Two years later the old spelling of Sevenaer was changed to the current name: Zevenaar. The municipality then had 2564 inhabitants. The 19th century was a time of poverty, bad harvests, sicknesses and hunger, with little trade and work. Many people lived by agriculture or from charity. In 1856 Zevenaar was connected to the European railroad system which, some decades later, led to the increase in workforce. 

In 1920, the cigarette factory Turmac came which insured more employment.

After the second World War, which caused a lot of damage, people started to rebuild, and new residential areas arose around the old core. In the 1950s approximately 10,000 people lived in Zevenaar. By 2005, that number had more than doubled to 22,500 inhabitants. The municipality of Zevenaar consists of the following residential areas, which together had 31,840 inhabitants in January 2007 (source: CBS).

==History==

===Origins===
The School of Oriental Studies was founded in 1916 at 2 Finsbury Circus, London, the then premises of the London Institution. The school received its royal charter on 5 June 1916 and admitted its first students on 18 January 1917. The school was formally inaugurated a month later on 23 February 1917 by George V. Among those in attendance were Earl Curzon of Kedleston, formerly Viceroy of India, and other cabinet officials.

The School of Oriental Studies was founded by the British state as an instrument to strengthen Britain&#x27;s political, commercial, and military presence in Asia and Africa. It would do so by providing instruction to colonial administrators (Colonial Service and Imperial Civil Service), commercial managers, and military officers, as well as to missionaries, doctors, and teachers, in the language of the part of Asia or Africa to which each was being posted, together with an authoritative introduction to the customs, religions, laws, and history of the people whom they were to govern or among whom they would be working.

The school&#x27;s founding mission was to advance British scholarship, science, and commerce in Africa and Asia, and to provide London University with a rival to the Oriental schools of Berlin, Petrograd, and Paris. The school immediately became integral to training British administrators, colonial officials, and spies for overseas postings across the British Empire. Africa was added to the school&#x27;s name in 1938.

===Second World War===
For a period in the mid-1930s, prior to moving to its current location at Thornhaugh Street, Bloomsbury, the school was located at Vandon House, Vandon Street, London SW1, with the library located at Clarence House. Its move to new premises in Bloomsbury was held up by delays in construction and the half-completed building took a hit during the Blitz in September 1940. With the onset of the Second World War, many University of London colleges were evacuated from London in 1939 and billeted on universities in the rest of the country. The School was, on the Government&#x27;s advice, transferred to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

In 1940, when it became apparent that a return to London was possible, the school returned to the city and was housed for some months in eleven rooms at Broadway Court, 8 Broadway, London SW1. In 1942, the War Office joined with the school to create a scheme for State Scholarships to be offered to select grammar and public-school boys with linguistic ability to train as military translators and interpreters in Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Turkish. Lodged at Dulwich College in south London, the students became affectionately known as &quot;the Dulwich boys&quot;. One of these students was Charles Dunn, who became a prominent Japanologist on the faculty of the SOAS and a recipient of the Order of the Rising Sun. Others included Sir Peter Parker and Ronald Dore. Subsequently, the School ran a series of courses in Japanese, both for translators and for interpreters.

===1945–present===

In recognition of SOAS&#x27;s role during the war, the 1946 Scarborough Commission (officially the &quot;Commission of Enquiry into the Facilities for Oriental, Slavonic, East European and African Studies&quot;) report recommended a major expansion in provision for the study of Asia and the school benefited greatly from the subsequent largesse. The SOAS School of Law was established in 1947 with Seymour Gonne Vesey-FitzGerald as its first head. Growth however was curtailed by following years of economic austerity, and upon Sir Cyril Philips assuming the directorship in 1956, the school was in a vulnerable state. Over his 20-year stewardship, Phillips transformed the school, raising funds and broadening the school&#x27;s remit.

A college of the University of London, the School&#x27;s fields include Law, Social Sciences, Humanities, and Languages with special reference to Asia and Africa. The SOAS Library, located in the Philips Building, is the UK&#x27;s national resource for materials relating to Asia and Africa and is the largest of its kind in the world. The school has grown considerably over the past 30 years, from fewer than 1,000 students in the 1970s to more than 6,000 students today, nearly half of them postgraduates. SOAS is partnered with the Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales (INALCO) in Paris which is often considered the French equivalent of SOAS.

In 2011, the Privy Council approved changes to the school&#x27;s charter allowing it to award degrees in its own name, following the trend set by fellow colleges the London School of Economics, University College London and King&#x27;s College London. All new students registered from September 2013 will qualify for a SOAS, University of London, award.

In 2012, a new visual identity for SOAS was launched to be used in print, digital media and around the campus. The SOAS tree symbol, first implemented in 1989, was redrawn and recoloured in gold, with the new symbol incorporating the leaves of ten trees, including the English Oak representing England; the Bodhi, Coral Bark Maple, Teak representing Asia; the Mountain Acacia, African Pear, Lasiodiscus representing Africa; and the Date Palm, Pomegranate and Ghaf representing the Middle East.

=== Student Politics===

==== Israel and Palestine ====
SOAS has a student body of which many are committed anti-Zionists.The SOAS Student’s Union was the first Student Union to carry out a referendum, in 2005, to support the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement for goods stocked in the Student Union, and in 2015, the SOAS Student Union held a referendum in which its members voted to adopt the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions directions more generally in the university. In 2022, students occupied the management section of the university for nine days, citing the university&#x27;s investments in Israel amongst other reasons, which led to the university spending £200,000 in their eviction. After Israel&#x27;s war in Gaza. university management suspended seven students protesting the university&#x27;s investments in Israel and partnership with Haifa university, a university in Israel with three military colleges and a military base on campus. These students stated that the suspensions were arbitrary and a &quot;targeted act of political repression&quot;, whereas the university replied that the students were a &quot;threat to the SOAS community&quot;. In the same period, a lecturer reported that security had removed a poster with the Palestinian flag from her door. SOAS responded that the display of the Palestinian flag violated &quot;safegaurding&quot;.

SOAS has multiple investments in Israel. It had, until divestment from Abermarle alone last year, £405, 914 invested in Abermarle (a U.S.-based chemicals manufacturer described as involved in the production of weaponry sent to Israel from the United States and used against Palestinians), £668,544 invested in Barclays, (which invests over £1.1 million in companies supplying the Israeli military with weapons), £775,754 invested in Sony (which provides surveillance equipment to Israel), the £2,052,560 invested in Microsoft (which has dozens of “extended engineering services” with Israeli military battalions, in which, according to the company’s website, “Microsoft experts become an integral part of the [customer’s] team.), and £1,624,536 in Alphabet (which has a $1.2bn contract to provide services used for tracking and facial recognition with the Israeli military, a fact that is so politically controversial that it has led to worker sit-ins at the company) 

SOAS has an active Jewish Society which is explicitly anti-Zionist. In 2024, and in the context of university protest camps established around the world relating to Israel&#x27;s war in Gaza, SOAS director Adam Habib hosted a high-level meeting about antisemitism on campus, extending an invite to various Jewish academics on campus, but excluding any representation from the Jewish Society. On April 19th, 2024, SOAS posted a job advert for a new Jewish Chaplain whose key responsibilities include supporting “the implementation of a Jewish Society within the Student Union,” therefore implicating that the existing Jewish Society would be replaced by a society organised from the top down.

In December 2020 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that SOAS refunded a student £15,000 in fees after he chose to abandon his studies as a result of the &quot;toxic antisemitic environment&quot; he felt had been allowed to develop on campus. Examples of matters he considered anti-Semitic are, according to the Guardian report previously cited, that being pro-Israel was described as &quot;Zionist&quot;, the student body&#x27;s public support of the BDS movement, and that his proposal to write a thesis on percieved anti-Israel bias at the UN led to a response that, in his words, &quot;he was covering up Israeli war crimes and was a white supremacist Nazi&quot;. He additionally stated that he had seen &quot;anti-Semitic graffiti&quot; on campus, but did not specify what this was, leaving it unclear as to whether or not he considered statements for example in support of the BDS movement as anti-Semitic. Leading Jewish figures at the university have disagreed with his assessment, with stating that they felt &quot;much more comfortable being outwardly Jewish, visibly Jewish, or having people know that I’m Jewish around SOAS students than I am in pretty much any other context in this country.” Moreover, an opposition to Zionism has been upheld in the UK courts which SOAS falls under the jurisdiction of as &quot;worthy of respect in a democratic society&quot;, and is not legally considered in itself an act of anti-Semitism.

==Campus==

The campus is located in the Bloomsbury area of central London, close to Russell Square. It includes College Buildings (the Philips Building and the Old Building), Brunei Gallery building, 53 Gordon Square (which houses the Doctoral School) and, since 2016, the Paul Webley Wing (the North Block of Senate House). The SOAS library designed by Sir Denys Lasdun in 1973 is located in the Philips Building. The nearest Underground station is Russell Square.

The school houses the Brunei Gallery, built from an endowment from the Sultan of Brunei Darussalam, the leader of a country whose human rights abuses are ongoing, and inaugurated by the Princess Royal, as Chancellor of the University of London, on 22 November 1995. Its facilities include exhibition space on three floors, a book shop, a lecture theatre, and conference and teaching facilities. The Brunei Gallery hosts a programme of changing contemporary and historical exhibitions from Asia, Africa and the Middle East with the aim to present and promote cultures from these regions.

The Japanese-style roof garden on top of the Brunei Gallery was built during the Japan 2001 celebrations and was opened by the sponsor, Haruhisa Handa, an Honorary Fellow of the School, on 13 November 2001.

The school hosted the Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art, one of the foremost collections of Chinese ceramics in Europe. The collection has been loaned to the British Museum, where it is now on permanent display in Room 95.

The SOAS Centenary Masterplan conceived the development of two new buildings and a substantial remodelling of existing space to realign and develop the entrance and two areas within the Old Building. The cost estimates for the Centenary Masterplan settle at around £73m for the total project. The full implementation of the School&#x27;s Centenary Masterplan would deliver approximately 30% additional space, approximately 1,000 sq metres.

==Governance and administration==

===Presidents===
===Directors/Vice-Chancellors===

Since its foundation, the school has had ten directors. The inaugural director was the celebrated linguist Edward Denison Ross. Under the stewardship of Cyril Philips, the school saw considerable growth and modernisation. Under Colin Bundy in the 2000s, the school became one of the top ranked universities both domestically and internationally. In January 2021 Adam Habib became director of SOAS in place of Valerie Amos, who had taken up the position of Master at University College, Oxford. In 2024, the position of director was renamed vice-chancellor.

==Academic organisation==
===Colleges and departments===
SOAS, University of London is divided into three colleges. These are further divided into academic departments. SOAS has many Centres and Institutes, each of which is affiliated to a particular faculty.

====College of Humanities====
The College of Humanities houses the School of Art, the School of History, Religions and Philosophies, and the School of Languages, Cultures and Linguistics. It offers courses at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, with an emphasis on Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. A gift from the Alphawood Foundation in 2013 created the Hiram W. Woodward Chair in Southeast Asian art, the David Snellgrove Senior Lectureship in Tibetan and Buddhist art, and a Senior Lectureship in Curating and Museology of Asian Art, as well as a number of scholarships for students, making the Department of Art &amp; Archaeology a key institution at a global level in the study of Southeast Asia. The university is also a member of the Screen Studies Group, London.

=====Department of Linguistics=====
The SOAS Department of Linguistics was the first ever linguistics department in the United Kingdom, founded in 1932 as a centre for research and study in Oriental and African languages. J. R. Firth, known internationally for his work in phonology and semantics, was a Senior Lecturer, Reader and Professor of General Linguistics at the school between 1938 and 1956.

====College of Development, Economics and Finance====
The College of Development, Economics and Finance houses the departments of Development Studies, Economics, and Finance and Management.

====College of Law, Anthropology and Politics====
The College of Law, Anthropology and Politics houses the School of Law, the departments of Anthropology and Politics and International Studies, and the centres for Gender Studies, Media Studies, the London Asia-Pacific Centre for Social Science, the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy, the Centre of Taiwan Studies and a number of department-specific centres. It offers courses at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, many with an emphasis on Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

=====SOAS School of Law=====

One of the largest individual departments, the SOAS School of Law is one of Britain&#x27;s leading law schools and the sole law school in the world focusing on the study of Asian, African and Middle Eastern legal systems. The School of Law has more than 400 students. It offers programmes at the LL.B., LL.M. and MPhil/PhD levels. International students have been a majority at all levels for many years.

The SOAS School of Law has an unrivaled concentration of expertise in the laws of Asian and African countries, human rights, transnational commercial law, environmental law, and comparative law. The SOAS School of Law was ranked 15th out of all 98 British law schools by &quot;The Guardian&quot; League Table in 2016.

Although many modules at SOAS embody a substantial element of English common law, all modules are taught (as much as possible) in a comparative or international manner with an emphasis on the way in which law functions in society. Thus, law studies at SOAS are broad and comparative in their orientation. All students study a significant amount of non-English law, starting in the first year of the LL.B. course, where &quot;Legal Systems of Asia and Africa&quot; is compulsory. Specialised modules in the laws and legal systems of particular countries and regions are also encouraged, and faculty experts conduct modules in these subjects every year.

===Institutes and regional centres===
SOAS has a number of region-specific institutions, drawing on expertise across the various colleges:
*SOAS China Institute
*SOAS Middle East Institute
*SOAS South Asia Institute
*SOAS Centre for Taiwan Studies

It also has a number of regional centres and other, non-regional institutes:
*SOAS Shapoorji Pallonji Institute of Zoroastrian Studies
*Centre of African Studies
*Centre of Contemporary Central Asia and the Caucasus
*Centre for Iranian Studies
*Centre of Korean Studies
*Centre for the Study of Pakistan
*Centre for Palestine Studies
*Centre of South East Asian Studies
*Japan Research Centre

==Academic profile==

SOAS is a centre for the study of subjects concerned with Asia, Africa and the Middle East. It trains government officials on secondment from around the world in Asian, African and Middle Eastern languages and area studies, particularly in Arabic &amp; Islamic Studies – which combined with Hebrew formed the major bulk of classical Oriental Studies in Europe – and Mandarin Chinese. It also acts as a consultant to government departments and to companies such as Accenture and Deloitte – when they seek to gain specialist knowledge of the matters concerning Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

The school has a student-staff ratio of 15:1, which in the Complete University Guide 2025 ranked 44th in the UK.

===Library===

The SOAS library is a library for Asian, African and Middle Eastern studies. It houses more than 1.2 million volumes and electronic resources for the study of Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and attracts scholars from all over the world. The library was designated by HEFCE in 2011 as one of the UK&#x27;s five National Research Libraries.

The library is housed in the Philips Building on the Russell Square campus and was built in 1973. It was designed by architect Sir Denys Lasdun, who also designed some of Britain&#x27;s most famous brutalist buildings such as the National Theatre and the Institute of Education.

In 2010/11 the library underwent a £12 million modernisation programme, known as &quot;the Library Transformation Project&quot;. The work refurbished the ground floor of the library and created new reception and entrance areas, new music practice rooms, group study rooms and a gallery exhibition space.

SOAS being a constituent college of the University of London, its students also have access to Senate House Library, shared by other colleges such as London School of Economics and University College London, which is located just a short walk from the Russell Square campus.

The library was used as a filming location for some scenes in the 2016 film &quot;Criminal&quot;.

===Rankings===
The 2022 QS World University Rankings placed SOAS 2nd in the world for Development Studies, 10th for Anthropology and 15th for Politics. For Arts &amp; Humanities overall, it was placed 67th in the world by the same rankings. As an institution, it placed 508th overall in the QS World University Rankings 2025, having fallen from a high of 252nd in 2017. SOAS ranked 33rd globally for International Students and 49th for International Faculty in the 2023 QS World University Rankings.

SOAS&#x27;s Department of Financial and Management Studies (DeFiMS) is ranked within the top-60 for Business Studies in the 2023 Complete University Guide&#x27;s League Table. The research strength of the department has been previously recognised by the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF) where 81 per cent was rated as world-leading and internationally excellent, placing it 41st in the country by GPA.

The results of the 2021 REF took the form of profiles spread across four grade levels. Hence, there are different ways to present them and to rank the departments. According to published tables by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, SOAS is ranked 4th by GPA in the UK for Anthropology (an improvement from 16th in the previous exercise in 2014) and 25th in the UK for Development Studies.

===Scholarships, bursaries, and awards===
A range of scholarships and awards support SOAS degree programmes, with an application process based either on academic merit or with a focus on supporting students from specific countries or connected with particular areas of study, as well as some bursaries addressing students&#x27; financial needs.

=== Publications ===
SOAS publishes academic journals such as &quot;The China Quarterly,&quot;&quot;Bulletin of the School of Oriental &amp; African Studies, Journal of African Law,&quot; &quot;South East Asia Research&quot; and &quot;SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research.&quot;

==Student life==

In , there were undergraduate students. In 2012, 41% of students were over 21 and 60% were female. According to the QS World University Rankings, SOAS hosts international students from 140 countries.

SOAS is renowned for its political scene and radical socialist politics and was voted the most politically active university in the UK in the Which? University 2012. Recent campaigns include students for social change, women&#x27;s liberty and justice for cleaners. The SOAS Student Union was established in 1927, and has a long history of activism: campaigning against the introduction of both student loans and later student fees; raising funds for the Algerian victims of the Algerian War of Independence against France in 1959; and successfully campaigning for the school to divest from fossil fuels. The SU bar became an established live music venue by the 1970s and was where Nirvana played their first UK gig in 1989. The SOAS Marxist Society holds frequent events and encourages student voter registration.

Located in the heart of Bloomsbury, many University of London schools and institutes are close by, including Birkbeck, the Institute of Education, London Business School, the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, the Royal Veterinary College, the School of Advanced Study, Senate House Library and University College London.

===Sports===

SOAS has multiple smaller sports teams competing in a variety of local and national leagues, as well as occasional international tournaments. SOAS clubs compete in inter-university fixtures in the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) competition in a range of sports, including basketball, football, hockey, netball, rugby union and tennis. SOAS also participates in an annual North London Varsity tournament against London Metropolitan University.

===On-campus jobs===
Some programs help students to work part-time on campus alongside their full-time study. 
* Education Co-Creator Internship: This is a 64-hour scheme for SOAS undergraduates interested in the education sector. Students work on an innovative project in collaboration with SOAS staff to improve services at their own university.
* Santander Micro-internship: This is a remote 60-hour Santander Universities initiative, targeted towards SOAS students looking to develop an entrepreneurial career. As part of this program, students are typically assigned to a start-up or NGO.
* Student Ambassador: In this job, SOAS students promote their university to high school students.
* Campus Brand Ambassador roles: Depending on availability, students may also take up a job to represent employers such as CMS, Clyde &amp; Co, BDO, Vantage, Dentons, PwC, Barbri, Linklaters, Freshfields, and BCLP on campus. SOAS is not responsible for recruiting for this role – it is the respective external employer or a recruitment agency.

===Student housing===

SOAS operates two halls of residence in central London, both owned by Sanctuary Student Housing.
The primary accommodation for undergraduates is Dinwiddy House, which is located on Pentonville Road. This contains 510 single en-suite rooms arranged in small cluster flats of around six rooms each. The halls are located within minutes of King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station and the Vernon Square campus.

A few minutes walk from Dinwiddy House and also on the Pentonville Road is Paul Robeson House, the second hall of residence. This was opened in 1998, and is named after the African-American musician Paul Robeson who studied at SOAS in the 1930s. This accommodation is occupied by postgraduate students, and those attending the international SOAS Summer schools.

SOAS students are eligible to apply for places in the University of London intercollegiate halls of residence. The majority of these are based in Bloomsbury such as Canterbury Hall, Commonwealth Hall, College Hall, Connaught Hall, Hughes Parry Hall, International Hall and International Students House, while further afield are Nutford House in Marble Arch and Lillian Penson Hall in Paddington. A number of SOAS postgraduate students also apply for student accommodation at Goodenough College. Wood Green Hall is another accommodation in North London that reserves places for SOAS students annually.

<text>Hengelo is a town in the eastern part of The Netherlands, province of Gelderland (not to be confused with the much larger city of Hengelo, Overijssel). The predominantly rural area it is situated in is known as the Achterhoek. Hengelo (Gelderland) is famous for various horse-related activities (markets, horse-jumping, etc.). Once a year a motorbike race takes place just outside the town on a streetcircuit.
It used to be a separate municipality and is now part of the municipality of Bronckhorst.

<doc id="118655" wikidata="Q143289" url="?curid=118655" title="Tabun (nerve agent)">
<text>Tabun (military designation GA) is an extremely toxic compound of the organophosphate family. It is not present in nature. At room temperature, the pure compound is a clear and viscous liquid. However, impurities imparted during its manufacture are almost always present, turning it into a yellow or brown liquid. Exposed to environs, it slowly volatizes into the atmosphere, with the vapor having a slight fruity or almond-like odor. As the compound has a much higher molecular mass (162 g/mol) compared to air, Tabun gas tends to accumulate in low-lying areas.

It is a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, a key enzyme within the human body as well as in other animals. Acetylcholinesterase is responsible for breaking down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft by motor neurons. The presence of acetylcholine within the cleft signals the post-synaptic (downstream) motor neuron to contract the neuron&#x27;s associated muscle fibers, and vice versa. By irreversibly phosphorylating the enzyme, Tabun accomplishes a constant and involuntary contraction of the affected muscles, as the acetylcholine is not recycled and continues to build up within the cleft. Death of the organism ensues when respiratory muscles, such as the diaphragm and intercostals, become exhausted and paralyzed from constant contraction, leading to loss of respiratory functions.

The production and storage of Tabun has been strictly regulated under the Chemical Weapons Convention and its implementing agency OPCW since 1997. As a Schedule 1 Toxic Chemical, the synthesis of more than 100 grams of the substance per year must be declared to the organization, and no signing nation can possess more than 1 ton of the chemical. Modern usage of Tabun is limited to research purposes in minute amounts.

==Chemistry and Synthesis==
===Reactions===
Tabun can be deactivated chemically using common oxidizing agents such as sodium hypochlorite.
===Historic synthesis===
Tabun was made on an industrial scale by Germany during World War II, based on a process developed by Gerhard Schrader. In the chemical agent factory in Dyhernfurth an der Oder, code-named &quot;Hochwerk&quot;, at least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. The manufacturing process consisted of two steps (see below); after the reactions, the mixture (consisting of ~75% solvent, ~25% desired product, plus insoluble salts and reactants) was filtered and vacuum-distilled. This yielded a technical product consisting either of 95% or 80% tabun (then known as Tabun A or B, respectively, the second a product later in the war).

==Effects of exposure==
The symptoms of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The symptoms of exposure are similar to those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Tabun also breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.

The effects of tabun appear slowly when tabun is absorbed through the skin rather than inhaled. A victim may absorb a lethal dose quickly, although death may be delayed for one to two hours. A person&#x27;s clothing can release the toxic chemical for up to 30 minutes after exposure. Inhaled lethal dosages kill in one to ten minutes, and liquid absorbed through the eyes kills almost as quickly. However, people who experience mild to moderate exposure to tabun can recover completely, if treated almost as soon as exposure occurs. The median lethal dose (LD50) for tabun is about 400 mg-min/m3.

The lethal dose for a man is about .01 mg/kg. The median lethal dose for respiration is 400 mg-minute/m3 for humans. Respiratory lethal doses can kill anytime from 1-10 minutes. When the liquid enters the eye, it also can kill just as quickly. When absorbed via the skin, death may occur in 1-2 minutes, or it can take up to 2 hours.

Treatment for suspected tabun poisoning is often three injections of a nerve agent antidote, such as atropine. Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl) also works as an antidote; however, it must be administered within minutes to a few hours following exposure to be effective.

==History==

Research into ethyl dialkylaminocyanophosphonate began in the late 19th century, In 1898, Adolph Schall, a graduate student at the University of Rostock under professor August Michaelis, synthesised the diethylamino analog of tabun, as part of his PhD thesis &quot;Über die Einwirkung von Phosphoroxybromid auf secundäre aliphatische Amine&quot;. However, Schall incorrectly identified the structure of the substance as an imidoether, and Michaelis corrected him in a 1903 article in &quot;Liebigs Annalen&quot;, &quot;Über die organischen Verbindungen des Phosphors mit dem Stickstoff&quot;. The high toxicity of the substance (as well as the high toxicity of its precursors, diethylamidophosphoric dichloride and dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride) wasn&#x27;t noted at the time, most likely due to the low yield of the synthetic reactions used.

Tabun became the first nerve agent known after a property of this chemical was discovered by pure accident in late December 1936 by German researcher Gerhard Schrader. Schrader was experimenting with a class of compounds called organophosphates, which kill insects by interrupting their nervous systems, to create a more effective insecticide for IG Farben, a German chemical and pharmaceutical industry conglomerate, at Elberfeld. The substance he discovered, as well as being a potent insecticide, was enormously toxic to humans; hence, it was named &quot;tabun&quot;, to indicate that the substance was &#x27;taboo&#x27; (German: &quot;tabu&quot;) for its intended purpose.

During World War II, as part of the Grün 3 program, a plant for the manufacture of tabun was established at Dyhernfurth (now Brzeg Dolny, Poland), in 1939. Run by Anorgana GmbH, the plant began production of the substance in 1942. The reason for the delay was the extreme precautions used by the plant. Intermediate products of tabun were corrosive, and had to be contained in quartz or silver-lined vessels. Tabun itself was also highly toxic, and final reactions were conducted behind double glass walls. Large scale manufacturing of the agent resulted in problems with tabun&#x27;s degradation over time, and only 12,753 metric tons were manufactured before the plant was seized by the Soviet Army. The plant initially produced shells and aerial bombs using a 95:5 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene, designated &quot;Variant A&quot;. In the latter half of the war, the plant switched to &quot;Variant B&quot;, an 80:20 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene designed for easier dispersion. The Soviets dismantled the plant and shipped it to Russia.

During the Nuremberg Trials, Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments and War Production for the Third Reich, testified that he had planned to kill Adolf Hitler in early 1945 by introducing tabun into the Führerbunker ventilation shaft. He said his efforts were frustrated by the impracticality of tabun and his lack of ready access to a replacement nerve agent, and also by the unexpected construction of a tall chimney that put the air intake out of reach.

The US once considered repurposing captured German stocks of tabun (GA) prior to production of Sarin (GB). Like the other Allied governments, the Soviets soon abandoned tabun (GA) for Sarin (GB) and Soman (GD). The German magazine Spiegel reported in 2007 that after World War II, &quot;the United States dumped around half a million Tabun bombs in the Skagerrak in the northern Baltic&quot; sea.

Since GA is much easier to produce than the other G-series weapons and the process is comparatively widely understood, countries that develop a nerve agent capability but lack advanced industrial facilities often start by producing GA.

During the Iran–Iraq War of 1980 to 1988, Iraq employed quantities of chemical weapons against Iranian ground forces. Although the most commonly used agents were mustard gas and sarin, tabun and cyclosarin were also used.

Tabun was also used in the 1988 Halabja chemical attack.

Producing or stockpiling tabun was banned by the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. The worldwide stockpiles declared under the convention were 2 tonnes, and as of December 2015 these stockpiles had been destroyed.

<doc id="118657" wikidata="Q5183627" url="?curid=118657" title="Creature Double Feature">
<text>Creature Double Feature is a television show, syndicated in the Boston and Philadelphia area during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. It sometimes also aired under names like Sci-Fi Flix and Creature Feature. The show aired classic monster movies, with the name &quot;Creature Double Feature&quot; based on its airing two movies during its three-hour time slot. The movies broadcast were taken from the classic Universal Horror movies of the 1930s to 1950s, the Hammer Studios and American International Pictures films of the 1950s, Roger Corman&#x27;s horror films of the 1960s, and Toho Studio&#x27;s &quot;giant monster&quot; (known in Japanese as either kaiju or tokusatsu) movies of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.

==Air times==
Creature Double Feature usually aired on Saturday afternoons. Because it aired after the traditional Saturday morning cartoon time block, it introduced many younger viewers to classic (and not-so-classic) monster movies. In other cities it aired either on Friday night or Saturday night.

===Boston===
Beginning in 1972 a station in the Kaiser Broadcasting (later Field Communications) chain, WKBG (Channel 56; WLVI after &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; sold their share back to Kaiser in 1975) aired its collection of &quot;Godzilla&quot; movies—one per week at 4 p.m. on Saturday under the title, &quot;The 4 O&#x27;Clock Movie&quot;. They cycled through their collection twice, noticing that the broadcasts were especially popular with youngsters. Then, they started showing the films at midnight, calling it &quot;Creature Feature&quot;. The ratings became so popular that the show was moved to noon to increase its ratings. However, it was in direct competition with WCVB-TV&#x27;s &quot;Candlepin Bowling&quot; and was moved to the 2 p.m. time slot. Its popularity grew and they tweaked the title to &quot;Creature Double Feature&quot; and changed its start time to 1 p.m. The show quickly became a staple of the station&#x27;s Saturday programming schedule during the 1970s and early-1980s. Although the exact date of the final show is currently unknown, it seems to have petered out sometime in 1983 and was replaced with WLVI-TV&#x27;s &quot;Martial Arts Theater&quot;, showing cheap English-dubbed Hong Kong martial arts movies, as a replacement.

To this day WLVI staffers report that they still receive more e-mail and phone calls about &quot;Creature Double Feature&quot; than anything else. In 2006, Channel 56&#x27;s Steve Ratner was quoted in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; as saying &quot;I&#x27;m amazed at the following the show continues to have. It&#x27;s just insane how many people come up to us and ask after the &quot;Creature Double Feature&quot;. Every day we get e-mails from people all over the country.&quot; However, the station is unlikely to revive the show on their own since that timeslot is usually used now for infomercials, from which the station makes a considerable amount of income. The main announcer on &quot;Creature Double Feature&quot; was a Channel 56 long-time booth announcer, Neil MacNevin. His radio/TV name was Tom Evans. He and an engineer named Press Campbell would create sound effects, echoes, wind etc. off the cuff during the weekly recording sessions for the movie and promos for &quot;CDF&quot; during the week. MacNevin says he still gets comments from some of the listeners from those days and really enjoys telling them about the sessions. MacNevin and Campbell retired from broadcasting in the early nineties.

In June 2006, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reported that Boston-area car dealership owner Ernie Boch Jr. would be bringing the show back to WLVI—in its original timeslot—on an occasional basis. The first program of the new series aired on June 24, 2006. The two films shown on this occasion were &quot;Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster&quot; and &quot;The Giant Gila Monster&quot;. Boch himself hosted the show in full makeup as The Ghoul, though the original show almost never had a host—only announcers (other than for a brief time when Rich Koz, the Son of Svengoolie out of Chicago, hosted the CDF in the early &#x27;80s). A second episode aired on October 28, 2006, featuring 1973&#x27;s &quot;Horror Express&quot; followed by the original 1968 &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. It was brought back again on October 27, 2007 with the American International Pictures&#x27; (A.I.P.) movies &quot;Gammera the Invincible&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Gamera&quot;) and &quot;Attack of the Monsters&quot;. The broadcast contained no pop-up ads during the films and no interruptions from any on-air talent personnel during commercial breaks. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Sunday Edition of their TV guide printed the schedule of the two Gamera movie titles reversed in their time slots.

The show&#x27;s original announcers were reportedly Ron Dwyer and Tom Evans. During most of its run in its later years, the show&#x27;s announcer was Dale Dorman aka &quot;Uncle Dale&quot;, a Boston radio personality at WRKO and at WXKS-FM who also frequently did voice work for 56&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming.

The intro/outro music used for &quot;Creature Double Feature&quot; throughout its run was Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Toccata&quot; from &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;. WLVI has kept the song as the theme of the 2006 and 2007 revival. It is not yet known if current WLVI owners Sunbeam Television will continue to air the revival.

===Philadelphia===
In the Philadelphia area, another Kaiser/Field station, WKBS Channel 48, aired this program between 1976 and 1979 after the success the show had in Boston. Two of the most popular films included &quot;Attack of the Mushroom People&quot; and &quot;Tourist Trap&quot;.

<text>Amerongen () is a town in the municipality of Utrechtse Heuvelrug in the province of Utrecht, Netherlands, on the border of the Utrecht Hill Ridge. It lies about 7 km (4.3 mi) southwest of Veenendaal (10.5 km or 6.5 mi by road).

The landscape rises from the flat water meadows of the Nederrijn (Lower Rhine) to the Utrecht Hill Ridge (&quot;Utrechtse Heuvelrug&quot;). The highest point in the western Netherlands is located 2 km east of the village. The Amerongense Berg (Amerongen Mountain) has a height of 69 metres above sea level.

== History ==
The history of Amerongen is closely related to that of Amerongen Castle. This castle was first established in 1286 as a wooden donjon but was rebuilt in stone. It was damaged or destroyed by fire and rebuilt several times during the following centuries. In 1672 the Netherlands were invaded by the French army and in early 1673, the castle was deliberately burned down as a punishment for non-payment of taxes levied by the French. Shortly afterwards the castle was rebuilt, under the capable supervision of Margaretha Turnor, wife of Van Reede, owner of the castle and special envoy to the court of Brandenburg at this time. The newly built and extended castle arose in the Dutch Classicist style. Although the grounds and gardens were remodelled at various times and the interior brought up to date by Pierre Cuypers in the early 20th century, it remains a prime example of this style. 

The former Emperor of Germany, Wilhelm II, sought refuge in the Netherlands in November 1918 after the First World War. He lived in the castle until May 1920, when he moved to nearby Doorn, where he spent the rest of his life. It was in the Castle of Amerongen that he signed the Act of Abdication.

Until January 1, 2006, Amerongen was a separate municipality, which covered the village of Amerongen itself, Overberg, and the western part of the village of Elst. Elst was transferred to the municipality of Rhenen; the largest part of the municipality has merged with four other municipalities to form the new municipality of Utrechtse Heuvelrug.

In 2021, the village of Amerongen had 6.985 inhabitants. In 2001, the built-up area of the village was 1.21 km2, and contained 2072 residences.

&quot;Amerongen&quot;, &quot;Van Amerongen&quot; and &quot;Van Nieuw Amerongen&quot; are surnames that indicate that their ancestors originated from this area.

==Economics==

Amerongen had a tobacco industry until the 19th century. The downfall of the tobacco industry was caused by the rise of cigar consumption, to which the tobacco from Amerongen was not suited. The foreign tobacco market also contributed to the downfall of the local tobacco industry. In 1879 the local Earl of Amerongen, Aldenburgh Bentinck, tried to revive the local economy by opening a cream factory in 1890. However, the factory had to close in 1912 and he then insisted the village on growing tulips. However, the domestic Dutch market proved too strong for the village and the production was stopped. In a last effort the Earl insisted on building hop-yards to grow hops, however this plan failed too. The majority of the villagers therefore became dependent on jobs in neighboring villages.

The factory of Technivorm, the producer of the Moccamaster coffee machine, is situated in Amerongen.

===Transportation===

The village of Amerongen is served by one bus line, namely line 50 to Utrecht and back to Veenendaal and Wageningen. The village was served by a tram from 9 November 1884 until 1949, which went from Zeist to Arnhem. The tram itself was electrified in 1922, before it was electrified the tramline was used by steamtrams. The increase of the amount of autobusses contributed to the downfall of the tram in Amerongen, on which operations with the tram ceased in 1949. There are no tram tracks left in the village.

<text>Doorn is a town in the municipality of Utrechtse Heuvelrug in the central Netherlands, in the province of Utrecht. The town is famous for being the final residence of Wilhelm II.

== History == 
In a document from 885 to 896 the settlement is called &quot;Thorhem&quot;, a dwelling of Thor, the god of thunder. Vikings quartered at Dorestad (now Wijk bij Duurstede) reportedly referred to the place as Thorhem, as the god of thunder was worshipped there. Archaeological excavations on a moor at the estate of Hoog Moersbergen, north of Doorn, have revealed evidence of a pagan sacrificial site.

Later, the settlement of Thorhem became part of the homestead known as Villa Thorhem. Around 1200, this homestead was in the possession of a provost of the Bishopric of Utrecht. One of his successors built a castle in the 14th century – now known as Huis Doorn – and established the Maartenskerk (&quot;St. Martin&#x27;s Church&quot;) around 1200. The church was extended in the 15th century and later passed into Protestant hands around 1585, remaining in use as a Protestant church. Another castle, Kasteel Moersbergen, was first mentioned in 1435 and has undergone several alterations since the 17th century. The expansive estate around Huis Doorn left little room for town expansion until 1874, when the estate was parcelled out. After World War II, the town experienced significant growth and today it also hosts a major base for the Royal Dutch Marines. Nearby is the Von Gimborn Arboretum, one of the botanical garden sites of Utrecht University. Doorn was an independent municipality until 1 January 2006, after which it became the principal town in the municipality of Utrechtse Heuvelrug. The town also supports its own football club, DEV Doorn.

== Famous inhabitants == 
The last German Emperor, Wilhelm II of Germany, lived at Castle Doorn (Huis Doorn) in the center of the village after his deposition in 1918. Although he initially regarded his exile as humiliating, he gradually found solace in Doorn’s tranquility and personally oversaw the gardens, remaining active in following political developments until his death in 1941.

Dutch novelist Simon Vestdijk resided in Doorn for much of his life (1939–1971, with brief intervals elsewhere). His works reflect the peaceful yet introspective atmosphere of the village.

Dutch writer Maarten Maartens had a small castle built in Doorn—Zonheuvel (&quot;Sun Hill,&quot; completed in 1903). Today, the castle is known as Maarten Maartenshuis and forms part of the hotel and conference center Zonheuvel.

<text>Eemnes () is a municipality and a village in the Netherlands, in the province of Utrecht.

== The town of Eemnes ==

Eemnes formerly consisted of two villages, Eemnes-Binnen (&quot;Inner Eemnes&quot;) and Eemnes-Buiten (&quot;Outer Eemnes&quot;). These names referred to the location of the villages with respect to the dyke of the river Eem.

Eemnes-Buiten received city rights in 1345; Eemnes-Binnen was granted city rights in 1439.

&quot;Dutch topographic map of the municipality of Eemnes, June 2015&quot;

== Pools ==
Until 1932, when the Afsluitdijk sealed off the Zuiderzee from the North Sea, the weak dykes in this part of the country would occasionally break during storms. This resulted in the formation of pools, which in Dutch are called &quot;&quot;waaien&quot; or &quot;wielen&quot;&quot;. Because they could be tens of meters in diameter and several metres deep, landowners often did not make the effort of filling them up. Because they symbolize man&#x27;s battle against the sea and are relatively rare, provincial authorities designated them &quot;geological monuments&quot; in June 2005.

== Notable people ==
* Johannes Gijsbertus de Casparis (1916 in Eemnes – 2002) was a Dutch orientalist and Indologist 
* Roland van Benthem (born 1968 in Emmeloord) a Dutch politician and is the current mayor of Eemnes since 2005.

== Notable events ==
* 14 December 1917: Coastal class airship C.26 crash

== Notable Places ==
* Het Huis Van Eemnes (a big building where there are gymnasiums that the local schools use, and also where a lot of events happen.
* De Minnhof (basically just where most of the shops are including the Lidl and the Plus(former Coop).
* De Eemnesser Polder (the polder of Eemnes, it makes up abot 80-90% of Eemnes and can look really cool when there is mist for example.

== Fun Facts ==
* Eemnes is the most reachable town/city in The Netherlands according to VPRO in the program Nederland van boven

<doc id="118669" wikidata="Q10044" url="?curid=118669" title="Houten">
<text>Houten () is a municipality in the Netherlands, in the province of Utrecht.

==Population centres==
The municipality consists of the following towns:
* &#x27;t Goy
* Houten
* Schalkwijk
* Tull en &#x27;t Waal

===Houten (town)===
The main town in the municipality is Houten, a commuter town about 9 km southeast of Utrecht. On 1 January 2020, the town had 50,177 inhabitants (municipality). The built-up area was in area, and contained 20,010 residences in 2018. The slightly larger statistical district of Houten had a population of about 39,100 in 2004.

== History of Houten ==
Remains of a Roman villa have been found in the old centre of Houten, made visible in a street pattern. These remains were discovered in the 1950s.

In the Dark Ages, Houten took shape as a rural centre. The area of the municipality of Houten was divided in the so-called &quot;gerechten&quot; (&quot;districts&quot;), the names of which are still in use: Schonauwen, Wulven, Waijen, Heemstede.

Many elements of present-day Houten are remnants of its history. Prominent in the old centre (&quot;Het Oude Dorp&quot;, &quot;The Old Town&quot;) are the Roman Catholic Church (1884) and the Protestant Church (1563). The first accounts of the older church date from the ninth century; the oldest parts of the present church building are probably from the eleventh century. Another prominent building is the restaurant-cafe &quot;De Engel&quot; (&quot;The Angel&quot;), already mentioned in the 16th century as a tavern.

Former access roads to the old centre are still recognisable by their names, such as the &quot;Odijkseweg&quot; and &quot;Loerikseweg&quot;. Houten had many orchards, but few have survived.

=== The expanding city 1966–1998 ===

Modern Houten started to take shape late in the 20th century (1966–1998). It was first designated by the office of Wissing-Derks as a &quot;Groeikern&quot; -– a centre of growth –- to meet the needs of the growing city of Utrecht. From the beginning, urban planner-designer Robert Derks was involved with the development of New Town Houten. Construction of 10,000 new dwellings began in 1979, and the population grew from 4,000 to more than 30,000 by the end of the century.
=== Second designation as a centre of urban growth 1992–2015 ===

By 2015, some 7,000 new houses had been built in Houten-Zuid, following the same urban design principles as in the existing northern part of Houten, with some differences. The body of water to the east is large in comparison with water bodies in the old parts of Houten. The pentagonal green zone in Houten-Zuid embracing the centre is different from the green zone in Houten-Noord, which runs through the whole city in a linear structure, crossing the new city centre and with larger parks at either end. Another difference is that in some places cars share the road with bicycle paths (this concept was later applied in the northern part as well). The southern part was also designed by Robert Derks and his office for urban design Stedebouw BV.

== Transport ==

=== Rail ===
Houten has two railway stations, Houten (opened in 1868, closed in 1934, re-opened on a different location in 1982 and restructured in 2010) and Houten Castellum (opened in 2010). These stations are served by local commuter trains to Utrecht (northbound) and Geldermalsen (southbound, with subsequent connections to Tiel and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch/Breda). The railway has been doubled from two tracks to four, to accommodate for an extra stop at Castellum with a frequency of four trains per hour in each direction.

=== Bus ===
Busses travel to regional destinations, such as Nieuwegein and Utrecht.

=== Bike ===
Like most Dutch cities, Houten is well adapted to the high number of cyclists. Unlike other cities Houten is built around a system of car-free public space combined with the infrastructure for slow traffic. The design principle of separating cycling and walking from car traffic has been pushed to the limit. Houten is unique in this. Cycling comfort and safety are extremely high (optimal), even by Dutch standards. A large network of bike paths makes it convenient to cycle to various destinations and within the town the bike is the most popular means of transport.

On 29 October 2008 Houten was chosen as &quot;Fietsstad 2008&quot; — the top BikeCity of the Netherlands for 2008. The same happened on 16 January 2018, when Houten was praised for its best all round cycling characteristics and again voted the best &quot;Fietsstad 2018&quot; — the nations top BikeCity for 2018. Since the first bicycle city election (held every two years) in 2002 Houten is the only one that managed to win the title twice. The city of Houten is known as, nationally and internationally, and in growing interest from home and abroad, as the worlds best practical example for bicycle friendliness. A growing number of groups with politicians, developers, designers and students visit cycling city Houten for study purposes and inspiration.

=== Car ===
To the west, Houten has its own exit from the A27 motorway, and the N409 (single carriageway with bus lane) runs from Houten to Nieuwegein. To the east and south, there are only local roads, not designed for through traffic. A connection to the A12 motorway to the north is the N421 (single carriageway).

The only way to get from one district to another is via the ring road which circles around Houten, thus preventing through traffic in residential areas. Maximum speed on most of the ring road is .

== Urban planning and architecture ==

=== Sustainable urban design ===
Houten is internationally known for its urban design. Because of the city structure, people are encouraged to travel by bike and train.
Distinctive qualities of Houten include the accessibility of the railway station, green and water zones throughout the whole city, numerous soccer and basketball fields, high standard of accommodation for different groups and the child-friendly bicycle paths. It is one of the safest cities in the Netherlands. Cyclists and cars are able to avoid each other: an extensive network of bicycle tracks connects the different districts of the town, while cars have to go to the city ring road before they can go to another part of the city.

Thomas House is a small-scale housing complex in Houten for adults with intellectual disabilities, opened in 2013.

=== Remarkable buildings in Houten ===

* Aluminiumcentre &quot;Aluminium wood&quot; (Micha de Haas)

<text>IJsselstein () is a municipality and city in the Netherlands, in the province of Utrecht. IJsselstein received city rights in 1331. IJsselstein owes its name to the river Hollandse IJssel which flows through the city. It is a major commuting suburb for the Utrecht area, along with the neighbouring towns Houten and Nieuwegein (in part due to the &quot;Sneltram&quot; light rail line serving the area). It is surrounded by the municipalities of Utrecht, Montfoort, Lopik, Vijfheerenlanden and Nieuwegein.

==Sights==

The city has an old town, surrounded by a small canal. A castle stood in IJsselstein from 1300 to 1888; the tower survived. The city has two large churches, both named after St. Nicholas: the Dutch Reformed Nicolaas church, founded in 1310, and a Roman Catholic church. Inside the Protestant church there are two mausoleums; one of the family of Gijsbrecht van Amstel (1350) and another of (1475). The catholic basilica of St. Nicolaas dates from 1887 and is neo-Gothic. It was given the title of &#x27;Basilica Minor&#x27; by Pope Paul VI in 1972.

A 366.8 metres high television mast, called the Gerbrandy Tower, is located in IJsselstein. The tower is commonly, and erroneously, referred to as &quot;Zendmast Lopik&quot;, after the nearby village of Lopik.

<text>Leersum is a town in the municipality of Utrechtse Heuvelrug in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It lies about 7 km (4.3 mi) east of Doorn and 9 km (5.5 mi) west of Veenendaal.

In 2001, the town of Leersum had 6013 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 1.44 km2; it contained 2465 residences. Until 2006, Leersum was its own municipality, covering both the town of Leersum and neighbouring Darthuizen.

In June 2021, Leersum was hit by a downburst. Many cars and homes were heavily damaged by falling trees. As a result, the forests around Leersum have been closed. Staatsbosbeheer, the Dutch state forest administration, estimates that damaged sections of forest will not be reopened to the general public before the end of the year 2021.

<text>Leusden () is a municipality and a town in the Netherlands, in the province of Utrecht. It is located about 3 kilometres southeast of Amersfoort.

The western part of the municipality lies on the slopes of the Utrecht Hill Ridge and is largely covered by forest and heathlands. The eastern parts lie in the and are mostly agricultural.

Former Amersfoort concentration camp lies just within the northern municipal border with Amersfoort.

== Population centres ==

The municipality of Leusden contains four villages:

* Leusden, originally named &quot;Hamersveld&quot; and later &quot;Leusden-Centrum&quot;;
* Leusden-Zuid, formerly &quot;Leusbroek&quot;
* Achterveld
* Stoutenburg

There are also a number of hamlets in the municipality: 
== The town of Leusden ==
The place that is now called Leusden was first mentioned as &quot;Villa Lisiduna&quot; in a charter in 777. The exact location of that settlement, which is considered to have been a rather extensive farm complex with defenses, is unknown to us. It is possible that the old village of Oud-Leusden once was the location of Villa Lisiduna but excavations in the 1980s have not provided any evidence. However, the church tower of Oud-Leusden is one of the oldest towers in the Netherlands, dating back at least to the 11th century A.D. Close to Leusden is the site of the former monastery Heiligenberg, founded around the year 1000 by bishop Ansfridus of Utrecht, who died here in 1010.

In the 1970s, the agricultural villages of Leusbroek and Hamersveld grew together into a larger, mainly residential town. What once was Hamersveld is now called Leusden-Centrum, now commonly Leusden, and Leusbroek was to become Leusden-Zuid. In the original plans, Leusden was to grow into a town of around 46,000 inhabitants. After the initial expansion there was a growing resistance from the population, so some of the later phases of expansion have been abandoned.

== History ==

During the pentacost weekend of 1924, the municipality housed the first ever Pinksterlanddagen also known as &quot;Landdag voor anarchistische jongeren&quot; (Land-day for anarchist youth). It was held on a terrain on the &#x27;dode weg&#x27; owned by the municipality of Amersfoort.

== Shopping areas ==
In Leusden there are 3 main shopping areas:

1) &quot;De Hamershof&quot;, located in the center near the town hall, with almost 90 stores. The oldest part opened in 1980 together with the Town Hall. It was renovated in 2018

2) &quot;De Biezenkamp&quot;, north of Hamershof, with around 20 shops. The biggest market of the town takes place here every Tuesday. Modernization took place in 2016 and onwards, including new apartments that were built in the area.

3) &quot;De Zuidhoek&quot; opened in 2012 in Leusden-Zuid, to accommodate the people living in the new neighborhood &quot;de Tabaksteeg&quot;

== Notable residents ==

* Gerrit Achterberg (1905-1962 in Leusden) a poet 
* Arleen Auger (1939-1993 in Leusden) an American soprano 
* Robby Valentine (born 1968 in Leusden) singer and multi-instrumentalist
* Marieke Wijsman (born 1975 in Leusden) former speed-skater, competed at the 1988 and 2002 Winter Olympics 
* Marike Jager (born 1979) a Dutch singer-songwriter, guitarist and TV presenter, grew up in Leusden
* Haike van Stralen (born 1983 in Leusden) a Dutch former freestyle swimmer, who competed at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics

<text>Lopik () is a municipality and a town in the Netherlands, in the province of Utrecht, close to the Lek river.

== History ==
Lopik lies within the Lopikerwaard region, which used to be occupied by swamps and forests until the area was cultivated in the eleventh century. Lopik was first mentioned as &quot;Lobeke&quot; in 1155 CE. Most of the population settled along the canals that were used for transport and drainage (and which are still used for the latter purpose). It was not until after World War II that villages in the area were expanded beyond the original ribbons of buildings, and Lopik remains a well-known example of a linear settlement within the Netherlands.

In the Netherlands, &quot;Lopik&quot; is often used as a reference to the broadcasting facilities located in the eastern part of the municipality and in neighbouring IJsselstein. These include the Gerbrandy Tower, a structure that is the tallest structure in the Netherlands, and the world&#x27;s largest Christmas tree during the period around Christmas.

== Geography ==
The entire municipality lies within the Dutch Green Heart and has a rural character. The two main access roads are the N210 and N204 provincial roads, which connect the area with major cities that include Rotterdam and Utrecht. The river Lek lies behind a high dike, which is visible from most of the south of the Lopik municipality. In the end of the eighties and early nineties the dike was strengthened and extra height was added in preparation for increasingly high water levels. Ambitious planning for continued improvement to the dikes continues.

=== Population centres ===
The municipality of Lopik consists of the following towns, villages and/or districts:

<text>Nieuwegein () is a municipality and city in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is bordered on the north by the city of Utrecht, the provincial capital. It is separated from Vianen to the south by the river Lek and borders on IJsselstein in the southwest and Houten in the east. Nieuwegein has 64,606 inhabitants as of 1 December 2021.

Several national sports federations are housed in Nieuwegein, including the NeVoBo (volleyball), KNZB (swimming), NBb (basketball) and KNCB (cricket).

There are three main secondary schools in the city, including the Anna van Rijn College, Oosterlicht College and the Cals College.

==History==
Nieuwegein was founded on 1 July 1971 as a planned city, following the merger of the former municipalities of Jutphaas and Vreeswijk. The new town was built for the expanding population of the city of Utrecht, and grew rapidly during the decades following its foundation. 

In the area between Jutphaas and Vreeswijk there used to be a settlement called Geyne (Gein). This settlement received city rights in 1295 but was destroyed in 1333, in a war between the Bishop of Utrecht and the Count of Holland. Today only Oudegein House remains from that time. After the boards of Vreeswijk and Jutphaas had debated for some time about the name of the new municipality, they decided to name it after this old settlement - Nieuwegein meaning &#x27;New Gein&#x27;.

==Population==
===Demographics===
As of 2016, 50.7% of the population consider themselves religious. The largest denomination are Catholics, which are 27.5% of the population, followed by various Protestant denominations (23.8%), and Islam (5.3%). 14.3% of the Nieuwegein population attends religious service regularly.

===Social characteristics &amp; issues===
As of 2017, Nieuwegein has a poverty rate of 4.7% compared to the 5.7% national average.

==Transportation==
Nieuwegein is surrounded by three motorways (Dutch: &quot;autosnelweg&quot;), the A2 to the west, the A12 to the north and the A27 to the east.

Nieuwegein is connected to Utrecht and IJsselstein by the &quot;Sneltram&quot; (light rail) line. There is a pedestrian ferry across the river Lek to Vianen. Three canals flow through Nieuwegein: the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal, the Lek River and the Merwede Canal. There are also a few sports clubs in Nieuwegein, such as: KV Koveni, SV Geinoord, VSV Vreeswijk and JSV Nieuwegein.

==Buildings==
In Nieuwegein, there is a mandi (Mandaean temple) called &quot;Vereniging Mandi van de Mandeeërs Gemeenschap in Nederland&quot;.

==Twin towns==
* Puławy, Lublin Voivodeship, Poland, was a twin town of Nieuwegein from 1994 to 2020. In July 2020, after Puławy installed a gay-free zone, Nieuwegein ended the partnership.
* Rundu, Kavango East Region, Namibia, is a twin town of Nieuwegein since 1994. Because of the current state of gay rights in Namibia, the city council is debating on continuing the partnership.

<doc id="118679" wikidata="Q10051" url="?curid=118679" title="Oudewater">
<text>Oudewater () is a municipality and a city in the Netherlands.

== History ==
The origin of the town of Oudewater is obscure and no information has been found concerning the first settlement of citizens. It is also difficult to recover the name of Oudewater. One explanation is that the name is a corruption of &quot;old water-meadow&quot;. Oudewater was an important border city between Holland and Utrecht. Oudewater (lit. &quot;Old water&quot;) was of great strategic importance.

The town was granted city rights in 1265 by Hendrik van Vianden, the bishop of Utrecht.

Oudewater took its place in the First Free States council in Dordrecht on 19 July 1572, Oudewater was one of the twelve cities taking part in the first free convention of the States General in Dordrecht. This was a meeting that laid down the origin of the State of the Netherlands, as we know it now, under the leadership of the House of Orange. This happened at the beginning of the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648) when the Netherlands were still part of the Spanish Empire. After a Siege of Oudewater, the city was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed, including the family of famous Oudewater native and Protestant theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560-1609).

In the 16th and 17th century, Oudewater was an important producer of rope. In the surrounding area, hemp was cultivated. There still is a rope manufacturing plant and a rope museum in the town.

In 1970 the municipality of Oudewater moved from the province of South Holland to the province of Utrecht.

== Geography ==
Oudewater is located at in the southwest of the province of Utrecht in the center of the Netherlands. It is situated where the Linschoten river flows out in the Hollandse IJssel.

Oudewater is bordered by the municipalities of Montfoort (in the northeast), Lopik (southeast), Krimpenerwaard (southwest), and Bodegraven-Reeuwijk (northwest).

The municipality of Oudewater consists of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: Diemerbroek, Hekendorp, Hoenkoop, Lange Linschoten, Oudewater, Papekop, Ruigeweide, and Snelrewaard.

== Buildings ==

Oudewater is famous for the &quot;Heksenwaag&quot; (Witches&#x27; scales). The weighing house, an official town building, became famous at the height of the European witch trials of the 16th century because people accused of witchcraft were offered a fair chance to prove their innocence, unlike in many other places, where the scales were rigged. 

From all over Europe, people made the journey to Oudewater to avoid prosecution. After the weighing, they received an official certificate proclaiming them not a witch. Nobody was ever found to be an actual witch in Oudewater, though the weighings were still a public spectacle. Certificates would state that &quot;the body weight is in proportion to its build&quot;. The reasoning behind this is the old belief that a witch has no soul and therefore weighs significantly less than an ordinary person; this distinction would supposedly allow the witch to fly on a broomstick. 

The weighings can be seen as a sign of the growing power of the citizenry as a third force next to that of the church and nobility. In giving out these certificates, the citizens of Oudewater, therefore, were defying the church.

The Waag is still open as a tourist attraction, and official certificates are available. 

The town hall dates from 1588 and features a stork&#x27;s nest. Oudewater has a monumental protected city centre with more than 250 protected houses. The church, now Protestant, dates from the 15th century. Its tower is from about 1300. During the religious wars, until the sacking of Oudewater, both Roman Catholics and Protestants used this church. Thereafter Catholics were still tolerated (the Spanish occupiers being Catholic) but more in low profile.

== In fiction ==

Oudewater is the setting for the 1975 novel &quot;Das Geheimnis des Baron Oudewater&quot; set in the 16th century, when the Netherlands was fighting for its independence from Spain. Written by the German author Alberta Rommel, it has been described as a romantic historical novel.

The 2014 film &quot;Reckless&quot; was filmed in Oudewater.

<text>Rhenen () is a municipality and a city in the central Netherlands.
The municipality also includes the villages of Achterberg, , Elst and . The town lies at a geographically interesting location, namely on the southernmost part of the chain of hills known as the Utrecht Hill Ridge (Utrechtse Heuvelrug), where this meets the river Rhine. Because of this Rhenen has a unique character with quite some elevation through town.

Directly to the east of the built-up area lies the Grebbeberg, a hill with a top elevation of about .

== History ==

=== Before 1900 ===
Rhenen received city rights probably between 1256 and 1258. In 1346, the bishop of Utrecht ordered the construction of a defensive wall around the city, which was important because it lay near the border with Guelders. Although for some time the town collected toll from ships on the Rhine, it has never had a harbour. The three city gates were demolished in 1840. Small fragments of the wall remain.

The town is also famous for the Cunera Church, parts of which date back to the 15th century. Containing the relics of Saint Cunera, it attracted many pilgrims. Legend has it that Cunera was buried on a nearby hill now called the Cuneraheuvel. The church&#x27;s tower was built between 1492 and 1531.

Between 1630 and 1631, the Koningshuis palace was constructed at Rhenen for the ousted Frederick V. It was demolished in 1812.

=== World War II ===
Part of the center of Rhenen, which was located near the defensive Grebbelinie (Grebbe line), was destroyed during the German attack on the Netherlands in May 1940. Part of the reconstruction took place during the war. In 1945, the town was damaged again during the liberation of the country from German occupation.

Many or all of the Dutch soldiers who were killed by the Germans near Rhenen lie buried at the &quot;Erebegraafplaats&quot; (Cemetery of Honor), located along the Grebbeweg (N 225) near the top of the Grebbeberg. Across the road is an important war monument with a poem by J.C. Bloem.

In 2008 Rhenen celebrated its 750th anniversary.

<text>Veenendaal () is a municipality and a town in central Netherlands, located in the province of Utrecht. Veenendaal is the only population centre within its administrative borders. The municipality had a population of 70.000 inhabitants on 8 august 2024 and covers an area of .

==History==
The original village was founded in the middle of the 16th century as a peat colony from which it got its name. &quot;Veen&quot; is the Dutch word for fen and &quot;daal&quot; for dale. 

The village was administratively part of two nearby towns, which were themselves part of two different provinces of the Dutch Republic. The southern half belonged to Rhenen in Utrecht, the northeastern half to Ede in Guelders. In 1795, with the arrival of French troops in the country and inspired by the ideas of the French Revolution, the citizens declared their independence. When turmoil of the Napoleonic era was settled and the Netherlands was reformed as a monarchy, only the southern part would retain its independence. 

In the 19th century, wool and tobacco industry became Veenendaal&#x27;s largest source of income. Big factories dominated the otherwise small rural town.

In 1855, Veenendaal was hit by a flood, which caused many residents to flee to Utrecht. A monument was erected near the railway station.

In 1960 the northern part of town, still controlled by Ede, was merged with the self-governing part of town. Further lands of Rhenen and also Renswoude were ceded to allow for new housing developments. The population grew rapidly from about 10,000 in the 1920s, to 23,000 in 1960, to the 68,000+ inhabitants of today. 

In 1997 the town was elected the greenest city in Europe and in 2004 of the Netherlands.

Like most Dutch cities, Veenendaal is well adapted to the high number of cyclists. A large network of bike paths make it convenient to cycle to various destinations and within the town, the bike is a popular mean of transportation. In 2000 and 2020, Veenendaal was chosen as &quot;Fietsstad&quot; of the year, recognised as being the top city for cycling in the Netherlands.

==Religion==
The city is known for being one of the bigger cities within the Dutch Bible Belt (together with Ede and Kampen), as it is inhabited by a considerable number (though not a majority) of conservative Protestants.

<text>Vianen () is a city and a former municipality in the central Netherlands, in the province of Utrecht. It is located south of the Lek river. Before 2002 it was part of the province of South Holland. Vianen is made up of a historic town centre that dates back to the medieval period and was once surrounded by a defensive wall (parts of which still stand today) and moat, as well as more extensive modern housing developments to the east, south and southwest and an industrial and commercial area. Vianen is intersected by two major motorways leading to the city of Utrecht: the A2 (Amsterdam-Maastricht) and the A27 (Breda-Almere).
The municipality was merged with the municipalities of Leerdam and Zederik on 1 January 2019. The name of the new municipality is Vijfheerenlanden which is part of the Utrecht province.

== The city of Vianen ==

Vianen received city rights in 1337. Vianen thrived under the counts of Brederode, who acquired its lordship through marriage early in the 15th century. It formed a self-proclaimed sovereign seignory till 1795, including Vianen, Lexmond, Hei- en Boeicop and Meerkerk. During the Middle Ages, as a &quot;free city,&quot; Vianen could be a haven for felons and escaped serfs. Of the three castles built during the town&#x27;s history, Batestein Castle was said to be one of the most beautiful in the Netherlands. Its only remnants are a 17th-century brick gate and water-pump. Remnants of the old city wall are visible girdling parts of the old downtown.

Vianen celebrates its city rights every year in October with a traditional horse market. Besides the horses there are also other activities on this day, such as a fair and market and traditional Dutch games.

==Notable residents==
* Frans van Brederode (1465 - 1490), military leader
* Nicolaas Heinsius the Elder (1620 - 1681), classical scholar and diplomat
* Marie Adrienne Françoise de Noailles, Marquise de La Fayette (1759–1807), married to French General Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. Lived in Vianen in 1799, when her husband was released from imprisonment in Prussia but was not allowed to return to France.
* Marian van de Wal (born 1970), singer
* Jeannette Lewin (born 1972), hockey player
* Ridouan Taghi (born 1977), Moroccan-Dutch criminal, lived in Vianen during his childhood before becoming a leader of the Moroccan mafia.
* Joaquín Martínez (1930 - 2012), Mexican-born film and television actor, lived in Everdingen

<text>Wijk bij Duurstede () is a municipality and a city in the central Netherlands.

== Population centres ==
*Cothen
*Langbroek
*Wijk bij Duurstede

===Topography===
&quot;Dutch Topographic map of the municipality of Wijk bij Duurstede, 2013.&quot;

== City ==
The city (population as of 2007: 23,377) is located on the Rhine. At Wijk bij Duurstede, the Kromme Rijn (Crooked Rhine) branches off, and the main branch is called Lek River downstream from Wijk bij Duurstede.

The name &#x27;Wijk bij Duurstede&#x27; means &#x27;Neighbourhood by Duurstede&#x27;. Duurstede is the name of the nearby castle/ruin, also called Dorestad, where the bishop of Utrecht used to live. Wijk bij Duurstede is the former location of Dorestad, an important Frisian trade settlement during Carolingian times that was pillaged around 850 by the Vikings.

Wijk bij Duurstede has the only drive-through wind mill in the world. The mill is often confused with the mill that was made famous by Ruisdael&#x27;s 1670 painting &quot;The windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede&quot;, but that mill no longer exists (its foundations can still be seen a couple of blocks away from the remaining mill). At the market place of Wijk bij Duurstede is one of the few church towers in the Netherlands with a flat roof, as built because the bishop could not afford to build a spire. Inside the tower a picture displays the planned construction of the tower. The tower was supposed to become higher than the Domtoren in Utrecht.

Wijk bij Duurstede received city rights in 1300.

== Notable people ==
* Rorik of Dorestad (ca.810– ca.880) Danish Viking who ruled over parts of Frisia 841-873
* Dirck van Baburen (ca.1595–1624) painter of the Utrecht School 
* Thomas van Rhee (1634–1701) colonial administrator, 13th Governor of Dutch Ceylon

<text>Woerden () is a city and a municipality in central Netherlands. Due to its central location between Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht, and the fact that it has rail and road connections to those cities, it is a popular town for commuters who work in those cities.

== History ==
The river Oude Rijn used to flow through the city center of Woerden, but in 1960 the old river was diverted around the city center. The city has a long and rich history in cheese making and trading; for years Gouda cheese for domestic and international use has been produced in this region. Woerden still holds its authentic (since 1885) cheese market at the market place in its center.

=== Roman castellum ===
Woerden is situated on the river Oude Rijn, near the confluence with the former stream. The lower stretch of the Linschoten stream from Montfoort and Linschoten to Woerden silted up a long time ago and its flow was diverted through the Lek and Hollandse IJssel rivers, but at one time it was an important branch of the Rhine delta, connecting the Lower Rhine from Wijk bij Duurstede to the Oude Rijn near Woerden. Near the former confluence was an area that was slightly more elevated than the surroundings, a natural levee, which — in an area that is prone to flooding — made it an attractive location for settlement.

Here, at the highest spot, the Romans built a castellum (&quot;Castellum Laurum&quot;), as part of the limes of the Roman Empire and thus part of the defense lines of the northern border of the Roman Empire. The first castellum was built in the 40s AD and was destroyed in 69 AD during the Batavian rebellion. In 70 AD, the castellum was rebuilt, and the Romans remained until 402 AD, with an interruption lasting from about 275-300 AD.

The Castellum was located at the present site of the medieval Petruschurch and surrounding churchyard. During construction work on a new underground parking facility in the city center of Woerden, the remains of numerous old Roman buildings and a Roman cargo ship were found. During field research, a lot became known about the Roman time in Woerden: the location of the castellum, the zone of defense waters with the entrance road and the remains of a Roman cargo ship.

=== The dark ages ===
Little is known about the period after the Romans left for good in 402 AD. It may be assumed that people continued to live here, but there is little archaeological evidence. A Frankish sword dated from the 8th century has been found on the site of the Roman Castellum in 2012. The area was contested between Frisians and Franks. Frankish King Dagobert I conquered the area around 630, and a small church was built in nearby Utrecht. Around 650, the Frisians came back, destroyed the Frankish church in Utrecht, and the Frisian king established his court there. Then, in 689 king Redbad was defeated by Frankish Duke Pippin of Herstal in the battle of Dorestad and the Franks regained control of the area. King Redbad reconquered Utrecht after Pippin died in 714, but the Frisian victory was short-lived: Duke Charles Martel defeated Redbad in 718. In 734, Charles Martel went on to vanquish the Frisians, in the Battle of the Boarn.

The missionaries followed in the footsteps of the Frankish conquerors: In 695 AD, Willibrord, known as the &quot;Apostle to the Frisians&quot; became Bishop of Utrecht, with interruptions due to Frisian incursions. Boniface worked here from 719 to 722. Liudger reports that Boniface preached in &quot;Wyrda&quot;, referring to &quot;Wierde&quot;, meaning that the place was on higher ground in the area. Around 850, the Bishop had to leave once more, this time because of Viking marauders. Bishop Balderik returned to Utrecht in 918, after the Viking threat subsided. The Bishop claims Woerden as part of his jurisdiction: In a list prepared between 918 and 948 it is mentioned that , meaning: In Woerden everything belongs to Saint Martin, i.e. the church in Utrecht.

=== Between bishop and count ===

The Bishop of Utrecht received land grants, first from the Frankish kings, and later from the Kings of Germany, in particular Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1024 AD, the bishops were made Princes of the Holy Roman Empire and the new Prince-bishopric of Utrecht was formed.

Around 1000 AD, settlement was limited to the river banks; further inland were undeveloped bogs. The bishops used their new authority to stimulate reclamation of this wilderness. Concessions were granted to settlers, who drained the bogs by digging dividing ditches beginning from rivers and streams and stretching about ¾ mile inland, thus creating the characteristic grid of fields still seen today. By about 1300 AD, the reclamation process had been completed.

In the meantime, a competing realm had developed to the west, along the coast. First known as West Frisia it became known as Holland when Floris II, Count of Holland moved his court to Leiden in 1101. The Counts of Holland expanded their influence, and by 1165 they built a fort called Svadeburg, near present-day Zwammerdam, about 7 miles to the west of Woerden. Around 1160, Bishop Godfrey van Rhenen built a castle in Woerden. Once more Woerden became a border town between two belligerent powers, a situation that lasted until 1527 when the Bishop of Utrecht sold his territories to Emperor Charles V and the two statelets were united under Charles&#x27; rule. Due to its strategic location on the border between the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht, various wars have been fought in and around Woerden by the various lords and ladies of these realms.

From about 1131 to 1296, the van Woerden family dominated local affairs in Woerden. Several scions of the family are known as &quot;Herman van Woerden&quot;. Originally they were stewards of the castle for the Bishop, but in time they sought to become independent. In 1274 Herman VI van Woerden formed an alliance with Gijsbrecht IV van Amstel, and revolted against bishop-elect John of Nassau. In 1278, Floris V, Count of Holland, intervened on the side of the much-weakened bishop, and defeated the rebellious lords. Gijsbrecht was taken prisoner, and Herman went into exile. In 1281, Floris V was awarded the lands of the rebellious lords, including Amsterdam and Woerden. In a 1288 peace agreement Floris restored the Lordship of Woerden to Herman van Woerden, but now as a vassal of the count. However, Herman did not prove himself to be a trustworthy vassal: in 1296 the humiliated lords Gijsbrecht IV van Amstel and Herman van Woerden entered the scene again as part of a conspiracy. Together with Gerard van Velzen they captured count Floris during a hunting party and the count was assassinated. In the aftermath, Gerard van Velzen was killed, and Herman van Woerden went again into exile. In 1300, John II, Count of Holland awarded the Lordship of Woerden to his brother Guy of Avesnes, who became Bishop of Utrecht the following year. In 1311, Guy returned the Lordship to his nephew, Count William III, and Woerden remained part of Holland thereafter.
Around 1370 bailiff ordered the construction of defensive walls and a moat to fortify the city, in order to shield Holland from renewed hostilities with Utrecht. Woerden received city rights from Albert I, Duke of Bavaria, and Count of Holland in 1372, even though Woerden was still a small town that harboured no more than about 720 citizens. Around the same time the Petruschurch was built; part of its steeple still stands. In 1410 John III, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing had the castle of Woerden constructed, and in 1510 the city hall was built. These buildings still exist, although the castle was extensively altered and renovated through the years.

On 1 November 1425, Woerden chose the side of Philip the Good in the conflict with Jacoba van Beieren, after Philip confirmed the town privileges and promised that the Lordship of Woerden would never be separated from the County of Holland by awarding it to someone else. During the reign of the Dukes of Burgundy, Philip the Good (1419–1467) and Charles the Bold (1467–1477) Woerden enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace, and by 1477 its population had almost tripled to about 1920. Charles the Bold&#x27;s death before the gates of Nancy was the prelude to renewed unrest, both with Utrecht and the duchy of Guelders, and the town suffered economic hardship because of it.

=== Heretics and rebels ===
Erasmus probably spent his boyhood from age five to nine in Woeden in the household of his father, the local priest from 1471.

The reign of Charles V was a period of relative peace and prosperity for Woerden, despite religious unrest. In April 1522, Charles V introduced the Inquisition in the Low Countries.

Johannes Pistorius Woerdensis (Jan de Bakker), a catholic priest, was the first preacher in the Northern Netherlands to be martyred as a direct result of his religious beliefs. His father was a sexton in Woerden and also tenant of the brickworks, and his surname was derived from that profession.

Jan de Bakker was a pupil of (Johannes Rhodius), headmaster of St. Jerome School of the Brethren of the Common Life in Utrecht. Rode was a proponent of Sacramentarianism, and in 1520 his father called Jan back to Woerden, perhaps out of concern about those heretic views. Jan transferred to Leuven, and in 1522 completed his education there. He returned to Woerden, was ordained in Utrecht as a priest, and assisted his father as sexton and deacon.

Jan started to spread the heretic views, and in May 1523 he and another priest were arrested by the steward of the castle. After a short while they were released, and it is thought that the two travelled to Wittenberg, but there is no evidence he met with Martin Luther. After he returned he continued his preachings, and the conflict with the Roman Catholic Church was further aggravated by the fact that he broke his celibacy, and got married. In the night of 9 May 1525, he was arrested and the next day transferred to The Hague, where he appeared before the Inquisition. He was defrocked and sentenced to death, and on 15 September 1525 burned at the stake in The Hague. His widow saved her live by recanting the heresies and lived out her life in an abbey.

The city magistrates of Woerden were tolerant towards the Lutheran confession. In 1566 this resulted in a confrontation with duke Eric of Brunswick, who was Lord of Woerden at that time.

Although Eric of Brunswick was raised Lutheran he converted to Catholicism in 1547, much to the regret of his mother Elisabeth of Brandenburg. Eric served as commanding officer in the armies of Charles V and Philip II, and fought on their side in the Schmalkaldic War (1546–1547) and the Franco-Habsburg War (1551–1559). During the Battle of St. Quentin (1557) he distinguished himself by taking French Marshals Anne de Montmorency and Jacques d&#x27;Albon de Saint-André prisoner. These prisoners were very important to Philip II as a bargaining chip during negotiations for the peace Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis. In 1558, Philip II granted Duke Eric of Brunswick the Lordship of Woerden as compensation, over the objection of the city magistrates of Woerden who felt that this was an infringement of promises made by Philip the Good in 1425.

In the wake of iconoclastic riots that swept the country in 1566 a prominent citizen of Woerden, Warnaer Claesz, petitioned the city magistrates to introduce the Augsburg Confession. There was also a disruption of the church worship. As a precaution, the city magistrates removed icons and other valuables from the church and stored them in a safe place, and closed the church. The court of Holland concurred with the actions taken by the city magistrates, but Duke Eric of Brunswick objected. He demanded that Catholic worship would be restored. The city magistrates delayed by questioning his authority in this matter. Duke Eric responded by raising a small army and forced the city magistrates to comply.

Duke Eric was also instrumental in suppressing the ill-fated rebellion of Hendrik van Brederode, Lord of Vianen. After the rebel army was defeated in the Battle of Oosterweel (13 March 1567) Eric of Brunswick captured Vianen on May 5, 1567.

In later history, the town saw occupation by the Spanish (1575, 1576) and the French (1672, 1673, and particularly disastrous in 1813).

=== Modern era ===
In 1989, there was a local redrawing of province boundaries as a result of which Woerden found itself transferred from South Holland to the province of Utrecht. In 2015, the city&#x27;s refugee centre formed the scene of a violent attack by 20 hooded people, bearing fireworks and pushing down fences.

<text>Zeist () is the capital and largest town of the municipality of Zeist. The town is located in the Utrecht province of the Netherlands, east of the city of Utrecht.

== History ==
The town of &quot;Seist&quot; was first mentioned in a charter in the year 838. The original settlement was located at the present &quot;Dorpsstraat&quot;. In the late 12th century, a church was built here. Its tower is now a part of the Reformed Church, the remainder of which was built in the 19th century. Until medieval times, a branch of the river Rhine flowed close to the centre of the town. Three mansions were built near the village: the &quot;Huis te Zeist&quot;, Kersbergen, and Blikkenburg.
From 1677 to 1686, the &quot;Slot Zeist&quot; was built on or near the ruins of &quot;Kasteel Zeist&quot;, the original castle (donjon) of Rodgar van Zeist. There is very little documentation on the family that lived there, but a few names are found: in the 12th century a &quot;Godefridus de Seist&quot; and in the late 13th century another Godefridus, a knight, with his son Johannes and his daughter Petronilla. (&quot;Bronnen voor de geschiedenis van Zeist&quot;, deel 1, ed. Van Hinsbergen) The last member of the van Zeist family was a woman, Elisabeth van Zeist, who married a member of the Borre van Amerongen family. They had a son who adopted his mother&#x27;s name and his father&#x27;s coat-of-arms.

In the last quarter of the 17th century, Count Willem Adriaan van Nassau, an illegitimate descendant of Prince Maurice of Orange, acquired the property and built Slot Zeist in the Dutch Classicist style. Murals by Daniel Marot are still largely intact. Members of the &quot;Evangelische Broedergemeente&quot; (Evangelical Brethren&#x27;s Congregation), the Dutch name for the Moravians, settled in Zeist in 1746, building for their community an impressive array of 18th century Classicist houses planned around two squares. Their headquarters are still located in the centre of town, next to &quot;the palace&quot;. The oldest Dutch archives of the Moravians are kept at the Utrecht Archival Centre at Utrecht.

In the 19th century, Zeist became a favorite residence for the rich, mainly from the city of Utrecht.

Camp New Amsterdam, (vliegbasis Soesterberg) a former Royal Netherlands Air Force military airbase near this town, was the venue for the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial to take place outside the UK, but under Scots law. The court was designated the Scottish Court in the Netherlands.

== Organisations and surroundings ==

Zeist is the location of the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), the Royal Dutch Korfball Association (KNKV) and the International Korfball Federation(IKF). It is also known for the forests surrounding the town. For many years the Dutch National Archaeological Research Service (&quot;Rijksdienst voor het Oudheidkundig Bodemonderzoek&quot;) was housed at Slot Zeist. Triodos Bank headquarters is also based there.

<doc id="118691" wikidata="Q1140298" url="?curid=118691" title="Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act">
<text>The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), Pub. L. 101-601, 25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq., 104 Stat. 3048, is a United States federal law enacted on November 16, 1990.

The Act requires federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funding to return Native American &quot;cultural items&quot; to lineal descendants and culturally affiliated American Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and Native Hawaiian organizations. Cultural items include human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. A program of federal grants assists in the repatriation process and the Secretary of the Interior may assess civil penalties on museums that fail to comply.

NAGPRA also establishes procedures for the inadvertent discovery or planned excavation of Native American cultural items on federal or tribal lands. While these provisions do not apply to discoveries or excavations on private or state lands, the collection provisions of the Act may apply to Native American cultural items if they come under the control of an institution that receives federal funding.

NAGPRA makes it a criminal offense to traffic in Native American human remains without right of possession or in Native American cultural items obtained in violation of the Act. Penalties for a first offense could originally reach 12 months imprisonment and a $100,000 fine. The statute was amended in 2022 to increase the penalty for a first conviction for trafficking Native American human remains from 12 months imprisonment to one year and one day (a felony) and for a subsequent conviction from five years to ten years. An initial conviction for trafficking of Native American cultural items remains a misdemeanor (imprisonment of up to one year), but the penalty for a subsequent conviction was likewise changed from five to ten years.

The Department of the Interior revised the regulations implementing NAGPRA in 2024 to clarify steps for its implementation. The revised regulations, which went into effect on January 12, 2024, state &quot;...museums and Federal agencies must defer to the Native American traditional knowledge of lineal descendants, Indian Tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations.&quot;

==Background==
The intent of the NAGPRA legislation is to address long-standing claims by federally recognized tribes for the return of human remains and cultural objects unlawfully obtained from pre-contact, post-contact, former, and current Native American homelands. Interpretation of human and Indigenous rights, prehistoric presence, cultural affiliation with antiquities, and the return of remains and objects can be controversial and contested. It includes provisions that delineate the legal processes by which museums and federal agencies are required to return certain Native American cultural items—human remains, gravesite materials, and other objects of cultural patrimony—to proven lineal descendants, culturally-related Native American tribes, and Native Hawaiian groups.

Outcomes of NAGPRA repatriation efforts are slow and cumbersome, leading many tribes to spend considerable effort documenting their requests; collections&#x27; holders are obliged to inform and engage with tribes whose materials they may possess. NAGPRA was enacted primarily at the insistence and by the direction of members of Native American nations.

===Tribal concerns===
Tribes had many reasons based in law that made legislation concerning tribal grave protection and repatriation necessary.
*State Statutory Law: Historically, states only regulated and protected marked graves. Native American graves were often unmarked and did not receive the protection provided by these statutes.
*Common Law: The colonizing population formed much of the legal system that developed over the course of settling the United States. This law did not often take into account the unique Native American practices concerning graves and other burial practices. It did not account for government actions against Native Americans, such as removal, the relationship that Native Americans as different peoples maintain with their dead, and sacred ideas and myths related to the possession of graves.
*Equal Protection: Native Americans, as well as others, often found that the remains of Native American graves were treated differently from the dead of other races.
*First Amendment: As in most racial and social groups, Native American burial practices relate strongly to their religious beliefs and practices. They held that when tribal dead were desecrated, disturbed, or withheld from burial, their religious beliefs and practices are being infringed upon. Religious beliefs and practices are protected by the First Amendment.
*Sovereignty Rights: Native Americans hold unique rights as sovereign bodies, leading to their relations to be controlled by their own laws and customs. The relationship between the people and their dead is an internal relationship, to be understood as under the sovereign jurisdiction of the tribe.
*Treaty: From the beginning of the U.S. government and tribe relations, the tribe maintained rights unless specifically divested to the U.S. government in a treaty. The U.S. government does not have the right to disturb Native American graves or their dead, because it has not been granted by any treaty.

==Description==
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act is a law that establishes the ownership of cultural items excavated or discovered on federal or tribal land after November 16, 1990. The act also applies to land transferred by the federal government to the states under the Water Resources Department Act. However, the provisions of the legislation do not apply to private lands. The Act states that Native American remains and associated funerary objects belong to lineal descendants. If lineal descendants cannot be identified, then those remains and objects, along with associated funerary and sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony belong to the tribe on whose lands the remains were found or the tribe having the closest known relationship to them. Tribes find the burden of proof is on them, if it becomes necessary to demonstrate a cultural relationship that may not be well-documented or understood. Nowhere has this issue been more pronounced than in California, where many small bands were extinguished before they could be recognized, and only a handful have obtained federal recognition as Native Americans and descendants of Native American bands.

Congress attempted to &quot;strike a balance between the interest in scientific examination of skeletal remains and the recognition that Native Americans, like people from every culture around the world, have a religious and spiritual reverence for the remains of their ancestors.&quot;

The act also requires each federal agency, museum, or institution that receives federal funds to prepare an inventory of remains and funerary objects and a summary of sacred objects, cultural patrimony objects, and unassociated funerary objects. The act provides for repatriation of these items when requested by the appropriate descendant of the tribe. This applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before November 16, 1990.

Since the legislation passed, the human remains of approximately 32,000 individuals have been returned to their respective tribes. Nearly 670,000 funerary objects, 120,000 unassociated funerary objects, and 3,500 sacred objects have been returned.
The statute attempts to mediate a significant tension that exists between the tribes&#x27; communal interests in the respectful treatment of their deceased ancestors and related cultural items and the scientists&#x27; individual interests in the study of those same human remains and items. The act divides the treatment of American Indian human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony into two basic categories. Under the inadvertent discovery and planned excavation component of the act and regulations, if federal officials anticipate that activities on federal and tribal lands after November 16, 1990 might have an effect on American Indian burials—or if burials are discovered during such activities—they must consult with potential lineal descendants or American Indian tribal officials as part of their compliance responsibilities. For planned excavations, consultation must occur during the planning phase of the project. For inadvertent discoveries, the regulations delineate a set of short deadlines for initiating and completing consultation. The repatriation provision, unlike the ownership provision, applies to remains or objects discovered at any time, even before the effective date of the act, whether or not discovered on tribal or federal land. The act allows archaeological teams a short time for analysis before the remains must be returned. Once it is determined that human remains are American Indian, analysis can occur only through documented consultation (on federal lands) or consent (on tribal lands).

A criminal provision of the Act prohibits trafficking in Native American human remains, or in Native American &quot;cultural items.&quot; Under the inventory and notification provision of the act, federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funds are required to summarize their collections that may contain items subject to NAGPRA. Additionally, federal agencies and institutions must prepare inventories of human remains and funerary objects. Under the act, funerary objects are considered &quot;associated&quot; if they were buried as part of a burial ceremony with a set of human remains still in possession of the federal agency or other institution. &quot;Unassociated&quot; funerary objects are artifacts where human remains were not initially collected by—or were subsequently destroyed, lost, or no longer in possession of—the agency or institution. Consequently, this legislation also applies to many Native American artifacts, especially burial items and religious artifacts. It has necessitated mass cataloguing of the Native American collections in order to identify the living heirs, culturally affiliated Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations of remains and artifacts. NAGPRA has had a dramatic effect on the day-to-day practice of archaeology and physical anthropology in the United States. In many cases, NAGPRA helped stimulate interactions of archaeologists and museum professionals with Native Americans that were felt to be constructive by all parties.

==History==

===Cultural exploitation===
The late 19th century was one of the most difficult periods in Native American history regarding the loss of cultural artifacts and land. With the founding of museums and scholarly studies of Native American peoples increasing with the growth of anthropology and archeology as disciplines, private collectors and museums competed to acquire artifacts, which many Native Americans considered ancestral assets, but others sold. This competition existed not only between museums such as the Smithsonian Institution (founded in 1846) and museums associated with universities, but also between museums in the United States and museums in Europe. In the 1880s and 1890s, collecting was done by untrained adventurers. As of the year 1990, federal agencies reported having the remains of 14,500 deceased Natives in their possession, which had accumulated since the late 19th century. Many institutions said they used the remains of Native Americans for anthropological research, to gain more information about humans. At one time, in since discredited comparative racial studies, institutions such as the Army Medical Museum sought to demonstrate racial characteristics to prove the inferiority of Native Americans.

=== Residential and commercial developments ===
Residential and commercial development was a driving force in the desecration of many Native American burial sites, particularly in the 20th century with the expansion of suburbs and urban sprawl. For example, in &quot;Wana the Bear v. Community Construction&quot; (1982), two-hundred Miwok ancestral remains were bulldozed in the development of a residential area in Stockton, California. A descendant of the people, Wana the Bear, attempted to prevent further desecration by arguing that the site should continue to be protected as a cemetery. The California Courts of Appeal sided with the construction company, which finished in its destruction of the burial grounds for residential development.

===Maria Pearson===
Maria Pearson is often credited with being the earliest catalyst for the passage of NAGPRA legislation; she has been called &quot;the Founding Mother of modern Indian repatriation movement&quot; and the &quot;Rosa Parks of NAGPRA&quot;. In the early 1970s, Pearson was appalled that the skeletal remains of Native Americans were treated differently from white remains. Her husband, an engineer with the Iowa Department of Transportation, told her that both Native American and white remains were uncovered during road construction in Glenwood, Iowa. While the remains of 26 white burials were quickly reburied, the remains of a Native American mother and child were sent to a lab for study instead. Pearson protested to Governor Robert D. Ray, finally gaining an audience with him after sitting outside his office in traditional attire. &quot;You can give me back my people&#x27;s bones and you can quit digging them up&quot;, she responded when the governor asked what he could do for her. The ensuing controversy led to the passage of the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, the first legislative act in the United States that specifically protected Native American remains.

Emboldened by her success, Pearson went on to lobby national leaders, and her efforts, combined with the work of many other activists, led to the creation of NAGPRA. Pearson and other activists were featured in the 1995 BBC documentary &quot;Bones of Contention&quot;.

===Slack Farm and Dickson Mounds===
The 1987 looting of a 500-year-old burial mound at the Slack Farm in Kentucky, in which human remains were tossed to the side while relics were stolen, made national news and helped to galvanize popular support for protection of Native American graves. Likewise, several protests at the Dickson Mounds site in Illinois, where numerous Indian skeletons were exposed on display, also increased national awareness of the issue.

==Challenges==
A number of archeologists are concerned that they are being prevented from studying ancient remains which cannot be traced to any historic tribe. Many of the tribes migrated to their territories at the time of European encounter within 100–500 years from other locations, so their ancestors were not located in the historic territories. The issue has repeatedly stalled archaeological investigations, such as in the case of the Spirit Cave mummy; fears have been voiced that an anti-scientific sentiment could well have permeated politics to an extent that scientists might find their work to be continuously barred by Native Americans rights activists.

===Kennewick Man===
Compliance with the legislation can be complicated such as the Kennewick Man, a skeleton found on July 28, 1996 near Kennewick, Washington. The almost complete skeleton was close to 9,000 years old. Ancient remains from North America are rare, making it a valuable scientific discovery. The federally recognized Umatilla, Colville, Yakima, and Nez Perce tribes had each claimed Kennewick Man as their ancestor, and sought permission to rebury him. Kennewick, Washington is classified as part of the ancestral land of the Umatilla.

Archaeologists said that because of Kennewick Man&#x27;s great age, there was insufficient evidence to connect him to modern tribes. The great age of the remains makes this discovery scientifically valuable. As archaeologists, forensic specialists, and linguists differed about whether the adult male was of Indigenous origin, the standing law, if conclusively found by a preponderance of evidence to be Native American, would give the tribe of the geographic area where he was found a claim to the remains. Anthropologists wanted to preserve and study the remains, however, steps had already been taken to repatriate the Kennewick Man given that he was discovered on federal lands. A lawsuit was filed by Douglas Owsley and Robson Bonnichsen, along with other notable anthropologists, in the hopes of preventing the repatriation of the skeleton. In 2004, the court sided with the plaintiffs&#x27; assertion that due to the skeleton&#x27;s age, there was not enough information available at the time to conclude whether the Kennewick Man had any cultural or genetic ties to any present day Native American tribes, and granted the plaintiffs&#x27; request to further study the remains. New evidence could still emerge in defense of tribal claims to ancestry, but emergent evidence may require more sophisticated and precise methods of determining genetic descent, given that there was no cultural evidence accompanying the remains.

One tribe claiming ancestry to Kennewick Man offered up a DNA test, and in 2015 it was found that the Kennewick man is &quot;more closely related to modern Native Americans than any other living population.&quot; In September 2016, the U.S. House and Senate passed legislation to return the ancient bones to a coalition of Columbia Basin tribes for reburial according to their traditions. The coalition includes the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, and the Wanapum Band of Priest Rapids. The remains were buried on February 18, 2017, with 200 members of five Columbia Basin tribes, at an undisclosed location in the area.

== &quot;Return to the Earth&quot; project ==
&quot;Return to the Earth&quot; is an inter-religious project whose goal is to inter unidentified remains in regional burial sites. Over 110,000 remains that cannot be associated with a particular tribe are held in institutions across the United States, as of 2006. The project seeks to enable a process of reconciliation between Native and non-Native peoples, construct cedar burial boxes, produce burial cloths and fund the repatriation of remains. The first of the burial sites is near the Cheyenne Cultural Center in Clinton, Oklahoma.

== Institutions with remains ==
Institutions with non-repatriated remains:

* The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, which has more than 5000 human remains; some of these may belong to the Seminole Tribe of Florida.
* American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, New York is estimated to hold more than 1900 remains.
* The Field Museum in Chicago is estimated to hold more than 1000 remains.
* The Ohio History Connection (previously the Ohio Historical Society) is estimated to hold more than 7100 remains.
* Harvard University&#x27;s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology is estimated to hold more than 6100 remains.
* Illinois State Museum is estimated to hold more than 7500 remains.
* Indiana University is estimated to hold more than 4800 remains.
* The Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley is estimated to hold more than 9000 remains.
* The University of Kansas holds at least 271 individuals’ remains and 539 funerary objects with almost half the remains being from Wyandotte County.
* The University of North Dakota discovered dozens of remains in collections on campus in March 2022.
* California State University System holds 5804 human remains and an additional 692,500 potential cultural items such as artifacts, animal bone, and samples on 21 of its 23 campuses.
* The South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology has 252 ancestral remains and 9748 known funerary objects.
* The Charleston Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, has 80 remains after repatriating two.

== Related state laws ==
Cal NAGPRA (Assembly Bill (978) is an act created by the state of California which was signed into law in 2001. The act was created to implement the same repatriation expectations for state-funded institutions, museums, repositories, or collections as those federally supported through NAGPRA. Cal NAGPRA also supports non-federally recognized tribes within California that were exempt from legal rights to repatriation under the federal NAGPRA act.

== International policies ==
The issues of such resources are being addressed by international groups dealing with Indigenous rights. For example, in 1995 the United States signed an agreement with El Salvador in order to protect all pre‑Columbian artifacts from leaving the region. Soon after, it signed similar agreements with Canada, Peru, Guatemala, and Mali and demonstrated leadership in implementing the 1970 UNESCO Convention. The UNESCO convention membership increased to 86 countries by 1997, and 193 by 2007. UNESCO appears to be reducing the illicit antiquities trade. Although difficult to track, the scholar Phyllis Messenger notes that some antiquities traders have written articles denouncing the agreements, which suggests that it is reducing items sold to them.

An international predecessor of the UNESCO Convention and NAGPRA is the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The Hague Convention was the first international convention to focus on preserving cultural heritage from the devastation of war. Looting and destruction of other civilizations have been characteristics of war recorded from the first accounts of all cultures.
On September 30, 1897, Lieutenant Robert Peary brought six Inuit from Greenland to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, at the request of the anthropologist Franz Boas, in order to &quot;obtain leisurely certain information which will be of the greatest scientific importance&quot; regarding Inuit culture. About two weeks after arrival at the museum, all six of the Inuit became sick with colds and fever. They began to perform their tribal healing process and were mocked for their bizarre behavior. Viewing these people became a form of entertainment for the Americans. By November 1, 1897, they were admitted to the Bellevue Hospital Center with tuberculosis, which they likely had contracted before their trip. In February, the first Inuit died, followed shortly after by two more. By the time the sickness had run its course, only two men survived. Minik was adopted by a superintendent of the museum, while Uissakassak returned to his homeland in Greenland. Later, after being lied to and being told that his father Qisuk had received a proper Inuit burial, Minik was shocked to find his father&#x27;s skeleton on display in the museum.

In 1993 the museum agreed to return the four Inuit skeletons to Greenland for proper burial. Representatives of the Museum went to Greenland that year to participate. In contrast to peoples in other areas, some local Inuit thought that the burial was more desired by the Christian representatives of the museum, and that the remains could have just as appropriately been kept in New York. David Hurst Thomas&#x27; study of the case shows the complexity of reburial and repatriation cases, and the need for individual approaches to each case by all affected parties.

===Protecting cultural property===
In the United States, the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) protects archaeological sites on federally owned lands. Privately owned sites are controlled by the owners. In some areas, archaeological foundations or similar organizations buy archaeological sites in order to conserve cultural resources associated with such properties.

Other countries may use three basic types of laws to protect cultural remains:

*Selective export control laws control the trade of the most important artifacts while still allowing some free trade. Countries that use these laws include Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
*Total export restriction laws are used by some countries to enact an embargo and completely shut off export of cultural property. Many Latin American and Mediterranean countries use these laws.
*Other countries, such as Mexico, use national ownership laws to declare national ownership for all cultural artifacts. These laws cover control of artifacts that have not been discovered, to try to prevent looting of potential sites before exploration.

<text>The Connie Sue Highway is an outback unsealed track that runs between the Aboriginal community of Warburton on the Great Central Road and Rawlinna on the Trans-Australian Railway. It lies entirely in the state of Western Australia, crosses the Great Victoria Desert and Nullarbor Plain, and is approximately long.

==History==
The Warburton-Rawlinna road was pioneered as part of a network of roads for the Weapons Research Establishment at Woomera, South Australia. Surveying began in July 1962, when Len Beadell, with wife Anne and baby Connie Sue, left Adelaide and travelled via the Stuart Highway and the Gunbarrel Highway to Warburton. From there they roughly south in his Land Rover, until reaching the approximate latitude of the Anne Beadell Highway, which was under construction from the east. Turning east, they drove another through the Great Victoria desert to a point west of Serpentine Lakes to join up with his Gunbarrel Road Construction Party (GRCP). They ran out of fuel and water about short of their destination, but with the aid of radio and flares, were joined by their team.

Beadell and family then began a reconnaissance west towards Neale Junction, followed by the GRCP. After two weeks of intense activity during August, the Anne Beadell Highway reached Neale Junction. From there, Beadell and party then commenced building a new road north towards Warburton. Just north of Neale Junction, Beadell&#x27;s infant daughter Connie Sue was observed standing up for the first time in her tea-chest bassinet. It was decided there and then that the Warburton-Rawlinna road would be known as the Connie Sue Highway.
The 320 kilometre section of new road reached Warburton on 15 September. After obtaining supplies, the construction team turned south and by early October were back at Neale Junction. Beadell then began surveying south towards Rawlinna to make the southern half of the new Connie Sue Highway. The GRCP with bulldozer and grader followed Beadell&#x27;s tracks, constructing the road as they went. By the end of October the road was completed, and the Beadell family returned to Adelaide via the Eyre Highway.

==Additional details==
Approximately halfway along the route is Neale Junction, west of Ilkurlka, where the highway intersects with another outback road, the Anne Beadell Highway.

The road, like many Len Beadell built, is a &quot;highway&quot; in name only. It is remote and does not carry regular traffic. There is no available ground water and it is one of the longest stretches in Australia between fuel pumps. The only place on the highway that sells fuel is Warburton. There is no fuel for sale at Rawlinna. The closest available is more than to the south, at Caiguna or Cocklebiddy, on the Eyre Highway.

The track is not considered suitable for unprepared travellers. A free permit is required to travel on track in the Ngaanyatjarrak determination area and to enter Warburton. Obtaining a permit for the track requires a minimum of five working days turnaround.

<doc id="118695" wikidata="Q4330233" url="?curid=118695" title="CONELRAD">
<text>CONELRAD (&quot;Control of Electromagnetic Radiation&quot;) was a method of emergency broadcasting to the public of the United States in the event of enemy attack during the Cold War. It was intended to allow continuous broadcast of civil defense information to the public using radio stations, while rapidly switching the transmitter stations to make the broadcasts unsuitable for Soviet bombers that might attempt to home in on the signals (as was done during World War II, when German radio stations, based in or near cities, were used as beacons by bomber pilots).

U.S. President Harry S. Truman established CONELRAD in 1951. After the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles reduced the likelihood of a bomber attack, and the development of superior navigation systems that did not rely on radio direction finding for use in those bomber aircraft which were sent against the United States, CONELRAD was replaced by the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) on August 5, 1963, which was later replaced by the Emergency Alert System (EAS) on January 1, 1997; all have been administered by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Unlike the EBS and EAS, CONELRAD was never intended for use in local civil emergencies such as severe weather. However, the system&#x27;s alerting protocol could be used for alerting of a natural disaster by 1957.

==History==

Before 1951, there was no systematic way for the U.S. government to communicate with citizens during an emergency. However, broadcasters would typically interrupt normal programming to issue emergency bulletins, as happened during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and the first successful tornado warning in 1948. Such bulletins were the forerunner to CONELRAD.

The CONELRAD concept was originally known as the &quot;Key Station System&quot;. According to an FCC document created during the &quot;Informal Government–Industry Technical Conference&quot; on March 26, 1951:

CONELRAD had a simple system for alerting the public and other &quot;downstream&quot; stations, consisting of a sequence of shutting the station off for five seconds, returning to the air for five seconds, again shutting down for five seconds, returning to the air again (for 5 seconds), and then transmitting a 1 kHz tone for 15 seconds. Key stations would be alerted directly. All other broadcast stations would monitor a designated station in their area.

In the event of an emergency, all United States television and FM radio stations were required to stop broadcasting. Upon alert, most AM medium-wave stations shut down. The stations that stayed on the air would transmit on either 640 or 1240 kHz. They would transmit for several minutes and then go off the air, and another station would take over on the same frequency in a &quot;round robin&quot; chain. This was to confuse enemy aircraft who might be navigating using radio direction finding. By law, radio sets manufactured between 1953 and 1963 had these two frequencies marked by the triangle-in-circle (&quot;CD Mark&quot;) symbol of Civil Defense.

Although the system by which the CONELRAD process was initiated (switching the transmitter on and off) was simple, it was prone to numerous false alarms, especially during lightning storms. Transmitters could be damaged by the quick cycling. The switching later became known informally as the &quot;EBS Stress Test&quot; (due to many transmitters failing during tests) and was eventually discontinued when broadcast technology advanced enough to make it unnecessary.

Beginning January 2, 1957, U.S. amateur radio came under CONELRAD rules and amateur stations were also required to stop transmitting if commercial radio stations went off the air due to an alert. Several companies marketed special receivers that monitored local broadcast stations, sounding an alarm and automatically deactivating the amateur&#x27;s transmitter when the broadcast station went off the air.

In a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article featured in the November 14, 1960, issue, the author details why the warning system consisting of localized civil defense sirens and the CONELRAD radio-alert system was &quot;basically unsound&quot;. The author&#x27;s alternative was to advocate for the National Emergency Alarm Repeater as a supplement, which did not need a radio or television to be switched on to warn citizens, nor a large CD siren to be in their vicinity.

=== False alarms ===
On May 5, 1955, the Continental Air Defense Command Western Division went to yellow alert for 3 to 10 minutes (depending on the alerted state), beginning at 10:40 AM PDT. The alert was raised by a Canadian radar emplacement which was unaware of an outbound United States B-47 bomber training exercise, due to communication failures. A yellow alert meant &quot;attack expectable&quot;, and the word was sent to government and civil defense organizations. In the seven-minute window, the city of Oakland, the Sacramento Capitol Building, and others quickly sounded their alert sirens. In contrast, the City of Sacramento civil defense director waited for further confirmation before sounding the citywide siren; ultimately, he never did so. The alert was not acted on at all in Colorado due to the short length, and in Nevada, there was no alert because the person responsible for acting on it &quot;did not know what to do with it&quot;. In Utah, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Texas, and Louisiana, a yellow alert was not passed along to civil authorities at all, and those states issued a &quot;white&quot; (military emergency) alert to units in their state instead. Even with the short alert window, many radio and television stations went off the air in accordance with CONELRAD procedure, but the alert was not long enough for stations to start broadcasting on the two authorized CONELRAD frequencies.

On the evening of November 5, 1959, WJPG, the CONELRAD control station for northeast Wisconsin and Upper Michigan was incorrectly sent an alert status message, &quot;This is an air defense radio alert&quot;, rather than what should have been sent for a test, &quot;This is an air defense line check.&quot; All three of Green Bay, Wisconsin&#x27;s television stations (WFRV-TV, WLUK-TV, and WBAY-TV), as well as Green Bay radio stations WBAY and WJPG (and other Upper Michigan radio stations) were immediately taken off line as preparations were made for high priority stations to begin broadcasting on the two authorized CONELRAD AM frequencies (which in that area would force WOMT, a station in nearby Manitowoc at 1240 AM, off the air). The transmission error was realized and CONELRAD alert preparation (and its media blackout) reversed for affected stations about 20 minutes later.

A very similar false attack alarm was sent to radio and television stations through CONELRAD&#x27;s replacement, the Emergency Broadcast System, at 9:33 AM EST on Saturday, February 20, 1971. This message was sent by accident instead of the usual weekly EAN test.

<doc id="118697" wikidata="Q244944" url="?curid=118697" title="Herostratus">
<text>Herostratus () was a 4th-century BC Greek, accused of seeking notoriety as an arsonist by destroying the second Temple of Artemis in Ephesus (on the outskirts of present-day Selçuk), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The act prompted his execution and the creation of a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; law forbidding anyone to mention his name, orally or in writing. The law was ultimately ineffective, as evidenced by surviving accounts of his crime. Thus, Herostratus has become an eponym for someone who commits a criminal act in order to become famous.

== History ==
Archeological evidence indicates the site of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus had been of sacred use since the Bronze Age, and the original building was destroyed during a flood in the 7th century BC. A second temple was commissioned by King Croesus of Lydia around 560 BC and built by Cretan architects including Chersiphron, constructed largely of marble, and measuring long and wide with its pillars standing tall. The sculpted bases of the pillars contained life-sized carvings and the roof opened to the sky around a statue of Artemis. The second temple was included on an early list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World by Herodotus in the 5th century BC, and was well known in ancient times.

Little is known about the life of Herostratus, though it is thought he may have been someone of low social standing, a non-Ephesian or a slave. According to tradition, the fire that destroyed the second temple was set on the day Alexander the Great was born, 21 July 356 BC. Herostratus was then captured and tortured on the rack, where he confessed to having committed the arson in an attempt to immortalize his name. To dissuade those of similar intentions, the Ephesian authorities not only executed Herostratus, but attempted to condemn him to a legacy of obscurity by forbidding mention of his name under penalty of death. However, the ancient historian Theopompus, who was not Ephesian but rather Chian, mentions the name of Herostratus in his &quot;Philippica&quot;, and it appears again later in the works of Strabo. It is said that in fact his name has outlived the names of his judges, and in his 1658 work &quot;Hydriotaphia&quot; Sir Thomas Browne states: But the iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth her poppy, and deals with the memory of men without distinction to merit of perpetuity. [...] &quot;Herostratus&quot; lives that burnt the Temple of &quot;Diana&quot;, he is almost lost that built it [...] Who knows whether the best of men be known? or whether there be not more remarkable persons forgot, then any that stand remembred [sic] in the known account of time?

Work on a third temple at the site began in 323 BC, resulting in a larger and more ornate temple that would be included by Antipater of Sidon as one of Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

==Legacy==
Herostratus&#x27; name lived on in classical literature and has passed into modern languages as a term for someone who commits a criminal act in order to achieve notoriety. According to Julia H. Fawcett, Herostratus &quot;exemplifies a figure asserting his right to self-definition, one who strikes out against a history to which he is unknown by performing himself back into that history—through whatever means necessary.&quot; The term &quot;Herostratic fame&quot; refers to Herostratus and means &quot;fame [sought] at any cost&quot;.

===In literature and the arts===
* Chaucer makes reference to Herostratus in &quot;The House of Fame&quot;: &quot;&quot;I am that ylke shrewe, ywis, / That brende the temple of Ysidis / In Athenes, loo, that citee.&quot; / &quot;And wherfor didest thou so?&quot; quod she. / &quot;By my thrift,&quot; quod he, &quot;madame, / I wolde fayn han had a fame, / As other folk hadde in the toun...&quot;&quot;
* Many authors from 16th- and 17th-century Spain refer to Herostratus to represent someone who will do anything to gain notoriety. He is discussed in Chapter 8 of the second part of Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1615), along with Julius Caesar and Hernán Cortés. Don García, the protagonist of Ruiz de Alarcón&#x27;s &quot;La verdad sospechosa&quot; (&quot;Suspect Truth&quot;), compares his feats to the ancient character.
* Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; (1699) contains the oft-quoted line, &quot;The aspiring youth that fired the Ephesian dome / Outlives in fame the pious fool that rais&#x27;d it.&quot;
* In the chapter titled &quot;Dreams&quot; in Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Mardi, and a Voyage Thither&quot; (1849), the protagonist states, &quot;[W]hoso stones me, shall be as Erostratus, who put torch to the temple...&quot;
*Jaroslav Hašek, in the preface of his last novel &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; (1921–1923), compared Herostratus to the protagonist Švejk in praise of the latter.
* In his 6 October 1939 speech to the Berlin Reichstag, Adolf Hitler made a reference to Herostratus, making a contemporary comparison: &quot;It is clear to me that there is a certain Jewish international capitalism and journalism that has no feeling at all in common with the people whose interests they pretend to represent, but who, like Herostratus of old, regard incendiarism as the greatest success of their lives.&quot;
* The protagonist of the 1967 film &quot;Herostratus&quot; hires a marketing company to turn his suicide-by-jumping into a mass-media spectacle.
* In Gore Vidal&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Two Sisters&quot;, the real-life story of Herostratus serves as a sub-plot.
* In Grigori Gorin&#x27;s 1972 play &quot;Forget Herostratus!&quot;, a &quot;theater man&quot; from the present observes the judgement of Herostratus in order to understand the source of the disaster that plagues humanity.
* Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s short story &quot;Erostratus&quot; (1939) is directly based on the story of Herostratus.
*Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Stalker&quot; makes reference to Herostratus. As the protagonist wishes to destroy something associated with wonder, he blows up a mysterious restricted site known as &quot;the zone&quot;.
* The tale of Herostratus is directly referenced in two songs from the If These Trees Could Talk album &quot;Above the Earth, Below the Sky&quot; (2009).
*In Sam Levinson&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;Assassination Nation&quot;, a hacker under the handle &quot;Er0str4tus&quot; leaks half of the town of Salem&#x27;s personal information &quot;for the lulz&quot;, sending the town into a frenzy of violence.

== History ==
Asten has a rich history going back to the Roman period. In the swamp of the village&#x27;s national park &#x27;De Peel&#x27; an ancient Roman centurion helmet was found. Silhouets of Hunter-Gatherer and Agricultural societies were also found in the area.
The village has a castle dating back to the 12th century, at the south of the current village. It has also given its name to the village: &quot;Aa-Stein&quot;, or &quot;stone building on the river Aa&quot;. A second stone-built fortified building was suspected at the north, at the site of the current Slotweg (&quot;castle road&quot;) to be precise. Some stone fragments have been excavated, although no conclusive evidence of a fortified building has been produced here. The village was pillaged and burnt twice in the 17th century, by Austrian and Swedish army troops.

<text>Baarle-Nassau () is a municipality and town in the southern Netherlands, located in the province of North Brabant. It had a population of in . The town is the site of a complicated borderline between Belgium and the Netherlands: it encloses 22 small exclaves of the Belgian town Baarle-Hertog, of which the two largest contain seven counter-enclaves of Baarle-Nassau, and the main body of Belgium contains another.

==Geography==

===The border with Baarle-Hertog, Belgium===
Baarle-Nassau is closely linked, with complicated borders, to the Belgian exclaves of Baarle-Hertog. Baarle-Hertog consists of 26 separate parcels of land. Apart from the main parcel, known as Zondereigen and located north of the Belgian town of Merksplas, there are 22 Belgian exclaves in the Netherlands and three other parcels on the Dutch-Belgian border. There are also six Dutch exclaves located within the largest Belgian exclave, one within the second-largest, and an eighth within Zondereigen. The smallest Belgian parcel, H7, locally named , measures .

The border&#x27;s complexity results from numerous medieval treaties, agreements, land-swaps and sales between the Lords of Breda and the Dukes of Brabant. Generally speaking, predominantly agricultural or built environments became constituents of Brabant, while other parts devolved to Breda. These distributions were ratified and clarified as a part of the borderline settlements arrived at during the Treaty of Maastricht in 1843.

For clarification and the interest of tourists, the border is made visible on all streets with iron pins. This way it is always clear whether one is in Belgium (Baarle-Hertog) or in the Netherlands (Baarle-Nassau). This is also visible on the house numbers: the style of house numbers is different in both countries, and often the Dutch or Belgian flag next to the house number indicates which country it belongs to.

===Localities===
*Baarle-Nassau (population: 5,330)
*Ulicoten (1,110)
*Castelré (140)

===List of enclaves===
====Dutch enclaves====
These are all part of Baarle-Nassau municipality.

====Belgian enclaves====
These are all part of Baarle-Hertog municipality, and are surrounded by Baarle-Nassau municipality (Netherlands).

== Education ==
Baarle-Nassau has two primary schools: Basisschool De Uilenpoortand and Bernardusschool, the latter in the Ulicoten section. There is a single secondary school in Baarle-Nassau, De La Salle, which has , lower , and levels.

It shares, with Baarle-Hertog, a joint library with Belgian and Dutch staff.

== Notable people ==

* Petrus Christus ( in Baarle – 1475/1476) an Early Netherlandish painter; was a leading painter after the death of Jan van Eyck
* Jan Hendrikx (born 1944) a former Dutch politician, mayor of Baarle-Nassau 1990–2012

<doc id="118703" wikidata="Q192508" url="?curid=118703" title="Bergen op Zoom">
<text>Bergen op Zoom (; called &quot;Berrege&quot; in the local dialect) is a city and municipality in southwestern Netherlands. It is located in the province of North Brabant, at the provincial border with Zeeland. In January 2021, the municipality had a population of 67,514.

== Etymology ==
The city was built on a site where two types of soil meet: sandy soil and marine clay. The sandy soil pushed against the marine clay, accumulating and forming hills over several centuries. People called those hills the &quot;Brabantse Wal&quot;, literally meaning &quot;ramparts of Brabant&quot;. &quot;Zoom&quot; refers to the border of these ramparts and &quot;bergen&quot; in Dutch means mountains or hills. The name has nothing to do with the little channel, the Zoom, which was later built through Bergen op Zoom.

== History ==
Bergen op Zoom was granted city status probably in 1212. In 1287 the city and its surroundings became a lordship as it was separated from the lordship of Breda. The lordship was elevated to a margraviate in 1559. Several noble families, including the House of Glymes, ruled Bergen op Zoom in succession until 1795, although the title was only nominal since at least the seventeenth century.

During the early modern period, Bergen op Zoom was a very strong fortress and one of the main armories and arsenals of the United Provinces. It had a remarkable natural defensive site, surrounded as it was by marshes and easily flooded polders. Furthermore, it could receive reinforcements and supplies by sea, if the besieging army did not have a fleet to blockade its port.

Due to these features, the city was one of the strategic points held by the Dutch during their revolt in the Eighty Years War, beginning in the late sixteenth century. It was at that time besieged by Alessandro Farnese first in 1588, and by Ambrosio Spinola a second time in 1622. Both sieges were unsuccessful, and Bergen op Zoom got the nickname &quot;La Pucelle&quot; or &quot;The Virgin&quot; as it was never successfully taken in a siege.

In 1747, during the War of the Austrian Succession, the French army laid siege to the city. Bergen op Zoom had been fortified by new works built at the beginning of the 17th century by Menno van Coehoorn, with three forts surrounding the city and a canalized diversion of the Scheldt acting as a ditch around its walls. However, it had no second line of fortifications, nor any fortress. After seventy days of siege, the city was taken and thoroughly sacked; the garrison was slaughtered.

During the War of the Sixth Coalition, the town was again besieged by the British in March 1814 in a failed attempt to dislodge the French garrison.

===Trading town===
During the reign of Jan II van Glymes (1417–1494), nicknamed &quot;Jan metten Lippen&quot; (meaning &quot;Jan with the big lips&quot;, probably caused by an infection), a surge in economic growth occurred in the city. Large fairs were held twice a year, in spring and fall, that were known both nationally and internationally. Merchants from all over Europe came to Bergen op Zoom to sell their goods.

Because of this major economic growth, the Sint-Gertrudischurch was enlarged. The enlargement was called the &quot;Nieuw Werck&quot; but was never finished, because of the economic recession of the mid-16th century. It fell into ruin. The economic recession was largely caused by the poor accessibility of the port, due to a number of floods in Zeeland and West-Brabant. Because of the great reliance on the port, the economic growth received a major blow. In addition, the modernization of trade techniques, such as establishing of a permanent stock exchange instead of the fairs, which took place twice a year, also damaged the local economy.

The fairs continued until 1910. Despite the end of the two big fairs, Bergen op Zoom still hosts all kinds of smaller fairs and events.

===Religion===
During the Eighty Years&#x27; War, Bergen op Zoom chose the side of the Dutch Republic, and, simultaneously, Protestantism. The Catholics of the city either adapted or moved to the surrounding countryside, which remained largely Catholic. The inhabitants who chose to stay Catholic went to church in secret barns and houses, since the local Sint-Getrudischurch was assigned to the Protestant community.

Slowly, most of the city council members of Bergen op Zoom became Protestant. Protestants dominated the council until the 18th century. After that, the number of Catholics in Bergen op Zoom increased and, during the second part of the 18th century, a majority of Bergen op Zoom&#x27;s population was Catholic again. Although the Catholics enjoyed religious freedom during the French period in 1795–1814, their emancipation did not take place until later.

In 1832, a Catholic parish, the ‘Heilige Maagd ten Ophemeling’, was allowed to have its own church. In the same period, the Jewish community built a synagogue for their use. 

In 1972, the Protestant community, after the loss of many members, gave the Sint-Getrudischurch to the Catholic parish. Since the return of the Church, Catholic services have been held here again.

As a result of Turkish and Moroccan immigration to the Netherlands, the city has a significant Muslim minority.

<text>Bernheze () is a municipality in the southern Netherlands, in the province of North Brabant. It was formed as a rename of Heesch in 1995. The municipalities of Heeswijk-Dinther and Nistelrode had merged into Heesch in 1994.

==Etymology==
The municipality was named after an old farm &quot;Bernhese&quot;, which came into the possession of the Berne Abbey. This abbey was situated in the village of Bern. The meaning of &#x27;Bernhese&#x27; is twofold: &#x27;Bern&#x27; is the same as the old-Dutch word &#x27;born&#x27;, that means &#x27;water&#x27; or &#x27;well&#x27;. &#x27;Hese&#x27; means bush or forest. In 1857 the Berne Abbey was founded in Heeswijk.

<doc id="118705" wikidata="Q9816" url="?curid=118705" title="Best, Netherlands">
<text>Best () is a municipality and a village in the province of North Brabant, southern Netherlands. It is situated northwest of the city Eindhoven, and is part of Brabant&#x27;s city region.

The headquarters of one of Europe&#x27;s largest meat processors, Vion NV, are located in Best, as are Philips Healthcare and the Bata Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Bata Protective&quot; operations (B2B).

==History==
The village used to be a part of Oirschot, a nearby town. But as Best was situated on the state road from Amsterdam to Maastricht, this often created difficulties. Each time the military wanted to quarter troops in Best, they had to request to be stationed in Oirschot, 10 km away, for this to be allowed. Because of this difficulty, the government decided to separate Best from Oirschot in 1819.

Archaeological excavations around the village suggest settlement in the area dating back to the Roman era. The Armenhoef is a monumental farm on the Oirschotseweg 117 in Best.
This stable is the oldest still in use within Western Europe. Historical building research in 2009 showed that the wooden frame of the stable dates back to 1263. The residential part of the farm is more recent, and was built in 1640 at the earliest, but probably around 1680. The farm is an official monument.
The first written text about Best dates back to 1421.

The village itself, however, did not exist until the 19th century. There were three small villages: Naastenbest in the west, Wilhelminadorp in the south and Verrenbest where Oranjestraat is located. They grew together, and formed the village with the name Best.

Best received a railway station on the line Rotterdam – Breda – Boxtel – Helmond – Venlo – Maastricht. The line had only one track, but traffic congestion necessitated another track, so it was made double-tracked. In the 1980s, congestion once again became a problem so two more tracks were added in 2002. It is now possible to travel to Best from Utrecht or Eindhoven by train.

The spoken language is North Meierijs (an East Brabantian dialect, which is very similar to colloquial Dutch).

==Transport==
For train transport, see Best railway station.

One can take bus number 9 from Eindhoven central station to Best, or bus numbers 141/142 from Tilburg central station to Best.

* Ralf Mackenbach (born 1995 in Best) Dutch singer and dancer, winner of the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2009

<text>Boekel () is a municipality and a town in the southern Netherlands.

== Etymology ==

Previously it was assumed the name Boekel referred to the forest (&quot;loo&quot; in Dutch) of the lords Boc, similar to places like Boxmeer and Boxtel. The lords Boc were the first lords of Boxmeer, but have no connection to the other two places.

Currently, it is presumed that the name derives from &quot;Beukeloo&quot;, which is a type of beech forest.

==History==

=== Land van Herpen ===
Boekel was founded at some point in the Middle Ages as a settlement with a number of farms.

In the 13th century Boekel was part of de heerlijkheid Uden. In 1233 a separation took place between the Land van Cuijk and the and Uden. At that time Uden, together with Herpen, formed a unit of government called a heerlijkheid. Until the foundation of the city of Ravenstein, Herpen was the main city of this region. Rutger van Herpen sold or leased in 1313 or 1314 the community rights (&quot;gemene gronden&quot;) to the residents of Boekel and Volkel. When the noble lord wanted to improve his cash position, he charged the use of any of its soil, beginning with the wasteland in his heerlijkheid. This &quot;common land&quot; was mainly marshy land and barren higher grounds, such as heaths.

=== Land of Ravenstein ===
In 1324 the heerlijkheid of Uden administratively belonged to the Land of Ravenstein, under the rule of the House of Valkenburg until 1396.

From the aldermen Herpen and Uden the &quot;Heikantsgericht&quot; was created in 1339. These stretched across the entire former heerlijkheid of Uden, consisting of Uden, Boekel and Zeeland. Of these aldermen, which in total had seven members, two were from Boekel.

Reinoud of Valkenburg (married to Elisabeth van Kleef) died childless so the Duke of Brabant Adolf van Kleef gained Herpen, Ravenstein and Uden, so in 1397 Kleef&#x27;s territory was enlarged. Afterwards the area came under the rule of Neuburg-Palts in 1629. Under the Neubergers&#x27; rule, the area had religious freedom.

Because the neighboring provinces of Brabant and Gelderland from 1648 officially fell under the States-General, this more and more was seen as &quot;foreign&quot;. The religious freedom provided opportunities for Catholics in the States of Brabant. The Catholics of Erp built their own barn church on the border with Boekel. Due to the religious freedom several Catholic religious orders also settled in the Land of Ravenstein. In 1741 members of the Brothers Penitent, from the &quot;Handelse Kluis&quot; themselves wanted to settle in Boekel. Led by the brothers laid the foundation for the Psychiatric Hospital Huize Padua.

From the 17th century various conflicts arose among the villages of Boekel, Uden and Gemert around the demarcation lines between the Ravenstein, Cuijk and Gemert areas. In 1663 the boundary dispute with the &quot;Vrije Heerlijkheid Gemert&quot; was settled. In 1729, a similar problem with Uden was settled.

<text>Deurne () is a rural municipality and eponymous village in the province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. Including the villages of Liessel, Vlierden, Neerkant, and Helenaveen, Deurne had a population of in and covers an area of .

== History ==
First recorded as &quot;Durninum&quot; (near / by thorns) in a deed of gift from the Frankish Lord Herelaef to bishop Willibrord in 721, Deurne remained a collection of subsistence farming hamlets west of the Peel peat moor until the 19th century, when a newly built railroad (Eindhoven - Venlo in 1866) and a canal (Zuid-Willemsvaart canal in 1826) enabled the commercial exploitation of the moor. Although the peat industry did not yield much of a profit in the era of coal-powered industries, the cultivation of the newly cleared land, in the 1930s also by forced labour, gave a boost to agriculture, farming, and settlement alike. Today only tiny pieces of this former peat moor remain, some reflooded as mini wetlands, scattered along the fault line that once brought about its very existence.

Coincidentally, the very same Anglo Dutch Griendtsveen Peat Moss Litter Company Ltd. that extracted a significant part of the peat in the Peel moved to Thorne (Moorends) South Yorkshire, U.K., where several of its Dutch employees settled as immigrant workers.

== Culture ==
In 2009 the new &quot;Cultural Centre&quot; (&quot;cultureel centrum&quot;) opened its doors. It is the Martien van Doorne Cultuur Centrum and serves as a theatre, concert hall, and movie theatre.

The local dialect is Peellands (an East Brabantian dialect, which is very similar to colloquial Dutch).

<text>Eersel () is a municipality and a town in southern Netherlands in the province of North Brabant. Eersel is situated in the Campine (Kempen) area.

Eersel is part of the Acht Zaligheden (Eight Beatitudes) and known for its attractive market. This market, together with the Hint, has been declared a protected village on 19 October 1967. This has been done to guarantee the future survival of its authentic character.

The spoken language is Kempenlands (an East Brabantian dialect, which is very similar to colloquial Dutch).

== Population centres ==

== History ==
About 3,500 years ago the first inhabitants of the area of Eersel were builders of sepulchre hillocks or burial mounds of the Tumulus culture. Following them in the late Bronze Age the people of the Urnfield culture continued living there as has been proved by the urn with cremating ashes that has been found in ‘Schadewijk’. Before the Romans occupied this area, which they called Toxandria, the Eburones lived here. From the Roman period there are also archaeological finds. Many shards of Roman pottery are found between the church of Eersel and the hamlet ‘Schadewijk’. The Salian Franks that settled the area in the 4th century became known as Toxandrians. After the Roman time the region has been virtually depopulated.

The Franks established themselves round 700 again in the region. They lived where high and lower grounds were laying close to each other. One of those high grounds was Ereslo. As from this time there is a form of government authority in this area. The Franks build their farms around a triangular square. This kind of settlement was called a domain which was the property of the high nobility of the Franks.

The oldest known written indication of Eersel is found in the manuscript Codex Aureus of Echternach (or Liber Aureus) of the Abbey of Echternach. In this document is a charter included in which a certain Aengilbertus, son of late Gaobertus, with approval of his brother Verengaotus gives the property of the domain Eresloch to Saint Willibrord. 
In this registration of the year 712 the name of ‘Ereslo’ was transferred wrong to ‘Eresloch’. 
Wilibrord on his behalf gave the heritage to the Abbey of Echternach in Luxembourg.
To approximately the year 1000 Eersel belonged to the county of Taxandria.
Thereafter it came under the influence of earl of Guelders. The Earl of Leuven extends its area to the north and in 1203 the region definitively became a part of Brabant. Trading started to develop and Eersel became a cross point for the routes of Leuven and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and of Antwerp and Turnhout. The triangular court of the village &#x27;Hint&#x27; (now still visible), was extended in southern direction. The new oval square became ‘de Markt’ (the Market) constructed for the trade as a parking place for carts. Around arose the characteristic buildings for digest and boardinghouses such as taverns. But also stables for horses with the requirements like a blacksmith.
In 1325 Eersel obtained the rights of ‘freedom’ (Town privileges) from Duke Jan III of Brabant. On this basis the inhabitants could designate as of now their own governor. Eersel became the head of regional schepenbank of Hapert, Hoogeloon, Vessem, Knegsel, Steensel, Bergeijk, Westerhoven, Dommelen en Borkel en Schaft.

Around the 14th century Eersel became prosperous and the monumental tower of Eersel was built, together with those of Steensel and Duizel. In 1464 between the market and ‘het Hint’ a chapel was built in Eersel.

After the Middle Ages the region became more poorly and the villages did not grow between 1500 and 1800. This is the period of the ‘Teuten’ a traveling trading people, who were touring from village to village with artisan and merchant services, like coppersmith, wig-maker, also some veterinary surgeon like horse, ram, bull and pig castrating, and trade in goods like pottery, kitchen-utensil, bed-clothes, linen, lace, silk and other textile manufactures. They were no gypsies but build their homes in a central place like Eersel and traveled to other regions and lands from there. One of the remainder of this time are the houses of the ‘Teuten’ at the market. In 1800 at the time of King Willem I there came some improvement. The provincial road to Eindhoven and the road to Postel was hardened and a steam tram railway was manufactured. (1897)

In 1923 Eersel absorbed the former municipality of Duizel en Steensel. Since 1900 the reclaiming of cleared bush ground had taken place and the rise of the cigar industry. During the crisis, the cigar industry ensured that unemployment was not very large, although the living then in Eersel was reasonable poverty. Eersel still enjoys a reputation as one of the largest cigar exporters of the Netherlands and takes still an important place on the world market of cigar producers. After the Second World War there was a fast increase of population from 3,700 to 12,500 inhabitants in Eersel.

== Places of interest ==
* The church of Saint Willibrord 
The original version of the church of Eersel was a simply wooden cottage and was possibly founded by the (Catholic) abbey of Echternach . The church was mentioned for the first time in 1480. Tower dates from second half of the 14th century. The flaunting piece of the church is the monumental organ. It was entirely restored in 1972, under realm monument care. It is a combination of work of two famous organ builders: Bernard Petrus van Hirtum from Hilvarenbeek (1838) and the Smits Brothers from Reek (1852).

* The Chapel of Our Lady of Campina
It is built in 1464 in Gothic style and is the oldest building of the market. After the Peace of Münster it was closed for mass service and was used as Council house, as prison and repository for the fire-engine. 
It was used for 300 years as a townhall up to 1948 before it was returned to the church and used as a chapel again.

* Protestant church
The church was built first in 1812, and has been rebuilt in 1861. It is a simple barge stone build church. The ceiling has an arbor, what gives it a very good acoustic.

<text>Etten-Leur () is a municipality in the Dutch province North Brabant. Its name is a combination of the two villages from which the municipality originally arose: Etten and Leur.

==History==
The villages were always part of one municipality, originally called &quot;Etten c.a.&quot; (cum annexis), this later to change to &quot;Etten en Leur&quot;. The current name was adopted in 1968. By that time, the villages had grown into one. 

Both villages, created in the Middle Ages, were relatively prosperous during the period of the Dutch Republic, the exception being the period of the Eighty Years&#x27; War in which the area was a major battleground. This prosperity was caused by the fact that Etten was a centre for the production of peat, and Leur was a local trading port, as it had a harbour.

Decline in economic importance marked both villages during the nineteenth century. In 1836 Arnold Damen left Leur in order to work as a missionary in the United States. The painter Vincent van Gogh briefly lived in Etten, making him the most famous citizen in the history of Etten and Leur. During World War II, the two villages were freed from German occupation in late October 1944 by elements of the U.S. 104th Infantry Division.

The economic decline was halted when, in 1950, the Dutch government decided to encourage population growth and industrial development. As a result of this development, both towns have grown towards each other and merged into one: Etten-Leur.

<text>Geertruidenberg () is a city and municipality in the province North Brabant in the south of the Netherlands. The city, named after Saint Gertrude of Nivelles, received city rights in 1213 from the count of Holland. The fortified city prospered until the 15th century.

Today, the municipality of Geertruidenberg includes the population centres Raamsdonk and Raamsdonksveer. The municipality has a total area of and had a population of in . The city government consists of the mayor and three aldermen.

==History==
Geertruidenberg is named after Saint Gertrude of Nivelles.

In 1213, Sint Geertruidenberg (English: &quot;Saint Gertrude&#x27;s Mountain&quot;) received city rights from Count William I of Holland. The fortified city became a trade center, where counts and other nobility gathered for negotiations. In 1323–1325, Geertruidenberg Castle was constructed very close to the city center. 

During the Hook and Cod wars, the city chose the Cod side in 1351, while the castle remained on the Hook side. This led to the 1350–1351 Siege of Geertruidenberg. In 1420 a similar siege during a later Hook and Cod war caused huge damage to the city. The Saint Elizabeth&#x27;s flood of 1421 then ended the prosperity of Geertruidenberg.

In 1573, during the Eighty Years War, the city was captured in a surprise attack by an English, French Huguenot and Fleming force. In 1589 however the city was betrayed to Parma by its English garrison. It was finally recaptured by an Anglo-Dutch force under the command of Maurice of Nassau in the summer of 1593.

Today, Geertruidenberg is part of the province of North Brabant, but it was once part of the county of Holland. Geertruidenberg is the second oldest city of Holland as it was the first to receive city rights. It is a common misconception that Geertruidenberg is the oldest city of the Netherlands, because the names Holland and the Netherlands are used interchangeably by some.

==Geography==

The municipality of Geertruidenberg comprises three population centres:
*Geertruidenberg
*Raamsdonk
*Raamsdonksveer

Geertruidenberg is located on the bank of the Donge, close to where this river flows into the Amer.

==Government==

The mayor of Geertruidenberg is Marian Witte who, like all mayors in the Netherlands, was appointed by the Dutch monarch. She is supported by four aldermen who, with the mayor, form the &quot;College van Burgemeester en Wethouders&quot;.

The city council is elected every four years, at the same time as most other Dutch municipalities. The 19 members of the city council assemble ten times per year for public meetings in the city hall in Raamsdonksveer. The council members come from seven political parties, four local and three national (2022):

In the area of Geldrop, where over 10,000 years ago reindeerhunters of the so-called Ahrensburg culture placed their tents, two with engravings have been found, among other artefacts. On one of them a reindeerhorn have been represented, on the other one a dancing little girl, who is called &#x27;venus van Mierlo&#x27;. In the south of Zesgehuchten (district of Geldrop) finds have been done which indicate on small settlements from the New Stone Age (round 3000 BC). Finds from the Roman Time and the early Middle Ages have been found off Genoenhuis and Hoog Geldrop (districts in Geldrop). In the autumn of 1989 nearby &#x27;t Zand (cemetery) archaeological unearthings has been carried out. These had a remarkable result. Four settlements were found from the late Roman Time and the Middle Ages: a period which covers the years between 350 and 1225.

<text>Haaren () is a town and former municipality in the southern Netherlands, in the province of North Brabant.

The former municipality of Haaren ceased to exist on 1 January 2021. It was divided among four municipalities: Boxtel, Oisterwijk, Tilburg, and Vught.

The former municipality of Haaren contained three other villages: Helvoirt, Esch, and Biezenmortel. An unusual thing about the municipality was that it belonged to two regions, Tilburg and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. The village belongs to the region of Tilburg. The eastern part of national park the Loonse en Drunense Duinen was part of the municipality.

Haaren is known as &#x27;The Garden of Brabant&#x27; because of the many plantations of trees, plants etc.

<text>Heusden () is a municipality and a city in the south of the Netherlands. It is located between the towns of Waalwijk and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. The municipality of Heusden, including Herpt, Heesbeen, Hedikhuizen, Doeveren, and Oudheusden, merged with Drunen and Vlijmen in 1997, giving the municipality its current form.

The middle part of national park the Loonse en Drunense Duinen is located in the municipality of Heusden.

== Population centres ==


== Heusden town ==
Before 1997, Heusden was a municipality in itself, that included the communities of Herpt, Heesbeen, Hedikhuizen, Doeveren, and Oudheusden.

=== Castle ===

The settlement of Heusden on the river Maas (Meuse) started with the construction of Heusden Castle, which replaced an earlier castle destroyed by Henry I, Duke of Brabant in 1202. This fortification was quickly expanded with water works and a donjon (castle keep). The city of Heusden received city rights in 1318. Heusden&#x27;s castle had belonged to successive dukes of Brabant; in 1357 it passed into the hands of the counts of Holland. Ramparts and moats were constructed, bringing the castle within the city&#x27;s fortifications and resulting in the loss of its function as a stronghold. The donjon was then used as a munition depot. On 24 July 1680, a terrible thunderstorm hit Heusden, and lightning struck the donjon. Sixty thousand pounds of gunpowder and other ammunition exploded, destroying the castle. It took seven weeks to clear the rubble and debris. The castle was never fully rebuilt. However, outlines of the main features were restored in 1987.

=== Fortifications and restoration ===
At the beginning of the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648), Heusden was occupied by the Spanish. In 1577, however, following the Pacification of Ghent, the people of Heusden allied with William, Prince of Orange. William consolidated the town&#x27;s strategic position near the river Meuse, and ordered fortification works to be constructed. Work started in 1579 with the digging of moats and the construction of bastions, walls, and ravelins, and was completed in 1597.

By the early nineteenth century, the defence works fell into disrepair and were dismantled. In 1968, however, extensive restoration works started, and fortifications were carefully rebuilt, based on and inspired by a 1649 map of the city of Heusden by Johannes Blaeu, son of the famous Dutch cartographer Willem Blaeu. In 1980, the city of Heusden received the European Urbes Nostrae restoration prize. Heusden currently draws over 350 thousand tourists every year who visit the historic town centre and walk the walls that once made it a formidable stronghold.

=== Heusden Town Hall Massacre ===
In October 1944, towards the end of World War II, the cities of Tilburg and &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch (Den Bosch) were liberated by the Allied forces. The bridge across the river Meuse made Heusden, then still occupied by the Germans, strategically significant. The cellars of the old town hall, built in 1588, were a shelter for civilians during artillery fire. The German Wehrmacht used the building as a communication centre and hospital.

A few weeks after Operation Market Garden, the allied Operation Pheasant started on 20 October 1944. The First Canadian Army (advancing from Belgium) and the 2nd British Army (advancing from the east) fought to liberate central and western North Brabant. On Saturday 4 November, under heavy artillery fire, two Scottish Highlander regiments advanced, and 170 civilians sought shelter in the town hall cellars. In the early morning of 5 November, three German army engineers detonated explosive charges they had placed earlier in the 40-metre tower. It collapsed, killing 134 people. Heusden was decimated. One tenth of the town&#x27;s population died that night in the town hall cellars. Seventy-four victims, i.e. more than half of the total number, were children aged 16 or younger. Only hours later, the 5th battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders from the 51st Highland Division liberated Heusden.

Witnesses have stated that on 4 November German soldiers carried explosives into the town hall tower, and also into two churches, a windmill, and dairy factory in Heusden. NCO (non-commissioned officer) Bottnick, who was probably following orders from commander Pfühl, a mining engineer, undermined the eastern part of the tower, ensuring that it would collapse on the town hall, not on the street. Later, these events were investigated by the British Civil Affairs. However, this has never resulted in the trial and punishment of Pfühl, Bottnick, and their accomplices.

A new town hall was erected in 1956. Designed and built in the style of the Bossche School, it has much less splendour than its late-gothic predecessor. A memorial tablet in the forecourt still remembers the lives that were lost in the night of 4 to 5 November 1944. Its inscription: &quot;&quot;Wandelaar, waar gij staat vielen vijf november 1944 honderd vier en dertig burgers den oorlog ten offer.&quot; (&quot;Passer-by, where you are, on five November 1944 one hundred and thirty four civilians fell victim to the war.&quot;)

Inscriptions on one of the larger bells in the tower &quot;Nabestaanden, als ik luid, weet: Uw vele, vele doden zijn niet oorlogs droeve buit, maar aan &#x27;t Gastmaal Gods genoden.&quot; (&quot;Relatives, when I ring, know: Your many, many decedents are not the sad spoils of war, but the guests of God&#x27;s banquet.&quot;), and an epitaph &quot;5 November 1944. Hier staat in steen geschreven geen daad of droom, geen leven, maar slechts het blijvend feit van hun afwezigheid&quot; (&quot;5 November 1944. Here is written in stone no act or dream, no life, but only the permanent fact of their absence&quot;&quot;) in the building itself are also dedicated to the memory of the victims.

The massacre (&quot;Stadhuisramp&quot;) is commemorated every year.

With the fusion of the municipalities of Heusden, Drunen and Vlijmen in 1997, the town hall had lost its original function. Since 2005, the building has housed a visitors centre.

<text>Lith () is a village in the province North Brabant in the Netherlands. Before 2011, there was also a municipality; since 2011 Lith is a part of Oss.

== History ==
Lith was first mentioned in 1202 as Litte. The etymology is unknown. Lith developed on a fordable location on the Maas. A harbour has been known to exist at Lith since 968. Originally it was part of the Duchy of Brabant. Later it became part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. In 1672, it was conquered by the Dutch Republic.

The Dutch Reformed church dated from the Middle Ages, but was destroyed by a V-1 flying bomb in 1945. The church was rebuilt in 1953. The Catholic St Lambertus Church was built 1899 and 1900 and has a slender needle spire. The grist mill Zeldenrust was built around 1800. It remained in service until 1972, and bought by the municipality in 1973. The wind mill is occasionally in use.

Lith was home to 1,279 people in 1840. Lith was an independent municipality until 1958 when it was merged into Alem, Maren en Kessel. In 2011, it became part of the municipality of Oss.

=== Loon op Zand ===

Loon op Zand is the oldest village of the municipality. Somewhere around the year 1000, this village was founded in a very wet and swampy area. There was also a lot of drift-sand whose origin, according to geological experts, dates back to the last ice age. As of this moment, Loon op Zand has the biggest driftsand area in all of western Europe. Historically, the presence of this driftsand has caused the relocation of the village on several times. Hinerland farmers build many sandy embankments or levies to protect their land against the ceaseless drifting sand.

The presence of this driftsand explains the name of Loon op Zand. Before 1391, a village called &#x27;Venloon&#x27; was situated just a few hundred metres to the north-east of the current village of Loon op Zand. After the villagers relocated in 1391, they called their new village &#x27;Venloon op &#x27;t Zant&#x27; (Venloon on the Sand), which over the years changed to &#x27;Loon op Zand&#x27;.

For 200 years, Loon op Zand and Kaatsheuvel were the centre of the leather tanning and shoe manufacturing industry of the region. There were a lot of factories; most of these were in people&#x27;s backyards. There were some big shoe manufacturers, such as Van Lier. This world-famous shoe brand originated in Loon op Zand. Just prior to the new millennium, Van Lier abandoned their factory in Loon op Zand and moved to a bigger factory in Breda.

<text>Mierlo is a village in the southern Netherlands, in the municipality of Geldrop-Mierlo, North Brabant. Until 2004, it was a separate municipality with an area of .

Mierlo is home to a few interesting buildings, for example the old Council house and the windmill in the centre of the village. Sports clubs in Mierlo are Mifano and the Hockey Club. Just to the south, separated by the A67 motorway, lies the Strabrechtse Heide.

Mierlo is situated in the urban area of Eindhoven and Helmond. But it has many green areas. It lies on the edge of forests, moorlands and fields.

== History ==
The oldest inhabitants of the area that we have any knowledge of were the reindeer hunters. In 1961, a piece of sandstone, dated at around 9,000B.C. was discovered on the heath between Mierlo and Geldrop. On this stone a half-naked dancing female figure was etched, which is now known as the &#x27;Venus of Mierlo.&#x27; It is the oldest artistic expression ever found in the Netherlands.

The village was first mentioned in 1245 as Henricus de Mirle, and is a combination of the words for moorland and open forest. Mierlo developed in the 12th century near a castle. The castle was rebuilt in 1210 after it was destroyed, and collapsed in a storm in 1800.

The Catholic St. Lucia Church was built between 1856 and 1858. Part of the tower of the medieval church was incorporated in the new church. The nameless grist mill of Mierlo was built around 1640. It was moved in 1860 and 1992. It was restored several times and nowadays only used occasionally.

Mierlo was home to 466 people in 1840. Mierlo was an independent municipality. In 1968, the village Mierlo-Hout was transferred to Helmond. In 2003 when it was merged into Geldrop-Mierlo.

In 2004, Mierlo acquired a zoo named &#x27;Eindhoven Zoo&#x27; near the Gulbergen. This zoo initially began under the name &#x27;Dierenrijk Europa,&#x27; featuring animals ranging from polar bears to apes from Gibraltar, as well as beavers that had been reintroduced in the Netherlands. When non-European animals, such as elephants and camels, were also introduced, the name was changed to &#x27;Dierenrijk&#x27; and later &#x27;Eindhoven Zoo&#x27;.

<text>Moerdijk () is a municipality and a town in the South of the Netherlands, in the province of North Brabant.

== History ==
The municipality of Moerdijk was founded in 1997 following the merger of the municipalities of Fijnaart en Heijningen, Klundert, Standdaarbuiten, Willemstad, and Zevenbergen. At that time the new municipality was called Zevenbergen. The name changed to Moerdijk on 1 April 1998.

===Topography===
&quot;Dutch Topographic map of the municipality of Moerdijk, June 2015&quot;

=== The village of Moerdijk ===
The village of Moerdijk is one of the smaller villages of the municipality. Population as of 2002 is 1,205. &quot;Moerdijk&quot; is however a well-known name in the Netherlands, because of the large Moerdijk industrial area, with a large power plant, and because of the well-known Moerdijk bridges (highway and railway bridges) across the Hollands Diep. This was the last bridge available for the retreat from the vital Scheldt Estuary of the rapidly collapsing German defences near Antwerp in World War II. (Noteworthy as well, the Moerdijk bridges were one of the first targets of guided, or &quot;smart bombs&quot;- by American heavy bombers in late 1944.) 

Moerdijk made headlines on 5 January 2011 because of a large fire at Chemie-Pack (a firm processing numerous chemicals) causing a large cloud of toxic smoke to blow over the surrounding area, mostly to the north of Moerdijk.

&quot;Above the Moerdijk&quot; (meaning &quot;north of Moerdijk&quot;) is used as an expression in Belgium and the southern parts of the Netherlands to mean &quot;in the Netherlands&quot; or &quot;in Holland&quot;.

&quot;Below the Moerdijk&quot; (meaning &quot;south of Moerdijk&quot; or &quot;below the major rivers&quot;) is also a Dutch expression for the Catholic provinces North Brabant and Limburg. This expression is used particularly around Mardi Gras in relation to the region&#x27;s traditional carnival culture, which (with a few local exceptions) does not exist north of the major rivers.

&quot;Over de Moerdijk&quot; (meaning &quot;across the Moerdijk&quot;) is used by either party to mean the other one.

=== Zevenbergen ===
Zevenbergen is the largest town of the municipality (population : 14,006). It is located about 10 km northwest of Breda. It received city rights in 1427.

Zevenbergen has a train station with connections to Dordrecht and Roosendaal.

== Transport ==

Close to Hollands Diep, the area is now used for industrial movements by water, with great inland access as well the access into the North Sea, transport company Van der Vlist have their own port located in the area, and many other transport companies have nearby offices.

==Notable people==
===Vincent van Gogh===
Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) spent two years in Nuenen from 1883 to 1885. His father lived and worked there as the Protestant pastor in the largely catholic environment. Van Gogh lived in the small carriagehouse next to the beautiful pastor&#x27;s house, which is well preserved and visited by art lovers from all over the world. Van Gogh was extremely productive in his years in Nuenen. It is referred to as his so-called dark or sombre period. Here he painted his famous painting &quot;The Potato Eaters&quot; as well as &quot;Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen&quot; (&quot;Het uitgaan van de hervormde kerk te Nuenen&quot;). The latter painting was stolen from the Van Gogh Museum in December 2002.

===Edsger Dijkstra===
Edsger Dijkstra (1930–2002), Dutch computer scientist, then a professor in the Mathematics Department at the Technical University of Eindhoven, moved to a newly built house in Nuenen in 1964. Nuenen was added to the world map of computer science in 1973 when Dijkstra started to circulate his reports signed ‘Burroughs Research Fellow’ with his home address. Many thought that Burroughs, a company known at that time for the production of computers based on an innovative hardware architecture, was based in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs Corporation and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the USA. Dijkstra moved in 1984 to the University of Austin, Texas, USA, until his retirement in the autumn of 1999. Dijkstra returned from Austin, terminally ill, to his original house in Nuenen in February 2002, where he died half a year later, on 6 August 2002.

<text>A barn is an agricultural building usually on farms and used for various purposes. In North America, a barn refers to structures that house livestock, including cattle and horses, as well as equipment and fodder, and often grain. As a result, the term barn is often qualified e.g. tobacco barn, dairy barn, cow house, sheep barn, potato barn. In the British Isles, the term barn is restricted mainly to storage structures for cereals and fodder, the terms byre or shippon being applied to cow shelters, whereas horses are kept in buildings known as stables. In mainland Europe, however, barns were often part of integrated structures known as byre-dwellings (or housebarns in US literature). In addition, barns may be used for equipment storage, as a covered workplace, and for activities such as threshing.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;barn&quot; comes from the Old English , for barley (or grain in general), and , for a storage place—thus, a storehouse for barley. The word , also spelled &quot;bern&quot; and &quot;bearn&quot;, is attested to at least sixty times in homilies and other Old English prose. The related words &quot;bere-tun&quot; and &quot;bere-flor&quot; both meant threshing floor. &quot;Bere-tun&quot; also meant granary; the literal translation of &quot;bere-tun&quot; is &quot;grain enclosure&quot;. While the only literary attestation of &quot;bere-hus&quot; (also granary) comes from the &quot;Dialogi&quot; of Gregory the Great, there are four known mentions of &quot;bere-tun&quot; and two of &quot;bere-flor&quot;. &quot;A Thesaurus of Old English&quot; lists and (&quot;meal-store house&quot;) as synonyms for barn.

==History==
The modern barn largely developed from the three aisled medieval barn, commonly known as tithe barn or monastic barn. This, in turn, originated in a 12th-century building tradition, also applied in halls and ecclesiastical buildings. In the 15th century several thousands of these huge barns were to be found in Western Europe. In the course of time, its construction method was adopted by normal farms and it gradually spread to simpler buildings and other rural areas. As a rule, the aisled barn had large entrance doors and a passage corridor for loaded wagons. The storage floors between the central posts or in the aisles were known as bays or mows (from Middle French &quot;moye&quot;).

The main types were large barns with sideway passages, compact barns with a central entrance and smaller barns with a transverse passage. The latter also spread to Eastern Europe. Whenever stone walls were applied, the aisled timber frame often gave way to single-naved buildings. A special type were byre-dwellings, which included living quarters, byres and stables, such as the Frisian farmhouse or Gulf house and the Black Forest house. Not all, however, evolved from the medieval barn. Other types descended from the prehistoric longhouse or other building traditions. One of the latter was the Low German (hall) house, in which the harvest was stored in the attic. In many cases, the New World colonial barn evolved from the Low German house, which was transformed to a real barn by first generation colonists from the Netherlands and Germany.

==Construction==
In the Yorkshire Dales, England, barns, known locally as cowhouses were built from double stone walls with truffs or throughstones acting as wall ties.
In the U.S., older barns were built from timbers hewn from trees on the farm and built as a log crib barn or timber frame, although stone barns were sometimes built in areas where stone was a cheaper building material. In the mid to late 19th century in the U.S. barn framing methods began to shift away from traditional timber framing to &quot;truss framed&quot; or &quot;plank framed&quot; buildings. Truss or plank framed barns reduced the number of timbers instead using dimensional lumber for the rafters, joists, and sometimes the trusses. The joints began to become bolted or nailed instead of being mortised and tenoned. The inventor and patentee of the Jennings Barn claimed his design used less lumber, less work, less time, and less cost to build and were durable and provided more room for hay storage. Mechanization on the farm, better transportation infrastructure, and new technology like a hay fork mounted on a track contributed to a need for larger, more open barns, sawmills using steam power could produce smaller pieces of lumber affordably, and machine cut nails were much less expensive than hand-made (wrought) nails. Concrete block began to be used for barns in the early 20th century in the U.S.

Modern barns are more typically steel buildings. From about 1900 to 1940, many large dairy barns were built in northern USA. These commonly have gambrel or hip roofs to maximize the size of the hay loft above the dairy roof, and have become associated in the popular image of a dairy farm. The barns that were common to the wheatbelt held large numbers of pulling horses such as Clydesdales or Percherons. These large wooden barns, especially when filled with hay, could make spectacular fires that were usually total losses for the farmers. With the advent of balers it became possible to store hay and straw outdoors in stacks surrounded by a plowed fireguard. Many barns in the northern United States are painted barn red with a white trim. One possible reason for this is that ferric oxide, which is used to create red paint, was the cheapest and most readily available chemical for farmers in New England and nearby areas. Another possible reason is that ferric oxide acts a preservative and so painting a barn with it would help to protect the structure. The custom of painting barns in red with white trim is widely spread in Scandinavia. Especially in Sweden the Falu red with white trims is the traditional colouring of most wooden buildings.

With the popularity of tractors following World War II many barns were taken down or replaced with modern Quonset huts made of plywood or galvanized steel. Beef ranches and dairies began building smaller loftless barns often of Quonset huts or of steel walls on a treated wood frame (old telephone or power poles). By the 1960s it was found that cattle receive sufficient shelter from trees or wind fences (usually wooden slabs 20% open).

==Uses==

In older style North American barns, the upper area was used to store hay and sometimes grain. This is called the mow (rhymes with cow) or the hayloft. A large door at the top of the ends of the barn could be opened up so that hay could be put in the loft. The hay was hoisted into the barn by a system containing pulleys and a trolley that ran along a track attached to the top ridge of the barn. Trap doors in the floor allowed animal feed to be dropped into the mangers for the animals.

In New England it is common to find barns attached to the main farmhouse (connected farm architecture), allowing for chores to be done while sheltering the worker from the weather.

In the middle of the twentieth century the large broad roof of barns were sometimes painted with slogans in the United States. Most common of these were the 900 barns painted with ads for Rock City.

In the past barns were often used for communal gatherings, such as barn dances.

==Features==

A farm may have buildings of varying shapes and sizes used to shelter large and small animals and other uses. The enclosed pens used to shelter large animals are called stalls and may be located in the cellar or on the main level depending in the type of barn. Other common areas, or features, of an American barn include:
*a tack room (where bridles, saddles, etc. are kept), often set up as a breakroom
*a feed room, where animal feed is stored – not typically part of a modern barn where feed bales are piled in a stackyard
*a drive bay, a wide corridor for animals or machinery
*a silo where fermented grain or hay (called ensilage or haylage) is stored.
*a milkhouse for dairy barns; an attached structure where the milk is collected and stored prior to shipment
*a grain (soy, corn, etc.) bin for dairy barns, found in the mow and usually made of wood with a chute to the ground floor providing access to the grain, making it easier to feed the cows.
*modern barns often contain an indoor corral with a squeeze chute for providing veterinary treatment to sick animals.
*In North Yorkshire cowhouses would have a muck hole (muck’ole in the local dialect) to allow manure to be deposited outside the barn without the cowhand leaving the building.
*In North Yorkshire a cowhouse would have a small door or forking hole (forking’ole in the local dialect) high up on the wall to enable fodder to be &#x27;forked&#x27; into the baux or baulks (hayloft).
*Some English barns would have a gin gang, a semi-circular extension added to house a horse engine.

==Derivatives==
The physics term &quot;barn&quot;, which is a subatomic unit of area, 10−28 m2, came from experiments with uranium nuclei during World War II, wherein they were described colloquially as &quot;big as a barn&quot;, with the measurement officially adopted to maintain security around nuclear weapons research.

==Barn idioms==
*&quot;He couldn&#x27;t hit the broad side of a barn&quot; is a popular expression for a person having poor aim when throwing an object or when shooting at something.
*To &quot;lock the barn door after the horse has bolted&quot; implies that one has solved a problem too late to prevent it.
* &quot;Were you born/raised in a barn?&quot; is an accusation used differently in various parts of the English-speaking world, but most commonly as a reprimand when someone exhibits poor manners by either using ill-mannered language (particularly if related to manure), or leaving doors open.
*&quot;Your barn door is open&quot; is used as a euphemism to remind someone to zip the fly of their trousers.
*To &quot;barnstorm&quot; is to travel quickly around a large area making frequent public appearances.

==Types==
Barns have been classified by their function, structure, location, or other features. Sometimes the same building falls into multiple categories.
* Apple barn or fruit barn – for the storage of fruit crops
*Bank barn – A multilevel building built into a banking so the upper floor is accessible to a wagon, sometimes accessed by a bridge or ramp.
*Bastle house – a defensive structure to guard against raiders with accommodation on the lower floor for livestock.
* Bridge barn or covered bridge barn – general terms for barns accessed by a bridge rather than a ramp.
*Boô – A sheep-barn and dwelling in the Netherlands, seasonal or sometimes year round.
*Pennsylvania barn (U.S.) of which there are sub-categories such as &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;sweitzer&quot; types. Also known as &quot;forebay&quot; or &quot;porch barns&quot;.
*Cantilever barn – a type of log crib barn with cantilevered upper floors which developed in Appalachia (U.S.A.)
*Combination barn – found throughout England, especially in areas of pastoral farming and the standard barn type in America. This general term means the barns were used for both crop storage and as a byre to house animals.
*Crib barn – Horizontal log structures with up to four cribs (assemblies of crossing timbers) found primarily in the southern U.S.A.
*Drying barns for drying crops in Finland and Sweden are called &quot;riihi&quot; and &quot;ria&quot;, respectively.
*New World Dutch Barn – A barn type in the U.S. Also see &quot;Dutch barn (U.K.)&quot; in Other farm buildings section below.
*Field barn – An outbuilding located in a field further afield than the main cluster of buildings that constitute a farmstead
*New England barn – a common style of barn found in rural New England and in the U.S.
*English barn (U.S.), also called a Yankee or Connecticut barn – A widespread barn type in the U.S.
*Granary – to store grain after it is threshed, some barns contain a room called a granary, some barns like a rice barn blur the line between a barn and granary.
*Gothic arch barn, has profile shaped as a Gothic arch, which became feasible to be formed by laminated members
*Ground stable barn, a barn with space for livestock at ground level 
*Housebarn, also called a byre-dwelling – A combined living space and barn, relatively common in old Europe but rare in North America. Also, longhouses were housebarns.
*Pole barn – a simple structure that consists of poles embedded in the ground to support a roof, with or without exterior walls. The pole barn lacks a conventional foundation, thus greatly reducing construction costs. Traditionally used to house livestock, hay or equipment.
*Potato barn or potato house– A semi-subterranean or two story building for storage of potatoes or sweet potatoes.
*Prairie barn – A general term for barns in the Western U.S.
*Rice barn and the related winnowing barn
*Round barn, built in a round shape the term often is generalized to the include polygonal barn and octagonal barn
*Swing beam barn – A rare barn type in part of the U.S. designed for threshing with animals walking around a pole held by a &quot;swing beam&quot; inside the barn.
*Tobacco barn – for drying of tobacco leaves
*Tithe barn – a type of barn used in much of northern Europe in the Middle Ages for storing the tithes—a tenth of the farm&#x27;s produce which had to be given to the church
*Threshing barn – built with a threshing floor for the processing and storage of cereals, to keep them in dry conditions. Characterised by large double doors in the centre of one side, a smaller one on the other, and storage for cereal harvest or unprocessed on either side. In England the grain was beaten from the crop by flails and then separated from the husks by winnowing between these doors. The design of these typically remained unchanged between the 12th and 19th centuries. The large doors allow for a horse wagon to be driven through; the smaller ones allow for the sorting of sheep and other stock in the spring and summer.

==Other farm buildings often associated with barns==
*Carriage house: cart shed
* Dutch barn (U.K.): an open sided structure for hay storage. The type with a movable roof is called a hay barrack in the U.S or a &quot;hooiberg&quot; (&quot;kapberg&quot;) in the Netherlands.
* A corn crib a horizontal slatted structure built to allow airflow to dry corn (maize)
* A granary or hórreo: a storage space for threshed grains, sometimes within a barn or as a separate building.
* Linhay (linny, linney, linnies): A shed, often with a lean-to roof but may be a circular linhay to store hay on the first floor with either cattle on the ground floor (cattle linhay), or farm machinery (cart linhay). Characterised by an open front with regularly spaced posts or pillars.
* Milk room or milk house: to store milk.
*Oast houses: an outbuilding used for drying hops as part of the brewing process.
* Shelter sheds: open-fronted structures for stock
* Shippon: a shed which houses oxen and cattle. Has fodder storage above, regularly spaced doors on the yard side, a pitching door or window on the first floor.
* Stable: Usually for housing horses.

==Historic farm buildings==
Old farm buildings of the countryside contribute to the landscape, and help define the history of the location, i.e. how farming took place in the past, and how the area has been settled throughout the ages. They also can show the agricultural methods, building materials, and skills that were used. Most were built with materials reflecting the local geology of the area. Building methods include earth walling and thatching.

Buildings in stone and brick, roofed with tile or slate, increasingly replaced buildings in clay, timber and thatch from the later 18th century. Metal roofs started to be used from the 1850s. The arrival of canals and railways brought about transportation of building materials over greater distances.

Clues determining their age and historical use can be found from old maps, sale documents, estate plans, and from a visual inspection of the building itself, noting (for example) reused timbers, former floors, partitions, doors and windows.

The arrangement of the buildings within the farmstead can also yield valuable information on the historical farm usage and landscape value. Linear farmsteads were typical of small farms, where there was an advantage to having cattle and fodder within one building, due to the colder climate. Dispersed clusters of unplanned groups were more widespread. Loose courtyard plans built around a yard were associated with bigger farms, whereas carefully laid out courtyard plans designed to minimize waste and labour were built in the latter part of the 18th century.

The barns are typically the oldest and biggest buildings to be found on the farm. Many barns were converted into cow houses and fodder processing and storage buildings after the 1880s. Many barns had owl holes to allow for access by barn owls, encouraged to aid vermin control.

The stable is typically the second-oldest building type on the farm. They were well built and placed near the house due to the value that the horses had as draught animals

Modern granaries were built from the 18th century. Complete granary interiors, with plastered walls and wooden partitioning to grain bins, are very rare.

Longhouses are an ancient building where people and animals used the same entrance. These can still be seen, for example, in North Germany, where the Low Saxon house occurs.

Few interiors of the 19th century cow houses have survived unaltered due to dairy-hygiene regulations in many countries.

Old farm buildings may show the following signs of deterioration: rotting in timber-framed constructions due to damp, cracks in the masonry from movement of the walls, e.g. ground movement, roofing problems (e.g. outward thrust of it, deterioration of purlins and gable ends), foundation problems, penetration of tree roots; lime mortar being washed away due to inadequate weather-protection. Walls made of cob, earth mortars or walls with rubble cores are all highly vulnerable to water penetration, and replacement or covering of breathable materials with cement or damp-proofing materials may trap moisture within the walls.

In England and Wales some of these historical buildings have been given &quot;listed building&quot; status, which provides them some degree of archaeological protection.

Some grant schemes are available to restore Historic Farmland buildings, for example Natural England&#x27;s Environmental Stewardship, Countryside Stewardship and Environmentally Sensitive Areas Schemes.

<text>Oosterhout (; from &quot;ooster&quot;, &quot;eastern&quot;, and &quot;hout&quot;, &quot;woods&quot;) is a municipality and a city in southern Netherlands. The municipality had a population of in . 

== Population centers ==
The municipality of Oosterhout includes the following places:
==History==
Oosterhout is mentioned for the first time in 1277, although archaeological excavations showed the existence of human settlements in the area in prehistoric times. The Knights Templar had a temple here dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It was home to a castle which later acquired control over the surrounding area, up to Breda and Bergen op Zoom. The castle was destroyed by Spanish troops during the Eighty Years War, in 1573; only a tower of it survives today. 

The city became the seat of a flourishing ceramics industry, which lasted until the 19th century. In 1625 the city was besieged by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, and suffered heavy damage. 

Despite the rise of Protestantism, it was home to several Catholic monasteries, including that of the Premonstratensians, which is still active. Oosterhout received city rights in 1809, by will of Louis Bonaparte.

==Main sights==

<text>Ravenstein is a city and a former municipality in the south of the Netherlands, in the province of North Brabant. The former municipality covered an area of 42.68 km² (of which 0.96 km² water). In 2003 it was incorporated into the city of Oss.

Ravenstein was founded by Walraven van Valkenburg. It received city rights in 1380. From 1631 until 1796, Ravenstein and the surrounding area were part of the Duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg and was a Catholic enclave within the Dutch Republic.

== Land van Ravenstein ==
In 1360, Ravenstein became part of the , and received city rights in 1380. Philip of Cleves, Lord of Ravenstein died in 1528 without successors, and the land became part of the Duchy of Cleves. In 1609, it became part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg who sold the Dutch Republic the right to fortify Ravenstein and maintain troops in the city. In 1631, it changed hands to the Duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg, and became a Catholic enclave within the Dutch Republic. The Land van Ravenstein was conquered by France in 1794, and sold to the Batavian Republic (the predecessor of the Kingdom of the Netherlands) in 1800. In 1814, it became part of the province of North Brabant.

== History ==
In 1360, Ravenstein was founded by Walraven van Valkenburg who moved his castle from Herpen to the bank of the river Maas. In 1380, it received city rights and a wall was built around the city with three gates. The fortification were renewed between 1522 and 1526, but demolished in 1543 by order of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Around 1621, the city was refortified by the Dutch Republic. In 1630, the city became part of the Duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg, and a catholic enclave within the Dutch Republic. In 1635, a garrison of the Dutch Republic was stationed in Ravenstein and stayed until 1672. In 1794, Ravenstein was conquered by France and sold to the Batavian Republic in 1800. In 1818, the castle was demolished. In 1872, a railway station was built in Ravenstein and the city started to industrialise.

Ravenstein was home to 875 people in 1840. It was an independent municipality until 2003 when it was merged into Oss.

== Former municipality ==
Ravenstein also included the following towns, villages and townships: Demen, Dennenburg, Deursen, Dieden, Herpen, Huisseling, Keent, Koolwijk, Neerlangel, Neerloon, Overlangel.

Dieden, Demen en Langel was a separate municipality until 1923, when it was merged with Ravenstein.

<text>Sint-Oedenrode () is a town in the Dutch province of North Brabant.

Sint-Oedenrode is a moderately urbanized town in the Meierij of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. Sint-Oedenrode had a population of 18,360 as of and has an area of . On 1 January 2017 Sint-Oedenrode, together with Schijndel and Veghel, merged into a new municipality called Meierijstad, creating the largest municipality of the North-Brabant province in terms of land area.

The municipality traditionally had &quot;vrijheidsrechten&quot; (a predecessor of city rights), since 1232, until the abolishment of the privileges and introduction of the Municipalities Act in 1851. In those feudal times Sint-Oedenrode was referred to as a &quot;Vlek&quot; (market town). Today it is still a large town. From southeast to northwest, the town is split by the river Dommel.

==Population centers==

The municipality Sint-Oedenrode consists of several quarters and hamlets:
* 11 quarters in Sint-Oedenrode and 3 hamlets (&quot;Everse&quot;, &quot;Koevering&quot; and &quot;Kremselen&quot;)
* 1 quarter in Boskant and 3 hamlets (&quot;De Bus&quot;, &quot;Scheeken Vernhout&quot; and &quot;De Bunders&quot;)
* 1 quarter in Olland and 1 hamlet (&quot;Houthem&quot;)
* 1 quarter in Nijnsel and 2 hamlets (&quot;Vressel&quot; and &quot;Zwijnsbergen&quot;)

The town of Sint-Oedenrode consist of two historical urban cores: &quot;Sint-Oedenrode&quot; and &quot;Eerschot&quot;, which are separated by the Dommel.

==The origin of the name &#x27;Sint-Oedenrode&#x27;==

According to legend, Sint-Oedenrode owes its name to Saint Oda. 
The saga goes as follows:
This woman was a mythical blind-born Scottish, possibly Irish, daughter of king Eugenius VII, who around the year 700, along with a servant was sent on a pilgrimage on the mainland by her father. 
Oda&#x27;s blindness was miraculously cured after she visited the tomb of Saint Lambert of Maastricht in Liège. She decided she wanted to devote her life to the Christian God as a nun. She returned to her father who had decided a husband for her. Oda did not wish to marry as was her father&#x27;s wish. In a desperate attempt to not marry, she decided to flee to the mainland. She started to travel from one place to another, wherever she could find silence for worshipping. Her worship was repeatedly disrupted by magpies, and she fled from the birds.
Eventually she arrived in Toxandria (Austrasia) in a little settlement called Rode (old Dutch word for a man-made open place in the woods), where the villagers built her a hut on the heath and she settled there as a hermit. After she died in 726 A.D. the villagers were getting pilgrims from the entire region, and started to call the place Sint-Oda&#x27;s-Rode, which became Sint-Oedenrode in present-day speaking.

==History==
===World War II===

During the World War II Sint-Oedenrode suffered tremendously. In May 1940 the German Army invaded the Low Countries and France, and due to the retreat from the Peel-Raam Line by the Dutch Armed Forces skirmishes arose in Sint-Oedenrode in an attempt to keep the enemy at bay. After the capitulation (15 May 1940, in Zeeland 2 days later) Sint-Oedenrode found itself under German occupation. There was a small German Luftwaffe detachment of about 15 people providing a manned look-out (just like the Royal Observer Corps) for Allied planes which were undertaking operations against Volkel Air Base and Eindhoven (Air Base Welschap, now Eindhoven Airport).

During the final months of occupation, the mayor (appointed by Queen Wilhelmina) was sacked and replaced by a pro-German mayor. The reasons for the sacking were that the central Distribution Office was plundered from blank distribution cards that were necessary to get coupons for males who were hiding from the &quot;Arbeitseinsatz&quot; (compulsory labour in the German war industry) and were using fake names. Also the mayor tried to sabotage the arbeitseinsatz.
With the beginning of Operation Market Garden in September 1944, Sint-Oedenrode found itself on an important location between the Allied landing zones in Son and Veghel. General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery had the important task to keep the corridor (which ran through Sint-Oedenrode) open for the passage of the British XXX Corps to conquer Nijmegen. The US 101st Airborne Division liberated the Town of Sint-Oedenrode (the &#x27;Market&#x27; part) after para droppings in the fields in the vicinity. They were followed by the British XXX Army Corps (the &#x27;Garden&#x27; part). For a brief time the 18th-century castle Henkenshage was used as allied HQ.

The British left 150 comrades behind, the Americans 125. Twenty-two British soldiers are buried at the General Cemetery in Sint-Oedenrode. Most of the British are reburied at the Uden War Cemetery and some did find their final resting place in Mierlo. The Americans who were originally buried in Wolfswinkel (Son en Breugel) are reburied in Margraten or the US.

On 16 September 1994 101st Airborne veterans revealed a war monument &#x27;Monument for the Dutch&#x27;. The monument is a gift from the veterans to the civilians who fought alongside of the US troops, much to surprise and relief of the US soldiers. The inscription on the monument is in English and reads &quot;Dedicated to the people of the Corridor by the veterans of the 101st Airborne Division, in grateful appreciation of their courage, compassion and friendship&quot;. The monument can be found alongside the road &#x27;Corridor&#x27; which was constructed after the war between key points of the actual Corridor: the allied supply route from Eindhoven to Nijmegen.

===Post-war era===

In the twentieth century mainly the growth of &quot;N.V. ODA Steel Works&quot; and &quot;Ovenbouw v/h H.J. van de Kamp&quot;, later &quot;N.V. ODA Steel Furniture&quot; (now part of the multinational Royal Ahrend) created employment in Sint-Oedenrode. 
Sint-Oedenrode is regularly erroneously referred to as rural municipality. 
As a former market town the urbanization had already begun at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. 
The excessive urbanization is evident from the fact that in 1930 already more than half of the population was not engaged in agriculture. 
After neighboring municipalities Schijndel and Veghel, Sint-Oedenrode was at the time the third most industrialized town of eastern North-Brabant.
Around 1950 Sint-Oedenrode lost its third place to Uden, which began to develop quickly after it was designated as a core congregation. 
In 1956 only 30% of the inhabitants of Sint-Oedenrode was involved in agriculture.

==Urban development==
Sint-Oedenrode is traditionally a large town. Towns like this, which had already before 1850 more than just local significance, are referred to as &quot;vlek&quot; (market town) or &quot;vrijheerlijkheid&quot;. 
These kind of towns often show a mix of historical origin and growth factors. Usually these settlements date back to the Middle Ages and were the primary parishes with a market function, attested by the presence of a square. In St. Oedenrode this is clearly recognizable in the current market square. The oldest buildings of St. Oedenrode were concentrated around &quot;&#x27;t Sant&quot;, and the centre moved later to the current market square, where the function as a transit town led to a widening of the main road and the town&#x27;s development into a linear settlement. Fairs were held at the market square, especially for livestock and dairy products.

Early 19th century the sacristan Brock describes his birthplace Sint-Oedenrode as follows:

&quot;Dit laatsten, van ouds zoo vermaard Vlek, is thans weinig meer dan een middelmatig dorp der Meierij, bestaande uit weinig meer dan 150 afzonderlyke huizen, die een enkele straat formeert, verdeeld in den Heuvel, de Markt, het Moleneind, welke digt betimmert zyn, en den Dyk, zynde dat gedeelte naar de zyde van Eerschot tot aan de Dommel, waar de huizen meer verspreid liggen, niet aanzienlyk zyn, als in het overige gedeelte. Aan de Markt, waar het Raadhuis midden op ligt, en waar men van vooren één schoonen lindenboom, en agter eenen grooten ronden poel aantreft, zijn er de huizen op stadswijze gebouwd, en leverd een fraaij gezigt op.&quot;

&quot;This last, traditionally so renowned &quot;Vlek&quot;, is now little more than a mediocre village of the Meierij, consisting of little more than 150 separate houses, which forms a single street, divided into &quot;de Heuvel&quot;, the Market, the &quot;Moleneind&quot; which are densely housed, and &quot;de Dijk&quot;, being the part of Eerschot till the Dommel, where the houses are more scattered and are not considerable, as in the other part of town. At the Market, where the town hall is situated in the middle, and where one can find one beautiful linden tree in the front, and a large round pool in the back, there are houses build in the urban way, which looks very fine&quot;

The description indicates that despite the minimal growth in the past few centuries, Sint-Oedenrode has retained its as it were urban allure in its old centers. For the most part the town kept a very rural character, in which an alternating ribbon of workers houses, farmhouses and manors defined the towns image. This street in the old town has been quite well maintained to this date.

The center of Sint-Oedenrode been developed in recent years into a pleasant residential area. 
In total, the shopping area is almost 25.000m2. More than 40 percent of these shops ar in the center of Sint-Oedenrode. Sint-Oedenrode is mainly a shopping center for people from the own community who shop for groceries.
A relatively large proportion of the sales volume ( 64% ) consists of retail and horeca expenditure by the inhabitants of the municipality itself. 
The town is only to a limited extent able to attract customers from other parts of the country. Within the region, in particular the relationship with Son en Breugel appears to be strong. 
The inhabitants of Veghel and Boxtel are an important group of customers for the retail and horeca in Sint-Oedenrode as well. The inhabitants of Sint-Oedenrode go to regional shopping centers in Schijndel, Veghel themselves as well. 
However, especially Eindhoven has a strong attraction to Sint-Oedenrode and the entire region : 17% of spending outside the village by residents from Stint-Oedenrode is done in Eindhoven.

==Landscape development==
Sint-Oedenrode originated on the banks of the river the Dommel. The presence of this river has left a mark on the development of the landscape and the main parts of the town. The valley landscape with meadows, pastures and small landscape elements such as steep edges and pools was fairly open. The higher, cultivated fields formed with its gibbous fields, hawthorn hedges and wooden windbreaks a more closed landscape. 
In the late 13th century, the Dukes of Brabant were about to issue a perpetual lease of common grounds. For example, in 1314 the lease issued the &quot;Bodem van Elde&quot;. This vast humid forest and heathland was virtually uninhabitable. The border of this congregation, which was located between Sint Michielsgestel, Boxtel, Schijndel, Sint-Oedenrode and Liempde, was formed by the river the Dommel. The commissioning of the Bodem of Elde led to the emergence of the characteristic gibbous fields in this part of the Meierij. Some of these fields in this area existed for centuries in the same form and can nowadays be very well identified by their unchanged shape. 
On some of the parts with very loamy soils in Sint-Oedenrode there were many poplars planted from 1750 on. Between 1760 and 1780 the largest increase in silviculture took place in the municipalities Schijndel, Sint-Oedenrode, Veghel and Udenhout. Following the planting of poplars, the pattern of sand paths and wet stream valley soils were formed which characterizes the Meierijs &quot;Poplar Landscape&quot; till this day. 
This landscape was in fact purely economic, since the poplar cultivation served the clog industry. The core of this clog industry, and therefore of the poplar cultivation, was mainly formed by the municipalities Sint-Oedenrode, Schijndel, Veghel, Liempde, Best and Boxtel. In the nineteenth century Sint-Oedenrode grew again because of this industry, which reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century.
The reclamation of the remaining waste land known as the Schijndelse Heath, especially the Kienehoef, took place since the 18th century.

==Nature and Parks==
Most nature in Sint-Oedenrode is located in the Dommeldal (valley of the Dommel river). The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel and hence in Sint-Oedenrode. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area.

In addition there is the park of the Castle Henkenshage with large oak trees, designed by Leonard Springer. This park borders the area Diependaal. Originally Diependaal was a poplar planting to accommodate the wood for the clog industry, and is now being transformed into a more natural forest.

North of Sint-Oedenrode is also a heath-area. Here was formerly the Schijndel Heath. North of the Schijndelse Heath lie the Marggraff Forests. This is a deciduous forest measuring 85 ha, which lies close to the Geelders and forms together a nature reserve. South of Sint-Oedenrode lies an ancient agrarian and poplar landscape.

In the north lies park Kienehoef. With a playground, a petting zoo and two ponds.

=== List of nature areas in Sint-Oedenrode ===

* Het Groene Woud
* The Dommelbeemden
* The Moerkuilen
* The Vresselse Bossen
* De Rooise Broek and De Scheeken
* The Geelders

== Municipal council ==
The municipal council of Sint-Oedenrode consists out of 17 seats. Below is the formation of the council since 1998:

In 2014, &quot;Democratische Groepering Sint-Oedenrode&quot; and &quot;B.V.T. Rooi&quot; joined as one political party &quot;DGS-BVT Rooi&quot;.

==Notable buildings==
* Neo-Gothic &quot;&quot; (Saint Martin Church) from 1915. This is on the site of the old Oda Church. This was a Romanesque style basilica from the 11th century. It stood near the castle of Rode. In 1494 this church was expanded with a Gothic choir with a continuous light-colored horizontal strip of tuff stone, between the normal layer of bricks. It was a chapter church where nine secular canons lived. The chapter existed until 1648. In 1801 the tower collapsed, and the church was demolished to be replaced by a new building, the Saint Martin&#x27;s church, which was consecrated in 1808. In 1807 the new church was built on the foundations of the original church. In 1915 the new church was replaced by the present church, which was designed by W.Th. Aalst. It has been restored from 1995 - 1997. The choir from 1498 is still intact and is a national monument. The church is the presumed to be the tomb of Hildeware, Countess of Rode, from 1507. This was the foundress of the first church. There are some Baroque paintings and a font in the interior from the 12th century. There is also an organ of 1839, produced by Frans Smits. This was restored in 2001. 
* &quot;Martinus Cemetery&quot; from 1854. The Oda chapel is set on the famous &quot;Odabergje&quot;, in the legend the place where the Holy Oda of Brabant settled in the early Middle Ages.
* The &quot;Knoptoren&quot;. The old Eerschot church served since 1648 as a Protestant church. In 1800 the tower, dating from around 1400, lost its steeple. In the past the tombs of the Lords of the castle De Laar were located in this church.
* The &quot;Sint Paulusgasthuis&quot; (St. Paul&#x27;s Hospice) dates from 1434. The plaque, which indicates the wrong year 1546, was only applied in 1926. The characteristic white houses were inhabited until 1972 by poor single women of good character. Also the museum for Brabantic hats and poffers is located in the small house.
* &quot;Henkenshage&quot;. A former fortified farmhouse, which was known in the 14th century as Strijpe or Streepe. This was bought in 1850 by Peter Jacob Girard de Mielet van Coehoorn and was given its present form as a country stay. In fact, the building is therefore not a real castle, but a country house. During WWII it was used as a distribution centre and during the liberation of Holland (Operation Market Garden) in 1944 it was the headquarters of the US 101st Airborne Division. It is now known as Kasteel Henkenshage and is a Wedding and Function Centre.
* &quot;Castle Dommelrode&quot; is a former castle, which was built in 1605 by the sheriff of the Peelland quarter. It has long been a monastery, but today it serves as the municipal hall of Sint-Oedenrode.
* &quot;De Grote Laar&quot; is a farmstead that exist since 1360. The well belonged to the castle De Laar, which has long since disappeared.
* De Markt is a tapered, more or less square market area with a bandstand, which is partly surrounded by stately mansions, including:
** Het Oude Raadhuis (The Old Town Hall), built in 1863 as a mansion for J.G. Raup and bought in 1881 by the municipality, after the old town hall from 1691, which was at the center of the market square, was demolished. There was a balcony and a tower built, but it was abandoned in 1963 as the town council moved to Castle Dommelrode. At the back of the house is a coach house including a 14th-century cellar, from the former house &quot;Ten Kelre&quot;. In the sidewall there are a number of plaques, including those of the 2nd Regiment Hussars that was stationed in Sint-Oedenrode because of the mobilization during World War I, including a number of &quot;Horse Doctors of the 1st and 2nd class&quot;. In 1939 this regiment was again stationed in the town. There is also a memorial of the 101st Airborne Division, made in 1985.
* The Giant Clog, located in the Dommel park on the Corridor, is a reminder that Sint-Oedenrode was the centre of the clompen industry. This Clog was originally made of wood but due to vandalism has been remade in concrete.
* Coöperatieve Zuivelfabriek Sint-Oda is a building by Louis Kooken from 1916 and was a butter factory with steam engine, which has been in use till 1979. The chimney is a municipal monument.
* De Gouden Leeuw (The Golden Lion). Inn dating back to at least 1876.

==Musea==

<text>Son en Breugel () is a municipality in the southern Netherlands just outside Eindhoven. The municipality covers an area of of which is water. It had a population of in . Son en Breugel used to be two different villages: &#x27;Son&#x27; and &#x27;Breugel&#x27;, with the stream of the Dommel separating the two villages. Son en Breugel also borders the following larger municipalities: Eindhoven, Meierijstad, Nuenen, Gerwen en Nederwetten, and Best.
The spoken language is North Meierijs (an East Brabantian dialect, which is very similar to colloquial Dutch).

==History==
The villages of Son and Breugel were founded between the 12th and 14th centuries. The villages developed quickly; some 300 households (150 household for each village) occupied the two villages during the 15th century.

According to Karel van Mander&#x27;s 1604 &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot;, the painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder was born in the village of Breugel.

Both Son as well as Breugel were hit badly during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, and the number of households in the two villages shrank down to approximately 140 (which translates to approximately 600 - 800 inhabitants). However, both villages managed to recover from this setback.

During the reign of Napoleon, both villages were combined into one municipality. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the population stayed relatively stable at about 1,500 inhabitants. However, between 1910 and 1940 the population increased from 1,600 to 3,500 inhabitants when people started moving to the village for economic reasons. It was the scene of heavy fighting at the end of the Second World War, particularly during &quot;Operation Market Garden&quot;. From 1960 onwards, Son en Breugel continued to grow. As of January 1 2024, the number of inhabitants was estimated at 17,000.

==Future==
Currently, the number of households in Son en Breugel has reached 6,000. The combined village is expected to grow by about 3,000 households in the coming years, a growth of 50% (to be confirmed after a MER investigation as of March 2008), the result of which would prevent the municipality from being absorbed within the larger neighbouring municipality of Eindhoven.

Starting early 2009, a new neighbourhood will be developed within the combined village. This neighbourhood, called &#x27;Sonniuspark&#x27;, will contain 600 households and will be finished in 2013.

==Politics==
This municipality has a local council of 17 seats. After the 2022 municipal elections this had the following distribution:

<text>Steenbergen () is a municipality and a town in the province of North Brabant in the south of the Netherlands. The municipality had a population of in and covers an area of of which is water. The municipality is mainly agricultural including a strongly growing greenhouse sector, but Steenbergen and the nearby town of Dinteloord also contain some light industry. A new stretch of A4 motorway under construction is expected to further increase the municipality&#x27;s attractiveness, allowing easy connections with the large cities of Rotterdam to the north and the Belgian city of Antwerp to the south. The connection with the nearby city of Bergen op Zoom will also be improved as a result.

==Graves of Guy Gibson and Jim Warwick==
Guy Gibson, Wing Commander and the first CO of the RAF&#x27;s 617 Squadron which he led in the &quot;Dam Busters&quot; raid in 1943, crashed with his Mosquito aircraft in this municipality. Having returned to operational duties in 1944 after pestering Bomber Command, 26-year-old Gibson was killed along with his navigator, Sqn Ldr Jim Warwick, on a bombing raid on Rheydt (nowadays a borough of Mönchengladbach) operating as a Pathfinder Master Bomber based at RAF Coningsby, when his de Havilland Mosquito XX, &quot;KB267&quot;, crashed near Steenbergen on 19 September 1944. It was assumed for years that he had been shot down, but following the discovery of the wreckage it was found that a fault with the fuel tank selector possibly meant the aircraft simply ran out of fuel. An eye-witness account detailed how his aircraft circled Steenbergen and heard its engines &#x27;splutter and stop&#x27;. In 2011 it was revealed the Mosquito may also have been shot down in a friendly fire incident. The graves are in the RC cemetery of Steenbergen. Streets have been named for both Gibson and Warwick, and one of the aircraft&#x27;s propellers is located in the city park as a memorial.

<text>Uden () is a town and former municipality in the province of North Brabant, in the Netherlands. Since 2022 it has been part of the new municipality of Maashorst.

== History ==
Uden was first recorded around 1190 as &quot;Uthen&quot;. However, earlier settlements have been found in the areas of modern-day Moleneind, Vorstenburg and Bitswijk and evidence of Ice Age settlements has been found near the hamlet of Slabroek. From 1324 Uden was ruled by the Valkenburg house and became a part of the . After 1397 it became a part of the German duchy of Cleves.

Uden was hardly affected by the Eighty Years&#x27; War and gained religious freedom in 1631. A result of this was the establishment in the municipality of the Crosiers, who fled from Protestant Dutch oppression in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch in 1638. After the peace of Munster in 1648, Uden remained outside the Dutch republic and was a haven of religious tolerance, and Catholics from the nearby towns of Veghel, Nistelrode and Erp were able to build churches at the municipality&#x27;s boundaries. The period of 1648–1795 saw an increase in prosperity due to the weekly markets, however, the town was almost destroyed by a fire in 1746. The Dutch folk-hero Kobus van der Schlossen was locally active at this time.

In 1795, Uden was taken by French troops and incorporated into the Dutch republic and has been a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands since 1810. After that time Uden&#x27;s wealth diminished, mainly due to competition from the neighbouring Brabant towns, resulting in immigration to the Midwestern United States.

In 1848 The Dominican Catholic missionary Father Theodore J. van den Broek led a group of Dutch Catholics from Uden to Little Chute, Wisconsin, beginning a pattern of immigration to northeast Wisconsin that would last until the early twentieth century. That region of Wisconsin remains largely populated by descendants of Dutch Catholic immigrants from the Uden area. The Midwest was selected for its fairly similar landscape, which allowed the East Dutch immigrants, who were primarily farmers, to continue the same agricultural practices in the United States.

On 12 June 1840, a meteorite weighing approximately 720 grams fell into a field just outside Uden. It narrowly missed a group of laborers digging for peat nearby.

In 1855 the village of Volkel founded its own parish.

Uden began to specialise in the growth of cherries from 1860 onwards. In 1886, the old Petrus-church was demolished by fire and replaced by a new larger one.

During World War I (in which the Netherlands stayed neutral) North Brabant had many Belgian refugees. A refugee camp was erected at Vluchtoord in Uden, which housed several thousand Flemish refugees until 1918.

In the 1920s people started to cultivate the extensive heathlands in the eastern part of the municipality, called &quot;De Peel&quot;. In 1922 a new village was built, called Terraveen and later renamed Odiliapeel.

After Uden was struck by a devastating cyclone in 1925, it was visited by Wilhelmina, queen of the Netherlands.

Since the 1950s Uden has become a regional centre of development, providing much needed economic growth. Due to its growth, very little is left of the old town&#x27;s character.

<text>Vught () is a municipality and a town in the Province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands, and lies just south of the industrial and administrative centre of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. Many commuters live there, and in 2004 the town was named &quot;Best place to live&quot; by the Dutch magazine &quot;Elsevier&quot;.

==Population centres==

*Helvoirt
*Vught

===Topography===
&quot;Map of the municipality of Vught, 2021&quot;

==History==

===Early history===
The first mention of Vught in the historical record dates to the eleventh century. By the fourteenth century, the Teutonic Order had acquired the parish and set up a commandery across from the Saint Lambert Church. In 1328, the residents of Vught were granted the right of municipality by the Duke of Brabant.

===Eighty Years War===
During the Eighty Years War Vught was the site of struggles between Catholic interests and the troops of William of Orange. In 1629 the Saint Lambert Church became a Reformed Protestant church, after the troops of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, were victorious in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

===World War II===

Vught was the site of a transit/concentration camp (Herzogenbusch) built by Nazi Germany during its occupation of the Netherlands in World War II. It was part of Camp Herzogenbusch, but usually better known as &quot;Kamp Vught&quot;. The camp held male and female prisoners, many of them Jewish and political activists, captured in Belgium and the Netherlands. The guards included SS men and a few SS women, headed by Oberaufseherin Margarete Gallinat. The SS initially used it as a transit camp to gather mostly Jewish prisoners for classification and transportation to camps in Poland and other areas.

For supporting another female prisoner, a group of 74 women were punished by being placed in a cell barely nine square meters and held there for over fourteen hours. Ten of the women died, and several suffered permanent physical or mental damage. The camp commander responsible was demoted by Himmler to the regular rank of soldier and sent to the Hungarian front, where he died in 1945.

Dutch underground members Corrie and Betsie ten Boom were held at Vught in 1944, before being sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp. Vught was also a transition camp for many of the female laborers at the Agfa Kamerawerke in München-Giesing, where they built ignition and camera devices. Poncke Princen, who would later become known for going over to the Indonesian guerrillas opposing Dutch rule, was imprisoned at Vught for his anti-Nazi activities.

Vught was liberated by the Canadians at the end of the war, but only after German guards killed several hundred prisoners held there, mainly by firing squad.

===Camp in post-war times===
After World War II, the camp was first used as a prison for Germans and collaborators. Some of the camp has been preserved as a national monument related to the Nazi occupation during World War II.

The barracks of Camp Vught were later adapted into a number of home units to house Indonesian Moluccan exiles, former soldiers of the Netherlands armed forces and their families who were transferred to the Netherlands after Indonesian independence.

=== Department of corrections — PI Vught ===

From 1953, part of the former detention camp was developed as a juvenile prison called &quot;Nieuw Vosseveld&quot;.&#x27; Today, as &quot;PI Vught&quot;, it is a high-security prison with 15 separate units and up to 750 prisoners. Amongst those imprisoned there are:
* Samir Azzouz, terrorist with ties to Hofstad Network. Released in 2013.
* Mohammed Bouyeri, murderer of Theo van Gogh. Serving a life sentence without parole.
* Willem Holleeder, one of the perpetrators in the kidnapping of Freddy Heineken. Life imprisonment.
* , nicknamed , drug dealer. Released in 2000.
* Curtis Warren, British drug trafficker. Released in 2007.
* Ridouan Taghi, drug trafficker and murderer.

==Politics==
On 2 April 2007 Roderick van de Mortel (VVD) was appointed mayor of Vught. The aldermen appointed after the 2022 local elections were Mark du Maine (VVD), Yvonne Vos (CDA) J.H.L. den Otter (Gemeentebelangen) and N. de Lange (PvdA-GroenLinks).

==Landmarks==
Just outside the town border lies the lake &quot;IJzeren Man&quot; (literally &#x27;Iron Man&#x27;). It was named after the machine that dug it in the years 1890 to 1915 for sand used as fill for the expansion of the nearby city of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. The lake is about 2 kilometers long, has a small island and is now mainly used for recreation.

Maurick Castle dates back to the 13th century. In 1629 it was occupied by Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange as his headquarters for his siege of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch. The castle now houses a restaurant.

Vught is home to the Bredero barracks, which houses the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s CBRN defense training center.

After the village of Helvoirt and surroundings had been transferred from the former municipality of Haaren to Vught in 2021, the eastern part of the Loonse en Drunense Duinen national park became part of the municipality.

===Ewald Marggraff===
Ewald Marggraff was a well-to-do nobleman who lived in Vught. A hermit, he acquired a large amount of land and several buildings. He had frequent disputes with the local authorities, mostly over his decision to let his properties deteriorate. This enabled his land to return to natural habitat, with animal species living there that had disappeared elsewhere. On 7 December 2003 Marggraff&#x27;s manor (Zionsburg) burned down; his body was later found inside.

Marggraff&#x27;s surviving sisters founded a non-profit corporation, &quot;Marggraff stichting&quot;, to take over and manage their late brother&#x27;s extensive landholdings, providing public access to the forests, and rebuilding Zionsburg.

==Transport==
Vught has a railway station with connections to Amsterdam/Utrecht via &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Maastricht via Eindhoven, Tilburg and Nijmegen. Highway 2 / E25 and Highway 65 / N93 intersect at Vught. Also two Arriva buslines connecting Vught to the Jeroen Bosch Hospital, school district and central station, all located in neighbouring Den Bosch.

<text>Woensdrecht () is a municipality (named after the village) in the southern Netherlands.

Woensdrecht is the home of the Woensdrecht Air Base, which is located to the north-east of the village of Woensdrecht and to the north-west of Huijbergen.

== History ==

===Second World War===
On 2 October 1944, at the beginning of the Battle of the Scheldt (2 October-8 November 1944), the Canadian 2nd Division began its advance north from Antwerp. Stiff fighting at Woensdrecht ensued on 6 October, the objective of the first phase. The Germans, reinforced by Battle Group Chill, saw the priority in holding there, controlling direct access to South Beveland and Walcheren Island. There were heavy casualties as the Canadians attacked over open, flooded land. Driving rain, booby traps and land mines made the advance very difficult. On 13 October, what would come to be known as &quot;Black Friday&quot;, the Canadian 5th Infantry Brigade&#x27;s Black Watch was virtually wiped out in an unsuccessful attack. The Calgary Highlanders were to follow up with a more successful action, and their Carrier Platoon succeeded in taking the rail station at Korteven. Heavy fighting at Hoogerheide also ensued, but by 16 October, Woensdrecht was secured, cutting the land link to South Beveland and Walcheren. The Canadians were successful in completing their objective.

After that the Buffaloes, ground forces dedicating to causing as much impact to the enemy troops during the barrage, secured the Breskens pocket on the north side of the Scheldt river.

===Cold War era===
In 1983, it was decided that the United States would station 48 nuclear armed cruise missiles at the air base in the district, unless the USSR reduced their number of SS-20 missiles to 378. Since the number was still higher in 1985, stationing was to proceed. Among the Dutch population there was protest against this. The plan was cancelled in 1987 due to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

<text>Woudrichem (; Brabantian: &quot;Woerkum&quot;) is a city and former municipality in the province of North Brabant in the Netherlands.

== History ==
Woudrichem originated in the ninth century. A marketplace emerged on a riverbank where Hoogstraat and Molenstraat are now located. Around the year 1000, several settlements, mostly north of the Alm, appeared and were centered around Woudrichem. Initially, the Maas did not flow past Woudrichem. The main course of this river first flowed approximately through the bed of the current Bergsche Maas; later, the Alm was the main course, and later still, the current Afgedamde Maas, until the Bergsche Maas was dug in 1904.

Woudrichem was strategically located at the confluence of the Maas and Waal rivers, within the spheres of influence of the Duchy of Brabant, Gelre, and the County of Holland. In 1322, the Land of Altena was incorporated into the County of Holland, only to be assigned to the newly formed province of North Brabant in 1815.

In the fourteenth century, the town had grown so much that the Lord of Altena, Willem VII van Horne, granted city rights to Woudrichem in 1356. In the same year, the Count of Holland moved the comital river toll from Niemandsvriend, located in Sliedrecht, to Woudrichem. As a result, and due to other privileges such as the fishing rights granted in 1362 by Dirk Loef of Horne, the builder of Loevestein Castle, the town flourished.

During this time, the Martin church was also built. In 1386, construction of the city wall began. It was in this year that the Count of Holland annexed the Land of Altena. Negotiations between John IV of Brabant and John VI of Bavaria led to the Treaty of Woudrichem (1419). After this, the economy began to decline when the toll was moved to Gorinchem in 1420 and the Saint Elizabeth&#x27;s flood caused devastation in 1421. The situation further deteriorated, partly due to military activities.

Due to its strategic location, Woudrichem was frequently besieged. The city was attacked by the Arkels in 1405 and by the Gelders in 1511. In 1572, Woudrichem sided with William of Orange. In 1573, the Geuzen deemed the city indefensible and set it on fire.

Between 1583 and 1588, a fortification belt was built around the city, although it enclosed a smaller area than the former city wall. The fortification was designed by Adriaen Antonisz. van Alkmaar. With the help of surrounding cities, the town was rebuilt. Nevertheless, the economic situation remained poor, and in 1700, Woudrichem was granted tax exemption.

In 2006, Woudrichem celebrated &#x27;650 years of city rights.&#x27; Residents dressed in historical costumes and performed various scenes from past centuries over a weekend in August.

== Naming ==

There are several explanations for the origin of the name Woudrichem. The first and most likely explanation suggests that the place name comes from &#x27;wald&#x27; and &#x27;heim,&#x27; indicating a wooded area. A second explanation is that a Lord Waldrik built a house on the bank of the Waal. Over time, Woudrichem has been pronounced and written in various ways. Several variants have been displayed on the facade of a building on Kerkstraat in Woudrichem. Some of these variants are as follows:

* ca. 866 UUalricheshem
* ca. 1000 Walderinghem
* 1178 Waldrichem
* 1230 Woudrichemerward
* 1241 Wodrinheim / Wodrincheym / Wodrinchem
* 1465 Woldrichem
* 1476 Woerchem
* 1500 Worrynckhem / Worrynhem
* 1536 Worcum / Worcom
* 1600 Worichem
* 1724 Wornichem

In the region, people now usually say Woerkum or Woerkem.

== Geography ==

The municipality is located at in the north of North Brabant just south of the center of the Netherlands. It is part of the region of Land van Heusden en Altena.

The city of Woudrichem is the largest settlement in the municipality. It is situated on the south bank of where the rivers Waal and Afgedamde Maas join to form the Boven Merwede. The other population centres in the municipality were:

* Almkerk
* Andel
* Bronkhorst
* Duizend Morgen
* Eng
* Giessen
* Oudendijk
* Rijswijk
* Stenenheul
* Uitwijk
* Uppel
* Waardhuizen
* Zandwijk
East of the city lies Loevestein Castle, on the other side of the river in the province of Gelderland.

== Gallery ==
== Government ==
The municipal council of Woudrichem had 15 members. The mayor was Arie Noordergraaf of the Reformed Political Party. On January 1sth 2019 it joined Werkendam and Aalburg in the new municipality of Altena.

<text>Zundert () is a municipality and town in the south of the Netherlands bordering Belgium, in the province of North Brabant. 

Zundert is the birthplace of Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.

==History==

The name of Zundert is first mentioned in a certificate dating from 1157, in which the Bishop of Liege confirms a donation from the place &quot;Sunderda&quot;. This Sunderda actually relates to the current settlement of Klein-Zundert (Dutch for Small Zundert), one of the first settlements in the area. The local monks, besides their religious labour, were also involved in clearing the land, that was still rough territory, filled with swamps, peats and heath fields. The monks also assisted in improving agricultural methods.

Zundert is still surrounded by a rural environment with nature areas, one of them is the &quot;Buissche Heide&quot;, a heath area used for recreation and walking. The Kalmthoutse Heide, across the border with Belgium, is also in the vicinity.

During the Second World War Zundert, Achtmaal, Wernhout and Klein-Zundert were liberated during the allied offensive Operation Pheasant on 27 October, Rijsbergen on 28 October. Achtmaal was liberated by the 415th Infantry Regiment of the US 104th (Timberwolf) Infantry Division, Zundert and Klein-Zundert by the 413th Infantry Regiment of the 104th (Timberwolf) Infantry Division, and Wernhout and Rijsbergen by the 414th Infantry Regiment of the 104th (Timberwolf) Infantry Division.

At a small distance from the town, an old tavern called &quot;In Den Anker&quot; can be found, which has the oldest license in the Netherlands. It originally dates from 1635, but was rebuilt in 1913.

== Geography ==

The municipality of Zundert contains the following places: 
Zundert lies about above Dutch sea level (NAP), and is located south-west of the city of Breda, and north-east of Antwerp, Belgium. Zundert is surrounded by the municipalities Etten-Leur and Breda on the north, Hoogstraten (Belgium) on the east, Wuustwezel (Belgium) on the south, Kalmthout (Belgium) on the southwest, and Essen (Belgium) and Rucphen on the west.

Zundert is one of the most agricultural municipalities of the Netherlands. 10% of all nursery production of the Netherlands is around Zundert. Production of strawberries and young field grown trees and hedging plants is very important in the area.

==Architecture==

The Roman Catholic church of Zundert, dedicated to Saint Trudo, was built in 1927, and contains art treasures from the 17th century, coming from the St. Michielsabdij in Antwerp, including an original sculpture made by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens. These treasures consist of marble altar tables, three Alabaster sculptures, several paintings and two carved oaken confessionals. The church itself was designed by Jan Stuyt, a pupil of the architect Pierre Cuypers. Stuyt also designed the church of nearby Klein-Zundert in the same municipality.

The town hall of Zundert was built in 1830 in neoclassical style and demolished and rebuilt in the same style in 1965.

The Netherlands&#x27; first female architect, Margaret Staal-Kropholler, built a studio in 1919 for visual artist Richard Roland Holst and his wife, poet and politician Henriëtte Roland Holst-van der Schalk on the Buissche Heide. The studio was built in the style of the Amsterdam School.

=== Windmills ===

Zundert is the home of a 17th-century windmill, called &#x27;De Akkermolen&#x27; (The Croftmill).
It is said to have been originally built in 1652. It is a standard mill, and it was built to process grain.

The mill had numerous private owners in the past, including stadtholder Willem V, as the Baron of Breda, who became owner in 1794. In the early 1900s the mill was owned by Wilhelmus van der Stappen.

The mill was heavily damaged in 1950, and its existence was threatened several occasions after that. The Akkermolen is currently owned by the municipality of Zundert, which bought it in 1959, the last private owners being the Herijgers family. After the mill was taken over by Zundert, it needed serious restoration, which took place in 1961. Another restoration took place in 1991, but then, the entire mill needed to be taken apart and restored.

The Akkermolen can be visited, after arranging an appointment at Akkermolenweg 15.

The town had other mills in the past, one of them was a stone-mill called &quot;De Eendracht&quot;, which stood on Moleneind, currently known as Poteind. It burned down on 23 January 1909. The owner at the time, Jaak Theeuwis, had already lost a wooden mill in Zundert, which was blown down in the previous year of 1908. A store called &quot;de Boerenbond&quot; is now located on the former mills location.

== Vincent van Gogh ==

Zundert is the birthplace and childhood home of the famous painter Vincent van Gogh. He was born on 30 March 1853 in a little house on Zundert&#x27;s main street, &quot;Markt 29&quot;. The former house is gone, as it was too dilapidated to preserve, but a plaque at this location still commemorates his birth. In May 2007, the renovation of the house at Markt 29, and the neighbouring house, started. After the renovation, the Vincent van Gogh house was opened in August 2008.

People can still visit the Dutch Reformed church built in 1806 in which the father of Vincent, Theodorus van Gogh, started preaching in 1849. In the graveyard is the grave of Vincent&#x27;s one-year-older brother, who died soon in infancy and who was also called Vincent van Gogh. Vincent did not paint when he lived in Zundert, but he drew some sketches. In letters to his brother Theo, Vincent recalls Zundert and its surroundings a few times when writing about childhood, serenity, and learning about life. Because he died in the French town of Auvers-sur-Oise, on 29 July 1890, a special relation between these two places exists. This can, for example, be noticed by the existence of a slightly hidden Auvers-sur-Oise Street, ending at the Van Gogh Square.

To keep Vincent&#x27;s memory alive, the municipality of Zundert started the project of realising a Vincent van Gogh house. Rather than a classical museum, it is an active environment, with a presentation about van Gogh&#x27;s life, interactive education, a documentation room and also permanent and temporary expositions.
Tourist information is also located in the building, as well as a pleasant bar with a garden terrace.

There is a bronze monument made by the French artist Ossip Zadkine of Vincent and his brother Theo on the &quot;Vincent van Gogh Plein&quot; (Vincent van Gogh square). The statue of Vincent and Theo van Gogh was unveiled on 28 May 1964 by the former Dutch queen Juliana. The statue is an abstracted representation of Vincent&#x27;s connection with his brother Theo. There are several activities here relating to Van Gogh; you can seek tourist information here as well as participate in activities that are located in the Vincent van Gogh house opposite the town hall.

== Flower parade ==
Bloemencorso Zundert was first held in 1936, in honor of then-queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, making it the oldest hugely elaborate flower parade in Europe. Every year, the parade commences on the first Sunday of September with the floats remaining on show for the subsequent Monday (considered a holiday by the inhabitants). On Tuesday, starting early in the morning, the floats are destroyed. It is the largest flower parade in the world. The number of visitors can reach up to 50.000 people annually. Huge, impressive lorry mounted sculptures covered in thousands of dahlia flowers parade through the town. Limitations on the size and maximum dimensions of the floats were first defined in 1989, ensuring safe passage of the parade through the streets of Zundert. Considered an honour by the people of Zundert, the floats are typically pushed by volunteers. 

There are twenty hamlets competing in Bloemencorso Zundert, each of them constructing their own entry. They are entirely made up of volunteers. The twenty heralds are credited with having their own culture, identity, flag and dahlia fields in and around the municipality, used to decorate the floats for the parade. Collectively, this amounts to about 33 hectares with 600.000 dahlia plants in 50 different colours and varieties. The members of each hamlet plant and pick the flowers themselves, cultivating around 6 million dahlias in Zundert of the total of 8 million dahlias needed for the entire Corso each year. Where needed, the Bloemencorso Zundert relies on other Flower Parades and a few professional growers to fill up shortages of flowers.

On 13 October 2012, the Bloemencorso Zundert became the first Dutch tradition on the national inventory of the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of Intangible Cultural Heritage, ratified by the Netherlands on 15 May 2012. This ratification was publicly announced by State Secretary Halbe Zijlstra during the parade on 2 September 2012.

The Bloemencorso Zundert was cancelled in 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first time since the Second World War. In 2022, the flower parade commenced on 4 September.

<doc id="118765" wikidata="Q17155" url="?curid=118765" title="Barcelona Cathedral">
<text>The Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia (), also known as Barcelona Cathedral, is the seat of the Archbishop of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain. The cathedral was constructed from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, with the principal work done in the fourteenth century. The cloister, which encloses the Well of the Geese &quot;(Font de les Oques)&quot;, was completed in 1448. In the late nineteenth century, the neo-Gothic façade was constructed over the nondescript exterior that was common to Catalan churches.

Its form is a pseudo-basilica, vaulted over five aisles, the outer two divided into chapels. The transept is truncated. The east end is a chevet of nine radiating chapels connected by an ambulatory. The high altar is raised, allowing a clear view into the crypt.

The cathedral is dedicated to the Holy Cross and Eulalia of Barcelona, co-patron saint of Barcelona, a young virgin martyr who, according to Catholic tradition, suffered martyrdom during Roman times in the city. One story says that she was exposed naked in the public square and a miraculous snowfall in mid-spring covered her nudity. The enraged Romans put her into a barrel with knives stuck into it and rolled it down a street (according to tradition, the one now called &quot;Baixada de Santa Eulàlia&quot;). The relics of Saint Eulalia are entombed in the cathedral&#x27;s crypt.

The choir stalls retain the coats-of-arms of the knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece. In his first trip into Spain, Charles V, selected Barcelona as the site of a chapter of his order. The king had arrived for his investiture as Count of Barcelona, and the city, as a Mediterranean port, offered the closest communication with other far-flung Habsburg dominions, while the large proportions of the cathedral would accommodate required grand ceremonies. In 1518 the Order&#x27;s herald, Thomas Isaac, and its treasurer, Jean Micault, were commissioned to prepare the sanctuary for the first sitting of the chapter in 1519. Juan de Borgonya executed the painted decoration of the sanctuary.

The side Chapel of the Holy Sacrament and of the Holy Christ of Lepanto contains a cross said to date from the time of the Battle of Lepanto (1571).

In addition to Saints Eulalia and Olegarius, the cathedral contains the tombs of Saint Raymond of Penyafort, Count Ramon Berenguer I and his third wife Almodis de la Marche, and bishops Berenguer de Palou II, Salvador Casañas y Pagés, and Arnau de Gurb, who is buried in the Chapel of Santa Llúcia, which he had constructed.

The cathedral has a secluded Gothic cloister where 13 white geese are kept, the number explained by the assertion that Eulalia was 13 when she was martyred.

==History==
Parts of an early Christian and Visigothic episcopal complex including the baptistery (fourth century), a basilical hall (fifth century), a cross shaped church (sixth-seventh century) and bishop&#x27;s palace (sixth-seventh century) are displayed in Barcelona City History Museum archaeological underground. Reportedly, this Visigothic chapel was dedicated to Saint James, and was the proprietary church of the Viscounts of Barcelona. However, in a document from the Second Council of Barcelona in 599, it states that the cathedral was dedicated to the Holy Cross. This church was severely damaged by al-Mansur (Almanzor) during his attack on Barcelona in 985.

In 1046, Count Ramon Berenguer I and his wife Almodis, together with Bishop Guislabert, began construction of a Romanesque cathedral at the site; it was consecrated in November 1058. The cathedral was constructed over the crypt of the former church. It has been reported that a Viscount of Barcelona, Mir Geribert, sold the site to Bishop Guislebert in 1058, though however, this date does not coincide with the reported start of construction.

The present Gothic cathedral was begun on the foundations of the previous churches on 1 May 1298; James II the Just was King of Aragon at the time, and Bernat Pelegri was Bishop of Barcelona. The church was built from the east end towards the west end, with a simple west façade completed in 1417. The cloister was completed in 1448, making the total duration of construction 150 years. In the late nineteenth century, offered to complete the neo-Gothic façade and central tower as inspired by the original fifteenth-century design prepared by master Carlí and rearranged and drawn by the architect . This work was completed in 1913 by Girona&#x27;s children.

==Chapel of Lepanto==

The Chapel of the Holy Sacrament and of the Holy Christ of Lepanto is a small side chapel constructed by Arnau Bargués in 1407, as the chapterhouse. It was rebuilt in the seventeenth century to house the tomb of San Olegarius, Bishop of Barcelona, and Archbishop of Tarragona.

The &quot;Holy Christ of Lepanto&quot; crucifix, is located on the upper part of the chapel entrance&#x27;s front façade. The curved shape of the body, of Our Lord Jesus Christ on the Cross, is explained by a Catalan legend which holds that the cross was carried on the prow of the galley captained by Juan of Austria, half-brother of Spanish Philip II of Spain during the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. When a cannonball flew toward the cross, it leaned out of the way in order to avoid being hit, and has been inclined ever since. The Habsburgs were said to have regarded this as an encouraging omen.

A separate story says that the cross was in the ship&#x27;s hold and that the figure moved to cover a large hole that would have sunk the ship.

== Architecture ==
The architectural design of the Barcelona Cathedral consist of the regional style of Catalan Gothic. Catalan Gothic construction is confined to the Barcelona area and its influences. Catalan Gothic constructing consist of diaphanous areas and large spanning naves. Catalan Gothic does not seek to create towering buildings but to balance the dimensions of the structure. The Barcelona Cathedral is 93 meters (305.1 feet) long, 40 meters (131.2 feet) wide, and 28 meters (91.8 feet) high at the central nave. Each bell tower of the cathedral is 54 meters (177.1 feet) in height. The tallest point of the cathedral reaches 70 meters (229.6 feet) tall at the peak of the cimborio. The cathedral consist of three naves, one choir, and a cloister. The nave carries through the plan to the choir and the isle naves are at disproportioned heights to structurally support the central nave and the cimborio. Each aisle has two chapels in each section. The choir consist of 10 ogive (pointed) arches whereas ribbed arches were placed in the nave. Large windows are placed opening to the cloister to provide sunlight to the choir. A windowed gallery runs atop the chapels in the aisle of the nave to provide indirect light. The facade is consistent with neo-Gothic design elements. Ornament of the cathedral facade is known for sculptural gargoyles on the roof along with many other animals and mythical creatures.

=== Gothic Quarter ===
The Barcelona Cathedral is located in the cathedral neighborhood in the Gothic quarter of Barcelona. As a showing of Catalonian nationalism the mediaeval buildings of the Gothic quarter were restored from 1927 to 1970. Over 40 structures were remodeled in the gothic style to upgrade the area that became one of the most attractive part of the city. The &#x27;Catalan house&#x27; was the building that shaped the rest of the Gothic quarter. Directly behind the cathedral, many buildings during the restoration of the neighborhood were demolished or renovated to harmonizes after the Catalan House. Rebuilding the gothic quarter around the rebuilt facade of the Barcelona Cathedral and the Catalan house gave the opportunity to embellish the city with its most important buildings. The transformation of the cathedral neighborhood gives Barcelona an historic image that creates a relationship between heritage and tourism.

== Traditions ==
* The tradition of the &#x27;dancing egg&#x27; (supported by the jet of a fountain) is maintained on the day of Corpus Christi at the cathedral.

== Present day ==
The cathedral has been updated in response to an increasing number of tourists. The cloister now contains a gift shop, the traditional candles normally lit at the shrines of saints have been replaced with electronic candles, and cellular phones have been banned from the Chapel of Lepanto and other chapels.

<text>A tower block, high-rise, apartment tower, residential tower, apartment block, block of flats, or office tower is a tall building, as opposed to a low-rise building and is defined differently in terms of height depending on the jurisdiction. It is used as a residential, office building, or other functions including hotel, retail, or with multiple purposes combined. Residential high-rise buildings are also known in some varieties of English, such as British English, as tower blocks and may be referred to as MDUs, standing for multi-dwelling units. A very tall high-rise building is referred to as a skyscraper.

High-rise buildings became possible to construct with the invention of the elevator (lift) and with less expensive, more abundant building materials. The materials used for the structural system of high-rise buildings are reinforced concrete and steel. Most North American–style skyscrapers have a steel frame, while residential blocks are usually constructed of concrete. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a skyscraper, although a building with forty or more stories and taller than is generally considered a skyscraper.

High-rise structures pose particular design challenges for structural and geotechnical engineers, particularly if situated in a seismically active region or if the underlying soils have geotechnical risk factors such as high compressibility or bay mud. They also pose serious challenges to firefighters during emergencies in high-rise structures. New and old building design, building systems such as the building standpipe system, HVAC systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), fire sprinkler systems, and other things such as stairwell and elevator evacuations pose significant problems. Studies are often required to ensure that pedestrian wind comfort and wind danger concerns are addressed. In order to allow less wind exposure, to transmit more daylight to the ground and to appear more slender, many high-rises have a design with setbacks.

Apartment buildings have technical and economic advantages in areas of high population density, and have become a distinctive feature of housing accommodation in virtually all densely populated urban areas around the world. In contrast with low-rise and single-family houses, apartment blocks accommodate more inhabitants per unit of area of land and decrease the cost of municipal infrastructure.

==Definition==
Various bodies have defined &quot;high-rise&quot;:

* Emporis defines a high-rise as &quot;A multi-story structure between tall, or a building of unknown height from 12–39 floors.&quot;
* The &quot;New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines a high-rise as &quot;a building having many storeys&quot;.
* The International Conference on Fire Safety in High-Rise Buildings defined a high-rise as &quot;any structure where the height can have a serious impact on evacuation&quot;
* In the U.S., the National Fire Protection Association defines a high-rise as being higher than , or about seven stories.
* Most building engineers, inspectors, architects and similar professionals define a high-rise as a building that is at least 75 feet tall.

==History==
High-rise apartment buildings had already appeared in antiquity: the &quot;insulae&quot; in Ancient Rome and several other cities in the Roman Empire, some of which might have reached up to ten or more stories, one reportedly having 200 stairs. Because of the destruction caused by poorly built high-rise &quot;insulae&quot; collapsing, several Roman emperors, beginning with Augustus (r. 30 BC – 14 AD), set limits of for multi-story buildings, but met with limited success, as these limits were often ignored despite the likelihood of taller &quot;insulae&quot; collapsing. The lower floors were typically occupied by either shops or wealthy families, while the upper stories were rented out to the lower classes. Surviving Oxyrhynchus Papyri indicate that seven-story buildings even existed in provincial towns, such as in third century AD Hermopolis in Roman Egypt.

In Arab Egypt, the initial capital city of Fustat housed many high-rise residential buildings, some seven stories tall that could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. Al-Muqaddasi, in the 10th century, described them as resembling minarets, while Nasir Khusraw, in the early 11th century, described some of them rising up to 14 stories, with roof gardens on the top story complete with ox-drawn water wheels for irrigating them. By the 16th century, Cairo also had high-rise apartment buildings where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were rented out to tenants.

The skyline of many important medieval cities was dominated by large numbers of high-rising urban towers, which fulfilled defensive but also representative purposes. The residential Towers of Bologna numbered between 80 and 100 at a time, the largest of which still rise to 97.2 m. In Florence, a law of 1251 decreed that all urban buildings should be reduced to a height of less than 26 m, the regulation immediately put into effect. Even medium-sized towns such as San Gimignano are known to have featured 72 towers up to 51 m in height.

The Hakka people in southern China have adopted communal living structures designed to be easily defensible in the forms of Weilongwu (围龙屋) and Tulou (土楼), the latter are large, enclosed and fortified earth building, between three and five stories high and housing up to 80 families. The oldest still standing tulou dates back from the 14th century.

High-rises were built in the Yemeni city of Shibam in the 16th century. The houses of Shibam are all made out of mud bricks, but about five hundred of them are tower houses, which rise five to sixteen stories high, with each floor having one or two apartments. This technique of building was implemented to protect residents from Bedouin attacks. While Shibam has existed for around two thousand years, most of the city&#x27;s houses date from the 16th century. The city has the tallest mud buildings in the world, some more than 30 meters (100 feet) high. Shibam has been called &quot;one of the oldest and best examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction&quot; or &quot;Manhattan of the desert&quot;.

The engineer&#x27;s definition of high-rise buildings comes from the development of fire trucks in the late 19th century. Magirus had shown the first cogwheel sliding ladder in 1864. The first turntable ladder drawn by horses was developed in 1892 which had a length of 25 meters. The extension ladder was motorized by Magirus in 1904. The definition of a maximum of 22 meters for the highest floor was common in the building regulations at the time and it is still so today in Germany. The common height for turntable ladders did later go to 32 meters (100 feet), so that 30 meter is a common limit in some building regulations today, for example in Switzerland. Any building that exceeds the height of the usual turntable ladders in a city must install additional fire safety equipment, so that these high-rise buildings have a different section in the building regulations in the world.

The residential tower block with its typical concrete construction is a familiar feature of Modernist architecture. Influential examples include Le Corbusier&#x27;s &quot;housing unit&quot;, his Unité d&#x27;Habitation, repeated in various European cities starting with his Cité radieuse in Marseille (1947–52), constructed of &quot;béton brut&quot;, rough-cast concrete, as steel for framework was unavailable in post-war France. Residential tower blocks became standard in housing urban populations displaced by slum clearances and &quot;urban renewal&quot;. High-rise projects after World War II typically rejected the classical designs of the early skyscrapers, instead embracing the uniform international style; many older skyscrapers were redesigned to suit contemporary tastes or even got demolished - such as New York&#x27;s Singer Building, once the world&#x27;s tallest skyscraper. However, with the movements of Postmodernism, New Urbanism, and New Classical Architecture, that established since the 1980s, a more classical approach came back to global skyscraper design, that is popular today.

Other contemporary styles and movements in high-rise design include organic, sustainable, neo-futurist, structuralist, high-tech, deconstructivist, blob, digital, streamline, novelty, critical regionalist, vernacular, Art Deco (or &quot;Art Deco Nouveau&quot;), and neohistorist, also known as revivalist.

Currently, the tallest high-rise apartment building in the world is the Central Park Tower on Billionaires&#x27; Row in Midtown Manhattan, towering at .

===Streets in the sky===
Streets in the sky is a style of architecture that emerged in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s. Generally built to replace run-down terraced housing, the new designs included not only modern improvements such as inside toilets, but also shops and other community facilities within high-rise blocks. Examples of the buildings and developments are Trellick Tower, Balfron Tower, Broadwater Farm, Robin Hood Gardens and Keeling House in London, Hunslet Grange in Leeds and Park Hill, Sheffield, and Castlefields and Southgate Estate, Runcorn. These were an attempt to develop a new architecture, differentiated from earlier large housing estates, such as Quarry Hill flats in Leeds. Alison and Peter Smithson were the architects of Robin Hood Gardens. As another large example, in 2005 it was decided to carry out a 20-year process of demolition and replacement of dwellings with modern houses in the Aylesbury Estate in south London, built in 1970. The Hulme Crescents in Manchester were the largest social housing scheme in Europe when built in 1972 but lasted just 22 years. The Crescents had one of the worst reputations of any British social housing schemes and were marred by numerous design and practical problems.

The ideal of Streets in the Sky often did not work in practice. Unlike an actual city street, these walkways were not thoroughfares, and often came to a dead end multiple storeys above the ground. They lacked a regular flow of passers-by, and the walkways and especially the stairwells could not be seen by anyone elsewhere, so there was no deterrent to crime and disorder. There were no &quot;eyes on the street&quot; as advocated by Jane Jacobs in her book &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot;. The Unité d&#x27;Habitation in Marseille provides a more successful example of the concept, with the fifth floor walkway including a shop and café.

=== Towers in the park and microdistricts ===

Towers in the park is a morphology of modernist high-rise apartment buildings characterized by a high-rise building surrounded by a swath of landscaped land; e.g., the tower does not directly front the street.

It is based on an ideology popularised by Le Corbusier with the Plan Voisin, an expansion of the Garden city movement aimed at reducing the problem of urban congestion. It was introduced in several large cities across the world, notably in North America, Europe and Australia as a solution for housing, especially for public housing, reaching a peak of popularity in the 1960s with the introduction of prefabrication technology.

By the early 1970s, opposition to this style of towers mounted, with many, including urban planners, now referring to them as &quot;ghettos&quot;. Neighbourhoods like St. James Town were originally designed to house young &quot;swinging single&quot; middle class residents, but the apartments lacked appeal and the area quickly became much poorer. From its early days of implementation the concept was criticised for making residents feel unsafe, including large empty common areas dominated by gang culture and crime. The layout was criticised for normalising anti-social behaviour and hampering the efforts of essential services, particularly for law enforcement.

The history of microdistricts as an urban planning concept dates back to the 1920s, when the Soviet Union underwent rapid urbanization. Under the Soviet urban planning ideologies of the 1920s, residential complexes—compact territories with residential dwellings, schools, shops, entertainment facilities, and green spaces—started to prevail in urban planning practice, as they allowed for more careful and efficient planning of the rapid urban expansion. These complexes were seen as an opportunity to build a collective society, an environment suitable and necessary for the new way of life.

==Developments by region==
===Asia===

Residential tower complexes are common in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, Pakistan, Iran and South Korea, as urban densities are very high. In Singapore and urban Hong Kong, land prices are so high that a large portion of the population lives in high-rise apartments. In fact, over 60% of Hong Kong residents live in apartments, many of them condominiums. Of them in 2020, 2,112,138 were identified residents of public housing, which is 28% of the total population.

Sarah Williams Goldhagen (2012) celebrated the work of innovative architecture firms such as WOHA (based in Singapore), Mass Studies (based in Seoul), Amateur Architecture Studio (based in Hangzhou, China), and the New York City-based Steven Holl in the transformation of residential towers into &quot;vertical communities&quot; or &quot;vertical cities in the sky&quot; providing aesthetic, unusually designed silhouettes on the skyline, comfortable private spaces and attractive public spaces. None of these &quot;functional, handsome, and humane high-rise residential buildings&quot; are affordable housing.

====China====
The 2012 Pritzker Prize was awarded to Chinese architect Wang Shu. Among his winning designs is the Vertical Courtyard Apartments, six 26-story towers by his architectural firm Amateur Architecture Studio built in Hangzhou. &quot;These towers were designed to house two-story apartments, in which every inhabitant would enjoy &quot;the illusion of living on the second floor&quot;, accomplished by folding concrete floor planes (like &quot;bamboo mats,&quot; claims the firm), so that every third story opens into a private courtyard. In the larger towers, the two-story units are stacked slightly askew, adding to the visual interest of the variegated façades (Goldhagen 2012).&quot;

==== Japan ====
Housing in Japan includes various traits coming from different eras. The word &quot;danchi&quot; now either means an employer-provided housing or has a meaning similar to &quot;projects&quot;. For modern hi-rises, there are two borrowed words to make a distinction:

* &quot;&quot;Apaato&quot; (アパート）is used to describe a rather small apartment, initially made to be rented;
* a large, modern apartment would be a &quot;mansion&quot;&quot; (マンション). The &quot;mansion&quot; nickname is used for both residential towers and for individual condominium apartments (for being roomy, spacey enough to compare to detached houses).

====South Korea====
In South Korea, the tower blocks are called Apartment Complex (). The first residential towers began to be built after the Korean War. The South Korean government needed to build many apartment complexes in the cities to be able to accommodate the citizens. In the 60 years since, as the population increased considerably, tower blocks have become more common. This time, however, the new tower blocks integrated shopping malls, parking systems, and other convenient facilities.

Samsung Tower Palace in Seoul, South Korea, is the tallest apartment complex in Asia.

In Seoul, approximately 80 percent of its residents live in apartment complexes which comprise 98 percent of recent residential construction. Seoul proper is noted for its population density, eight times greater than Rome, though less than Manhattan and Paris. Its metropolitan area is the densest in the OECD.

===Europe===
====Central and Eastern Europe====


Although some Central and Eastern European countries during the interwar period, such as the Second Polish Republic, already started building housing estates that were considered to be of a high standard for their time, many of these structures perished during the Second World War.
In the Eastern Bloc, tower blocks were constructed in great numbers to produce plenty of cheap accommodation for the growing postwar populations of the USSR and its satellite states. This took place mostly in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, though in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland this process started even earlier due to the severe damages that Polish cities sustained during World War II. Throughout the former Eastern Bloc countries, tower blocks built during the Soviet years make up much of the current housing estates and most of them were built in the specific socialist realist style of architecture that was dominant in the territories east of the Iron Curtain: blocky buildings of that era are colloquially known as Khrushchyovka. However, there were also larger and more ambitious projects built in Eastern Europe at the time, which have since become recognisable examples of post-war modernism; such as the largest &quot;falowiec&quot; building in the Przymorze Wielkie district of Gdańsk, with a length of and 1,792 flats, it is the second longest housing block in Europe.

In Romania, the mass construction of standardised housing blocks began in the 1950s and 1960s with the outskirts of the cities, some of which were made up of slums. Construction continued in the 1970s and 1980s, under the systematisation programme of Nicolae Ceaușescu, which consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, in order to build blocks of flats (&quot;blocuri&quot;), as a result of increasing urbanisation following an accelerated industrialisation process. In Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia), panelák building under Marxism–Leninism resulted from two main factors: the postwar housing shortage and the ideology of the ruling party.

In Eastern European countries, opinions about these buildings vary greatly, with some deeming them as eyesores on their city&#x27;s landscape while others glorify them as relics of a bygone age and historical examples of unique architectural styles (such as socialist realism, brutalism, etc.). Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and especially in the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of the former Eastern Bloc countries have begun construction of new, more expensive and modern housing. The Śródmieście borough of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, has seen the development of an array of skyscrapers. Russia is also currently undergoing a dramatic buildout, growing a commercially shaped skyline. Moreover, the ongoing changes made to postwar housing estates since the 2000s in former communist countries vary – ranging from simply applying a new coat of paint to the previously grey exterior to thorough modernisation of entire buildings.

In the European Union, among former Warsaw Pact states, a majority of the population lives in flats in Latvia (65.1%), Estonia (63.8%), Lithuania (58.4%), the Czech Republic (52.8%), and Slovakia (50.3%) (, data from Eurostat). However, not all flat dwellers in Eastern Europe live in Cold War-era blocks of flats; many live in buildings constructed after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and some in buildings that survived World War II.

====Western Europe====
In Western Europe, there are fewer high-rise buildings because of the historic city centres. In the 1960s, developers began demolishing older buildings to replace them with modern high-rise buildings.

In Brussels there are numerous modern high-rise buildings in the Northern Quarter business district. The government of Belgium wants to recreate Washington, D.C., on a small scale.

=====France=====

There are some tall residential buildings in &quot;La Défense&quot; district, such as Tour Défense 2000, even though the district is mainly &quot;commercial&quot;. This allows the residents to walk to the nearby office buildings without using vehicles.

=====Great Britain=====

Tower blocks were first built in the United Kingdom after the Second World War, and were seen as a cheap way to replace 19th-century urban slums and war-damaged buildings. They were originally seen as desirable, but quickly fell out of favour as tower blocks attracted rising crime and social disorder, particularly after the collapse of Ronan Point in 1968.

Although Tower blocks are controversial and numerous examples have been demolished, many still remain in large cities. Due to lack of proper regulation, some tower blocks present a significant fire risk and even though there have been efforts to make them more safe, modern safety precautions can be prohibitively expensive to retrofit. The Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 was partly caused by council ignorance, as a local action group complained to the council about the fire hazards of the tower several years before the incident, yet remedial work had not been carried out. This fire further made tower blocks less desirable to British residents.

There are old high-rise buildings built in the 1960s and 1970s in areas of London such as Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney, and virtually any area in London with council housing. Some new high-rises are being built in areas such as Central London, Southwark, and Nine Elms. In east London, some old high-rises are being gentrified, in addition to new high-rises being built in areas such as Stratford and Canary Wharf.

=====Ireland=====
; Republic of Ireland

The majority of residential high-rise buildings in the Republic of Ireland were concentrated in the suburb of Ballymun, Dublin. The Ballymun Flats were built between 1966 and 1969: seven 15-story towers, nineteen 8-story blocks and ten 4-story blocks. These were the &quot;seven towers&quot; referred to in the U2 song &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;. They have since been demolished. 

Inner Dublin flat complexes, typically of four to five storeys include Sheriff Street (demolished), Fatima Mansions (demolished and redeveloped), St Joseph&#x27;s Gardens (demolished; replaced by Killarney Court flat complex), St Teresa&#x27;s Gardens, Dolphin House, Liberty House, St Michael&#x27;s Estate (eight storeys) and O&#x27;Devaney Gardens and a lot more mainly throughout the north and south inner city of Dublin. Suburban flat complexes were built exclusively on the northside of the city in Ballymun, Coolock and Kilbarrack. These flats were badly affected by a heroin epidemic that hit working-class areas of Dublin in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Residential tower blocks were previously uncommon outside of Dublin, but during the era of the Celtic Tiger the largest cities such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway witnessed new large apartment building, although their heights have generally been restricted. Some large towns such as Navan, Drogheda, Dundalk and Mullingar have also witnessed the construction of many modern apartment blocks.

; Northern Ireland

Tower blocks in Northern Ireland were never built to the frequency as in cities on the island of Great Britain, but taller high-rises are generally more common than in the Republic of Ireland. Most tower blocks and flat complexes are found in Belfast, although many of these have been demolished since the 1990s and replaced with traditional public housing units. The mid-rise Divis flats complex in west Belfast was built between 1968 and 1972. It was demolished in the early 1990s after the residents demanded new houses due to mounting problems with their flats. Divis Tower, built separately in 1966, still stands, however; and in 2007 work began to convert the former British Army base at the top two floors into new dwellings. Divis Tower was for several decades Ireland&#x27;s tallest residential building, having since being surpassed by the privately owned Obel Tower in the city centre. In the north of the city, the iconic seven-tower complex in the New Lodge remains, although so too the problems that residents face, such as poor piping and limited sanitation. Farther north, the four tower blocks in Rathcoole dominate the local skyline, while in south Belfast, the tower blocks in Seymour Hill, Belvoir and Finaghy remain standing.

Most of the aforementioned high-rise flats in the city were built by the Northern Ireland Housing Trust (NIHT) as part of overspill housing schemes, the first such development being the pair of point blocks in East Belfast&#x27;s Cregagh estate. These eleven-story towers were completed in 1961 and were the first tall council housing blocks on the island of Ireland. The NIHT also designed the inner city Divis Flats complex. The six-to-eight-storey deck-access flats that comprised most of the Divis estate were of poor build quality and were all demolished by the early 1990s. Similar slab blocks were built by the NIHT in East Belfast (Tullycarnet) and Derry&#x27;s Bogside area, all four of which have been demolished.

Belfast Corporation constructed seven tower blocks on the former Victoria Barracks site in the New Lodge district. While the Corporation built some mid-rise flats as part of slum clearance schemes (most notably the now demolished Unity Flats and the Weetabix Flats in the Shankill area), New Lodge was its only high-rise project in the inner city; there were three more in outlying areas of the city during the 1960s, two being in Mount Vernon in North Belfast and one being in the Clarawood estate, East Belfast. The Royal Hospital built three thirteen-story towers for use as staff accommodation, prominently located adjacent to the M2 Motorway at Broadway. Belfast City Hospital also constructed a high-rise slab block which since privatisation has been named Bradbury Court, formerly known as Erskine House. Queens University Belfast built several eleven storey towers at its Queens Elms student accommodation. Of the three sixteen-story point blocks of Larne Borough Council in the late 1960s, only one remains.

====Canada====
In Canada, large multi-family buildings are usually known as &quot;apartment buildings&quot; or &quot;apartment blocks&quot; if they are rented from one common landowner, or &quot;condominiums&quot; or &quot;condo towers&quot; if each dwelling unit is individually owned; they may be called &quot;low-rise&quot; (or &quot;walk-up&quot;), &quot;mid-rise&quot;, &quot;high-rise&quot;, or &quot;skyscraper&quot; depending on their height. Tall residential towers are a staple building type in all large cities. Their relative prominence in Canadian cities varies substantially, however. In general, more populated cities have more high-rises than smaller cities, due to a relative scarcity of land and a greater demand for housing.

However, some cities such as Quebec City and Halifax have fewer high-rise buildings due to several factors: a focus on historic preservation, height restrictions, and lower growth rates. In middle-sized cities with a relatively low population density, such as Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, or Hamilton there are more apartment towers but they are greatly outnumbered by single-family houses. Most of the largest residential towers in Canada are found in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver; the country&#x27;s most densely populated cities.

Toronto contains the second largest concentration of high-rise apartment buildings in North America (after New York). In Canada, like in other New World countries, but unlike Western Europe, most high-rise towers are located in the city centre (or &quot;downtown&quot;), where smaller, older buildings were demolished to make way in redevelopment schemes.

====United States====


In the United States, tower blocks are commonly referred to as &quot;midrise&quot; or &quot;highrise apartment buildings&quot;, depending on their height, while buildings that house fewer flats (apartments), or are not as tall as the tower blocks, are called &quot;lowrise apartment buildings&quot;. Specifically, &quot;midrise&quot; buildings are as tall as the streets are wide, allowing five hours of sunlight on the street.

Some of the first residential towers were the Castle Village towers in Manhattan, New York City, completed in 1939. Their cross-shaped design was copied in towers in Parkchester and Stuyvesant Town residential developments.

The government&#x27;s experiments in the 1960s and 1970s to use high-rise apartments as a means of providing the housing solution for the poor broadly resulted in failure. Made in the tower in the park style, all but a few high-rise housing projects in the nation&#x27;s largest cities, such as Cabrini–Green and Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago, Penn South in Manhattan, and the Desire Projects in New Orleans, fell victim to the &quot;ghettofication&quot; and are now being torn down, renovated, or replaced. Another example is the former Pruitt–Igoe complex in St. Louis, torn down in the 1970s.

In contrast to their public housing counterparts, commercially developed high-rise apartment buildings continue to flourish in cities around the country largely due to high land prices and the housing boom of the 2000s. The Upper East Side in New York City, featuring high-rise apartments, is the wealthiest urban neighborhood in the United States.

Currently, the tallest residential building in the world is Central Park Tower located in Midtown Manhattan, having a height of with the highest occupied floor at .

===Oceania===

High-rise living in Australia was limited to the Sydney CBD until the 1960s, when a short-lived fashion saw public housing tenants located in new high-rise developments, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. The buildings pictured along with four other 16-story blocks were constructed on behalf of the Royal Australian Navy and were available to sailors and their families for accommodation. Due to social problems within these blocks the Navy left and the Department of Housing took charge and flats were let to low income and immigrant families. During the 1980s many people escaping communism in Eastern bloc countries were housed in these buildings. Developers have enthusiastically adopted the term &quot;apartment&quot; for these new high-rise blocks, perhaps to avoid the stigma still attached to housing commission flats.

== Deck access ==
Deck access is a type of flat that is accessed from a walkway that is open to the elements, as opposed to flats that are accessed from fully enclosed internal corridors. Deck-access blocks of flats are usually fairly low-rise structures. The decks can vary from simple walkways, which may be covered or uncovered, to decks wide enough for small vehicles. The best-known example of deck-access flats in the UK is Park Hill, Sheffield, where the decks are wide enough to allow electric vehicles; however, the design is inspired by French Modernist architect Le Corbusier, particularly his Unité d&#x27;habitation in Marseille.

== Green tower blocks ==
Green tower blocks have some scheme of living plants or green roofs or solar panels on their roofs or incorporate other environmentally friendly design features.

<doc id="118770" wikidata="Q929081" url="?curid=118770" title="Book of Mormon (Mormon's record)">
<text>The Book of Mormon is a book, or subdivision, of the larger Book of Mormon. This &quot;inner&quot; book has nine chapters. According to the text, the first seven chapters were abridged by the prophet Mormon and the last two by his son Moroni.

The book thus explains the claimed provenance of the Book of Mormon as an ancient record, mostly of the Nephites, compiled by Mormon and Moroni on golden plates.

== Synopsis ==
===Early life===
Ammaron comes to Mormon when he is ten years old, because Ammaron judges him to be a serious child who was very intelligent. He tells Mormon that when he will be 24 years old, he must to go to the land of Antum and to the hill Shim, where he can find all the plates which Ammaron buried. He is supposed to take only the plates of Nephi but leave the other plates in the ground. Then he is to keep a journal of the doings of his people on the plates of Nephi.

When Mormon is 11, his father Mormon takes him south to the land of Zarahemla. Mormon finds that land to be completely covered with buildings and people. He witnesses a war between the Nephites and Lamanites along the borders of Zarahemla. The Lamanites are beaten by a force of 30,000 Nephites, then they withdraw and there is peace for four years.

There is so much wickedness among the Nephites that Jesus Christ orders a recall of his three glorified disciples, and their work of miraculous healing comes to an end. But Mormon himself receives the Holy Spirit because of the soberness of his mind. He wants to become a preacher, but his mouth is stopped shut by God due to the wilful rebellion of the Nephites.

There are robbers among the Lamanites who roam the land, causing the Nephites to bury their worldly goods in the earth, but the land is cursed, and it will not securely hold their valuables.

===Leader of the armies===

When war comes again between the Nephites and Lamanites in AD 327, Mormon is appointed the leader of their armies because he is large in stature, despite being only 16 years old. But the Lamanite armies are so great that Mormon&#x27;s armies will not fight, and they began a retreat toward the north.

There they take possession of the city of Angola and fortify it to defend against the Lamanites. But it is still not enough, and they are driven by their enemies out of the city and out of the land of David. Then Mormon&#x27;s army comes to the land of Joshua and try to make a stand, with the western sea hard by. The Lamanite king Aaron comes against Mormon&#x27;s 42,000 with 44,000 of his own men, and is defeated in battle. This occurs in AD 331.

Finally it dawns on the Nephites that they cannot keep their own property on account of the robbers and the cursed land, and there arises a great lamentation. Mormon hopes that they will now turn back to the Lord and receive his blessings again, but his hope is in vain, because they are not sorrowful for their sins, but sorrowful for their lost property.

The Nephites are pursued by the Lamanites to the land of Jashon before Mormon can get them to stop and make another stand. The city of Jashon, by coincidence, is near the place where Ammaron told Mormon to dig up the plates of Nephi, which Mormon promptly did. Fourteen years prior, Ammaron told Mormon to dig up only the plates of Nephi and update them with the current doings of the Nephites. But Mormon has seen nothing but wickedness and abominations around him all his life, so he makes an account of them on the plates of Nephi and they end up in the hill of Cumorah. But only a brief summary of their wickedness is recorded on the plates that Joseph Smith translated.

Mormon records that besides much theft there was murder and divine cursing in the land. The Nephites boast in their strength and make oaths. They fight without asking God for help. Mormon says they were doing abominations too, but we have no record of what that entailed.

The Nephites are again hunted until they come northward to the land of Shem and fortify the city there. Mormon inspires the people at last stand to boldly and fight for their wives and children and hearth and home. It seems to work, for they did not shrink back when the Lamanites attack Shem. Mormon&#x27;s army of thirty thousand defeats a Lamanite army of fifty thousand. They chase after the Lamanites, beat them again, reclaim their homelands, get them divided, and cease fighting for ten years. (Mormon ch. 2.)

During those ten years, the Lord commands Mormon to preach repentance to his people. It&#x27;s useless, however, and they remain wicked. At the end of the ten years (AD 360), the Lamanites attack again, and the Nephites defeat them—twice. The Nephites become arrogant with these victories and decide they will avenge their fallen people and destroy their enemies. As a result of this, Mormon washes his hands of the mantle of the Nephite armies, and distances himself from them, especially after the Lord tells him that if the Nephites do not repent, it is they who will be destroyed instead.

Mormon, when writing about this, adds that future generations are not immune from this same judgment. (Mormon ch. 3.)

===Idle witness===
In the year 363, the Nephites, without Mormon at their head, leave the land Desolation to attack the Lamanites. The Lamanites drive them back to Desolation, fight and defeat the Nephites again, and the Nephites retreat from Desolation to Teancum. Mormon explains to future readers that the Nephites would not have been defeated if they had not attacked the Lamanites.

The following year, it is the Lamanites that attack the Nephites and are defeated, causing the Nephites to boast again. War continues until the year 367, when the Nephites, in their anger at the Lamanites&#x27; act of sacrificing women and children prisoners, fight back and drive the Lamanites out, so that they don&#x27;t fight the Nephites again until 375. But when that happens, the Lamanites use all their strength, so that the Nephites never win again–prompting Mormon to go to the hill Shim and secure the records. (Mormon ch. 4.)

<text>The City of Lathrup Village ( ) is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Lathrup Village lies roughly north of downtown Detroit, and is completely surrounded by the larger city of Southfield. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 4,088.

==History==

The city of Lathrup Village is an outgrowth of the development known as Lathrup Townsite, the dream of its developer Louise Lathrup Kelley. In 1923 she purchased a tract of in Southfield Township, in southern Oakland County, and proceeded to plant a residential neighborhood that encompasses the city of . Lathrup Townsite was conceived as a controlled community with rigorous standards, including houses built only of masonry construction; early integration of attached garages; as well as established minimums for construction cost to ensure quality. The community also had housing covenants to prevent the sale of homes to African American families, part of a larger trend in the mid-20th century of racist white Detroiters fleeing to the suburbs to avoid living near black residents (see white flight). As the community developed, Mrs. Kelley implemented numerous innovative directives, including operating a shuttle service to local shopping areas, and allowing the financing of automobiles as part of the financing of houses, which created a stronger connection between the relatively isolated townsite and more established suburbs, as well as the city of Detroit. Mr. Charles Kelley, who had been a real estate writer for the &quot;Detroit News&quot;, assisted his wife in bringing talented architects to the community to design many of the custom homes that are features of the community.
The City of Lathrup Village was incorporated in 1953 as the first incorporated community in Southfield Township. The residents thwarted an attempt by township residents to include Lathrup Townsite in their planned incorporation of the city of Southfield, resulting in Southfield&#x27;s incorporation being delayed until 1958. Louise Lathrup Kelley played an active role in the new city until her death in 1963, after which her remaining real estate holdings in the city were sold and developed.

===Lathrup Village Historic District===
In 1998 much of Lathrup Village was included on the National Register of Historic Places as the Lathrup Village Historic District. The district includes approximately 1,200 properties, primarily residential, that reflect characteristic housing styles from the first half of the 20th century. These include Colonial Revival, Tudor and ranch houses. According to the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office: “The district possesses a strong geometric street pattern integrated with curvilinear patterns that provide a rural character. This layering of patterns produces octagonal, circular and semi-circular focal points and a series of small triangular parks scattered throughout the district. It also creates unique and changing perspectives, as views of significant buildings suddenly appear at surprising moments. Likewise, at the uniquely configured intersections of many streets, one is met with a new perspective as suddenly several sections of the district become visible.” The developer of the district was Louise Lathrup Kelley. According to the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office “As a woman acting as developer starting in the 1920s, she was essentially alone, however her dogged persistence and insistence on quality resulted in a unique community that was the summation of her career.”

===Annie Lathrup School===
Lathrup Village was formerly served by the Annie Lathrup School, an elementary school located on Southfield Rd. in the center of the city. The school was built in 1926 and opened in 1927, opposite the Town Hall Sales Office, in an effort to give Lathrup Village a focal point. The building originally had four classrooms, a kindergarten, and a gymnasium. Additional classrooms were built in the 1950s. It was incorporated into the Southfield Public School system, and eventually closed in the late 1970s.

The school building is Lathrup Village&#x27;s only historical landmark. According to the city&#x27;s Economic Development Strategy, &quot;With the demolition of the town hall in the 1990s, the school remains the only historic structure on Southfield Road.&quot; The Lathrup Village Redevelopment Report relates that &quot;The Annie Lathrup School was included in the Lathrup Village Local Historic District when it was established in 1999&quot; and &quot;is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&quot; All existing efforts to redevelop the city center of Lathrup Village must contend with the difficult question of how to treat this building, and as such none of the many redevelopment plans have been accepted.

The school was named for Annie Lathrup (1861–1954), mother of developer Louise Lathrup Kelley. The school mascot was a beaver, and the sports teams were known as the Lathrup Beavers. Muriel Stacey established the library at the school.

Mark Howe, Marty Howe, and the rest of Gordie Howe&#x27;s children attended the school.

After the school was closed, the building was purchased by Yeshivat Akiva, which was based there until 1999. In the late 1990s the building was sold to a real estate developer, who hoped to use the land for a shopping center. The residents of Lathrup Village protested against this plan and instead another academic organization, the Academy of America, rented the building and opened a branch called The Academy of Lathrup Village. As of December 2013 the building was up for lease.

<text>Novi ( ) is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northwestern suburb of Detroit, Novi is located roughly northwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 66,243, an increase of 20% from the 2010 census.

==History==

Novi was organized as a township in 1832, on land taken from Farmington Township. The name Novi was offered by resident Dr. J. C. Emery, at the suggestion of his wife. Residents were reportedly looking for a shorter name than Farmington.

A local account has said that it was named after the sixth toll gate (No. VI) on the Grand River Road. However, the township was named in 1832 and the toll road was not constructed until the 1850s. Another account said that it was the sixth stagecoach stop outside Detroit. Similarly, the township was said to be stop six (or VI) on the railroad, but the Holly, Wayne &amp; Monroe Railway (now CSX Transportation) was not constructed through the township until 1870–71, almost 40 years after the organization and naming of the township.

Novi was incorporated as a city in 1969 after the approval of a city charter on February 18, 1969, by Village of Novi voters. Charter approval followed an election on May 20, 1968, in which voters approved the incorporation of the city: the vote was 694 in favor and 283 votes against. The charter became effective on February 24, 1969. There had been several previous attempts by organizers to incorporate as a city. The city was incorporated along the boundaries of the existing Village of Novi, and grew quickly in the latter half of the 20th century as second- and third-stage waves of white flight from the City of Detroit and older suburbs resulted in more extensive urban sprawl in the region.

===Historic sites===
*The historic Township Hall was originally located on Novi Road, south of Grand River. It was moved to the Novi Library property in the 1980s. It was recently relocated again onto the property that was the site of the Jacob and Rebecca Fuerst Farmstead.
*Tollgate Farm is a 160-acre (650,000m2) farmstead and educational center.
*The Colonel Samuel White Homestead site is identified by a Michigan Historical Marker.
*A portion of the original Novi Depot was constructed in 1871 for the Holly, Wayne and Monroe Railroad (now absorbed by CSX Transportation).
*The Jacob and Rebecca Fuerst Farmstead was a historic site listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The City of Novi demolished the Fuerst Farmstead in order to develop the site for other historic uses. The north barn was destroyed on July 16, 2008. The farm house was demolished in August 2008. The south and east barns were dismantled and removed from the site. None of the original buildings of the Farmstead was preserved on the site. But the historic Township Hall was relocated to this site.

The enhancements speed the process, allowing businesses to move ahead with plans for relocation or expansion. Novi has been able to attract several smaller, innovative international firms that have been able to incubate and expand into a larger facility, such as Howa USA Holdings, a Japanese auto supplier with a new research and development center in Novi specializing in interior components for vehicles.

<text>Novi Township is a civil township of Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. At the 2020 census, the township had a population of 160. Of the original survey township, only a small portion of remains unincorporated from the surrounding city of Novi. Novi Township is the smallest township in the state by total land area and the third-smallest municipality after the villages of Ahmeek and Copper City.

The township consists solely of the Brookland Farms #1 subdivision and is served by the Northville 48167 ZIP Code. Students within Novi Township attend Northville Public Schools.

== History ==
Novi Township was organized in 1832 from Farmington Township. The name was offered by resident Dr. J.C. Emery, at the suggestion of his wife. Residents were reportedly looking for a shorter name than Farmington. Several popular but historically inaccurate explanations have been suggested for the origin of the name Novi. One version is that it was named after the 6th tollgate on the Grand River toll road (No. VI). However, the township was named in 1832 and the toll road wasn&#x27;t constructed until the 1850s. A similar claim is made about the township being stop number 6 on the railroad. However, the railroad was not constructed through the township until 1870 - 1871, almost 40 years after it was named.

== Annexation and incorporation ==
Only a small portion of the original Township of Novi remains unincorporated. The majority of the township incorporated first as the Village of Novi in 1958 and later into the City of Novi in 1969. Before the incorporation of the Village of Novi, the northwest portion of the township was incorporated as part of the Village of Wixom, which later incorporated as the City of Wixom. Portions of the township were annexed into the Village of Northville in the early 1900s (the Oakwood Subdivision north of Baseline Road) and the City of Northville in the 1950s. In the 1970s, several areas of the township which had been detached from the Village of Novi were annexed into the City of Novi following a long legal battle between the city and township. These areas include the Hometown Novi Mobile Home Park and land that now includes portions of Chase Farm subdivision, Maples of Novi, and Island Lake of Novi. Some of the legal disputes over the annexations were not resolved until 1984.

== Political ==
The remaining area of the township is a legally separate entity from the surrounding City of Novi and has all the powers granted under Michigan state law to general law townships. The township has no township hall and township board meetings and township elections are held at the homes of the township board members. Most of the township services are provided through contracts with the City of Novi including fire protection and library services. The historic township hall was once located on the west side of Novi Road, south of Grand River Avenue. Moved to the civic center campus in the late 1980s, the building was restored by volunteers. The historic township hall is currently located on Ten Mile Road in the City of Novi, just west of the Novi Public Library and adjacent to the site of the former historic Fuerst Farmstead. The historic township hall is owned by the City of Novi. , the Township Supervisor is John Juntunen (elected 2004).

== Geography and land use ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all land. The township has a gently rolling topography. Most of the township is covered by light to heavy woodland cover and has been developed for single-family homes. The remaining land consists of road right-of-way and a few undeveloped platted lots.

<text>Oak Park is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Oak Park borders Detroit to the north, roughly northwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 29,560.

==History==
This area was designated as within Royal Oak Township; it was first settled by European Americans in 1840, but remained sparsely populated for many decades following. The first major housing development was constructed in 1914 at the time of World War I, when the township sold land to the Majestic Land Company to be developed as the Oak Park subdivision. The subdivision was incorporated as a village on May 3, 1927. Two petition drives during the Great Depression to dissolve the village government and return it to the township, citing &quot;excessively high cost of village government,&quot; failed in 1931 and 1933. The village incorporated as a city on October 29, 1945, following the end of World War II.

Stimulated by the GI Bill which aided veterans in buying new housing, highways to improve commuting, and planned developments in the late 1950s, Oak Park from 1950 to 1960 was named as &quot;America&#x27;s Fastest Growing City&quot;. Its population increased sevenfold, from 5,000 to more than 36,000. Much of its population was second- and third-generation children of European immigrants who had settled in Detroit in the early 20th century. These included many Jewish Americans, many of whom are of the Orthodox faith. Major civic improvements in this period included construction of an outdoor swimming pool and an ice rink in Major Park (now known as Shepherd Park, after former mayor David Shepherd, but long known informally as Oak Park Park).

In 1995, Detroit-based window manufacturer WeatherGard moved its headquarters to Oak Park.

In 2002 and 2004, the city annexed portions of neighboring Royal Oak Township to expand its land and tax base.

On November 8, 2011, the citizens of Oak Park elected a new mayor, Marian McClellan. She was the city&#x27;s first new mayor in 22 years, replacing the long-serving Jerry Naftaly.

In April 2015, the city approved the development of a new FedEx distribution center which will be located on a 60-acre plot of land at the site of the former Detroit Artillery Armory. The facility opened on March 31, 2017.

On May 5, 2015, the citizens of Oak Park voted to allow mixed drinks to be sold at businesses within city limits, in addition to beer and wine, which were previously allowed.

On November 3, 2015, the citizens of Oak Park re-elected McClellan, who was running against Aaron Tobin.

==Education==
Oak Park&#x27;s educational history began with the Clinton School, a one-room schoolhouse on property donated by Barney Clinton in the early 20th century. As the population grew rapidly, Clinton School was expanded and more elementary schools were built, particularly beginning in the 1950s.

Clinton School was made a junior high school and another was built in the mid-1960s, then named for the poet Robert Frost. At that time, one school in Oak Park had a special education department for children with learning disabilities: Lessenger Elementary School on Albany St. at Sunset St. Consequently, many families with such special children gravitated to the neighborhood surrounding Lessenger, creating a &quot;cluster&quot; of such families rarely found elsewhere.

Educational achievement was the long consistent pattern in Oak Park. Over 85% of Oak Park High School graduates continued their education immediately after high school, whether in college, or in trade or vocational schools. In the 1950s and 1960s the school system was renowned statewide due to the efforts of progressive and dedicated teachers and community support which liberally allocated tax dollars to fund education through voter approved bond issues.

The high school had an average score of 3.8 on the state&#x27;s MEAP test in 2011. This was one of the lowest scores in Oakland County.

Students residing between 10 Mile Rd. and 11 Mile Rd. are in the Berkley School District. A square mile on the east end of Oak Park is in the neighboring Ferndale School District; the majority of the city is in Oak Park Schools.

==Controversy==
In July 2011, Oak Park gained national attention when the city charged Julie Bass, a homeowner, for growing vegetables in her front yard.

In March 2015, Stephanie Sumner and Michael Sumner were fired from their positions as city employees after the city had discovered that they had stolen $433,000 from the city over the course of two years. Several months after the story broke, the city announced that the stolen funds had been replaced through the city&#x27;s insurance policy. However, many residents voiced their concerns regarding the potential insurance rate hikes that would occur after insurance claims to replace the stolen money.

<text>The Charter Township of Oakland is a charter township on the north Oakland County outskirts of Metro Detroit, in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is colloquially referred to as &quot;Oakland Township&quot;. The population was 20,067 at the 2020 census.

Oakland Township is less densely populated than neighboring townships to the west, south, and east; and retains many elements of a rural, wooded residential bedroom community. Local ordinances and zoning laws are aimed at limiting commercial and industrial development while maintaining a cap on population density by way of a master plan.

Oakland Township&#x27;s northern half has its own zip code, &quot;Oakland, Michigan, 48363&quot;, while the southern portion of the township shares zip code 48306 with the northernmost portion of adjacent Rochester Hills. &quot;Oakland&quot;, &quot;Goodison&quot;, “Rochester”, and &quot;Rochester Hills&quot; are other city names recognized for addresses for residents in this township.

==Communities==
The Township has unincorporated communities:
*Campbells Corner is on the northern border with Addison Township at .
*Goodison (also historically known as Goodison Station) is located within the township at Collins, Territorial/Orion and Gallagher/Tower Roads ( Elevation: 840 ft./256 m.). Goodison is named for William Goodison and his family who ran the local grist mill after immigrating from England. The mill was established in 1835, and a post office began operations in 1874. Goodison was a named station on the Michigan Central Railroad on a north–south track between Bay City and Detroit. One of the Oakland Township Master Plan objectives is to &quot;Establish Goodison as a central gathering place&quot;. To this end township officials are attempting to restore water to the water wheel at the current old mill site and draw small retail businesses to the area.
Former Communities:
*Oakland (also known as Kline Settlement and Alert) is located within the township at Stoney Creek and Rochester Roads. This was the original settlement in the township. In its prime it had two churches and a school house. It contained the first post office in the township as well. It is now a Ghost town with only a graveyard left in the area where the town once stood. The town was established in 1822 when the post office was built. In 1894 the town changed names from Oakland to Alert and in 1902 the Alert post office closed its doors. The Paint Creek Methodist Church was moved from this town to Goodison sometime in the 1870s. This is the last remaining building of the town. With the construction on the Michigan Central Railway which established Goodison Station, the town of Oakland was bypassed and this led to its ultimate fate.

==History==
Oakland Township has the distinction of being one of the Michigan&#x27;s oldest townships, and was first named in surveys using the guidelines set by the Land Ordinance of 1785. A United States General Land Office opened in 1818, bringing the first permanent settlers to the area. It was one of the original 25 townships in the Territory of Michigan when counties were further divided into townships in 1827. Township boundaries and area (36 sq mi) were finalized in 1837 when Michigan gained statehood.

A grist mill and mill race was built on Paint Creek in 1835. Later named Goodison Mill, it operated for more than 100 years before being dismantled in the late 1940s. The former site of the mill is the current location of Paint Creek Cider Mill.

Goodison Station was a flag station built in 1872 on the Detroit and Bay City Railroad. Another branch of track served the Detroit United Railway. In 1926, a head-on collision between a passenger train and freight train near the Goodison depot resulted in one death and 36 injuries. Passenger service on the lines had ceased by 1950.

Paint Creek Trail opened in 1983 as the first rail trail in Michigan. The trail is in the right-of-way of the former Detroit and Bay City Railroad, Michigan Central Railroad and Penn Central Railroad lines; linking the village of Lake Orion with the city of Rochester and passing through the unincorporated village of Goodison. The original rail line was in service until the track was removed when Penn Central&#x27;s railroad operations were taken over by Conrail in 1976 The property was purchased by the trail commission representing local governments in 1983 for $450,000.

Oakland Township is one possible location of the final resting place of former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, who has been missing since 1975. A specific piece of property came under scrutiny in January 2013 after Tony Zerilli, 85, the son of reputed former Detroit Partnership boss Joseph Zerilli, told investigators that Hoffa was buried there. It was reported that the property had at one time been owned via land contract and intermediate businesses by Jack Tocco, a convicted mobster who also had legitimate real estate holdings in Metro Detroit, including Oakland Township. On June 17, 2013, FBI investigators arrived to conduct a thorough search of the area. On June 19, 2013, authorities concluded the search after no evidence was discovered.

The township is primarily governed by:
* Board of Trustees (7 elected members)
* Park Commission (7 elected members)
* Planning Commission (7 appointed members)
* Zoning Board of Appeals (5 appointed members)
* Historical District Commission (7 appointed members)

The board of trustees is responsible for the hire of a Township Manager (similar to a city manager) who manages the day-to-day operations of the local government. Dale Stuart is the township manager. All of these groups have regular meetings that are open to the public and documented with written minutes and videotape available at the township website.

Police protection for the township is provided through a contract with the Oakland County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, who also provides emergency dispatch services.

Fire protection and emergency medical services is provided by the Oakland Township Fire Department - a &quot;combination&quot; fire department primarily staffed by paid-on-call personnel and one full-time firefighter/paramedic at each fire station. The Oakland Township Fire Department is an advanced life support transporting agency that responds to approximately 900 calls/year, with a majority being medical emergencies.

==Schools==
Rochester Community Schools serves a majority of the township following a school district consolidation in 1952. Lake Orion Community Schools and Romeo Community Schools serve the remaining areas of the township. Previously, schools within township borders were autonomous. Baldwin School is a former one room schoolhouse in the Goodison area that now serves local students as Baldwin Elementary, a Rochester Community Schools K-5 elementary school.
