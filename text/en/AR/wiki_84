<text>Williamstown is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in Monroe Township in Gloucester County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2010 U.S. census, Williamstown&#x27;s population was 15,567.

==History==
Before the community&#x27;s settlement in 1737, Williamstown was inhabited by the Lenni-Lenape tribe of Native Americans, from whom the town derived its original name, &quot;Squankum&quot;, for &quot;place where evil spirits dwell&quot;. The name was changed to Williamstown when the town&#x27;s first post office was established in 1842, due to postal regulations that prohibited two towns from having the same name and there was an older Squankum located northeast. It is generally thought that &#x27;evil spirits&#x27; referred to the abundance of mosquitoes in the area, a by-product of the low-lying swamps that characterized the area during that time period. In the early eighteenth century, Richard Penn sold what eventually became Williamstown to his grandson, John Williams, who divided and resold the land in lots to settlers and for whom the town was eventually renamed. The town was officially incorporated as Monroe Township in March 1859, with Williamstown as meeting place to vote and have town discussions. A municipal court was established in the Township of Monroe, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 264 of the Laws of 1948. The first school was built in 1750 and stood where the Washington Hotel now stands. The local schools operated on a pay-as-you-go basis until the 1850s and were predominantly church-run. The area built its first high school in 1958.

The population of the town remained small until the early 1830s when the glass industry sprung up (Glassboro, a neighboring town, still bears the name borne of that commercial boom). The first company to form was called Free Will Glass Manufacturing and caused a population surge. The industry thrived until the early 1900s when agricultural businesses began to flourish in the face of the waning glass industry. One notable company, The John Sharp Canning Co., still operates today as Blue Ribbon. The Monroe Township Historical Society was formed as a volunteer organization on October 16, 1974, by Mayor John W. Sharp (of the Canning Company Sharps), dedicated to the preservation of items that reflect the history of Monroe Township.

In 2014, the community had a death rate from heroin that was 25 times the national average, with about five people per year dying of overdoses and other complications in the previous decade.

<text>Woodbury is the county seat of Gloucester County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The city, along with the rest of Gloucester County, is part South Jersey and of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD combined statistical area, also known as the Delaware Valley or Philadelphia metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 9,963, a decrease of 211 (−2.1%) from the 2010 census count of 10,174, which in turn reflected a decline of 133 (−1.3%) from the 10,307 in the 2000 census.

Woodbury was originally formed as a borough on March 27, 1854, within Deptford Township based on the results of a March 22, 1854, referendum. On January 2, 1871, Woodbury was reincorporated as a city based on the results of a referendum held that day.

Inspira Health Network is based in Woodbury. The now-defunct Woodbury Country Club operated in Woodbury from 1897 to 2010, closing due to declining membership and mounting debt that led to its 2013 bankruptcy filing.

The city had the 14th-highest property tax rate in New Jersey with an equalized rate of 4.582% as of 2020 compared to 3.212% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==History==
As recounted by historian William McMahon, the Native Americans called the place where the city of Woodbury is now located &quot;Piscozackasing&quot;, or &quot;place of the black burrs&quot;.

Woodbury was founded in 1683 by Henry Wood, a Quaker from North West England who left Great Britain due to religious persecution. Wood was incarcerated in Lancaster for practicing as a Quaker and left his home in Tottington near Bury, Lancashire in a boat to set up a community in the new world where he and his family could practice his religion freely. His surname and hometown inspired naming the city that he founded Woodbury.

In 2000, Bury, England, and Woodbury were twinned as part of millennium celebrations in both countries. The twinning ceremony was the culmination of a week where more than 300 school children and college students, local dignitaries, and local residents from Bury took part in sporting and cultural events held in and around Woodbury. During the week, there was a symbolic meeting and reconciliation of the Vicar of Henry Wood&#x27;s former church in Tottington and the Quaker meeting house in Woodbury and an ecumenical service attended by many of the residents and visitors.

===Paleontological discovery===
In 1787, a fossil bone recovered in Woodbury from local Cretaceous strata was discussed by the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. The remains were only retrospectively identified as dinosaurian, as dinosaurs would not be scientifically recognized as a distinct group of reptiles until August 1841.

===Recycling===
Woodbury was the first city in the United States to mandate recycling. This effort was led by then-councilman and later mayor Donald P. Sanderson in the 1970s, and an ordinance was finally passed in December 1980. The idea of towing a recycling trailer behind a trash collection vehicle to enable the collection of trash and recyclable material at the same time emerged. Sanderson was asked to speak in municipalities throughout the country and other towns and cities soon followed suit.

===Historic district===
There are numerous contributing properties to the Broad Street Historic District encompassing Broad Street (located between Woodbury Creek and Courtland Street) Highland Mills, and Delaware Street (located between Broad and Wood streets) including the Gloucester County Courthouse, which was placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places (#1429) in 1988.

<doc id="125230" wikidata="Q812589" url="?curid=125230" title="Bayonne, New Jersey">
<text>Bayonne ( ) is a city in Hudson County in the U.S. state of New Jersey, in the Gateway Region on Bergen Neck, a peninsula between Newark Bay to the west, the Kill Van Kull to the south, and New York Bay to the east. At the 2020 United States census, it was the state&#x27;s 15th-most-populous municipality, surpassing Passaic, with a population of 71,686, an increase of 8,662 (+13.7%) from the 2010 census count of 63,024, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,182 (+1.9%) from the 61,842 counted in the 2000 census. The Census Bureau&#x27;s Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 70,300 for 2023, making it the 541st-most populous municipality in the nation.

Bayonne was formed as a township in 1861, from portions of Bergen Township, and reincorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature in 1869. At the time it was formed, Bayonne included the communities of Bergen Point, Constable Hook, Centreville, Pamrapo and Saltersville.

While somewhat diminished, traditional manufacturing, distribution, and maritime activities remain a driving force of the economy of the city. A portion of the Port of New York and New Jersey is located there, as is the Cape Liberty Cruise Port.

==History==
Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the region presently known as Bayonne was claimed by the Netherlands after Henry Hudson explored the Hudson River, which is named after him. According to Royden Page Whitcomb&#x27;s 1904 book, &quot;First History of Bayonne, New Jersey&quot;, the name Bayonne is speculated to have originated with Bayonne, France, from which Huguenots settled for a year before the founding of New Amsterdam. However, there is no empirical evidence for this notion. Whitcomb gives more credence to the idea that Erastus Randall, E.C. Bramhall and B.F. Woolsey, who bought the land owned by Jasper and William Cadmus for real estate speculation, named it Bayonne for purposes of real estate speculation, because it was located on the shores of two bays, Newark and New York.

Bayonne became one of the largest centers in the nation for refining crude oil and Standard Oil of New Jersey&#x27;s facility—which had grown from its original establishment in 1877—and its 6,000 employees made it the city&#x27;s largest employer. Significant civil unrest arose during the Bayonne refinery strikes of 1915–1916, in which mostly Polish-American workers staged labor actions against Standard Oil of New Jersey and Tidewater Petroleum, seeking improved pay and working conditions. Four striking workers were killed when strikebreakers, allegedly protected by police, fired upon a violent crowd.

The Cape Liberty Cruise Port is a cruise ship terminal that is on a site that had been originally developed for industrial uses in the 1930s and then taken over by the U.S. government during World War II as the Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne. &quot;Voyager of the Seas&quot;, departing from the cruise terminal in 2004, became the first passenger ship to depart from a port in New Jersey in almost 40 years.

==Local services==

===Municipal Utilities Authority===
The Bayonne Municipal Utilities Authority (BMUA) is the second agency to use wind power in New Jersey and has built the first wind turbine in the metropolitan area. Construction of a single turbine tower was completed in January 2012. It is the first wind turbine created by Leitwind to be installed in the United States.

In December 2012, the autonomous agency entered into a water management agreement with the Bayonne Water Joint Venture (BWJV), a partnership between United Water and investment firm KKR. The 40-year concession agreement is a public-private partnership between the city and the BWJV in which the private partners pay off the BMUA&#x27;s $130 million debt and take over the operations, maintenance, and capital improvement of Bayonne&#x27;s water and wastewater utilities in exchange for a regulated share of the revenue. United Water is managing the operations for the partnership, while KKR is providing 90% of the funding. A rate schedule was included in the agreement, and it contained an immediate 8.5% utility rate increase (the first rate increase since 2006), followed by two years without increases, followed by annual increases estimated to range between 2.5%–4.5%. This partnership was sought for several reasons, including the BMUA&#x27;s debt, its shortage of skilled employees, and its lagging rate revenue from years without rate increases and reduced demand. Part of this reduced demand stemmed from the closure of the Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne, and the fact that the subsequent plans to redevelop the site with housing fell short. The BMUA&#x27;s $130 million debt that was paid off by the BWJV represented over half of Bayonne&#x27;s overall debt ($240 million) at the time, and in March 2013, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service upgraded the credit rating of Bayonne from &#x27;negative&#x27; to &#x27;stable&#x27;, citing the water deal.

===Fire department===

The city of Bayonne has around 180 full-time professional firefighters consisting of the city of Bayonne Fire Department (BFD), which was founded on September 3, 1906, and operates out of five fire stations located throughout the city.

Each tour is commanded by a battalion chief.

The department is part of the Metro USAR Strike Team, which consists of nine North Jersey fire departments and other emergency services divisions working to address major emergency rescue situations.

===Office of Emergency Management===
The Office of Emergency Management (OEM) is charged with mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery for all disasters and emergencies within the city. Bayonne OEM coordinates emergency response of multiple agencies (Police, Fire, EMS, DPW). Bayonne OEM falls under Hudson County OEM and New Jersey State Police OEM, and is an EMAA certified city under the NJ State Police. Bayonne OEM has an active social media presence and utilizes a Text-Alert and Robocall system (Bay911 Emergency Notification System) to keep the community aware of major incidents and weather related alerts.

Bayonne&#x27;s local culture is served by the Annual Outdoor Art Show, which was instituted in 2008, in which local artists display their works.

In the 1983 novel &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Mark Helprin, which is set in a fantastical version of New York City and its surroundings, &quot;The Bayonne Marsh&quot; is the hidden, inaccessible home of the Marshmen, a race of fierce warriors.

Jackie Gleason, a former headliner at the Hi-Hat Club in Bayonne, was fascinated by the city and mentioned it often in the television series &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;.

Films set in Bayonne include the 1991 film &quot;Mortal Thoughts&quot;, with Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, which was filmed near Horace Mann School and locations around Bayonne and Hoboken; the 2000 drama &quot;Men of Honor&quot;, starring Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr.; the 2002 drama &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot;; and the 2005 Tom Cruise science fiction film &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, which opens at the Bayonne home of the lead character, and depicts the destruction of the Bayonne Bridge by aliens.

The November 16, 2010, episode of &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; parodied former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin&#x27;s reality television series, &quot;Sarah Palin&#x27;s Alaska&quot;, in the form of a trailer for a fictional reality show called &quot;Jason Jones&#x27; Bayonne, New Jersey&quot;, whose portrayal of the city was characterized by prostitution, drugs, crime, pollution and a stereotypical Italian-American population. Bayonne Mayor Mark Smith criticized the sketch, saying, &quot;Jon Stewart&#x27;s unfortunate and inaccurate depiction of Bayonne represents a lame attempt at humor at the expense of a rock solid, all-American community.&quot; It is also referenced in the humorous song &quot;The Rolling Mills of New Jersey&quot; by John Roberts and Tony Barrand as the narrator&#x27;s home town.

The comic strip &quot;Piranha Club&quot; (originally &quot;Ernie&quot;), drawn by Bud Grace, is set in and around Bayonne.

===Religion===
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark operates Catholic churches. Two in Bayonne, Blessed Miriam Teresa Demjanovich Church and St. John Paul II Church, were formed from consolidations, in 2016, because the number of people attending Catholic churches declined.

Demjanovich church is a merger of St. Andrew and St. Mary Star of the Sea churches, with the merged congregation keeping the two sites for worship. Reverend Alexander Santora in the &quot;Jersey Journal&quot; wrote that due to the efforts of the pastor, the Demjanovich merger &quot;went off, however, without a hitch.&quot;

Three other churches, Our Lady of the Assumption, Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, and St. Michael/St. Joseph, merged into John Paul II in 2016. There were unsuccessful protests to keep Assumption open, and the archdiocese committed to closing that church.

Bayonne&#x27;s Jewish community is served by Temple Beth Am (Reform), Temple Emanu-El (Conservative), Ohav Zedek (Orthodox), and Chabad (Orthodox).

==Transportation==

===Roads and highways===

, the city had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the city, are overseen by Hudson County, by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and are the responsibility of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

The Bayonne Bridge stretches , connecting south to Staten Island over the Kill Van Kull. Originally constructed in 1931, the bridge underwent a Navigation Clearance Project that was completed in 2017 at a cost of $1.7 billion, that raised the bridge deck from above the water to , allowing larger and more heavily laden cargo ships to clear their way under the bridge.

Several major roadways pass through the city. The Newark Bay Extension (Interstate 78) of the New Jersey Turnpike eastbound travels to Jersey City and, via the Holland Tunnel, Manhattan. Westbound, the Newark Bay Bridge provides access to Newark, Newark Liberty International Airport and the rest of the turnpike (Interstate 95).

Kennedy Boulevard (County Route 501) is a major thoroughfare along the west side of the city from the Bayonne Bridge north to Jersey City and North Hudson.

Route 440 runs along the east side of Bayonne, and the West Side of Jersey City, partially following the path of the old Morris Canal route. It connects to the Bayonne Bridge, I-78, and to Route 185 to Liberty State Park.

===Public transportation===

The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail has four stops in Bayonne, all originally from the former Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ). They are located at 45th Street, 34th Street, 22nd Street, all just east of Avenue E, and 8th Street (the southern terminal of the 8th Street-Hoboken Line) at Avenue C, which opened in January 2011.

Bus transportation is provided on three main north–south streets of the city: Broadway, Kennedy Boulevard, and Avenue C, both by the state-operated NJ Transit and several private bus lines. The Broadway line runs solely inside Bayonne city limits, while bus lines on Avenue C and Kennedy Boulevard run to various end points in Jersey City. The NJ Transit 120 runs between Avenue C in Bayonne and Battery Park in Downtown Manhattan during rush hours in peak direction while the 81 provides service to Jersey City.

MTA Regional Bus Operations provides bus service between Bayonne and Staten Island on the S89 route, which connects the 34th Street light rail station and the Eltingville neighborhood on Staten Island with no other stops in Bayonne. It is the first interstate bus service operated by the New York City Transit Authority.

For 114 years, the CNJ ran frequent service through the city. Trains ran north to the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal in Jersey City. Trains ran west to Elizabethport, Elizabeth and Cranford for points west and south. The implementation of the Aldene Connection in 1967 bypassed CNJ trains around Bayonne so that nearly all trains would either terminate at Newark Pennsylvania Station or at Hoboken Terminal. By 1973, a lightly used shuttle between Bayonne and Cranford that operated 20 times per day was the final remnant of service on the line. Until August 6, 1978, a shuttle service between Bayonne and Cranford retained the last leg of service with the CNJ trains.

<text>Anne, Princess Royal (Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise; born 15 August 1950) is a member of the British royal family. She is the second child and only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and the only sister of King Charles III. Anne was born third in the line of succession to the British throne and is now 18th, and has been, since 1987, Princess Royal, a title held for life.

Born at Clarence House, Anne was educated at Benenden School and began undertaking royal duties upon reaching adulthood. She became a respected equestrian, winning one gold medal in 1971 and two silver medals in 1975 at the European Eventing Championships. In 1976, she became the first member of the British royal family to compete in the Olympic Games. In 1988, the Princess Royal became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Anne performs official duties and engagements on behalf of the monarch. She is patron or president of more than 300 organisations, including WISE, Riders for Health, and Carers Trust. Her work in charities centres on sports, sciences, people with disabilities, and health in developing countries. She has been associated with Save the Children for more than fifty years and has visited a number of its projects.

Anne married Captain Mark Phillips in 1973; they separated in 1989 and divorced in 1992. They have two children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, and five grandchildren. Within months of her divorce in 1992, Anne married Commander (later Vice Admiral) Sir Timothy Laurence, whom she had met while he served as her mother&#x27;s equerry between 1986 and 1989.

==Early life and education==

Anne was born at 11:50 a.m. BST on 15 August 1950 at Clarence House during the reign of her maternal grandfather, King George VI. She is the second child and only daughter of Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. A 21-gun salute in Hyde Park signaled the birth. Anne was baptised in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace on 21 October 1950, by the Archbishop of York, Cyril Garbett. At the time of her birth, she was third in the line of succession to the British throne, behind her mother and older brother, Charles (later King Charles III). She rose to second in 1952 after her grandfather&#x27;s death and her mother&#x27;s accession; she is currently 18th in line.

A governess, Catherine Peebles, was appointed to look after Anne and her brothers, Charles, Andrew, and Edward. Peebles was responsible for Anne&#x27;s early education at Buckingham Palace. Given her young age at the time, Anne did not attend her mother&#x27;s coronation in June 1953.

A Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace Company to include the Holy Trinity Brompton Brownie pack, was re-formed in May 1959, specifically so that, as her mother and her aunt Princess Margaret had done as children, Anne could socialise with girls her own age. The company was active until 1963, when Anne went to boarding school. Anne enrolled at Benenden School in 1963. In 1968, she left school with six GCE O-Levels and two A-Levels. She began to undertake royal engagements in 1969, at the age of 18.

In 1970, Anne briefly had a relationship with Andrew Parker Bowles, who later married Camilla Shand. Camilla later became the second wife and queen consort of Anne&#x27;s elder brother, Charles III. Anne was also briefly linked to Olympic equestrian Richard Meade.

==Equestrianism==

In spring 1971, Princess Anne finished fourth at the Rushall Horse Trials. At age 21, she won the individual title at the European Eventing Championship with her home-bred horse Doublet and was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1971. She also rode winners in horse racing, competing in the Grand Military Steeplechase at Sandown Park Racecourse and the Diamond Stakes at Royal Ascot.
For more than five years, Anne also competed with the British eventing team, winning a silver medal in both individual and team disciplines in the 1975 European Eventing Championship. The following year, she participated in the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal as a member of the British team, riding the Queen&#x27;s horse, Goodwill, in Eventing. Anne suffered a concussion halfway through the course but remounted and finished the event; she has stated she cannot remember making the rest of the jumps. The British team had to pull out of the competition after two horses were injured. She finished fourth at the Badminton Horse Trials in 1974 and sixth in 1979, having participated five times in the competition between 1971 and 1979. In 1985, she rode in a charity horse race at the Epsom Derby, finishing fourth.

Anne assumed the presidency of the Fédération Équestre Internationale from 1986 until 1994. On 5 February 1987, she became the first member of the royal family to appear as a contestant on a television quiz show when she competed on the BBC panel game &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;. The princess has been a patron of the Riding for the Disabled Association since 1971 and became its president in 1985, a position she still holds.

In June 2024, Anne was taken to Southmead Hospital with minor injuries and concussion believed to be caused by impact with a horse&#x27;s legs or head.

==Marriages and children==

===Marriage to Mark Phillips===

Anne met Mark Phillips, a lieutenant in the 1st Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards, in 1968 at a party for horse lovers. Their engagement was announced on 29 May 1973. On 14 November 1973, the couple married at Westminster Abbey in a televised ceremony, with an estimated audience of 100 million. They subsequently took up residence at Gatcombe Park. As was customary for untitled men marrying into the royal family, Phillips was offered an earldom, which he declined; consequently their children were born without titles. Anne and her husband had two children: Peter (born 1977) and Zara Phillips (born 1981). Anne and Phillips have five grandchildren. On 31 August 1989, Anne and Phillips announced their intention to separate; the couple had been rarely seen in public together and both were romantically linked with other people. They shared custody of their children, and initially announced that &quot;there were no plans for divorce.&quot; On 13 April 1992, the Palace announced that Anne had filed for divorce, which was finalised ten days later.

===Marriage to Sir Timothy Laurence===
Anne met Timothy Laurence, a commander in the Royal Navy, while he was serving on the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;. Their relationship developed in early 1989, three years after Laurence was appointed as an equerry to the Queen. In 1989, the existence of private letters from Laurence to Anne was revealed by &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. The couple married at Crathie Kirk near Balmoral Castle in Scotland, on 12 December 1992. Approximately 30 guests were invited for the private marriage service. Unlike the Church of England at the time, the Church of Scotland did not consider marriage to be a binding sacrament and so permitted the remarriage of divorced persons under certain circumstances. Anne became the first royal divorcée to remarry since Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, granddaughter of Queen Victoria.

For the wedding ceremony, Anne wore a white jacket over a &quot;demure, cropped-to-the-knee dress&quot; and a spray of white flowers in her hair. Her engagement ring was made of &quot;a cabochon sapphire flanked by three small diamonds on each side&quot;. Following the marriage service, the couple and guests headed to Craigowan Lodge for a private reception. Laurence received no peerage, although was knighted in 2011.

==Kidnapping attempt==
On 20 March 1974, Princess Anne and Mark Phillips were returning to Buckingham Palace from a charity event when a Ford Escort forced their Princess IV car to stop on The Mall. The driver of the Escort, Ian Ball, jumped out and began firing a pistol. Inspector James Beaton, Anne&#x27;s personal protection officer, exited the car to shield her and to try to disarm Ball. Beaton&#x27;s firearm, a Walther PPK, jammed, and he was shot by Ball, as was Anne&#x27;s chauffeur, Alex Callender, when he tried to disarm Ball. Brian McConnell, a nearby tabloid journalist, also intervened, and was shot in the chest. Ball approached Anne&#x27;s car and told her that he intended to kidnap her and hold her for ransom, the sum given by varying sources as £2 million or £3 million, which he claimed he intended to give to the National Health Service. Ball told Anne to get out of the car, to which she replied, &quot;Not bloody likely!&quot; She reportedly briefly considered hitting Ball. In 1983, she spoke about the event on &quot;Parkinson&quot;, saying she was &#x27;scrupulously polite&#x27; to Ball as she thought it would be &#x27;silly to be too rude at that stage&#x27;.

Eventually, Anne exited the other side of the limousine, as had her lady-in-waiting, Rowena Brassey. A passing pedestrian, a former boxer named Ron Russell, punched Ball and led Anne away from the scene. At that point, Police Constable Michael Hills happened upon the scene; he too was shot by Ball, but he had already called for police backup. Detective Constable Peter Edmonds answered, gave chase, and finally arrested Ball. Beaton, who had been Anne&#x27;s sole bodyguard, later said about royal security &quot;I had nothing… There was no back-up vehicle. The training was non-existent; but then again, [we thought] nothing was going to happen. They are highly specialised now, highly trained.&quot; Immediately after the attack the use of only a single protection officer was stopped, and the Walther PPK pistol was replaced.

Beaton, Hills, Callender, and McConnell were hospitalised, and recovered from their wounds. For his defence of Princess Anne, Beaton was awarded the George Cross by the Queen, who was visiting Indonesia when the incident occurred; Hills and Russell were awarded the George Medal, and Callender, McConnell, and Edmonds were awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal. Anne visited Beaton in hospital and thanked him for his assistance. It was widely reported that the Queen paid off Russell&#x27;s mortgage, but this is not true: Russell said in 2020 that a police officer suggested it might happen, so he stopped paying his mortgage in anticipation and nearly had his house repossessed after four months.

Ball pleaded guilty to attempted murder and kidnapping. , he was still detained under the &quot;Mental Health Act&quot; at Broadmoor Hospital, having been diagnosed with schizophrenia.

The attempted kidnapping of Princess Anne is the focus of the Granada Television-produced docudrama &quot;To Kidnap a Princess&quot; (2006) and inspired story lines in Tom Clancy&#x27;s novel &quot;Patriot Games&quot;.

==Activities==
===Public appearances===

Anne undertakes a number of duties and engagements on behalf of the sovereign. Kevin S. MacLeod, the then Canadian Secretary to the Queen, said of Anne in 2014: &quot;Her credo is, &#x27;Keep me busy. I&#x27;m here to work. I&#x27;m here to do good things. I&#x27;m here to meet as many people as possible&#x27;.&quot; It was reported in December 2017 that the Princess Royal had undertaken the most official engagements that year out of all the royal family, her mother the Queen included. Among her royal visits, the Princess has toured Norway, Jamaica, Germany, Austria, New Zealand, and Australia.
Anne&#x27;s first public engagement was at the opening of an educational and training centre in Shropshire in 1969. Anne travels abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom up to three times a year. She began to undertake overseas visits upon leaving secondary school, and accompanied her parents on a state visit to Austria in the same year. Her first tour of Australia was with her parents in 1970, since which she returned many times to undertake official engagements as a colonel-in-chief of an Australian regiment, or to attend memorials and services such as the National Memorial Service for victims of the Black Saturday bushfires in Melbourne on 22 February 2009. In 1990 she became the first member of the royal family to make an official visit to the Soviet Union when she went there as a guest of President Mikhail Gorbachev and his government.
In August 2016, she returned to Russia to visit the city of Arkhangelsk for the 75th anniversary of Operation Dervish, which was one of the first Arctic convoys of World War II. In September 2016, the Princess had a chest infection and was required to cancel official engagements. In late October 2016, she visited the Malaysian state of Sarawak for a two-day study tour. In April 2022, Anne and her husband toured Australia and Papua New Guinea to mark the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee. On 12 September 2022, in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, Edinburgh, Anne became the first woman to participate in a Vigil of the Princes, guarding her mother&#x27;s coffin. This was repeated at Westminster Hall on 16 September. It was later revealed that she had been the informant at her mother&#x27;s death at Balmoral, a witness who signs, along with the doctor, the death certificate.

===Patronages===

Anne is involved with more than 200 charities and organisations in an official capacity. She works extensively for Save the Children, serving as president from 1970 to 2017, and has been patron since 2017. Anne has visited the organisation&#x27;s projects in Bangladesh, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Mozambique, Ethiopia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a result of her work, she was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 by Kenneth Kaunda, President of Zambia. She initiated The Princess Royal Trust for Carers in 1991. Her extensive work for St. John Ambulance as Commandant-in-Chief of St. John Ambulance Cadets has helped to develop many young people, as she annually attends the Grand Prior Award Reception. She is patron of St. Andrew&#x27;s First Aid. In 2021, she became patron of Mercy Ships, an international charity that operates the largest non-governmental hospital ships in the world.

Anne is a British representative in the International Olympic Committee as an administrator, and was a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. She also serves as president of the British Olympic Association. Anne represented Great Britain in the International Olympic Committee at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia. In 1985 she became president of the Riding for the Disabled Association after serving as their patron for fourteen years. She maintains a relationship with student sport and is the patron of British Universities and Colleges Sport.

Following the retirement of the Queen Mother in 1981, Anne was elected by graduates of the University of London as the Chancellor, and has been in the position since that year. She was president of BAFTA from 1973 to 2001. Throughout May 1996, Anne served as Her Majesty&#x27;s High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and held the post again in 2017. In 2007, she was appointed by the Queen as Grand Master of the Royal Victorian Order, a position her grandmother had also held. She is a Royal Fellow of the Royal Society and the Academy of Medical Sciences. Royal Fellows are members of the royal family who are recommended and elected by the Society&#x27;s Council. The Royal Society has four Royal Fellows: Anne; William, Prince of Wales; Edward, Duke of Kent; and King Charles. She is the Academy of Medical Sciences&#x27; first Royal Fellow. Anne was elected Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh effective 31 March 2011, succeeding her father, who stepped down from the role in 2010. Likewise, she accepted in 2011 the roles of president of City and Guilds of London Institute, Master of the Corporation of Trinity House and president of the Royal Society of Arts, also in succession to her father. Anne has been the president of the Commonwealth Study Conference, an initiative founded by her father. In 2023, she succeeded the Duke of Kent as president of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
Anne is the patron of Transaid, a charity founded by Save the Children and the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport which aims to provide safe and sustainable transport in developing countries. She is also the royal patron of WISE, an organisation that encourages young women to pursue careers in science, engineering and construction. She has been patron of the Royal National Children&#x27;s Foundation since 2002 and the industrial heritage museum, Aerospace Bristol, since 2016. In 2022, Anne was named honorary chair of National Lighthouse Museum&#x27;s Illuminating Future Generations campaign, a project aimed at raising funds for the museum&#x27;s gallery space. She is also patron of the Royal College of Occupational Therapists, the Special Forces Club, Royal College of Midwives, Royal College of Emergency Medicine, Magpas Air Ambulance, Edinburgh University&#x27;s Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, Royal Holloway, University of London, International Students House, London, Acid Survivors Trust International, Townswomen&#x27;s Guilds, Citizens Advice, the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the Scottish Rugby Union, and the Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.

In 1986 she was appointed Master of the Worshipful Company of Carmen. In 2001, she became Master of the Worshipful Company of Farmers. In 2017, Anne became Prime Warden of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and a Governor of Gresham&#x27;s School. In 2025, Anne was announced as patron of Friends of the Elderly, taking on the role which Queen Elizabeth II had previously held for over 60 years.

==Public image and style==

Anne has been called the royal family&#x27;s &quot;trustiest anchor&quot; and a &quot;beacon of good, old-fashioned public service&quot;, having carried out more than 20,000 engagements since her 18th birthday. In her early adulthood, she was cited as a &quot;royal renegade&quot; for choosing to forgo titles for her children despite being the &quot;spare to the heir&quot;. The media often called the young Anne &quot;aloof&quot; and &quot;haughty&quot;, giving her the nickname &quot;her royal rudeness&quot;. She spurred controversy for telling photographers to &quot;naff off&quot; at the Badminton Horse Trials in 1982. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote that Anne &quot;has a reputation for having inherited her father&#x27;s famously sharp tongue and waspish wit&quot;. Of her early public role, she has said: &quot;It&#x27;s not just about &#x27;can I get a tick in the box for doing this?&#x27; No, it&#x27;s about serving…It took me probably 10 years before I really felt confident enough to contribute to Save the Children&#x27;s public debates because you needed to understand how it works on the ground and that needed a very wide coverage. So my early trips were really important.&quot; Anne has been frequently named the &quot;hardest working royal&quot;, and she carried out 11,088 engagements between 2002 and 2022, more than any other member of the royal family.

Anne remains one of Britain&#x27;s most popular royals. &quot;Telegraph&quot; editor Camilla Tominey called her a &quot;national treasure&quot;, writing that she is &quot;hailed as one of the great English eccentrics&quot;, whose work ethic contributes to her regard. Tominey wrote that Anne&#x27;s public role is a &quot;contradiction of both protocol taskmaster and occasional rule-breaker&quot;. Reportedly, Anne &quot;insists on doing her own make-up and hair&quot; and drives herself to engagements, having pleaded guilty to two separate speeding fines on account of being late. She does not shake hands with the public during walkabouts, saying, &quot;the theory was that you couldn&#x27;t shake hands with everybody, so don&#x27;t start.&quot; Members of the public have seen her &quot;mending fences at Gatcombe&quot; and &quot;queuing up for the Portaloos&quot; at her daughter&#x27;s horse competitions. Her reputation is also coupled with her advocacy for causes out of the mainstream, such as Wetwheels Foundation&#x27;s commitment to accessible sailing and the National Lighthouse Museum. On her 60th and 70th birthdays, the BBC and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; both asked whether she would retire, and she denied it both times, citing her parents&#x27; example as well as her commitment to her royal duties. Anne&#x27;s public personality has been described as &quot;not suffering fools lightly&quot; while maintaining a &quot;still-impressive level of grace and courtesy&quot;.

British &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Edward Enninful has said that &quot;Princess Anne is a true style icon and was all about sustainable fashion before the rest of us really knew what that meant&quot;. Her style has been noted for its timelessness; she relies almost solely on British fashion brands, with tweed and tailored suits as her hallmarks. She is known for recycling outfits, such as her floral-print dress worn both to the wedding of the Prince of Wales in 1981 and the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor in 2008. Anne is the patron of U.K. Fashion and Textile Association. She has been noted for wearing &quot;bold patterns and vibrant pops of colour&quot;. Her style choices often reflect her equestrian interests as well as the practicality of her fast-paced schedule. In the 1970s and 1980s, she was often photographed wearing trends such as puff sleeves, cardigans, bright floral patterns, and multicoloured stripes. Anne is also one of the few women in the royal family to wear a military uniform. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she is &quot;rarely seen without a brooch&quot; during royal events. Her millinery styles have included jockey caps and hats of multiple colours and bold patterns. She presented the Queen Elizabeth II award for British design at London Fashion Week in 2020. Anne has appeared on three British &quot;Vogue&quot; covers; after first appearing on the 1971 September issue at age 21, she also featured in the May and November 1973 issues, commemorating her engagement to Mark Phillips. She was featured in the cover story for the May 2020 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. In 2024, &quot;Tatler&quot; included her on its list of the most glamorous European royals.

Anne is the first member of the royal family to have been convicted of a criminal offence. In November 2002, she pleaded guilty to one charge of having a dog dangerously out of control, an offence under the &quot;Dangerous Dogs Act 1991&quot;, and was fined £500.

<doc id="125233" wikidata="Q1021545" url="?curid=125233" title="Guttenberg, New Jersey">
<text>Guttenberg ( ) is a town in the northern part of Hudson County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. In the 2020 Census, it was the most densely populated incorporated municipality in the United States, as well as one of the most densely populated municipalities worldwide, with of land area. Only four blocks wide north to south, Guttenberg has been variously ranked as the ninth-smallest municipality in the state (based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau) or as the state&#x27;s seventh-smallest municipality (based on data from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection).

As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 12,017, an increase of 841 (+7.5%) from the 2010 census count of 11,176, which in turn reflected an increase of 369 (+3.4%) from the 10,807 counted in the 2000 census. As of the 2010 Census, almost one-fifth of the town&#x27;s population resided in the Galaxy Towers, a trio of residential skyscrapers overlooking the Hudson River.

The current population growth and density in Guttenberg represents a significant change since 1983, when it was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as &quot;an old community of two-story row houses, small stores and light industry.&quot; Based on data from the 2017 Population Estimates Program showing that the town had a population density of , the highest in the state, Dave Sheingold of &quot;Northjersey.com&quot; described Guttenberg as &quot;America&#x27;s most crowded place&quot;.

==History==
Guttenberg was formerly a farm owned by William Cooper, sold in 1853 to a group of New Yorkers, who had formed the Weehawken Land and Ferry Association. Like nearby Union Hill, it was subdivided and lots were sold mostly to Germans. The company ran two ferries, the &quot;Hultz&quot; and the &quot;Flora&quot;, which crossed the Hudson from the landings at the foot of Bulls Ferry Road, Pleasant Valley, Fort Lee, and Spring Street in Manhattan.

Guttenberg was formed as a town on March 9, 1859, from portions of North Bergen Township, but remained as a part of the township that was not fully independent. Guttenberg became part of Union Township when it was formed on February 28, 1861, and became fully independent as of April 1, 1878. The municipality takes its name from Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the European version of the printing press, though other sources indicate that the name derives from &quot;good village&quot; in German.

Galaxy Towers, developed by Prudential Insurance Company, were built in the late 1970s on Boulevard East. The three octagonal skyscrapers rise and contain 1,075 apartments.

==Geography==
Guttenberg is located atop the Hudson Palisades, south of Woodcliff and the Racetrack Section in North Bergen and north of West New York. To the east the town shares a border the New York City borough of Manhattan (Upper West Side) in the Hudson River. Its western border is Kennedy Boulevard. Bergenline Avenue, the commercial corridor of North Hudson, runs north and south through the town, and is the heart of &quot;Havana on the Hudson&quot;.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 0.24 square miles (0.62 km2), including 0.19 square miles (0.50 km2) of land and 0.05 square miles (0.12 km2) of water (20.00%). The town is four blocks long, and takes less than a minute to drive through.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 11,176 people, 4,473 households, and 2,684 families in the town. The population density was 57,116.0 per square mile (22,052.6/km2). There were 4,839 housing units at an average density of 24,730.2 per square mile (9,548.4/km2). The racial makeup was 67.44% (7,537) White, 4.80% (537) Black or African American, 0.91% (102) Native American, 7.32% (818) Asian, 0.04% (4) Pacific Islander, 14.25% (1,593) from other races, and 5.23% (585) from two or more races.

<doc id="125234" wikidata="Q336330" url="?curid=125234" title="Harrison, New Jersey">
<text>Harrison is a town in the western part of Hudson County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is part of the New York metropolitan area. It is a suburb of the nearby city of Newark, New Jersey, and is located from New York City. Once considered &quot;the beehive of industry&quot;, the town is undergoing a residential renewal, particularly along the Passaic River.

As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 19,450, an increase of 5,830 (+42.8%) from the 2010 census count of 13,620, which in turn reflected a decrease of 804 (−5.6%) from the 14,424 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
===Colonial era to 19th century===
The area that is now Harrison was the southernmost part of the land grant awarded to William Sandford in 1668. When that grant was divided in 1671 between Sandford and his uncle, Nathaniel Kingsland of Barbados, Sandford&#x27;s share included Harrison. While Sandford and his family established a plantation on the northern portion of his tract, there is no evidence they developed any significant part of Harrison. Upon his death in 1691, Sandford&#x27;s land passed to his wife, Sarah Sandford (née Whartman). Upon her death , she passed most of the land, including Harrison, to her son William (). In 1729, William transferred the southern parts of his upland to three of his sons, John, Robert and Peter, each receiving a lot that included a portion of Harrison&#x27;s upland. John and Robert sold their lots to members of the Schuyler family in 1733 and 1736, respectively, and migrated westward, John to Newark and Robert to Pine Brook. The disposition of Peter&#x27;s lot is not known, but no further record of him is found in or near Harrison.

A road to the Hudson Waterfront was completed in 1750, named for Douwe&#x27;s Ferry which it met at its eastern end to cross the Hackensack River. In 1790 the state legislature decided that &quot;public good would be served by a 64-foot road from Paulus Hook to Newark Courthouse&quot;. By 1795, a bridge over the Hackensack long and another over the Passaic long (at the site of the Bridge Street Bridge) were built creating an uninterrupted toll road connection. It is now known as the Newark Turnpike.

In 1826, the New Jersey Legislature formed Lodi Township from the southern portion of New Barbadoes Neck in Bergen County. Since Lodi Township was part of Bergen County, matters dealing with the county government and courts had to be taken to Hackensack.

In 1840, the inhabitants of Lodi Township joined with present-day Secaucus, Bayonne, Jersey City, Hoboken, Weehawken, and Union City and petitioned for the creation of a new county due to the great distance which the petitioners had to travel to reach the county seat in Hackensack. This appeal resulted in the creation of Hudson County and the first mention of Harrison occurs in the law which was passed on April 13, 1840. Harrison Township was thereby established.

The first committee meeting of the Township of Harrison was held on April 16, 1840, and it is widely accepted that Harrison was named for President William Henry Harrison, who was elected that year.

===19th century to present===
Union Township (now Lyndhurst) was created as of February 19, 1852, from portions of the township and became part of Bergen County.

General N. N. Halstead succeeded in getting the necessary laws passed in Trenton and on April 8, 1867, Kearny became a separate Township from land that was a part of Harrison, which included East Newark at the time; East Newark later seceded from Kearny, establishing their own Borough. On March 25, 1869, Harrison town was incorporated, replacing the township.

While campaigning for re-election in 1912, President William Howard Taft told residents gathered for a rally that &quot;you have reason to be proud of this Hive of Industry&quot;, from which was coined the town&#x27;s motto, &quot;The Beehive of Industry&quot;, which is still used today.

The town&#x27;s proximity to rail lines and a large waterfront made Harrison favorably situated for trade. Some of the industries which called Harrison home included the Edison Lamp Works, Worthington Pump and Machinery, the RCA Company, the Peter Hauck Brewery, Driver-Harris Company, Crucible Steel Company, Otis Elevator, Hartz Mountain, Remco Industries, Nopco Chemical and Hyatt Roller Bearing.

As the U.S. moved into the 20th century, these facilities played a major role in the development of new products for both the private and public sector, peaking during World War II. The small town of about only 14,000 residents had more than 90,000 workers commuting into it on a daily basis. In the 21st century the town is undergoing a transformation from a manufacturing center to a residential and service sector town.

The governing body is comprised of the mayor and Town Council, all of whom are elected on a partisan basis as part of the November general elections. A mayor is elected directly by the voters at-large to a four-year term of office. The Town Council includes eight members who are elected to serve four-year terms on a staggered basis, with one seat from each of the town&#x27;s four wards up for vote one year, one seat from each of the four wards up the next year and then two years with no elections.

The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in &quot;Abbott v. Burke&quot; which are now referred to as &quot;SDA Districts&quot; based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. As of the 2018–19 school year, the district, comprised of four schools, had an enrollment of 2,409 students and 166.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 14.5:1.

==Civic organizations==
Harrison Lions Club was chartered on July 25, 1951. The Harrison Club is part of Multiple District 16 (New Jersey) which is part of Lions Clubs International (LCI), the world&#x27;s largest service organization.

==Transportation==


===Roads and highways===
, the town had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Hudson County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

Interstate 280 runs through the center of the town. Westward, I-280 leads to Route 21, the Garden State Parkway, and Interstate 80. Eastward, it leads to Route 7 and the New Jersey Turnpike.

Replacement of Interstate 280&#x27;s partial access in central Harrison with service roads, a new interchange, and an overpass (to improve access to Harrison Avenue, the PATH station, and Sports Illustrated Stadium, and to give north–south passage to local street traffic) is in the planning stages.

===Public transportation===
The Harrison station on the PATH rapid transit system offers service to Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken and New York City. The station was built in 1913 and relocated to its present location in 1936. A major reconstruction for the Harrison Station was approved on March 28, 2012, and construction started in January 2013. The completion target, originally scheduled for April 2017, was tentatively moved to 2018; the expansion of the station was completed on June 15, 2019.

The Northeast Corridor, built in the 19th century by the Pennsylvania Railroad and now owned by Amtrak, carries NJ Transit trains, and passes through the city on the same alignment as the PATH. There was a stop on the Northeast Corridor in Harrison, but it was eliminated due to the ease of picking up trains in Newark at Penn Station.

Harrison is served by buses operated by several bus companies. NJ Transit offers service within New Jersey on the 30, 40 routes.

The closest airport in New Jersey with scheduled passenger service is Newark Liberty International Airport, located away in Newark and Elizabeth.

==Harrison Waterfront Development Plan==

The Harrison Waterfront Redevelopment Plan invited developers to submit plans that capitalize on the presence of the Harrison PATH Station and the Passaic River within a area that covers 35% of the whole town. The Plan seeks to unite the developers&#x27; proposals with a design theme that includes motifs from Harrison&#x27;s industrial, cultural, and environmental history as a means of fostering a new identity for Harrison that provides a variety of mixed-use, transit-oriented, pedestrian-scale development that will make Harrison a regional destination.

==Sports Illustrated Stadium==
Harrison is the location of Sports Illustrated Stadium, home of the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer and NJ/NY Gotham FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League. After years of construction delays, the stadium opened on March 20, 2010, with an exhibition game against the Brazilian club Santos FC. The soccer-specific stadium (SSS) was constructed at a cost of $200 million and has a capacity of approximately 25,000, with a natural grass field, featuring a full wavy translucent European-style roof that covers all of the seats in the stadium but not the field. The stadium sits alongside the Passaic River with a view of the New York and Newark skyline, and is accessible via public transportation at the PATH train station in Harrison.

<text>Hoboken ( ; ) is a city in Hudson County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Hoboken is part of the New York metropolitan area and is the site of Hoboken Terminal, a major transportation hub. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 60,419, an increase of 10,414 (+20.8%) from the 2010 census count of 50,005, which in turn reflected an increase of 11,428 (+29.6%) from the 38,577 counted in the 2000 census. The Census Bureau&#x27;s Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 57,010 for 2023, making it the 708th-most populous municipality in the nation. With more than in data from the 2010 census, Hoboken was ranked as the third-most densely populated municipality in the United States among cities with a population above 50,000. In the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population density climbed to more than of land, ranked fourth in the county behind Guttenberg, Union City and West New York.

Hoboken was first settled by Europeans as part of the Pavonia, New Netherland colony in the 17th century. During the early 19th century, the city was developed by Colonel John Stevens, first as a resort and later as a residential neighborhood. Originally part of Bergen Township and later North Bergen Township, it became a separate township in 1849 and was incorporated as a city in 1855. Hoboken is the location of the first recorded game of baseball and of the Stevens Institute of Technology, one of the oldest technological universities in the United States. It is also known as the birthplace and hometown of Frank Sinatra; various streets and parks in the city have been named after him.

Located on the Hudson Waterfront, the city was an integral part of the Port of New York and New Jersey and was home to major industries for most of the 20th century. The character of the city has changed from an artsy industrial vibe from the days when Maxwell House coffee, Lipton tea, Hostess Cupcakes, and Wonder Bread called Hoboken home, to one of trendy shops and expensive condominiums. It was ranked 2nd in Niche&#x27;s &quot;2019 Best Places to Live in Hudson County&quot; list, and 1st in 2022.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name Hoboken was chosen by Colonel John Stevens when he bought land, on a part of which the city still sits. The Lenape, later called Delaware Indian tribe of Native Americans, referred to the area as the &quot;land of the tobacco pipe&quot;, most likely to refer to the soapstone collected there to carve tobacco pipes, and used a phrase that became &quot;Hopoghan Hackingh&quot;. Like Weehawken, its neighbor to the north, as well as Communipaw and Harsimus to the south, Hoboken had many variations in the folks-tongue. &quot;Hoebuck&quot;, old Dutch for high bluff, and likely referring to Castle Point, the district of the city highest above sea level, was used during the colonial era, and was later spelled as &quot;Hobuck&quot;, &quot;Hobock&quot;, &quot;Hobuk&quot; and &quot;Hoboocken&quot;. However, in the nineteenth century, the name was changed to Hoboken, influenced by Flemish immigrants, and a folk etymology had emerged, linking the town of Hoboken to the similarly-named Hoboken district of Antwerp.

Hoboken has been nicknamed the Mile Square City, but it actually occupies about of land. During the late 19th/early 20th century the population and culture of Hoboken was dominated by German language speakers who sometimes called it &quot;Little Bremen&quot;, many of whom are buried in Hoboken Cemetery, North Bergen.

===Early-European arrival and colonial period===

Hoboken was originally an island which was surrounded by the Hudson River on the east and tidal lands at the foot of the New Jersey Palisades on the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory of the Hackensack, a phratry of the Lenni Lenape, who used the serpentine rock found there to carve pipes.

The first recorded European to lay claim to the area was Henry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company, who anchored his ship the &quot;Halve Maen&quot; (&quot;Half Moon&quot;) at Weehawken Cove on October 2, 1609. An entry made in the journal of Hudson&#x27;s mate, Robert Juet, on that date, is the earliest known reference to the area today known as Hoboken, and would be the last known such reference until twenty years later. Soon after the area became part of the province of New Netherland.

In 1630, Michael Reyniersz Pauw, a burgemeester (mayor) of Amsterdam and a director of the Dutch West India Company, received a land grant as patroon on the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named the North River. Three Lenape sold the land that became Hoboken and part of Jersey City for 80 fathoms (146 m) of wampum, 20 fathoms (37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle, and half a barrel of beer. These transactions, variously dated as July 12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance for the area. Pauw, whose Latinized name is Pavonia, failed to settle the land, and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the company in 1633.

It was later acquired by Hendrick Van Vorst, who leased part of the land to Aert Van Putten, a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North America&#x27;s first. In series of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia, as the colony was then known, were ordered back to New Amsterdam.

In 1664, the English took possession of New Amsterdam with little to no resistance, and in 1668 they confirmed a previous land patent by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674–1675, the area became part of East Jersey, and the province was divided into four administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part of Bergen County, where it remained until the creation of Hudson County on February 22, 1840. English-speaking settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, but it remained sparsely populated and agrarian.

Eventually, the land came into the possession of William Bayard, who originally supported the revolutionary cause, but became a Loyalist Tory after the fall of New York in 1776 when the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the renamed Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of the Revolutionary War, Bayard&#x27;s property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as &quot;William Bayard&#x27;s farm at Hoebuck&quot; was bought at auction by Colonel John Stevens for £18,360 (then $90,000).

===19th century===

In the early 19th century, Colonel John Stevens developed the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites. On October 11, 1811, Stevens&#x27; ship the &quot;Juliana&quot;, began to operate as a ferry between Manhattan and Hoboken, making it the world&#x27;s first commercial steam ferry. In 1825, he designed and built a steam locomotive capable of hauling several passenger cars at his estate. Sybil&#x27;s Cave, a cave with a natural spring, was opened in 1832 and visitors came to pay a penny for a glass of water from the cave which was said to have medicinal powers. In 1841, the cave became a legend, when Edgar Allan Poe wrote &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; about an event that took place there. The cave was closed in the late 1880s after the water was found to be contaminated, and it was shut and in the 1930s and filled with concrete, before it was reopened in 2008. Before his death in 1838, Stevens founded the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, which laid out a regular system of streets, blocks and lots, constructed housing, and developed manufacturing sites. In general, the housing consisted of masonry row houses of three to five stories, some of which survive to the present day, as does the street grid.

Hoboken was originally formed as a township on April 9, 1849, from portions of North Bergen Township. As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken&#x27;s residents saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held on March 29, 1855, ratified an Act of the New Jersey Legislature signed the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born. In the subsequent election, Cornelius V. Clickener became Hoboken&#x27;s first mayor. On March 15, 1859, the Township of Weehawken was created from portions of Hoboken and North Bergen Township.

Based on a bequest from Edwin A. Stevens, Stevens Institute of Technology was founded at Castle Point in 1870, at the site of the Stevens family&#x27;s former estate, as the nation&#x27;s first mechanical engineering college.

By the late 19th century, shipping lines were using Hoboken as a terminal port, and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (later the Erie Lackawanna Railroad) developed a railroad terminal at the waterfront, with the present NJ Transit terminal designed by architect Kenneth Murchison constructed in 1907. It was also during this time that German immigrants, who had been settling in town during most of the century, became the predominant population group in the city, at least partially due to its being a major destination port of the Hamburg America Line, though anti-German sentiment during World War I led to a rapid decline in the German community. In addition to the primary industry of shipbuilding, Hoboken became home to Keuffel and Esser&#x27;s three-story factory and in 1884, to Tietjen and Lang Drydock (later Todd Shipyards). Well-known companies that developed a major presence in Hoboken after the turn-of the-century included Maxwell House, Lipton Tea, and Hostess.

====Birthplace of baseball====
The first officially recorded game of baseball took place in Hoboken in 1846 between Knickerbocker Club and New York Nine at Elysian Fields. In 1845, the Knickerbocker Club, which had been founded by Alexander Cartwright, began using Elysian Fields to play baseball due to the lack of suitable grounds on Manhattan. Team members included players of the St George&#x27;s Cricket Club, the brothers Harry and George Wright, and Henry Chadwick, the English-born journalist who coined the term &quot;America&#x27;s Pastime&quot;.

By the 1850s, several Manhattan-based members of the National Association of Base Ball Players were using the grounds as their home field while St. George&#x27;s continued to organize international matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. In 1859, George Parr&#x27;s All England Eleven of professional cricketers played the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated United States team, a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket should become the national pastime after the game drawing the conclusion that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional players. Harry Wright and George Wright then became two of the first professional baseball players in the United States when Aaron Champion raised funds to found the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1869.

In 1865, the grounds hosted a championship match between the Mutual Club of New York City and the Atlantic Club of Brooklyn that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the Currier &amp; Ives lithograph &quot;The American National Game of Base Ball&quot;.

With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in Brooklyn, enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence of Elysian Fields diminished. In 1868 the leading Manhattan club, Mutual, shifted its home games to the Union Grounds in Brooklyn. In 1880, the founders of the New York Metropolitans and New York Giants finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as the Polo Grounds.

===20th century===

Few nonwhites had settled in Hoboken by 1901. The &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; claimed that an unwritten sundown town policy prevented African Americans from residing or working there.

====World War I====

When the U.S. entered World War I, the Hamburg-American Line piers in Hoboken and New Orleans were taken under eminent domain. Federal control of the port and anti-German sentiment led to part of the city being placed under martial law, and many German immigrants were forcibly moved to Ellis Island or left the city of their own accord. Hoboken became the major point of embarkation and more than three million soldiers, known as &quot;doughboys&quot;, passed through the city. Their hope for an early return led to General Pershing&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Heaven, Hell or Hoboken... by Christmas.&quot;

Following the war, Italians, mostly stemming from the Adriatic port city of Molfetta, became the city&#x27;s major ethnic group, with the Irish also having a strong presence. While the city experienced the Great Depression, jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, and the tenements were bustling. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, also made their way to the city and established small businesses. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which was established on April 30, 1921, oversaw the development of the Holland Tunnel (completed in 1927) and the Lincoln Tunnel (in 1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel between New Jersey and New York City, bypassing the waterfront.

====Post-World War II====
The war facilitated economic growth in Hoboken, as the many industries located in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably, Todd Shipyards), offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial ties chose to stay in town. During the 1950s, the economy was still driven by Todd Shipyards, Maxwell House, Lipton Tea, Hostess and Bethlehem Steel and companies with big plants were still not inclined to invest in major infrastructure elsewhere.
In the 1960s, working pay and conditions began to deteriorate: turn-of-the century housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations shifted to larger facilities on Newark Bay, and the car, truck and plane displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close by ones in Bergen and Passaic Counties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities experiencing the same phenomenon, such as Paterson, Elizabeth, Camden, and neighboring Jersey City.

The old economic underpinnings were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights. Though the city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of immigrants, most notably Puerto Ricans, kept the storefronts open with small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn&#x27;t much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called &quot;the avenue&quot;, was never boarded up, and the tight-knit neighborhoods remained home to many who were still proud of their city. Stevens remained a premier technology school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came back to the &quot;old neighborhood&quot; to shop for delicatessen.

In 1975, the western part of the Keuffel and Esser Manufacturing Complex (known as &quot;Clock Towers&quot;) was converted into residential apartments, after having been an architectural, engineering and drafting facility from 1907 to 1968; the eastern part portion became residential apartments in 1984 (now called the &quot; Grand Adams&quot;).

====Waterfront====
The Hudson Waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production plants of Lipton Tea and Maxwell House, and the drydocks of Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation and Todd Shipbuilding dominated the northern portion for many years. On June 30, 1900, a large fire at the Norddeutscher Lloyd piers killed numerous people and caused almost $10 million in damage. The southern portion (which had been a U.S. base of the Hamburg-American Line) was seized by the federal government under eminent domain at the outbreak of World War I, after which it became (with the rest of the Hudson County) a major East Coast cargo-shipping port.
With the development of the Interstate Highway System and containerization shipping facilities (particularly at Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal), the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned. A large swath of River Street, known as the Barbary Coast for its taverns and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, merchant mariners, and other seamen) was leveled as part of an urban renewal project. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with the Port Authority gave it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, agreements were made with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers to build commercial and residential buildings and &quot;open spaces&quot; (mostly along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilized Pier A).

The northern portion, which had remained in private hands, has also been re-developed. While most of the dry-dock and production facilities were razed to make way for mid-rise apartment houses, many sold as investment condominiums, some buildings were renovated for adaptive re-use (notably the Tea Building, formerly home to Lipton Tea, and the Machine Shop, home of the Hoboken Historic Museum). Zoning requires that new construction follow the street grid and limits the height of new construction to retain the architectural character of the city and open sight-lines to the river. Downtown, Frank Sinatra Park and Sinatra Drive honor the man most consider to be Hoboken&#x27;s most famous son, while uptown the name Maxwell recalls the factory with its smell of roasting coffee wafting over town and its huge neon &quot;Good to the Last Drop&quot; sign, so long a part of the landscape. The midtown section is dominated by the serpentine rock outcropping atop of which sits Stevens Institute of Technology (which also owns some, as yet, undeveloped land on the river). At the foot of the cliff is Sybil&#x27;s Cave (where 19th century day-trippers once came to &quot;take the waters&quot; from a natural spring), long sealed shut, though plans for its restoration are in place. The promenade along the river bank is part of the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway, a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the Bayonne Bridge to George Washington Bridge and provide contiguous unhindered access to the water&#x27;s edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline. As of 2017, the city was considering using eminent domain to take over the last operating maritime industry in the city, the Union Dry Dock.

====1970s–present====
During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-20th-century brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be tenements. Hoboken experienced a wave of fires, some of which were arson. Applied Housing, a real-estate investment firm, used federal government incentives to renovate &quot;sub-standard&quot; housing and receive subsidized rental payments (commonly known as Section 8), which enabled some low-income, displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, upwardly mobile commuters, and &quot;bohemian types&quot; interested in the socioeconomic possibilities and challenges of a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken&#x27;s residential, civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively (compared to Lower Manhattan) less expensive rents, all a quick, train hop away.

These trends in development resembled similar growth and change patterns in Brooklyn and downtown Jersey City and Manhattan&#x27;s East Village—and to a lesser degree, SoHo and TriBeCa—which previously had not been residential. Empty lots were built on, tenements were transformed into luxury condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact of the destruction of the World Trade Center intensely, many of its newer residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy, transit villages are now being promoted. Once a blue collar town characterized by live poultry shops and drab taverns, it has since been transformed into a town filled with gourmet shops and luxury condominiums.

In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused widespread flooding in Hoboken, leaving 1,700 homes flooded and causing $100 million in damage after the storm &quot;filled up Hoboken like a bathtub&quot;, leaving the city without electricity for days, and requiring the summoning of the National Guard. Workers in Hoboken had the highest rate of public transportation use in the nation, with 56% commuting daily via mass transit. Hurricane Sandy caused seawater to flood half the city, crippling the PATH station at Hoboken Terminal when more than 10 million gallons of water dumped into the system. In December 2013 Mayor Dawn Zimmer testified before a U.S. Senate Committee on the impact the storm had on Hoboken&#x27;s businesses and residents, and in January 2014 she stated that Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, a member of governor Chris Christie&#x27;s cabinet, deliberately held back Hurricane Sandy relief funds from the city in order to pressure her to approve a Christie ally&#x27;s developmental project, a charge that the Christie administration denied. In June 2014, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated $230 million to Hoboken as part of its Rebuild by Design initiative, adding levees, parks, green roofs, retention basins and other infrastructure to help the low-lying riverfront city protect itself from ordinary flooding and build a network of features to help Hoboken future-proof itself against subsequent storms.

The project included expanding the city&#x27;s sewer capacity, incorporating cisterns and basins into parks and playgrounds, redesigning streets to minimize traffic accidents, and collect and redirect waster. By September 2023, the improvements were so successful that when a storm hit the area that month, depositing 3.5 inches on the city, including 1.44 inches during the hour coinciding with high tide, only a few inches of standing water remains at three of the city&#x27;s 277 intersections by the evening, resulting in only three towed cars, and no cancelation of any city events. In an article that November for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Michael Kimmelman compared this to the storm&#x27;s effects in New York City, whose government focused on flood walls and breakwaters, but not rainwater, resulting in several subway lines being submerged in water, and thigh-high water levels in Brooklyn streets. For this, the article hailed Hoboken as a &quot;climate change success story.&quot;

The city has been the location of several film productions. Elia Kazan&#x27;s Academy Award-winning 1954 film &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, was shot in Hoboken. A wedding scene in the 1997 Jennifer Aniston film &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; was filmed at the Elks Club at 1005 Washington Street. The 1998 Adrien Brody film &quot;Restaurant&quot; is set in Hoboken. The production company for the 2009 film &quot;Assassination of a High School President&quot; was based in Hoboken. The children&#x27;s book The Hoboken Chicken Emergency takes place in the city.

The city is home to Carlo&#x27;s Bake Shop, which was featured from 2009 to 2020 in the TLC reality show &quot;Cake Boss&quot;. The popularity of the show resulted in increased business for Carlo&#x27;s Bake Shop, and increased tourism to the Hoboken area, although the long lines drove away some of the shop&#x27;s local customers.

The fourth season of A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;Parking Wars&quot;, which documents the lives and duties of parking enforcement personnel, was filmed in Hoboken, in addition to its usual venues of Detroit and Philadelphia. The ABC Primetime magazine &quot;Primetime: What Would You Do?&quot; has filmed multiple episodes of their social experiments in Hoboken&#x27;s shops and restaurants.

The 1989 television series &quot;Dream Street&quot; was set and shot in Hoboken.

Bands from Hoboken include alternative rock pioneers The Bongos and the art-rock band Yo La Tengo.

<text>Jersey City is the second-most populous city in the U.S. state of New Jersey, after Newark. It is the county seat of Hudson County, and is the county&#x27;s most populous city and its largest (by area). As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 292,449, an increase of 44,852 (+18.1%) from the 2010 census count of 247,597, in turn an increase of 7,542 (+3.1%) from the 240,055 enumerated at the 2000 census. The Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 291,657 for 2023, making it the 72nd-most populous municipality in the nation. With more than 40 languages spoken in more than 52% of homes and as of 2020, 42.5% of residents born outside the United States, Jersey City is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world and the most ethnically diverse in the United States.

The third most-populous city in the New York metropolitan area, Jersey City is bounded on the east by the Hudson River and Upper New York Bay and on the west by the Hackensack River and Newark Bay. A port of entry, with of waterfront and extensive rail infrastructure and connectivity, the city is an important transportation terminus and distribution and manufacturing center for the Port of New York and New Jersey with Port Jersey as the city&#x27;s intermodal freight transport facility and container shipping terminal. The Holland Tunnel, PATH rapid transit system, and NY Waterway ferry service connect across the Hudson River with Manhattan.

The area was settled by the Dutch in the 17th century as Pavonia and later established as Bergen; the first permanent settlement, local civil government and oldest municipality in what became the state of New Jersey. The area came under English control in 1664. Jersey City was incorporated in 1838 and annexed Van Vorst Township in 1851. On May 3, 1870, following a special election in 1869 with a majority of county support, Jersey City annexed Bergen City and Hudson City to form &quot;Greater Jersey City&quot; with Greenville joining in 1873. Jersey City grew into a busy port city on New York Harbor by the late 19th and early 20th century. Jersey City&#x27;s official motto, displayed on the city seal and flag, is &quot;Let Jersey Prosper&quot; referencing its 19th century boarder dispute with New York City.

Jersey City is home to several institutions of higher education such as New Jersey City University, Saint Peter&#x27;s University and Hudson County Community College. As the county seat, Jersey City is home to the Hudson County Courthouse and Frank J. Guarini Justice Complex. Cultural venues throughout the city include the Loew&#x27;s Jersey Theatre, White Eagle Hall, the Liberty Science Center, Ellis Island, Mana Contemporary and the Museum of Jersey City History. Large parks in Jersey City are Liberty State Park, Lincoln Park and Berry Lane Park. Redevelopment of the Jersey City waterfront has made the city one of the largest hubs for banking and finance in the United States and has led to the district and city being nicknamed Wall Street West. Since the 1990s, Jersey City has been a destination for artists and hipsters. With the city&#x27;s proximity and connections to Manhattan, its growing arts, culture and nightlife scene and its own finance and tech based economy, apartment rents in the city have grown to become some of the highest in the United States. In response, Jersey City has instituted zoning and legislation to require developers to include affordable housing units in their developments. In 2023, &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; ranked Jersey City as the best place to live in New Jersey.

==History==
===Lenape and New Netherland===

The land that is now Jersey City was inhabited by the Lenape, a collection of Native American tribes (later called Delaware Indian). In 1609, Henry Hudson, seeking an alternate route to East Asia, anchored his small vessel Halve Maen (English: Half Moon) at Sandy Hook, Harsimus Cove and Weehawken Cove, and elsewhere along what was later named the North River. After spending nine days surveying the area and meeting its inhabitants, he sailed as far north as Albany. The contemporary flag of the city is a variation on the Prince&#x27;s Flag from the Netherlands. The stripes are blue, white and yellow, with the center of the flag showing the city seal, depicting Hudson&#x27;s ship, the Half Moon, and other modern vessels.

By 1621, the Dutch West India Company was organized to manage this new territory and in June 1623, New Netherland became a Dutch province, with headquarters in New Amsterdam. Michael Reyniersz Pauw received a land grant as patroon on the condition that he would establish a settlement of not fewer than fifty persons within four years. He chose the west bank of the Hudson River and purchased the land from the Lenape. This grant is dated November 22, 1630, and is the earliest known conveyance for what are now Hoboken and Jersey City. Pauw, however, was an absentee landlord who neglected to populate the area and was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. That year, a house was built at Communipaw for Jan Evertsen Bout, superintendent of the colony, which had been named &quot;Pavonia&quot; (the Latinized form of Pauw&#x27;s name, which means &quot;peacock&quot; or &quot;land of the peacock&quot;). Shortly after, another house was built at Harsimus Cove in 1634 and became the home of Cornelius Henrick Van Vorst, who had succeeded Bout as superintendent, and whose family would become influential in the development of the city. Relations with the Lenape deteriorated, in part because Director-General Willem Kieft attempted to tax and drive out the Lenapes, which led to a series of raids and reprisals and the virtual destruction of the settlement on the west bank. During Kieft&#x27;s War, approximately 120 Lenapes were killed by the Dutch in a massacre ordered by Kieft at Pavonia on the night of February 25, 1643. On May 11, 1647, Peter Stuyvesant arrived in New Amsterdam to replace Kieft as Director-General of New Netherland. On September 15, 1655, Pavonia was attacked as part of a Munsee occupation of New Amsterdam called the Peach War that saw 40 colonists killed and over 100, mostly women and children, taken captive and held at Paulus Hook. They were later ransomed to New Amsterdam.

On January 10, 1658, Stuyvesant &quot;re-purchased&quot; the scattered communities of farmsteads that characterized the Dutch settlements at Pavonia: Communipaw, Harsimus, Paulus Hook, Hoebuck, Awiehaken, Pamrapo, and other lands &quot;behind Kill van Kull&quot;. The village of Bergen (located inside a palisaded garrison) was established by the settlers who wished to return to the west bank of the Hudson on what is now Bergen Square in 1660 and officially chartered by Stuyvesant on September 5, 1661, as the state&#x27;s first local civil government. The village was designed by Jacques Cortelyou, the first surveyor of New Amsterdam. The word &quot;berg&quot; taken from the Dutch means &quot;hill&quot;, while &quot;bergen&quot; means &quot;place of safety&quot;. The charter partially removed Bergen from the jurisdiction of New Amsterdam and put the surrounding settlements under its authority. As a result, it is regarded as the first permanent settlement and oldest municipality in what would become the state of New Jersey. It is also the home of Public School No. 11, the nation&#x27;s longest-continuous school site and the site of the first free and public school building in New Jersey, and Old Bergen Church, the oldest continuous congregation in New Jersey. In addition, the oldest surviving houses in Jersey City are of Dutch origin including the Newkirk House (1690), the Van Vorst Farmhouse (1740), and the Van Wagenen House (1740).

In 1661, Communipaw Ferry began operation as the first ferry service between the village of Communipaw (Jersey City) and New Amsterdam (Manhattan) shortly after the village of Bergen was established.

====Province of New Jersey====
On August 27, 1664, four English frigates sailed into New York Harbor and captured Fort Amsterdam, and by extension, all of New Netherland, a prelude to the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Under the Articles of Capitulation, the Dutch residents of Bergen were allowed to continue their way of life and worship. Later in 1664, James, the Duke of York, granted the land between the Hudson and Delaware River to Sir George Carteret as a debt settlement. Carteret named it &quot;New Jersey&quot; after his homeland the island of Jersey. The Concession and Agreement was issued soon after providing religious freedom and recognition of private property in the colony. In exchange, residents were required to pledge loyalty to their new government.

Following the Treaty of Westminster, New Jersey split into East Jersey and West Jersey. From 1674 to 1702, Bergen was part of East Jersey and became a town in Bergen County on March 7, 1683, one of the four newly independent counties in East Jersey. In 1702, New Jersey was reunified and became a royal colony. Bergen was chosen as the county seat in 1710 and was re-established by royal charter on January 4, 1714.

===18th century===
By the 1760s, Paulus Hook was known for its convenient stagecoach and ferry services. In 1764, Cornelius Van Vorst (1728–1818) established the Paulus Hook Ferry (later called &quot;Jersey City Ferry&quot;) and operated the service from Paulus Hook to Cortland Street. To further attract patrons to his ferry landing, Van Vorst created a mile-long circular horse racing track that attracted tourists from both sides of the Hudson and built the Van Vorst Tavern near Grand and Hudson Streets as a one-story building with a Dutch roof and eaves and an overhanging porch that faced the river. To further ensure the profitability of his business ventures on the small island of Paulus Hook, he created an embankment road above the tidal marshes to the mainland. Ahead of the Revolutionary War, Van Vorst declared himself a patriot and in 1774 was appointed to one of the committees of correspondence, representing Bergen County and attended a meeting in New Brunswick to elect delegates to the Second Continental Congress.

====American Revolution====
In 1776, even before the war, General George Washington ordered American patriots to construct several forts to defend the western banks of the Hudson River, one of which was located at Paulus Hook. The fort was a naturally defensible position that guarded New York from British attack, guarded the Hudson River channel and the gateway to New Jersey. After suffering defeats in New York City, on September 23, 1776, the American patriots abandoned Paulus Hook and the British occupied it. The fort became the first New Jersey territory invaded and occupied by the British.

In mid-summer 1779, a flamboyant 23-year-old Princeton University graduate, Major Henry Lee, recommended to General Washington a daring plan for the Continental Army to attack the fort, in what became known as the Battle of Paulus Hook. The assault was planned to begin shortly after midnight on August 19, 1779. Lee led a force of about 300 men, some of whom got lost during the march through the swampy, marshy land. The attack was late to start but the main contingent of the force was able to reach the fort&#x27;s gate without being challenged. It is believed that the British mistook the approaching force for allied Hessians returning from patrol, though this has not been definitively documented.

The attacking Patriots succeeded in damaging the fort and took 158 British prisoners, but were unable to destroy the fort and spike its cannons. As daytime arrived, Lee decided that prudent action demanded that the Patriots withdraw before the British forces from New York could cross the river. Paulus Hook remained in British hands until after the war but the battle was a small strategic victory for the forces of independence as it forced the British to abandon their plans for taking rebel positions in the New York area.

Later that August, General Washington met with the Marquis de Lafayette in the village of Bergen to discuss war strategy over lunch and to bait the British into attacking Bergen from New York. The meeting purportedly took place at the Van Wagenen House on Academy Street. Additionally, a nearby &quot;point of rocks&quot; at the east end of the street provided an ideal vantage point for military surveillance of the Hudson River.

One day in September 1780, a local Bergen farmer, Jane Tuers, was selling her goods in British-occupied Manhattan when she stopped in Fraunces Tavern and spoke with the owner, Samuel Fraunces. He informed Tuers that British soldiers were in his tavern toasting General Benedict Arnold, who was to deliver West Point to the British. Tuers returned to Bergen later that day and informed her brother Daniel Van Reypen about the conspiracy. Van Reypen rode to Hackensack to meet with General Anthony Wayne who then sent Van Reypen to inform General Washington of the conspiracy. The information provided by Tuers confirmed what Washington had suspected of Arnold and led to the arrest, trial, conviction and hanging of co-conspirator John André for treason and stopped the plot to surrender West Point. Arnold would later defect to the British to escape prosecution.

On November 22, 1783, the British evacuated Paulus Hook and sailed home three days before they left New York on Evacuation Day. While these events occupy only a small portion of U.S. Revolutionary War history, they are important parts of the history of New Jersey and New Jersey&#x27;s role in the American Revolution and hold an even more important place in the history of the local neighborhoods. In 1903, a obelisk was erected at Paulus Hook Park at the intersection of Washington and Grand Streets, the site of the fort, to memorialize the Battle of Paulus Hook. In 1924, a plaque honoring Jane Tuer&#x27;s heroism was installed at the site of her former home now Hudson Catholic Regional High School. In 2021, the restored Van Wagenen House was re-opened as the Museum of Jersey City History.

On February 21, 1798, Bergen became a township by the New Jersey Legislature&#x27;s Township Act of 1798 as the first group of 104 townships in New Jersey.

===19th century===
In 1804, Alexander Hamilton, now a private citizen, was focused on increasing manufacturing in the greater New York City area. To that end, he helped to create the &quot;Associates of the Jersey Company&quot; which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. While envisioning the future of Jersey City, Hamilton said: &quot;One day, a great city shall rise on the western banks of the Hudson River.&quot; The consortium of 35 investors behind the company were predominantly Federalists who, like Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by Thomas Jefferson and other Democratic-Republicans. Large tracts of land in Paulus Hook were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Anthony Dey, who was from a prominent old Dutch family, and his two cousins, Colonel Richard Varick, the former mayor of New York City (1789–1801), and Jacob Radcliff, a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810 to 1811 and again from 1815 to 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in Lower Manhattan or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them). John B. Coles, a former New York State senator (1799–1802), purchased the area north of Paulus Hook known as Harsimus and laid out a grid plan centered around a park. Following Hamilton&#x27;s death, Coles proposed naming the park in his honor as &quot;Hamilton Park&quot;.

Despite Hamilton&#x27;s untimely death in July 1804, the Association carried on with the New Jersey Legislature approving Hamilton&#x27;s charter of incorporation on November 10, 1804. However, the enterprise was mired in a legal boundary dispute between New York City and the state of New Jersey over who owned the waterfront. This along with the associated press coverage discouraged investors who wanted lots on the waterfront for commercial purposes. The unresolved dispute would continue until the Treaty of 1834 where New York City formally ceded control of the Jersey City waterfront to New Jersey. Over that time though, the Jersey Company opened the city&#x27;s first hospital, known as the &quot;pest house&quot;, in 1808 and applied to the New Jersey Legislature to incorporate the &quot;Town of Jersey&quot; in 1819. The legislature enacted &quot;An Act to incorporate the City of Jersey, in the County of Bergen&quot; on January 28, 1820. Under the provision, five freeholders (including Varick, Dey, and Radcliff) were to be chosen as &quot;the Board of Selectmen of Jersey City&quot;, thereby establishing the first governing body of the emerging municipality. The city was reincorporated on January 23, 1829, and again on February 22, 1838, at which time it became completely independent of Bergen and was given its present name. On February 22, 1840, it became part of the newly created Hudson County.
In 1812, Robert Fulton began steam ferry service via the &quot;The Jersey&quot; between Paulus Hook and Manhattan eight years after building a shipyard at Greene and Morgan Streets. In 1834, the New Jersey Rail Road and Transportation Company opened the city&#x27;s first rail line from Jersey City Ferry to Newark. From 1834 to 1836, the Morris Canal was extended to Jersey City and New York Harbor linking the Delaware River with the Hudson River. This extension connected Jersey City to Pennsylvania&#x27;s Lehigh Valley and New Jersey&#x27;s interior providing a steady and easy supply of coal and anthracite pig iron for the growing iron industry and other developing industries adopting steam power in Jersey City and the region.

In 1839, Provident Savings Institution was charted by the state as the first mutual savings bank in New Jersey and the first bank in Jersey City and Hudson County. Co-founded by the city&#x27;s first mayor, Dudley S. Gregory (1838–1840), in the wake of the Panic of 1837, there was a general mistrust of banks by the public. In response, the bank&#x27;s charter established it as a &quot;mutual savings bank&quot; to assist the city&#x27;s immigrant poor. In 1901, the bank headquarters was the temporary home of the first branch of the Jersey City Free Public Library.

On April 12, 1841, the New Jersey Legislature incorporated Van Vorst Township from portions of Bergen. Land was donated by the Van Vorst family for a town square style park that became Van Vorst Park. The township was later annexed by Jersey City on March 18, 1851. From 1854 to 1874, the kitchen step of the Van Vorst Mansion, home of former mayor Cornelius Van Vorst (1860–1862), was known to be the slab of marble that was originally the base of the statue of King George III that was toppled by the Sons of Liberty at Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan in 1776. Van Vorst also constructed the neighboring Barrow Mansion where his sister Eliza lived.

By mid century, Jersey City&#x27;s rapidly urbanizing population began to encounter significant challenges gaining access to freshwater. In 1850, Jersey City Water Works engineer William S. Whitwell, proposed a three-reservoir complex in the Jersey City Heights (then part of North Bergen) connected to a pumping station near the Passaic River in Belleville by a massive underground aqueduct to deliver freshwater to the city. Reservoir No. 1 was built between 1851–1854 and Reservoir No. 3 was built between 1871 and 1874 under the direction of engineer John Culver. Reservoir No. 2 was never constructed and later became Pershing Field.
During the 19th century, former slaves reached Jersey City on one of the four main routes of the Underground Railroad that all converged in the city. On Bergen Hill, the Hilton-Holden House, named after noted abolitionist and astronomer David Le Cain Holden, was a &quot;station&quot; for fugitive slaves to stop over and seek refuge and is one of the last remaining in Jersey City. Slaves would then be hidden in wagons en route to the Jersey City waterfront and Morris Canal Basin where abolitionists would hire ferry and coal boats to transport former slaves up to Canada or New England to freedom.

In 1868, the Jersey City Board of Alderman took over the pest house and renamed it &quot;Jersey City Charity Hospital&quot; and operated it as a public medical facility where physicians provided free medical care to city residents. In 1885, the hospital expanded to a new 200-bed facility on Bergen Hill to remove the hospital from the increasing industrial development at Paulus Hook.

====Consolidation of Jersey City====
Soon after the Civil War, the idea arose of uniting all of the towns of Hudson County east of the Hackensack River into one municipality. A bill was approved by the state legislature on April 2, 1869, with a special election to be held on October 5, 1869. An element of the bill provide that only contiguous towns could be consolidated. While a majority of the voters across the county approved the merger, the only municipalities that had approved the consolidation plan and that adjoined Jersey City were Hudson City and Bergen City. The consolidation began on March 17, 1870, taking effect on May 3, 1870. Three years later the present outline of Jersey City was completed when Greenville agreed to merge into the Greater Jersey City.

Following consolidation, the city&#x27;s first university, Saint Peter&#x27;s College, was charted in 1872 and classes began on September 2, 1878, in Paulus Hook. Decades later, it would adopt the peacock as its mascot in partial reference to the original settling of the Jersey City area as &quot;Pavonia&quot;.

On October 28, 1886, the Statue of Liberty was dedicated by President Grover Cleveland just off the city&#x27;s shores at Bedloe&#x27;s Island in New York Harbor. The statue would welcome millions of immigrants as they arrived by ship at Ellis Island (opened in 1892) in the coming decades.

By the late 1880s, three passenger railroad terminals opened in Jersey City along the Hudson River (Pavonia Terminal, Exchange Place and Communipaw) making Jersey City a terminus for the nation&#x27;s rail network. Tens of millions, roughly two-thirds, of immigrants that were processed at Ellis Island entered the United States through Communipaw Terminal as they made their way westward. The railroads transformed the geography of the city by building several tunnels and cuts, such as the Bergen Arches, through the city and filling in the coves at Harsimus and Communipaw for the construction of several large freight rail yards along the waterfront.

Jersey City became an important port, railroad and manufacturing city during the 19th and 20th centuries. Much like New York City, Jersey City has always been a destination for new immigrants to the United States. German, Russian, Polish, Scottish, Irish and Italian immigrants settled in local tenements and found work at the local docks, railroads and adjacent companies such as American Can, Colgate, Chloro, Lorillard Tobacoo and Dixon Ticonderoga. During this time, concern grew for the social issues of the city&#x27;s immigrant poor. Cornelia Foster Bradford founded Whittier House in Paulus Hook in 1894 as the first &quot;settlement house&quot; in New Jersey. Whittier House led to several social reforms and city &quot;firsts&quot; such as free kindergarten, a dental clinic, a visiting nurse service, a milk and medical dispensary, diet kitchen for mothers and babies and a playground. Mary Buell Sayles, a settlement resident, wrote the &quot;The Housing Conditions of Jersey City&quot; in 1902 about the lives of immigrants in and around Paulus Hook. In response, mayor Mark M. Fagan (1902–1907) created the Municipal Sanitary League and opened the city&#x27;s first public bath house on Coles Street in 1904. That same year, the first &quot;State Tenement House Commission&quot; was formed and the New Jersey Legislature passed the &quot;Tenement House Act&quot;.

===20th century===

By the turn of the 20th century, the City Beautiful movement had spread throughout cities in the United States. Part of its mission was to preserve public space for recreational activities in urban industrial communities. The Hudson County Parks Commission was created in 1892 to plan and develop a county wide park and boulevard system similar to those found in other cities. From 1892 to 1897, Hudson Boulevard (now John F. Kennedy Boulevard) was built to connect the future park system from Bayonne to North Bergen through Jersey City. In 1905, Lincoln Park opened on the city&#x27;s West Side as the largest park in Jersey City and the first and largest park in the county system. Designed by Daniel W. Langton and Charles N. Lowrie, the park was mostly built on undeveloped wetlands and woodlands known as &quot;Glendale Woods&quot; stretching from the Boulevard to the Hackensack River. The Jersey City government was also inspired by the City Beautiful movement to build more open space creating Dr. Leonard J. Gordon Park in the Heights along Hudson Boulevard, Mary Benson Park in Downtown and Bayside Park in Greenville. The movement also inspired the construction of grand civic buildings in the city such as City Hall and the Hudson County Courthouse.

In 1908, the city&#x27;s water supply was the first permanent chlorinated disinfection system for drinking water in the United States. Devised by John L. Leal and designed by George W. Fuller, the system was installed at the city&#x27;s new Boonton Reservoir which replaced the Passaic River as the city&#x27;s freshwater source in 1904. The Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad (now the PATH system) opened between 1908 and 1913 as New Jersey&#x27;s first underground rapid transit system. For the first time, Jersey City and the rail terminals at Hoboken, Pavonia and Exchange Place were directly linked with Midtown and Lower Manhattan under the Hudson River providing an alternative to transferring to the extensive ferry system.

In 1910, William L. Dickinson High School opened as the first purpose built high school in Jersey City. Built during the City Beautiful movement, the design of the school is thought to be inspired by the Louvre Colonnade and Buckingham Palace. The prominent hilltop location of the school has been an important location throughout the city&#x27;s history. During the Revolutionary War, it was used as a lookout by General Washington and Marquis de Lafayette to observe British movements at the forts at Paulus Hook and in Lower Manhattan. After the start of the War of 1812, the site assisted in defending New York Harbor with an arsenal built on the property&#x27;s west side and the east side serving as a troop campground. During the Civil War, the arsenal served as barracks for Union soldiers and a hospital. The school was used as an army training facility during World War I and World War II.

On July 30, 1916, the Black Tom explosion occurred killing 7 people, damaged the Statue of Liberty and caused millions of dollars in damages in Jersey City and throughout the New York metropolitan area. The explosion was an act of sabotage on American munitions by German spies of the Office of Naval Intelligence to prevent the ammunition from being shipped to the Allies for use during World War I. This event, coupled with the torpedoing of the RMS Lusitania that killed 136 Americans in 1915, pushed the United States into entering the War in 1917.

====Mayor &quot;Boss&quot; Hague====

From 1917 to 1947, Jersey City was governed by Mayor Frank Hague. Originally elected as a candidate supporting reform in governance, the Jersey City History website says his name is &quot;synonymous with the early twentieth century urban American blend of political favoritism and social welfare known as bossism&quot;. Hague ran the city with an iron fist while, at the same time, molding governors, United States senators, and judges to his whims while also being a close political ally to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Boss Hague was known to be loud and vulgar, but dressed in a stylish manner, earning him the nickname &quot;King Hanky-Panky&quot;. In his later years in office, Hague would often dismiss his enemies as &quot;reds&quot; or &quot;commies&quot;. Hague lived like a millionaire, despite having an annual salary that never exceeded $8,500. He was able to maintain a fourteen-room duplex apartment in Jersey City, a suite at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, and a palatial summer home in the seaside community of Deal, and travel to Europe yearly in the royal suites of the best ocean liners.

Hague&#x27;s time as mayor was also marked by his direct influence in the construction of several important infrastructure, educational, open space, healthcare and public works projects that became functional civic landmarks that define the city to this day. Some of these projects are the construction of Journal Square and its theaters, the Holland Tunnel, the Wittpenn Bridge, the design of New Jersey Route 139, the Pulaski Skyway, Lincoln High School, Snyder High School, A. Harry Moore School, New Jersey City University, the Heights, Miller and Greenville branches of the library system, Pershing Field, Audubon Park, five public housing complexes, Harborside Terminal, the Seventh Police Precinct and Criminal Court, the expansion of Jersey City Hospital to Jersey City Medical Center, the Jersey City Armory and Roosevelt Stadium. Hague financed several of these projects with WPA funds secured by congresswoman Mary Teresa Norton (1925–1951), 
the first woman elected to represent New Jersey or any state in the Northeast.

After Hague&#x27;s retirement from politics, a series of mayors including John V. Kenny, Thomas J. Whelan and Thomas F. X. Smith attempted to take control of Hague&#x27;s organization, usually under the mantle of political reform. None were able to duplicate the level of power held by Hague, but the city and Hudson County remained notorious for political corruption for decades.

====Post-World War II====
Following World War II, returning veterans created a post-war economic boom and were beginning to buy homes in the suburbs with the assistance of the G.I. Bill. During the Great Depression and the war years, not much new housing was constructed leaving cities with older and overcrowded housing stock. In response, Jersey City looked to build new housing on undeveloped tracts around the city. College Towers was built on the West Side as the first middle-income housing cooperative apartment complex in New Jersey in 1956. Country Village was built in the 1960s as a middle-income &quot;suburbia-in-the-city&quot; planned community in the Greenville/West Side area to offer the &quot;out of town&quot; experience without leaving the city. The city had hoped that new residential neighborhoods and housing stock would keep the city&#x27;s population stable.

From 1956 to 1968, Jersey City Medical Center was the home of the Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry, the predecessor to the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) which would relocate to Newark in 1969.

In 1956, the Newark Bay (Hudson County) Extension (I-78) of the New Jersey Turnpike opened. As the first limited-access section of I-78 to be built in the state, the extension connected Jersey City and the Holland Tunnel to the mainline of the Turnpike via the Newark Bay Bridge and at an estimated cost of $2,765 per foot, it was deemed the &quot;world&#x27;s most expensive road&quot;. That same year, the standard shipping container debuted along with the maiden voyage of the container ship SS Ideal X from Port Newark to the Port of Houston. These innovations changed the way the maritime industry shipped goods by sea forever and led to the transformation of Port Newark into the leading container port in New York Harbor. As a result, the Jersey City waterfront, along with the other traditional waterfront port facilities in the harbor, quickly became antiquated and fell into a steep decline. Additionally, by the late 1960s, the former rail terminals and associated ferry service that were so vital to the city&#x27;s economic health had closed and were later abandoned after the former railroads declared bankruptcy. In response to adapt to this economic shift, Port Jersey was created on Upper New York Bay adjacent to Greenville Yard between 1972 and 1976 as the city&#x27;s own modern intermodal freight transport facility and container shipping terminal.

By the 1970s the city experienced a period of urban decline spurred on by deindustrialization that saw many of its wealthy residents leave for the suburbs, due to rising crime, civil unrest, political corruption, and economic hardship. From 1950 to 1980, Jersey City lost 75,000 residents, and from 1975 to 1982, the city lost 5,000 jobs, or 9% of its workforce.

On Flag Day 1976, Liberty State Park opened on New York Harbor to coincide with the nation&#x27;s bicentennial. At with a two-mile waterfront walkway, it is the largest park in Jersey City and the largest urban park in New Jersey. The park was built on the site of the former railyards of the Central Railroad of New Jersey and Lehigh Valley Railroad. The idea for the park dated back to the late 1950s and its creation was advocated for and spearheaded by several Jersey City residents; Audrey Zapp, Theodore Conrad, Morris Pesin and J. Owen Grundy. Jersey City donated of land to the development of the park through their advocacy. The Liberty Science Center opened in the park in 1993.

===Late 20th and early 21st centuries===
Beginning in the 1980s, the restoration of brownstones in neighborhoods such as Paulus Hook, Van Vorst Park, Hamilton Park, Harsimus Cove and Bergen Hill along with the development of the waterfront previously occupied by railyards, factories and warehouses helped to stir the beginnings of an economic renaissance for Jersey City. The rapid construction of numerous high-rise buildings, such as the mixed-use community of Newport, increased the population and led to the development of the Exchange Place financial district, also known as &quot;Wall Street West&quot;, one of the largest financial centers in the United States. Large financial institutions such as UBS, Goldman Sachs, Chase Bank, Citibank, and Merrill Lynch occupy prominent buildings on the Jersey City waterfront, some of which are among the tallest buildings in New Jersey. With of office space as of 2011, Jersey City has the nation&#x27;s 12th-largest downtown and the state&#x27;s largest office market. Since 1988, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection  has mandated by law that developers building along the waterfront preserve and develop the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway to provide the public with access and recreation by creating a linear park along the Hudson River.

Simultaneous to this building boom, new transit projects were prioritized. By the late 1980s, trans-Hudson ferry service was restored along the waterfront by NY Waterway with ferry terminals at Paulus Hook and Newport. From 1996 to 2011, NJ Transit constructed the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail as one of the largest public works projects in state history. The system was developed and extended throughout the city and its Downtown utilizing the former right-of-ways of the railroads that defined the city and county during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The system links Jersey City with its neighboring cities while connecting to several NJ Transit bus lines, PATH stations and ferry terminals.

====September 11, 2001====
Jersey City was directly affected by the September 11, 2001 attacks at the World Trade Center where 38 city residents lost their lives. One of the 38 victims was Joseph Lovero, a Jersey City Fire Department dispatcher, who was killed by a piece of falling debris while responding. The Jersey City Fire Department was the only New Jersey fire department to receive an official call for assistance from the New York City Fire Department that day. Following the attacks, the Jersey City waterfront became the largest triage center in the area for survivors escaping Lower Manhattan by ferry during the &quot;9/11 Boatlift&quot;. In the days and weeks after, Jersey City became a staging area for rescue and aid workers headed to &quot;Ground Zero&quot; for rescue and recovery efforts. The collapse of the Twin Towers destroyed the World Trade Center PATH station and the firefighting efforts flooded the Downtown Hudson River tunnels and the Exchange Place PATH station severing the rail connection between Jersey City and Lower Manhattan until 2003. Over the years several memorials have been erected along the waterfront including the &quot;Jersey City 9/11 Memorial&quot; and the official New Jersey state memorial &quot;Empty Sky&quot;. On November 19, 2015, while campaigning for president in Birmingham, Alabama, Donald Trump falsely claimed a conspiracy theory that he witnessed people celebrating the attacks in Jersey City on television. Trump said: 
Trump continued to repeat the conspiracy theory to multiple news outlets for weeks despite no confirmed reports, evidence or footage from that time being found to confirm his repeated falsehood.

====2010s–present====
Jersey City was heavily impacted by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 with extended power outages for multiple days, severe wind damage in several neighborhoods and extensive flooding throughout Downtown Jersey City, the Country Village neighborhood, the city&#x27;s West Side and Liberty State Park. The flooding damaged the city&#x27;s utility infrastructure and led to a days long shutdown of the PATH system, both of its Hudson River tunnels and the Holland Tunnel.

In October 2013, City Ordinance 13.097 passed requiring employers with ten or more employees to offer up to five paid sick days a year. The bill impacts an estimated 30,000 workers at all businesses who employ workers who work at least 80 hours a calendar year in Jersey City. The passage of the ordinance made Jersey City the first municipality in New Jersey and the sixth in the United States to guarantee paid sick leave.

From 2018 to 2023, Jersey City built a new municipal complex called Jackson Square in the Jackson Hill section of the Bergen-Lafayette neighborhood. Planned since 2014, the city had previously rented office space throughout the city for its multiple agencies. The complex is made up of a City Hall Annex for several agencies, parking garage and public safety headquarters for the Jersey City Police and Fire Departments.

==Geography==
Jersey City is the seat of Hudson County and the second-most-populous city in New Jersey. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 21.13 square miles (54.74 km2), including 14.74 square miles (38.19 km2) of land and 6.39 square miles (16.55 km2) of water (30.24%). As of the 1990 census, it had the smallest land area of the 100 most populous cities in the United States.

Jersey City is bordered to the east by the Hudson River, to the north by Secaucus, North Bergen, Union City and Hoboken, to the west, across the Hackensack River, by Kearny and Newark, and to the south by Bayonne.

Jersey City includes most of Ellis Island (the parts awarded to New Jersey by the 1998 U.S. Supreme Court in the case of &quot;New Jersey v. New York&quot;). Liberty Island is surrounded by Jersey City waters in the Upper New York Bay. Given its proximity and various rapid transit connections to Manhattan, Jersey City (along with Hudson County as a whole) is sometimes referred to as New York City&#x27;s sixth borough.

Jersey City (and most of Hudson County) is located on the peninsula known as Bergen Neck, with a waterfront on the east at the Hudson River and New York Bay and on the west at the Hackensack River and Newark Bay. Its north–south axis corresponds with the ridge of Bergen Hill, the emergence of the Hudson Palisades. The city is the site of some of the earliest European settlements in North America, which grew into each other rather than expanding from a central point. This growth and the topography greatly influenced the development of the sections of the city and its various neighborhoods.

===Neighborhoods===
The city is divided into six wards.

====Bergen-Lafayette====
Bergen-Lafayette, formerly Bergen City, New Jersey, lies between Greenville to the south and McGinley Square to the north, while bordering Liberty State Park and Downtown to the east and the West Side neighborhood to the west. Communipaw Avenue, Bergen Avenue, Martin Luther King Drive, and Ocean Avenue are main thoroughfares. The former Jersey City Medical Center complex, a cluster of Art Deco buildings on a rise in the center of the city, has been converted into residential complexes called The Beacon. Completed in 2016 at a cost of $38 million, (~$ in ) Berry Lane Park is located along Garfield Avenue in the northern section of Bergen-Lafayette; covering , it is the largest municipal park in Jersey City. The Jersey City Municipal Complex opened in phases at Jackson Square in the Jackson Hill neighborhood from 2018 to 2023.

====Downtown Jersey City====
Downtown Jersey City is the area from the Hudson River westward to the Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 78) and the New Jersey Palisades; it is also bounded by Hoboken to the north and Liberty State Park to the south.

Historic Downtown is an area of mostly low-rise buildings to the west of the waterfront that is highly desirable due to its proximity to local amenities and Manhattan. It includes the neighborhoods of Van Vorst Park and Hamilton Park, which are both square parks surrounded by brownstones. This historic downtown also includes Paulus Hook, the Village and Harsimus Cove neighborhoods. Newark Avenue &amp; Grove Street, are the main thoroughfares in Downtown Jersey City, both have seen a lot of development and the surrounding neighborhoods have many stores and restaurants. The Grove Street PATH station is in the process of being renovated and a number of new residential buildings are being built around the stop, including a proposed 50-story building at 90 Columbus. Historic Downtown is home to many cultural attractions including the Jersey City Museum, the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse (planned to become a museum and artist housing) and the Harsimus Stem Embankment along Sixth Street, which a citizens&#x27; movement is working to turn into public parkland that would be modeled after the High Line in Manhattan.

Newport and Exchange Place are redeveloped waterfront areas consisting mostly of residential towers, hotels and office buildings that are among the tallest buildings in the city. Newport is a planned mixed-use community, built on the old Erie Lackawanna Railway yards, made up of residential rental towers, condominiums, office buildings, a marina, schools, restaurants, hotels, Newport Centre Mall, a waterfront walkway, transportation facilities, and on-site parking for more than 15,000 vehicles. Newport had a hand in the renaissance of Jersey City although, before ground was broken, much of the downtown area had already begun a steady climb (much like Hoboken).

====The Heights====

The Heights or Jersey City Heights is a district in the north end of Jersey City atop the New Jersey Palisades overlooking Hoboken to the east and Croxton in the Meadowlands to the west. Previously the city of Hudson City, The Heights was incorporated into Jersey City in 1869. The southern border of The Heights is generally considered to be north of Bergen Arches and the Depressed Highway, while Paterson Plank Road in Washington Park is its main northern boundary. Transfer Station is just over the city line. Its postal area ZIP Code is 07307. The Heights mostly contains two- and three-family houses and low rise apartment buildings, and is similar to North Hudson architectural style and neighborhood character.

==== Journal Square ====
Journal Square is a mixed-use central business district. The square was created in 1923, creating a broad intersection with Hudson Boulevard which itself had been widened in 1908. Other major squares in the neighborhood are Bergen Square, India Square and Five Corners. McGinley Square is located in close proximity to Journal Square, and is considered an extension of it. Journal Square is currently undergoing a massive wave of economic growth and development not seen since the neighborhood was first established with more than 4,400 residential units under construction.

==== Greenville ====
Greenville is on the south end of Jersey City. In the 2010s, the neighborhood underwent a revitalization. Considered an affordable neighborhood in the New York City area, a number of Ultra-Orthodox Jews and young families purchased homes and built a substantial community there, attracted by housing that costs less than half of comparable homes in New York City. In a December 2019 shooting incident, three bystanders were killed in a kosher market in Greenville. The two assailants, who had earlier killed a police detective, were also shot and killed.

==== West Side ====
The West Side borders Greenville to the south and the Hackensack River to the west; it is also bounded to the east and north by Bergen-Lafayette and the broader Journal Square area, including McGinley Square. It consists of various diverse areas on both sides of West Side Avenue, one of Jersey City&#x27;s leading shopping streets. The West Side is the home of New Jersey City University and Saint Peter&#x27;s University.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally cool to cold winters with moderate snowfall. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Jersey City has a humid subtropical climate (closely bordering on a humid continental climate), similar to its parallel cities like Newark and New York City.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 census, Jersey City had a population of 292,449, and a population density of an increase of 44,852 residents (18.1%) from its 2010 census population of 247,597. Since it was believed the earlier population was under-counted, the 2010 census was anticipated with the possibility that Jersey City might become the state&#x27;s most populated city, surpassing Newark. The city hired an outside firm to contest the results, citing the fact that development in the city between 2000 and 2010 substantially increased the number of housing units and that new populations may have been under-counted by as many as 30,000 residents based on the city&#x27;s calculations. Preliminary findings indicated that 19,000 housing units went uncounted.

Per the American Community Survey&#x27;s 2014–2018 estimates, Jersey City&#x27;s age distribution was 7.7% of the population under 5, 13.2% between 6–18, 69% – from 19 to 64, and 10.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age 34.2 years. Females made up 50.8% of the population and there were 100.1 males per 100 females. 86.5% of the population graduated high school, while 44.9% of the population had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. 7.1% of residents under 65 were disabled, while 15.9% of residents live without health insurance.

There were 110,801 housing units and 102,353 households in 2018. The average household size was 2.57. The average per capita income was $36,453, and the median household income was $62,739. 18.7% of residents lived below the poverty line. 67.9% of residents 16+ were within the civilian labor force. The mean travel time to work for residents was 36.8 minutes. 28.6% of housing units are owner-occupied, with the median value of the homes being $344,200. The median gross rent in the city was $1,271.

From 2005 to 2023, Jersey City led New Jersey and the Northeastern United States in housing construction with a 43% increase producing twice as much housing as the rest of the state and 16.7% more than the United States average. Additionally, the city&#x27;s population increased by 18% with a 20% increase in housing units resulting in housing development surpassing population growth. During this time, the median household income in Jersey City grew by 133%, the fourth-highest increase in the Untied States with the median home price increasing by 86%. Over this time, Jersey City has matched or surpassed the number of housing units created in Manhattan in a given year.

=== Race and ethnicity ===

Jersey City has been called &quot;one of the most diverse cities in the world&quot; and for several straight years has been ranked as &quot;the most ethnically diverse city in the United States&quot;. The city is a major port of entry for immigration to the United States and a major employment center at the approximate core of the New York City metropolitan area; and given its proximity to Manhattan, Jersey City has evolved a globally cosmopolitan ambiance of its own, demonstrating a robust and growing demographic and cultural diversity concerning metrics including &quot;nationality, religion, race, and domiciliary partnership.&quot;

In response to the city&#x27;s growing diversity, Jersey City has undertaken several measures to engage its different immigrant communities. In 2017, Jersey City designated itself a &quot;sanctuary city&quot;. In 2018, Jersey City created the Division of Immigrant Affairs within the Department of Health and Human Services. The office works to address the concerns of immigrant communities and build partnerships with nonprofit organizations that serve them specifically in health and human services, immigration legal services, education and English language acquisition, job training, enrollment in public benefits and civic engagement. In 2020, Jersey City became the first municipality in the United States accredited for offering free legal services to immigrants as part of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) Recognition and Accreditation Program. Additionally, The New American Economy (NAE) Research Award named Jersey City to receive NAE research to further address socioeconomic disparities within immigrant populations.

<doc id="125239" wikidata="Q776648" url="?curid=125239" title="Kearny, New Jersey">
<text>Kearny ( ) is a town in the western part of Hudson County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and a suburb of Newark. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 41,999, an increase of 1,315 (+3.2%) from the 2010 census count of 40,684, which in turn reflected an increase of 171 (+0.4%) from the 40,513 counted in the 2000 census.

Kearny is named after Civil War general Philip Kearny. It began as a township formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1867, from portions of Harrison Township. Portions of the township were taken on July 3, 1895, to form East Newark. Kearny was incorporated as a town on January 19, 1899, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier. The Arlington section of town was named for Arlington Station on the Erie Railroad at the Arlington Mill plant, owned by Arlington Mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts.

==History==

===Colonial roots===
The area of Kearny Township, created in 1867, had been part of the original Crown Grant of obtained by Major William Sandford of Barbados on July 4, 1668. Major Sandford named it New Barbadoes Neck after his old home. As was the custom of the time, the Major paid 20 pounds sterling to Chief Tantaqua of the Hackensack tribe for all their reserve rights and titles.

Sanford&#x27;s Uncle, Major Nathaniel Kingsland acquired the property in 1708 and sold the upper western tract of the Grant for 300 pounds sterling to Captain Arent Schuyler two years later. The new purchase included present-day Kearny, North Arlington, Lyndhurst and Kingsland.

Shortly after Schuyler&#x27;s purchase of his new homestead, a peculiar green stone was uncovered. It was sent to England for analysis and he learned that it contained 80% copper. His opening of a copper mine brought the first steam engine to America from England; it was used to pump out the deep mine shaft. The engine was secretly delivered by its engineer, Josiah Hornblower. The engine and mines were destroyed by fire in 1772 and remained idle for some years.

Schuyler Mansion played a role during the American Revolutionary War Era. When Lord Howe of England took possession of New York Harbor, the proximity of Schuyler Mansion drew many of his officers. They generally traveled over a road that today is referred to as the Belleville Turnpike, which was originally constructed in 1759 using cedar logs from the nearby swamps.

During September 1777, General Henry Clinton, head of the British Expeditionary Forces in America, selected Schuyler Mansion for his headquarters during one of his more important raiding operations, which included the famed Battle of Second River. The Mansion stood until 1924, a period of 214 years, when it was torn-down by a land development company, despite the company&#x27;s offers to transfer the land to an organization that would be able to pay to maintain the property.

===19th century===

In the middle 19th century, Kearny was the upper, or northern, section of the Township of Harrison. A prominent citizen and resident of the upper section, General N. M. Halsted, felt it was impossible under these political conditions for his section to obtain proper recognition. He engaged an energetic campaign for an independent township. He succeeded when the NJ Legislature of 1867 on March 14, adopted &quot;an act creating the Township of Kearny&quot;. The town was named to honor Major General Philip Kearny, Commander of the New Jersey Forces in the Civil War and the owner of the mansion known as &quot;Belle Grove&quot; (or &quot;Belgrove&quot;), locally called &quot;Kearny Castle&quot;.

On April 8, 1867, the first election of town officers was held. General N. M. Halsted was elected Chairman. The first official seat of Government was three rooms in the old Lodi Hotel, on the northeast corner of Schuyler and Harrison Avenues.

In the early 1870s, Kearny erected its first Town Hall, on the corner of Kearny and Woodland Avenues, the present site of the Knox Presbyterian Church Parish Hall. This served as a Town Hall, Court House, and Schoolhouse. The Minute Book of the Township states on August 16, 1870, the first step toward establishing Kearny&#x27;s present public school system was taken. The first schoolhouse was housed in the Town Hall built at Kearny and Woodland Avenues in 1873.
The Highland Hose No. 4 firehouse, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1895.

The town&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Soccer Town, U.S.A.&quot; is derived from a soccer tradition that originated in the mid-1870s, when thousands of Scottish and Irish immigrants settled in the town, after two Scottish companies, Clark Thread Company and Nairn Linoleum, opened two local mills and a factory.

When the town&#x27;s growth demanded larger quarters, the present Kearny Town Hall, built of Indiana limestone, was erected in 1909.

===Factory town===
The early influx and development of industry in Kearny dates back to 1875 when the Clark Thread Company of Paisley in Scotland extended its activities to the United States by erecting two large mills in Kearny, and adding two others in 1890. These mills brought to Kearny thousands of Scots immigrants. Many of them would play on Kearny&#x27;s soccer teams in National Association Football League. Many are buried at Arlington Memorial Park in the Kearny Uplands.

In 1876, the Mile End Thread Mills started operating, giving employment to several hundred operators.

In 1883, the Marshall Flax Spinning Company of England erected a large plant in Kearny, known as the Linen Thread Company. Their need for experienced flax spinners brought an influx of workers from other sections of the British Isles. Families of those early textile workers were the nucleus of Kearny&#x27;s present population.

The Puraline Manufacturing Company, later called the Arlington Company, which became a subsidiary of E. I. DuPont de Nemours Company, had purchased a large tract of land east of the Arlington Station on the Erie Railroad extending well out, north of the railroad embankment, into the meadowland.

In 1887, Sir Michael Nairn established the Nairn Linoleum Company of Kirkcaldy in Scotland, now the Congoleum Nairn Company of Kearny, giving further impetus to local industrial growth. This also led to the growth in the Scottish American population which in the 1960s was about 21,000, accounting for more than half of the town&#x27;s residents.

In 1902, the Lovell–Dressel Company, manufacturers of marine and railway lamps and fixtures, located in Kearny adjacent to the Erie Railroad.

Other industries which located in Kearny include: Swift &amp; Company, Koppers Company, Theobald Industries, Standard Tool &amp; Manufacturing, Wilkata Box Company, Harris Steel Company and L &amp; R Manufacturing.

Cargo ships were built at Kearny Yards during World War I, and warships during World War II.

=== Kearny Works ===

On June 15, 1928, Western Electric broke ground on their second manufacturing facility at 110 Central Avenue to be known as Kearny Works, which would grow to throughout the years and be the second- largest Western Electric manufacturing plant built before the 1930s, behind the Hawthorne Works at Cicero, Illinois.

Between 1925 and 1986, the Kearny Works of Western Electric employed as many as 24,000 in producing a variety of hardware and supplies for the Bell System. It was sold by AT&amp;T in 1984, by which time the plant had 4,000 employees who earned a total of $128 million a year, making it one of the county&#x27;s largest employers. Henry J. Hill, the mayor of Kearny at the time of the AT&amp;T Kearny Works closure, had himself worked 41 years at the facility as a manufacturing manager and retired three years prior to the closure.

=== Movie and television filming ===
In 1982, filming occurred in Kearny at a railroad bridge previously owned by Conrail until closure in 1977. The abandoned bridge, located at the Passaic River is called the NX Bridge and it was used for the motion picture, &quot;Annie&quot;. Several scenes were done with the bridge in its open position. Locals call this bridge the &quot;Annie Bridge&quot; and has not had freight operations since the closure.

Scenes from the HBO drama series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; were filmed in Kearny. One of its buildings, used for Satriale&#x27;s Pork Store, was later razed to prepare for a parking lot. An Irish pub now resides where Satriale&#x27;s was located.

The film &quot;Spinning Gold&quot;, which had been delayed during the pandemic for completion, had scenes filmed in Kearny.

The 2022 horror movie, &quot;Smile&quot; had a scene filmed at Jersey Oil located at 926 Passaic Avenue. The film is attributed as entirely filmed in New Jersey.

Kearny Point has two studios that are part of the film and television industry. Kearny Mayor Al Santos confirmed, &quot;...our vision for Kearny Point as a hub for film and television production. This investment will create employment opportunities and bring increased economic activity to our community.&quot;

== Theaters ==
Kearny had a few theaters for film showings starting in the early 20th Century. The few that had opened approximately before World War I were no longer listed among the three theaters of the 1920s and 1930s that opened. Those early movie theaters had been repurposed for other building uses either as apartments or meeting places. The ones that opened during the 1920s and 1930s took a few decades to close. The Lincoln Theater was operating until August 2015. The empty Lincoln Theater was placed for sale after the closure, until September 2022 when it was purchased for $975,000. The new owner realized opening the theater again, without movie business knowledge, would not be the plans for the business and will proceed instead to have apartments approved by the town for the property redevelopment. There are no movie theaters currently operating in the township.

Here was a list of the former theaters:
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of , including of land and of water (13.91%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the town include Arlington, New Jersey, Schuylers Corner and West Arlington.

The town is bordered by East Newark and Harrison in Hudson County, and by Lyndhurst and North Arlington in Bergen County. The Passaic River separates the town from Newark and Belleville, both located in Essex County. The Hackensack River separates it from Secaucus and Jersey City.

The town is varied in topography and roughly divided into three parts: the Kearny Uplands, the Kearny Meadows and South Kearny, where the Hackensack and Passaic rivers meet. Main thoroughfares include the eponymous Kearny Avenue (the local segment of Ridge Road / Frank E. Rodgers Boulevard), Bergen Avenue, Midland Avenue, Schuyler Avenue and Passaic Avenue.

A number of small parks running along the Passaic River are collectively called Riverbank Park. The largest, located on the colloquial &quot;Bunnyland Hill&quot;, is a gift from Kearny&#x27;s veterans. It is named after a small zoo named Bunnyland, which was maintained by the local Kiwanis Club, that occupied part of the present Bunnyland Hill in the 20th century. During Kearny&#x27;s Fourth of July celebrations (which include a fireworks display), Bunnyland Hill is the primary gathering spot for celebrants and observers. The largest park is West Hudson Park, shared with Harrison, which contains a variety of sports fields, recreational areas, and an artificial pond. The second largest recreational zone is the Kearny Playground at Gunnel Oval.

According to Ronnie Connors, assistant tax assessor, the company appealed with the town December 1982 for tax relief and agreement was reduced assessment to between $17 million and $18 million for 1983. With the closures evident, the officials needed to offset the $1.6 million loss by drawing new industry to Kearny with incentives.

Other former Catholic schools in Kearny include: Sacred Heart School and St. Cecilia School.

==Transportation==

===Roads and highways===
, the town had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Hudson County, by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

Several roadways pass through and intersect in the town. The Belleville Turnpike (Route 7) forms the northern border of the town with North Arlington and crosses the Rutgers Street Bridge over the Passaic River into Belleville. Kearny Avenue passes through the town and continues north as Ridge Road, the beginning of Route 17. U.S. Route 1/9 (Pulaski Skyway) and US 1/9 Truck pass through. The Essex Freeway (Interstate 280) passes through the town and ends at Interstate 95 (the New Jersey Turnpike eastern and western spurs) at the tollgate for Exit 15W.

===Public transportation===
NJ Transit offers bus service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan and to other New Jersey communities. Bus service to Newark is available on the 1, 30, 40, and 76 routes.
Kearny was formerly served by trains of both the Erie Railroad&#x27;s Newark Branch (later Erie-Lackawanna and then Conrail&#x27;s Newark Industrial Branch) and its Greenwood Lake Division (later the Erie-Lackawanna&#x27;s Greenwood Lake-Boonton Line; and Conrail and New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Boonton Line) which stopped at the now-abandoned Arlington station. Newark Branch passenger service was terminated in October 1966. But freight service continued until 2005, when the last remaining shipper, Spar-Tech PolyCom, shut down. However, freight service on the Newark side is still active. New Jersey Transit discontinued Boonton Line service in 2002 when the Montclair Connection was opened. Through the early 1970s trains also stopped at a second station along this route known as West Arlington. This station was just to the east of the now abandoned WR Draw movable bridge. Prior to April 30, 1967, a station in South Kearny, was served by the Central Railroad of New Jersey&#x27;s Newark and New York Branch via the PD Draw over the Passaic River. This station was popular with employees of the giant Western Electric plant, and other industries in the area. In the final years of this service a pair of rush hour trains ran in each direction between South Kearny, and the CNJ&#x27;s Broad Street Station in downtown Newark, as well as a single rush hour round trip between South Kearny, and Plainfield. This train operated via Elizabethport, and the CNJ main line. Kearny is also the location of the Meadows Maintenance Complex, the primary maintenance facility for NJ Transit rail operations.

The closest airport with scheduled passenger service is Newark Liberty International Airport, located away in Newark and Elizabeth.

<text>North Bergen is a township in the northern part of Hudson County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 63,361, an increase of 2,588 (+4.3%) from the 2010 census count of 60,773, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,681 (+4.6%) from the 58,092 counted in the 2000 census. The township was incorporated in 1843. It was much diminished in territory by a series of secessions. Situated on the Hudson Palisades, it is one of the hilliest municipalities in the United States. Like neighboring North Hudson communities, North Bergen is among those places in the nation with the highest population density.

==History==
===Colonial era===
At the time of European colonization the area was the territory of Hackensack tribe of the Lenape Native Americans, who maintained a settlement, Espatingh, on the west side of the hills and where a Dutch trading post was established after the Peach War. In 1658, Peter Stuyvesant, then Director-General of New Netherland, repurchased from them the area now encompassed by the municipalities of Hudson County east of the Hackensack River. This is commemorated in a New Deal post off mural entitled &quot;Purchase of Territory of North Bergen from the Indians&quot;. In 1660 Stuyvesant granted permission to establish the semi-autonomous colony of Bergen, with the main village located at today&#x27;s Bergen Square, considered to be the first chartered municipality in what would become the state of New Jersey. At the time, the area of North Bergen was heavily forested, traversed by paths used by the indigenous and colonizing population and became known as Bergen Woods, a name recalled in today&#x27;s neighborhood of Bergenwood.

After the 1664 surrender of Fort Amsterdam the entire New Netherland colony came into the possession of the British, who established the Province of New Jersey. In 1682, the East Jersey legislature formed the state&#x27;s first four counties, including Bergen County, which consisted of all the land in the peninsula between the Hackensack and Hudson Rivers; that is, the eastern portions of what today is Bergen and Hudson Counties. In 1693, Bergen County was divided into two townships: Hackensack Township in the north, and Bergen Township, encompassing the Bergen Neck peninsula, in the south. The border between the two townships is the current Hudson-Bergen county line.

While settlement was sparse, communities developed along the Bergen Turnpike at the Three Pigeons and Maisland, later New Durham. French botanist André Michaux developed his gardens nearby. On the Hudson River, Bulls Ferry became an important landing for crossings to Manhattan. While ostensibly under British control during the American Revolutionary War, the area was patrolled by the Americans on foraging, espionage, and raiding expeditions, most notably the Battle of Bull&#x27;s Ferry.

===Toponymy, secession, and urbanization===
On February 22, 1838, Jersey City was incorporated as a separate municipality, and in 1840 Hudson County, comprising the city and Bergen Township, was created from the southern portion of Bergen County. North Bergen was incorporated as a township on April 10, 1843, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature, from the northern portion of Bergen Township. At the time, the town included everything east of the Hackensack River and north of and including what is now Jersey City Heights.

The entire region that is now known as North Hudson experienced massive immigration and urbanization during the latter half of the 19th century, and led to the creation of various new towns. Portions of the North Bergen were taken to form Hoboken Township (April 9, 1849, now the City of Hoboken), Hudson Town (April 12, 1852, later part of Hudson City), Hudson City (April 11, 1855, later merged with Jersey City), Guttenberg (formed within the township on March 9, 1859, and set off as an independent municipality on April 1, 1878), Weehawken (March 15, 1859), Union Township and West Hoboken Township (both created on February 28, 1861), Union Hill town (March 29, 1864) and Secaucus (March 12, 1900). During this era many of Hudson County&#x27;s cemeteries were developed along the town&#x27;s western slope of the Hudson Palisades.

At their foot in the Meadowlands, the Erie, the New York, Susquehanna and Western and the West Shore railroads ran right-of-ways to their terminals on the Hudson, the last building its tunnel through Bergen Hill at North Bergen. The area was important destination during peak German immigration to the United States and is recalled today in Schuetzen Park, founded in 1874. Further north, Nungesser&#x27;s Guttenberg Racetrack became a notable and notorious destination which, after its closing, became a proving ground for new technologies: the automobile and the airplane.

===20th century===
The development of &quot;Hudson County Boulevard&quot;, which skirts around the west, north and east of North Bergen, was completed in the early 20th century. By 1913 it was considered to be fine for &quot;motoring&quot;. The roadway is now known by its two sections: Kennedy Boulevard and Boulevard East.

Residential districts along and between the two boulevards were developed. Bergenline Avenue, a broad street which accommodated the North Hudson County Railway streetcars to Nungesser&#x27;s became (and remains) an important commercial and transit corridor. The two boulevard sections met at Bergenline Avenue, at the northwest corner of North Hudson/Braddock Park.
Soon after the opening of the Lincoln Tunnel Approach, the Susquehanna Transfer was opened in August 1939 to accommodate passengers who wished to transfer to buses through the tunnel to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It closed in 1966.

At the time of its construction in 1949, the WOR TV Tower, in the midst of the residential Woodcliff Section, was the tenth-tallest man-made structure in the world. The tower was dismantled in 1956 but in 1967, about half a mile (2500 m) to the east, the 34-story, Stonehenge apartment building was constructed on the tip of the Palisades.

In the early 1960s two notable paleontological finds of fossils from the Newark Basin were made near the foot of the cliffs at one of several former quarries, the Granton, of which today&#x27;s avenue is a namesake. The former quarry remained an archeological site until at least 1980.

North Hudson Park was renamed the James J. Braddock North Hudson County Park. In 1935, while living in North Bergen, local hero James J. Braddock won the world heavyweight championship in one of the most stunning upsets in boxing history.

In contrast to other Hudson County communities during the latter half of the century, North Bergen grew significantly in population. Many residents are part of the wave of Spanish language speakers which had begun in the 1960s with Cuban émigrés, leading to the nickname, Havana on the Hudson.

==Geography==
In 1850, the township was roughly rectangular. When the municipalities along the Hudson River (what are now Guttenberg, West New York, Union City and Weehawken) broke away, it left North Bergen roughly an inverted &quot;L&quot;, or &quot;axe-shaped&quot;. Its northern section stretches east–west and is south of the Bergen County communities of Cliffside Park, Edgewater, Fairview and Ridgefield. To the east, the Hudson River creates the shared border with the borough of Manhattan in New York City. It shares a border with Carlstadt in the Hackensack River. Its north–south section lies between Secaucus to the west and to the east Guttenberg, West New York and Union City, with which it meets Jersey City at a single point at its southern end. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 5.57 square miles (14.43 km2), including 5.14 square miles (13.30 km2) of land and 0.44 square miles (1.13 km2) of water (7.83%).

North Bergen has diverse geological features. Partially situated on the Hudson River, the Hudson Palisades rise from the waterfront, while the northern part of the town sits atop the plateau. The cuesta, or slope, on its west side makes North Bergen the city with the second-most hills per square mile in the United States after San Francisco, some of which are extremely steep. A rock formation along the slope (located at ) is made up of unusual serpentinite rock and made up of small rock cliffs. Because of this, it is one of the few undeveloped parts of North Bergen. Low-lying areas along the west side are part of the New Jersey Meadowlands. The unusual shape and diverse topography of North Bergen have created diverse historical and contemporary neighborhoods:

* Bergenline Avenue runs to Nungessers at the Fairview border near North Hudson Park. It has been described as the longest commercial avenue in the state, with over 300 retail stores and restaurants.
* The Racetrack section, between Bergenline and Kennedy Boulevard on the plateau.
* Bergenwood, on the steep slopes of the west side of the Palisades.
* New Durham, site of colonial American Three Pigeons near the Bergen Turnpike and Tonnelle Avenue.
* Meadowview, behind the Municipal Building between the many cemeteries.
* Bulls Ferry, on the Hudson waterfront, site of Roc Harbor, Palisades Medical Center and the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway
* Babbitt, in the Meadowlands district, a part of which is a wetlands preserve known as the Eastern Brackish Marsh.
* Woodcliff on The Palisades around the North Hudson Park.
* Transfer Station near the tripoint with Union City and Jersey City near Paterson Plank Road, Kennedy Boulevard, and Secaucus Road in Secaucus.

Other historical unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Homestead, Granton, Hudson Heights, New Durham, Shadyside, Three Pigeons and Tyler Park.

The town has seven cemeteries, more than any other town in the county, including some, such as Weehawken Cemetery and Hoboken Cemetery, that were at one time designated for other towns. This may be due to the layout of the county in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with North Bergen having more land than its more densely populated neighbors, which had to bury their dead outside of town. It may also date back to the Civil War era. Among these cemeteries are Flower Hill Cemetery and Grove Church Cemetery.

Portions of the city are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone (UEZ), one of 32 zones covering 37 municipalities statewide. Union City was selected in 1996 as one of a group of seven zones added to participate in the program. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment and investment within the UEZ, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the % rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants. Established in April 1995, the city&#x27;s Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in April 2026. The zone was established based on legislation passed in February 1995 through the efforts of Senator Sacco, one of the sponsors of legislation creating the zones.

Hudson News and Liz Claiborne are large employers. New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway operates five intermodal freight transport facilities within the township.

==Government==
===Local government===
North Bergen has been governed under the Walsh Act form of New Jersey municipal government since 1931. The township is one of 30 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use the form of government. The governing body is comprised of five commissioners elected at-large to the Township Committee in non-partisan elections to serve four-year terms of office on a concurrent basis. After each election, each individual is assigned to head one of the five commissions and the commissioners select one of their members to serve as mayor.

===Corruption===
After serving as Township Clerk from 1971 to 1979, Joseph Mocco was arrested on August 7, 1986, on charges of illegally dumping tons of construction material within North Bergen and other nearby communities. Mocco was convicted and began serving a prison sentence in July 1995. Mocco was paroled in 1999, with several special conditions imposed on him upon his release by the New Jersey State Parole Board designed to prohibit him from working or participating in local elections.

In February 2004, Peter Perez, former commissioner in charge of Parks and Recreation, was sentenced to serve six months in a federal prison for accepting kickbacks and bribes from a contractor who had several business contracts with the township. He received a reduced sentence in light of his cooperation with authorities.

On March 27, 2008, North Bergen Athletic Director Jerry Maietta and Guidance Counselor Ralph Marino were among 45 men swept up in a Bergen County raid. Bergen County prosecutors described the two as lower level operatives in an expansive network of bookies, package holders, drug dealers and drug distributors. Other transactions included knock-off women&#x27;s purses and human organs.

On September 11, 2012, North Bergen&#x27;s Superintendent of the Department of Public Works James Wiley pleaded guilty to one count of second degree conspiracy to commit official misconduct. Wiley was convicted for using the town&#x27;s resources to participate in political campaigns. In November 2015, two DPW supervisors were sentenced to five years in prison following their convictions on charges that they had directed department workers to work on political campaigns and perform work on behalf of supervisors and other officials.

A 2013 report issued by the office of the New Jersey State Comptroller stated that an attorney had been hired by the township between 1988 and 1990 for a no-show job for which he had been paid an annual salary of $18,800 plus benefits.

<doc id="125241" wikidata="Q1013249" url="?curid=125241" title="Secaucus, New Jersey">
<text>Secaucus ( ) is a town in Hudson County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 22,181, an increase of 5,917 (+36.4%) from the 2010 census count of 16,264, which in turn reflected an increase of 333 (+2.1%) from the 15,931 counted in the 2000 census.

Located within the New Jersey Meadowlands, it is the most suburban of the county&#x27;s municipalities, though large parts of the town are dedicated to light manufacturing, retail, and transportation uses, as well as protected areas.

Secaucus is a derivation of the Algonquian words for &quot;black&quot; (&quot;seke&quot; or &quot;sukit&quot;) and &quot;snake&quot; (&quot;achgook&quot;), or &quot;place of snakes&quot;, or &quot;sekakes&quot;, referring to snakes.

==History==
&quot;Sikakes&quot;, once an island, was part of the territory purchased by Director-General of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant in 1658. The territory was part of what is considered to be the oldest municipality in the state of New Jersey which was first chartered in 1660 as Bergen in the province of New Netherland and, in 1683, became Bergen Township.

Settlement had begun by at least 1733 by the Smith family, whose namesake Abel I. Smith Burial Ground is part of the lore of Secaucus.

Secaucus was originally formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 12, 1900, from portions of North Bergen. On June 7, 1917, Secaucus was incorporated as a town, replacing Secaucus borough, based on the results of a referendum held on June 5, 1917.

Secaucus was originally an agricultural community specializing in flowers. It later became known for its pig farms in the first half of the 20th century. In the early 1900s the town was home to approximately 55 pig farms, which reached a peak of nearly 250,000 pigs in World War II, outnumbering humans 16 to 1. These farms served the meat demands of Newark and New York, and made the farmers wealthy. Many of them were local politicians, most notably pork peddler Henry B. Krajewski, who ran for New Jersey senator, three times for governor and twice for U.S. President. The town&#x27;s pig farms, rendering plants, and junk yards gave the town a reputation for being one of the most odorous in the New York metropolitan area. An ordinance passed in 1947 prohibited new farms, and in the 1950s the pig farms began to dwindle, partially after 11 of the farms were acquired for construction of the New Jersey Turnpike, which would carry tourists who would not appreciate the odor; the last farms were shut down by court order in the late 1950s.

In 1963, debris from the demolition of Pennsylvania Station was dumped in the Secaucus Meadowlands. In later decades Secaucus became more of a commuter town. In a non-binding referendum in 1969, 90% of voters in Secaucus chose to leave Hudson County and join Bergen County, as that county was more similar in character and had lower taxes. However, only the state has the authority to change county lines, so it never came to fruition. Today it remains the most suburban town in Hudson County. Despite being geographically located within Hudson County, Secaucus Public Library is a member of the Bergen County Cooperative Library System.

On February 9, 1996, two NJ Transit commuter trains collided at Bergen Junction in Secaucus when a train operating on the Bergen Line ran a signal and sideswiped a train running on the Main Line. The accident occurred during the morning rush hour just south of the current Secaucus Junction station. With three fatalities, the incident is NJ Transit&#x27;s deadliest accident and was the first to involve fatalities of the passenger and crew on NJ Transit.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Secaucus as its 182nd best place to live in its 2010 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey, after ranking the borough 11th in its 2008 rankings.

==Geography==
Secaucus is an island in the New Jersey Meadowlands. The Hackensack River runs along western side of town. Penhorn Creek and Cromakill Creek are its eastern borders.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 6.54 square miles (16.95 km2), including 5.83 square miles (15.09 km2) of land and 0.72 square miles (1.86 km2) of water (10.96%).

At the southern end of Secaucus is Snake Hill (officially known as Laurel Hill), an igneous rock diabase intrusion jutting up some from the Meadowlands below, near the New Jersey Turnpike.

Being partly surrounded by the meadowlands, Secaucus provides opportunities to observe the recovery of natural marshes in the town&#x27;s post-industrial, post-agricultural age. Some marsh areas in the northeast part of town have been filled to provide a new commercial area, and some to build footpaths for nature walks with signs illustrating birds and other wildlife to be seen there. At 27.4%, it has the most open &quot;green&quot; space in of any town in Hudson County.

Secaucus borders the municipalities of Jersey City, Kearny and North Bergen in Hudson County; and Carlstadt, East Rutherford, Lyndhurst, Rutherford in Bergen County.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the town include:
* County Avenue – from Municipal Building to Secaucus Junction
* Harmon Cove – along the Hackensack River and Meadowlands Turnpike
* Harmon Meadow – site of Mill Creek Mall and Meadowlands Convention Center
* Laurel Hill
* Little Snake Hill
* Mill Creek Marsh
* North End – north of New Jersey Route 3; home of Secaucus High School, Schmiddt&#x27;s Woods, and Mill Creek Marsh
* Riverbend – a wetlands preserve at the meander in the Hackensack River
* Secaucus Junction – NJ Transit&#x27;s central rail hub
* Secaucus Plaza Central Business District at Paterson Plank Road south of Route 3
* Snake Hill – site of Laurel Hill County Park

===Subsections===
====North End====

As its name suggests, the North End in Secaucus, New Jersey, is the section of town north of New Jersey Route 3 and the Secaucus Plaza Central Business District, to which it is connected by Paterson Plank Road. The Hackensack River and its tributary Mill Creek create the other borders for the district.

The North End is one of the older, traditional residential neighborhoods of Secaucus, which itself has been transformed to a commuter town and retail and outlet shopping area in the late 20th century. It is home to Secaucus High School, whose athletic fields are used by the Bergen County Scholastic League. Nearby Schmiddt&#x27;s Wood is one of the last original hardwood forests in urban North Jersey. As part of the New Jersey Meadowlands District, the areas along the river are characterized by wetlands preservation and restoration areas. Mill Creek Marsh is park administered by the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission and will eventually connect to the Secaucus Greenway. It southern counterpart is known as Riverbend. The Mill Creek Mall, which is part of Harmon Meadow, is also located north of Route 3, but on the other side of Mill Creek, close to the New Jersey Turnpike Eastern Spur.

====Harmon Cove====

Harmon Cove is the western section of Secaucus, New Jersey along the Hackensack River, south of New Jersey Route 3. The name is portmanteau taken from Hartz Mountain, a corporation that owns much land in the New Jersey Meadowlands, which originally developed the area as a gated community in the 1970s with townhouses and highrise residential buildings. Part of the Hackensack RiverWalk Secaucus Greenway passes through the neighborhood, which is north of Anderson Marsh and Snake Hill, home to Hudson County&#x27;s Laurel Hill Park.

NJ Transit maintained a Harmon Cove station from 1978 until the re-routing of the Bergen County Line and the opening of Secaucus Junction in August 2003. This caused NJ Transit bus 972 to be created, which connected the area of the Harmon Cove station to Secaucus Junction, and in 2006 the route was renumbered to 329. The HX Draw is used by the line to cross the river. NJ Transit bus 329 serves the area. The Hudson Regional Hospital and several hotels are located in Harmon Cove, whose main thoroughfare is Meadowlands Parkway, along which office and manufacturing buildings are found. The Harmon Cove Outlet Center is an outlet shopping district further inland from the Hackensack riverfront. Hartz Mountain Industries operates many facilities and properties in Harmon Cove.
