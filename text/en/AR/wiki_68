<text>David Howell Evans (born 8 August 1961), better known as the Edge or simply Edge, is a British-Irish musician, singer, and songwriter. He is best known as the lead guitarist, keyboardist, and backing vocalist of the rock band U2. A member of the group since its inception, he has recorded 15 studio albums with them as well as one solo record. His understated style of guitar playing, a signature of U2&#x27;s music, is distinguished by chiming timbres, use of rhythmic delay, drone notes, harmonics, and an extensive use of effects units.

Born in England to Welsh parents and raised in Ireland, the Edge formed the band that would become U2 with his classmates at Mount Temple Comprehensive School and his elder brother Dik in 1976. Inspired by the ethos of punk rock and its basic arrangements, the group began to write its own material. They eventually became one of the most successful acts in popular music, with albums such as 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and 1991&#x27;s &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. Over the years, the Edge has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style, including American roots music, industrial music, and alternative rock. With U2, the Edge has also played keyboards, produced their records &quot;Zooropa&quot; (1993) and &quot;Songs of Surrender&quot; (2023), and occasionally served as co-lyricist. The Edge met his second wife, Morleigh Steinberg, through her collaborations with the band.

As a member of U2 and as an individual, the Edge has campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes. He co-founded Music Rising, a charity to support musicians affected by Hurricane Katrina. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate Bono on several projects, including songs for Roy Orbison, Tina Turner, and Martin Garrix, and the soundtracks to the musical &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot; and the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s London stage adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. As a member of U2, the Edge has won 22 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Several music publications have ranked the Edge among the greatest guitarists of all time.

==Early life==
David Howell Evans was born on 8 August 1961 at the Barking Maternity Hospital in Barking, Essex, the second child of Welsh parents Garvin and Gwenda Evans. Both of his parents were from Llanelli. His father was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board, and subsequently worked for the electronics company Plessey. Evans has an elder brother called Richard (often called Dik) and a younger sister called Gillian, and is a cousin of actress Juliet Aubrey. The family initially lived in Chadwell Heath. Around 1962, Garvin was offered a promotion which took the family to Dublin. During his childhood in Dublin, Evans talked in two different accents, using a Welsh accent at home and an Irish accent whenever he was outside. He later said, &quot;The reason for this dual identity was mainly to be understood by my peers but also to be accepted.&quot; He later commented that there were times of frustration for him growing up in a Catholic country, and this may have played a part in his musical development. Evans has retained his British citizenship into adulthood.

Evans received his initial formal education at St. Andrew&#x27;s National School in Malahide. As a child, he also received piano and guitar lessons and practised music with Dik. He received his first guitar at the age of seven when his mother bought him a Spanish guitar. He did not know how to properly tune it or hold it and referred to it as &quot;little more than a toy&quot;, but he was fascinated by how cool it was. At the age of nine, the &quot;first proper guitar&quot; came to the Evans household when his mother purchased an old acoustic guitar at a jumble sale for a pound. He and Dik both experimented with this instrument, replacing the rusty wire strings with nylon ones and learning to play it properly. The Edge said in 1982 of this early experimentation, &quot;Me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that.&quot;

==Musical career==
===U2===
While the Evans brothers were at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin in 1976, they went along to a meeting in response to an advert posted by another pupil, Larry Mullen Jr., on the school&#x27;s noticeboard seeking musicians to form a new band with him. Among the several other pupils who also responded to the note were Paul &quot;Bono&quot; Hewson and Adam Clayton. The band went through a number of reformations before becoming known as U2 in March 1978 (Richard Evans having left before this to join another band, leaving his younger brother as the lead guitarist).

Early in the band&#x27;s career, Evans was given the nickname &quot;the Edge&quot; by members of the Lypton Village surrealist street gang to which Bono belonged. The nickname is commonly believed to be derived from the angular shape of Evans&#x27; head. However, the origin of the name is disputed and other theories include a description of his guitar playing and his preference for not becoming fully involved and therefore remaining on the edge of things.
U2 began its public performance life in small venues in Dublin in 1977, occasionally playing at other venues elsewhere in Ireland. In December 1979, they performed their first concerts outside Ireland, in London, and in 1980 began extensive touring across the British Isles, developing a following. Their debut album &quot;Boy&quot; was released in 1980.

In 1981, leading up to the October Tour, the Edge came very close to leaving U2 for religious reasons, but he decided to stay. During this period he became involved with a group called the Shalom Fellowship, with which Bono and Mullen were also involved. Shortly after deciding to remain with the band, he wrote a piece of music that later became &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;.

The Edge received his first production credit on the band&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Zooropa&quot; for the extra level of responsibility he assumed in its creation. 

In 2024, the Edge co-directed &quot;V-U2 An Immersive Concert Film&quot; with his wife Morleigh Steinberg. The film documents U2&#x27;s 2023–2024 concert residency U2:UV &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; Live at Sphere and will screen exclusively at Sphere.

===Other musical pursuits===
In addition to his regular role within U2, the Edge has also recorded with such artists as Johnny Cash, B. B. King, Tina Turner, Ronnie Wood, Jah Wobble, Holger Czukay, Jay-Z, and Rihanna. Through his working relationships with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, the Edge connected with Michael Brook (the creator of the infinite guitar) and collaborated with him on the score to the film &quot;Captive&quot; (1986). The soundtrack included the song &quot;Heroine&quot;, the vocal of which was co-written and sung by a young Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. Larry Mullen Jr played drums on the track.
The Edge has collaborated with U2 bandmate Bono on numerous musical projects outside of the group. They wrote the musical score for the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s London stage adaptation of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, which opened in 1990. The duo also wrote the eponymous theme song of the 1995 James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, which was performed by Tina Turner. The Edge and Bono ventured into theatre again when they composed the music and lyrics for the musical &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;, which opened in 2011. A single titled &quot;Rise Above 1&quot; by Reeve Carney, featuring Bono and the Edge, was released digitally from the musical&#x27;s soundtrack. The music video was released on 28 July 2011. The Edge and Bono collaborated with Dutch DJ Martin Garrix on the song &quot;We Are the People&quot;, which served as the official song of the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament and was released on 14 May 2021.

The Edge wrote the theme song for seasons one and two of &quot;The Batman&quot;, which aired in 2004 and 2005 respectively.

In 2008, the Edge participated in the Davis Guggenheim-directed documentary film &quot;It Might Get Loud&quot;. The film examines the history of the electric guitar, focusing on the careers and styles of the Edge, Jimmy Page, and Jack White. The film premiered on 5 September 2008 at the Toronto International Film Festival

On 29 April 2016, the Edge performed in the Sistine Chapel as part of a conference for the Angiogenesis Foundation, making him the first rock artist to stage a concert at the site.

In 2023, the Edge was a guest musician on the songs &quot;Train with No Station&quot; and &quot;Noche Oscura&quot; for the album &quot;Los Angeles&quot; by Lol Tolhurst, Budgie, and Jacknife Lee.

==Musical style==
=== Guitar playing ===
The Edge&#x27;s style of playing guitar is distinguished by his chiming timbres, echoing notes, sparse voicings, and extensive use of effects units. He favours the perfect fifth interval and often plays power chords, which are chords consisting of just the fifth and root notes and that eliminate the third. This style is not explicitly in a major or minor key but implies both, creating a musical ambiguity. For these chords, he often plays the same notes on multiple strings, some of which are left open, creating an Irish-influenced drone. Against this drone, he changes other notes to imply a harmony. Among the Edge&#x27;s signature techniques are playing arpeggios, sixteenth note percussive strumming, and harmonics, the latter of which he described as &quot;so pure and finely-focused that [they have] the incredible ability to pierce through [their] environment of sound, just like lightning&quot;. Author Henrik Marstal said that his use of harmonics and chiming timbres &quot;emulates the concept of bell ringing&quot; and &quot;embod[ies] a spiritual dimension&quot;.

The Edge takes a relatively understated approach to guitar playing, viewing notes as &quot;expensive&quot; and preferring to play simple parts that best serve their song. He eschews virtuosity in favour of &quot;atmospherics, subtlety, minimalism, and clever signal processing&quot;, according to &quot;Guitar Player&quot;. Rather than emulate common playing styles, the Edge is interested in &quot;tearing up the rule book&quot; and finding new ways to approach the instrument; he was inspired by guitarists such as Tom Verlaine of Television, Keith Levene of Public Image Ltd, and John McKay of Siouxsie and the Banshees, who he thought &quot;were all playing the instrument in a fresh way&quot;. The Edge also cited guitarists such as John McGeoch, Rory Gallagher, and Patti Smith as some of his strongest influences. 
The Edge&#x27;s guitar sound is frequently modulated with a delay set to a dotted eighth note for rhythmic effect. After acquiring his first delay pedal, the Electro-Harmonix Memory Man, he became fascinated with how to use its return echo to &quot;fill in notes that [he&#x27;s] not playing, like two guitar players rather than one&quot;. The effect unit became a mainstay in his guitar rig and had a significant impact on the band&#x27;s creative output. The Edge became known for his extensive use of effects units, and for his meticulous nature in crafting specific sounds and guitar tones from his equipment choices. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page called him a &quot;sonic architect&quot;, while Neil McCormick described him as an &quot;effects maestro&quot;. Critics have variously referred to the Edge&#x27;s guitar sounds as evoking the image of fighter planes on &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;, resembling a &quot;dentist&#x27;s drill&quot; on &quot;Love Is Blindness&quot;, and resembling an &quot;airplane turbine&quot; on &quot;Mofo&quot;. The Edge said that rather than using effects merely to modify his sound, he uses them to spark ideas during his songwriting process.
The Edge developed his playing style during his teenage years, partially as a result of him and Mullen trying to accommodate the &quot;eccentric&quot; bass playing of Clayton by being the timekeepers of the band. In their early days, the Edge&#x27;s only guitar was his 1976 Gibson Explorer Limited Edition, which became a signature of the group. However, he found the sound of the Explorer&#x27;s bass strings unsatisfactory and avoided them in his playing early on, resulting in a trebly sound. He said by focusing &quot;on one area of the fretboard [he] was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way&quot;. Other equipment choices contribute to the Edge&#x27;s unique sound. His 1964 Vox AC30 &quot;Top Boost&quot; amplifier (housed in a 1970s cabinet) is favoured for its &quot;sparkle&quot; tone, and is the basis for his sound both in the studio and live. The Edge has also used plectrums manufactured by the German company Herdim that he turns sideways or upside down so the dimpled grip strums against the strings, resulting in a &quot;rasping top end&quot; to his guitar tone.

About his playing style, the Edge said in 1982:
=== Vocals ===

The Edge provides the backing vocals for U2. Their 1983 live album and video release, &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; and &quot;U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; are good reference points for his singing (as are the live DVDs from the Elevation Tour, &quot;U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle&quot; and &quot;Elevation 2001: Live from Boston&quot;). For example, he sings the chorus to &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (Bono harmonises on the final &#x27;Sunday&#x27;). U2 used this tradeoff technique later in &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; as well. His backing vocals are sometimes in the form of a repeated cry; examples of songs that use this approach include &quot;Beautiful Day&quot;, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close!)&quot;. Another technique he uses in his backing vocals is the falsetto, in songs such as &quot;Stuck in a Moment You Can&#x27;t Get Out Of&quot;, &quot;Sometimes You Can&#x27;t Make It on Your Own&quot;, &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;, &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, live versions of &quot;The Fly&quot;, and &quot;Window in the Skies&quot;.

The Edge sings the lead vocal on &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;, the first half of the song &quot;Seconds&quot;, dual vocals with Bono in &quot;Discotheque&quot;, and the bridge in the song &quot;Miracle Drug&quot;. He also sings the occasional lead vocal in live renditions of other songs (such as &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; during the PopMart Tour and &quot;Party Girl&quot; during the Rotterdam Zoo TV show when it was Bono&#x27;s birthday), and has sung the second verse of the &quot;Stand by Me&quot; cover on a few shows. A solo acoustic version of the song &quot;Love is Blindness&quot;, which is featured in the documentary film &quot;From the Sky Down&quot;, is sung by him as well.

=== Other instruments ===
He has played keyboards on many of the band&#x27;s songs, including &quot;I Fall Down&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;So Cruel&quot;, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;, &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot;, &quot;The Hands that Built America&quot;, and &quot;Original of the Species&quot; and others. In live versions of &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, &quot;Your Blue Room&quot;, &quot;Moment of Surrender&quot; and &quot;Raised By Wolves&quot;, he plays both the piano and guitar parts alternately. In most live versions of &quot;Original of the Species&quot;, piano is the only instrument played during the song. Although the Edge is the band&#x27;s lead guitarist, he occasionally plays bass guitar, including the live performances of the song &quot;40&quot; where the Edge and bassist Adam Clayton switch instruments.

===Equipment===

The Edge plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards, piano, bass guitar (on &quot;40&quot; and &quot;Race Against Time&quot;) and lap steel guitar. Detailed gear diagrams of the Edge&#x27;s U2 guitar rig for the 1981 October Tour, the 1983 War Tour, and the 2009 U2 360° Tour are well-documented. In 2016, Fender unveiled a signature model of guitar and amplifier designed in collaboration with the Edge: the Edge Signature Stratocaster and the Fender Edge Deluxe, respectively.

==Personal life==

Evans was raised as a Protestant and was, along with fellow band members Bono and Mullen, involved with non-denominational Christian group the Shalom Fellowship as an adult.

Evans married his secondary school girlfriend, Aislinn O&#x27;Sullivan, on 12 July 1983. They have three daughters named Hollie (born 1984), Arran (born 1985), and Blue Angel (born 1989). The couple separated in 1990; Ireland did not have a provision for divorce at that time but divorce was legalised in 1995 and the couple divorced in 1996. In 1993, he began dating Morleigh Steinberg, an American professional dancer who was employed by U2 as a choreographer and dancer during the Zoo TV Tour. They have a daughter and a son. The couple married in Nice, France, in 2002.

In 1992, the Edge and Bono bought and refurbished Dublin&#x27;s two-star 70-bedroom Clarence Hotel, and converted it into a five-star 49-bedroom hotel. In 2019, they sold the hotel leasehold, but they continue to own the building with Paddy McKillen Sr.

Evans has been criticised for his efforts to build five luxury mansions on a 156-acre (63.13-hectare) plot of land in Malibu, California. The California Coastal Commission voted 8–4 against his plans. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy agreed to remain neutral on the issue following a $1 million donation from Evans and a commitment to designate 100 acres of the land as open space for public footpaths.

The Edge reportedly has a net worth of £330 million.

== Discography ==

==Philanthropy==

The Edge, Bob Ezrin and Henry Juszkiewicz co-founded Music Rising in 2005, a charity that helped provide replacement instruments for those that were lost in Hurricane Katrina. The instruments were originally only replaced for professional musicians but they soon realised the community churches and schools needed instruments as well. The charity&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Rebuilding the Gulf Region note by note&quot; and has so far helped over a hundred musicians who were affected by Hurricane Katrina. The Edge also serves on the board of the Angiogenesis Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organisation dedicated to improving global health by advancing angiogenesis-based medicine, diets, and lifestyle. In 2021, the Edge partnered with the charity Love Welcomes to sell a line of guitar straps that were handsewn by refugee women and featured a Morse code pattern; proceeds from sales of the strap benefitted employment and support of refugee women.

==Awards and recognition==
The Edge has won numerous awards with U2, including 22 Grammy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song (for &quot;The Hands That Built America&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Ordinary Love&quot; in 2014). In 2005, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of U2, in the group&#x27;s first year of eligibility. In 2007, he received an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music. At the 2017 Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Edge was honoured with the Les Paul Spirit Award by the Les Paul Foundation for being someone who &quot;exemplifies the spirit of the late, great Les Paul through innovation, engineering, technology and/or music&quot;. In May 2024, the Venice Family Clinic presented its inaugural HEART Award to the Edge and his wife Morleigh Steinberg, who are longtime supporters of the center, at its inaugural HEART (Health + Art) Gala.

In 2010, Gibson ranked him the 23rd-best guitarist of all time, saying that he &quot;created a sound that is distinctly his own – no small feat when you consider he&#x27;s had to do it in the course of three decades while working shoulder-to-shoulder with one of the biggest personalities in rock, Bono&quot;. The following year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the Edge at number 38 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;; Daniel Lanois called him an &quot;innovative mind&quot;, a &quot;scientist, and a poet by night&quot;, and said he is &quot;dedicated to note-taking&quot; to &quot;document every detail of his sound&quot;. The magazine re-ranked the Edge to 47th place on its expanded 2023 list of the 250 greatest guitarists. In 2012, &quot;Spin&quot; ranked him 13th on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists, saying that he &quot;masked and flaunted his willful ignorance of how guitars are meant to be played with forgiving delay pedals, forging a sonic trademark so distinctive that his band&#x27;s name became an adjective&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Bono and the Edge at number 35 on its list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.

<text>Adam Charles Clayton (born 13 March 1960) is an English-Irish musician who is the bass guitarist of the rock band U2. Born in Oxfordshire, England, he lived in County Dublin, Ireland after his family moved to Malahide in 1965, when he was five years old. Clayton attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School, where he met schoolmates with whom he co-founded U2 in 1976. A member of the band since its inception, he has recorded 15 studio albums with U2.

Clayton&#x27;s bass playing style is noted for its &quot;harmonic syncopation&quot;, giving the music a driving rhythm. He is well known for his bass playing on songs such as &quot;Gloria&quot;, &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;, &quot;With or Without You&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Get On Your Boots&quot;, and &quot;Magnificent&quot;. He has worked on several solo projects throughout his career, such as his work with fellow band member Larry Mullen Jr. on the 1996 version of the &quot;Theme from &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;&quot;. As a member of U2, Clayton has received 22 Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Early life==
Adam Charles Clayton, the oldest child of Brian and Jo Clayton, was born on 13 March 1960 in Chinnor, Oxfordshire, England. His father was a pilot with the Royal Air Force who moved into civil aviation, and his mother was a former airline stewardess. When Clayton was four years old, his father worked in Kenya as a pilot with East African Airways, with the family residing in Nairobi; Clayton regards this as the happiest period of his childhood. In 1965, the family moved to Malahide, northern County Dublin, Ireland, where Clayton&#x27;s brother Sebastian was born. The Clayton family became friends with the Evans family (including their son David Evans (&quot;The Edge&quot;), who later co-founded the band U2 with Clayton).

When he was eight years old, Clayton was sent to the private junior boarding Castle Park School in Dalkey, southern County Dublin. Not being sports-oriented, Clayton did not enjoy the school or respond well to its ethos; he found it difficult to settle socially there. He was interested in pop music, which students were not allowed to listen to. He joined the School&#x27;s &quot;Gramphone Society&quot;, which met to listen to classical music. He also took piano lessons for a short time. His introduction to the world of popular music was around age 10, listening to rock operas such as &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Hair&quot;, and other material that was midway between classical and popular music.
At age 13, Clayton entered the private St Columba&#x27;s College secondary school in Rathfarnham, Dublin. Here he made friends with other pupils who were enthusiastic about the pop/rock music acts of the period, including the Who, the Beatles, Grateful Dead, and Carole King. In response, he bought a £5 acoustic guitar from a junk shop near the Dublin quays, and began learning elementary chords and songs. John Leslie, who shared a bunk bed with Clayton at St. Columba&#x27;s, persuaded him to join in with a school band where Clayton played the bass guitar for the first time. His mother purchased a bass for him when he was 14 when Clayton promised that he would commit himself to learn to play the instrument.

Clayton later changed school to the non-boarding Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin, where he met future U2 bandmates Paul Hewson (&quot;Bono&quot;) and Larry Mullen Jr., who were also pupils there, and was reunited with his childhood friend David Evans.

==Musical career==
=== U2 ===
In September 1976, Mullen put an advert onto the school&#x27;s bulletin board seeking other musicians to form a band; Clayton showed up for the first meeting and practice, as did the Edge with his older brother Richard Evans (&quot;Dik&quot;), Bono, and Mullen&#x27;s friends Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, who both left the band soon after its inception.

While the band was a five-piece (consisting of Bono, the Edge, Mullen, Dik Evans, and Clayton) it was known as &quot;Feedback&quot;. The name was subsequently changed to &quot;The Hype&quot;, but changed to &quot;U2&quot; soon after Dik Evans left. Clayton stood in as the nearest thing that the band had to a manager in its early life, handing over the duties to Paul McGuinness in May 1978. In 1981, around the time of U2&#x27;s second, spiritually charged album, &quot;October&quot;, a rift occurred between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were questioning the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider.

In 1995, after the Zoo TV Tour and &quot;Zooropa&quot; album, Clayton went to New York with bandmate Mullen to receive formal training in the bass; until then, Clayton had been entirely self-taught. During that period, Clayton worked on U2&#x27;s experimental album, released under the pseudonym &quot;Passengers&quot;, entitled &quot;Original Soundtracks 1&quot;. That album features one of the few instances where Clayton has appeared as a vocalist; he spoke the last verse of &quot;Your Blue Room&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single. Prior to this Clayton had only provided live backing vocals to tracks such as &quot;Out of Control&quot;, &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, &quot;Twilight&quot;, and &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;. Since the 1997 PopMart Tour, Clayton has not sung live in any capacity for the band.

===Other projects===
Clayton has worked on several side projects throughout his career. He played (along with the other members of U2) on Robbie Robertson&#x27;s self-titled album from 1987, and has also performed with Maria McKee. Clayton joined U2 producer Daniel Lanois and bandmate Larry Mullen Jr. on Lanois&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Acadie&quot;, playing the bass on the songs &quot;Still Water&quot; and &quot;Jolie Louise&quot;. Clayton played on Sharon Shannon&#x27;s song &quot;The Marguerita Suite&quot; from her self-titled debut album, which was released in October 1991. In 1994, Clayton played bass alongside Mullen on Nanci Griffith&#x27;s album &quot;Flyer&quot;, appearing on the songs &quot;These Days in an Open Book&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget About Me&quot;, &quot;On Grafton Street&quot; and &quot;This Heart&quot;.

Clayton and Mullen contributed to of the 1996 film &quot;&quot;, which included reworking the &quot;Theme from &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;&quot;, whose time signature was changed from the original time signature to an easier and more danceable time signature. The song reached number 8 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997. Clayton was also featured on Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Born Again Savage&quot;.

==Musical style==

Clayton&#x27;s style of bass guitar playing is noted for what instructor Patrick Pfeiffer called &quot;harmonic syncopation&quot;. With this technique, Clayton plays a consistent rhythm that stresses the eighth note of each bar, but he &quot;anticipates the harmony by shifting the tonality&quot; before the guitar chords do. This gives the music a feeling of &quot;forward motion&quot;. Initially, Clayton had no formal musical training; Bono said of Clayton&#x27;s early bass playing, &quot;Adam used to pretend he could play bass. He came round and started using words like &#x27;action&#x27; and &#x27;fret&#x27; and he had us baffled. He had the only amplifier, so we never argued with him. We thought this guy must be a musician; he knows what he&#x27;s talking about. And then one day, we discovered he wasn&#x27;t playing the right notes. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong, y&#x27;know?&quot; In the band&#x27;s early years, Clayton generally played simple bass parts in time consisting of steady eighth notes emphasising the roots of chords. Over time, he incorporated influences from Motown and reggae into his playing style, and as he became a better timekeeper, his playing became more melodic. Author Bill Flanagan said that he &quot;often plays with the swollen, vibrating bottom sound of a Jamaican dub bassist, covering the most sonic space with the smallest number of notes&quot;. Flanagan said that Clayton&#x27;s playing style perfectly reflected his personality: &quot;Adam plays a little behind the beat, waiting till the last moment to slip in, which fits Adam&#x27;s casual, don&#x27;t-sweat-it personality.&quot;

Clayton relies on his own instincts when developing basslines, deciding whether to follow the chord progressions of the guitars or play a counter-melody, and when to play an octave higher or lower. He cites bassists such as Paul Simonon, Bruce Foxton, Peter Hook, Jean-Jacques Burnel, and James Jamerson as major influences on him. He credits Jacques Burnel for his choice of instrument, saying that upon hearing his bass guitar playing in the Stranglers&#x27; song &quot;Hanging Around&quot;, Clayton &quot;immediately [knew] it was going to be the instrument for [him]&quot;. Describing his role in U2&#x27;s rhythm section with drummer Larry Mullen Jr., Clayton said, &quot;Larry&#x27;s drums have always told me what to play, and then the chords tell me where to go&quot;. One of Clayton&#x27;s most recognisable basslines is from &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, which was borne out of an attempt to play Visage&#x27;s song &quot;Fade to Grey&quot;.

Clayton has sung on some occasions, including on the song &quot;Endless Deep&quot;, the B-side to the single &quot;Two Hearts Beat as One&quot; from 1983. Clayton also sang backup vocals on &quot;I Will Follow&quot;, &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot; and also on some occasions on &quot;With or Without You&quot; and &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; during live performances. He also spoke the last verse of &quot;Your Blue Room&quot;. Clayton can be heard speaking on &quot;Tomorrow (&#x27;96 Version)&quot; (a rerecording of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; that he arranged) a song from U2&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;October&quot;. He plays the guitar on a few occasions, most notably the song &quot;40&quot;, where he and guitarist the Edge switch instruments. He also plays the keyboards on &quot;City of Blinding Lights&quot; and &quot;Iris (Hold Me Close)&quot;.

==Musical equipment ==

Clayton&#x27;s first bass was a walnut brown Ibanez Musician, which he played heavily from the recording of &quot;Boy&quot; and well through the &quot;War&quot; era. Two years later, at 16, Clayton asked his father Brian to purchase a second-hand Precision for him when Brian travelled to New York, as he felt he needed a better guitar to master the instrument. For the rest of his career, he has mainly been known for using various Fender Precision and Jazz basses. Clayton&#x27;s Precision basses have been modified with a Fender Jazz neck. In an interview with &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine, he said that he prefers the Jazz bass neck because it is more &quot;lady-like&quot; and is a better fit in his left hand.

In 2011, the Fender Custom Shop produced a limited-edition signature Precision Bass built to Clayton&#x27;s own specifications in a limited run of 60 pieces, featuring an alder body and a gold sparkle finish. In 2014, Fender announced a signature Adam Clayton Jazz Bass guitar, modelled after a Sherwood Green 1965 Jazz Bass he played during the 2001 Elevation Tour. In 2023, Fender unveiled a signature model of bass guitar amplifier designed in collaboration with Clayton, the ACB 50. It is a 50-watt, all-tube combo amplifier that emphasises mid-range distortion.

==Personal life==
Clayton served as the best man in Bono&#x27;s wedding to Alison Hewson (née Stewart) in 1982. He became a naturalised citizen of the Republic of Ireland in 1989, whilst also retaining his British citizenship.
Clayton made the news in August 1989 when he was arrested in Dublin for carrying a small amount of marijuana. However, he avoided conviction by making a large donation to charity, and later commented: &quot;it was my own fault. And I&#x27;m sure I was out of my head – emotionally apart from anything else. But it is serious because it is illegal.&quot; Clayton has also had alcohol problems, which came to a head during the Zoo TV Tour. On 26 November 1993, he was so hung over that he was unable to play that night&#x27;s show in Sydney, the dress rehearsal for their Zoo TV concert film. Bass duties had to be fulfilled by Clayton&#x27;s technician Stuart Morgan. After that incident, he resolved to give up alcohol, eventually beginning his sobriety in 1996. On 26 June 2017, Clayton received the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award at the MusiCares 13th annual MAP Fund Benefit Concert in recognition of his commitment to helping others with addiction recovery.

Clayton remained a bachelor for several decades until his marriage in 2013. During the early 1990s, he dated English supermodel Naomi Campbell. He also had a long-standing relationship with Suzanne &quot;Susie&quot; Smith, a former assistant to Paul McGuinness; they were engaged in 2006, but the pair broke up in February 2007. In 2010, Clayton fathered a son with his then-partner, an unnamed French woman. In 2013, he confirmed that he was no longer in that relationship. On 4 September 2013, Clayton married former human rights lawyer Mariana Teixeira de Carvalho in a ceremony in Dublin. &quot;The Independent&quot; reported in 2015 that de Carvalho, originally from Brazil, works as a director at Michael Werner, a leading contemporary art gallery in London and New York. In 2024, the couple announced their divorce.

In 2009 the High Court ordered the assets of Carol Hawkins, Clayton&#x27;s former housekeeper and personal assistant, be frozen after it was reported that she misappropriated funds of €1.8 million. At the subsequent trial that figure was stated to be €2.8 million. Hawkins denied the charges but in 2012 was convicted by a jury of 181 counts of theft and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.

On 25 July 2017, Clayton and his wife announced the birth of a daughter.

In April 2024, Clayton was featured in an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Gardeners&#x27; World&quot;, showing his collection of camellia, magnolia and rhododendron at his Dublin home, to interviewer Adam Frost. Clayton will also be a presenter on the television programme &quot;Ballroom Blitz&quot;, which was commissioned by RTÉ and will explore the history of Irish showbands.

==Charity work==
In 2011 Clayton became an ambassador for the Dublin-based St Patrick&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s Mental Health Service &quot;Walk in My Shoes&quot; facility.

==Awards and recognition==
Clayton and U2 have won, among many other honours, 22 Grammy awards, including Best Rock Duo or Group seven times, Album of the Year twice, Record of the Year twice, Song of the Year twice, and Best Rock Album twice. In March 2005, Clayton was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of U2, in their first year of eligibility.

<text>Paxton is a village in Keith County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 523 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Paxton, Nebraska, originally known as Alkali, owes its early existence to the construction of the first Transcontinental Railroad in the late 1860s. The town&#x27;s name reflected the high alkaline content of the soil in the area. This small but resilient community began as a simple siding along the Union Pacific Railroad, complete with a telegraph station, water tower, and depot. Its roots trace back to Edwin Searle Sr., an 18-year-old telegraph operator who arrived in 1867. Living initially in a tent, Searle quickly became a notable figure in the settlement&#x27;s early days, and his son, Edwin Searle Jr., born in 1873, holds the distinction of being the first white child born in Keith County.

Before the siding became Alkali, the surrounding area hosted Fort Alkali, a small fortress protecting Oregon Trail settlers and later railroad workers. Alkali’s transformation began as settlers arrived in the 1870s, following the extermination of buffalo herds and the rise of ranching. William A. Paxton, a prominent Omaha rancher and businessman, acquired significant land in the area, alongside other figures like John Bratt and Morrell Keith. Paxton, whose entrepreneurial ventures stretched from cattle ranching to banking and ironworks, eventually became the namesake of the community when Alkali was renamed Paxton in 1885.

By the 1880s, abundant rainfall encouraged settlement. Pioneers like Ann LeDioyt, who filed the first homestead claim, and the Lawler family, who brought cattle to the area, established the foundations of a thriving agricultural community. The village of Paxton incorporated in 1885 and began expanding its infrastructure with the construction of bridges, a school, and a growing array of businesses.

The 1890s were a time of both prosperity and hardship. Despite a severe drought and economic recession, Paxton remained resilient. Its Bank of Paxton was the last financial institution in Keith County to close during the downturn. Social and cultural growth accompanied economic endeavors. Churches, such as Methodist (1886) and Catholic (1887), sprang up, and The Globe Hotel, run by the Stafford family, became a hub for railroad workers and visitors. 

The town&#x27;s economy received a boost in the early 20th century with the construction of the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental road in the United States, which passed through Paxton. Paxton also embraced modernity with a municipal light plant, though its initial limitations (shutting off at 10 p.m.) sparked frustration among residents.

The 1930s brought the dual pressures of the Great Depression and agricultural challenges, but Paxton adapted. The construction of Kingsley Dam and the development of supplemental water systems revitalized the local economy. The town also gained cultural significance with the opening of Ole&#x27;s Tavern in 1933, a business that became a lasting community centerpiece.

Today, Paxton is a small but enduring community with a population of around 500. Its history reflects the indomitable spirit of the American West, shaped by pioneers, ranchers, and entrepreneurs who turned a humble railroad siding into a vibrant town.

<text>Henry Norris Russell ForMemRS HFRSE FRAS (October 25, 1877 – February 18, 1957) was an American astronomer who, along with Ejnar Hertzsprung, developed the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (1910). In 1923, working with Frederick Saunders, he developed Russell–Saunders coupling, which is also known as LS coupling.

==Life==
Russell was born on 25 October 1877, at Oyster Bay, New York, the son of Rev Alexander Gatherer Russell (1845-1911) and his wife, Eliza Hoxie Norris.

After graduating from George School in 1895, he studied astronomy at Princeton University, obtaining his B.A. In 1897 and his doctorate in 1899, studying under Charles Augustus Young. From 1903 to 1905, he worked at the Cambridge Observatory with Arthur Robert Hinks as a research assistant of the Carnegie Institution and came under the strong influence of George Darwin.

He returned to Princeton to become an instructor in astronomy (1905–1908), assistant professor (1908–1911), professor (1911–1927) and research professor (1927–1947). He was also the director of the Princeton University Observatory from 1912 to 1947 where Charlotte Moore Sitterly helped him measure and calculate the properties of stars.

He died in Princeton, New Jersey on 18 February 1957 at the age of 79. He is buried in Princeton Cemetery.
==Family==

In November 1908 Russell married Lucy May Cole (1881-1968). They had four children. Their youngest daughter, Margaret Russell (1914-1999), married the astronomer Frank K. Edmondson in the 1930s.

==Published work==
Russell co-wrote an influential two-volume textbook in 1927 with Raymond Smith Dugan and John Quincy Stewart: &quot;Astronomy: A Revision of Young’s Manual of Astronomy&quot; (Ginn &amp; Co., Boston, 1926–27, 1938, 1945). This became the standard astronomy textbook for about two decades. There were two volumes: the first was &quot;The Solar System&quot; and the second was &quot;Astrophysics and Stellar Astronomy&quot;. The textbook popularized the idea that a star&#x27;s properties (radius, surface temperature, luminosity, etc.)
were largely determined by the star&#x27;s mass and chemical composition, which became known as the Vogt–Russell theorem
(including Heinrich Vogt who independently discovered the result). Since a star&#x27;s chemical composition 
gradually changes with age (usually in a non-homogeneous fashion), stellar evolution results.

Russell dissuaded Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin from concluding that the composition of the Sun is different from that of the Earth in her thesis, as it contradicted the accepted wisdom at the time. He realized she was correct four years later after deriving the same result by different means. In his paper Russell credited Payne with discovering that the Sun had a different chemical composition from Earth but never shared the rewards of the fame he readily accepted for her work which he’d failed to recognize until years later.

<doc id="124024" wikidata="Q814065" url="?curid=124024" title="Larry Mullen Jr.">
<text>Laurence Joseph Mullen Jr. (; born 31 October 1961) is an Irish musician, best known as the drummer and co-founder of the rock band U2. A member of the band since its inception, he has recorded 15 studio albums with U2. Mullen&#x27;s distinctive, almost military drumming style developed from his playing martial beats in childhood marching bands.

Mullen was born in Dublin, where he attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School. In 1976, he co-founded U2 after posting a message on the school&#x27;s notice board in search of musicians. Mullen has worked on numerous side projects during his career. In 1990, he produced the Ireland national football team&#x27;s song &quot;Put &#x27;Em Under Pressure&quot; for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. In 1996, he worked with U2 bandmate Adam Clayton on a dance re-recording of the &quot;Theme from &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;&quot;. He has also collaborated with musicians such as Maria McKee, Nanci Griffith, Emmylou Harris, and Alice Cooper. Mullen has sporadically acted in films, most notably in &quot;Man on the Train&quot; (2011) and &quot;A Thousand Times Good Night&quot; (2013).

Mullen has received 22 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Mullen the 96th-greatest drummer of all time.

==Early life==
Laurence Joseph Mullen Jr., the middle child and only son of Laurence Joseph Mullen Sr. and Maureen (née Boyd) Mullen, was born on 31 October 1961 in Artane, Dublin, Ireland, and lived there, on Rosemount Avenue, until his twenties. His father was a civil servant and his mother a homemaker. He has an elder sister, Cecilia, and had a younger sister, Mary, who died in 1973. He attended the School of Music in Chatham Row to learn piano at the age of eight and then began drumming in 1971 at the age of 9, under the instruction of Irish drummer Joe Bonnie. After Bonnie&#x27;s death, his daughter Monica took over for him, but Mullen gave up the lessons and started playing by himself.

Before founding U2, Mullen joined a Dublin marching band called the Artane Boys Band at the suggestion of his father. Mullen said that the band focused more on learning to read sheet music, whereas he wanted to spend more time playing the drums. He was asked by the band to cut his shoulder-length hair, and despite acquiescing and cutting a few inches off, he was asked to shorten it further. Mullen refused and quit the band after just three weeks.

Mullen used the money he had saved and with his father&#x27;s help bought a drum kit, made by a Japanese toy company, which his sister Cecilia&#x27;s friend was selling. He set up the kit in his bedroom and his parents allotted him certain times to practice. His father then got him into the Post Office Workers Band, which played orchestral melodies with percussion, along with marching band standards. Mullen spent approximately two years in the Post Office Workers Band, overlapping with his time in U2. He attended Scoil Colmcille, Marlborough Street, Dublin. He took the exams for Chanel College and St. Paul&#x27;s, two Catholic schools his father wanted his son to attend. After the accidental death of Larry&#x27;s younger sister in 1973, his father gave up the idea of pushing his son into those schools and sent Larry to Mount Temple Comprehensive School, the first interdenominational school in Ireland. His mother died in a car accident in November 1978.

==Musical career==
===U2===
Mullen&#x27;s father suggested that he place a notice on the Mount Temple bulletin board, saying something to the effect of &quot;drummer seeks musicians to form band&quot;. U2 was founded on 25 September 1976 in Mullen&#x27;s kitchen in Artane. Attending the first meeting were Mullen, Paul &quot;Bono&quot; Hewson, David &quot;The Edge&quot; Evans and his brother Dik, Adam Clayton, and Mullen&#x27;s friends Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin. Mullen later described it as &quot;&#x27;The Larry Mullen Band&#x27; for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge.&quot; McCormick and Martin soon left, and the group settled on the name &quot;Feedback&quot; because it was one of the few technical terms they knew. The band later changed their name to &quot;The Hype&quot;, and again to &quot;U2&quot; for a 1978 talent contest in Limerick, Ireland, that they entered and won as a four-piece. Days after the competition, the band&#x27;s reduction to a four-piece lineup became permanent after they parted ways with Dik.

Mullen left school in 1978, having taken his Intermediate Certificate exams. The school offered him the chance to complete his Leaving Certificate exams. He and his sister Cecilia worked for an American company in Dublin, involved in oil exploration off the coast of Ireland. Mullen worked there for a year in the purchasing department, with the prospect of becoming a computer programmer in their geology section.

During the recording of the album &quot;Pop&quot; in 1996, Mullen suffered from severe back problems. Recording was delayed due to surgery. When he left the hospital, he arrived back in the studio to find the rest of the band experimenting more than ever with electronic drum machines, something driven largely by the Edge&#x27;s interest in dance and hip-hop music, and, given his weakness after the operation, he relented, allowing The Edge to continue using drum machines, which contributed heavily to the album&#x27;s electronic feel.

In order to recuperate from surgery, Mullen did not perform during U2&#x27;s concert residency U2:UV &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; Live at Sphere, which ran for 40 shows from September 2023 to March 2024 at Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley. Dutch drummer Bram van den Berg from the band Krezip filled in for him. It was the first time that Mullen missed a U2 show since 1978, when he broke his foot in a motorcycle accident.

===Other projects===

Mullen has worked on many musical projects outside of U2 in his career, including collaborations with Maria McKee. Mullen contributed to U2 producer Daniel Lanois&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Acadie&quot;. In 1990, Mullen co-wrote and arranged an official Ireland national team song &quot;Put &#x27;Em Under Pressure&quot; for the FIFA World Cup. He and Clayton collaborated with Mike Mills and Michael Stipe from R.E.M. to form the one-performance group Automatic Baby, solely for the purpose of performing &quot;One&quot; for MTV&#x27;s 1993 inauguration ball for US President Bill Clinton; the group&#x27;s name refers to the titles of both latest bands&#x27; albums at the time, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and &quot;Automatic for the People&quot;. For Nanci Griffith&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Flyer&quot;, he and Clayton performed in the rhythm section on several songs, while Mullen also mixed three songs. Mullen played drums on many of the songs on Emmylou Harris&#x27; 1995 album &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;.

Mullen and Clayton contributed to of the 1996 film &quot;&quot;, which included reworking the &quot;Theme from &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;&quot;, whose time signature was changed from the original time signature to an easier and more danceable time signature. The song reached number 8 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1997.

Mullen performed on Underworld&#x27;s song &quot;Boy, Boy, Boy&quot; from their 2007 album, &quot;Oblivion with Bells&quot;. In 2017, he appeared on Alice Cooper&#x27;s album &quot;Paranormal&quot;.

Mullen has played synthesiser or keyboards on several songs, including &quot;United Colours&quot; from Passengers&#x27; 1995 album &quot;Original Soundtracks 1&quot;, an album that Mullen has always disliked.

==Musical style and techniques==

Mullen&#x27;s drumming style is influenced by his experience in marching bands during his adolescence, which helped contribute to the militaristic beats of songs such as &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;. Author Bill Flanagan said that he plays &quot;with a martial rigidity but uses his kit in a way a properly trained drummer would not&quot;; he tends to transition from the snare drum onto tom-toms positioned on either side of him, contrasting with how they are traditionally used. Mullen occasionally rides a tom-tom the way other drummers would play a cymbal, or rides the hi-hat how others would play a snare. He admitted his bass drum technique is not a strength, as he mostly played the snare in marching bands and did not learn to properly combine the separate elements together on a full kit. As a result, he uses a floor tom to his left to create the effect of a bass drum, an arrangement he began to use while recording &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; in 1984 at the influence of producer Daniel Lanois. He said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives.&quot; Flanagan said that his playing style perfectly reflects his personality: &quot;Larry is right on top of the beat, a bit ahead—as you&#x27;d expect from a man who&#x27;s so ordered and punctual in his life.

Mullen was heavily influenced by glam rock acts of the 1970s when first learning to play drums. In the early days of U2, he had what Bono called a &quot;florid&quot; drumming style, before he eventually adopted a philosophy of simplicity and pared down his rhythms. His drumming leaves open space, owing to what &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; described as his understanding of &quot;when to hit and when not to hit&quot;. As he matured as a timekeeper, he developed a preternatural sense of rhythm; Eno recounted one occasion when Mullen noticed that his click track had been set incorrectly by just six milliseconds. Under the tutelage of Lanois, Mullen learned more about his musical role as the drummer in filling out the band&#x27;s sound, while producer Flood helped Mullen learn to play along with electronic elements such as drum machines and samples. His kit has a tambourine mounted on a cymbal stand, which he uses as an accent on certain beats for songs such as &quot;With or Without You&quot;.
Mullen has had tendinitis problems throughout his career. As a means to reduce inflammation and pain, he began to use specially designed Pro-Mark drumsticks. He uses Yamaha drums and Paiste cymbals. Although he occasionally plays keyboards and synthesiser in concerts, Mullen rarely sings during performances. He contributed backing vocals to the songs &quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;Get On Your Boots&quot;, &quot;Moment of Surrender&quot;, &quot;Elevation&quot;, &quot;Miracle Drug&quot;, &quot;Love and Peace or Else&quot;, &quot;Unknown Caller&quot;, &quot;Zoo Station&quot; and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car&quot; (only during Zoo TV Tour), and others. He occasionally performed a cover version of &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; on the Zoo TV Tour. During live performances of &quot;I&#x27;ll Go Crazy If I Don&#x27;t Go Crazy Tonight&quot; on the U2 360° Tour, Mullen walked around the stage, playing a large djembe strapped around his waist.

==Film projects==
Mullen&#x27;s film debut was in a film by Phil Joanou called &quot;Entropy&quot; where he played himself alongside bandmate Bono. He played a thief in &quot;Man on the Train&quot; (2011), which starred Donald Sutherland. Mullen also appeared in &quot;A Thousand Times Goodnight&quot; (2013), starring Juliette Binoche. On 3 September 2013, the film won Special Grand Prix of the Jury at Montreal World Film Festival.

In July 2020, Mullen was invited to join the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.

Mullen co-produced the 2024 documentary film &quot;Left Behind&quot;, which covers efforts by mothers to open the first public school in New York City for dyslexic children. Mullen, whose son is dyslexic, also contributed two songs to the project: &quot;Between the Lines&quot;, co-written by Reed Berin, David Baron, and Gayle; and &quot;One of Us&quot;, co-written by Baron and sung by Donna Lewis.

==Personal life==
Mullen met his partner, Ann Acheson, in their first year at Mount Temple Comprehensive School. The two have been together for over 40 years and they have three children. He is a first cousin of Irish actor Conor Mullen.

As U2 became increasingly successful, Larry Mullen had to add the suffix &quot;Junior&quot; to his surname to avoid confusion with his father, who was receiving large tax bills meant for his son. Mullen and Clayton own houses near Bono and the Edge in Southern France to make it easier to record with U2 in the area.

In 1995, Mullen had surgery on his back to address an injury he had been carrying since The Joshua Tree Tour. In 2009, Mullen underwent knee surgery, an operation that was performed by Richard Steadman. Mullen subsequently joined the board of directors for his foundation, the Steadman Philippon Research Institute.

In December 2024, Mullen revealed that he has dyscalculia, affecting his ability to add and count numbers. He compared counting musical bars to &quot;climbing Everest&quot; and said that it is the reason for his pained expression while performing.

<text>Dix is a village in Kimball County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 187 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Originally a siding on the Union Pacific Railroad, Dix was founded as a settlement in 1886. The community derives its name from Dixon, Illinois, the former home of an early settler. However, it was deemed necessary to shorten the name to &quot;Dix&quot;, in order to avoid repetition with Dixon. State highway 30 runs through Dix, and in 1995 was changed from &quot;Main&quot; street to &quot;Miller&quot; street (within the city limits of Dix). This was done in honor of Fred H. Miller, who worked for the Union Pacific for 30 years and ran the town&#x27;s train depot. The train depot was dismantled after Fred&#x27;s retirement. Fred also served on the town board, and lived two blocks away from the depot next to the city park with his wife Ada B. Miller. Their memorial stone is located in the graveyard south of town, near Interstate 80.

The fall season is drier than the spring and gradually cools down, although warm spells due to the chinook are always possible.

<text>Creighton is a city in Knox County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 1,154 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The City of Creighton developed as a result of the “Bruce Colony” settlement in 1871. A charter was obtained in 1874 to plat the north side of what is now the mile-long Main Street. Some say the town was named for Edward Creighton, while others claim it was for John, for whom Creighton University was named. The most plausible explanation is “the Creighton family of Omaha.”

In those early years, food staples and supplies were brought in by wagon from Yankton or West Point, being transported mainly during the winter so the rivers might be crossed while frozen. When the railroad arrived in 1881, insuring the existence of Creighton, it resulted in the near-demise of Bazile Mills to the north.

The next year Main Street was widened, additions were made to the original town, and formal incorporation papers were filed. Dr. George Roberts established a medical center that continued until 1920. After 33 years without a hospital, the Lundberg family and other concerned citizens built a modern hospital in 1953 that serves as the only hospital in Knox County. Many tales of bravery and human endurance arose from the catastrophic blizzard of 1888. More recently the winter of 1948–49, starting with a blizzard in November, brought a resignation to weather&#x27;s importance in northeast Nebraska.

A newspaper started in 1889, the year a fire destroyed an entire block of the business district. This prompted the installation of a unique system that took water directly from Bazile Creek and stored it in a wooden tower to be used for fire protection. In 1894 a volunteer fire department was organized and today it still protects the city with one of the best-equipped units for its size. The first electric service was operated by Fred Largen and Andy Schneider in 1890. Later, Largen started making items such as motion picture projectors, irrigation sprinkler nozzles, and deep fryers. Creighton Bottling Works, also started making soda pop. In 1899 telephone service was installed by M.C. Theisen and Mr. Diehl. Northwestern Bell built long-distance lines from Norfolk.

Creighton became a second class city in 1907, the same year a two-story brick school was built in the south part of town. Domestic water was a problem until 1913, when a new water system was installed. A public library, built in 1914, was replaced in the 1960s by one donated by the Hengstler family. A municipal hall, built in 1916, is still in use for city offices and many public functions. With the war-to-end-all-wars over, the town experienced much growth. Electrical power was received from Interstate Power System in 1923. This system is now part of NPPD, with headquarters built in Creighton in 1960.

Bank and business failures were typical in the 1930s. The Bank of Creighton was one of the last in the county to close, and after reorganizing, it paid depositors nearly 100 percent. 

Expansion followed as rural electrification became a reality, and new businesses and homes were built. The 1950s saw the end of passenger service on the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway, but natural gas service became available. The city started a program to hard-surface the streets, and a modern swimming pool was built. In the 1960s school consolidation was successfully completed and a new high school was dedicated in 1962.

The town continued to grow, with its highest population, 1,461, registered in 1970. Expansion was needed in the water supply, hospital, and streets. An important milestone was Creighton&#x27;s centennial, with a full week of celebration, parades, a pageant, and all kinds of entertainment for area residents. Since agriculture is the main industry, Creighton experiences fluctuations in its economy along with the rural area.

In 1882 Theodore T. Thorson was the first resident. He named the town Thorson, Nebraska. He also became its first postmaster, and resided in the town&#x27;s post office. He was returning from a five-month journey over the West Coast, Montana and Wyoming, in search of a good location for stock raising.

Mr. Thorson returned to Minnesota and in the following spring married and returned to Nebraska with his bride. He leased of land, built a sod house, and started a sheep ranch consisting of 115 sheep. Families immigrating from Sweden began to arrive and Thorson was appointed land agent. At this time, Creighton, Nebraska had the nearest railroad station. A pony express was started by a man with the name Campbell. He made three trips a week from their town to Creighton. 

By 1885, 12 new families had moved to the settlement and it was decided that they would change the name to &quot;Vasa&quot; in honor of the Swedish king Gustav Wasa. The railroad came through Vasa on November 27, 1890. At this time, the name was changed to Wausa, a combination of the name of the dynasty Vasa founded and the letters USA. In the fall of 1891, a community water well was created. It was deep and cost $40. The first water system was installed in 1903, and a complete sewer system was constructed in 1916. The Waste Water Treatment Facility was built in 1985.

<doc id="124040" wikidata="Q1943608" url="?curid=124040" title="Bennet, Nebraska">
<text>Bennet is a city in Lancaster County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Lincoln, Nebraska Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,082 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Bennet was founded on July 29, 1871 when the railroad was extended to that point. The village was founded on land previously owned by William Roggenkamp as a station for a rail line being laid by the Midland Pacific Railway which ran from Lincoln to Nebraska City. It was originally named Bennett&#x27;s Station for John Bennett, officer of the Midland Pacific Railway. The town was incorporated on October 1, 1881.

By the early 1900s, the village had become a prosperous commercial and social center for the area. At this time, the nearby town of Lincoln was still relatively small and remote. Beginning with the Great Depression, Bennet&#x27;s population declined, local businesses closed, and many moved to cities for work.

Today, Bennet has a similar status as many former business centers in Lancaster County as Lincoln has become the political, financial, commercial, and cultural center of the county. However, Bennet has experienced a recent population growth as more and more people have begun living in Bennet despite working in Lincoln. According to a community-wide survey conducted in 1992, 76% of Bennet&#x27;s residents commute to work in Lincoln. A recent survey indicated that 44% of people who moved to Bennet did so because of the small town atmosphere, citing a lower cost of living, cleaner air, and a good school system.

The area was originally known as Rock Creek and was served by a Pony Express station in 1871. In 1875, a Danish Lutheran church was built in the area. The town of Davey was founded in the Rock Creek area in 1886 when the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad was extended to that point and was named for Michael Davey, a pioneer citizen.

By 1891, Davey offered a livery barn, an ice house, a meat market, a barber shop, a two-story opera house, a doctor&#x27;s office, and a confectioner&#x27;s shop. In 1900, the Interstate Company of Lincoln began publishing the Davey Mirror, the village newspaper. In 1903, the Farmers State Bank of Davey opened its doors in the center of the village.

A fire broke out at the local Catholic church in 1919 which spread throughout the town, burning many buildings including the Farmers State Bank of Davey and the telephone office. The Davey Hall, a WPA project, was built in the 1930s and celebrated by two days of festivities. The only grocery store in Davey, Hansen&#x27;s Grocery, closed in 1965 and the last Chicago Northwestern train passed through the village in 1981. Today, the train tracks have been converted to a hiking trail.

==Schools==

Norris School District 160 is located approximately two miles north and one mile west of Firth. Norris is made up of an elementary school, intermediate school, middle school, and a high school, all of which are in separate buildings but on the same campus. Norris provides Pre-K-12 education for students from Hickman, Holland, Firth, Cortland, Roca, Princeton, Panama, and parts of southern Lincoln. Norris School was named after a United States senator from Nebraska, George William Norris.

==History==
A courthouse square was planned in the area that would become Firth sometime before 1860. However, due to Firth&#x27;s remote location, residents would have had to travel to Nebraska City for supplies, meaning that the area remained largely uninhabited by non-Natives for many years. Firth was settled in the early 1870s, as the Atchison &amp; Nebraska Railroad was extended toward Lincoln. The post office was established in 1872, named for Superintendent Frank Firth of the Atchison &amp; Nebraska Railroad, and was incorporated in 1879.

Once the railroad was completed, Firth became an important hub of business on the Atchison &amp; Nebraska line, shipping 700 carloads of grain and livestock daily. In 1916, a brick school was built to replace the two-story schoolhouse which had previously served the village. In 1964, Firth became one of several schools to consolidate and form the Norris School District. The brick school building was torn down in 1971 after years of vacancy. Fundraising in the area allowed for the Lakeview Rest Home to be built in the 1970s on land donated by Henry and Bertha TeKolste.

==Notable person==

Orah Dee Clark, the first superintendent of Alaska schools, was born in Firth.

<text>Hallam is a village in Lancaster County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Lincoln, Nebraska Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 268 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Hallam was platted in 1892 when the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad was extended to that point. The land was sold by Frederick Schneider, who was asked to name the village. However, Schneider&#x27;s proposals were already names of towns in Nebraska, so the first landowner in the village, Jacob Schadd, was given the honor of naming the settlement. Schadd suggested Hallau, after his hometown in Switzerland. However, due to a transcription error at the post office, the name was recorded as Hallam rather than Hallau, similar to the error which altered Norfork, Nebraska, to Norfolk, Nebraska.

Mrs. Maggie Classen owned several lots in Hallam, unusual for a woman in the 1890s, upon which were built the telephone office and a doctor&#x27;s office. By the early 1900s, Hallam featured a bank, a hardware store, a dry goods store, a shoe shop, a druggist, a livery barn, and a doctor.

In 1962, the second nuclear power plant in the United States was completed in Hallam. However, the plant only produced nuclear power for approximately one year before being converted to coal power.

=== 2004 tornado ===
On May 22, 2004, Hallam was struck by an F4 tornado, which killed one person, injured nearly 40 more, and destroyed most of the town. The tornado&#x27;s path was wide, making it the widest tornado on record at the time. That record was broken on May 31, 2013, by the 2.6 mile-wide EF3 wedge tornado that hit El Reno, Oklahoma.

<text>Panama is a village in Lancaster County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Lincoln, Nebraska Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 235 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1879, the Panama Cemetery Association was formed and raised funds to dig a well. Panama was originally founded one mile south of its present location but was moved in order to be closer to the railway. In 1888, the village was officially founded on land that was previously owned by Moses J. Mitton, John Forrest, and Gilbert F. Steeves. According to local folk history, the village&#x27;s original by-laws contained a clause inserted by a descendant of Gilbert F. Steeves, Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; Steeves, which stated that if the village allowed any business to sell alcohol in the village, the Steeves family would reclaim the land they had deeded to the village. Panama was incorporated as a village in 1904. New by-laws and ordinances were enacted when the village was incorporated and again in 1977, but it is still illegal to sell alcohol in the village. The village was likely named after the Isthmus of Panama, which had gained notoriety at the time due to the United States&#x27; involvement in building the Panama Canal.

<text>Raymond is a village in Lancaster County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Lincoln, Nebraska Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 159 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Beginning in 1864, settlers arrived in the area and a subscription school was run in the home of Charles and Olive White. In 1870, Oak Creek was dammed and a grist mill was erected. A population grew in the area, generally centered around Raymond&#x27;s present location, but there was no official settlement or name of the area. In 1878, a post office was established nearby and named &quot;Orlando.&quot; Raymond was platted in 1880 when the railroad was extended to that point and was named for I. M. Raymond, a railroad official.

In 1892, Raymond became incorporated as a village and one year later a two-room school was built. Following consolidation with several neighboring school districts, a new high school was built near Agnew, Nebraska, but elementary school students still attend school in Raymond.

The twentieth century created challenges for Raymond. As automobiles became the way to travel cross-country in the United States, Raymond was left disconnected as Highway 79 passed one half mile west of the town rather than through it. World War II saw the building of the Lincoln Air Base and increasing numbers of factory jobs elsewhere, leaving Raymond behind.

However, Raymond experienced a period of growth following the construction of Branched Oak Dam in 1970. The dam provided flood relief for the village, but also created a large reservoir surrounded by the largest recreational area in eastern Nebraska.

==History==

The population of Roca in 1890 was 190, the highest it has been before the present day. The post office was established September 22, 1894. When the town was platted in 1876, the citizens wished to choose a name, which would suggest the chief industry in the area, stone quarrying. Roca is the Spanish word for stone.

In 1857 John and Margaret Prey, adult sons, John W., Thomas, and William, and teenage children, David and Rebecca, came from Wisconsin to preempt land near the proposed town called &quot;Olathe.&quot; There were high hopes for the future of the area, which was designated as &quot;Clay County.&quot; However, not many people ventured this far onto the prairie. While there were no major confrontations with Indians, there were several scares, which caused some settlers to leave and not return. Indians took Rebecca Prey, but they released her when her father and brothers appeared.

In 1861 Delos and Frances Mills settled one-half mile west of Salt Creek. They built a small stone house, using limestone from a ledge that protruded from the ground. This was the beginning of the quarries that became a primary business. The following year Mills&#x27; mother, Orra Boydston, and her sister, Esther Warner arrived. Both widows, they filed on adjoining homesteads near Mills&#x27; cabin.

There was a &quot;political altercation&quot; in 1863, at which time Clay County was dissolved and the land divided between Gage and Lancaster counties. The Prey family and John Haskins were the only original settlers who remained at this location. In 1864 Elmore Keys arrived and bought Prey&#x27;s cabin for $20. He moved it, log by log, to a site on the east side of the creek and later added a small stone lean-to.

In 1867 a committee was commissioned to find a location for the state&#x27;s capital city. A site near the rock quarries on the Mills farm was suggested because of the availability of good building materials. However, the town of Lancaster was chosen instead. When work was started on the statehouse in 1868, rock from the quarry was said to be &quot;unsatisfactory for building.&quot;

The quarry men built a school in 1869 near the Warner farm. When the Atchinson &amp; Nebraska Railroad built its line to Lincoln in 1871, it came right through the area. The siding and station established at that time needed a name. Haskel Warner, who had worked with a survey crew in the New Mexico Territory, suggested &quot;Roca,&quot; which is Spanish for rock.

Elmore Keys and John Meyer donated the land, and a town site was platted. The big stone house that Keys built on top of the hill east of the town at that time is still a fine home today. The town immediately started to grow, and 1876 incorporated it.

Keys &amp; Bullock opened a new quarry on the south side of Roca in 1875, and later called it the Blue Stone quarry. Rock from these quarries was used in the construction of many buildings in Lincoln, out-state, and beyond. There was active quarrying in the area for over 100 years, both by the county and by private owners. In 1879 the number of students had grown so that another schoolhouse was needed. That one also was quickly outgrown, so a larger wooden building was erected. By 1882 there were 280 students and businesses included a motel, a mill, a hardware store, a lumberyard, and a few other shops. Main Street faced Salt Creek on the West Side of town, with the Railroad depot across the street.

Fires destroyed several businesses in 1891, the mill in about 1900, and the hotel in 1910. By then the quarries were not as productive. Businesses, once displaced, did not rebuild. In 1933 a large brick schoolhouse was built, which served the community until 1964 when a Consolidation effort formed the Norris School District with a building south of Hickman.

A Methodist church formed in 1876 was built by quarry men, and enlarged in 1925. That evidence burned in an early morning fire in 1969. A new church was built which was a small but active congregation. A small Lutheran church located near the school was active until 1916 when it disbanded. The original cemetery was one mile north of town on a sand hill. In 1876 the present cemetery was established on land donated by the Keys family; an enlargement of their family burial grounds. The &quot;old stone store&quot; was built from quarry rock as a blacksmith shop in 1879. It has been a lodge, community hall, and a grocery store, with an apartment upstairs.

<text>Sprague is a village in Lancaster County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Lincoln, Nebraska Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 136 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1865, a settlement called Centerville established a post office in the area, but never grew into a sustainable community. Sprague was established in 1888 when the Missouri Pacific Railroad was extended to that point and was named after a local Civil War veteran, William Sprague, and his wife, Amy. In 1894, a station named &quot;Martell&quot; was established and platted by the Rock Island Railroad nearby, but the village was never incorporated. Sprague was incorporated in 1913, when it was no longer required there be a population of at least 200 people.

In 1912 and again in 1927, fires broke out and burned down much of the business sector of Sprague. In 1963, the Bluestem Conservation Dam was built in the area, creating a 325-acre lake. A conservation area was created around Bluestem Lake, creating 742 acres of recreational area. The lake increased numbers of retirement communities and recreational homes in the area, though it remains primarily rural and agricultural.

<doc id="124057" wikidata="Q2177405" url="?curid=124057" title="Hershey, Nebraska">
<text>Hershey is a village in Lincoln County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the North Platte, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 665 at the 2010 census.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
Hershey was established as a station on the Union Pacific Railroad. It was named for J. H. Hershey, a pioneer settler. The locations of the pre-existing O&#x27;Fallon&#x27;s and Nichol&#x27;s Stations are shown on an 1884 map of Lincoln County. An 1894 map shows the Hershey Station, to the west of Nichol&#x27;s Station. The original town—consisting of 24 lots laid out in two square blocks—was platted on February 5, 1892, by Annie S. Guthrie.

=== Hershey in 1900 ===
By 1900, Hershey had about 20 resident families and a population of 80. This included a blacksmith (Alfred Leister), two merchants (Joseph Strickler and Martin Mickelsen), a lumberman (Weston Hill), a liveryman (Horace Stone), a doctor (William Eves), a postmaster (John Pricket), a minister (William Evans), and two railroad foremen. There were about 64 farm families (including laborers working for others) in the surrounding Nichols Precinct. Most families were of American origin, although there were five German families, and one or two each of Swedish, French, Scottish, Dutch, Bohemian and Canadian background. The village was incorporated in April 1909.

=== From 1900 to 1920 ===
Between 1900 and 1920, Hershey grew rapidly and added the structural foundation, commercial attractions, and social amenities of an important economic center for the surrounding area.  A local newspaper, the &quot;Hershey Times&quot;, began publication in 1911.  In 1913, a bond issue was approved providing for public water and electric lights.  A telephone exchange was introduced in 1914.  Businesses in Hershey in 1920, in addition to those present in 1900, included two mills (one of which, an alfalfa mill, burned in March 1920), two elevators, a hotel, two banks, three agricultural implement dealers, a cement works, an automobile dealer, a garage, a tire store, a meat market, a drug store, a restaurant, a number of dealers in agricultural products, including stock and hay, a barber, and an Opera House.  There were three churches, the Methodist, Presbyterian (54 members), and Lutheran (40 members), and a number of fraternal organizations, including the Odd Fellows (63 members), Yeomanry (39 members), Modern Woodmen of the World, Royal Neighbors and Mystic Legion.

=== Agricultural context ===
Hershey is located between the North and South Platte rivers in the midst of good agricultural land, much of it irrigated.  From an early date, agricultural production emphasized stock raising, alfalfa, and sugar beets. The sugar beet industry was encouraged by a tariff on sugar enacted in 1897. In 1905, there were 721 acres in Nicols Precinct planted to sugar beets. Shipments from Hershey in 1919 included 904 rail carloads of hay and 279 carloads of sugar beets.  While the sugar content of the beets raised near Hershey was high, the volume was long insufficient to support a processing plant.

=== Further immigration ===
Both the railroad and the sugar beet industries were labor intensive, attracting additional immigrant groups to supply that labor.  These groups included Russian Germans (ethnic Germans from Russia), Japanese and Mexicans.  In 1900, there were three Russian families in the Hershey area (Henry Haff, George Amen, and Conrad Amen), two of whom had become farmers in their own right.  By 1910, there had been a substantial influx of Swedish settlers, most engaged in farming. There were also two households of Japanese men in Nichols Precinct, without wives, one consisting of seven men working for the railroad and one of four men engaged in farming.  By 1920, there were eight Japanese families in Hershey itself, all engaged in farming. The Mexican community repeated the pattern: in 1920, there were three Mexican households in Hershey, including young men working for the railroad. By the late 1920s, there were 19 Mexican families in Hershey.  Both the Japanese and Mexican families were important parts of the community thereafter.

==Geography==
Hershey is located on the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Overland Route.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==History==
In 1859, following complaints of Pawnee depredations against settlers in the Elkhorn River valley, a combined force of Nebraska Territorial Militia under the command of General John Milton Thayer and 2nd U.S. Army Dragoons under Lieutenant Beverly Holcombe Robertson prepared to attack a Pawnee village. Rather than fighting, the Pawnees surrendered before the attack could be launched. Chief Petalesharu draped an American flag over his shoulders and held a peace pipe while confronting the soldiers to stop the fight from taking place,
 ending the Pawnee War of 1859. Although no battle occurred, the nearby stream was dubbed Battle Creek. The town founded in the area in 1867 took the creek&#x27;s name for itself.

<text>Norfolk ( or ) is a city in Madison County, Nebraska, United States, 113 miles northwest of Omaha and 76 miles southwest of Sioux City, Iowa, at the intersection of U.S. Routes 81 and 275. The population was 24,955 at the 2020 census, making it the seventh-most populous city in Nebraska. It is the principal city of the Norfolk Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

===Settlement and early history===
In late 1865 three scouts were sent from a German Lutheran settlement near Ixonia, Wisconsin, to find productive, inexpensive farmland that could be claimed under the Homestead Act. From the Omaha area they followed the Elkhorn River upstream to West Point. Finding that area too crowded, they continued up the river. On September 15, they reached the junction of the Elkhorn and its North Fork, and chose that area as a settlement site. On May 23, 1866, a party of 124 settlers representing 42 families from the Ixonia area set out for northeast Nebraska in three wagon trains. They arrived at the new site on July 15. A second group of settlers from Wisconsin arrived in July 1867. These collective wagon parties established the first church in Madison County, St. Paul&#x27;s Lutheran, which is still operating today.

The original name of the colony was a variant of &quot;North Fork&quot;, but accounts differ on the exact name: &quot;Northfork&quot;, &quot;Nor&#x27;fork&quot;, and &quot;Nordfork&quot; are all suggested. The name was submitted to federal postal authorities, and at some point was transmuted to &quot;Norfolk&quot;. Nebraskans typically pronounce it as &quot;Norfork&quot;.

The North Fork settlement was named the county seat in 1867. In 1875 a series of elections changed this. In the first of these Norfolk, which at the time had 45 voters, was eliminated. In a subsequent election Madison was chosen over Battle Creek.

===Railroads and growth===
The Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad was built after the discovery of gold in the Black Hills in South Dakota. It ran from the Omaha area up the Elkhorn valley, then across northern Nebraska and into South Dakota. Its arrival at Norfolk in 1879 connected the city through Wisner to Blair on the Missouri. The Omaha, Niobrara, and Black Hills branch of the Union Pacific ran north from the railroad&#x27;s main line at Columbus to Norfolk; it reached the city in 1880. The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railroad was completed to Norfolk in 1882.

The development of these railway connections led to significant growth in the city. In 1886 Norfolk&#x27;s population reached 1,000, making it a city of the second class. A street railway system and a public water supply were established in 1887. In 1888 a franchise was granted to the Norfolk Electric Light Company, and the Nebraska Telephone Company was given a right-of-way for &quot;general telegraph and telephone business&quot;.

The Nebraska legislature created the Insane Asylum in Norfolk in 1885; it accepted its first patients in 1888. In 1920, the institution&#x27;s name was changed to the Norfolk State Hospital; in 1962, it became the Norfolk Regional Center. As of 2010, it was a 120-bed institution providing the initial phase of treatment to sex offenders.

===Automobile age===
In 1900, the city had a population of 3,883, nearly quadruple its population of a decade earlier. By 1910, it had more than 6,000 people, comprising roughly one-third of Madison County&#x27;s population of 19,101. In 1915, petitions were filed for an election to move the county seat from Madison to Norfolk. The measure, however, failed to secure the necessary number of votes.

In the 1910s, development began on the Meridian Highway as a direct north–south route across the United States; the route of the highway ran through Norfolk. The 1924 completion of the Meridian Bridge across the Missouri River at the Nebraska-South Dakota border made the highway a continuous year-round thoroughfare. In 1926, it was designated as U.S. Highway 81. A second federal highway, U.S. Highway 275, received its designation in 1939; it follows the Elkhorn valley upstream from Omaha through Norfolk to O&#x27;Neill. During World War II, the segment from Norfolk to O&#x27;Neill was a portion of the Strategic Network of Highways; as such, it was given a high priority for federal funds for materials and for federal maintenance funds.

Air travel developed in Norfolk beginning with the establishment of a flying school in 1928. The school&#x27;s field gradually expanded and was improved. In 1942 the WPA began construction of a municipal airport at the site. Although construction materials were limited during World War II, Norfolk received priority as an auxiliary field to several war-related airports, including Sioux City Air Field. After the war, Congressman Karl Stefan, a resident of Norfolk and a member of the Congressional Air Policy Board, used his influence to secure further funding for the airport. Commercial passenger flight through the airport began in the early 1950s.

In the 1970s, another attempt was made to move the county seat from Madison to Norfolk. In a 1975 county-wide election, the move&#x27;s proponents failed to secure a simple majority. A 60% majority would have been necessary for the measure to pass.

On September 26, 2002, three gunmen robbed a US Bank branch in Norfolk, killing five people in the process. This was the nation&#x27;s deadliest bank robbery in at least a decade. The three gunmen, Jose Sandoval, Jorge Galindo and Erick Vela, were arrested the same day as was their accomplice Gabriel Rodriguez. All four men were later convicted and sentenced for their roles in the crime. Sandoval, Galindo and Vela were given the death penalty, whereas Rodriguez received life imprisonment. Additionally, Sandoval pleaded guilty to two additional murders that occurred before the bank robbery and was given a life sentence for each victim.

<text>Central City is a city and the county seat of Merrick County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Grand Island metropolitan area. The population was 3,039 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early inhabitants===
The inhabitants just prior to the establishment of Lone Tree (Central City) were the Pawnee people. In the late 1700s, the Chaui (Cáwiiʾi) had a village on the current location of Central City. An account that an old Chaui man gave to Major Frank North in 1875 about a battle that took place between two divisions of the Pawnee (the Chaui, Pitahauerit, and Kitkehahki, jointly known as the Southern Pawnee, on one side; and the Skidi on the other) in the late 1700s illustrates the political complexities of the early inhabitants of what would come to be Central City.

There had been considerable rivalry between the Chaui and the Skidi, which eventually led to an unprovoked attack by the Skidi on a group of Chaui hunting buffalo. It was estimated that 200 Chaui were killed. All were men from the Chaui village, which was near Lone Tree and where Central City is now located. The surviving Chaui returned to their village (this was thought to have occurred during winter). The Chaui did not believe they were strong enough to attack the Skidi, so they held councils with two other Southern Pawnee bands and told them what happened. The Pitahauerit and Kitkehahki decided to help the Chaui against the Skidi.

The men of the three villages crossed the Platte River and made a night march to the Skidi village. Some of the men dressed as buffaloes in order to entice the Skidi out of their village to hunt buffalo. The rest of the men hid along the river and behind the ridge of sandhills next to the river. The Skidi charged between the men hiding along the river and behind the sandhill ridge thinking that they were chasing buffalo; the Southern Pawnees attacked them there.
All of the Skidi men who had not gone out to hunt the buffaloes came out of the village and joined buffalo hunters who had initially escaped, preparing to make a last stand. Grinnell&#x27;s Chaui informant estimated that more than 400 Skidi men were killed. The Chaui and the Pitahauerat wanted to exterminate the Skidi, but the Kitkehaki disagreed, arguing that the Skidi were the same people as they and should not be eradicated. The three bands argued for some time, but the Kitkehaki won the argument. They told the Skidi that they wanted to talk and Skidi subsequently agreed to their terms. The Southern Pawnees took much of the Skidi property, including many horses. Many of the Skidi women were forced to marry into the other villages to establish family ties among villages of Pawnee.

===Founding of Lone Tree===
The first pioneers passed through the area on the Mormon Trail in 1847 and later on the Oregon Trail and the California Trail. This location was close to a huge cottonwood tree, called Lone Tree, that the pioneers used on these trails as a landmark. In 1858, the Nebraska Territorial Legislature established Merrick County, naming it after Elvira Merrick, the wife of a Dodge County territorial legislator who introduced the bill creating Merrick County. A yet to be established county seat was called &quot;Elvira&quot; and was said to be located under Lone Tree.

The actual county seat was created in 1866 near the planned location of Elvira and renamed &quot;Lone Tree&quot;. It was established as the Union Pacific Railroad was laying tracks through Merrick County. In 1868, J.H. Berryman built the first substantial building, which functioned as a general store, hotel, bar, courthouse, revival meeting hall, and his home. The first courthouse was built in 1871 and was replaced by the current court house in 1912.

===Name change===
In 1875 a petition was presented to the Merrick County Court requesting a name change for Lone Tree to &quot;Central City&quot;. Proponents of change argued that the name &quot;Lone Tree&quot; gave the impression that the area was desolate and the inhabitants were poor and uncivilized, which would not bring in new settlers and thereby limit the growth of the area. Opponents to change countered that &quot;Lone Tree&quot; portrayed a &quot;beautiful spot and is a name dear to the pioneers.&quot; The proponents of change won out and on July 1, 1875, the name was officially changed to Central City. The new name was meant to designate the city&#x27;s key location within the state&#x27;s agricultural belt.

===Boom town===
By the 1880s, Central City was a boomtown after the arrival of a second railroad, the Burlington &amp; Missouri River. During this time of peak growth, three banks were built, in addition to a hardware store, a roller mill, two newspapers, three lumberyards, a cracker factory, a cigar factory, a new brick school, nine churches, and Nebraska Central College, a Methodist institution which opened in 1885.

The first newspaper in Central City was &quot;The Merrick County News,&quot; which published its first edition on March 21, 1872; it would become the &quot;Courier&quot; in 1874. Several attempts were made to establish a second paper, starting with the &quot;Sentinel,&quot; a &quot;railroad&quot; paper, on April 10, 1873; it lasted only a short time. In 1880, the &quot;Merrick County Item&quot; was first published, but lasted only until 1881. In 1882, the &quot;Nonpareil&quot; opened and Central City again had two newspapers.

By the 1890s, economic growth had slowed. The &quot;Courier&quot; closed in 1890, and Nebraska Central College closed in 1891. A flood washed out both the Union Pacific and Burlington railroad tracks. By the mid-1890s, economic conditions were improving. Two new newspapers opened: the &quot;Record&quot; in 1895 (which would close in 1908) and the &quot;Republican&quot; in 1896 (which would merge with the &quot;Nonpareil&quot; to form the current &quot;Republican-Nonpareil&quot; in 1953). The Society of Friends (Quakers) reopened Nebraska Central College in 1899.

The early 1900s saw the construction of a new courthouse (1911–1913), the historic Martha Ellen Auditorium (1916, earlier an opera house), and a new high school. Economic growth was aided in the 1920s by the opening of a branch of Omaha Cold Storage in 1927, allowing farmers to sell their poultry and eggs locally at better prices. Perhaps the most notable citizen of Central City, Wright Morris, lived here from 1910 to 1919.

===1930s to the present===
A library was built just before the Great Depression, but little construction took place during the 1930s. In the 1940s, construction resumed when a hospital was built and a gymnasium was added for the high school. In the 1950s, Nebraska Central College closed (1953), but a new hospital was built in 1959. In 1975, an explosion and fire destroyed an entire city block, but Central City still reached its largest population to date at 3,083 people in 1980. Central City&#x27;s population has declined slightly since then.

<text>Auburn is a city in Nemaha County, Nebraska, United States, and its county seat. The population was 3,470 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Auburn is an incorporation of two towns. Calvert and Sheridan combined to form Auburn in 1882, in part to have the voting power to wrestle the county seat away from Brownville, Nebraska, a village located ten miles east. The incorporation was successful, and in 1883, Auburn was named the county seat. The city is named after Auburn, New York.

The only person to be elected to the United States Congress as a member of the Prohibitionist Party, Charles Hiram Randall, was born in Auburn on July 23, 1865.

From 1910 to 1913, Auburn was home to the Auburn Athletics, a Class C level minor league baseball team. The Auburn Athletics played as members of the Missouri-Iowa-Nebraska-Kansas League for the duration of the league. The Auburn Athletics played home games at the Legion Memorial Park. Still in use today, Legion Memorial Park is designated as a National Historic Park site. The address is 1015 J Street.

<text>Brownville is a village in Nemaha County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 142 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Established in 1854 and incorporated in 1856, Brownville was the largest town in the Nebraska Territory, with a population of 1,309 by 1880. Bordering slave-holding Missouri, the town became an important port on the Missouri River. Daniel Freeman, the first homesteader to file a claim under the Homestead Act of 1862, staked his claim at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party in Brownville.

The rise of the railroad was ultimately Brownville&#x27;s undoing. The railroads siphoned traffic away from the Missouri River&#x27;s steamboats. Brownville&#x27;s attempt to secure a railroad of its own was severely botched and led to immense tax increases to pay the bonds for the failed venture. This drove most of the population away and led to the county seat being transferred to Auburn in 1885. In 1856 Thomas Weston Tipton moved to the town to serve as a minister. He later became a U.S. Senator, and ran an unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Nebraska. Omaha land magnates Herman and Augustus Kountze held large holdings in the early town.

After the American Civil War, David Mercer established a law practice in the town. Mercer later served as a long-time U.S. Representative from Nebraska. The Nebraska State Fair was held in the town in 1870 and 71. That year Eugene Gilmore, the future acting Governor-General of the Philippines, was born in the town.

The Brownville Bridge was built over the Missouri River in 1939. Today it is on the National Register of Historic Places. Owing to its place in Nebraska history, Brownville is primarily a tourist attraction with several old houses opened for tours or converted into museums. Art galleries and wineries in and near Brownville have also helped to make the town an increasingly attractive getaway for residents of the region&#x27;s larger cities. Omaha&#x27;s &quot;River City Star&quot; was built in the town in 1967, and was originally named the &quot;Belle of Brownville&quot;. The Governor Furnas Arboretum was planted in the city in 1992. The arboretum is named in honor of Nebraska&#x27;s second governor, Robert W. Furnas, the signer of the first declaration of Arbor Day. The Cooper Nuclear Station is south of the city. In 1995 a mild tornado blew through the town.

In 1913 one of three men who were under suspicion had a heatstroke in Kansas. He thought he was going to die so he confessed to his part in the murder. He recovered, was brought back to Auburn where he was tried and convicted. The murderer spent the rest of his life in the Nebraska State Penitentiary.

==In popular culture==
The novel &quot;Brave in Season&quot; (Sunbury Press, 2023), written by Jon Volkmer, is set in Julian.

<text>Peru is a city in Nemaha County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 648 at the 2020 census. Peru State College is located in Peru.

==History==
The first attempt to settle the community took place in 1853, by some residents of Peru, Illinois. However, troops from Fort Kearny forced them to leave because Nebraska Territory belonged to the Otoe tribe. The settlers then temporarily settled across the Missouri River at Sonora. In 1857, a community formed around a trading post called Mount Vernon on the bluffs above the river on the Nebraska side.

In 1857, settlers founded Peru down the hill from Mount Vernon directly on the Missouri River. In 1861, a Methodist school called Mount Vernon Academy opened. In 1867, the school (which became Peru State College) became the state&#x27;s first normal school.

Floods in the 1860s changed the course of the river, pushing it nearly a mile from Peru. An 1867 flood caused the Nebraska community of McKissick Island, northeast of Peru, to be surrounded by Missouri land and precipitated a border dispute that would not be resolved until 1999.

==History==
Dunbar was founded in 1856 by John Dunbar on the intersection of the properties of John Dunbar, T. H. Dunbar, J. Wilson, and John McGinley. It was originally known as Wilson until 1856 when it was renamed for the oldest resident and recognized founder. Dunbar was a large freighting depot for goods traveling west out of Nebraska City. The first railroad was built in Dunbar in 1869 when the Midland Pacific Railway and Burlington and Missouri River Railroads reached Nebraska City. By the 1880s, the town contained a grocery, general store, restaurant, boarding house, two hotels, two liveries, five churches, pharmacy, lumberyard, two banks, barbershop, two saloons, dentist, optometrist. In 1884 and 1888 two fires occurred, prompting the usage of brick and mortar. About south of Dunbar, the Delaware (named for the township) Cemetery was constructed. The earliest marked grave being in 1884.

In 1926, Dunbar observed its 70th birthday. A boulder was placed in memory of John Dunbar. The Nebraska City High School Band performed a concert and other festivities continued into the evening.

The flooding of Wilson Creek, Fox Creek, and several other tributaries on May 8, 1950, devastated the village. Nine buildings were washed away, the rest of the buildings were nearly destroyed, and two children were killed. In 1965, the Dunbar bypass was finished, greatly damaging the businesses of Dunbar, the population was decimated and the economy plummeted. The three mile stretch through Dunbar was noted as the worst from Chicago to Denver

===Train derailment and &quot;State v. Hoffman&quot;===
On January 11, 1887, at 11:30 p.m., David Hoffman and James Bell derailed a passenger train north of Dunbar. The engineer was killed, and two people were severely injured. The train was carrying $17,000 in silver. The two were arrested the next day. Hoffman was charged with first degree murder and sent to the gallows, while Bell was sentenced to ten years of hard labor in exchange for his testimony. On Friday, July 22, 1887, at 10:32, David Hoffman became the first person legally executed in Otoe County.

<text>Nebraska City is a city in Nebraska and the county seat of Otoe County, Nebraska, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 7,222.

The Nebraska State Legislature has credited Nebraska City as being the oldest incorporated city in the state, as it was the first approved by a special act of the Nebraska Territorial Legislature in 1855.

Nebraska City is home of Arbor Day, the Missouri River Basin Lewis and Clark Center (which focuses on the natural history achievements of the expedition), and the Mayhew Cabin, the only site in the state recognized by the National Park Service as a station on the Underground Railroad.

==History==
Early European-American official exploration was reported in 1804 by Lewis and Clark as they journeyed west along the Missouri River. They encountered many of the historic Native American tribes whose ancestors had inhabited the territory for thousands of years.

During the years of early pioneer settlement, in 1846 the US Army built Old Fort Kearny at Nebraska City. Several years later, the army abandoned it to relocate the fort to central Nebraska, now south of present-day Kearney.

Shortly after the post was vacated, John Boulware developed an important river-crossing and ferry service from Iowa to present-day Nebraska City. He and his father expanded their business and in 1852 or 1853 built a ferry house, the first residence in Nebraska City.

In 1854 the Kansas–Nebraska Act allowed legal settlement in the regional area. Three townships were incorporated by settlers including Stephen Nuckolls, one of the fathers of Nebraska City. Nebraska City and Kearney City were incorporated in 1855, and South Nebraska City was incorporated in 1856. During those years, Nebraska City competed fiercely to become the Nebraska Territory capital. On December 31, 1857, these three town sites along with Prairie City joined, incorporating as present-day Nebraska City. Before the American Civil War, Nebraska City was noted as having the Territory&#x27;s largest population of slaves. Many worked on the riverfront as laborers, involved with moving freight and luggage associated with steamboat traffic.

By the mid-19th century, steamboats on the Missouri River were the vitalizing force behind Nebraska City&#x27;s growth, bringing commerce, people and freight to the west. In the spring of 1858 Russell, Majors and Waddell started freighting from Nebraska City on a government contract to transport all provisions for all western forts. The supplies were brought up the Missouri River by steamboat and then taken out by wagon train. Nebraska City&#x27;s favorable position (with a gradual slope from the river to the table land above) and good trail made it an important link to the west.

Since that beginning, the city became established as a regional transportation, economic, and agriculture hub for the three state area. Additional forms of transportation were important, including the steam wagon and the first locomotive engine of the Midland Pacific.

J. Sterling Morton came to Nebraska City in 1855 to edit the &quot;Nebraska City News&quot;. Originally from Michigan, he and his wife Caroline were lovers of nature. Morton served as Secretary of Agriculture under President Grover Cleveland’s administration and in 1872 he was instrumental in establishing the annual tree planting day, Arbor Day. Governor Robert Furnas of Nebraska issued the first Arbor Day Proclamation on March 31, 1874. The holiday is celebrated around the world.

Nebraska City has its own hospital, St Marys Hospital. As the county seat, it has the courthouse and associated county offices.

<text>Otoe is a village in north central Otoe County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 161 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The village was established in 1880 on the proposed line of the Missouri Pacific Railroad from Kansas City to Omaha. The town was originally named Berlin; many of the early inhabitants were German Lutherans. In 1896, when the population reached 200, the town incorporated. It survived and rebuilt after a tornado in 1913 destroyed most of its businesses.

The entry of the United States into World War I was followed by anti-German sentiment, which extended to a town that bore the name of Germany&#x27;s capital. A 1918 series of fires that destroyed a block of the town&#x27;s main street was attributed to anti-German crusaders. In October 1918, less than a month before the war&#x27;s end, the town&#x27;s name was changed to its current Otoe. Berlin Precinct was left unchanged, however.

Passenger rail service to Otoe was discontinued in 1932; despite this setback, the town continued to grow, reaching its maximum historical population of 298 in the 1940 census. Following World War II, the population began to decline. In 1958, the high school was closed; in the 1960s, the railroad line through Otoe was abandoned.

<text>Atlanta is a village in Phelps County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 131 at the 2010 Census. During World War II, the town was neighbored by Camp Atlanta, which housed more than 3,000 Nazi German prisoners of war over three years. The camp was said to house more prisoners during the war than the town had in population during its entire existence.

==History==
Atlanta was laid out in 1883 when the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad was extended to that point. It was likely named after Atlanta, Georgia.

In the first part of the 20th century, Atlanta was home to several amenities for neighboring farmers. They included a grocery store, post office, cafe, and a tourist shop for drivers on U.S. Route 6, as well as corn and grain elevators and two gas stations. Chataqua groups entertained at the town hall, with annual events such as the Atlanta Institute, which was an annual fair. There were also free outdoor &quot;picture shows&quot;, and the Atlanta Industry Day Picnic. The Atlanta schoolhouse had eight grades. At the beginning of World War II, there was one street, approximately two blocks long, with only a few business buildings drooping and dwindling along its edges.

==Camp Atlanta==

During World War II, Camp Atlanta was established next to the town as an Allied POW camp to house German POWs. The Atlanta area had been the final choice of the U.S. Army to establish a $2 million POW camp after the outbreak of World War II. When construction began in September 1943 people were told this would be a &quot;Conchie Camp&quot; for the conscientious objectors from the United States. By November it became known by locals that Atlanta would be a prisoner-of-war camp expected to guard German prisoners. There were approximately 275 enlisted men and 60 officers.

Soldiers were hired out to local farms to help retrieve the increased crop production demanded by the war. More than 30 local farmers sought assistance, paying the government for work completed by the POWs. Soon after the first of the year in 1946, some soldiers returned to live in Atlanta, and at least two of the Germans applied for U.S. citizenship and returned as well.

<text>Holdrege is a city in Phelps County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 5,495 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Phelps County. The Nebraska Prairie Museum is located in Holdrege.

==History==
Holdrege was established in 1883 when the railroad was extended to that point. It was named for George Ward Holdrege, a railroad official. Holdrege was designated county seat in 1884.

Holdrege was settled primarily by immigrants from Sweden in the 1880s and was named after George Ward Holdrege, general manager of the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad Company. He constructed most of the line&#x27;s mileage in Nebraska, including a section through this small settlement in Phelps County. On December 10, 1883, the first train arrived in Holdrege, a little pioneer town inhabited by 200 people.

In 1884, a campaign was started to move the county seat from Phelps Center to Holdrege, and an election was scheduled for October. By that time, the town had acquired a block of ground on which to erect a courthouse. With calm assurance of victory at the polls, Holdrege laid the cornerstone of the building intended to be the Phelps County Courthouse. At the special election, Holdrege received a majority of the votes but the legality of the election was questioned. So citizens of Holdrege went to Phelps Center, picked up the official records and books and hid them for two months pending the arrival of new county officials who would take over on January 1, 1885. Holdrege succeeded in becoming the county seat and the courthouse was completed.

Holdrege was incorporated on February 14, 1884, and quickly became the metropolis of the county, being well located with good roads from all directions. The early history of the town was one of ups and downs—good crops one year then drought and no crops at all for several years. In 1910, C. W. McConaughy, a Holdrege grain dealer, began crusading for use of the Platte River to supplement subsoil moisture for farmlands in the area. His dream became reality when Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District began its power production and irrigation operations and water flowed into Phelps County for irrigation in 1941.

A large increase in the population of Holdrege in the immediate post-war years was due mostly to irrigation. With irrigation came both stable and increased crop production, which brought a pipeline company, grain elevators, and agriculture-related businesses to town. The city was declared a first-class city on May 4, 1967.

<text>Paroxetine, sold under the brand name Paxil among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It has also been used in the treatment of premature ejaculation and hot flashes due to menopause. It is taken orally (by mouth).
Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, trouble sleeping, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. It is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of the chemical serotonin by neurons in the brain.
Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7million prescriptions. In 2018, it was in the top 10 of most prescribed antidepressants in the United States.

==Medical uses==
Paroxetine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It is also occasionally used for agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and menopausal hot flashes.

===Depression===
A variety of meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of paroxetine in depression. They have variously concluded that paroxetine is superior or equivalent to placebo and that it is equivalent to other antidepressants. Despite this, there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any point in time.

=== Anxiety disorders ===

Paroxetine was the first antidepressant approved in the United States for the treatment of panic disorder. Several studies have concluded that paroxetine is superior to placebo in the treatment of panic disorder.
Paroxetine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults and children. It is also beneficial for people with co-occurring social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. It appears to be similar to a number of other SSRIs.
Paroxetine is used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparative efficacy of paroxetine is equivalent to that of clomipramine and venlafaxine. Paroxetine is also effective for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Paroxetine is approved for the treatment of PTSD in the United States, Japan, and Europe. In the United States, it is approved for short-term use.

Paroxetine is also FDA-approved for generalized anxiety disorder.

=== Menopausal hot flashes ===
In 2013, low-dose paroxetine was approved in the US for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause. At the low dose used for menopausal hot flashes, side effects are similar to placebo and dose tapering is not required for discontinuation.

=== Fibromyalgia ===
Studies have also shown paroxetine &quot;appears to be well-tolerated and improve the overall symptomatology in patients with fibromyalgia&quot;, but is less robust in helping with the pain involved.

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndromes may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe.

Paroxetine shares many of the common adverse effects of SSRIs, including (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses):
* nausea 26% (9%)
* diarrhea 12% (8%)
* constipation 14% (9%)
* dry mouth 18% (12%)
* somnolence 23% (9%)
* insomnia 13% (6%)
* headache 18% (17%)
* hypomania 1% (0.3%)
* blurred vision 4% (1%)
* loss of appetite 6% (2%)
* nervousness 5% (3%)
* paraesthesia 4% (2%)
* dizziness 13% (6%)
* asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%))
* tremor 8% (2%)
* sweating 11% (2%)
* sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence).

Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, but a higher incidence of anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain.

Due to reports of adverse withdrawal reactions upon terminating treatment, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use at the European Medicines Agency recommends gradually reducing over several weeks or months if the decision to withdraw is made. See also Discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal).

Mania or hypomania may occur in 1% of patients with depression and up to 12% of patients with bipolar disorder. This side effect can occur in individuals with no history of mania, but it may be more likely to occur in those with bipolar disorder or with a family history of mania.

Paroxetine is described as a &#x27;hepatoxic agent&#x27; and has been associated with hepatoxicity and jaundice.

===Suicide===
Like other antidepressants, paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in people under the age of 25. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 and found an increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. In 2015, a paper published in &quot;The BMJ&quot; that reanalysed the original case notes argued that in Study 329, assessing paroxetine and imipramine against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for paroxetine.

===Sexual dysfunction===

Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, anorgasmia, lack of vaginal lubrication, and erectile dysfunction, is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with paroxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is higher than 70%. Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional.

===Pregnancy===

Antidepressant exposure (including paroxetine) is associated with shorter duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by ), and lower Apgar scores (by &lt;0.4 points). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that for pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, paroxetine &quot;be avoided, if possible&quot;, as it may be associated with increased risk of birth defects.

Babies born to women who used paroxetine during the first trimester have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations, primarily ventricular and atrial septal defects. Unless the benefits of paroxetine justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to stopping or switching to another antidepressant. Paroxetine use during pregnancy is associated with about 1.5– to 1.7-fold increase in congenital birth defects, in particular, heart defects, cleft lip and palate, clubbed feet, or any birth defects.

===Discontinuation syndrome===

Many psychoactive medications can cause withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation from administration. Paroxetine has among the highest incidence rates and severity of withdrawal syndrome of any medication of its class. Common withdrawal symptoms for paroxetine include nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo; insomnia, nightmares, and vivid dreams; feelings of electricity in the body, as well as rebound depression and anxiety. A liquid formulation of paroxetine is available and allows a very gradual decrease of the dose, which may prevent discontinuation syndrome. Another recommendation is to temporarily switch to fluoxetine, which has a longer half-life and thus decreases the severity of discontinuation syndrome.

In 2002, the U.S. FDA published a warning regarding &quot;severe&quot; discontinuation symptoms among those terminating paroxetine treatment, including paraesthesia, nightmares, and dizziness. The agency also warned of case reports describing agitation, sweating, and nausea. In connection with a Glaxo spokesperson&#x27;s statement that withdrawal reactions occur only in 0.2% of patients and are &quot;mild and short-lived&quot;, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations said GSK had breached two of the federation&#x27;s codes of practice.

Paroxetine prescribing information posted at GlaxoSmithKline has been updated related to the occurrence of a discontinuation syndrome, including serious discontinuation symptoms.

==Overdose==
Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia, and seizures. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of paroxetine may be measured to monitor therapeutic administration, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Plasma paroxetine concentrations are generally in a range of 40–400 μg/L in persons receiving daily therapeutic doses and 200–2,000 μg/L in poisoned patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 1–4 mg/L in acute lethal overdose situations. Along with the other SSRIs, sertraline and fluoxetine, paroxetine is considered a low-risk drug in cases of overdose.

== Interactions ==

Interactions with other drugs acting on the serotonin system or impairing the metabolism of serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reaction. Such reactions have been observed with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, but particularly with concurrent use of triptans, MAO inhibitors, antipsychotics, or other dopamine antagonists.

The prescribing information states that paroxetine should &quot;not be used in combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI&quot;, and should not be used in combination with pimozide, thioridazine, tryptophan, or warfarin.

Paroxetine interacts with the following cytochrome P450 enzymes:
* CYP2D6 for which it is both a substrate and a potent inhibitor.
* CYP2B6 (&quot;strong&quot;) inhibitor.
* CYP3A4 (&quot;weak&quot;) inhibitor.
* CYP1A2 (&quot;weak&quot;) inhibitor.
* CYP2C9 (&quot;weak&quot;) inhibitor.
* CYP2C19 (&quot;weak&quot;) inhibitor.

Paroxetine has been shown to be an inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2).

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Paroxetine is the most potent and one of the most specific selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It also binds to the allosteric site of the serotonin transporter, similarly to escitalopram, though less potently so. Paroxetine also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine to a lesser extent (&lt;50 nmol/L). Based on evidence from four weeks of administration in rats, the equivalent of 20 mg paroxetine taken once daily occupies approximately 88% of serotonin transporters in the prefrontal cortex. Paroxetine is a phenylpiperidine and might have some affinity for opioid receptors.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Paroxetine is well-absorbed following oral administration. It has an absolute bioavailability of about 50%, with evidence of a saturable first pass effect. When taken orally, it achieves maximum concentration in about 6–10 hours and reaches steady-state in 7–14 days. Paroxetine exhibits significant interindividual variations in volume of distribution and clearance. Less than 2% of an oral dose is excreted in urine unchanged.

Paroxetine is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2D6.

==Society and culture==

Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

GlaxoSmithKline has paid substantial fines, paid settlements in class-action lawsuits, and become the subject of several highly critical books about its marketing of paroxetine, in particular, the off-label marketing of paroxetine for children, the suppression of negative research results relating to its use in children, and allegations that it failed to warn consumers of substantial withdrawal effects associated with the use of the drug.

===Marketing===
In 2004, GSK agreed to settle charges of consumer fraud for $2.5 million. The legal discovery process also uncovered evidence of deliberate, systematic suppression of unfavorable Paxil research results. One of GSK&#x27;s internal documents read, &quot;It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy [in children] had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine&quot;.

In 2012, the United States Department of Justice fined GlaxoSmithKline $3 billion for withholding data, unlawfully promoting use in those under 18, and preparing an article that misleadingly reported the effects of paroxetine in adolescents with depression following its clinical trial study 329.

In February 2016, the UK Competition and Markets Authority imposed record fines of £45 million on companies that were found to have infringed European Union and UK Competition law by entering into agreements to delay the market entry of generic versions of the drug in the UK. GlaxoSmithKline received the bulk of the fines, being fined £37,600,757. Other companies that produce generics were issued fines which collectively total £7,384,146. UK public health services are likely to claim damages for being overcharged in the period where the generic versions of the drug were illegally blocked from the market, as the generics are over 70% less expensive. GlaxoSmithKline may also face actions from other generic manufacturers who incurred losses as a result of the anticompetitive conduct. In April 2016, appeals were lodged with the Competition Appeal Tribunal by the companies which were fined.

GSK marketed paroxetine through television advertisements in the 1990s and 2000s. Commercials also aired for the CR version of the drug beginning in 2003.

===Economics===
In 2007, paroxetine was ranked 94th on the list of bestselling drugs, with over $1 billion in sales. In 2006, paroxetine was the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. retail market, with more than 19.7 million prescriptions. In 2007, sales had dropped slightly to 18.1 million but paroxetine remained the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S.

===Brand names===
Brand names include Aropax, Paretin, Brisdelle, Deroxat, Paxil, Pexeva, Paxtine, Paxetin, Paroxat, Paraxyl, Sereupin, Daparox and Seroxat.

==Research==
Several studies have suggested that paroxetine can be used in the treatment of premature ejaculation. In particular, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was found to increase 6- to 13-fold, which was somewhat longer than the delay achieved by the treatment with other SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram). However, paroxetine taken acutely (&quot;on demand&quot;) 3–10 hours before coitus resulted only in a &quot;clinically irrelevant and sexually unsatisfactory&quot; 1.5-fold delay of ejaculation and was inferior to clomipramine, which induced a fourfold delay.

There is also evidence that paroxetine may be effective in the treatment of compulsive gambling and hot flashes.

Benefits of paroxetine prescription for diabetic neuropathy or chronic tension headache are uncertain.

Although the evidence is conflicting, paroxetine may be effective for the treatment of dysthymia, a chronic disorder involving depressive symptoms for most days of the year.

There is evidence to support that paroxetine selectively binds to and inhibits G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in mice with heart failure. Since GRK2 regulates the activity of the beta adrenergic receptor, which becomes desensitized in cases of heart failure, paroxetine (or a paroxetine derivative) could be used as a heart failure treatment in the future.

Paroxetine has been identified as a potential disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug.

==Veterinary use==
Paroxetine may be useful in the treatment of canine or feline behavioral diagnoses and is effective in the treatment of social anxiety, depression, and agitation associated with depression.

== Other organisms ==
Paroxetine is a common finding in wastewater. It is highly toxic to the alga &quot;Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata&quot; (syn. &quot;Raphidocelis subcapitata&quot;).

It also is toxic to the soil nematode &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;.

Alberca &quot;et al.&quot;, 2016 found that paroxetine acts as a trypanocide against &quot;T. cruzi&quot;.

Alberca &quot;et al.&quot;, 2016 finds a leishmanicide effect. Alberca finds that paroxetine produces cell death of the promastigotes of &quot;L. infantum&quot;. The mechanism of action remains unknown.

Various types of bacteria can break down paroxetine in the environment. These include, for example &quot;Pseudomonas sp.&quot;, &quot;Bosea sp.&quot;, &quot;Shewanella sp., Species of Chitinophagaceae and &quot;Acinetobacter sp.

<doc id="124124" wikidata="Q57968" url="?curid=124124" title="Matthäus Merian the Elder">
<text>Matthäus Merian &quot;der Ältere&quot; (or &quot;Matthew&quot;, &quot;the Elder&quot;, or &quot;Sr.&quot;; 22 September 1593 – 19 June 1650) was a Swiss-born engraver who worked in Frankfurt, Germany for most of his career, where he also ran a publishing house. He was a member of the patrician Basel Merian family.

==Biography==

===Early life and marriage===
Born in Basel, Merian learned the art of copperplate engraving in Zürich. He next worked and studied in Strasbourg, Nancy, and Paris, before returning to Basel in 1615. The following year he moved to Oppenheim, Germany where he worked for the publisher Johann Theodor de Bry, who was the son of renowned engraver and traveler Theodor de Bry.

In 1617, Merian married Maria Magdalena de Bry, daughter of the publisher, and was for a time associated with the de Bry publishing house. In 1620, when Oppenheim was destroyed by fire during the Spanish occupation, they moved back to Basel, but three years later returned to Germany, this time to Frankfurt. They had four daughters and three sons, including Matthäus Merian the Younger. Maria Magdalena de Bry died in 1645 and the following year Matthäus married Johanna Sibylla Heim. Five years later, Matthäus died, leaving his wife with two small children, Anna Maria Sibylla Merian (born 1647), who later became a pioneering naturalist and illustrator, and a son, Maximilian, who died before his third birthday.

===Later career===
In 1623 Merian took over the publishing house of his father-in-law after de Bry&#x27;s death. In 1626 he became a citizen of Frankfurt and could henceforth work as an independent publisher. He spent most of his working life in Frankfurt.

Early in his life, he had created detailed town plans in his unique style, e.g. a plan of Basel (1615) and a plan of Paris (1615). With Martin Zeiler (1589–1661), a German geographer, and later () with his own son, Matthäus Merian (&quot;der Jüngere&quot;, i.e. &quot;the Younger&quot; or &quot;Jr.&quot;) (1621–1687), he produced a series of &quot;Topographia&quot;. The 21-volume set was collectively known as the &quot;Topographia Germaniae&quot;. It includes numerous town plans and views, as well as maps of most countries and a World Map—it was such a popular work that it was re-issued in many editions. He also took over and completed the later parts and editions of the &quot;Grand Voyages&quot; and &quot;Petits Voyages&quot;, originally started by de Bry in 1590 and included volumes &quot;India Orientalis&quot; and &quot;America Occidentalis&quot;.

Merian&#x27;s work inspired the &quot;Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna&quot; by Erik Dahlberg. The German travel magazine &quot;Merian&quot; is named after him.

He was also noted for the finesse of his alchemical illustrations, in books such as the &quot;Musaeum Hermeticum&quot; (1678) and &quot;Atalanta Fugiens&quot; (1618). He undertook the engravings for the encyclopaedic work of insect natural history &quot;De Serpentibus&quot;, compiled by John Jonston. This tradition would be taken up by his daughter.

Matthäus Merian died after several years of illness in 1650 in Langenschwalbach, near Wiesbaden.

After his death, his sons Matthäus Jr. and Caspar took over the publishing house. They continued publishing the &quot;Topographia Germaniae&quot; and the &quot;Theatrum Europaeum&quot; under the name &quot;Merian Erben&quot; (i.e. Merian Heirs).

<text>Plainview is a city in Pierce County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Norfolk, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,275 at the 2022 census.

==History==
The area of Plainview was first settled by William B. Chilvers around 1871. A year later in 1872, the first post office was established. The township was named Roseville after the first Postmaster, Charles Rose. In 1874, after Christian Lerum made a suggestion, the area and the post office were renamed to Plainview. The town of Plainview was incorporated and officially became Plainview Township in April 1886.

Plainview was platted in 1880 when the railroad was extended to that point. It took its name after Plainview, Minnesota, and from the scenic landscapes of the surrounding plains.

When Plainview was platted in 1880, there were roughly 80 settlers, two churches (one Methodist and one Congregational), one doctor, one drug store, two blacksmiths, two general stores, one hotel, and two agricultural implement dealers. The first school was made out of sod and was organized in 1872. The Bank of Plainview was the first bank in Plainview and was organized in 1884.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Plainview promotes itself as the &quot;Klown Kapital&quot; of the world, boasting a Klown Festival every June and a Klown Doll Museum with more than 4,500 pieces on display.
Plainview has three structures on the National Register of Historic Places: the Foy George Memorial Band Shell; the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad depot, now serving as the Plainview Historical Museum; and the Carnegie library, still in use as such. The site of Plainview&#x27;s first sod house is on city land; the city also has two Sears Catalog homes.

The &quot;Plainview News&quot; is the city&#x27;s only newspaper.

Plainview is served by an independent telephone company, and has state-of-the-art fiber optics throughout the city. Plainview holds the distinction of being the first city in Nebraska with fiber-optic lines for every resident and business.

The city council is a four-person council with a mayor position. Council members serve four-year terms, with a rotating schedule of term limits. The mayor also recently appointed a city administrator.

Plainview was used as the fictional &quot;Hawthorne&quot; where much of the 2013 film &quot;Nebraska&quot; takes place.

A volunteer fire department and EMS serves Plainview.

<doc id="124127" wikidata="Q932391" url="?curid=124127" title="Columbus, Nebraska">
<text>Columbus is the county seat of Platte County, Nebraska, situated at the confluence of the Loup and Platte rivers roughly 85 miles (137 km) west-northwest of Omaha and 75 miles (121 km) northwest of Lincoln by road, near the county&#x27;s southern edge. With an estimated population of 24,464 as of 2024, it is the 10th-most populous city in Nebraska. 

Initially settled in May 1856 along the historic Great Platte River Road, the city was named for Columbus, Ohio; its location along the proposed transcontinental railroad made it especially attractive to early settlers. Despite the construction of a hydroelectric plant, the Great Depression hit the region especially hard. Since, its economy has pivoted to one based on agriculture, manufacturing, and services such as healthcare. 

Today, Columbus is governed by a mayor and a city council. The city is located in the Omaha media market, and has 6 radio stations licensed to it; it is also home to the &quot;Columbus Telegram&quot;, a newspaper published five days per week. A campus of Central Community College is located 4 miles (6 km) outside Columbus; its sports teams are the Raiders. 
==History==

===Native Americans and Exploration===
In the 18th century, the area around the confluence of the Platte and the Loup Rivers was used by a variety of Native American tribes, including Pawnee, Otoe, Ponca, and Omaha.
The Pawnee are thought to have descended from the Protohistoric Lower Loup Culture; 
the Otoe had moved from central Iowa into the lower Platte Valley in the early 18th century; 
and the closely related Omaha and Ponca had moved from the vicinity of the Ohio River mouth, settling along the Missouri by the mid-18th century.
In 1720, Pawnee and Otoe allied with the French massacred the Spanish force led by Pedro de Villasur just south of the present site of Columbus. In 1739, the French traders Pierre and Paul Mallet stayed at the Pani-Maha village near this site while making the first known French voyage to Spanish-ruled Santa Fe.

In the 19th century, the &quot;Great Platte River Road&quot;—the valley of the Platte and North Platte Rivers running from Fort Kearny to Fort Laramie— was the principal route of the westward expansion.
For travellers following the north bank of the Platte, the Loup River, with its soft banks and quicksands, represented a major obstacle. In the absence of a ferry or a bridge, most of these followed the Loup for a considerable distance upstream before attempting a crossing: the first major wave of Mormon emigrants, for instance, continued up that river to a point about three miles downstream from present-day Fullerton.

===Settlement and early history===

The site of Columbus was settled by the Columbus Town Company on May 28, 1856. The group took its name from Columbus, Ohio, where most of the settlers had originally lived. The townsite was selected for its location on the proposed route of the transcontinental railroad.

Just west of the Columbus site, the Elk Horn and Loup Fork Bridge and Ferry Company, headed by James C. Mitchell, had laid out the townsite of Pawnee. In 1855, Mitchell had obtained from the First Nebraska Territorial Legislature the right to operate a ferry across the Loup River. The two companies consolidated in November 1856.

At the time of its initial settling, the land Columbus occupied still belonged to the Pawnee. However, in 1857, the Pawnee signed a treaty whereunder they gave up the bulk of their Nebraska lands, save for a reservation on what is now Nance County, Nebraska.

In 1858, the Platte County Commissioners passed an act of incorporation making Columbus a town; 
at this time there were 16 citizens. It became the county seat shortly thereafter.
In that same year, at the recommendation of the U.S. Army, a ferry across the Loup was installed; contemporary documents suggest that the Mitchell company had failed to act on its right to operate such a ferry.

===Railroads and growth===
Growth of the town was slow until 1863. In that year, construction began in Omaha on the transcontinental railroad. The Homestead Act, passed the previous year, attracted a host of settlers to the Plains and gave rise to increased emigrant traffic business. The ferry across the Loup was replaced by a seasonal pontoon bridge, used in the summer and taken up in the winter.
The railroad reached Columbus in June 1866, when the city&#x27;s population was about 75.

The energetic and eccentric promoter George Francis Train envisioned building &quot;a magnificent highway of cities&quot; from coast to coast along the Union Pacific route; Columbus was to be one of these.
In 1865, he bought several hundred lots in the city. In the following year, seeing the nearby townsite of Cleveland as a threat to his plans for Columbus, he bought the only building on the site, a hotel, and moved it to Columbus. He renamed the building the Credit Foncier Hotel, after his land company, Credit Foncier of America; 
in it, he set aside a room permanently reserved for the President of the United States.
Train believed that the capital of the United States should be in the geographic center of the nation, 
and promoted Columbus as &quot;...the new center of the Union and quite probably the future capital of the U.S.A.&quot;

Columbus grew and prospered during the 1870s, as a result of both expanding agriculture in Platte County and traffic on the railroad. During the decade, the population of the county grew threefold, and Columbus became the trade center for an eight-county area. The Black Hills Gold Rush in 1875 led the city&#x27;s merchants to promote it as a staging and outfitting area for gold seekers, who could ride the railroad to Columbus and then travel overland to the gold fields.

In 1879, Columbus became the focus of a war between railroad companies. The Burlington and Missouri proposed to develop a line from Lincoln through Columbus and into northwestern Nebraska, and urged the citizens of Platte County to vote a bond of $100,000 for construction expenses. Union Pacific financier Jay Gould, displeased at the prospect of competition, informed the voters of the county that if the measure passed, he would do his best to ruin Columbus. After a heated campaign, the measure passed despite Gould&#x27;s threats. The Burlington and Missouri built a line from Lincoln to Columbus, but stopped there; for their diagonal route across Nebraska, they chose one that crossed the Union Pacific at Grand Island rather than Columbus.

Gould sought to make good on his threat. When the Union Pacific developed its subsidiary Omaha, Niobrara and Black Hills Railroad, he directed that it cross the Loup River at Lost Creek, then run south to join the Union Pacific&#x27;s main line at Jackson (since renamed Duncan), bypassing Columbus. Fortunately for Columbus, an ice jam destroyed the Lost Creek bridge in the spring of 1881. Railroad officials agreed to reroute the line down the north bank of the Loup to Columbus in exchange for a $25,000 contribution from the city.

===Automobile age===
In 1911, the Meridian Highway project was launched with the formation of a Meridian Road association in Kansas. Later that same year, John Nicholson, originator of the highway, spoke at a meeting in Columbus, at which the Nebraska Meridian Road Association was organized. The proposed north–south transcontinental highway crossed the Platte and the Loup rivers at the Columbus bridges. In 1922, it was designated a state highway. The completion of the Meridian Bridge in 1924, replacing a seasonal ferry across the Missouri River at the Nebraska-South Dakota border, made the highway a year-round route from Canada to Mexico. In 1928, the route became U.S. Highway 81.

In 1913, the Lincoln Highway was established as an east–west transcontinental highway. It followed the Platte River route across Nebraska; ultimately, about half of its mileage was on the Union Pacific right-of-way.
It also crossed the Loup on the bridge at Columbus.
In 1926, the route became U.S. Highway 30.

Traffic on the two transcontinental auto routes through and near central Columbus spurred a burst of commercial construction. Hotels were expanded and new ones built; service garages were opened. To make the route through Columbus more attractive to motorists, the city undertook to illuminate and pave the downtown streets. By 1925, all of the city&#x27;s major commercial thoroughfares were paved, and almost every lot along 13th Street (the Lincoln Highway) between 23rd and 29th Avenues was occupied by a commercial building.

Rural Platte County suffered badly from the Great Depression. Grain and livestock prices had been high during World War I, engendering a bubble in farmland; to acquire additional acres, farmers had secured them with mortgages not only on the newly purchased land, but also on their older holdings. The fall in the prices of agricultural commodities, combined with drought-induced crop failures in 1934 and 1936, forced many such farmers to abandon their lands.

The civic and commercial leaders of Columbus aggressively sought federal and state funds for local construction projects during this time. In 1931, the Meridian Viaduct was completed, carrying the combined Meridian and Lincoln highways across the Union Pacific tracks and eliminating a grade-level crossing.
In 1930–31, the aging and inadequate bridge across the Platte was replaced; in 1932–33, a new bridge was built at the Loup crossing.

===Hydro power===
The most expensive and ambitious of Columbus&#x27;s Depression-era public-works efforts was the construction of the Loup Project. This was a canal running from a diversion weir on the Loup River in Nance County to the Platte River about below the mouth of the Loup.
The waters of the canal run through two hydroelectric generating stations: one north of Monroe with a capacity of 7,800 kW; and one at Columbus with a capacity of 45,600 kW.

Initially financed with a loan and grant of $7.3 million from the Public Works Administration,
construction of the diversion structure, canal, and powerhouses began in August 1934
and was finished, apart from some final details, in September 1938.
At its peak, in October 1936, the project directly employed 1,352 people.

To make payments on the Loup Project bonds, the Loup River Public Power District had to find a market for its electricity. Rural electrification was not expanding rapidly, and private power companies in Nebraska were only willing to buy a small fraction of the project&#x27;s power. Although the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 gave East Coast holding companies an incentive to sell off their Nebraska subsidiaries, bankers were unwilling to finance their sale to the Loup District because of its debts from the canal project.

In 1939, Consumers Public Power District was formed in Columbus. The new organization&#x27;s purpose was to buy power from the Loup Project and from the Tri-County and Sutherland projects on the Platte in central Nebraska, and to market it to consumers and municipal utilities. To this end, it was authorized to issue revenue bonds for the purchase of privately held power companies. By 1942, it had purchased all of the private electrical utilities in Nebraska outside of the immediate vicinity of Omaha; 
by 1949, the last of the private utilities had been bought up, making Nebraska the only state in the nation to be served entirely by public power.

===World War II to 2000===
With the arrival of World War II, Columbus&#x27;s boosters sought a war plant for Columbus. They persuaded the federal government to purchase in northeastern Columbus, and to build a railroad line to the site. Before construction of the projected aluminum-extrusion plant could begin, however, it became clear that the war would end soon and that the plant would not be needed.
The site was sold as surplus property to the Loup District for a fraction of its original cost; the district turned it into an industrial site.
In 1946, Behlen Manufacturing built a factory on the site;
the rest of the available land was occupied soon thereafter.

Columbus Public Schools in 1968 cut off non-resident students in order to become financially solvent, leaving students north of town without an education. In response, Lakeview Community Schools was formed. There are also several Catholic schools in Columbus, including Scotus Central Catholic High School.

Columbus made headlines in 1997 when 25 million pounds of beef from a Hudson Foods plant in the city were recalled. At the time, it was the largest recall in United States history.

In 1999, the East-Central District Health Department was formed as the Platte-Colfax County District Health Department. Platte County, including Columbus, is one of four counties served by the health department, which is located in Columbus along with the Good Neighbor Community Health Center.

=== 2000-present ===
Over 20% of Columbus residents are Hispanic or Latino, as of the 2020 census. In 2009, Fernando Lopez, Karen Gomez and Maria Davila founded Columbus-based Centro Hispano Comunitario de Nebraska which provides immigration, education and business services in three counties.

A Columbus man died during the Midwestern flooding in 2019. He had been trying to help someone stranded in the floodwaters when the bridge he was crossing collapsed.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Columbus City Council passed a mask mandate in a special meeting held in late November. The council voted four to four on the mandate and Mayor Jim Bulkley broke the tie in favor of the mandate. In January 2021, the council voted on an amended ordinance which required masks only if cases hit a certain level. The ordinance expired on Feb. 23, 2021.

Voters in the 2020 election approved a community building project, with space for a library, a potential children&#x27;s museum, an art gallery, coffee shop, community room and City Hall. A previous library ballot measure had failed in 2017. Demolition of the library began in May 2021. The Columbus Community Building held its grand opening in July of 2023 with the Library and City Hall moving into the building immediately, followed by the Columbus Arts Council, Children&#x27;s Museum, and a coffee shop.

A fire smoldered at the Columbus Archer Daniels Midland facility for several weeks in summer 2021. Columbus&#x27; fire chief resigned less than a week after the public found out about the fire.

== Government ==
Columbus is governed by a mayor and city council, which has eight members who represent four wards. The council members are elected for four-year terms on a staggered basis. Columbus&#x27; mayor is also elected for a four-year term. The current mayor is Jim Bulkley and the current council members are Council President Rich Jablonski, Ron Schilling, Hope Freshour, J. Prent Roth, Troy Hiemer, Cynthia Alarcón, Katherine Lopez, and Charlie Bahr. 

Evelyn Kusek was the first female city council member and served as the first female council president in 1967 and 1968. Sandra Riley served as the second female city council president in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Beth Augustine-Schulte served as the third female city council president in 2021, 2022, and 2023.

==Geography==
Columbus is located west of Omaha and northwest of Lincoln. It is on the north side of the Loup River near its confluence with the Platte River. U.S. Highways 30 and 81 intersect in the city, and the main line of the Union Pacific railroad passes through it.

The city lies at an elevation of . It is built on the flat terrain of the Platte River valley; rolling hills rise to the north of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

=== Climate ===
Columbus has a monsoonal hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;) typical of this part of Nebraska, characterized by cold, dry winters and hot, humid summers. Precipitation is concentrated between April and October with a maximum during the late spring and early summer, and averages annually.

<text>Duncan is a village in Platte County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 351 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The transcontinental railroad reached the site of Duncan in 1866. Among the first settlers in the area were Polish and Swiss immigrants.
In June 1869, the post office of Cherry Hill was established on the site.

In October 1871, the townsite of Jackson was laid out by officials of the Union Pacific Railroad. Jackson was chosen in 1879 as the southern terminus of the Omaha, Niobrara, and Black Hills Railroad, a Union Pacific subsidiary, purportedly because railroad magnate Jay Gould was angry at the town of Columbus for promoting a rival railroad in the region.

In 1880, the settlement&#x27;s name was changed to Duncan,
owing to the existence of another Jackson in Dakota County.
The new name honored General Wood B. Duncan, a prominent onetime local resident.
In the following year, an ice jam destroyed the Omaha, Niobrara, and Black Hills Railroad bridge across the Loup River; the line was later moved to branch off the main line of the Union Pacific at Columbus.

A Baptist church was organized in Duncan in 1881. 
In the following year, St. Stanislaus Church was built by the Polish Roman Catholics of the Duncan area.
In 1883, St. Paul&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church was established.

The Village of Duncan was incorporated in 1913.

===Landmarks===
The former route of the Lincoln Highway on the north side of the railroad tracks can still be seen today. A concrete marker at the southeast corner of 8th Street and Main Avenue indicates the northeastern end of a section that has not changed significantly since the 1920s. This section of road, including the marker and an avenue of hackberry trees through which the old highway passed just south of downtown Duncan, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as Lincoln Highway-Duncan West.

===Religion===
The only remaining organized church in Duncan is St. Stanislaus Catholic Church.
The current church was built in 1939; the patron saint&#x27;s name is inscribed on the cornerstone in Polish.

In the past 25 years, many changes have taken place in the parish. 1971 saw the formation of the first Parish Council which assists the pastor and congregation in decision making and leadership. A parish center was constructed and dedicated in 1979. Also in 1980, a senior citizen group named the Golden Age Club was formed.

Plans for the church&#x27;s future include ongoing remodeling for the old parish hall, recently renamed Pulaski Hall. In the fall of 1992 a church youth group was formed for the parish&#x27;s high school students. Membership currently is about 25 youth who once a year transform Pulaski Hall into a &quot;Haunted Hall&quot; at Halloween as one of their fundraisers. The group promotes fellowship and responsibility.

===Fairs and festivals===

Along with the fire department, it is also sponsored by Duncan Wrestling members.

==Transportation==
Duncan lies on the natural overland route across Nebraska running up the Platte and the Loup valleys, and transportation has always been a major factor in its history.

The village is located on the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, running into and out of Columbus with 60 freight trains daily. The railroad carries 60,000 inbound cars (excluding through cars) and 40,000 outbound cars annually.

In 1913, the cross-country Lincoln Highway was established. The highway, which paralleled the Union Pacific tracks through Duncan, was enthusiastically supported by the citizenry. It ran through central Duncan until 1928, when it was shifted to the south side of the tracks in order to eliminate grade-level crossings between Columbus and Grand Island. The south-side route is now used by U.S. Highway 30.
