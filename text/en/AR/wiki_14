==History of Mount Rainier==
(Drawn from &quot;History of Mount Rainier&quot;.)

In 1891, the City of Mount Rainier was named by a group of developers after the famous mountain in the state of Washington.

In 1899, the streetcar lines were extended from Washington D.C. through Hyattsville, Maryland. The Mount Rainier stop was located at the intersection of what is now known as Rhode Island Avenue and 34th Street. It was called the District Line Station. With the stop at Mount Rainier, it was easier to attract developers and prospective buyers because now the city offered easy access to get into and out of Washington.

Houses started to be built near the District Line Station after 1902. The homes in Mount Rainier were considered affordable, ranging from $2,000 to $5,000.

The business district aggregated around the streetcar station. In addition to the station, there were shops, grocery stores, a barbershop, laundry, and dry good stores. The first post office was established in 1904.

In 1910, the residents in the area around the streetcar station petitioned the Maryland State Legislature to incorporate Mount Rainier, and the city was incorporated by a charter granted on April 14, 1910.

In January 1912, the Mount Rainier volunteer fire department was created. The fire department was first located in a frame building and later moved to a brick structure located on 34th at Shepherd St.

In 1913, the Women&#x27;s Civic League of Mount Rainier formed. In 1923, the first public school of Mount Rainier was constructed, and in the same year, the town hired its first paid police officer because of its growing population.

In 1929, the town acquired of land, and in the following year, the Mount Rainier High School opened there.

In 1939, a new terminal was built at 34th St and Rhode Island Ave. because of a change in streetcar services.

In the 1940s, Kaywood Garden apartments were constructed along Eastern Ave., raising the population of Mount Rainier.

In 1952, a library was built. In 1956, a privately operated community pool opened. n 1958, streetcar services stopped and were replaced by bus service.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the population of the city declined.

Today, a large area of Mount Rainier is considered a historic district by the National Register of Historic Places.

In the present day, Mount Rainier still has many of the charms and attractive features that it had in the early 1900s. Residents of Mount Rainier are served by the Rhode Island Avenue &amp; Brookland - CUA Metro Station and West Hyattsville Metro Station.

==Points of interest==
Mount Rainier has been listed as a historic area due to its history as a primary streetcar suburb of Washington and the vast number of Sears houses and Craftsman-style homes, many of which have been restored.

There is a lively arts district in the town, which has made a point to provide affordable housing for artists and to showcase their work. Mount Rainier Day, held in May, is one day in which the entire community opens its doors to the public. The town has become a haven for freelance workers in the world of theater, including scenic designers, artistic directors, lighting designers, and stage directors, several of whom have received the highest DC theater honor, the Helen Hayes Award. Mount Rainier is home to the alternative folk music duo Emma&#x27;s Revolution and Joe Brewer, lead singer of the rock band [velvet] / owner of Brewer&#x27;s Arcade, which is a museum quality private collection featuring vintage 1980s era classic arcade and pinball machines. The renown Washington Glass School moved their sculptural glass studio to Mount Rainier in 2006. 

Glut, a vegetarian, worker-owned organic food cooperative, has existed since the 1960s and draws people from all over the area.

According to some sources, in 1949 at 33rd Street and Bunker Hill Road in Mount Rainier lived a child (see Robbie Mannheim) who allegedly became possessed by the devil. A local priest, Edward Hughes, took part in the exorcism. This incident became the basis for the film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. Local citizens have no recollection of this child being a resident of Mount Rainier, and a journalist eventually traced the youth to nearby Cottage City.

Carrollton was named after early Maryland settler Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a delegate to the Continental Congress and the last surviving signatory of the Declaration of Independence.

<text>North Brentwood is a town in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The population was 593 at the 2020 census. The municipality of North Brentwood is located north of Washington and is surrounded by the communities of Brentwood, Hyattsville, and Cottage City, and the nearby Mount Rainier. The Town of North Brentwood was incorporated in 1924, and was the first African-American-majority municipality in Maryland.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The town is named after the Brentwood estate built in 1817 by Robert Brent in Northeast Washington, D.C. The town was originally settled by African-American veterans of the American Civil War, who purchased lots from their former commander, Capt. Wallace A. Bartlett, beginning in 1887.

The town was developed beginning in the 1890s around the Highland Station of the Washington Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Columbia and Maryland Railway. &quot;Brentwood&quot; was created by Wallace A. Bartlett, a Civil War veteran, former foreman for the Government Printing Office, Patent Office examiner, and inventor originally from Warsaw, New York. Captain Bartlett lived in Washington, D.C., until 1887, when he purchased of farmland from Benjamin Holliday, which abutted the Highland subdivision. Bartlett built a farmhouse for his family on the land and, with two partners J. Lee Adams and Samuel J. Mills, formed the Holladay Land and Improvement Company.

In 1891, the Company platted a residential subdivision called &quot;Holladay Company&#x27;s Addition to Highland&quot; on of the Bartlett Farm. The lots were approximately by and were arranged around an irregular grid of streets. The lots in the northern part of the subdivision, which eventually would become North Brentwood, were smaller and were subject to flooding from a mill race. The first lots in the northern section were purchased in 1891 by Henry Randall, an African-American man from Anne Arundel County, who built a house on Holladay Avenue (now Rhode Island Avenue). In 1894, Randall&#x27;s son, Peter Randall, constructed a house next to his father&#x27;s. More family members moved into the community and built homes, and the area soon became known as Randallstown.

Other African-American families soon moved to the neighborhood, including the Plummer, Wallace, and Johnson families. They built two-story front-gable frame houses, as well as free-standing rowhouses. In 1898, the City and Suburban Railway was completed through Randallstown. By 1904 that name had been replaced by Brentwood. In the early 1900s, development was faster than in the southern areas also platted by Bartlett. A school and a church were built in 1904, and the Brentwood Colored Citizens Association was formed in 1907. The association helped acquire volunteers for a fire company, fire-fighting equipment, a community hall, and electric lights. After Bartlett&#x27;s neighboring development was incorporated as the town of Brentwood in 1922, Jeremiah Hawkins pushed for the incorporation of North Brentwood.

In April 1924, Delegate Charles B. Ager sponsored a bill to incorporate North Brentwood. The bill proposed a mayor, three council members, and a treasurer, all popularly elected. The bill passed the House of Delegates. The bill was put up to a vote of the proposed town&#x27;s residents on June 12, 1924, and it passed.

At the time of its incorporation, North Brentwood was the first municipality in Maryland, and possibly the United States, without any white voters.

===First election===
The town held its first election on July 7, 1924. Republican Jeremiah Hawkins ran unopposed for the town&#x27;s first mayor. Peter Randall and Frank Baden ran for Council member representing ward one. Horace Allen ran unopposed to represent ward two on the council. Julius Wheeler and Joseph L. Gordan ran for Council member representing ward three. Mahlia Brown and John Gilmore ran for treasurer. Hawkins, Randall, Allen, Wheeler, and Gilmore were elected.

===Growth===
The town continued to grow after incorporation. In September 1924, the town&#x27;s first school, a three-room schoolhouse, was built. During the 1930s and 1940s, new homes were built, mostly bungalows and brick Cape Cod houses. New streets were laid out, while the existing streets were paved, extended, and renamed.

<doc id="116549" wikidata="Q754358" url="?curid=116549" title="Oxon Hill-Glassmanor, Maryland">
<text>Oxon Hill-Glassmanor was a census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, for the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The combination is arbitrary, and in the mind of most local people there are two separate communities: Oxon Hill and Glassmanor. As of the 2010 census, Oxon Hill, National Harbor and Glassmanor were delineated as separate CDPs.

==History of Oxon Hill==
Oxon Hill was named for the 18th Century manor home of Thomas Addison (which burned in 1895 but was replaced by another large Georgian-style home called &quot;Oxon Hill Manor,&quot; now publicly owned, which has a river view). The community is bisected by the Capital Beltway (I-95/495) and is near the interstate Woodrow Wilson Bridge, whose gridlocked traffic (300,000 vehicles daily) backs-up daily into Oxon Hill until the wider replacement bridge is fully completed in 2008, bringing relief. (Thousands of white-collar commuters working in Northern Virginia&#x27;s booming economy find that housing is cheaper in Prince George&#x27;s County.)

Oxon Hill includes many garden apartment communities along with single-family detached homes dating mostly from the 1940s through the 1980s, including the incorporated town Forest Heights. In earlier decades, many residents were scientists from the adjacent U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, but very few are now. Oxon Hill&#x27;s two principal shopping centers (&quot;Rivertowne&quot; and the much older &quot;Eastover&quot;) attract neighborhood customers as well as shoppers from nearby Southeast Washington. Eastover, located at the D.C. state line, is a hub of many bus routes, some of them operating 24 hours a day, and has a Prince George&#x27;s County Police station.

==Geography==
Oxon Hill-Glassmanor is located at (38.802513, −76.975538).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the place had a total area of , all of it land.

<doc id="116550" wikidata="Q754948" url="?curid=116550" title="Riverdale Park, Maryland">
<text>Riverdale Park, formerly known and often referred to as Riverdale, is a semi-urban town in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, a suburb in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. The population was 6,955 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The population as of 2019 is approximately 7,304, according to the US Census Bureau and other entities.

== History ==

Riverdale Park and the neighboring community of West Riverdale developed in the late 19th century as streetcar suburbs in central Prince George&#x27;s County. The town is located approximately seven miles northeast of downtown Washington, D.C. The area is also bisected by the heavily traveled Baltimore Avenue (U.S. Route 1). The city of College Park is located to the north, the town of University Park to the west across Baltimore Avenue, the town of Edmonston to the east and southeast, and Hyattsville is located to the south and southwest.

=== Founding ===
The area was first developed in 1801 when a Belgian aristocrat, Henri Joseph Stier, purchased 800 acres situated between two tributaries of the Anacostia River, known as the Paint and Northwest branches. Stier and his family moved to the United States several years earlier to escape the French Revolution (1788–1789). Upon purchase, he named his holdings Riversdale, and began constructing his residence that same year. The mansion was modeled after the Stier family&#x27;s Belgian home, Chateau du Mick, and when completed in 1807, the building stood as a two-story stuccoed-brick dwelling in the style of late Georgian architecture.

Just two years after purchasing the property, in 1803, the political tension that had caused Stier to flee his native country subsided, and he and his wife, Marie Louise, returned to Belgium. Riversdale was given to their daughter, Rosalie, who had married George Calvert, the grandson of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, in 1799. After Rosalie Stier Calvert died in 1821 and George Calvert in 1838, their son, Charles Benedict Calvert, took over the plantation. Charles Calvert was a renowned agriculturist and helped establish the Maryland Agricultural College, now the University of Maryland at College Park. In May 1853, Calvert announced he would donate land for an agricultural college. In 1861, Calvert was elected to the United States Congress and fought for the establishment of the United States Department of Agriculture. During his life, Charles Calvert conducted a variety of agricultural experiments at Riversdale, and expanded his family&#x27;s original holdings to 2,200 acres. Calvert died in 1864; however, the property remained in the ownership of the Calvert family for another twenty years.

The 1861 Martenet map depicts the rural setting of Riversdale and identifies Charles B. Calvert as its owner. The old Baltimore Turnpike, now known as US Route 1, is located to the west of the mansion house. To the east of the house is the Washington Branch of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, which opened in 1833. The railway is located inside the boundaries of Riverdale Park, just west of the Paint Branch tributary. The 1878 Hopkins map depicts little development having had happened since 1861.

===Post-Calverts===

In 1887, the heirs of Charles Benedict Calvert sold 474 acres of land to New York City businessmen John Fox and Alexander Lutz in two separate transactions. The first deed involved the sale of 300 acres, which included the Riversdale mansion. The remaining 174 acres were transferred to Fox and Lutz shortly thereafter. The cost of the sales to Fox and Lutz totaled $47,000. On March 23, 1889, Fox and Lutz formed the Riverdale Park Company, which was named in honor of the grand Federal style mansion at the center of the proposed community. The company planned on creating an upper-middle-class residential suburb for people working in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.

The land was platted in 1889 by surveyor D.J. Howell and the new development was named Riverdale Park. In an attempt to differentiate the historic plantation known as Riversdale from the subdivision, the &quot;s&quot; was dropped. The new roads were named in honor of United States presidents and were arranged in a grid pattern that surrounded a central ellipse, which served as the site of the commuter train station. The first of the stations was constructed in 1890. Laid out as a &quot;villa park&quot;, the community featured traffic circles and green space, with the mansion being used as its central amenity. The three original sections of the suburb used relatively uniform lot dimensions and building setbacks, thereby creating a cohesive development of middle- and upper-middle-class housing. The residential housing lots surrounded the high-style Riversdale mansion.

===Growth===

The construction of dwellings in Riverdale Park began in 1890. The buildings reflected popular architectural trends of the time and were of wood-frame construction. Some structures were pyramidal-roof Foursquares, while others had front-gable or cross-gable roofs. Many houses from this period have projecting bays, corner towers, and wrap-around porches. By the turn of the twentieth century, Riverdale Park comprised 60 dwellings, a Presbyterian church, a schoolhouse, and a railroad station. The new community straddled the Washington line of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, which provided residents an easy commute to Washington, D.C.

Recognizing the financial potential of the new suburb, builders purchased groups of lots that were soon improved by high-style single-family dwellings. Joseph A. Blundon (ca. 1847–1909) was one such late-nineteenth-century builder. Born in Georgetown, Blundon worked as a general contractor in Washington, D.C., before moving to Riverdale Park in 1889. He was instrumental in forming the Riverdale Park Company and served as its first manager. Blundon also, independent of the development company, purchased several lots each year for the purpose of overseeing the construction of single-family dwellings. Between 1891 and 1909, he was responsible for the erection of roughly 90 buildings in Riverdale Park. Accordingly, he became known as the &quot;Father of Riverdale&quot;.

In 1920, a handful of owners in both Riverdale Park and the nearby West Riverdale petitioned the Maryland General Assembly requesting authority to incorporate the two neighborhoods as a municipality. On June 14, 1920, the two communities were incorporated as the Town of Riverdale. As a result of the transfer of power from the Riverdale Park Company to the municipal government, the importance of the real estate company began to diminish, prompting a financial strain. Within ten years of the town&#x27;s incorporation, the Riverdale Park Company went bankrupt.
 Numerous annexations in the mid-twentieth century increased Riverdale&#x27;s overall size. The municipal government continued to grow and change during this period. In 1941, the town changed the name of its roads to conform to the standards of the United States Postal Service, carrying a similar pattern as those of Washington, D.C., and nearby College Park. The increasing population and commercial and governmental growth of metropolitan Washington, D.C., most notably during the last twenty years of the twentieth century, has resulted in further development of the town of Riverdale. This late-twentieth-century growth was predominantly commercial and centered along Baltimore Avenue, thereby physically and visually separating West Riverdale from Riverdale Park.

=== Post-1940s ===
Since the 1940s, the area has been a largely blue-collar town predominated by small red brick or wooden homes with porches. The area has always had a large presence of University of Maryland students, faculty, and staff residents. It also has a large and growing, professional, middle-class African American population.

The area originally had its own small town Maryland identity, but was eventually engulfed by post-World War II urban expansion, related to the growth of the University of Maryland and Washington D.C. The area is now much more of a neighborhood than an actual town. Although many of the original residents have left, there are still a significant number of original residents living in the area. Many of the original residents speak with classic Maryland accents, which has some similarities to a Baltimore accent. Washington, D.C., and its close northern and northwestern suburbs once had large blue-collar Irish populations some of this influence is still evident in the remnants of the older community.

In 1998, the town was officially renamed Riverdale Park. Today, the town is made up of a mix of housing styles, including 1960s apartment buildings, pre- and post-World War II era buildings, and dwellings from the turn of the twentieth century. The Riversdale mansion, now surrounded by eight acres, is owned by the M-NCPPC, which purchased it in 1949. The Riversdale property is bounded roughly by 48th Avenue to the west, Riverdale Road to the north, Taylor Street to the east, and Oglethorpe Street to the south.
In 2015, construction began on the Cafritz Property, the largest piece of undeveloped property in Prince George&#x27;s County. In April 2017, it opened as Riverdale Park Station, a mixed-use development located at the odd side of the 6600 to 6700 blocks on Baltimore Avenue. A major tenant of the development is the Whole Foods Market, the first to open in Prince George&#x27;s County.

<text>Seat Pleasant is an incorporated city in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, located immediately east of Washington D.C.. Per the 2020 census, the population was 4,522. Two state highways pass through the community — Maryland routes 704 (now called Martin Luther King Jr. Highway and previously named George Palmer Highway in honor of banker and community leader George Palmer) and 214 (Central Avenue). The Washington Metro&#x27;s Blue and Silver Lines are nearby. The Washington Commanders&#x27; stadium is east of Seat Pleasant, near the Capital Beltway (I-95/495).

==History==
Seat Pleasant is located on part of what had been the Williams-Berry estate. In 1850, the descendants of General Otho Holland Williams, a Revolutionary War hero, and James Berry, a mid-17th-century Puritan leader, sold it to Joseph Gregory. Seat Pleasant was developed on the dairy farm of Joseph Gregory, the farm of the Hill family, and the land of building contractor Francis Carmody, among others. In 1873, some of the land along Addison Road was subdivided into small farms and rural home sites known as Jackson&#x27;s Subdivision.

Designers of the Chesapeake Beach Railway, constructed in 1897–99 between Washington, D.C. and Chesapeake Beach, Maryland, located their first station in Maryland outside Washington on the railway&#x27;s right-of-way that traversed the Gregory property. They called the station &quot;District Line&quot;. The Columbia Railway Company operated a streetcar system that extended through Northeast Washington and terminated in Seat Pleasant at Eastern Avenue, near what is today Martin Luther King Jr. Highway. Finally, the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway passed through Seat Pleasant in 1908. In 1906, the growing number of residents in the area around the station adopted a more imaginative name for their community — Seat Pleasant, after the early Williams-Berry estate. Prior to that, the area was known as Chesapeake Junction.

Steady growth of traffic on the railway between 1900 and its peak in 1920 translated into steady development for Seat Pleasant as a railroad suburb. Subdivisions were soon created, such as Seat Pleasant, Seat Pleasant Heights, Oakmont, Palmer&#x27;s, Boyer&#x27;s Addition, and Pleasant Hills. By 1915, two churches had been organized, and a fire department had been founded. The introduction of street lighting followed in 1918. When the community was incorporated as a town in 1931, it had a school, water company, sewer connections courtesy of the District of Columbia&#x27;s sanitary system, and reliable fire protection by the Seat Pleasant Fire and Community Welfare Association. The Chesapeake Beach Railway ceased operations in 1935. In the 1980s, the old railroad roundhouse and turntable were demolished to make room for the Addison Plaza Shopping Center on Central Avenue.

Post-World War II state highway construction spurred further development. Construction of &quot;affordable&quot; housing, notably the Gregory Estates apartments in 1949, was the catalyst for the migration of African-American families from the District of Columbia; before that time, the community had been all white. The right of way of the former Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway was utilized in the early 1940s for the George Palmer Highway, later renamed the Martin Luther King Jr. Highway. The Addison Road Metro station opened for service on November 22, 1980.

Most of the testaments to the town&#x27;s past are long gone. Two that remain are the Episcopal Addison Chapel (1809) and Mount Victory Baptist Church (1908).

Seat Pleasant&#x27;s crime rate is higher than the national average. The violent crime rate, while still above average, has improved in recent years, dropping from 768.6 in 2003 to 272.2 in 2011.

<text>University Park is a town in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,454 at the 2020 census.

==History==

University Park was developed on land owned by the Deakins family since the mid-1700s. The house known as Deakins Hall or Bloomfield was constructed on the land in the 1820s or 1830s. It is located at 6404 Queens Chapel Road. The farm was purchased by the University Park Company in 1923. The extension of water and sewer lines into area at that time prompted the subdivision of the Deakins tract. The developers promised a community of single-family homes without the intrusion of commercial facilities. Restrictive covenants were placed on the deeds and all house plans had to be approved by the developers. Homebuyers were attracted to University Park due to its high elevation and lush vegetation. The developers also agreed to provide streetlights and trash removal for a 10-year period, and constructed a school in the mid-1920s.

The town was incorporated in 1936, and the current town hall is located at 6724 Baltimore Avenue, on U.S. Route 1.

By 1940, the community had grown to 293 houses. The size of the town nearly doubled between 1940 and 1950, with the construction of another 255 houses. Houses constructed during these periods include brick and wood-frame Bungalow style and revival-style structures. The last building boom occurred in the late 1950s with the construction of 300 brick ranches.

Community facilities include a police department, started in 1965, a school, and a community park. The two-room company school built in the mid-1920s was converted to a residence after the county constructed a new school building in 1928, which was replaced in 1978 with a modern facility. The town park was purchased in 1941, though its development was postponed by World War II. It was designed and developed in the early 1950s to include a sunken garden, trails, playground, tennis courts, and picnic area. The town remains without commercial properties.

The University Park Historic District, a national historic district on the National Register of Historic Places, was listed in 1997. Residents who own homes that are &quot;contributing structures&quot; to the University Park Historic District may participate in the Heritage Preservation Tax Credit Program, administered through the Maryland Historical Trust. Participants in this program receive a tax credit for a portion of the cost of certified work that maintains or rehabilitates the contributing structures. One such structure identified by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission is Bloomfield.

===September 11 attacks===

University Park lost five of its residents in the September 11 attacks: The Falkenberg/Whittington family – Charles, Zoe, and Dana Falkenberg and Leslie Whittington, died on September 11 aboard American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon during a flight from Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport.

In 1744, the town was renamed to &quot;Upper Marlborough&quot;. In the late 19th century, the town&#x27;s name changed from Upper Marlborough to Upper Marlboro. The name change is linked to a postal clerk who felt that the last three letters, &quot;ugh&quot;, did not properly fit on the rubber stamps being used at the time. By 1893, postal guides were referring to the town as Upper Marlboro, though it took several more decades for the new spelling to become widely accepted among residents. Even as late as 1925, the old spelling still saw widespread unofficial usage. Despite a proposed ballot to have it formally changed back in 1968, the new name stuck, and by 1971, the old spelling, while not completely vanquished, had become severely depreciated.

==History==
The area of Upper Marlboro was first settled around 1695. It was named after John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, an ancestor of Winston Churchill. The land, which was to become the town, was part of several estates known as Grove Landing, Meadows, and Darnall&#x27;s Chance, owned by the Brooke, Beall, and Darnall families, respectively.

Darnall&#x27;s Chance, also known as the Buck House, Buck-Wardrop House, or James Wardrop House, is a historic home located at 14800 Governor Oden Bowie Drive, in Upper Marlboro. It is named after Colonel Henry Darnall, a wealthy Roman Catholic planter, who was the Proprietary Agent of Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore and who served for a time as Deputy Governor of the Province. The house itself was built c. 1742 by a merchant named James Wardrop, after he bought some of the land from Eleanor Darnall Carroll and her husband. Today, Darnall&#x27;s Chance houses the Darnall&#x27;s Chance House Museum, an historic house museum that opened to the public in 1988.

In 1706, Marlborough Town was established as a port town by the Act for the Advancement of Trade and Erecting Ports and Towns. It was declared that the town would be constructed, &quot;at the upper landing on the Western Branch, commonly called Colonel Belt&#x27;s landing.&quot; County surveyor Thomas Truman Greenfield conducted a survey of of the three estates from which the town would be formed. Streets, alleys, a meetinghouse, lots for small businesses, and 100 lots to be used for homes were laid out. The earliest plans showed the town being laid out in a grid pattern with an L shape. In 1718 residents asked the county government&#x27;s general assembly, then based in Charles Town, via petition to move the county seat to Upper Marlboro. The county seat has been there since that time.

Residents of the area were not happy with Greenfield&#x27;s initial layout and petitioned the General Assembly to have the town replatted. In 1744, the new survey was approved and the town was given a new name, Upper Marlborough. Upper was added to distinguish the town from the community of Marlboro (now known as Lower Marlboro) in Calvert County.

Early in its life, when the western branch of the Patuxent River was still navigable, the town served as a port town for tobacco ships. The town blossomed into an agricultural, social, and political hot spot. Farms, many of which raised tobacco, dominated the surrounding areas.

In 1721, a courthouse was constructed in the town. The county seat was then moved from Charles Town, on the banks of the Patuxent, to Upper Marlborough. The courthouse was built with money from a 12-pound tobacco tax imposed on county inhabitants. One of the first laws passed at the courthouse was the Public School Act, which established a public school system.

In 1814, Upper Marlboro was seized by British forces under the command of Major-General Robert Ross and Rear Admiral George Cockburn during the campaign leading up to the Battle of Bladensburg and the Burning of Washington.

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, many prominent merchants, lawyers, and politicians lived and worked in the area. Horse racing came to the town around the mid-18th century and attracted many people from the surrounding areas. The Maryland Jockey Club sponsored spring and summer races at the race track south of town, and racing continued there until 1972, when they were moved to the Bowie Race Track. The race track is now part of the Equestrian Center owned by Prince George&#x27;s County.

In 1870, the town was incorporated by the Maryland General Assembly. A volunteer fire department was organized in 1886, and the Marlborough Fire Association was incorporated the following year.

In 1878, Michael Green, an African-American man accused of assaulting a white woman, was taken from the country jail and hanged from a tree outside of town. An &quot;iron bridge just between the town and the railroad depot&quot; was the site of two more lynchings. Joseph Vermillion was killed there in 1889 and Stephen Williams met the same fate in 1894.

Since its initial conception, the town has changed quite a bit. It initially boomed as a port town for tobacco trade, but the clearing and cultivation of land for farming would lead to erosion in the area. Over the years this erosion caused sedimentation, leading the Western Branch to become unnavigable. The fields of tobacco that once dominated the area have been converted over to residential developments, with the number of farms dwindling each year.

As it is Prince George&#x27;s county seat, located within the town are the Prince George&#x27;s County Courthouse, County Administration Building, the Board of Education, and the headquarters of the Prince George&#x27;s County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The town&#x27;s atmosphere is remarkably different, depending on the time of day.

===Prince George&#x27;s County courthouse===
The courthouse has been a critical part of the town since it became the county seat in 1721. Since then, the courthouse in Upper Marlboro has seen many changes. Between 1798 and 1801, a new courthouse was constructed on the site of the old one. The courthouse was again rebuilt in the 1880s.

In 1939, the courthouse was substantially expanded and rebuilt. During this time, the building gained its famous stone Ionic columns. According to county historian Susan Pearl, &quot;They wanted the neo-classic Georgian university campus building, and that&#x27;s what they got.&quot; The total cost of the revision was $178,000.

Small additions were made in 1947 and 1969.

In the early 1990s, a new courthouse was erected behind the existing courthouse. The new courthouse, composed of the Marbury and Bourne wing, was completed in 1991. The new building occupies of space and cost $80 million. The old courthouse was then designated as the Duvall Wing and was attached to the new section by walkways.

In May 2003, the old courthouse was closed for a $25 million renovation. On November 3, 2004, two months before the building was scheduled to reopen, a fire broke out and destroyed much of the building. The fire left only a charred skeleton of the cupola, which had overlooked Main Street for 64 years.

In January 2007, the courthouse briefly caught fire again when sparks from a construction worker&#x27;s welding tool ignited building materials on the roof. Firefighters quickly contained the blaze, and the renovations continued.

On March 12, 2009, the Duvall Wing of the Prince George&#x27;s County Courthouse reopened after being closed in 2001 for renovations.

===Proposed move to Largo===
Since the 1990s, the Prince George&#x27;s County government has been purchasing land in Largo, Maryland, due to its convenient location near the Washington Metro and interstate highways. In 2015, County Executive Rushern Baker recommended the move of the county&#x27;s seat from Upper Marlboro to Largo so that residents could be better served.

<text>Woodmore is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP 86710) in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 4,513. The CDP is located within the boundaries of Route 193 (Enterprise Road) to the west, Church Road to the east, Route 214 (Central Avenue) to the south and Route 50 to the north. Woodmore Road runs east and west through the center. It contains a large gated community and country club, developments of Woodmore Meadows, and Woodmore South on the south side, as well as various other custom built homes and farmland.

Off Enterprise Road sits the development of Kingsford. It is contiguous with Mitchellville, Maryland CDP, and historically had a Mitchellville mailing address, for many years served by the South Bowie/Mitchellville Post Office with zip code 20721 and has been considered part of Mitchellville. The Woodmore and Mitchellville community is notable as one of the most affluent predominantly African-American communities in the United States.

The gated community &quot;Woodmore&quot; is centered on the Country Club at Woodmore. The community is planned to consist of 398 single-family homes on . Six Flags America is within the boundaries of the CDP.

== History ==
The first colonial owner of the Woodmore site was Thomas Spriggs, who in 1698 acquired of what was then known as the forest of Prince George&#x27;s County in the Crown Colony of Maryland.

The first house in the area was a two-story brick house named Pleasant Prospect (still standing at 12806 Woodmore Road)., built c. 1798 by Dr. Isaac Ducket, the husband of Spriggs&#x27; granddaughter. He also doubled the size of the estate to over 1,000 acres.

Pleasant Prospect was inherited by Ducket&#x27;s son-in-law, John Contee, and then by his son, also John Contee, who became indebted and sold the estate to the Bowies, then the Washington D.C. lumber magnates the Walkers. Although the Walker family sold the house in 1982, Walker descendants also continued to own land and farm on the south side of Woodmore Road, part of which farmland was sold to create Woodmore Meadows.

Much of the land in Woodmore prior to the 1980s was owned by various farming families, the most prominent of which being the Walker family and the Shatenstein family, the latter of which owned large tracts of land along the northern and southern boundaries of Woodmore Road.

In 1977 a portion of the Shatenstein property located along the northern boundary of Woodmore Road, was purchased by the County to replace the former Prince George&#x27;s Golf and Country Club, formerly located in Cheverly. The Country Club at Woodmore was designed and the gated community planned through a joint venture between the County and GolfAmerica, a process which took 15 years as the seven area homeowner associations eventually merged. In 1995, the residue of the Shatenstein estate on the southern boundary was sold to Winchester Homes, who developed the Woodmore South community. In 2010 the U.S. Census Bureau redefined northern parts of the Woodmore CDP as the new Fairwood CDP.

==History==

Centreville&#x27;s name was derived from the relocation of the county seat in 1782 from Queenstown to a more central part of the county.

Saint Paul&#x27;s Parish was established on the site that would later become known as Centreville, Maryland. It was almost 100 years later, in 1782, that the Maryland State Assembly passed an Act to relocate both the courthouse and all government functions of the county to Centreville from Queenstown, making Centreville the new county seat.

However, it took a decade for the appropriate land to be acquired and for the change to take place. A plantation called Chesterfield was chosen as the land to use for the new town which would hold the county&#x27;s courthouse. Once the town and court house were completed, on the first of June 1796, the county court, &quot;ordered [the courthouse] to be ‘taken, held and deemed to be the proper Court House of Queen Anne&#x27;s County’&quot;.

In 1782, the Queen Anne&#x27;s county courthouse was moved from its original location in Queenstown, Maryland to an area that would, twelve years later, be named Centreville. The building&#x27;s location, at the head of the Corsica River, encouraged population growth in the area.

Centreville became an incorporated town in 1794, two years after the courthouse was completed. At the same time, the town laid out, including four streets that remain today: MD 213, S. Liberty St., N. Commerce St., Water St. (MD 304).

Once Centreville was officially home to Queen Anne&#x27;s county government, lawmakers and officials decided it was appropriate to name the new town in accordance with the new location. Centreville (named partly due to the town&#x27;s central location) was also chosen because of its prime location on the Corsica River. Easy access to shipping, trading, and naval waters allowed the town to flourish and to become an important Maryland location.

Today, Centreville is the largest town in Queen Anne&#x27;s county, with a population of 2,097. 2017 has become an all time high for the small town, with a population of 4,767. The Maryland Municipal League&#x27;s Website, &quot;The Association of Cities and Towns&quot;, notes that Centreville&#x27;s, &quot;[h]istory is reflected in the diverse architecture seen along the streets of the town—elegant Victorian homes with their wrap-around porches, neo-classical public buildings, late-19th-century commercial rows, late-20th-century institutional and government structures, and all the variations and curiosities in between&quot;.

Much of the town was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Centreville Historic District in 2004.

In addition to the Centreville Historic District, Bachelor&#x27;s Hope, Captain&#x27;s Houses, Centreville Armory, Jackson Collins House, Content, Female Seminary, Keating House, Lansdowne, Lexon, Capt. John H. Ozmon Store, Readbourne, Reed&#x27;s Creek Farm, and Stratton are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

&quot;Centreville was the home of American Impressionist painters Charles M. West and Anne Warner West. Charles was born in Centreville and educated at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he met fellow student Anne Dickie Warner, a native of Wilmington, Delaware. The West Gallery includes a collection of their paintings, many depicting local subjects such as watermen at work, historic buildings and daily life in Centreville.&quot;
Charles taught painting and sculpture at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland and is best known for his painting &quot;The Narrows&quot; which was exhibited alongside Edward Hopper and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe


==Transportation==
The main means of travel to and from Centreville is by road, and four state highways serve the town. The most prominent of these is Maryland Route 213, which serves as the primary road serving local communities along the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Other state highways serving Centreville include Maryland Route 18, Maryland Route 304 and Maryland Route 305. U.S. Route 301 passes to the southeast, providing a high-speed highway to metropolitan areas such as Philadelphia and Washington D.C..

==Courthouse==
The oldest courthouse in continuous use, and one of two 18th century courthouses in Maryland, the Queen Anne&#x27;s County Courthouse is located at 120 North Commerce Street. The location for the courthouse, and for the town of Centreville, was a piece of land on which Judge Joseph Hopper Nicholson lived on at the time. In 1792 the Flemish-bond brick building was completed. At the time it was composed of four rooms, two in the center and one on each side. The courthouse&#x27;s use was increasing, so, in 1876 it was renovated and remodeled to add more space. An iron balcony was also added to the second story.

A unique feature of the courthouse is a gold eagle on the main building&#x27;s rooftop. The eagle is thought to be symbolic of America&#x27;s freedom from England and relays the idea of independence. In Judge John W. Sause, Jr.&#x27;s essay, &quot;Why the Eagle&quot;, he connects the idea of freedom and the importance of the United States’ seal to the courthouse&#x27;s eagle. Here, he writes, &quot;Executed by an unknown hand, undoubtedly that of an artisan rather than an artist...our eagle looked down upon the comings and going of the courtyard, the tears and smiles of its citizens and the successes and failures of the political system which it was designed to represent&quot;.

A statue of Queen Anne of England, the county&#x27;s namesake, sits in front of the courthouse. Princess Anne, daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, attended the dedication (1977).

Today, the courthouse remains an important figure in Centreville, Queen Anne&#x27;s County, and the state of Maryland. Keeping true to its original form, the building&#x27;s exterior is true to its original look.

<text>Crisfield is a city in Somerset County, Maryland, United States, located on the Tangier Sound, an arm of the Chesapeake Bay. The population was 2,515 at the 2020 census. It is included in the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. Crisfield has the distinction of being the southernmost incorporated city in Maryland.

The site of today&#x27;s Crisfield was initially a small fishing village called Annemessex Neck. During European colonization, it was renamed Somers Cove, after Benjamin Summers. When the business potential for seafood was discovered, John W. Crisfield decided to bring the Pennsylvania Railroad to Crisfield, and the quiet fishing town grew. Crisfield is now known as the &quot;Seafood Capital of the World&quot;. The city&#x27;s success was so great that the train soot and oyster shells prompted the extension of the city&#x27;s land into the marshes. City residents often claim that the downtown area is literally built atop oyster shells.

Crisfield began to slip into decline along with the declining health of the Chesapeake Bay, prompting a &quot;strategic revitalization plan&quot; to address the city&#x27;s future needs. Currently, Crisfield is largely a tourist destination. It hosts many annual events and festivals, the most prominent of which is the National Hard Crab Derby. Crisfield is also a major gateway to Smith Island and Tangier Island.

==History==

The Annamessex, a Native American tribe related to the Pocomoke people, were indigenous to the region. Their small fishing village was known as Annemessex Neck. The nearby Annemessex River is also named after them.

On February 10, 1663, Benjamin Summers, a settler from Yorkshire or Hertfordshire, England, arrived from Northampton County, Virginia to claim his headright. He patented a [though in actuality only ] parcel of land, which he named &quot;Emmessex&quot;. He later patented another of land on September 23, 1683, naming it &quot;Musketa Hummock&quot;. Both of these plots of land are located in the present-day Crisfield Election District. Another plot of land, named &quot;Little Worth&quot; and totalling , was also patented in Annemessex. These three plots of land would eventually come to be known collectively as Somers Cove.

Somers Cove soon became a major East Coast distribution center for seafood. The town grew faster than other settlements on the Delmarva Peninsula, with over 100 buildings in 1804, while Princess Anne and Salisbury had 40 and 4 respectively.

In 1854, a survey of the Chesapeake Bay revealed that the area was a lucrative fishing location, with extensive oyster beds around Somers Cove.

In 1866, John W. Crisfield, a Princess Anne attorney, was instrumental in bringing the Eastern Shore Railroad, a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad system, to the Somers Cove seaport. The Crisfield Secondary Branch of the railroad opened on November 6 of that year. The town was formally incorporated in 1872 as a city, and renamed Crisfield in honor of the attorney&#x27;s efforts. The railroad bolstered the economy of the new city and Crisfield prospered greatly, as did other towns and settlements along its route, such as Marion Station to the north.

Seafood was soon being shipped all over the United States, and Crisfield became known as the &quot;Seafood Capital of the World&quot;, a nickname still carried by the city. An industrial boom followed. By 1904, the City of Crisfield was the second largest city in Maryland, after Baltimore, with the population topping off at about 25,000 at that time. The city&#x27;s seafood industry attracted new residents from as far away as New England and the Midwestern United States. The city also had a baseball team before long: the Crisfield Crabbers, who played in the Eastern Shore Baseball League.

The success of the city&#x27;s seafood industry filled the city with train soot and large quantities of oyster shells. Around the turn of the 20th century, businessmen would buy plots of land at the southwest edge of the city and discard the shells and soot into the salt marshes. This shell midden eventually grew to become a peninsula roughly a half-mile long. Downtown Crisfield was built atop this new land, and this leads to the common statement that Crisfield was so prosperous that it is &quot;literally built on top of oyster shells&quot;.

James Reed, an African American native to North Carolina was lynched by a mob of whites in Crisfield, Maryland on July 28, 1907. He was thought to have killed the local police chief.

The city experienced several fires, the most well-known of which is known as the Great Fire of 1928. It began on March 29 at the Crisfield Opera House and quickly spread to the downtown area, completely destroying it and causing over $1 million in damages.

Crisfield&#x27;s prosperity began to decline along with the health of the Chesapeake Bay. Oyster populations declined to the point where the watermen could no longer fully support themselves on their daily catches. Some businesses began to move out of Crisfield, while others shut down. On April 1, 1976, the railroad that had brought prosperity to Crisfield was abandoned as Conrail was established. However, Maryland Route 413, a new, straight vehicular highway was built before the railroad was abandoned, along the railroad right-of-way. As large businesses in the United States grew, they passed the shrinking Crisfield by until the late 20th century. Fast-food restaurants began to slowly find business in the city, starting in the late 1990s, alongside the many seafood restaurants already in town. A large supermarket had been in city plans for a decade, though it wasn&#x27;t until April 2010 that it opened for business. Crisfield has also been a target for large waterfront properties, with several large condominiums being built in the mid-2000s in the downtown area, along with other places flanking Crisfield&#x27;s harbors. A &quot;strategic revitalization plan&quot; has been in the works since 2006 to address future growing needs and beautification of the city.

Crisfield is known for its seafood, particularly Atlantic blue crab, and it abounds with restaurants, seafood packing houses, and seafood distribution companies. Several seafood restaurants across the country carry the city&#x27;s name.

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy affected the town as many businesses and homes were flooded.

The Crisfield Armory, Crisfield Historic District, Cullen Homestead Historic District, Make Peace, Nelson Homestead, Capt. Leonard Tawes House, and Ward Brothers&#x27; House and Shop are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

Crisfield is a very compact city, with little vacant land. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which (53.0%) is land and (47.0%) is water. As one of the southern points on the Delmarva Peninsula and one very close to the Chesapeake Bay, the city is extremely flat, with the elevation never rising above .

The city of Crisfield is surrounded by salt marshes and was built on a floodplain. The downtown is especially prone to flooding during large storms and hurricanes. On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy&#x27;s storm surge left most of the city underwater. Ongoing local concerns about flooding and the impact of sea level rise were featured in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in October 2013.

Crisfield is the southernmost city in the state of Maryland; the point farthest south is geographically located at Ape Hole. Regardless of this, Southern Maryland is an official region of the state not associated with the Eastern Shore, and areas of Saint Mary&#x27;s County are sometimes claimed to be the southernmost point of the state.
===Climate===
Crisfield&#x27;s location on the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland gives it a humid subtropical climate, with hot, humid summers and cool to mild winters. Its proximity to water, as well as a common trend on the Delmarva Peninsula, means that the city does not see much snowfall in the winters; meaning Crisfield as well as Inner Harbor Baltimore, and the border of Assateague Island on the Atlantic Barrier Island are the only hardiness zone 8a examples in Maryland.

==Demographics==

Crisfield is part of the Salisbury-Ocean Pines CSA, a combined statistical area (CSA) which includes the Salisbury metropolitan area (Somerset and Wicomico counties) and the Ocean Pines micropolitan area (Worcester County), which had a combined population of 155,934 at the 2000 census. Salisbury is the principal city of this CSA.

===Crime===
Crisfield gained a new police chief in 2007—Chief Michael L. Tabor, who retired from the Baltimore Police Department to head law enforcement in the city. Since then, crime rates have been on a steady decline, generally halving between 2006 and 2008. The most prevalent crime in the city is property crime, down from a high of 180 in 2006 to 92 in 2008. Theft is also very common. Violent crimes, such as murder and forcible rape, are rare, though the numbers for those are on the decline as well. In January 2010, it was reported that Crisfield experienced an 81% decrease in crime rates of all kinds since 2007.

==Economy==
Crisfield&#x27;s economy is centered largely around retail, health care, and automotive. Seafood is also an important part of Crisfield&#x27;s economy, just as it has been for most of its existence, with several packing plants existing within the city. In 1997, the company CrabPlace.com began selling seafood online, caught by local watermen.

The largest employer inside Crisfield&#x27;s limits is the McCready Memorial Hospital. The second largest employer in the city is the Sherwin-Williams plant (formerly Rubberset company), which manufactures paintbrushes and roller covers.

In the past, the economy was centered on the watermen and seafood. About 150 seafood processing and packing plants were located within the city in its heyday. As the health of the Chesapeake Bay began to decline, so did the numbers for the blue crab catch, which have fallen by 70% since the 1990s. Regulations have been placed on harvest of female crabs in order to control overharvesting.

Most of the labor force in Crisfield works outside of the city and elsewhere on the peninsula—the largest seafood employer in Somerset County is located nearby in Hopewell. Additionally, a new industrial park, slated for construction as early as September 2013 just north of Crisfield, near Carvel Hall and along MD 413, will expand Crisfield&#x27;s corporate limits.

==Culture==
Due to Crisfield being the main access point to Smith Island, it is an area with many speakers of the unique Smith Island accent. It also serves Smith Island cake, the Maryland state dessert, in many of its restaurants.

===Annual events===
Since 1986, Crisfield has hosted the Scorchy Tawes Pro-Am Fishing Tournament. The 3-day tournament features cash prizes for different fishing categories, and nightly block-parties at Side Street Restaurant.

The annual J. Millard Tawes Crab and Clam Bake takes place in September each year. The event, which began in 1976, is named for the former governor born in Crisfield, and attracts many politicians from across the state each year.

Crisfield&#x27;s largest event is the annual National Hard Crab Derby &amp; Fair, held every Labor Day weekend, which began in 1947. Major highlights of the Crab Derby include a parade through Main Street, the Little Miss, Little Mr. and Miss Crustacean Pageants, the Boat Docking Contest (which began in 1971), the Crab Picking contest, and the Crab Bowl. The Crab Bowl turns the Somers Cove Marina into fairgrounds with rides, concerts, vendor stands, and fireworks.

===Museums===
Crisfield has several museums: the J. Millard Tawes Historical Museum, the Ward Brothers Workshop, and the J. Millard Tawes Library.

==Government==
Crisfield is said to have a mayor–council–manager government. Administration is handled by the City Manager, who is appointed by the mayor and city council. The mayor is elected by the citizens of Crisfield, and the council members are as well. All serve four-year terms.

==Sports and recreation==
The city once had a minor league baseball team: the Crisfield Crabbers, who played in now-defunct Eastern Shore Baseball League. Several little league baseball and high school sports teams remain in the city.

Wellington Beach and Park was open with life guards and concession stand in the 1980s, but closed. However, through Program Open Space, Crisfield received funding to build and reopen it. Crisfield&#x27;s public Wellington Beach and Park reopened in early 2012 as Brick Kiln Beach. However, after Hurricane Sandy hit later that year, the beach required major reconstruction. The beach was renamed and reopened to the public on June 2, 2013 at 1:00 PM. The park has a play area, a gazebo, and bathrooms during the summer months. It also is a popular crabbing spot.

Nearby Janes Island State Park is a large marshy island made of almost completely undeveloped land, and is colonized by various birds and marine life. It offers fishing, swimming beaches, picnicking, camping, a playground, and has about thirty miles of water trails which can be accessed by canoe. The beaches allow swimming as well.

==Education==

===Public schools===

Crisfield&#x27;s two public schools are part of the Somerset County Public Schools district, which is headquartered in Westover.

* Carter G. Woodson Elementary School − This school is located on South Somerset Avenue and currently serves grades K−5. This was changed from 2004, where it was the middle school, serving grades 6−8; school consolidation in the county changed the school and gave it a renovation. Much earlier than that, the school was the Crisfield Colored High School.
* Crisfield Academy and High School − Originally known as just Crisfield High School, this building is located on North Somerset Avenue between the intersections of Potomac Street and Mercury Drive, and serves grades 8−12. Before consolidation, it handled grades 9−12. The school is the first educational facility built beyond the original Crisfield Academy, and has existed in four different buildings on three different sites, all located close to or on Somerset Avenue.

==Transportation==

===Travel by water===
As Crisfield&#x27;s heritage is on the water, it has many points of access to the Tangier Sound and Chesapeake Bay.

Crisfield has two public docks. The city dock is located at the end of Main Street (MD 413). The city dock is the landing for mail ships, large commercial ships, and passenger ferries to Smith Island and Reedville, Virginia via Tangier Island. The city dock pavilion is a popular site for public events. The county dock, located one block west at the end of Broad Street, is largely used for freight, and was rehabilitated in the mid-2000s. The Little Boat Harbor, located on Brick Kiln Road is utilized mostly by smaller workboats.

Somers Cove Marina, a large marina built in Crisfield in the 1960s, is currently owned by the State of Maryland. The marina hosts many of the city&#x27;s large events, such as the National Hard Crab Derby.

Throughout Crisfield&#x27;s history, there has been discussion of a high-speed ferry link between Crisfield and the Western Shore, with large vessels that can accommodate large numbers of vehicles and tractor-trailers. The proposed site for a Western Shore landing has ranged from Point Lookout State Park in Maryland to Reedville in Northumberland County, Virginia. Proponents state that a high-speed ferry link will reduce travel times to adjacent points on the western shore by as much as two and a half hours as the Bay Bridges are far from one another, spurring tourism and economic growth on both sides. The most recent proposal came in the 2000s; however, it was deemed that a ferry would not be economically feasible. Money earmarked for the ferry service was released to the city for an upgrade of the city dock.

===Major roads===

The city of Crisfield is accessible by two main state highways: Maryland Route 413 (the main route through the city and is known colloquially as &quot;The Strip&quot;) and Maryland Route 667. Both routes connect directly to U.S. Route 13, the main north−south thoroughfare of the Delmarva Peninsula. Additionally, Maryland Route 358 (Jacksonville Road) leads to the nearby Janes Island State Park, and Maryland Route 460 (Hall Highway) is the main access point to the hospital. Maryland Route 380 (Byrdtown Road and Main Street Extension) lead to the Crisfield suburbs of Lawsonia and Byrdtown; this area is commonly referred to by the locals as &quot;Down Neck&quot;.

Major streets not maintained by the state are Somerset Avenue, which is located at the northern edge of town and travels south, paralleling the eastern city boundary and fronted mostly by homes; all of the public schools in the city are located down this corridor. There is also Main Street, which provides access to City Hall, the post office, police department, the library, and many of the businesses in the city, and also intersects Somerset Avenue at the only stoplight in the city. Main Street merges with Maryland Route 413 near the Crisfield Fire Department, becoming a four-lane boulevard. Broadway Avenue, running parallel to Main Street one block south, was once a major business center in the city as well, fronted by many businesses and churches and passed directly through the city&#x27;s marina; however, it no longer reaches the marina, and a large number of the stores and warehouses along it have closed.

===Bicycles and pedestrians===
As part of expansion of bicycle infrastructure across the state of Maryland, MD 413 inside the city limits received bicycle lanes for almost its full length in 2017. There is also a proposal to convert the abandoned Crisfield Secondary Branch alongside MD 413 to a Crisfield–Westover Rail Trail. Part of this plan included the bike lanes already installed in Crisfield.

===Public transportation===
The two bus routes serving Crisfield, Route 706 North and Route 706 South, are operated by Shore Transit, which provides the commuter bus service for the lower Eastern Shore. Both routes travel along Somerset Avenue and MD 413, and Cove Street, and stop at McCready Memorial Hospital. All buses provide access to the Princess Anne transfer hub with limited service to Salisbury; thus riders can get access to other points on the Eastern Shore.

===Airports===
The Crisfield Municipal Airport is located near Hopewell. The main access road to the airport is on Plantation Road in Hopewell, south of the MD 667 intersection there; from Crisfield it is accessible via Jacksonville Road. The airport has been a recent target for expansion.

==Infrastructure==

===Public utilities===
Crisfield possesses three water towers and a public sewer system; both provide municipal services as far north as Plantation Road in Hopewell. The most recent water tower was installed in the early 2000s. It also has a sewage water treatment plant, which is notably overburdened and obsolete.

The main electrical provider in the city is Delmarva Power, owned by Exelon, and a large substation is located north of town. Choptank Electric Cooperative also serves the city&#x27;s outskirts. In the past, Crisfield possessed a power plant, located downtown on Seventh Street. This was removed around the time of the decommissioning of the rail line, as the railroad once ended there; power is now tapped from a substation in Princess Anne via subtransmission line. The main telephone provider is Verizon Communications. In the mid-2000s, a fiber-optic cable was installed along the length of MD 413, improving internet service. A prominent cellphone tower was also installed in the center of Marion Station to the north in 2010.

===Health care===

Crisfield is currently home to the only hospital in Somerset County: McCready Memorial Hospital, accessible by Hall Highway and by Byrd Road from the north on Jacksonville Road. The next closest hospital is Peninsula Regional Medical Center in Salisbury. McCready Hospital is located on the Annemessex River, and is flanked by the Alice Byrd Tawes Nursing Home, which was built in 1968 and was replaced by a new four-story building in 2010.

==Notable people==
* Ward Brothers, famous wooden-carved, wildfowl, decoy makers
* J. Millard Tawes, 54th Governor of Maryland
* Harry Clifton Byrd, American university administrator, educator, athlete, coach, and politician

==In popular culture==

Crisfield and its environs are the setting for most of the books in the &quot;Tillerman Cycle&quot; series by Cynthia Voigt.

The movie &quot;Hookman 2&quot; was mostly filmed in Crisfield in winter 2010−2011 and was released in 2013. Crisfield is the hometown of most of the cast and crew members and is called &quot;Hometown, Maryland&quot; in the movie. The film is currently available on Amazon and YouTube.

Samantha Reilly, a character on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, portrayed by Brooke Langton, is from Crisfield, Maryland

==History==
Deal Island was historically known as Deal&#x27;s, Deil&#x27;s, and Devil&#x27;s Island. Nearby Dames Quarters also had an unappealing name: Quarters of the Damned. At least one source also attributes these nicknames to the area&#x27;s use by pirates.

The island is famous for Joshua Thomas, who predicted the British defeat in the War of 1812. Thomas is buried alongside the Joshua Thomas Chapel.

The Deal Island Historic District, Sea Gull (skipjack), and St. John&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church and Joshua Thomas Chapel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Events==
Since 1959, Deal Island has hosted an annual Labor Day weekend Skipjack Race. The race features skipjacks, which are traditional wooden sailing vessels with triangular sails, designed for dredging oysters. They are two-sail bateaux, and the term &#x27;bateau&#x27; is still preferred by watermen. These vessels were operated extensively between the 1880s to the 1960s. Deal Island was once the home port for a large fleet of skipjacks and today has most of the few remaining skipjacks operating commercially for oystering on the Chesapeake Bay.

Also, during the Labor Day weekend, there is the annual Deal Island yard sale. It begins on Saturday and continues into Monday. Participants from other communities near Deal Island are also included.

==Transportation==
Deal Island&#x27;s main road is Maryland Route 363; its entire length known as Deal Island Road. Route 363 traverses the entire island and travels due east to U.S. Route 13 in Princess Anne.

Deal Island&#x27;s communities were once served by the Somerset Commuter (now Shore Transit), on Route 4, starting from Princess Anne&#x27;s main transfer point. This route was removed in 2005.

==Notable person==
*William Daniel (1826–1897), Maryland politician, was born in Deal Island.

<text>Princess Anne is a town in Somerset County, Maryland, United States, that also serves as its county seat. Its population was 3,290 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Salisbury, Maryland–Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is home to the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and the Teackle Mansion.

==History==

The town at the head of the Manokin River was named for Princess Anne of Great Britain, daughter of King George II. Established in 1733, it serves as the county seat for Somerset County, the southernmost county in Maryland.

In the mid-18th century, the town became a market center based on the river trade and development of tobacco plantations in the area. Enslaved African Americans were used to cultivate and process this labor-intensive crop, in addition to other farming. The town&#x27;s trade was augmented by the southward extension of the Eastern Shore Railroad on Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore. At that time, the Manokin River was navigable as far as the bridge at Princess Anne.

Much of the town&#x27;s architectural heritage has been preserved. About 150 acres (0.6 km2) of the old town, with about 300 structures, is entered on the National Register of Historic Places as the Princess Anne Historic District.

In addition, the Adams Farm, Beckford, Beverly, Catalpa Farm, Glebe House, Harrington, Manokin Historic District, Manokin Presbyterian Church, Mt. Zion Memorial Church, Dr. William B. Pritchard House, Somerset Academy Archaeological Site, Teackle Mansion, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Waddy House, Waterloo, and White Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Princess Anne has the ignoble distinction of being the site of the last lynching in Maryland history. In 1933, a black man named George Armwood was accused of assaulting an elderly white woman. He was removed from the Princess Anne jail by a white mob, dragged around town behind a truck, and eventually hanged. After his death, the rope that formed the noose was cut up and distributed as a souvenir.

=== Connection to Napoleon ===
After the defeat of the French Empire at the hands of the Seventh Coalition in July 1815, emperor Napoleon I sought to flee to the United States to escape imprisonment. According to local legends, Napoleon&#x27;s brother, Jerome Bonaparte, had previously married Elizabeth Patterson, an American socialite from Baltimore, and through her the Bonapartes had connections to the American gentry, such as the King family in Beverly. According to the 1944 book &#x27;Rivers of the Eastern Shore&#x27; by Hulbert Footner, Nicholas Girod, former Mayor of New Orleans, attempted to rescue Napoleon from his exile in British Saint Helena in 1821, the plan being to hide Napoleon in Beverly House in Princess Anne before transporting him to Napoleon House in New Orleans once the hunt for him subsided. However, Napoleon died before the plot could go ahead.

==Geography==
Princess Anne is located at (38.204, –75.695).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Princess Anne has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps. Princess Anne&#x27;s climate is characterized by hot and humid stretches of weather in summer, but they are often broken up by cold fronts from the north offering several days of mild temperatures and lower humidity. Winters are relatively mild compared to areas to the north and northwest, but cold spells send temperatures well below freezing. Due to the impact of the Atlantic Ocean nearby, average snowfall amounts only range from 5 to 10 inches; however, this varies considerably from year to year and occasional nor&#x27;easters can produce significant snowfalls over one foot. The Blizzard of 2018, for example, produced 10-15 inches of snow, temperatures in teens, and winds gusting over 40 miles per hour. Tropical storms occasionally impact the region during summer and fall.

<text>Smith Island is a collection of three distinct island communities – Tylerton, Rhodes Point, and Ewell, Maryland – on the Chesapeake Bay, on the border of Maryland and Virginia territorial waters in the United States. The island is the last inhabited island in Maryland that is not accessible by car (the Virginia portion of the island is not currently inhabited). Most of the islands are eroding due to tidal currents and sea level rise; a study conducted in 2008 by the DNR reported that Smith Island is expected to completely erode by 2100 if no action is taken.

The island&#x27;s population is approximately 220, down from a peak of about 800. On its Maryland side, Smith Island is a census-designated place (CDP) in Somerset County. It is included in the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Smith Island lies approximately west of Crisfield, Maryland, across the Tangier Sound portion of the Chesapeake Bay. The island consists of three communities, namely Ewell, Tylerton, and Rhodes Point, which all sit on the Maryland portion of the island. The Virginia portion is uninhabited, although it once contained many homes of early settlers.

Although a portion of this island lies within Virginia, &quot;Smith Island, Virginia&quot; refers to a separate but identically named barrier island off Cape Charles.

=== Sea level rise ===
By the 2010s, the island had shrunk, mainly from erosion and rising sea levels. In the last 150 years, Smith Island has lost over of wetlands. The island is projected to be completely eroded by 2100 should the sea level rise by another foot. Preventative measures have been implemented, including a jetty-building project completed in 2018, and the realignment of waterways through dredging. These restoration efforts will be ongoing for the next 50 years to restore of submerged aquatic vegetation and of wetlands. Moreover, the island is building additional coastal defenses.

==Demographics==

The Smith Island CDP is located in a small town–area in the central part of the island, spread across the three villages of Ewell, Rhodes Point, and Tylerton, all located in the state of Maryland. The northern part of Smith Island also includes the Martin National Wildlife Refuge. The southernmost portion of the island, consisting of marsh, lies in Accomack County, Virginia.

As of the 2010 Census, there were 276 people residing in the Smith Island CDP. The population density was . There were 218 housing units, at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 99.6% White, 0.82% African American, 0.27% Native American, and 0.82% from two or more races. 51% of Smith Island&#x27;s residents were English, 4% Greek, 3% Irish, 3% Scottish, and 3% French.

There were 167 households, of which 19.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.5% were married couples living together, 4.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.9% were non-families. 29.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.18, and the average family size was 2.69.

The median age was 50 years, with 14.6% under the age of 18, 5.5% from 18 to 24, 22.3% from 25 to 44, 34.6% from 45 to 64, and 23.1% who were 65 years of age or older. For every 100 females, there were 95.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.8 males.

The median household income was $26,324, and the median family income was $29,375. Males had a median income of $26,250, versus $28,750 for females. The per capita income was $25,469. About 14.4% of families and 37.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.9% of those under age 18 and 67.9% of those age 65 or over.

==Transportation==
Smith Island has no airport and no bridges to the mainland; it can be accessed only by boat. Passenger-only ferries connect Smith Island at Ewell to Point Lookout, Maryland, and Reedville, Virginia, on the Western shore of the Chesapeake Bay (seasonal), and from Crisfield, Maryland, on its Eastern Shore (year-round). A daily passenger ferry also runs between Crisfield, Maryland, and the smaller island of Tylerton, Maryland.

In addition to public ferry services, guided boat tours operate between Crisfield and Smith Island, offering visitors an opportunity to explore the island’s history and culture. Experience Smith Island, a Chesapeake Bay storytelling and heritage tour operator, provides transportation to the island along with guided tours focusing on local traditions, seafood harvesting, and Smith Island cake demonstrations.

Few motor vehicles exist on the islands, and these are all in the northern community of Ewell and the connected Rhodes Point. Main modes of transportation for all three communities include golf carts as well as non-motorized transportation.

==History and language==

The island was charted by John Smith. British settlers arrived on the island in the 17th century, coming from Cornwall and Wales, as well as Dorset, England, via Virginia. The island&#x27;s population peaked in the early 1900s, at 800.

Smith Island is inhabited by one of the region&#x27;s oldest English-speaking communities, known for its relic accent, which preserves many speech patterns from the original English colonial settlers. The local dialect is like the dialects of the West Country of England, including Cornwall. The dialect contains some relict features indicative of its origins. The dialect is like the Ocracoke Brogue, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Outer Banks Brogue&quot;. However, it even more closely resembles the unique accent on the nearby Tangier Island, Virginia.

The 1940 Maryland guide described a series of economic conflicts that characterized relationships between the inhabitants of Smith Island, the inhabitants of nearby Tangier Island, and agencies of the Federal government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, although 23,000 acres of rich oyster beds had been ceded from Maryland to Virginia in 1877,

The &quot;Island Belle&quot;, a former passenger ferry to the islands, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development offered buyouts to landowners, most of whom refused the offer.

== Smith Island cake==

Smith Island traditions include a region-specific cuisine, its most famous dish being the Smith Island cake, somewhat resembling the Prinzregententorte, with eight to fifteen thin layers alternating with cooked chocolate frosting.

Beginning in the 1800s, Smith Islanders would send these cakes with the watermen on the autumn oyster harvest. The bakers began using fudge instead of buttercream frostings, as cakes frosted with fudge lasted much longer than cakes with other types of frosting.

Scratch recipes typically involve evaporated milk, while recipes based on commercial cake mixes add condensed milk.

The most common recipes yield yellow cake with chocolate frosting, but other flavor variations include coconut, fig, strawberry, lemon, and orange. Smith Island cake is baked for any occasion, a dessert that needs no holiday.

Smith Island cake is also baked as the feature prize for a local fundraising tradition called a cake walk, which is a game played like musical chairs where donated cakes serve as the prize. Great attention is paid to the perfection of the pencil-thin layers that form the distinctive cake. Before each round, the prize Smith Island cake at stake is cut in half and shown to the players, who pay to participate in the game. A poorly stacked Smith Island cake may not attract many players and, as a result, not raise as much money as a more perfectly executed cake.

Experience Smith Island, a local business offering Smith Island cake baking demonstrations, allows visitors to learn about the history of the cake while observing the baking process. Captain Everett Landon and his wife Carole Ann lead these demonstrations, providing an immersive opportunity for visitors to explore the island’s culinary heritage.

Smith Island cake became the officially designated state dessert of Maryland on April 24, 2008.

<text>Golden Beach is an upscale census-designated place (CDP) in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The population was 3,796 at the 2010 census. It consists of a small housing development with a private beach, located within the larger postal designation of Mechanicsville. One former resident was popular 1960s romantic recording artist Ronnie Dove.

==Colonial history==

A 50-acre portion of the area now named Golden Beach was a plantation called &quot;The Fishing Place&quot; which was awarded to Thomas Lamar in 1677 (because spelling varied in those days, in the grant he is called &quot;LaMare&quot;). It was one of several plantations eventually owned by Lamar but he considered it his favorite as it was his primary residence.

The original survey of one of Lamar&#x27;s parcels at Trent Creek was carried out in 1676.

A grant of land is recorded in the Maryland archives and reads:

&quot;Charles, Absolute Lord and Proprietary of the province of Maryland and Avalon Lord Baron of Baltimore, &amp;c.
 To all persons to whom these presents shall come, Greetings in our Lord God Everlasting. Know ye that we for and in consideration that Thomas LaMare of Calvert County in our said province of Maryland hath due unto him fifty acres of land within our Province ...upon such conditions and terms as are expressed in the Conditions of Plantation of our late father Cecelius of noble memory under his greater seal at Arms bearing date at London the second day of July of our Lord 1649...
 Do hereby grant unto him the said Thomas LaMare all the parcel of land called The Fishing Place situate lying and being in Calvert County on the West side of Patuxent River and North side of Trent Creek...To have and to hold the same unto him the said Thomas La Mare, his heirs and assigns forever-to be holden of us and our heirs at our receipt of St. Marries at the two most usual feasts of the year, viz: at the feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the feast of St. Michael the Arch Angel by even and equal portions the Rent of two Shilling Sterling in Silver or Gold.

<text>Leonardtown is a town in and the county seat of St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The population was 4,563 at the 2020 census.

Historic Leonardtown includes both a large public high school and a public middle school Leonardtown Middle School as well as a Catholic high school and an elementary school Leonardtown Elementary School, offices of the county government, and St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital which serves the healthcare needs of the county. The College of Southern Maryland maintains a growing satellite campus within city limits, including an aquatic center. An upscale home development located in the Breton Bay area is just outside town, notable for both its country club golf course and swimming pool.

Leonardtown&#x27;s population has grown significantly since 1990 as a result of the town&#x27;s proximity to Patuxent River Naval Air Station and the Washington metro area.

==Geography==
Leonardtown is located at (38.295332, -76.637939).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Transportation==
The primary method of travel to and from Leonardtown is by road, and three state highways serve the town directly. The most prominent of these is Maryland Route 5, which follows Point Lookout Road through Leonardtown. Heading north, MD 5 provides connections to U.S. Route 301 in Waldorf and Interstate 95/Interstate 495 (the Capital Beltway) near Washington, D.C. Heading south, MD 5 eventually reaches Point Lookout. The other two state highways serving the town directly are Maryland Route 245, which connects Leonardtown to Maryland Route 235 in Hollywood, and Maryland Route 243, which passes Compton before ending at Newtowne Neck State Park. Although not directly serving Leonardtown, MD 5 also has junctions with Maryland Route 4 and Maryland Route 234 just outside the town limits.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Records indicate that by 1654, county court was conducted at the house of John Hammond in the area known as &quot;Newtown&quot; or &quot;Newtowne Hundred&quot;. During the late 17th century, it appears that court was held at various homes throughout Newtown, and that it was only in 1708 that an official town with a designated courthouse was established. It was during this same year that Phillip Lynes, then Mayor of St. Mary&#x27;s City, Maryland&#x27;s colonial capital, designated fifty acres of land at the head of &quot;Brittons Bay&quot; to be divided into 100 lots. He further ordered that one lot be set aside for a county courthouse to be built at an expense not to exceed 12,000 pounds of tobacco. At this time, Newtown was promptly renamed Seymour Town in honor of Governor John Seymour. Nearly 20 years later, Seymour Town was renamed again to Leonard Town in honor of Benedict Leonard Calvert, who was Maryland&#x27;s governor during this period. In the decades that followed, Leonard Town became the place where local residents conducted their official business with the colony. Farm products were regularly shipped through the port.

=== The 19th century ===

During the War of 1812, the British blockaded the Chesapeake Bay. 1,000 British Marines invaded the town. This crippled the Tidewater economy and subjected areas to repeated British plundering and destruction. By 1860, the town had approximately 35 dwellings within these corporate limits. It was home to the county&#x27;s newspaper, two hotels and several stores. During the American Civil War, a Union Naval contingent occupied Leonardtown, searching all houses for weapons and supplies intended for shipment across the Potomac River to Virginia as Southern Maryland and the town&#x27;s sympathies lay with the Confederacy. Leonardtown served as a busy port and steamboat landing. Until the passing of the steamboat era, steamboats carried goods and passengers all over the Chesapeake Bay area well into the 20th century, and a floating theater docked each year at the port, providing entertainment.

=== The 20th century to the present ===

Historic Leonardtown remains the only incorporated municipality in St. Mary&#x27;s County with its own elected mayor and town council. The town is experiencing a renaissance of its downtown as witnessed by recent openings of several new restaurants and businesses, some of which are located in historic buildings. An old order Mennonite farming community is located a few miles to the northwest, where community members sell furniture, crafts, produce, and other homemade/home grown products. A large, modern public library and seniors center opened in 2021. The Leonardtown Wharf waterfront park opened as a public attraction for both locals and tourists in May 2008. Facilities for boating, kayaking and canoeing are also planned.
The Naval Air Base located at Patuxent River has boosted the economy in Leonardtown significantly. Many families have relocated to Leonardtown as a result of the base.

St. Andrew&#x27;s Church and Tudor Hall were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

The United States National Oyster Festival, which hosts an annual oyster shucking competition, has been held annually in Leonardtown since 1967.

<doc id="116588" wikidata="Q650694" url="?curid=116588" title="Lexington Park, Maryland">
<text>Lexington Park is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, and the principal community of the Lexington Park, Maryland Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 11,626 at the 2010 census.

==History==
===Native American presence===

Native American peoples inhabited the area as early as 3500 B.C. At the time of the arrival of the first colonists, the area was inhabited by tribes of the Piscataway Indian Nation, including the Yaocomico, Mattawoman, Pamunkey, Mattaponi and Nanjemoy. The Piscataway Nation, although fragmented, still exists today, and has small communities and cultural centers in other parts of the county.

===Colonial era===

The area was expanded into by &quot;planters&quot; (mostly tobacco farmers) who moved into the area as the original settlement in St. Mary&#x27;s City grew. Early plantations were first farmed by indentured and free labor, but in the late 1600s slavery began to establish itself in Maryland and the character of farming changed due to this. Wealth was concentrated in very few hands and small free farmers and laborers were pushed out or &quot;down&quot; (into poverty) due to competition with slave labor.

===Pre-1940s community===

Before the establishment of the Patuxent Naval Air Station, there were tobacco farms in what is now Lexington Park, or the base proper, and also crabbing, fishing and oyster harvesting communities in the waterfront areas. Many residents of these communities had roots going back more than 300 years in the area. Many were pushed out by eminent domain land seizures during World War Two, in order to create the new military base. Memories of this loss are still strong among older county residents. The economic boost brought by the base was welcome, but many never felt sufficiently compensated for the loss of their centuries-old homes, landholdings and fishing and farming community.

Nearby, Dashiell Hammett, noted novelist, was born on May 27, 1894.

===World War Two: Advent of naval base spurs establishment of &quot;Lexington Park&quot;===

&quot;Lexington Park&quot; came into being in 1943 with the establishment of the Patuxent Naval Air Station during World War II, and was named for the recently sunk aircraft carrier. Prior to this Lexington Park was called &quot;Jarboesville&quot;. John Glenn, Alan Shepard, and many noted astronauts trained there. In 1977 the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge spanning the Patuxent River linked the area to Calvert County and Solomons, Maryland.

In recent years several aerospace and high-tech companies have located in the area bringing additional jobs. Continually expanding shopping centers along Maryland Route 235 (&quot;Three Notch Road&quot;) and Great Mills Road have many department stores.

==Economy==

== History ==

===18th century===
The town of Easton received its official beginning from an Act of the Assembly of the Province of Maryland dated November 4, 1710. The act was entitled, &quot;An Act for the Building of a Court House for Talbot County, at Armstrong&#x27;s Old Field near Pitt&#x27;s Bridge&quot;. Pitt&#x27;s Bridge crossed a stream forming the headwaters of the Tred Avon or Third Haven River. It was located at a point where North Washington Street crosses this stream, now enclosed in culverts, north of the Talbottown Shopping Center, and passes under the Electric Plant property. Prior to this date, the court had met at York, near the mouth of Skipton Creek. The court decided that this location was not convenient to all sections of the county and, in order to change the location, the above act of the Assembly was passed. As a result of this act, two acres of land were purchased from Philemon Armstrong, at a cost of 15,000 pounds of tobacco. Upon this tract, the same plot upon which the present Talbot County Courthouse now stands, the court house, a brick building 20 x 30 feet, was erected at a cost of 115,000 pounds of tobacco. The courts of the county were held in this building from 1712 until 1794. A tavern to accommodate those who attended court was one of the first buildings erected; stores and dwellings followed. The village was then known as &quot;Talbot Court House&quot;. These were not the first buildings in the area. The frame meeting house of the Society of Friends was built between 1682 and 1684. The Wye plantation was settled in the 1650s by Welsh Puritan and wealthy planter Edward Lloyd and is owned and occupied by the 11th generation of that family.

Easton may be named because of its location east of Saint Michaels; however, it is more likely that it was named after Easton in Somerset, England.

===20th century===
In 1916, the town erected the &quot;Talbot Boys&quot; statue in honor of Confederate soldiers from Talbot County. It stood for 107 years before being removed in 2022 after years of controversy.

In 1919, Isaiah Fountain, a black farmer from Trappe, was the last person to be legally executed on the Eastern Shore. The case made national headlines and sparked outrage about racial injustice. After the first day of his trial, a mob of 2,000 assembled on courthouse grounds and attempted to grab and lynch Fountain. This is the largest incident of mob violence in Talbot County history to date.

===21st century===
In 2008, a lost painting of a Paris street scene by Édouard Cortès was discovered amongst donated items at a Goodwill Industries store in Easton. After an alert store manager noticed that it was a signed original, the painting was auctioned for $40,600 at Sotheby&#x27;s.

In 2011, local officials erected a statue of Frederick Douglass, the noted abolitionist, who was born a slave in 1818 at the Wye River plantation in northern Talbot County.

In 2015, and again in August 2020, the Talbot County Council voted against removing the Talbot Boys statue, but in September 2021, the council voted to remove the statue. On March 14, 2022, the statue was removed.

In 2018, Easton was named one of America&#x27;s top 5 coolest places to buy a vacation home by Forbes.

<text>Oxford is a waterfront town and former colonial port in Talbot County, Maryland, United States. The population was 651 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Oxford is one of the oldest towns in Maryland. While Oxford officially marks the year 1683 as its founding because in that year it was first named by the Maryland General Assembly as a seaport, the town began between 1666 and 1668 when were laid out as a town called Oxford by William Stephens Jr.. By 1669 one of the first houses was built for Innkeeper Francis Armstrong (see Talbot County Land Records, A 1, f. 10/11).

Oxford first appears on a map completed in 1670 and published in 1671. In 1694, Oxford and a new town called Anne Arundel (now Annapolis) were selected as the only ports of entry for the entire Maryland province. Until the American Revolution, Oxford enjoyed prominence as an international shipping center surrounded by wealthy tobacco plantations.

Early inhabitants included Robert Morris Sr., agent for a Liverpool shipping firm who greatly influenced the town&#x27;s growth; his son, Robert Morris Jr., known as &quot;the financier of the Revolution;&quot; Jeremiah Banning, sea captain, war hero, and statesman; The Reverend Thomas Bacon, Anglican clergyman who wrote the first compilation of the laws of Maryland; Matthew Tilghman, known as the &quot;patriarch of Maryland&quot; and &quot;father of statehood&quot;; and Colonel Tench Tilghman, aide-de-camp to George Washington and the man who carried the message of General Cornwallis&#x27;s surrender to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia.

Tench Tilghman&#x27;s grave can be found at the Oxford cemetery. It is overshadowed by the Tench Tilghman Monument, a stone spire approximately 10 feet tall. The monument is the tallest monument found at the Oxford cemetery. The cemetery itself was used in the opening sequence of the 1988 feature film, Clara&#x27;s Heart, starring Whoopi Goldberg and Neil Patrick Harris.

The American Revolution marked the end of Oxford&#x27;s prosperity. Maritime trade declined, and tobacco was replaced by wheat as a cash crop.

After the Civil War, Oxford was revived by the completion of the railroad in 1871 and by improved methods of canning and packing which opened national markets for oysters from the Chesapeake Bay. This did not last. In the early part of the 20th century, the oyster beds played out, the packing houses closed, other businesses went bankrupt, and the railway and steamships eventually disappeared. Oxford became a sleepy little town inhabited mainly by watermen who still worked the waters of the Tred Avon River.

Oxford is host to the oldest privately operated ferry service still in continuous use in the United States. The original ferry service, known today as the Oxford–Bellevue Ferry, was established in 1683 and continues today. The ferry links Oxford with Bellevue, Maryland, crossing the 3/4 mile width of the Tred Avon River during a 7-10 minute trip (20 minute round trip).

Oxford today is still a waterman&#x27;s town, but is enjoying a new resurgence based on tourism and leisure activities. The film Failure to Launch was filmed in part here.

The town is served by the Oxford Volunteer Fire Company, composed of two engines, a truck, tanker, command unit, brush unit, two BLS units, and a boat. They often respond to all of Talbot County as part of the Mutual Aid system. On average, they respond to over 100 calls per year.

Barnaby House, &quot;Billie P. Hall&quot;, Jena, Otwell, Oxford Historic District, and &quot;S. C. Dobson&quot; are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="116593" wikidata="Q753688" url="?curid=116593" title="Saint Michaels, Maryland">
<text>Saint Michaels, also known as St. Michaels, is a town in Talbot County, Maryland, United States. The population was 1,094 at the 2023 World Population Review. Growing at a rate of 1.3% annually, its population hit a peak with the 2020 Census reporting a 3.99% increase. Saint Michaels derives its name from the Episcopal parish — itself named after Michael the Archangel — established there in 1677. The church attracted settlers who engaged in tobacco growing and ship-building, and thence further development.

==History==

The town was laid out as a speculative development in the 1770s by James Braddock. Unlike the more typical 18th century grid-pattern town planning, Braddock laid St. Michaels out around a central square. The town was incorporated in 1804.

A rural Anglican church that long predated the town gave St. Michaels its name. Despite this church&#x27;s presence on the shore of the harbor, the town of St. Michaels early became predominantly Methodist following visits by itinerant Methodist preachers. Braddock donated land for a Methodist church in the center of St. Mary&#x27;s square. A brick structure was built and after the war of 1812 the name of Sardis Chapel was adopted. That building was razed and a new brick building was erected in 1839. The cornerstone was laid on July 4, 1839. It remains on that site.

The town&#x27;s earliest industry was shipbuilding, and as many as six shipbuilders were active in or near the town by the War of 1812. Their typical product was a fast schooner, a type later known as the Baltimore Clipper. Such vessels were well adapted to evading blockades or outrunning pirates or foreign naval vessels at sea, and some were later used as private armed vessels carrying a letter of marque. For example, Thomas L. Haddaway launched the schooner Lottery at St. Michaels in 1812, and its owners obtained a letter of marque allowing it to take prizes at sea.

The town played a role in the War of 1812 when, in 1813, a fleet under the command of Admiral George Cockburn moved up the Chesapeake Bay, and targeted St. Michaels because of the presence of a militia battery erected to defend the town and its shipyards. Under cover of early morning darkness on August 10, 1813, the Battle of St. Michaels commenced as the British sent a landing party ashore just south of the town, and after a brief exchange, neutralized the battery and returned to their boats. The British proceeded to bombard the town from the barges and a brig, but failed to destroy the shipyards or cause any substantial damage to the town. The militia returned fire from artillery batteries at Impy Dawson&#x27;s wharf (the foot of Mulberry Street) and Mill Point (the foot of Carpenter Street). A contemporary report noted that &quot;several houses were pierced&quot; by the British fire. Nearly a century later, a story was recorded that as a result of the town&#x27;s ruse of dimming the lights and hanging lanterns in the trees beyond the town so that the cannonballs would overshoot the town, the town was spared. Based on this story, St. Michaels became known as &quot;the town that fooled the British,&quot; a nickname selected during the sesquicentennial celebration of the battle in 1963. The Cannonball House survives as one of the structures reportedly struck by one of the shots, and is on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the Saint Michaels Historic District.

Shipbuilding declined after the War of 1812, but an oyster industry revived the town a few decades later. By the late nineteenth century, most households in the town had at least one person engaged in some aspect of this fishery, either tonging oysters from the nearby waters of Miles River and Eastern Bay, or engaged in the shucking houses that came to line the waterfront. One of these businesses, Coulbourne and Jewett, founded in the early years of the twentieth century, is notable as a black-owned enterprise, and it early on came to specialize in crabmeat. As a means of marketing crabmeat, owner Frederick Jewett devised a five level grading system (regular, claw, special, backfin, and lump) which is still used by the industry today.

St Michaels is where Frederick Douglass was sold in 1832 to Thomas Auld, and it was in the St Michaels jail that Douglass was confined in 1835 after an attempted escape to freedom.

In addition to the Cannonball House and St. Michaels Historic District, Crooked Intention, Edmee S., Edna E. Lockwood, Island Bird (log canoe), Island Blossom (log canoe), Island Lark (log canoe), Jay Dee (log canoe), Magic (log canoe), Noddy (log canoe), The Old Inn, Persistence (log canoe), Rover (log canoe), Saint Michaels Mill, Sherwood Manor, Stanley Norman (skipjack), and Victorian Corn Cribs are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The impetus started with a maritime museum, which opened its doors in 1965, and a waterfront seafood restaurant and a tour boat (the Patriot) followed before the end of the decade.

==Notable people==
* Frederick Douglass was owned as slave in and around St. Michaels on several occasions during his childhood and teenage years in the early 19th century. He lived within the St. Michaels village limits on several occasions as well as Wye House, a prominent plantation situated across the Miles River from St. Michaels. Researchers have also identified two plantations (though cannot definitively say which one) where Douglass likely worked for Edward Covey, a notorious &quot;slave breaker,&quot; in what is now McDaniels, an unincorporated community near St. Michaels. In 1877, Frederick Douglass, then the U.S. Marshall for the District of Columbia, returned to St. Michaels, mainly to meet with his former owner, Thomas Auld, who was on his deathbed. According to Douglass, the meeting, which took place at what is now known as the Dr. Dodson/Bruff house, resulted in a reconciliation between the two men. 
* Former baseball player, and member of baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame, Harold Baines grew up and still lives in Saint Michaels.

* The television show &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot; In season 6 episode 2, The Land Ship, references a scenario in which, during the War of 1812, the townspeople where the Belcher Family lives pulled a boat onto shore and rocked it back and forth in order to trick the British into running their ships aground thinking the shoreline was further inland. This is referred to in the show as &#x27;The Sloop that Duped the British&#x27;. This was confirmed as a reference to St. Michaels by co-writer and Voice of Bob Belcher, H. Jon Benjamin.

<text>Tilghman Island is an island in the Chesapeake Bay. It is part of Talbot County, Maryland, United States.

== History ==
Initially known as Great Choptank Island, the island became identified with a series of local families. It was owned by Matthew Tilghman&#x27;s family from 1752 and has been known as Tilghman Island ever since. During the War of 1812 the island was briefly occupied by the British, who obtained provisions for their military forces. The community of Tilghman appeared in the 1840s. The economy shifted from farming to greater reliance on oystering and fishing as markets developed in Baltimore and Washington, aided by steamboat service in the 1890s.

<text>Boonsboro is a town in Washington County, Maryland, United States, located at the foot of South Mountain. It nearly borders Frederick County and is proximate to the Antietam National Battlefield. The population was 3,779 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Local lore asserts Boonsboro was founded by George Boone, a cousin of Daniel Boone, and was originally named &quot;Margaretsville&quot; after his wife. The town was incorporated as Boonesborough in 1831. Local newspapers and villagers preferred the name Boonsboro. The former name was used on some documents as late as 1903.
Boonsboro was a key town during the American Civil War. Two battles were fought in its present borders. The town was also used to keep wounded soldiers after the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. Southeast of the town was the site of the Battle of South Mountain.

Boonsboro lies on what used to be the National Road. Today it is known as either the Old National Pike or Alt-U.S. 40. In Boonsboro it is Main Street. The route was originally established as a road improvement project in 1758 to shorten travel between Fredericktown and Fort Frederick during the Seven Years&#x27; War. The route began from the existing (old) road at today&#x27;s Marker road, passed through Turner&#x27;s Gap, Boonsboro and turned west along today&#x27;s MD. Rt. 68 to Williamsport. The route from Boonsboro to Funkstown was later adopted as part of the National Turnpike route.

The town suffered a fire at the former Asaro&#x27;s (its successor Vesta moved to the building across) in 2007, and a fire at the former inn in 2008. That fire completely gutted the inn, which was on the verge of being renovated and reopened. The Inn BoonsBoro finally opened a year later; it is owned by best-selling romance novelist Nora Roberts.

The Boonsboro Historic District, Bowman House, Ingram-Schipper Farm, Keedy House, St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church, and Washington Monument are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="116600" wikidata="Q753597" url="?curid=116600" title="Fort Ritchie, Maryland">
<text>Fort Ritchie is a census-designated place (CDP) in Washington County, Maryland, United States, just south of the Pennsylvania state line. The population was 276 at the 2000 census. Fort Ritchie is a former U.S. military base that closed in September 1998, pursuant to the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania is immediately to the north.

==History==
Fort Ritchie was originally established as a training site for the Maryland National Guard. It was acquired as a US Army installation during World War II. During the war it was used as a training site for interrogators and psychological warfare experts, known as the Ritchie Boys. After the war, it was used as a communications center by the Army supporting the Military District of Washington and by the Air Force in support of the nearby Raven Rock Mountain Complex Alternate National Military Command Center (ANMCC). The post was closed in September 1998.

Since then there has been no comprehensive redevelopment plan for the facility. The last residents of former military housing on the site were evicted in June 2017. As of April 2021, the Washington County Board of Commissioners negotiated a sale to private investor John Krumpotich. As of July, 2021, Krumpotich is actively working on the rehabilitation of the existing buildings on the former post, and have found great success in restoring former military housing.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (3.00%) is water.

The geography of Ritchie, and more broadly Cascade, Maryland played an extensive role in the settlement of the area. The elevation of nearly 1,400 ft in a &quot;high valley&quot; surrounded by elevations surpassing 2,000 ft at Fort Ritchie allowed for the Buena Vista Ice Company to successfully create and sell naturally cut ice to larger cities such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C. in the late 1800s until 1903. Buena Vista was the southernmost ice company in the United States. It was the original infrastructure of Buena Vista which ultimately influenced the Maryland National Guard to approve the site for its use.

Many bordering communities, such as Smithsburg, MD and Waynesboro, PA only boast elevations between 700–800 ft in juxtaposition of Quirauk Mountain where its highest elevation caps a 2,145 ft and is the highest point of South Mountain. As a result of this elevation, Cascade Elementary students have their own inclement weather zone which allows for either a delay, early dismissal, or day off of school depending upon the severity of winter weather whereas other Washington County Public School students may not have delays or cancellations. It is not uncommon for the Cascade area and Fort Ritchie to receive twice as much snow as other nearby communities. It is also notorious for ice storms which make travel exceedingly dangerous during winter storms.

<text>Funkstown is a town in Washington County, Maryland, United States. The population was 904 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Originally were sold to Henry Funk by Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore in 1754 and settled as &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.

The Civil War Battle of Funkstown took place July 10, 1863, during the Gettysburg Campaign as Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia retreated toward Virginia in the week following the Battle of Gettysburg.
Union forces of the Army of the Potomac attacked the rear guard of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia during its retreat from Pennsylvania following the Battle of Gettysburg.

A strong Confederate presence at Funkstown threatened any Union advance against Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s position near Williamsport and the Potomac River as he retreated to Virginia after the Battle of Gettysburg. Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s cavalry, posted at Funkstown, posed a serious risk to the Federal right and rear if the Union army lunged west from Boonsboro. Stuart, meanwhile, determined to wage a spirited defense to ensure Lee time to complete fortifications protecting his army and his avenue of retreat.

As Brig. Gen. John Buford&#x27;s Federal cavalry division cautiously approached Funkstown via the National Road on Friday morning July 10, 1863, it encountered Stuart&#x27;s crescent-shaped, three-mile-long battle line. It was Stuart&#x27;s first defensive battle since reentering Maryland. The high ground constituted Stuart&#x27;s extreme right, held by Preston Chew&#x27;s horse artillery. A nearby stone barn and barnyard wall proved a superb defensive position for the 34th Virginia Battalion&#x27;s dismounted cavalry.
Col. Thomas C. Devin&#x27;s dismounted Union cavalry brigade attacked about 8:00 a.m. By mid-afternoon, with Buford&#x27;s cavalrymen running low on ammunition and gaining little ground, Col. Lewis A. Grant&#x27;s First Vermont Brigade of infantry arrived and jabbed at the Confederate center less than one mile away. Unbeknownst to the Vermonters, Gen. George T. Anderson&#x27;s Confederate brigade now faced them, the first time opposing infantry had clashed since the Battle of Gettysburg.

By early evening, the Union Army began withdrawing south towards Beaver Creek. Stuart had kept the Federals at bay for yet another day. The day-long battle east of the road resulted in 479 casualties. The Chaney house served as a hospital. At the Keller home, Confederate Major Henry D. McDaniel, later the governor of Georgia, survived his wounds.
The house at 16 W. Cemetery St. remained a church until it burned down a second time, finally being rebuilt into the existing house in 1913.

The Funkstown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

As of 2017 the town park is listed as 77.04 acres and the town area, less the park, is 208.77 acres for a grand total of 285.81 acres.

<doc id="116608" wikidata="Q754521" url="?curid=116608" title="Keedysville, Maryland">
<text>Keedysville is a town in Washington County, Maryland, United States. The population was 1,152 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The first documented house in Keedysville was built in 1738. The description for George Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Gordon&#x27;s Purchase&quot; land tract notes &quot;...one log house, 12 x 15 feet...&quot; The initial warrant for the tract had been issued to Owen McDonald in Jan. 1738, the year before Gordon acquired it. Gordon&#x27;s Purchase was the first tract taken up by a Euromerican within what would eventually become Keedysville. The main road at that time was the Conococheague Road, which branched from the Great Wagon Road just east of Keedysville and led to the farthest reaches of the provence, passing through what would eventually be Keedysville. The house and its exact location are unknown but the starting point for Gordon&#x27;s Purchase was on today&#x27;s Bell Lane. 

As more settlers moved into the region a grist mill was built on Little Antietam Creek about 1765 to serve the earliest farmers who were mostly German and Swiss immigrants who&#x27;d migrated from Pennsylvania. This mill was bought by Jacob Hess in 1770. Hess owned the mill and most of what would become the town until his death in 1815. During this period the budding community became known as &quot;Hess&#x27;s Mill.&quot; In the years immediately following Jacob Hess&#x27;s death the Sharpsburg to Boonsboro Turnpike was constructed (about 1820), which became Keedysville&#x27;s main street. 

Due to its location exactly half-way between Boonsboro and Sharpsburg the town became known as Centerville. The town&#x27;s name officially became Keedysville when the first post office was established due to the existence of another Centerville, Maryland in Queen Anne&#x27;s County. In the mid-1860s the B&amp;O Railroad began acquiring a right-of-way and by the early 1870s a branch line extended from Weverton to Hagerstown with a busy Keedysville depot as the mid-way point. The railroad brought a much needed prosperity following the dark days of the civil war. 

In 1872 Keedysville was officially chartered as a municipality. Keedysville was home to numerous businesses through the first half of the 1900s but the commercial nature of the town had begun to decline by the century&#x27;s second decade. Like most small towns, the advent of the automobile and mechanization brought a gradual change as larger stores and factories became easily accessible and previously plentiful manual labor jobs decreased. Keedysville remained almost unchanged otherwise for much of the 20th century. Several additions to the town were planned by the turn of the century and the population which had previously hovered around 400 for many years, suddenly swelled to more than double that number in a single decade.

An alternate history credits Jacob Hess as the first settler, who then builds a mill forming the nucleus for the town. As shown above, settlement began in the 1730s. Jacob Hess did not arrive in the area until approximately 1760 with the Christian Orndorff family. He is noted at that time as &quot;&quot;a German youth&quot;.&quot; This narrative, claiming construction of the mill complex in 1768 may stem from Hess&#x27; first land tract &quot;Hess&#x27; Discovery,&quot; patented that year. The mill, however, was on the tract Gordon&#x27;s Purchase, not Hess&#x27; Discovery. Hess was, however, a prosperous businessman and community leader. As such, he remains integral to the establishment of the town.

Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Bridge, Antietam Creek, Baker Farm, Doub Farm, Geeting Farm, Hills, Dales and The Vinyard, Hitt&#x27;s Mill and Houses, Hoffman Farm, Keedysville Historic District, and Nicodemus Mill Complex are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Keedysville is underlain by the Tomstown Dolomite, a carbonic rock formation of the Cambrian. The Tomstown is known for producing most of the caves in Washington County, especially in the area surrounding Keedysville. The area was once home to eight different caves, several of which were discovered during quarrying operations to remove rock for highway construction. The most famous of these caves, Crystal Grottoes, was discovered in 1920 and is now the only show-cave in Maryland.

The high concentration of caves in this area may be related to increased drainage of groundwater. The water table in this locality is drained by the Little Antietam Creek and its tributaries, and many of these caves can be found in the cliffs and along the broken plateau east of town.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Keedysville has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Transportation==

The primary means of travel to and from Keedysville is by road. The only significant highway serving the town is Maryland Route 34, which connects eastward to Boonsboro and westward to Sharpsburg. One additional state highway, Maryland Route 845, also traverses the town, following the old route of MD 34 along Main Street.

<text>Paramount-Long Meadow is a census-designated place (CDP) in Washington County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,722 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

== History ==
The region of Washington County Maryland known today as Long Meadow was originally a large mostly level area covering close to twenty square-miles of agriculturally desirable land west of Antietam Creek. One of the earliest transportation routes through the colony passed near this region, crossing the upper branches of Antietam Creek before turning southwest. This was a route preferred by many of the early German and Swiss immigrant settlers to the Hagerstown area from central Pennsylvania. The name Long Meadow derives from a land grant issued to Thomas Cresap (Sr.) in 1739. Cresap&#x27;s Long Meadow property would be transferred to investor Daniel Dulaney of Annapolis in 1746 and enlarged from 550 acres to 2131 acres. &quot;Long Meadow&quot; and the region surrounding it would remain mostly agricultural until the mid-20th century. In 1958 the name was revived with the opening of the region&#x27;s first purpose-built shopping area, &quot;Long Meadow Shopping Center&quot; between Northern Avenue and Potomac Avenue / Leitersburg Pike.

<text>Rohrersville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Washington County, Maryland, United States. The population was 175 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The first settlers to arrive in the vicinity of Rohrersville began to survey land tracts in the 1730s. &quot;Park Hall,&quot; a tract of 1,550 acres, encompassing the present village of Rohrersville, was patented in 1732 by William Parks, and resurveyed in 1766 to Andrew Grimm.

In 1747, Frederick Rohrer, a Mennonite from Germany, arrived in Philadelphia with his two oldest sons Samuel and Martin and the rest of his family. Frederick purchased property just east of Hagerstown from his brother Jacob, who had emigrated some years earlier. Their property was where Trovinger&#x27;s Mill is now located. In 1763, Frederick&#x27;s son Samuel bought three large tracts of land just north of Rohrersville at the same time John Rohrer of Lampeter, PA (perhaps a cousin?) bought the adjacent property, known as Piney Hills or Pennyhill. These properties are roughly bounded by Rohrersville Road (Rt. 67), Marble Quarry Road, Millbrook Road and Elk Ridge.

By the mid 1790s, most of Samuel&#x27;s children had left the area, but two of his sons, John and Frederick, remained, as did Capt. John M. Rohrer, grandson of the John Rohrer who had purchased Piney Hills. Samuel&#x27;s son Frederick ended up owning most of his father&#x27;s original property plus Piney Hills, and he named the combined properties Pleasant Valley. Frederick in turn had several sons, two of whom, Daniel and Samuel, are credited with starting a grist mill in the early 1800s that led to the formation of the village of Rohrersville. The name Rohrersville first appears in 1836.

By the 1860s, Rohrersville had grown into a bustling commercial center for the surrounding farms of Pleasant Valley. A map of 1859 shows the growing number of businesses and residences in the town. In addition to the grist mill, the town also had a thriving marble industry, and a quarry was situated nearby to serve the business of William McCoy, who founded the town&#x27;s most widely known institution, the Rohrersville Cornet Band, in 1837. By 1867, Rohrersville was served by the Washington County Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The rail line was started at Weverton, located at the southern end of Pleasant Valley, shortly after the Civil War, and ran through Pleasant Valley northwest to Hagerstown, where it connected to the other rail lines that converged there. The arrival of the railroad heralded a second era of prosperity for Rohrersville and many of the buildings in the village, displaying a variety of Victorian architectural styles, date to this period.
The first church in Rohrersville, a log structure open to the use of several congregations, was built in 1842 on the site of the present town cemetery. The cornerstone for the present Bethel United Methodist Church (Formerly Bethel United Brethren Church) was laid on July 24, 1871. This is the oldest house of worship standing in Rohrersville today. The former St. Mark&#x27;s Lutheran Church, a brick structure built in Gothic Revival Style, was built in 1879. A second United Brethren Church was erected in the village in 1888, just down the street from Bethel Church. This congregation ceased operation in 2009 and the building has since been used by the Church of the Savior congregation. The village also had an Elementary School that operated in at least four different buildings before closing in 1978. This building is today used by the Rohrersville Ruritan Club, a community service organization, which was formed in 1952.

Kefauver Place was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

<text>Sharpsburg is a town in Washington County, Maryland. The town is approximately south of Hagerstown. Its population was 560 at the 2020 census.

During the American Civil War, the Battle of Antietam, referred to as the Battle of Sharpsburg by the South, was fought on what is now Antietam National Battlefield, in the vicinity of Antietam Creek.

==History==

The first American of European descent to own land in what would eventually become Sharpsburg was the one-time indian trader Edmund Cartledge. By the time Cartledge surveyed his &quot;Hickory Tavern&quot; land tract in 1737, the Great Philadelphia Wagon Road was already well established over the path that would become Sharpsburg&#x27;s main street. Hickory Tavern is noted in the patent as between the wagon road and Garrison Spring, today&#x27;s Big Spring. Thousands of immigrants used this route of the wagon road traveling from Pennsylvania as far south as the Carolinas.

On May 1, 1755, the road was used by Major general Edward Braddock, colonial governor Horatio Sharpe and several of Braddock&#x27;s staff officers to reach Winchester, Virginia, while his 48th regiment took a longer route via today&#x27;s Williamsport, Maryland. Among the officers accompanying Braddock that day was a young Virginia militia officer named George Washington.

At the end of the French and Indian War in 1763, Joseph Chapline founded a town, naming it in honor of his friend Horatio Sharpe, the Proprietary Governor of the Province of Maryland. Its original settlers were mostly of German or Swiss origin reaching the area from Pennsylvania via the great wagon road. They were a major force in leading to an increase in wheat production from the original agricultural dependence on tobacco.

Located east of the Potomac River, Sharpsburg attracted industry in the early 19th century, especially after the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was extended to Sharpsburg in 1836. The town was incorporated in 1832.

Sharpsburg gained national recognition during the American Civil War, when Confederate General Robert E. Lee invaded Maryland with his Army of Northern Virginia in the summer of 1862 and was intercepted near the town by Union General George B. McClellan with the Army of the Potomac. The rival armies met on September 17, in the Battle of Antietam (also called the Battle of Sharpsburg). It would be the bloodiest single day in all American military annals, with a total of nearly 23,000 casualties to both sides. A few days earlier, the multi-sited Battle of South Mountain occurred at the three low-lying passes in South Mountain—Crampton&#x27;s Gap, Turner&#x27;s Gap, and Fox&#x27;s Gap—where Lee&#x27;s forces attempted to hold back the advancing Union regiments moving westward especially along the important National Road (now U.S. Route 40 Alternate) which is now a part of South Mountain State Battlefield Park.

The drawn battle is considered a turning point of the war, since it kept the Confederacy from winning a needed victory on Northern soil, which might have gained it European recognition. Lee&#x27;s retreat gave Abraham Lincoln the opportunity he needed to issue his Emancipation Proclamation, declaring all slaves residing in rebelling Confederate territory against the federal government, to be &quot;forever free&quot;. This act made it even more unlikely that Europe would grant diplomatic recognition to the South.

Sharpsburg claims its Memorial Day commemoration as one of the first in the U.S., having their 147th consecutive celebration in 2014.

<text>Smithsburg is a town in Washington County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,975 at the 2010 census. Smithsburg is close to the former Fort Ritchie army base and just west of the presidential retreat Camp David.

==History==

Smithsburg, MD was founded in 1812 by Christopher &quot;Stuffle&quot; Smith. He purchased a plot of land formerly known as &quot;part of Shadrack&#x27;s Lot.&quot; The community&#x27;s development was directly influenced by factors such as migration paths, the arrival of the railroad, and advances in agricultural technology. By 1923, much of the existing village had been erected. Smithsburg was incorporated in 1846.

Smithsburg acted as a hospital town during the American Civil War in 1862, treating wounded soldiers from nearby battles at South Mountain and Antietam. On July 5, 1863, Confederate General James Stuart and Union General Kilpatrick exchanged artillery fire over Smithsburg. A cannon ball from this exchange can be found lodged in the wall of a building on Water Street. Kilpatrick continued the advance to Boonsboro, Maryland after the engagement on July 6.

An incident involving slaves in May 1845 proved to be violent for the people of Smithsburg. Twelve runaway slaves from Leesburg, Virginia had been seeking their way to freedom in the North when a man who considered himself to be a professional slave catcher, who had only supposed the group to be runaways, noticed the party making their way past his home at three o’clock in the morning. Beckoning the town constable and six other men to apprehend the runaways, the supposed leader exclaimed, “Now, boys, G-d d--n you, fight!” Armed with pistols and tomahawks, the Virginia runaways had the upper hand as the rural Smithsburg men only exhibited clubs and sticks for protection. A skirmish took place which badly wounded some of the Smithsburg men: “Constable Flora was twice knocked down, Price had his arm nearly severed and the bone broken, by a blow from a tomahawk he also had a pistol snapped in his face, which unfortunately failed to go off…Shank was several times felled to the earth, and the whole party more or less injured.” Despite their efforts, only four slaves were captured - two by the Smithsburg troop and two more in an adjoining town, Leitersburg - yet the bulk of the runaways presumably were successful in their audacious escape into Pennsylvania.

During the Gettysburg Campaign, on the afternoon of July 5, 1863, Federal cavalry defended Smithsburg from an attack led by General J.E.B. Stuart and Confederate cavalry during their retreat from the Battle of Gettysburg.

President Lyndon Johnson, his wife Lady Bird Johnson, and their daughter Lynda Bird Johnson, visited St. Ann&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Smithsburg on Easter Sunday, March 26, 1967. During his term, Johnson visited Smithsburg many times due to its close proximity to Camp David. In 1963, President and First Lady Johnson were on their way from Camp David to a Church in Hagerstown, Maryland. Along their route was a junkyard known as &quot;Elwoods Auto Exchange&quot; which the first lady felt &quot;ruined the beautiful landscape&quot;. She requested the driver pull the limousine onto the shoulder of the road. She then marched up the dirt road to the main office and proceeded to give Elwoods Grimm &quot;a piece of her mind regarding the unsightliness of the wrecking yard.&quot; Two years following this occurrence the Highway Beautification Act was passed by Congress. The Auto Exchange is still in operation and is now hidden by a line of pine trees which blocks its view from the main highway. While there is no documentation of Lady Bird&#x27;s rant, several documents are available through the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum which show her acknowledgements of the unsightliness of the Auto Exchange.

On June 9, 2022, three people were killed and a fourth was wounded in a mass shooting that occurred at Columbia Machine, Inc., previously known as Bikle Manufacturing. Shortly after, a state trooper was wounded as well by a suspect during an exchange of gunfire. The suspect was then arrested and subsequently charged, and he was later indicted for murder, attempted murder and using a firearm during a violent crime in July 2022.

==History==

The town lies on one of the early Native American trails between New York and the Carolinas. In the mid-18th century, tens of thousands of European settlers and pioneer families with their wagons followed the same route on the Great Wagon Road from Pennsylvania to Virginia and points south and west. In 1744, a ferry was established at the present site of Williamsport to carry the traffic across the Potomac River. Today’s travelers make the crossing on Interstate 81 a mile downriver from the town.

In 1755 the land tract of Thomas Cresap (Jr.) named &quot;Leeds&quot; at the future site of Williamsport would become an important supply depot for the Braddock expedition to capture the French fort Duquesne (at present Pittsburgh). Supplies were transported to this place both west from Rock Creek (today&#x27;s Georgetown) and south from Pennsylvania. Col. Thomas Dunbar&#x27;s 48th regiment of the British Army encamped here on May 1, 1755, before ferrying across the Potomac River and marching two days south to rejoin Sir Thomas Halkett&#x27;s 44th regiment north of Winchester, Virginia. Just over two months later Dunbar, the highest-ranking surviving, unwounded officer, would lead the remains of the tattered army through Williamsport to Frederick, Maryland on the retreat to Philadelphia.

The land of present-day Williamsport was previously owned by Otho Holland Williams, a Continental Army officer in the American Revolutionary War, and for whom the town is named.

Cedar Grove, Daniel Donnelly House, Elmwood, Rose Hill, Sprechers Mill House, Springfield Farm, Tammany, and the Williamsport Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Economic growth===

In 1834, boats using a portion of the newly built Chesapeake and Ohio Canal were able to reach Williamsport from Washington, D.C. The canal itself was extended to Williamsport in 1835. The canal became an important commercial route which connected the area with the lower Potomac River region and the Chesapeake Bay, and later with the Cumberland, Maryland region as the canal construction continued westward. Williamsport became a very popular waterfront town which benefited the economy. In 1873, the Western Maryland Railway extended its line from Hagerstown to Williamsport, in order to gain access to canal traffic. Coal from Cumberland area mines was one of the principal commodities transferred from canal barges to rail cars at Williamsport.

===Flooding===
In 1863, during the Civil War, the overflowing flooding waters of the river prevented General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army, on its retreat from Gettysburg, from crossing and making it safely into Virginia for several days. A large flood in 1924 caused extensive damage to the canal, which was then permanently shut down.

==Recent developments==
The town&#x27;s historic core was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Williamsport Historic District in 2001.

The town in May 2010 secured Michael Sparks, a previous town consultant and writer of a revitalization feasibility study, as Director of Economic and Community Development to revitalize downtown and attract tourism. Mr. Sparks outlined a revitalization initiative with the acronym of C.A.R.E. 
* C-Connecting the various assets of the Town both physically and aesthetically. 
* A-Align and inform the merchants with the needs and demographics of tourists. 
* R-Rebuild through improving building conditions with Code Enforcement and Ordinance changes. 
* E-Entertainment and how to create excitement to pull tourist activity into the town so that it can be built upon and capitalized on by a revitalized Town Center.

Over a one-year experiment with having a full-time economic development employee hundreds of thousands of grant dollars were secured for projects including handicap accessibility for town buildings, reconstruction of sewage pump stations, a possible bike-and-boat rental facility, and the town was approved as a Heart of the Civil War Heritage Area Target Investment Zone. Bike lanes, bike racks and directional signage were installed to better direct tourists and connect the town with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. A new permit process was set up with the Washington County, Maryland permit office, building code enforcement and heavy truck traffic were addressed. Events were coordinated that emphasized revitalization and the downtown merchants. Additionally local youth were honored for community involvement, events were coordinated for town youth and a Boys and Girls Club was created. The changes increased business in Williamsport. The town is part of a regional initiative known as the Canal Towns Partnership.

FirstEnergy corporation closed the R. Paul Smith Power Station in Williamsport on September 1, 2012.
==Transportation==
The main means of transportation to and from Williamsport are by road. Interstate 81 is the main highway directly serving Williamsport, passing along the town&#x27;s southeastern border. I-81 continues north towards Harrisburg and south towards Martinsburg. A few miles from Williamsport, I-81 also has an interchange with Interstate 70, which provides access to Baltimore and Pittsburgh. Other highways serving Williamsport include U.S. Route 11, Maryland Route 63 and Maryland Route 68, all of which converge in the center of town.

<text>Delmar is a town in Wicomico County, Maryland, United States. The population was 3,003 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. When the population is added to Delmar, Delaware, the town&#x27;s total population is 4,600.

== History ==

The Town of Delmar was founded in October 1859 with the extension of the Delaware Railroad to the southern boundary of Delaware. The Transpeninsular Line was responsible for the founding of this unique bi-state town because the Charter of the Delaware Railroad Company permitted only the building of a railroad within the State of Delaware and the charter of the corresponding railroad company in Maryland permitted only the laying of railroad track within the State of Maryland. Thus, in 1859, the two respective railroads met and the Town of Delmar was born. The name of Delmar was derived for this railroad center from the states whose line it straddles – DELaware and MARyland.

The Town of Delmar grew slowly until 1884 when the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad Co. completed a railroad from Pocomoke City, Maryland to Cape Charles, Virginia and also established a ferry service across the Chesapeake Bay between Cape Charles and Norfolk, Virginia. These new developments immediately made the Delmarva Peninsula an important link between the north and south. The Town of Delmar, being the midway town of the Delmarva Peninsula and already a railroad terminal, was the point for trains to change crews and locomotives and also a center for maintenance of the rolling equipment. As a result of these developments, a tremendous influx of experienced railroad men into the community and considerable extra employment was furnished for local townspeople. During this accelerated rapid growth period, Delmar became a &quot;boom town&quot;. New dwelling units sprang up all over town and new businesses were established to meet the demands of its growing population. By 1889, the population of the Town of Delmar had increased to 680 and was still growing.

In 1888, the Town of Delmar, Maryland was granted a charter by the General Assembly of Maryland. An examination of this charter and the laws of Maryland fails to reveal any mention of the twin town of Delmar, Delaware. Therefore, it could be assumed that up until this time there was very little cooperation between halves of the Town of Delmar. The Town of Delmar was almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1892 and again in 1901. The first fire destroyed everything in its path over a ten-acre (40,000 m2) area and the second major fire was almost as destructive. In each instance, the Town of Delmar was rebuilt and continued as a flourishing town. The first indication of any cooperation between Delmar, Maryland and Delmar, Delaware came in 1924 when surveys were conducted for a possible sewerage system for the entire Town of Delmar. The construction of the sewerage system in 1927 was considered the first joint project between the two towns in that the law provided that both towns would maintain the outfall sewer with Maryland paying the expenses and billing the Delaware side one-half of all costs.

The biggest push towards abolishing the jurisdictional, legal effects of the State line came when the Lions Club voted to sponsor a project for the consolidation of the two school systems in the town. Since the town was founded, each side had its own individual school with the one in Delaware operating under the local School Board and the Maryland School operating under the Wicomico County Board of Education. This very controversial issue was bitterly contested for over three years and finally in 1949, this dream became a reality when the junior and senior high schools were consolidated into one school using the Delaware facilities. Four years later the fourth, fifth and sixth grades were also consolidated with classes in the Maryland school. This controversial decision represented one of the greatest steps forward educationally for the town of Delmar and also towards eliminating the jurisdictional barrier between the two parts of town.

Hebron Train Depot
In 1890, the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad was extended westward from Salisbury. About six miles from that city, the line crossed a country road where there was a store and a Colonial dwelling. All around were farms and woodland. Here the builders of the railroad designated a shipping point and named it Hebron (The community was named for the biblical city). Five years later, a lumber manufacturing plant was located there, and a hamlet began to develop. 
While earlier towns sprang up on rivers, Hebron came about because of the railroad and to the immense effect that the railroad had on this area was added the automobile and improved farm machinery. By the 1920s Hebron was a hub for farming as well as manufacturing with major markets being easily and quickly accessible. In 1927 there were five shirt factories, a flour mill, a canning operation, a lumber mill, and a new high school under construction. There were large poultry and dairy farms joining the profitable farming of peaches, apples, strawberries, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, cantaloupes, and watermelons. The most prominent of these were the farms of B. Frank Adkins known as Neighbor&#x27;s Wonder Farm, renowned for its herd of Guernsey cattle, the Oakdale Poultry Farm owned by J.T. Insley, and the farms of James A. Phillips and James Gordy. Notable citizens responsible for the manufacturing aspect of the town were Walter B. Miller and G.A. Bounds, the latter which owned both a lumber mill and canning plant and whose house still stands on Main Street today.

<text>Salisbury ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Wicomico County, Maryland, United States. Salisbury is the largest city in the state&#x27;s Eastern Shore region, with a population of 33,050 at the 2020 census. Salisbury is the principal city of the Salisbury, Maryland Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city is a commercial hub of the Delmarva Peninsula.

==History==
Salisbury&#x27;s location at the head of Wicomico River was a major factor in growth. At first, it was a small colonial outpost set up by Lord Baltimore. Salisbury was established in 1732.

Salisbury&#x27;s location at the head of the Wicomico River was seen to be a convenient location for trading purposes. Due to the similar physical attributes as well as the nationality of Salisbury&#x27;s founders, many historians believe that the name was inspired by the city of Salisbury, England, an ancient cathedral city.

Salisbury was officially incorporated as a city in 1854.

Salisbury also had a role in the American Civil War, as it served as a location where Union forces encamped in order to search for sympathizers from the South. These Union forces also worked to inhibit the movement of contraband to Confederate forces in the South.

Fires struck Salisbury in both 1860 and 1886, burning through two-thirds of the Town. Despite the fires, Salisbury and the country that surrounded it continued to grow, and Salisbury was considered to be the major town of the county. In 1909, the Humphrey&#x27;s Dam burst, flooding portions of Salisbury.

In 1867, when Wicomico County was formed out of parts of both Somerset and Worcester Counties, Salisbury became the government seat.

In 1898 and 1931, three Black men were lynched in Salisbury. Town leaders, including the fire chief and police chief, were allegedly complicit in the lynchings.

In 1968, protests occurred in Salisbury after a police officer fatally shot a deaf and mute African-American man. The protests prompted Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew to declare Martial Law and send the Maryland National Guard to Salisbury.

Today, Salisbury attracts a wide variety of different businesses in addition to the county, state, and federal government offices.

Adding to the diversity of Salisbury, the City is host to a wide variety of events celebrating local culture and the arts. These events include 3rd Friday, an event held in downtown Salisbury on the third Friday of each month, celebrating local music, artists, and nonprofit organizations.

Salisbury is also home to a historical City Park, the Salisbury Zoo, The Centre at Salisbury shopping mall, and the Wicomico Youth &amp; Civic Center.

==Crime==
===Notable crimes===
Garfield King () was a black man lynched by a mob in Salisbury. He was hung next to the courthouse after he reportedly shot Herman Kenney, a 22-year-old white man with a revolver after arguing with him.

In December 1931, Salisbury was the site of another lynching of a black man. Matthew Williams was accused of murdering his white employer, Daniel J. (DJ) Elliot, at his office on Lake Street. The authorities found D.J. Elliot dead at his desk, his son, James Elliot present, and Matthew Williams incapacitated by several gunshot wounds. After being taken to Peninsula General Hospital, a 300-man white mob threw Williams from a second-floor window to the crowd below, where he was stabbed, tied to a truck and dragged three blocks to the county court house. There they hanged him from a tree, before he had any chance of a trial. The mob paraded Williams&#x27; body through the black part of Salisbury for intimidation, and mutilated and burned him. It was the 32nd lynching in Maryland since 1882. No one was prosecuted for Williams&#x27; killing, as was typical in lynchings. As of 2007, there was no commemoration of the extrajudicial killing.

A 2017 memorial for Matthew Williams reignited the call for commemoration of the lynchings, with the known location of Matthew Williams&#x27; lynching (Wicomico County Circuit Courthouse lawn) emerging as the focal point. On this site, however, stood a sign some saw as antithetical to the sacred nature of the site as the location of one of the last lynchings in Maryland: a marker commemorating Confederate General John H. Winder. A 2018 documentary film (&quot;The Sign&quot;) was produced, documenting and unraveling the complexities of this conflict, &quot;exposing deep wounds from the complicated history of the Eastern Shore.&quot;

In January 2020, Mayor Jake Day announced the formation of a Lynching Memorial Task Force which was tasked with &quot;coordinating with the Equal Justice Initiative&#x27;s Community Remembrance Project to facilitate the creation of a permanent monument in honor and solemn remembrance of the three American citizens who lost their lives at the hands of lynch mobs in Wicomico County.&quot;

On July 5, 2023, a mass shooting occurred during a block party just outside of the city limits, leading to the death of a 14-year-old child and seven other injuries. Following an investigation involving the Wicomico County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and the Salisbury Police Department, the suspected shooter was arrested on September 11.

===Statistics===

Crime in 2019 was the lowest in the city&#x27;s history, with the five safest years on record being 1986, 1996, 2016, 2018, and 2019. Part One crimes, which are included in the table to the right, consist of the more serious crimes, including shoplifting, burglary, assault, theft, and rape.

<text>Berlin is a town in Worcester County, Maryland, United States which includes its own historical Berlin Commercial District. The population was 4,485 at the 2010 census, and has since grown in population. It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The town of Berlin lies over land that was originally the 300-acre Burley Plantation, patented by William Tomkins in 1677. With the development of ancient Native American migratory and hunting trails into colonial highways, the Burley Plantation became a crossroads of a post road leading to Philadelphia (today&#x27;s Main Street) and the Sinepuxent Road. Berlin developed in the early-19th century at this crossroads, where a tavern, blacksmith shop, and livery were among the first established businesses in the new town. Regional tradition asserts that the pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name, &quot;Burl&#x27;in&quot; with emphasis on the first syllable, stems from the &quot;Burley Inn&quot;, the early tavern that stood at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post and Sinepuxent Roads.

Soon after the Civil War, Berlin was incorporated as a town in 1868 and a period of significant growth ensued. Within the next decade, the arrival of the Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia Railroad made Berlin into a commercial center for upper Worcester County. After a fire in 1895 leveled a significant portion of the central commercial district, Victorian structures displaying elements of Queen Anne, Italianate, and Second Empire styles were erected along Main Street. The rise of nearby Ocean City as a tourist destination in the early-twentieth century also aided Berlin&#x27;s economy by making the town a convenient rest stop. Just to the north of the town center of Berlin is Ocean Pines, Maryland, a waterfront census-designated place (CDP) that shares the same ZIP code as Berlin.

Since the late 1980s, the town has undergone considerable revitalization of its historic downtown commercial district and adjacent residential areas. Berlin&#x27;s historic residential areas feature nearly two centuries of architectural heritage from three distinct periods: Federal, Victorian, and 20th Century. Forty-seven of these structures have been noted in the National Register of Historic Places and the Berlin Commercial District. Berlin has also been designated as a &quot;Main Street Community&quot; by the State of Maryland in recognition of its revitalization progress.

In addition to the Berlin Commercial District, the Buckingham Archeological Site, Burley Manor, Caleb&#x27;s Discovery, Fassitt House, Genesar, Henry&#x27;s Grove, Merry Sherwood and Williams Grove are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Berlin is located at 38°20&#x27;N 75°13&#x27;W (38.3311,-75.2140).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

US 50 bypasses the town to the north on the Ocean Gateway and heads west to Salisbury and east to Ocean City. US 113 bypasses the town to the east on Worcester Highway and heads north to Selbyville, Delaware and south toward Snow Hill and Pocomoke City. Maryland Route 818 runs north-south through the center of Berlin on Main Street and connects to US 113 on both ends of town. Maryland Route 346 passes through the northern part of Berlin on Old Ocean City Boulevard, connecting to US 50 east and west of the town.

===Utilities===
The Berlin Electric Utility Department provides electricity to Berlin, serving 3,500 customers. The electric utility operates a power plant along Williams Street in Berlin that generates some of its electricity while it also purchases power from outside sources. On September 19, 2006, residents of Berlin voted in favor of selling the town&#x27;s electric department to Choptank Electric Cooperative, a move supported by the mayor and town council because of the utility&#x27;s debt and high rates but opposed by the Berlin Utility Commission because of the feared loss of revenue. Under this arrangement, Choptank Electric Cooperative would have taken over the distribution system while Old Dominion Electric Cooperative would have taken over the town&#x27;s power plant. The sale fell through in 2007 after Old Dominion Electric Cooperative backed out of the deal because it felt the town&#x27;s power plant did not meet the environmental standard for a residential area; Choptank Electric Cooperative soon backed out too.

The Sanitation Division of the Public Works department provides trash and recycling collection to Berlin. Sandpiper Energy, a subsidiary of Chesapeake Utilities, provides natural gas to Berlin.

<text>Ocean City, officially the Town of Ocean City, is an Atlantic resort town in Worcester County, Maryland, along the East Coast of the United States. The population was 6,844 at the 2020 U.S. census, although during summer weekends the city hosts between 320,000 and 345,000 vacationers and up to eight million visitors annually. During the summer, Ocean City becomes the second most populated municipality in Maryland, after Baltimore. It is part of the Salisbury metropolitan area as defined by the United States Census Bureau.

In the summer, businesses and government agencies are augmented with approximately 1000 plus seasonal police officers, plus extra firefighters and other workers. Numerous events take place within the town during the shoulder-season, including Sunfest, Springfest, Bike Week, Cruisin&#x27; Weekend, Winterfest of Lights, and Reach the Beach, which take place on the Boardwalk and in the Roland E. Powell Convention Center. Ocean City is also home to the annual Maryland State Firefighters Convention, a week-long event in June that honors the state&#x27;s firefighters.

==History==
===19th century===
Before the European colonization of what is now Maryland in the 17th century, the shoreline of the Delmarva Peninsula had been populated for thousands of years by Indigenous peoples including the Algonquian-speaking Assateague and Nanticoke peoples. The land on which the city was built and much of the surrounding area was obtained by Thomas Fenwick, an Englishman, from the Indigenous peoples of the region. In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stagecoach and ferry.

Soon after, other simple boarding houses were built on the strip of sand, with the activity attracting prominent businessmen from the Maryland Eastern Shore, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Wilmington, Delaware. They came not so much to visit as to survey the spit. A decision was made to develop it and 250 lots were cut into it, and a corporation was formed to help with the development of the land. The corporation stock of 4,000 shares sold for $25 each.

Before 1870, what is now Ocean City was known as &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Resort to the Ocean&quot;.

The Atlantic Hotel, the first major hotel in the town, opened July 4, 1875. The Atlantic Hotel originally was owned by the Atlantic Hotel Company, but eventually Charles W. Purnell bought it in 1923. , it is still owned and operated by the Purnell family. Besides the beach and ocean, it offered dancing and billiard rooms to the visitors of its more than 400 rooms, and for years it was the northernmost attraction in Ocean City. By 1878, tourists could come by the Wicomico &amp; Pocomoke Railroad from Berlin to the shores of Sinepuxent Bay across from the town. By 1881, a line was completed across Sinepuxent Bay to the shore, bringing rail passengers on the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad directly into the town to a train station on Philadelphia Avenue and returning to larger city markets with locally caught fish from Ocean City.

===20th century===

In 1930, Ocean City Beach Patrol was formed in order to better protect the bathers that frequented the shoreline. It was done in collaboration with Mayor William W. McCabe and Coast Guard Captain William Purnell. The first guard, Edward Lee Carey, watched over bathers who swam out of sight from the original Coast Guard tower on Caroline Street.

The Ocean City Inlet was formed during a significant hurricane in 1933, which also destroyed the train tracks across the Sinepuxent Bay. The inlet separated what is now Ocean City from Assateague Island. The Army Corps of Engineers took advantage of nature&#x27;s intervention and made permanent the inlet at the south end of Ocean City. The inlet eventually helped establish Ocean City as an important Mid-Atlantic fishing port, as it offered easy access to the Atlantic Ocean fishing grounds.

In the late 1930s, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged a new channel on the bayside of Ocean City to allow larger boats to have access to Sinepuxent Bay. The dredge was pumped back onto the western shore of Ocean City allowing the creation of Chicago Avenue and St. Louis Avenue, leading to new development where previously only marshland had been.

Ocean City has undergone a fairly rapid expansion that took place during the post-World War II boom. In 1952, with the completion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, Ocean City became easily accessible to people in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area. In 1964, with the completion of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, a whole new pathway to the south was opened. This tunnel connects Northampton County on the Delmarva Peninsula to Southeast Virginia. Ocean City has become one of the largest vacation areas on the East Coast.

By the 1970s, big business flourished and gave birth to the construction of more than 15,000 condominium units, creating high-rise condominiums that gave investors a glimpse of the ocean and pounding surf. However, throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, the width of the beach began to shrink, prompting the first of a series of beach replenishment projects. The defunct Sea Scape Motel was the first motel to get an elevator.

A fire during the annual Sunfest destroyed five boardwalk businesses in 1994. There was a small water park and giant walk-through haunted house with live actors near the end of the pier and a New Orleans-style Hollywood in Wax Museum on the boardwalk side. In the mid 1990s, the wax museum closed and was turned into a arena. The building now houses the Ripley&#x27;s Believe it or Not! museum.

===21st century===
In 2002, Ocean City undertook a multi-million dollar beach restoration program in an attempt to slow the westward migration of its beaches. The program pumped tons of sand from offshore and deposited it onto the beach. A dune line was also re-established in front of Ocean City&#x27;s building line. Another similar project began after the 2006 tourist season closed.

In 2006, the city erected the Ocean City Firefighter&#x27;s Memorial to honor local firefighters as well as firefighters who died in the September 11 attacks. In addition to a statue of a firefighter, the monument incorporates a piece of steel beam from one of the towers destroyed at the World Trade Center.

In 2011 the resort area accommodated approximately 8 million visitors per year.

In 2022, the Town of Ocean City announced the inaugural Oceans Calling Festival, a four-day music event drawing major artists such as the Dave Mathews Band, Cyndi Lauper, The Lumineers, and Alanis Morissette. However, Tropical Storm Ian forced the event to be rescheduled for fall 2023.

Ocean City continues to sprawl westward across the bay, toward Berlin and Ocean Pines. It was part of the Ocean Pines micropolitan statistical area until that was subsumed by the Salisbury metropolitan area.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Ocean City is on the barrier spit called Fenwick Island, which encompasses Ocean City, as well as South Bethany and Fenwick Island, Delaware. Ocean City&#x27;s southern point is an inlet formed by the 1933 Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane. Rainfall and tides swelled the rivers and bays surrounding Ocean City until the overflowing water cut a 50-foot crevasse from the bay to the ocean. Ocean City businessmen had long sought funding to create an inlet to support a harbor, so residents seized upon the opportunity and built jetties to ensure the city&#x27;s land remained divided from what is now Assateague Island.

===Climate===

==Arts and culture==
=== Ocean City Boardwalk and Trimper&#x27;s ===
The Ocean City Boardwalk currently runs from South 2nd Street at the Ocean City Inlet in South Ocean City (by the Ocean City Life Saving Station Museum) up to 27th Street in South Ocean City. The boardwalk is home to food, shops, arcades, and amusements.

Originally called the &quot;Atlantic Avenue&quot;, the first Ocean City boardwalk was constructed in 1902. After being damaged by a storm in 1962, the boardwalk was rebuilt to stretch a total of 2.25 miles, which is its current length. In 1985, the boardwalk suffered extensive storm damage during Hurricane Gloria, which pummeled Ocean City with 89 MPH winds; however, the boardwalk was refurbished and a concrete sea wall was soon constructed to prevent further damage. The aftermath of Hurricane Gloria led to the first phase of extensive beach replenishment projects in Ocean City.

In 2012, the Ocean City Boardwalk was damaged again as a result of Hurricane Sandy, which flooded and destroyed half the boardwalk. The boardwalk has since been rebuilt to its original length and attracts many tourists.

Also located in South Ocean City is Trimper&#x27;s Rides, a historic amusement park founded in 1893 as The Windsor Resort. Trimper&#x27;s Rides is home to one of the United States&#x27; oldest operational carousel rides. Colloquially known as &quot;The Pride of the Boardwalk,&quot; the 1912 Herschell-Spillman carousel received the National Carousel Association&#x27;s Historic Carousel Award in 1996.

<text>Ocean Pines is a census-designated place (CDP) in Worcester County, Maryland, United States. The population was 11,710 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. It shares the same ZIP code as Berlin.

The community began as a small resort in 1968 and today is the largest residential community in Worcester County. It hosts the largest concentration of retirees on the Eastern Shore. During the summer months, Ocean Pines&#x27; population swells by more than 50 percent.

==History==
Prior to the late 1960s, Ocean Pines was a small community, composed primarily of retirees. On May 16, 1968, the Eastern Shore Times newspaper reported the rumor that a multi-million dollar land development project was being considered by the Boise Cascade Corporation in the &quot;Hog Skull&quot; area just north of Berlin. The company began development of the first phase of Ocean Pines on July 12, 1968 and continued at a rapid pace throughout the 1970s. Boise Cascade utilized unique marketing strategies to sell lots &quot;in the middle of nowhere&quot;, including Hawaiian luaus, a private clubhouse and pool on the beach of Ocean City, and transportation to Ocean Pines by a double-decker bus and an engine-operated paddlewheel boat named the &quot;Amy Ross&quot;. During the 1980s and 1990s, it was normal for 400 new homes to be constructed in the area annually. At the end of 1996, there were 7,381 platted lots and 5,269 dwelling units in the CDP.

In 1969, the Maryland State Highway Administration completed construction on Maryland Route 90, which ran through Ocean Pines and provided access to Ocean City.

Cable television first came to Ocean Pines in 1979 with Triad CATV. Simmons Cable TV took over the agreement with the Ocean Pines Association after acquiring Triad in 1987. Simmons was sold to American Cable TV Investors 5 Ltd. in 1992 and was later acquired by Mediacom in 1997. Mediacom was the only cable and internet service provider in the CDP until 2019, when the Association ratified a 10-year agreement with Comcast.

In 1984, Gerald S. Klein bought $55 million in property for development using Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan assets including a $2 million Maryland Marine wastewater plant. Maple Lawn and Burleigh developer partner Stuart Greenbaum, purchased 800 additional acres for subdivision. In 1985, Worcester County commissioners condemned the Maryland Marine Systems Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan owned sewer system embroiled in the Jeffery Levitt Scandal in order to remove a development moratorium. The system had failed to implement $1.3 million in required maintenance to prevent sewer overflow into the streets creating the moratorium.

In 1994, Balfour Holdings purchased $6–8 million in property. In 1995, Balfour representatives presented the Ocean Pines Association with a plan for a library, post office, church, recreational complex, school, and shopping areas. In October, Balfour and the Ocean Pines Association entered into a turnover agreement for the land.

In 2018, Ocean Pines celebrated its 50th anniversary.

It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. Pocomoke City is a center for commerce on the lower shore, home to an industrial park currently playing host to defense contractors, aerospace engineering, and plastics fabrication. Pocomoke City is located near the Wallops Island Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Virginia.

==History==

Beginning in the late seventeenth century, a small settlement called Stevens Landing (sometimes Stevens Ferry) grew at the ferry landing on the south bank of the Pocomoke River. The town was incorporated as Newtown (or New Town) in 1865, but was reincorporated in 1878 as Pocomoke City, after the American Indian name of the river, meaning &quot;black water.&quot;

Stevens Landing, and then Newtown, remained a modest river crossing until the construction through the town in the 1880s of the trunk railroad line along the Delmarva Peninsula from Wilmington, Delaware, to Cape Charles on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. The line eventually became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad. In addition to agriculture, industry such as lumber milling and shipbuilding and, in the twentieth century, factories making barrels and baskets for truck crops, and the canning of those crops, aided the town&#x27;s growth.

In 1922, the business district of Pocomoke City was destroyed in a large fire; on one side of town this continued up to the church on third Street, known as St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church, but the downtown was quickly rebuilt. While truck farming declined during the 1900s, the poultry industry rose to take its place. NASA, the U.S. Navy, and the Coast Guard helped with continued growth by bringing jobs to the area. 

Pocomoke City was named an All-America City by the National Municipal League, and for the years 1984–85, Pocomoke City was one of the nine Finalist Communities.

<text>Snow Hill is a town and the county seat of Worcester County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,156 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Snow Hill was founded in 1686 in Somerset County by English settlers, who may have named it after a street and neighborhood of the City of London called &quot;Snow Hill&quot; despite the location&#x27;s elevation of just above sea level and the infrequency of snowfall. The town received its first charter on October 26, 1686, and was made a port of entry in 1694.

In 1742, Worcester County was carved out of the eastern half of old Somerset County and Snow Hill, centrally located in the new county and at the head of navigation on the Pocomoke River, was made the county seat.

Major fires in 1844 and 1893 destroyed the center of Snow Hill, including two successive court houses, but some 18th-century structures survived both fires. Following the second fire, much of the commercial area was rapidly rebuilt, so the downtown today contains many historic buildings of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Snow Hill Historic District, which includes approximately 80% of the town, was created in 2002.

In December 2010, a Snow Hill businessman started a petition to remove the town&#x27;s incorporation and revert the area to county control. The reasons given were lower county taxes, better services provided to the town, and a need for revitalization. The push was abandoned in January 2011.

The All Hallows Episcopal Church, Chanceford, Old Friendship United Methodist Church, Samuel Gunn House, Makemie Memorial Presbyterian Church, James Martin House, Nassawango Iron Furnace Site, Nun&#x27;s Green, George Washington Purnell House, and Gov. John Walter Smith House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Snow Hill is located at (38.175024, -75.390738).

<text>Stockton is a census-designated place (CDP) in Worcester County, Maryland, United States. The population was 92 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Stockton, originally called Sandy Hill, grew up at the crossing of the post road from Snow Hill south to Virginia (whose track is generally followed by modern Maryland Route 12) with the road from Mattapony Landing on the Pocomoke River to the Chincoteague Bay (the eastern part of which is now Maryland Route 366), where small ocean-going vessels could drop anchor. The landing on Chincoteague Bay came to be known as George Island Landing. Settlement in the area began in the 1660s, when the area was still part of Somerset County. Worcester County was separated from Somerset in 1742, and by 1774 Sandy Hill had grown large enough to merit a chapel of ease within All Hallows&#x27; Parish, today called Holy Cross Chapel. Sandy Hill, unlike neighboring Girdletree, was never incorporated, but in 1870 the name of the town was officially changed, by act of the legislature, from Sandy Hill to Stockton, commemorating the Rev. Thomas H. Stockton, a prominent Methodist minister. In 1872 the Worcester County election district which took its name from Sandy Hill was renamed Stockton.

In 1876, a railroad (which would eventually become part of the Pennsylvania Railroad) was laid from Franklin City and Greenbackville in Virginia to Snow Hill. The line&#x27;s main purpose was to haul seafood harvested from the Atlantic Ocean and Chincoteague Bay to Philadelphia, but the line also carried passengers. To avoid confusion with other Stocktons around the country, the station at Stockton was named Hursley Station.

The center of Stockton was destroyed by fire in 1906, but was soon rebuilt, with many of the new buildings constructed of brick. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Stockton boasted a hotel, five churches, a post office, three stores, a canning factory, two sawmills, and two barrel factories. However, the overfishing of Chincoteague Bay led to a permanent decline in the commercial seafood industry.

A new Stockton High School was dedicated in 1926. Grades 7-11 were discontinued in 1942, but first through sixth grades continued until 1960, when the school was closed. Stockton&#x27;s only bank failed in 1929. Passenger trains ended service in the late 1940s, and the last freight trainmade its final run through Stockton in approximately 1955. Holy Cross Chapel stopped holding regular services in 1943. Gunby Presbyterian Church holds only one service per month. The Stockton Poultry Plant opened as World War II ended, but closed around 1970. Today, Stockton residents are as likely to work at NASA&#x27;s Wallops Island Flight Facility on the Eastern Shore of Virginia than to be farmers or watermen. The post office was closed in 2012, and no business of any kind is now in operation.

<doc id="116647" wikidata="Q2303096" url="?curid=116647" title="Eastham, Massachusetts">
<text>Eastham () is a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, United States, Barnstable County being coextensive with Cape Cod. The population was 5,752 at the 2020 census.

For geographic and demographic information about the village of North Eastham, please see North Eastham, Massachusetts.

==History==
Originally inhabited by the Nauset tribe, Eastham was the site of the 1620 landing of a hunting party from the sailing vessel &quot;Mayflower&quot;, which had stopped in Provincetown harbor on Cape Cod Bay after a rough crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. This led to the first encounter of the Pilgrims with the local Nauset people at what became known as First Encounter Beach. The area would not be settled by Europeans, however, until 1644. The original lands included what are now the towns of Truro, Wellfleet, Eastham, Orleans and a small portion of Chatham. Eastham town was officially incorporated in 1651.

Eastham is the birthplace of Freeman Hatch, who in 1853 set the world record for a single-hull wooden sailing vessel from San Francisco around Cape Horn to Boston at the helm of the clipper ship &quot;Northern Light&quot;. Fishing and especially farming were early industries in the town, and writers and artists also came to the town. Gustavus Franklin Swift, born in Sagamore, MA, began his first meatpacking business in Eastham. It later moved to Brighton, MA, Albany, NY, and eventually started the meatpacking industry in Chicago. It was in Eastham that Henry Beston wrote &quot;The Outermost House.&quot; The town is discussed at some length in Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Cape Cod&quot; as the somewhat rugged site of one of New England&#x27;s largest summer &quot;camp-meeting&quot; evangelistic gatherings in the mid-19th century. The gatherings were at times attended by at least &quot;one hundred and fifty ministers (!) and five thousand hearers&quot; at a site called Millennium Grove, in the northwest part of town. (The area is now a residential neighborhood, among the only reminders being Campground Road and Millennium Lane.)

Today, Eastham is known as the &quot;Gateway” to the Cape Cod National Seashore, which was founded in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to protect Cape Cod&#x27;s coast from erosion and overpopulation. The town is the site of many beaches, both on the Atlantic and on Cape Cod Bay, as well as the Nauset Light, which was moved to the town in 1923 from its former location in Chatham, and the Three Sisters Lighthouses, which have since been moved away from their now-eroded perches on the coast to a field just west of Nauset Light.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 45.68%, is water. It is bordered by Cape Cod Bay and the Atlantic Ocean on its western and eastern sides, respectively. Eastham is also bordered by the towns of Wellfleet and Orleans on its northern and southern sides, respectively. Eastham is located on the &quot;forearm&quot; of Cape Cod, and is south of Provincetown, the same distance east-northeast of Barnstable, east of the Sagamore Bridge, and (by land) southeast of Boston.

Approximately one-third of the town is located within the Cape Cod National Seashore. There are several freshwater ponds near the center of town, the largest being called Great Pond, which has two public beaches. Powerboats with 50 and under horsepower motors are allowed on Great Pond after receiving an inspection and sticker from the Natural Resources Department. Water skiing is permitted only on Great Pond and only on even numbered days. On all other Eastham freshwater ponds motorboats three horsepower and under are allowed. Along the Atlantic coast, portions of the CCNS include several islands, divided by channels which lead from Nauset Bay and Salt Pond Bay to the ocean. The town also shares Town Cove with neighboring Orleans. Several creeks and the Herring River run inland from the bay side.

==Climate==

The town of Eastham has a mild summer Humid continental climate (Dfb). The plant hardiness zone is 7a, with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 4.1 °F (–15.5 °C). The average seasonal (Nov-Apr) snowfall total is approximately 30 inches (76 cm). The average snowiest month is February, which corresponds to the annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity.

==Transportation==
U.S. Route 6 passes from south to north through the town. The Cape Cod Rail Trail, as well as several other bicycle routes, also pass through the town. There is no rail or air service in town; the nearest regional air service is at the Chatham Municipal Airport, though better and more regularly scheduled air service between the Cape and Boston can be found in Provincetown and Hyannis through Cape Air, and the nearest national and international air service can be found at Logan International Airport in Boston. Eastham is also served by an inexpensive regional bus service, The Flex.
