== History ==

Chartered in 1765 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, the town is named for Henry Seymour Conway, ambitious son of a prominent English family, who was elected to the House of Commons at age 20, fought at Culloden, and became Secretary of State. Early settlers called the area Pequawket (known colloquially as &quot;Pigwacket&quot;), adopting the name of the Abenaki Indian village which stretched down the Saco River to its stockaded center at Fryeburg, Maine.

North Conway is in the White Mountains, with Mount Washington to the northwest. The rugged terrain became popular in the 19th century with artists. Their paintings were known collectively as White Mountain art, which in turn attracted tourists to the area, particularly after the Portsmouth, Great Falls &amp; Conway Railroad extended service in 1872 to North Conway. In 1874, the line built a Second Empire depot, designed by Nathaniel J. Bradlee. In 1932, &quot;snow trains&quot; began carrying enthusiasts to &quot;the birthplace of American skiing&quot;, as North Conway is known.
North Conway remains a popular destination due to its shopping, recreation, and attractions.

==Recreation==

North Conway and its surrounding towns offer hiking in the White Mountain National Forest. The area is a major rock climbing destination in the northeastern United States, particularly Cathedral Ledge in Echo Lake State Park. The cliff overloOKS Echo Lake and North Conway from the west. Unlike nearby White Horse Ledge, another rock climbing site, Cathedral Ledge has an automobile road to the summit, which provides fine views of the Saco River Valley.

In late September through early October, tourists arrive to see the autumn foliage on the surrounding mountains and forests. The Conway Scenic Railroad features train rides that leave from the village&#x27;s Victorian station. In the winter, the village is the nighttime destination for skiers visiting the area resorts, including North Conway&#x27;s own Cranmore Mountain as well as nearby Attitash Mountain Resort, Black Mountain and Wildcat Mountain.

North Conway is home to the Green Hills Preserve. The preserve encompasses several mountains in the Mt. Washington Valley, and is a low north-south running mountain ridge flanking the east side of Route 16. The preserve includes Rattlesnake Mountain, Middle Mountain, Peaked Mountain, and Black Cap mountain.

<text>Ossipee is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,372 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Carroll County. Ossipee, which includes several villages, is a resort area and home to part of Pine River State Forest.

==History==

Originally known as &quot;Wigwam Village&quot;, and then &quot;New Garden&quot;, the town was named for the Ossipee Indians, one of the twelve Algonquian tribes. It was once the site of an Indian stockade fort, designed to protect the tribe from the Mohawks in the west. In 1725, the Indian stockade was destroyed, and then rebuilt by Captain John Lovewell. The new fort was one of the largest in New England. The fort was located where the second green of Indian Mound Golf now is. Wood, ramrods and the brass bolt used for the gate were discovered when the course was built. On February 22, 1785, the legislature incorporated Ossipee as a town.

Although the surface of the town is &quot;rough and uneven, and in some parts rocky and mountainous,&quot; farmers found it suitable for pasturage, as well as for cultivating wheat and potatoes. Principal goods were produce, lumber and cattle. In 1859, when the population was 2,123, Ossipee contained twelve sawmills, five gristmills, twelve clapboard and shingle mills, one bedstead factory, one door factory, a sash and blind factory, one paper mill and four tanneries. The Portsmouth, Great Falls &amp; Conway Railroad in 1871 reached Ossipee Corner, with service extended in 1875 to Center Ossipee. The trains brought commerce and tourists, helping the town develop as a summer resort. Railroad service, however, would be discontinued in 1961 for passengers, and in 1972 for freight.

The town shares its name with the Ossipee Mountains, a circular mountain range marking the location of an ancient volcanic ring dike, which borders it on the west. Ossipee is a major source of sand and gravel, transported by railroad to Boston.

Ossipee claims to be the home of the first snowmobile. In 1917, Virgil D. White set up to create a patent for his conversion kit that changed the Ford Model T into a &quot;snowmobile&quot;. He also copyrighted the term &quot;snowmobile&quot;. At the time, the conversion kit was expensive, costing about $395. Virgil White applied his patent in 1918 and created his own snowmobile. In 1922, his conversion kit was on the markets and available only through Ford dealerships.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 6.38% of the town. Ossipee is drained by the Ossipee River and its tributaries. Ossipee Lake, in the northeastern part of the town, is the source of the Ossipee River and receives its tributaries the Pine, Beech, Bearcamp and Lovell rivers. The highest point in Ossipee is above sea level on an unnamed ridge in the Ossipee Mountains in the western part of town.

The town is crossed by state routes 16, 25, 28 and 171.

The two primary settlements in town are Center Ossipee, located near the southern junction of routes 16 and 25, and Ossipee Corner (shown as &quot;Ossipee&quot; on topographic maps), located south of Center Ossipee at the junction of routes 28 and 171 and close to Route 16. Other villages include West Ossipee, at the northern junction of routes 16 and 25 near the border with Tamworth; Moultonville, directly west of Center Ossipee; and Water Village, along Route 171 near the border with Tuftonboro.

<text>Sandwich is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. Its population was 1,466 at the 2020 census. Sandwich includes the villages of Center Sandwich and North Sandwich. Part of the White Mountain National Forest is in the north, and part of Squam Lake is in the southwestern corner of the town. As such, Sandwich lies on the boundary between New Hampshire&#x27;s Lakes Region and White Mountains Region. The Sandwich Range of the White Mountains lies partially within the town, as does the namesake Sandwich Mountain. The town is home to the Sandwich Fair, a popular agricultural fair that occurs every October.

== History ==
Chartered in 1763 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, the land was considered so inaccessible that the grant was enlarged, making Sandwich one of the largest towns in the state. It was named in honor of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, said to be the inventor of the sandwich.

The earliest European settlers arrived in 1767. By 1830 Sandwich had grown to a population of 2,700, nearly double the current (2020) population. At that time the town contained farms, stores, mills, churches, schools, carpenters, blacksmiths, and wheelwrights.

By the end of the 1800s much of the population had left Sandwich to live in cities to the west. Sandwich began to be an attraction for visitors, summer residents and artists, which continues to this day.

<text>Tamworth is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,812 at the 2020 census. Tamworth includes the villages of Chocorua, South Tamworth, Wonalancet, and Whittier. The White Mountain National Forest is to the north. The town is home to Hemenway State Forest in the north and White Lake State Park in the southeast.

Granted in 1766 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, this town was named in honor of his close friend, British Admiral Washington Shirley, Viscount Tamworth. The admiral&#x27;s daughter, Selina Shirley, was instrumental in the founding of Dartmouth College. The village of Whittier, like Mount Whittier in Ossipee, is named for the poet John Greenleaf Whittier.

Arthur Treadwell Walden&#x27;s Chinook Kennels raised sled dogs for Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd&#x27;s Antarctic expeditions and the Army&#x27;s search-and-rescue units. The Barnstormers Theatre summer playhouse was established here in 1931 by Francis Grover Cleveland, son of President Grover Cleveland. He supported the theater until his death in 1995. Barnstormers is hailed as the oldest continuously running professional theater in the state.

At the turn of the 20th century, many people traveled to the White Mountains of New Hampshire seeking haven from the noise of the cities and the business of urban life. Thinkers, artists and writers such as William and Henry James, E.E. Cummings, friends and descendants of Julia Ward Howe and many others vacationed in the Tamworth area. Inns and resorts, such as the Wonalancet Inn owned by Katherine Sleeper Walden, helped to encourage tourism and vacationing in the Tamworth area.

==History==

Tuftonboro was the only incorporated place in New Hampshire owned by just one man, John Tufton Mason, for whom the town was named. Following the 1741 separation of New Hampshire from Massachusetts, Mason was heir to the Masonian Claim, the undivided lands of northern New Hampshire. He sold them in 1746 to a group of Portsmouth merchants, thereafter known as the Masonian Proprietors. They disposed of the land via grants to prospective settlers prior to the Revolution.

The town was granted as &quot;Tuftonborough&quot; in 1750 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, and first settled about 1780. It was incorporated by the legislature on December 17, 1795. By 1859, when the population was 1,305, the principal occupation was raising cattle and sheep across the hilly terrain. Other industries included two sawmills, one sash, blind and door factory, one carriage factory, and two gristmills.

==Geography==

The highest point in Tuftonboro is the south peak of Mount Shaw, elevation above sea level, on the town&#x27;s northwestern boundary.

The northern portion of Tuftonboro is occupied by the Ossipee Mountains. New Hampshire routes 171, 109, and 109A cross the town, all generally in a northwest to southeast direction.

Melvin Village, in the west part of Tuftonboro, is a summer vacation spot on Melvin Bay of Lake Winnipesaukee. It has a marina and many lakeside homes and cottages that are for rent. It is also a popular spot for antique shopping. The community of Mirror Lake is in the southern part of the town, on the southwestern side of the lake of the same name.

<text>Wakefield is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,201 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Wakefield Corner (the original town center), East Wakefield, North Wakefield, Sanbornville, Union, Woodman and Province Lake. Wakefield Corner, popular with tourists, is a picturesque hilltop village of antique buildings. The state of Maine forms the eastern border of Wakefield.

==History==
Initially a native settlement, Wakefield was attacked by John Lovewell during Father Rale&#x27;s War. Settled later by colonists from Dover and Somersworth, the town was granted in 1749 by John Mason. It was called &quot;East Town&quot; before being incorporated as Wakefield in 1774 by Governor John Wentworth. Wakefield, in Yorkshire, England, is near Wentworth Castle, the home of the Wentworth ancestors.

The New Hampshire town developed as an important sledge and stage stop between the seacoast and the White Mountains. The Wakefield Inn, built in 1804 beside the principal trade route through Wakefield Corner, remains operating today.

Although the soil was considered &quot;stubborn&quot;, farmers made it productive. Lumber became a chief product, and by 1859 there were five sawmills, five gristmills, and ten shingle, clapboard and planing mills. Shoemaking was another local industry. When the Portsmouth, Great Falls and Conway Railroad arrived in 1871, the center of Wakefield shifted from Wakefield Corner to Sanbornville, which today remains the retail district of town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 11.71% of the town.

Wakefield is at the head of several river systems. The northwestern part of the town is drained by the Pine River, a northwestward-flowing tributary of Ossipee Lake, which flows out to the east as the Ossipee River. Pine River Pond in Wakefield serves as the river&#x27;s headwaters. The northernmost corner of town is in Province Lake, which drains north into the South River, a tributary of the Ossipee River. Belleau Lake and Balch Pond drain the northeastern part of the town, flowing east into the Little Ossipee River in Maine, another tributary of the Ossipee River. Via the Ossipee, the north half of Wakefield is part of the Saco River watershed. Great East Lake is in the southeastern part of Wakefield, extending into Maine. The lake&#x27;s outlet is the headwaters of the Salmon Falls River, forming the New Hampshire-Maine boundary, and flowing south into Horn Pond. Lovell Lake, in the south-central part of the town, flows out to the west via the Branch River through Sanbornville. The river then turns south through Union Meadows in the southernmost part of the town, on its way to join the Salmon Falls River in Milton. Via the Salmon Falls, the southern half of Wakefield is part of the Piscataqua River watershed, reaching the Atlantic Ocean at Portsmouth. Of Wakefield&#x27;s lakes, Province, Balch, Great East, and Horn Pond span the Maine border. The highest point in Wakefield is the summit of Long Mountain, at above sea level, along the town&#x27;s western border.

Five named villages are within the town limits: Sanbornville, Wakefield village proper (&quot;Wakefield Corner&quot;), East Wakefield, North Wakefield and Union. Sanbornville, the primary settlement in the town, lies at the west end of Lovell Lake, next to the lake&#x27;s outlet. The village is at the intersection of New Hampshire Routes 109 and 153. Route 16 bypasses the village to the west. Wakefield village occupies a hill just north of Sanbornville on Route 153. The village of Union occupies the southernmost corner of the town, at the intersection of Route 153 and Route 16 (at the northern end of the Spaulding Turnpike). East Wakefield is on Route 153, containing the land east of Pine River Pond and north to the Effingham town line. North Wakefield lies along Route 16 on the west side of Pine River Pond near the town line with Ossipee.

<text>Alstead () is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,864 at the 2020 census. Alstead is home to Feuer State Forest.

==History==

The town was chartered by Massachusetts Governor Jonathan Belcher in 1735 as one in a line of nine forts intended to protect southwestern New Hampshire from Indian attack. It was granted as &quot;Newton&quot; or &quot;Newtown&quot; in 1752 by Governor Benning Wentworth, but would be incorporated in 1763 as Alstead. It was named for Johann Heinrich Alsted, who compiled an early encyclopedia that was popular at Harvard College. Settled about 1764, Alstead would be one of the towns that wavered in its allegiance after the Revolutionary War. It decided to join Vermont in April 1781, but at the insistence of George Washington, returned to New Hampshire authority early the next year.

Formerly known as &quot;Paper Mill Village&quot;, Alstead is the location of one of the state&#x27;s first paper mills. It was established in 1793 on the Cold River by Ephraim and Elisha Kingsbury. Paper was then a rare and expensive product, made by chopping rags of linen and cotton cloth into pulp. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1880. While Alstead was basically an agricultural community, its streams and ponds once powered a variety of small mills. A turbine water mill at East Alstead is probably the last of its type anywhere in the region.

Shedd-Porter Memorial Library, built in 1909–1910 in the Beaux-Arts style, was a gift to Alstead and Langdon by native son John G. Shedd, president of Marshall Field&#x27;s department store in Chicago. Another native son philanthropist, Charles M. Vilas, gave a large public recreation area, school building and the only carillon in Cheshire County.

On the weekend of October 8–9, 2005, parts of Alstead were devastated by a severe flood. Heavy rain in Cheshire County—at least in a 30-hour period—caused the Cold River and its tributaries to swell. The streamflows, which were swollen by the surge of water from Warren Brook, exceeded a 500-year recurrence interval. The storm created major property damage in Alstead, Langdon, and Walpole along the Cold River and Warren Brook. It washed away homes, cars, and of Route 123. Four inhabitants of the town were killed. A &quot;Save Our History&quot; grant from The History Channel provided funding to the Alstead Historical Society and several students of the local high school, who wrote and printed a book called &quot;Too Much Water, Too Much Rain&quot;, chronicling the disaster and its aftermath.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 1.44% of the town. Alstead is drained by the Cold River, and Lake Warren is in the eastern part of the town. The highest point in Alstead is Smith Hill, at above sea level. Alstead lies fully within the Connecticut River watershed.

The town is served by state routes 123, 123A and 12A.

==Frankford Village==
The village of Frankford Village was settled along the banks of Deer Creek in 1854 by Lewis Patchin, Bartlett Leathers, and Byron Woodworth. The town was platted in 1856 and it was declared the county seat. At one time it was a bustling frontier village that had three stores, a schoolhouse, a cemetery, three blacksmith and wagon shops, a gristmill, a chair and coffin factory, a shoe shop and the Patchin Hotel which also served as the post office. County court was held here and the county&#x27;s records were stored in an upstairs room of Patchin&#x27;s Hotel. After being passed over as the county&#x27;s seat, its population slowly dwindled. When the Southern Minnesota Railroad was laid in 1870 it ran four miles south of the village and this development is what ultimately spelled doom for the once-thriving community. Rather than move the city &quot;to&quot; the railroad as the citizens of the Old Village of Le Roy did, the citizens simply relocated to other parts of the township and county. All that is left of the old village is a cemetery, which is still used, that can be found in the northeast quadrant of section 24 of Frankford Township.

==Cemeteries==
*Frankford Cemetery is located in the northeast quadrant of section 24 of the township. It is directly south of the Old Frankford Village.
*Bear Creek Cemetery is located in the southeast quadrant of section 7 of the township. Its oldest known burial dates to 1872.
*Methodist Norwegian Cemetery is a deserted cemetery located in the southeast quadrant of section 7 of the township. Its last burial dates to 1940.
*Sever Temanson Cemetery is located in the southwest corner of the northwest quadrant of section 8 of the township. It is now not used, but it was used for burials between 1854 and 1870.

<text>Chesterfield is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 3,552 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of Spofford and West Chesterfield. Chesterfield is home to Spofford Lake, Chesterfield Gorge Natural Area, and parts of Pisgah State Park and Wantastiquet Mountain State Forest.

==History==
Granted in 1735 by Governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts, this town was the site of Fort Number 1, first in the line of forts bordering the Connecticut River. After the border between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was fixed, the town was incorporated on February 11, 1752 by Governor Benning Wentworth as Chesterfield, named for Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield. The first settlers were Moses Smith and William Thomas, who, with their families, came up the Connecticut in canoes, in the fall of 1761. Their chief subsistence through the winter and spring of their first year in the wilderness consisted of salmon and shad, of which there was a great abundance in the river, and deer, which were numerous in the forests. The town contains some of the finest farmland in Cheshire County, yet once was also home to small manufacturing, notably spinning wheel parts and hand tools.

In 1772, Philip Embury conducted the first Methodist religious services in New Hampshire at the James Robertson farm in Chesterfield, and in 1803, Francis Asbury preached here. Asbury Church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is recognized for its historic puritan design. Asbury Church is considered the &quot;Mother Church of Methodism&quot; in New Hampshire, and is the oldest Methodist church in the state. The town has had continual Methodist Sunday services for over 225 years.

Chesterfield Academy, established in 1794, was for decades one of the most celebrated in the state. Spofford Lake is one of the region&#x27;s largest and oldest resorts.

<text>Dublin is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,532 at the 2020 census. It is home to Dublin School and &quot;Yankee&quot; magazine.

==History==

In 1749, the Masonian proprietors granted the town as &quot;Monadnock No. 3&quot; (or North Monadnock) to Matthew Thornton and 39 others. The 40 grantees came mostly from middle and eastern parts of New Hampshire; none of them became settlers in the township. The deed of grant, which dated November 3, 1749, was given by Col. Joseph Blanchard of Dunstable.

The French and Indian War thwarted permanent settlement until the 1760s, when Irishman Henry Strongman moved from Peterborough. Other early settlers arrived from Sherborn, Massachusetts. In 1771, Governor John Wentworth incorporated the town, naming it after Strongman&#x27;s birthplace: Dublin, Ireland.

Like all towns in this area, the terrain features hills and valleys. Farmers found the soil hard and rocky, but with effort it yielded maize, oats, barley and potatoes, with some wheat and rye. Orchards were common. The first census, taken in 1790, reported 901 residents. By 1859, there were 1,088. In 1870, the small mill town of Harrisville voted to separate from Dublin, leaving the latter with only 455 residents during the 1880 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 3.78% of the town. The northern slopes of Mount Monadnock occupy the southern part of town. The highest point in Dublin is along Monadnock&#x27;s northeastern ridge, where the elevation reaches above sea level at the town line. Roughly the western half of Dublin lies within the Connecticut River watershed, drained by tributaries of the Ashuelot River, with the eastern half located in the Merrimack River watershed, drained by tributaries of the Contoocook River.

The ponds in Dublin include Monadnock Lake (now known as Dublin Pond), Farnum (Dark) Pond, and Wight Pond, as well as Howe, Knight, and Electric Company reservoirs.

Dublin Pond is a clean sheet of water that has brought many families of wealth to the area. It is surrounded by a vast area of woods leading to the edge of the summit of Mount Monadnock, and from its surface the summit and northwestern sides of the mountain are visible. At the right hour on the right kind of day, the mountain is clearly reflected upon the surface of the pond.

The town is crossed by New Hampshire Route 101 and New Hampshire Route 137. NH 101 leads east to Peterborough and west to Marlborough and to Keene. NH 137 leads north to Hancock and south to Jaffrey.

== The visit from ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá ==

In 1912, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, the son and chosen successor of the Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, the Prophet-Founder of the Baháʼí Faith, visited Dublin for 23 days, from July 25 to August 16, on his journey through the United States to spread the Bahá’í teachings after his release from 40 years of imprisonment. Spending the most consecutive days of his journey in Dublin, he gave many talks ranging from gender equality, the immortality of the soul, industrial and economic justice, the elimination of racial prejudice, spiritual and material education, Biblical symbolism, theology, the coming together of people from the East and the West, and other Bahá’í principles.

In Dublin, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá stayed with Agnes Parsons, a Bahá’í socialite from Washington, DC, and a summer resident of Dublin whose home once stood on Windmill Hill Road. The first of his two high-profile addresses in Dublin was at a gathering at the Parsons&#x27; boathouse on Dublin Pond, owned now by the Dublin School, with local non-resident African-American servants who worked in town. In this gathering he spoke on the need for unity and amity between blacks and whites and announced the interracial marriage of two young Bahá’ís, Louis Gregory, an African-American lawyer, and Louisa Mathew, a white English woman, whom he had previously suggested to marry each other. This act was considered radical at the time, with interracial marriage still illegal in many states.

Asked to speak at the local Unitarian church one Sunday, an event attracting some 300 people, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá spoke on the subject of spiritual education. The anniversary of his historic visit and address is commemorated annually by the church, known now as the Dublin Community Church. Rev. Howard Colby Ives, a Unitarian minister, wrote of that day,What His subject was I do not recall, nor does a single word of His address remain with me. My memory is all of the quiet New England church; the crowded pews, and ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá on the platform. His cream-colored robe; His white hair and beard; His radiant smile and courteous demeanor... And His voice! Like a resonant bell of finest timbre; never loud but of such penetrating quality that the walls of the room seemed to vibrate with its music.
‘Abdu’l‑Bahá spent time at the Dublin Inn, which has since been purchased and donated to the Bahá’í community as a space for gathering, prayer, meditation, and historic preservation.

== Current events ==
2019 is the 48th year for the Dublin Gas Engine Meet on Cricket Hill Farm, which is the longest lasting tradition in Dublin after Town Meeting. Every year, the town prepares starting in October for the Halloween events around town that occur each year.

<text>Lake Wilson is a city in Murray County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 254 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Lake Wilson was platted in 1883 and incorporated as a village on July 12, 1900. It was named by J. E. Wilson (a landowner in the area) who also named the nearby lake for himself.

On June 16, 1992, Lake Wilson was struck by a devastating F5 tornado that completely destroyed half of the town, which has since been rebuilt.

On January 12, 2004, the city&#x27;s firehall exploded, destroying it and the nearby elevator. It also damaged many nearby houses and businesses. The blast was audible at , and could be felt as far as away. The city estimated that recovery costs resulting from the explosion totaled about $4.2 million.

<text>Gilsum is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 752 at the 2020 census. Home to Bear&#x27;s Den Natural Area, Gilsum includes Gilsum Lower Village.

==History==

The land was originally named &quot;Boyle&quot; after Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington, when the land was granted by the Masonian Proprietors in 1752, but ongoing hostilities during the French and Indian War prevented settlement. When the grant lapsed, the town was rechartered by Governor Benning Wentworth on July 13, 1763, as Gilsum, in a portmanteau of the surnames of two proprietors, Samuel Gilbert and his son-in-law, Thomas Sumner. It was first settled in 1764 by Josiah Kilburn from Hebron, Connecticut.

The Ashuelot River provided water power for woolen mills. By 1859, when the population was 668, there was also a bobbin factory, a chair factory, and a tannery. Gilsum used to be a center for mining mica and feldspar. High-quality crystals, especially beryl, tourmaline, and quartz, can also be found. Today, Gilsum is headquarters to the W.S. Badger Company, makers of &quot;balms, potions and natural remedies.&quot;

The town contains the Stone Arch Bridge, completed in 1863 with the highest vault (36 feet, 6 inches) of any mortarless bridge in New Hampshire. In 1989, it was added to the National Register.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are water, comprising 0.13% of the town.

<text>Harrisville is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. Besides the town center, it also includes the villages of Chesham and Eastview. The population of the town was 984 at the 2020 census.

It is a preserved 19th-century mill town located in the Monadnock region of southern New Hampshire. There are nine bodies of water in the town, many back roads and trails to explore, and two original train depots at Harrisville and Chesham.

==History==
First known as &quot;Twitchell&#x27;s Mills&quot;, a combination sawmill and gristmill was built here in 1774. The town of Harrisville was formed in 1870 from lands ceded by Marlborough, Dublin, Hancock, Nelson, and Roxbury. The Manchester &amp; Keene Railroad opened in 1878, helping it prosper as a textile mill town. It was named for Milan Harris, whose stone and brick Cheshire Mills operated until 1970, but look virtually unchanged since the mid-19th century.

Today, the Cheshire Mills are protected as part of the Harrisville Historic District, a National Historic Landmark which includes the center of town. With its red brick buildings and mills reflected in Harrisville Pond and canal, the village is frequently photographed as an iconic example of picturesque old New England. The Harrisville Rural District includes the southern part of the town near the Dublin border.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 7.79% of the town. The highest point in Harrisville is the summit of Cobb Hill, at above sea level. Roughly the western half of Harrisville, drained by Minnewawa Brook, lies within the Ashuelot River watershed, part of the Connecticut River basin, while the eastern half, drained by Nubanusit Brook, is in the Contoocook River watershed, part of the Merrimack River basin. Significant water bodies include Silver Lake, Seaver Reservoir, and Chesham Pond on the western side, and Harrisville Pond and Skatutakee Lake draining to the east.

== Churches ==
The Community Church of Harrisville and Chesham was formed from Chesham Baptist Church and Harrisville Congregational Church. Chesham Baptist Church dates back to 1785. The church building was originally built in 1797, re-modeled in 1830, and again re-modeled in 1844. The Evangelical Congregational Church of Harrisville dates back to 1840, and the church building was erected in 1840–1843.

The Community Church is a member of the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the American Baptist Association, and it retains a united congregation using only the brick church in Harrisville village. The church in Chesham is owned by the American Baptist Association of Vermont &amp; New Hampshire and is no longer used by the Community Church of Harrisville &amp; Chesham.

Harrisville was home to St. Denis Parish of the Roman Catholic Church from 1902 to 2010, when services ended following the merger with Saint Peter Parish in Peterborough and Saint Patrick Parish in Bennington. The church building is now owned by Historic Harrisville and is referred to as St. Denis Hall.

It was regranted to its inhabitants in 1753 by Governor Benning Wentworth, who renamed it &quot;Keene&quot; after Sir Benjamin Keene, a principal of the South Sea Trading company whose primary business was slave trading.

A significant landmark in downtown Keene is the United Church of Christ at Central Square, colloquially known in town as the &quot;White Church&quot; or the &quot;Church at the Head of the Square&quot;. A second church on the square was Grace United Methodist Church, also known as the &quot;Brick Church&quot;, but it is now privately owned and operated for secular purposes. The Grace United Methodist congregation moved to another site.

Keene is the seat of the Roman Catholic Parish of the Holy Spirit, whose pastor is the Dean of the Monadnock Deanery, a division under the see of the Diocese of Manchester. The parish has two churches in the City of Keene, Saint Bernard and Saint Margaret Mary. Keene has one Episcopal church, Saint James, which is within the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. Keene also has one Greek Orthodox church, Saint George, which is under the see of the Metropolis of Boston.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints building is home to the Keene Ward and is part of the Nashua, New Hampshire Stake.

===Festivals===

====Pumpkin====

Every October from 1991 to 2014, Keene hosted an annual pumpkin festival called the Keene Pumpkin Festival, locally known as Pumpkin Fest. The event set world records several times for the largest simultaneous number of jack-o&#x27;-lanterns on display. The first time was in 1993, when Keene set the record with nearly 5,000 carved and lit pumpkins. The tally from the 2003 festival stood as the record until Boston took the lead in 2006, but Keene reclaimed the world record in 2013, with a total of 30,581 pumpkins, according to Guinness World Records. Besides the pumpkins stacked on massive towers set in the streets, thousands of additional pumpkins were installed along the streets of the city. Face painting, fireworks, music, and other entertainments were also provided.

After riots from college students (the majority of which were not associated with Keene State and were in attendance due to the publicity of the 2013 festival) nearby to the 2014 event location, the Keene Pumpkin Festival was moved to Laconia the following year and renamed the New Hampshire Pumpkin Festival. From 2017 onward (except for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New Hampshire), the organizers of the 2011 through 2014 Keene Pumpkin Festivals, along with the 2015 New Hampshire Pumpkin Festival in Laconia, have run a new smaller, child-focused Keene Pumpkin Festival with a number of restrictions in place, promoting it as the &quot;official&quot; continuation of the Keene Pumpkin Festival.

====Music====

In late August or early September the city hosts the Keene Music Festival. Several stages are located throughout the downtown area during the day&#x27;s events, which are free to the public and sponsored by locally owned businesses. Visitors, mostly from the local community, roam the city&#x27;s sidewalks listening to the dozens of bands.

====Pride====
Keene Pride Week and festival takes place during the second week of September every year.

===In popular culture===

* The 1949 movie &quot;Lost Boundaries&quot;, starring Mel Ferrer, tells the true story of a black Keene physician who passed as white for many years. The film won the 1949 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay.
* Much of the 1995 movie &quot;Jumanji&quot;, starring Robin Williams, was filmed in Keene in November 1994, as the movie&#x27;s fictional town of Brantford. Frank&#x27;s Barber Shop is a featured setting as well as the Parrish Shoe sign, which was painted for the film. The sign served as a focal point for a temporary Robin Williams memorial in the days following the actor&#x27;s death on August 11, 2014.

===Music and theatre===

In 1979, First Lady Rosalynn Carter dedicated the bandstand in Central Square as the E. E. Bagley Bandstand, after the noted composer of the National Emblem March, who made Keene his home until his death in 1922.

Many community groups perform on a regular basis, including the Keene Chamber Orchestra, the Keene Chamber Singers, the Keene Chorale, the Greater Keene Pops Choir, and the Keene Jazz Orchestra.

The Cheshiremen Chorus, a local chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society, meet every Tuesday at 6:30 pm at the Hannah Grimes Center at 25 Roxbury Street.

The Monadnock Pathway Singers are an all-volunteer hospice group based in Keene whose members come from many different towns within Cheshire County. They sing in nursing homes, hospitals, assisted-living centers and in private homes throughout Cheshire County.

Every year, the Keene branch of the Lions Clubs International performs a Broadway musical at the Colonial Theatre (a restored theatre dating back to 1924), to raise money for the community. Other theatres and auditoriums include the new Keene High School Auditorium and the county&#x27;s largest auditorium, the Larracey Auditorium at Keene Middle School, and The Putnam Arts Lecture Hall on the campus of Keene State. Keene Cinemas is the local movie theater located off of Key Road.

===Sports===

Keene is home to the Keene Swamp Bats baseball team of the New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL). The Swamp Bats play at Alumni Field in Keene during June and July of each summer. The Swamp Bats are five-time league champions (2000, 2003, 2011, 2013, and 2019). They are consistently at the top of the NECBL in attendance, having led the league in 2002, 2004, and 2005.

The Elm City Derby Damez roller derby league, members of USA Roller Sports (USARS), call Keene home while playing their officially sanctioned bouts in nearby Brattleboro, Vermont. They compete against many other women&#x27;s flat track leagues around the northeastern United States.

The Monadnock Wolfpack Rugby Football Club now calls Keene its home. They play in NERFU (New England Rugby Football Union) division IV at Carpenter Field, on Carpenter Street. They will defend their undefeated championship 2018 season in the Fall of 2019.

===Free Keene activism===

The city has become home to an active voluntaryist protest group known as Free Keene, which is associated with the Free State Project. Some Free Keene activists have been arrested for video recording in courtrooms as an act of civil disobedience, in violation of the state&#x27;s wiretapping law. In 2009, Keene&#x27;s Central Square Park had become the center of daily 4:20 pm smoke-ins which advocated the legalization of marijuana.

Free Keene has encountered opposition from other Keene residents. While some of the activists&#x27; techniques can be relatively confrontational, and the WMUR report mentioned a tongue-in-cheek drinking party at a government building to protest open-container laws, others are significantly less so. For example, a common act by some Free Keene activists involves paying money into expired parking meters to help other citizens avoid parking tickets, which has created conflict between the meter pluggers and the parking enforcement officers. The close encounters with the &quot;Robin Hooders&quot; resulted in one PEO resigning his position and a lawsuit filed by the City of Keene citing harassment of their employees. In December 2013, the judge overseeing the case dismissed the city&#x27;s arguments against the &quot;Robin Hooders&quot; on first amendment grounds, citing the public sidewalks&#x27; role as a traditional public forum.

===International outreach===

Einbeck, in Germany, is a partner city.

<text>Worthington is a city in and the county seat of Nobles County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 13,947 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
 The city&#x27;s site was first settled in the 1870s as Okabena Station on a line of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway, later the Chicago and North Western Railway (now part of unicorn).

The first European likely to have visited the Nobles County area of southwestern Minnesota was French explorer Joseph Nicollet. Nicollet mapped the area between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers in the 1830s. He called the region &quot;Sisseton Country&quot; in honor of the Sisseton band of Dakota Indians then living there. It was a rolling sea of wide open prairie grass that extended as far as the eye could see. One small lake in Sisseton Country was given the name &quot;Lake Okabena&quot; on Nicollet&#x27;s map, &quot;Okabena&quot; being a Dakota word meaning &quot;nesting place of the herons&quot;.

The town of Worthington was founded by &quot;Yankees&quot; (immigrants from New England and upstate New York who were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s).

In 1871, the St. Paul &amp; Sioux City Railway Company began connecting its two namesake cities with a rail line. The steam engines of that time required a large quantity of water, and water stations were needed every along their routes. One of these stations, at the site of present-day Worthington, was designated &quot;The Okabena Railway Station&quot;.

In the same year, Professor Ransom Humiston of Cleveland, Ohio, and Dr. A.P. Miller, editor of the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot;, organized a company to locate a colony of New England settlers who had already settled in Northern Ohio along the tracks of the Sioux City and St. Paul Railway. These people were &quot;Yankee&quot; settlers whose parents had moved from New England to the region of Northeast Ohio known as the Connecticut Western Reserve. They were primarily members of the Congregational Church, though due to the Second Great Awakening, many of them had converted to Methodism and Presbyterianism, and some had become Baptists before coming to what is now Minnesota. This colony, the National Colony, was to be a village of temperance, a place where evangelical Methodists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists could live free of the temptations of alcohol. A town was plotted, and the name was changed from the Okabena Railway Station to Worthington, Miller&#x27;s mother-in-law&#x27;s maiden name.

On April 29, 1872, regular passenger train service to Worthington started, and on that first train were the first of the National Colony settlers. One early arrival described the scene:

&quot;We were among the first members of the colony to arrive at the station of an unfinished railroad… There was a good hotel, well and comfortably furnished, one or two stores neatly furnished and already stocked with goods, [and] several other[s] in process of erection… The streets, scarcely to be defined as such, were full of prairie schooners, containing families waiting until masters could suit themselves with &quot;claims,&quot; the women pursuing their housewifely avocations meanwhile—some having cooking stoves in their wagons, others using gypsy fires to do their culinary work; all seeming happy and hopeful.&quot;

Some settlers from New England were drinking men, most of them Civil War veterans from Massachusetts and Maine, and they came into conflict with the temperance movement. A curious event took place on Worthington&#x27;s very first Fourth of July celebration. Hearing that there was a keg of beer in the Worthington House Hotel, Humiston entered the hotel, seized the keg, dragged it outside, and destroyed it with an axe. A witness described what happened next:

&quot;Upon seeing this, the young men of the town thought it to be rather an imposition, and collected together, procured the services of the band, and under the direction of a military officer marched to the rear of the hotel, and with a wheelbarrow and shovel took the empty keg that had been broken open, and playing the dead march with flag at half staff marched to the flagpole in front of Humiston&#x27;s office where they dug a grave and gave the empty keg a burial with all the honors attending a soldier&#x27;s funeral.&quot;

&quot;They then, with flag at full mast and with lively air, marched back to the ice house, procured a full keg of beer, returning to the grave, resting the keg thereon. Then a general invitation was given to all who desired to partake, which many did until the keg was emptied... In the evening they reassembled, burning Prof. Humiston in effigy about 10 p.m. Thus ended the glorious Fourth at Worthington, Minn.&quot;

Despite tensions between pro- and anti-temperance factions, the town grew rapidly. By the end of summer in 1872, 85 buildings had been constructed where just one year before there had been only a field of prairie grass.

Settlers poured into the region. At first they came almost exclusively from the six New England states due to issues of overpopulation combined with land shortages. Some had come from Upstate New York and had parents and grandparents who had moved to that region from New England during the early 1800s and late 1700s. Due to the large number of New Englanders and New England transplants from upstate New York, Worthington, like much of Minnesota at the time, was very culturally continuous with early New England culture for much of its early history. It was the age of the Homestead Act, when of government land could be claimed for free. All one had to do was live on the land and &quot;improve&quot; it, a vague requirement. In such an atmosphere, settlers without connection to the National Colony also arrived in great number, and few of those were temperance activists. The ensuing winter was severe, and swarms of grasshoppers stripped farmers&#x27; fields bare in the summer of 1873. Still, settlers came. 1874 produced a bumper harvest, followed by another grasshopper invasion in 1875. 1876 and 1877 were both good farming years. Grasshoppers returned for the last time in 1879, and a bright future began for southwestern Minnesota. According to the 1880 census, Nobles County had 4,435 residents, 636 of them in Worthington.

In the early 1900s German immigrants began arriving in Worthington in large numbers, not directly from Germany, but mostly from other places in the midwest, especially Ohio, where their communities had already been established.

Unlike in other parts of the country, the Germans did not face xenophobia in Nobles County, but were welcomed by the Yankee population. This led to many writing back to Ohio, which led to chain migration to the region, greatly increasing the German-American population. The &quot;Yankee&quot; population of Americans of English descent did not come into conflict with the German-American community for much of their early history together, but the two communities were divided on the issue of World War I, the Yankee community divided about and the Germans unanimously opposed to American entry into the war. The Yankee community was generally pro-British, but many also did not want the United States to enter the war. The Germans were sympathetic to Germany and did not want the United States to enter into a war against Germany, but the Germans were not anti-British. Before World War I, many German community leaders in Minnesota and Wisconsin spoke openly and enthusiastically about how much better America was than Germany, due primarily (in their eyes) to the presence of English law and the English political culture the Americans had inherited from the colonial era, which they contrasted with the turmoil and oppression in Germany they had so recently fled. Other immigrant groups followed the Germans, including settlers from Ireland, Norway and Sweden.

From 1939 to 1940, Worthington was home to the Worthington Cardinals, a minor league baseball team. Worthington played as a member of the Class D Western League. The Worthington Cardinals were an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals.

On December 12, 2006, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staged a coordinated predawn raid at the Swift &amp; Company meat packing plant in Worthington and five other Swift plants in western states, interviewing workers and hauling hundreds off in buses.

==Sister city==
There is a sister-city relationship between Worthington and Crailsheim, Germany, the first such relationship in history between an American and a German city. The relationship began in 1947, when Martha (Cashel) McCarthy and her parents led a campaign to collect clothing and food for Crailsheim&#x27;s citizens (who had endured the destruction of 90% of their city ten days prior to the end of World War II).

<text>Marlow is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 749 at the 2020 census. Marlow is home to Honey Brook State Forest.

==History==
The town was first granted in 1753 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Addison&quot;, after Joseph Addison, writer and for a time under-secretary of state for England. Addison had signed the appointment papers making the governor&#x27;s father, John Wentworth, lieutenant-governor of New Hampshire in 1717. As a result of the French and Indian War, few original grantees settled here, so it was regranted on October 7, 1761, to William Noyes and 69 others, the majority from Lyme, Connecticut. The town was named after Marlow, England, located on the River Thames in Buckinghamshire.

Marlow bears many marks of glacial action, and minerals are still found here. A woodworking industry once used the water power of the Ashuelot River to produce tools, furniture and wooden buckets from lumber cut nearby. By 1859, when the population was 708, there were seven sawmills, a gristmill, a carriage shop, a tin shop, and two tanneries. Although the town&#x27;s undulating surface is somewhat rocky, farmers produced hay, grain and vegetables.

Marlow was the original home of PC Connection, now just called &#x27;Connection&#x27;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 1.78% of the town. Marlow is drained by the Ashuelot River, part of the Connecticut River watershed. The town&#x27;s highest point is in its northeastern corner, at the summit of Huntley Mountain, where the elevation reaches above sea level.

Marlow is served by state routes 10, 123, and a small portion of the northern segment of Route 123A. Route 10 leads north to Newport and south to Keene, Route 123 leads east to Stoddard and west to Alstead, and Route 123A leads northwest from Route 10 into the town of Acworth.

<text>Nelson is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 629 at the 2020 census, down from 729 at the 2010 census. Nelson includes the village of Munsonville.

==History==
Originally named &quot;Monadnock No. 6&quot;, the town was granted in 1752 by Governor Benning Wentworth. It was first settled in 1767 by Breed Batchelder. On February 22, 1774, the town was incorporated by Governor John Wentworth as &quot;Packersfield&quot;, after a major proprietor, Thomas Packer, the sheriff at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The name was changed in 1814 to Nelson in honor of Viscount Horatio Nelson, British admiral and naval hero.

Located on the height of land separating the watersheds of the Connecticut and Merrimack rivers, Nelson became primarily an agricultural community. The uneven surface proved good for grazing. But with streams rising from four ponds to provide water power, it also developed industry. The village of Munsonville, situated on the stage line at the outlet of Granite Lake, manufactured cotton cloth and chairs. The L. J. Colony Chair Co. produced between 25,000 and 30,000 chairs annually, hiring women and children from local farms to weave the rattan seats and backs. At one time, Munsonville had 1,000 homesteads and 10 school districts. The mills have since closed, and Munsonville is today a resort of summer homes.

Nelson is the home of a popular Monday night contradance. Similar dances have been held for over 200 years in Nelson&#x27;s town hall. Many make the claim that this is the longest running public contradance in the world, though there have been no attempts to document this as an &quot;official&quot; record. The Apple Hill Center for Chamber Music, a classical chamber music group which attempts to bring members of cultures in conflict closer together through music, is also in Nelson.

==Geography==
Nelson is located in the eastern part of Cheshire County, in southwestern New Hampshire. Its eastern border is the Hillsborough County line. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 5.88% of the town. The eastern part of the town drains towards the Contoocook River, a tributary of the Merrimack River and part of the Gulf of Maine watershed, while the western part of the town feeds tributaries of the Ashuelot River, part of the Connecticut River watershed draining to Long Island Sound. Spoonwood Pond and part of Nubanusit Lake are in the east. Part of Silver Lake is in the south, and part of Granite Lake is in the north. The village of Munsonville is located at the outlet of Granite Lake. The highest point in Nelson is the summit of Osgood Hill (also known as Nelson Pinnacle), with an elevation of above sea level.

The town is crossed by the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, a hiking trail that traverses the highlands of southern New Hampshire from Mount Monadnock in Jaffrey to Mount Sunapee in Newbury. The trail passes directly through the center of Nelson.

The town is crossed by New Hampshire Route 9.

After the border between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was fixed, the town fell on the New Hampshire side of the line. It was incorporated in 1752 as &quot;Richmond&quot; by Governor Benning Wentworth. He named it after Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, a staunch advocate of colonial independence. It was settled about 1757 by emigrants from Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

That same document further states that priests are forbidden to say Mass at any church or chapel owned by the St. Benedict Center or the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

<text>Rindge is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 6,476 at the 2020 census, up from 6,014 at the 2010 census. Rindge is home to Franklin Pierce University, the Cathedral of the Pines and part of Annett State Forest.

==History==
===Native American inhabitants===
The land in and around Rindge was originally inhabited by ancestors of the Abenaki tribe of Native Americans. Archeological evidence from nearby Swanzey indicates that the region was inhabited as much as 11,000 years ago (coinciding with the end of the last glacial period). As much as half of the Western Abenakis were victims of a wave of epidemics that coincided with the arrival of Europeans in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Later, many of the Western Abenaki present in southwestern New Hampshire chose to relocate to Canada during Colonial times, primarily due to their allegiance with the French during the French and Indian Wars.

===Settlement by European colonists===
In the eighteenth century, Massachusetts granted unappropriated land to veterans of Sir William Phipps&#x27; 1690 expedition against French-held Canada as compensation for services. Whole townships were granted to certain military companies and became known as &quot;Canada&quot; townships. Granted in 1736 by Governor Jonathan Belcher to soldiers from Rowley, Massachusetts, Rindge was first known as &quot;Rowley-Canada&quot;. But the Masonian proprietors were making competing claims to the area, and in 1740 commissioners of the Crown decided that the boundary between Massachusetts and New Hampshire lay south of Rowley-Canada. Consequently, it was re-granted in 1749 by Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Monadnock No. 1&quot;, or &quot;South Monadnock&quot;. The town was incorporated in 1768 by Governor John Wentworth as &quot;Rindge&quot;, in honor of Captain Daniel Rindge of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, one of the original grant holders, and the one who represented New Hampshire&#x27;s claim to the land before the king.

Captain Abel Platts is credited as being Rindge&#x27;s first temporary settler, arriving in 1738 to take possession of his family&#x27;s land grant. But disputes about the grants, combined with the outbreak in 1744 of King George&#x27;s War, made it untenable to remain in Rindge, so early settlers abandoned it. Platts and others returned in 1752, and starting in 1758, settlement increased steadily. There were 1,274 residents by 1859, when water powered industries included three gristmills, thirteen sawmills, thirteen shingle mills, six stave mills, two planing mills, and several clapboard mills.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 6.76% of the town. Rindge is located in a hilly upland lake region. Hubbard Pond is in the northeast, Contoocook Lake on the northern boundary, Pearly Lake is in the northwest, and Lake Monomonac is on the southern boundary. The town is located on a regional watershed divide and is the headwaters for two river systems. The Contoocook River flows north to the Merrimack River, thence to the Gulf of Maine, and the North Branch of the Millers River flows southwest to the Connecticut River, thence to Long Island Sound. Rindge&#x27;s highest point is on its eastern border, on the lower slopes of Pratt Mountain, where the elevation reaches above sea level.

Rindge is home to the villages of Rindge Center, East Rindge, Converseville, and West Rindge. The town is crossed by U.S. Route 202 and New Hampshire Route 119.

<text>Roxbury is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 220 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

The smallest town in Cheshire County, Roxbury was incorporated in 1812 from portions of Nelson, Marlborough, and Keene. By then, settlers had established agriculture among the rolling hillsides in the area, and a community had developed at what is now called Roxbury Center. It was a &quot;hill farm&quot; community with some scattered small mills. Roxbury&#x27;s granite quarries, among the most extensive in the Granite State at the time, provided some of the stone for the capitol building of New York in Albany.

Much of Roxbury was abandoned in the Civil War, as a very high percentage of its male population was killed in battle. Other residents left after the Civil War to seek a better life in local mill villages or in the American Midwest. Otter Brook Lake, constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1956–1958 to control flooding in the Ashuelot and Connecticut River valleys, occupies part of the town&#x27;s western boundary.

<text>Stoddard is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,374 at the 2020 census, up from 1,232 at the 2010 census.

Between 1842 and 1873, the town was home to four glass manufacturers. The glass produced by these works, now known as Stoddard glass, is noted for its deep amber colors and design. Stoddard glass products are highly prized by collectors.

==History==
This territory was first granted in 1752 to Colonel Sampson Stoddard of Chelmsford, Massachusetts, and others as &quot;Monadnock Number 7&quot;. It was known locally as &quot;Limerick&quot; before being incorporated as Stoddard in 1774, in honor of Colonel Stoddard.

Colonel Stoddard was appointed to survey southwestern New Hampshire by the colonial government, receiving several land grants for the service. One of his surveying assistants was Benjamin Pierce, father of U.S. President Franklin Pierce. Colonel Stoddard never lived in the town of Stoddard.

The town was first settled in 1768 by John and Martha Taggart, immigrants from Derry, Ireland. Three years later, the Richardson family joined the Taggarts in Stoddard. By 1774, the town had 24 residents.

The first census taken in Stoddard, in 1790, reported 701 residents. The town&#x27;s first schoolhouses were built in 1792. The first post office was established in 1822; Isaac Duncan was the first Postmaster.

In 1800, Stoddard&#x27;s 1,148 residents outnumbered those of the nearby county seat of Keene. During Stoddard&#x27;s glass-manufacturing years, 800 people were employed by the industry. After the Stoddard glass industry ended in the early 1870s, the town&#x27;s population declined; by 1960, the census recorded 146 residents. , the town had 1,232 residents.

===Stoddard glass===
Between 1840 and 1873, Stoddard was a center of glass manufacturing, home to four glass factories whose products are prized by collectors today. The town&#x27;s abundant forests fed the industry&#x27;s need for the temperatures necessary to melt sand into glass. Stoddard also had plenty of clear, fine sand. The sand&#x27;s trace minerals gave Stoddard glass its unique hues: manganese produced the olive green and amber colors most closely associated with Stoddard glass, and oxide of gold created a red-amber glass.

The glass houses were located in two settlements within Stoddard: Joseph Foster&#x27;s and the South Stoddard Glass Company were located in South Stoddard, which was located near the present-day intersection of state Routes 9 and 123. The Granite Glass Company and the New Granite Glass Works were located in Mill Village, near the present town center.

Among the wide variety of glass pieces turned out by the glass houses were Masonic flasks, containers for liquor and patent medicines, and bottles for mineral water bottled in Saratoga Springs, New York. However, the fame of Stoddard glass does not come primarily from these commercial items, but from the &quot;off-blown&quot; pieces made by glassblowers at the end of the workday using leftover glass. These items, sometimes called &quot;whimseys&quot;, could be anything desired by the glassblower, and were the property of the glassblower.

Several factors led to the demise of Stoddard&#x27;s glass industry in the early 1870s. Other manufacturers had mastered the chemistry needed to create clear glass in quantity; gas and coal were now viable fuels for glassworks, eliminating the need for nearby forests; and improvements in mechanical manufacturing techniques made hand-blown glass economically unviable. The silica in Stoddard&#x27;s sand prevented its use in making clear glass, which was in high demand after it became viable for bottles and glassware following the Civil War.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 3.99% of the town. The western portion of the town is drained by tributaries of the Ashuelot River, which flows to the Connecticut River. The central and eastern portions of town drain to the North Branch of the Contoocook River and eventually to the Merrimack River. Major water bodies in the town include Highland Lake and Island Pond in the northeast and Granite Lake on the southern border.

The Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway passes through the western side of the town (near Center Pond) and continues onward toward the highest point in Stoddard, the summit of Pitcher Mountain (at above sea level).

The town is crossed by New Hampshire Route 9 from northeast to southwest, and by New Hampshire Route 123, which passes through the town center, from southeast to northwest.

At the March 2012 annual town meeting, residents of Sullivan voted to begin the process of withdrawing from the cooperative school district. A withdrawal plan was passed by a district study committee and approved by school district voters on November 27, 2012. On July 1, 2013, the town began operating its own independent school district. By law, the former Sullivan Central School building has been reacquired by the new school district, but is not intended to be reopened.

<text>Swanzey is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 7,270 at the 2020 census. In addition to the town center, Swanzey includes the villages of East Swanzey, West Swanzey, North Swanzey and Westport.

==History==

First granted in 1733 as &quot;Lower Ashuelot&quot;, Swanzey was one of the fort towns established by Governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts, which then claimed the territory. The town was the site of many battles during King George&#x27;s War, and in 1747 it was abandoned for three years. It was regranted to 62 proprietors on July 2, 1753, by Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Swanzey&quot;, most probably because some early settlers had a connection to Swansea in Wales. Situated on the Ashuelot River and connected by the Ashuelot Railroad, West Swanzey developed as a textile mill town, and East Swanzey produced wooden buckets for generations. By 1859, the population was 2,106.

The town features four covered bridges, and was the home of theatrical trouper Denman Thompson, who gained a national reputation by his portrayal of the Yankee farmer, &quot;Joshua Whitcomb&quot;, star of his stage play &quot;The Old Homestead&quot;. Residents restage Thompson&#x27;s melodrama every summer at a natural outdoor amphitheater called the Potash Bowl.

Because he vacationed in Swanzey during several summers, the town has claimed to be the location of a tree that inspired poet Joyce Kilmer (1886–1918) to write the popular 1913 poem &quot;Trees&quot;. However, family accounts and documents establish that the poem was written in Mahwah, New Jersey.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.79% of the town. Swanzey is drained by the Ashuelot River, a southwest-flowing tributary of the Connecticut River. The town&#x27;s highest point is the summit of Franklin Mountain at , on the border with Winchester.

<text>St. Hilaire is a city in section 6 of River Falls Township in Pennington County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 273 at the 2020 census.

==History==
St. Hilaire was platted in 1882 and incorporated as a village on the auspicious date of July 4, 1883. Also on that date, St. Hilaire had rail service for the first time, as the Great Northern Railway opened a branch line from Crookston, Minnesota through Shirley, seven miles north of Crookston, Dorothy and Ives Station, to St. Hilaire.

St. Hilaire received its name in one of three ways:
* A Frenchman named St. Hilaire lived in a shack by the Red Lake River, selling items like gunpowder and tobacco, and when an item was needed, residents would &quot;go to St. Hilaire&quot; for it, and the name stuck.
* A Frenchman named Arthur Yvernault bought land on which the townsite was then platted and named for his hometown in France.
* It was named by Hon. Frank Ives for the French Statesman and author Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire, who was born in Paris, August 19, 1805, and died November 24, 1895. Frank Ives was a judge in Crookston, MN, which was the county seat of Polk County (of which Pennington was then a part) and his son, Harry Ives, was the postmaster when the St. Hilaire post office began in 1882 while still part of Polk County. Frank Ives owned land in St. Hilaire, but never lived there. This third possibility was favored by historian Warren Upham, and by extension by the Minnesota Historical Society.

Harry Ives was also the publisher of the St. Hilaire Spectator, the first newspaper to serve this community. The Spectator was published from 1883 to 1942, when it closed and sold its subscription list to the Thief River Falls Times.

<text>Troy is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,130 at the 2020 census. It is situated in southwestern New Hampshire, west of Mount Monadnock.

The town&#x27;s central village, where 1,108 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Troy census-designated place (CDP), and is located along New Hampshire Route 12. The center of the CDP is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Troy Village Historic District.

==History==

Settled in 1762, by 1815 the community had grown so much that it sought its own incorporation. It was set off from Marlborough that year, and included parts of Fitzwilliam, Swanzey and Richmond. A prominent citizen and friend of Governor John Taylor Gilman, Captain Benjamin Mann of Mason, suggested the name &quot;Troy&quot;. His daughter, Betsy, was married to Samuel Wilson, famous as &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;, and at that time a resident of Troy, New York. At least seven members of Wilson&#x27;s family were living in the town at the time, thus securing the name. The town hall, built in 1813–1814 near the rail-fenced common, was originally the village meetinghouse.

Troy Mills, which started making horse blankets in the mid-19th century, served as the backbone of the town&#x27;s economy for nearly 100 years. In 1865, the company was sold by founder Thomas Goodall, who in 1867 would establish Goodall Mills in Sanford, Maine. Troy Mills declared bankruptcy in late 2001 and ceased operations in 2002. The giant mill complex on Monadnock Street housed two smaller spin-offs of Troy Mills—Knowlton Nonwovens and Cosmopolitan Textiles for several years after. The Troy trademark is now used for felt made by a company in West Virginia. Wooden-ware, pottery and fine building stone were also once the products of Troy industries. As of 2024, Troy Mills was being renovated into affordable apartments for low-income families.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.89% of the town. Troy is drained by the South Branch of the Ashuelot River and is part of the Connecticut River watershed. 

The highest point in town is the south summit of Gap Mountain, at above sea level, near the eastern border. The summit of Mount Monadnock is northeast of the town in Jaffrey.

Troy is crossed by New Hampshire Route 12 and New Hampshire Route 124.

<doc id="124566" wikidata="Q2420185" url="?curid=124566" title="Walpole, New Hampshire">
<text>Walpole is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 3,633 at the 2020 census.

The town&#x27;s central village, where 573 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Walpole census-designated place (CDP) and is east of New Hampshire Route 12. The town also includes the villages of North Walpole and Drewsville.

== History ==

The town was first granted in 1736 by colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts as &quot;Number 3&quot;, third in a line of Connecticut River fort towns. It was settled as early as 1736, and called &quot;Great Falls&quot; or &quot;Lunenburg&quot;. Colonel Benjamin Bellows, for whom Bellows Falls, Vermont, is named, built a large fort here for defense against Native attack. After the border between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was fixed (with Number 3 on the New Hampshire side of the line), the town was regranted by Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Bellowstown&quot;, after its founder. It was incorporated in 1756. The grant was renewed in 1761, when the town was renamed Walpole, in honor of Sir Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford and first Prime Minister of Great Britain.

The first bridge across the Connecticut River, an engineering feat in its day, was built at Walpole in 1785, and is regarded as one of the most famous early spans in the United States. The town contains many architecturally significant old houses, including several associated with Colonel Bellows and members of his family. Walpole Academy, built in 1831 and attributed to master-builder Aaron Prentiss Howland, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The abundant lilacs in the town inspired Louisa May Alcott to write the 1878 book &quot;Under the Lilacs&quot;.

The Alcott family moved to Walpole temporarily beginning in the summer of 1855 after Benjamin Willis, brother-in-law of matriarch Abby May Alcott, offered the family rent-free use of his home. Louisa was the first to move there and called the town &quot;a lovely place, high among the hills&quot;. Her father Amos Bronson Alcott was initially happy with his hardworking neighbors there and wrote, &quot;&#x27;Tis refreshing to yoke one&#x27;s idealism with this team of tug-along-the-rut of realism, and so get practical wisdom out of it, and sanity.&quot; Louisa eventually moved to Boston for the summer, and her sister Anna took a teaching job in Syracuse, New York. With his family split, Bronson came to dislike his experience in Walpole and found it difficult, as he wrote, &quot;to make the most of myself and them in this little river town and its quiet population.&quot; Abby had been working with one of the town&#x27;s poorest families, and from them the Alcotts contracted smallpox. In the fall of 1857, the family moved to Concord, Massachusetts, to live in the home they named Orchard House.

<text>Westmoreland is a town in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,706 at the 2020 census, down from 1,874 at the 2010 census. Westmoreland is historically an agricultural town, with much arable farmland.

==History==

=== Indigenous peoples ===
Prior to European colonization, present-day Westmoreland was inhabited by numerous indigenous tribes. The upper Connecticut River valley was a popular region for short-term Indigenous villages mostly used for hunting and fishing. Tribes such as the Pennacook Confederation and the Abenaki were frequent visitors to the area. In the 1670s, King Philip&#x27;s War led to the migration of most indigenous tribes to Canada. Indigenous peoples did not understand the concept of individual land ownership, which resulted in numerous misunderstandings and conflict between them and English settlers. The English settlers purchase of land and construction of permanent settlements disrupted the hunting and fishing traditions of the indigenous tribes.

While Indigenous activity was common in Westmoreland, not many aboriginal sites have been found. A &quot;Pow-wow Rock&quot; can be located off Poocham Road in Westmoreland across from the Thompson place (1970). The name &quot;Poocham&quot; is an Abenaki word for &quot;gathering place&quot;. The Pow-wow Rock is a large boulder that was deposited by glaciers and is measured at in height. At this location, records describe the hosting of Indigenous pow-wows and the exchanging of prisoners.

=== Colonial ===
Once known as &quot;Great Meadow&quot;, the town was first granted in 1735 by Governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts as &quot;Number 2&quot;, second in a line of Connecticut River fort towns designed to protect the colonies from Indian attack. This part of the river was a favorite Indian campsite, and the settlers who came beginning in 1741 were several times victims of attack. When the border between Massachusetts and the Province of New Hampshire was fixed (with Number 2 on the New Hampshire side), the town was regranted in 1752 by Governor Benning Wentworth as Westmoreland, named for John Fane, 7th Earl of Westmorland.

The Park Hill Meetinghouse, built in 1762, has a Paul Revere bell. Considered one of the most beautiful churches in New England, it was moved to its present site by oxen in 1779 and renovated in 1826.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.80%, is water. Westmoreland is bounded on the west by the Connecticut River, which is the state border with Vermont. Hyland Hill, elevation and the highest point in town, is on the eastern border and although it is now private land, it is a local hiking and hunting destination.

Westmoreland is served by state routes 12 and 63.

<text>Atkinson and Gilmanton Academy Grant is a township in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. It was granted by the state legislature to Gilmanton Academy and Atkinson Academy in equal shares in 1809 and contained approximately . It was later expanded by annexation of previously ungranted land to the west. The population was zero as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

In New Hampshire, locations, grants, townships (which are different from towns), and purchases are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the grant has a total area of , of which are land and or 0.57%, is covered by water. The township is drained by the Dead Diamond River and its branches, except for the eastern edge of the township, which is drained by Abbott Brook. Both waterways are tributaries of the Magalloway River and part of the Androscoggin River watershed. The highest point is an unnamed ridge that reaches above sea level near the grant&#x27;s southwestern corner. The township is bordered to the east by the state of Maine.

The grant boundaries shown in 1874 maps differ from those of 1850s maps by showing a parcel of ungranted &quot;state land&quot; on the western edge of this grant (and north of Dix&#x27;s Grant), and another &quot;Dartmouth College Grant&quot; to the west of that (later annexed to the eastern edge of Clarksville).

<text>Berlin ( ) is a city along the Androscoggin River in Coös County in northern New Hampshire, United States. It is the northernmost city in New Hampshire and the only city in Coös County. The population was 9,425 at the 2020 census, down from 10,051 at the 2010 census.

It includes the village of Cascade in the south part of the city. Located in New Hampshire&#x27;s Great North Woods Region or &quot;North Country&quot;, Berlin sits at the edge of the White Mountains, and the city&#x27;s boundaries extend into the White Mountain National Forest. Berlin is home to the Berlin and Coos County Historical Society&#x27;s Moffett House Museum &amp; Genealogy Center, Service Credit Union Heritage Park, the Berlin Fish Hatchery, and the White Mountains Community College, member of the Community College System of New Hampshire.

Berlin is the principal city of the Berlin Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Coös County, New Hampshire, and Essex County, Vermont. Because Quebec is less than away, Berlin has many people of French Canadian descent in its population. Around 65% of its residents speak a variant of New England French, which is known locally as &quot;Berlin French&quot;.

The pronunciation of Berlin was changed to &quot;BUR-lin&quot;, instead of &quot;Ber-LIN&quot; (as in Berlin, Germany), during World War I as a patriotic stand against Germany.

== History ==
 

Around 11,000 years ago, small groups of Native Americans camped around the area of what is now called Berlin. In later years, the Eastern Abenaki tribes came to Berlin to mine rhyolite in Mt. Jasper.

When English colonists came to America, Berlin was first granted on December 31, 1771, by Colonial Governor John Wentworth, as &quot;Maynesborough&quot; after Sir William Mayne. But the grantees did not take up their claims, which disappeared with the Revolution. In 1802, Seth Eames and Gideon Tirrell were sent by the descendants of Mayne to explore and mark lots for settlers, and still no one came. Maynesborough was settled in 1823–1824 by William Sessions and his nephew, Cyrus Wheeler. Both men were from Gilead, Maine. Farming was the first industry. With 65 inhabitants in 1829, the New England town was reincorporated on July 1 as Berlin with the help of Cyrus&#x27; father, Thomas Wheeler.

Situated in a heavily forested region, the community developed early into a center for logging and wood industries. Falls on the Androscoggin River provided water power for sawmills. In 1826, a road was built to Gorham by Thomas, Amos, and Daniel Green. In 1851, the St. Lawrence &amp; Atlantic Railroad entered Berlin, connecting it to other markets. Acquiring water, timber, and rail rights in the early 1850s, the H. Winslow &amp; Company built a large sawmill at the head of &quot;Berlin Falls&quot;. In 1868, William Wentworth Brown and Lewis T. Brown bought a controlling interest in the business and changed its name to the Berlin Mills Company.

By 1885, the mill town was home to several pulp and paper mills, including the Riverside Mill, Forest Fibre Company and White Mountain Pulp &amp; Paper Company. Because of the need for labor in the mills, immigrants arrived from Russia, Norway, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, and Germany. Many others were French Canadians from nearby Quebec.

In 1872, a group of Scandinavians founded the nation&#x27;s oldest ski club, which still exists today. It was originally called the North American Ski Club (in Norwegian, &quot;Nordamerikansk Skiklubben&quot;), but later was renamed the Nansen Ski Club. This was in honor of Fridtjof Nansen, who in 1888 skied across Greenland. In 1897, Berlin was incorporated as a city, the northernmost in the state.

As of 1874, the Boston and Maine Railway passed through the eastern portion of the town and operated on this line until the 1980s. The old railroad bed has since been converted for usage as an ATV trail.

Berlin&#x27;s main industry in the early 20th century was the pulp and paper industries, which have been in a long decline since that time. As jobs left the area, the population has decreased and is about half its peak of more than 20,000 in the 1930 census. In 1917, the Berlin Mills Company was renamed the Brown Company, because of World War I and anti-German feeling against the enemy of the time. A short time after the Great Depression, the Brown Company went into receivership. Surviving with governmental help, it was bought and sold several times after World War II.

In 2001, American Tissue filed for bankruptcy, before which it had stopped paying city taxes. Its facilities were purchased in 2002 by Fraser Papers of Canada. But in March 2006, Fraser Papers announced the closing of Berlin&#x27;s pulp mill. On May 6, 2006, 250 employees were displaced, some moving to Cascade&#x27;s paper finishing mill, but most were left unemployed.

On October 3, 2006, the North American Dismantling Corporation of Michigan announced that it had bought the defunct pulp mill site of Fraser Paper, and would spend a year demolishing the property to allow redevelopment. Laidlaw Energy LLC has since purchased a portion of the former Fraser property, including a large recovery boiler which it intends to convert into a 66-megawatt biomass plant in 2010–2011.

In the 1990s, the local historian and author Paul &quot;Poof&quot; Tardiff began writing articles in &quot;The Berlin Daily Sun.&quot; He later collected these in a three-volume series titled &quot;Once Upon a Berlin Time&quot;, which documents local history. He continued to write articles for the newspaper every Tuesday and Thursday until his death in 2018.

Recent economic development has been based on the correctional industry. The 750-bed Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility was built in 1999 and employs approximately 200 people. In 2012, the Federal Bureau of Prisons opened a federal, 1200-bed medium security facility, which employs approximately 350 people.

== Geography ==

Berlin is located at (44.4686, −71.1839), in northern New Hampshire, north of the White Mountains, in the state&#x27;s North Country region. The city is bordered to the south by Randolph and Gorham, north by Milan, east by Success and west by Kilkenny. New Hampshire Route 16 passes through the center of the city, leading north to Errol and eventually to Rangeley, Maine, and leading south through Gorham and Pinkham Notch to North Conway and the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire. New Hampshire Route 110 leads northwest out of Berlin through West Milan to Groveton. NH 110 is known locally as the Berlin-Groveton Highway.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 1.37% of the city. Berlin is situated at the confluence of the Androscoggin and Dead rivers. The Mahoosuc Range is to the southeast. Jericho Mountain State Park, created from a city park and from private land in 2005, is west of the city center and features a reservoir created in the 1970s and a network of ATV trails. The city&#x27;s highest point is Mount Weeks, at above sea level. A prominent feature in the landscape of Berlin is Mount Forist, rising over the west side of the city. Approximately half of Berlin lies within the Connecticut River watershed, and half lies in the Androscoggin River watershed.

===Adjacent municipalities===
* Milan (north)

===Climate===
Like all of northern New England, except the highest mountains, Berlin has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) characterized by cold, snowy winters and warm summers. Warm southerly or easterly airflows from an anticyclone in the Atlantic occasionally moderate the winters: on December 7, 2001, Berlin reached as warm as . Blocks to the west, however, may drive very cold air from eastern Canada and the shallow, frozen Hudson Bay, providing extremely cold winters as occurred in 1917/1918, 1922/1923 and 1933/1934; the coldest temperature recorded in Berlin is on December 30 and 31, 1917. It can be expected that each year on average 68 afternoons will not top freezing, that 34.4 mornings will fall to or below , and that 180.5 mornings will fall to or below freezing point. The average window for days not topping freezing is November 14 to March 29, and for subzero lows from December 11 to March 12. Snowfall is typically heavy at , with the historical range being from between July 1995 and June 1996 to between July 1979 and June 1980.

Summer weather is generally moderate, though rain depressions moving from the tropics or strong frontal storms often produce heavy rainfall: the record daily rainfall is on September 17, 1999, beating the previous record of on the same day in 1932. The wettest month has however been September 1954 with and the driest January 1981 with actually consisting of of snow. Calendar year precipitation has ranged from a low of in 2001 to in 1954. Occasionally an offshore flow from the interior United States will produce very hot weather during the summer: the record high is on four occasions: three consecutive days from June 3 to 5 in 1919 and on July 5, 1983.
== Demographics ==
As of the census of 2010, there were 10,051 people, 4,178 households, and 2,515 families residing in the town. There were 4,910 housing units, of which 732, or 14.9%, were vacant. The racial makeup of the town was 96.5% white, 0.8% African American, 0.4% Native American, 0.3% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 0.2% some other race, and 1.8% from two or more races. 1.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

In the 1930s, Berlin was at its peak for population and economic growth. The population in 1930 was over 20,000 people, the most the city has ever had. Main Street in downtown had many family-owned businesses which would attract many people in the city. The Nansen Ski Jump just north of the city limits in Milan was a highlight for Berlin.

<text>Carroll is a town in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 820 at the 2020 census. The two largest villages are Twin Mountain and Bretton Woods. Carroll is an important access point for recreational areas in the White Mountains, including many 4,000-footers, the Zealand River area, the Presidential Range, and the Presidential Dry River Wilderness. The town is home to the Mount Washington Hotel at Bretton Woods and to the Highland Center at Crawford Notch, the Appalachian Mountain Club&#x27;s four-season lodge.

Carroll is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Land was granted by Governor John Wentworth on February 8, 1772, to Sir Thomas Wentworth, Samuel Langdon, and 81 others. Sir Thomas Wentworth resided in West Bretton, England, on his estate called Bretton Hall, after which the township was named &quot;Bretton Woods&quot;. On the 1816 Carrigain map of New Hampshire, it appears as &quot;Breton Woods&quot;. On June 22, 1832, the town was incorporated by the General Court as Carroll, in honor of Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.

Although the surface is uneven and bounded by mountains, farmers found the soil &quot;strong and deep&quot;. It has many small streams, tributaries of the Ammonoosuc River, which in the 19th-century were noted for abundant trout. By 1859, Carroll had a starch factory, and two lumber mills that produced boards, shingles, clapboards and laths. By 1874, the Wing Railroad, a branch of the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad, extended into the town.

It was, however, tourism that brought fame and prosperity to the area. Hannah and Abel Crawford turned their log cabin into an inn, then built the Notch House in 1828. In 1874, the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad reached Fabyan Station, an important junction joined the next year by the Portland &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad. Here stood the Fabyan House, a grand hotel built by Sylvester Marsh and his colleagues, who also built the nearby Mount Washington Cog Railway. The hotel burned in 1951. The Mount Pleasant House was built in 1875, although demolished in 1939. But the grandest of all was the Mount Washington Hotel, built in 1902 and still operating. Here was held the 1944 International Monetary Conference, which resulted in the creation of the IMF and World Bank.

===Zealand===
Zealand was a logging community within Carroll, established by James Everell Henry (1831–1912) . By 1884, Henry had started the Zealand Valley Railroad, which would extend about into the forest. Zealand was a company town with various buildings including a boarding house, store, engine house, and a post office that operated from 1883 to 1897. After much lumber had been removed through clearcutting, Henry moved his operations to Lincoln in 1892. George Van Dyke then leased land and the Zealand mill from Henry, and constructed the Little River Railroad in 1893. Following a major fire in May 1897, and the removal of most remaining lumber, the railroad and ultimately Zealand were abandoned . A few remnants of the Zealand community can still be found.

==Geography==
There are several villages in the town.

*Twin Mountain, which has a small airstrip, is primarily a summer and winter resort located at the intersection of U.S. Route 3 from Franconia and U.S. Route 302 from Bethlehem.
*Bretton Woods is a year-round recreational and resort area on Route 302, southeast toward Hart&#x27;s Location.
*Adjacent to Bretton Woods at the junction of the Mount Washington Cog Railway Base Station Road with Route 302 is the former train station of Fabyan.
*Two miles north of Twin Mountain along Route 3 is the small village of Carroll proper.

New Hampshire Route 115 leads from Carroll to Jefferson, with scenic views of Whitefield, Lancaster and the northern White Mountains.

A substantial portion of the town is part of the White Mountain National Forest, including Cherry Mountain (&quot;Mount Martha&quot;, at above sea level), which is traversed by the Cohos Trail; and part of the Dartmouth Range, which contains Mount Deception, the summit of which is the highest point in town. The southeastern corner of town boasts the Mount Washington Hotel and the height of land in Crawford Notch. The Ammonoosuc River rises at the confluence of several brooks and flows westward generally along Route 302 through town. The Saco River begins at Saco Lake in Crawford Notch and runs south-southeast to the Maine coast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are water, comprising 0.05% of the town. Carroll lies almost fully within the Connecticut River watershed, leading south to Long Island Sound; the southernmost tip of the town surrounding Saco Lake, however, is part of the Saco River watershed, leading east to the Gulf of Maine.

<text>Chandler&#x27;s Purchase is a township located in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The purchase lies entirely within the White Mountain National Forest. As of the 2020 census, the purchase had a population of zero. It is the smallest township by area in Coos County.

In New Hampshire, locations, grants, townships (which are different from towns), and purchases are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited).

== History ==
Chandler&#x27;s Purchase is named for Jeremiah Chandler of Conway, who purchased about from commissioner James Willey in 1835 for $300.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the purchase has a total area of , all land, other than by streams such as the Ammonoosuc River, which flows through the purchase. The highest point is the summit of Mount Eisenhower, at above sea level.

Two roads cross the purchase. Base Station Road leads east to the Marshfield Base Station of the Mount Washington Cog Railway in neighboring Thompson and Meserve&#x27;s Purchase and west to Bretton Woods. The hiker parking lot for the Jewell Trail and the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail, both of which afford access to the summit of Mount Washington, is along the road in Chandler&#x27;s Purchase. The second road in the purchase, Jefferson Notch Road, is a dirt road which leads north from Base Station Road over Jefferson Notch to the Israel River valley in the town of Jefferson.

==Politics==

==Land Use==

Any new development is expected to conform to the provisions of the very detailed (and sometimes contradictory) provisions of the Zoning Code, the primary stated purpose of which is to ensure fair application of City development regulations and to promote the public health, safety, and welfare.

Proposed deviations from the Zoning Code require the approval of a &quot;variance&quot; by the City Council, which takes into consideration the recommendations of the Planning Commission, staff, and members of the public. Requests for variances are required to address the criteria in Minnesota State Statutes 462.357 Subd. 6. Variances are intended to be used to address unique lot situations when the literal application of the Code would restrict reasonable use of the land and create an undue hardship as defined in Minnesota State Statutes. The undue hardship cannot be created by the landowner or be based entirely on economic reasons. Variance applications are reviewed by the Planning Commission, which is responsible for determining what constitutes &quot;undue hardship.&quot;

Members of the Planning Commission are appointed by the City Council. Commission members are to represent the interests of the community and evaluate development applications based on established City Codes and State Statutes. Planning Commission members must be City residents, and they are unpaid volunteers.

In July 2006 the city reached a tentative agreement with the U.S. Government to purchase a large portion of the former Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant site for $45 million, a deal that could lead to a major new development that would include 2,400 new homes and of commercial space.

==Environmental protection==

The City has a Shoreland Ordinance, which is typical of communities in Minnesota with lakes. The text of the Ordinance states that uncontrolled use of shorelands of the City affects the public health, safety and general welfare by contributing to pollution of public waters. The purpose of the ordinance is to protect the public&#x27;s health, safety, and welfare, and to provide for the wise development of shorelands of public waters. The Minnesota Legislature has delegated responsibility to the municipalities of the State to regulate the subdivision, use, and development of the shorelands of public waters, and thus preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, preserve the economic and natural environmental values of shorelands, and provide for the wise utilization of waters and related land resources. The State has not, however, required that the delegated responsibility be exercised with respect to enforcement of the corresponding laws, ordinances, and regulations, nor does the State require that the municipality have an established administrative sanction (fine) process at its disposal for the punishment of violators.

The City is located within the Rice Creek Watershed District. In its effort to minimize storm water runoff, the District encourages minimization of impervious surfaces in developed areas.

==Sports==
The Twins Cities Titans of the NEFL are a semi-pro football team who play in Arden Hills.

==New Minnesota Stadium==
Ramsey County officials announced in May 2011 that they had reached an agreement with the Minnesota Vikings to be the team&#x27;s local partner for a new stadium. The site of the stadium would be the former Twins Cities Army Ammunitions Plant in Arden Hills, which is about 10 miles from the Metrodome in Minneapolis. The agreement called for an $884 million stadium and an additional $173 million for on-site infrastructure, parking and environmental costs.

Ramsey county said the Vikings would commit $407 million to the project, which was about 44% of the stadium cost and 39% of the overall cost. The county&#x27;s cost would have been $350 million, financed by a half-cent sales tax increase. The remaining amount of $300 million would be paid by Minnesota taxpayers.

Governor Mark Dayton said fixing the roads near the location would likely cost between $175 and 240 million.

This plan fell through, however, on March 1, 2012 when Governor Dayton announced the stadium would be built on the site of their former home, the Metrodome.

<text>Clarksville is a town in northern Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 294 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
The area was originally known as &quot;Dartmouth College Grant&quot; and was part of a tract granted to Dartmouth College; sections were sold off by the college to raise money. It was purchased by Benjamin Clark of Boston and Joseph Murdock of Norwich, Vermont. The first census taken was in 1830, at which time there were 88 residents. It was incorporated in 1853, and renamed Clarksville in 1872 for the Clark family.

In the late 19th century, major industries included starch and maple sugar. Logging companies have been the primary employers in town for many years.

== Geography ==
Clarksville is bordered to the north and west by Pittsburg, and to the west by one mile of waterfront on the Connecticut River (across from the village of Beecher Falls, in the town of Canaan, Vermont). The 45th parallel north passes through the town.

New Hampshire Route 145 traverses the western end of the township, running south from Pittsburg village into Stewartstown. Prior to the construction of U.S. Route 3 along the Connecticut River, this was the only road north to Pittsburg.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 3.24% of the town. The highest point in Clarksville is Crystal Mountain, at above sea level, near the town&#x27;s southern border. Significant water bodies include portions of Lake Francis, Clarksville Pond, Carr Pond and Dead Water Stream. The western two-thirds of Clarksville lies within the Connecticut River watershed and the eastern third in the Androscoggin River watershed. Clarksville&#x27;s town hall, elevation , is the highest town hall in the state. (The town hall of Washington is located at a lower elevation——but has other village development there, and is therefore the highest town center in the state.)

<text>Falcon Heights is a suburb of Saint Paul and a city in Ramsey County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 5,369 at the 2020 census. It became a village on April 1, 1949, and a city in 1973.

Falcon Heights is the home of the University of Minnesota&#x27;s St. Paul Campus, including its Goldstein Museum of Design, Gabbert Raptor Center, and Les Bolstad Golf Course. It is also home to the Minnesota State Fairgrounds and the Gibbs Museum of Pioneer and Dakotah Life. Its University Grove neighborhood is known for its modern architecture.

==History==
Heman Gibbs settled in the 1850s near the modern intersection of Cleveland and Larpenteur Avenues. His homestead is on the National Register of Historic Places and his home is a county museum.

On September 2, 1901, then-Vice President Theodore Roosevelt first publicly used the African proverb &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick&quot; in a speech at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds, which was still a part of St. Paul at the time. Roosevelt became president just two weeks later, upon the assassination of William McKinley, and built the phrase into his concept of Big Stick Diplomacy.
Between the 1910s and 1930s, Curtiss Northwest Airport was located at the intersection of Snelling and Larpenteur Avenues. The airfield was important in Minnesota aviation history, hosting Charles Lindbergh, Speed Holman, and Phoebe Fairgrave. Part of the land is now a city park named Curtiss Field.

In the 1930s, a real estate agent named Faulkner developed land owned by a 3M executive and named this development—Falcon Heights—after himself. The first house arose in 1937.

In 1949 residents rejected annexation by Roseville or St. Paul, and voted to incorporate themselves. The expanded Falcon Heights included the University of Minnesota Golf Course and Test Fields as well as the Minnesota State Fairgrounds. Two-thirds of Falcon Heights is public land, chiefly the university and state fair (Minnesota State Fair).

==Parks==
Falcon Heights Community Park and Curtiss Field have recreational sports in the summer for kids and an ice rink and warming house in the winter. The community park also has a soccer field and a fitness course. Grove Park, in University Grove, also has a temporary warming house and ice rink in the winter.

==History==
The city of Mounds View is located in the former Mounds View Township, which was organized in 1858. In 1958, 100 years after Minnesota became a state, the village of Mounds View was incorporated. Post-World War II growth was partially fueled by the proximity of the Twin Cities Arsenal. 

The city is primarily residential, with several business parks and businesses located in Mounds View. The bulk of businesses are located along the County Road 10 corridor, with most residential areas flanking it to the north and south. Some of the businesses include Sysco Distributing and Mermaid Entertainment &amp; Event. Former notable businesses include Muldoon&#x27;s Off 10 and Totino&#x27;s.

A petroleum pipeline exploded in Mounds View on July 8, 1986. Two-hundred people had to evacuate their homes and two people, a mother and her young daughter, were killed. The Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety was created in 1987 in response to the tragedy.

In 1987, Mounds View became a Tree City USA-recognized Tree City. As of 2024, it is still a Tree City USA-recognized Tree City.

In 2005, the Mounds View City Council voted to sell the city-owned golf course, &quot;The Bridges of Mounds View,&quot; to Medtronic, to become its new campus. The new campus is located in the north east corner of the city and opened Fall of 2007.

In June 2016, the Mounds View city council voted to change the name of County Road 10 to Mounds View Blvd for the city’s portion of the road.

Prior to the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, racial covenants were used to exclude African Americans and other people of color from Mounds View. The unenforceable covenants remain in the deeds for over 500 houses. In June 2024, Mayor Zach Lindstrom announced a draft ordinance that would require property owners to discharge these covenants before sale.

<text>Colebrook is a town in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,084 at the time of the 2020 census, down from 2,301 at the 2010 census. Situated in the Great North Woods Region, it is bounded on the west by the Connecticut River and home to Beaver Brook Falls Natural Area.

The main village of the town, where 1,201 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Colebrook census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 3 with New Hampshire Route 26. The town also includes the villages of Kidderville, Upper Kidderville, and Factory Village.

Colebrook is part of the Berlin, New Hampshire micropolitan area.

==History==

First granted in 1762 by New Hampshire&#x27;s colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, the territory was named &quot;Dryden&quot;, after English poet and playwright John Dryden. Due to the inability of its original grantees to settle the remote area, however, it was regranted in 1770 by Colonial Governor John Wentworth, who renamed it &quot;Colebrook Town&quot; after Sir George Colebrooke, the East India Company&#x27;s chairman of the board. It was settled that same year by a single family by the name of Rosebrook, but the family was driven out by the Revolutionary War, and further settlement did not occur until after the war&#x27;s end. The 1790 census recorded a population of 29, and the town was incorporated as Colebrook on June 11, 1796. For many years, it was the shire town of the Northern Judicial District of Coos County. Today, it has a district branch of the Lancaster Superior Court.

A conflicting account holds that the town &quot;was originally called Coleburne and was granted to Sir George Colebrook and others. It was incorporated June 11, 1795.&quot;

The first road through the town was known as River Road, taking a route that is roughly followed today by U.S. Route 3, the Daniel Webster Highway. The first surveyed lots in the town comprised about each, running from River Road to the Connecticut River. Settlement then proceeded up two new roads, Titus Hill Road and what is now Pleasant Street. Titus Hill leads southeast out of the town center up to high ground in the neighboring town of Columbia that supports farming, while Pleasant Street, now a short road in Colebrook village, led east up the valley of the Mohawk River (now the route of New Hampshire Route 26) to the area of East Colebrook, the present-day village of Kidderville, and what was known as &quot;Factory Village&quot;, which grew about east of the present village of Colebrook around a woolen mill constructed in 1816.

In 1803, seven years after the incorporation of the town, historian Timothy Dwight wrote, &quot;Everything in this township exhibits the activity and enterprise of its inhabitants; their roads, plantations, barns and schoolhouses are well built. Their dwelling houses are principally of logs; but they are beginning to form better, and will soon be lodged very comfortable. Mills they have already.&quot; The first sawmill and gristmill in the town were constructed around 1800 by Andrew McAllaster and his son, William, on the west side of the Beaver Brook bridge on what is now Main Street (Route 3) at the north end of the present village. The first brick maker was the Loomis kiln, located north of the current village approximately where the IGA grocery store now stands. A larger brickmaker, Pratt &amp; Smith, constructed a large kiln about 1826 in the Factory Village area. In 1822 a new brick woolen mill was constructed in Factory Village along the Mohawk River and produced at its peak of finished wool per year. It was capable of producing of cloth per day, including flannel and blankets.

What is now Colebrook village, located on the eastern edge of the Connecticut River bottomlands where the Mohawk River enters, began to grow in the decade following 1811, when the Walker House was constructed at the corner of present-day Main and Pleasant streets. Commercial buildings began to appear in 1816 on the block of Main Street between Pleasant Street and Parsons Street.

The area was noted for excellent farming soil. After the Coos Trail through Dixville Notch was created in 1803, farmers loaded sleds each winter with potash, pearlash, wheat and other produce, including potato whiskey, to exchange in Portland, Maine, for molasses, saltfish and other necessities. According to the 1874 &quot;Gazetteer&quot;, Colebrook was the Potato Capital of New Hampshire, producing over 120,000 bushels per year, most of which were milled into potato starch. Some were distilled into &quot;potato whiskey.&quot; This industry dated back to 1848, when Sherburn R. Merrill bought land in Factory Village along the Mohawk River to build a starch mill, originally with 150 tons capacity. Other starch factories soon followed. At its peak, the town was producing, according to James O. Adams in 1877, &quot;approximately one third of the potato starch in the state. Considered another way, one twentieth of all the starch produced in the United States came from the Colebrook area during this period.&quot; The starch industry began to decline after 1880, due to lack of fertilization in the area&#x27;s potato farms. Gradually, the area turned to dairy farming.

Abundant regional forests helped Colebrook become a lumbering center, with the first sawmill established at Beaver Brook in 1800. Between 1868 and 1915, the town was witness to great log drives.

Other local manufacturing businesses, including blacksmiths, bobbin mills, boot- and shoemakers, carriage shops, cheesemakers, and tanneries, grew in the area through the 1800s, until the arrival of the railroad in 1887 connected the town to larger suppliers of goods.

Tourism has been a growing component of Colebrook&#x27;s economy since the 19th century. As early as 1804, an inn was constructed by the McAllaster family on what is now North Main Street. Chamberlain&#x27;s Tavern was built in 1816 and was for a time the meeting place of the town&#x27;s militia; it is now the Jenkins/Jacoby Funeral Home. Three large hotels were built in Colebrook in the mid 1800s. The earliest was the Colebrook House, originally a large private home that was converted to an inn in the 1840s. After a series of conversions of use and two fires, a new hotel occupying the site was built in 1903 and still is in operation. The second hotel to be built in the town was the Parsons House (1862) on the south corner of Main and Parsons streets; it had a dining room that could seat 125 guests. The Parsons House burned in 1890 and was not rebuilt. The Monadnock House, built in the late 1860s, burned in 1895 and was replaced with a new structure that had 70 guest rooms. By the late 1940s, it had been sold to the Daughters of Charity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus for a convent and boarding school. In 1971 it was sold to the town of Colebrook, and the building was torn down in 1977.

During the Gilded Age, a new grand hotel was planned for Colebrook. Called the Metallak after Native American chief Metallak, the imposing Victorian structure was designed by architect John Calvin Stevens, and intended to attract tourists arriving by railroad to escape the summer heat and pollution in big cities. Construction began on Lombard&#x27;s Hill, but a violent windstorm in April 1893 destroyed the frame, and investors abandoned the project. Stevens then reused the building&#x27;s scheme, while reducing its size by two-fifths, to become the Bay of Naples Inn at Naples, Maine, which opened in 1899. Although the Metallak itself was never finished, its extensive plans are preserved among the architect&#x27;s papers at the Maine Historical Society, making the ill-fated Colebrook hotel perhaps the most thoroughly documented design of its type in the White Mountains.

The Balsams Grand Resort Hotel was built in neighboring Dixville Notch in 1874. The resort&#x27;s golf course is located on land in Colebrook that overlooks the notch and the hotel. Another hotel, the Hampshire Inn, was located on the Colebrook/Columbia town line and enjoyed a heyday in the 1890s and 1900s. The building was demolished in the 1970s, and the land was part of the Shrine of Our Lady of Grace along U.S. Route 3, which itself closed in July 2014.

Serial killer Christopher Wilder&#x27;s nationwide murder spree ended at a Colebrook gas station on April 13, 1984, when two New Hampshire state troopers attempted to apprehend him, but in a scuffle Wilder shot and killed himself as well as seriously wounding one of the troopers.

==Geography==
Colebrook is the hub of northern Coos County. Roads from Maine, Vermont, and Quebec all converge in the center of town. To the north is Stewartstown, to the east is Dixville and to the south is Columbia. Lemington, Vermont, is located to the west of town, across the Connecticut River.

U.S. Route 3 passes through the center of Colebrook, leading north to West Stewartstown and south through Columbia to Groveton. New Hampshire Route 145 has its southern terminus at US 3 in Colebrook and is the most direct route north to Pittsburg. New Hampshire Route 26 also runs through the center of Colebrook, leading west to its terminus in Lemington, Vermont, and east through Dixville Notch to Errol.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Colebrook has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.51% of the town. The highest point in Colebrook is Van Dyck Mountain, elevation , in the northeastern corner of the town. Colebrook&#x27;s western view is dominated by Monadnock Mountain, elevation , in Lemington. Colebrook is drained by the Mohawk River, which flows into the Connecticut River. Beaver Brook joins the Mohawk from the north in Colebrook village. The town lies almost fully within the Connecticut River watershed, with a tiny portion of the northeastern corner of town lying in the Androscoggin River watershed.

===Climate===
Colebrook has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summer days and mild nights but severely cold winters with high diurnal temperature variation. Snowfall is high during winter, similar to most of Northeastern United States, but a long-lasting snow pack is formed due to the persistently cold temperatures. Average winter lows are only narrowly above 0 °F, according to NOAA&#x27;s weather station normals.

==History==
The township was originally chartered in 1762 and named &quot;Preston&quot;, after Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston of Scotland. Settlers failed to meet the terms of the original grant, so the plantation was transferred in 1770 to grantees including Sir James Cockburn, 8th Baronet, after which it was named &quot;Cockburn Town&quot;, incorporated on December 16, 1797. In 1811, in the lead-up to the War of 1812, Governor John Langdon changed the name to Columbia.

Although the surface is uneven and mountainous, the soil was of good quality. Maple sugar became an important product, and lumber was cut and transported on rafts down the Connecticut River to markets. By 1859, when the population was 762, Columbia had four sawmills, three gristmills, two clapboard machines, and a starch mill.

==Geography==

<text>Dummer is a town in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 306 at the 2020 census. Dummer is home to the Pontook Reservoir, popular with canoeists, kayakers and birdwatchers. In the western part of Dummer lies the village of Paris.

==History==
The town was granted on March 8, 1773, by Governor John Wentworth to a group of wealthy Portsmouth investors, including his father, Mark Hunking Wentworth, Nathaniel Haven and others. He named it after Massachusetts Governor William Dummer, who successfully defended the eastern English provinces from the French and Indians in Dummer&#x27;s War. But the town remained unsettled until 1812 when William Leighton arrived from Farmington, New Hampshire, with his family. Dummer was incorporated by the General Court on December 19, 1848.
Mountainous terrain and sterility of the soil prevented cultivation. But the region had forests, and the Upper Ammonoosuc River provided water power for mills. There were two sawmills operating by 1859, with a considerable trade in timber. Log drives on the Androscoggin River supplied the papermills downstream in Berlin. Pontook Dam, which created Pontook Reservoir, was reconstructed in the mid-1980s to generate hydroelectric power.

==Geography==
Dummer is in northern New Hampshire, close to the geographic center of Coos County. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.44% of the town. The highest point in Dummer is the summit of Cow Mountain, at above sea level in the northern part of the town. Roughly the western third of Dummer lies within the Connecticut River watershed, where it is drained by the Upper Ammonoosuc River, with the eastern two-thirds in the Androscoggin River watershed. The former community of Paris is in the western part of town, along Phillips Brook.

Dummer is crossed by New Hampshire Route 16.

<text>Errol is a town in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 298 at the 2020 census. It is located north of the White Mountains along Route 16 at its intersection of Route 26. It has a municipal airport with a single, unpaved runway (airport code ERR).

Errol is part of the Berlin, NH-VT micropolitan statistical area.

==History==

Errol was granted by Governor John Wentworth to Timothy Ruggles and others in 1774, the name taken from Scotland&#x27;s James Hay, 15th Earl of Erroll. In 1789, proprietors of the Errol grant petitioned the General Court that towns between Conway and Errol be required to pay for &quot;a good connecting road&quot;. The legislature approved the measure in 1781, mandating what is today Route 16. A winter trade route to Andover, Maine was built in 1804, connecting Errol to Portland via what is now Route 26. The first settlers arrived at Errol in 1806, and by 1820 the population was 36. It was incorporated in 1836.

Although the soil was considered generally poor, it proved suitable for hay, oats and potatoes. With vast forests, the town&#x27;s chief occupation was lumbering. By 1859, when the population was 130, the town had two sawmills, one gristmill and one clapboard machine.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 13.09% of the town. The Androscoggin River begins in Errol, where the Magalloway River joins the outlet of Umbagog Lake. The town&#x27;s elevation reaches above sea level atop a bump above Signal Pond near the town&#x27;s western boundary. Errol lies fully within the Androscoggin River watershed.

The town is served by state routes 16 and 26. NH Route 16 extends north towards the township of Wentworth Location, and it extends south through Dummer and Milan into the city of Berlin. NH Route 26 extends east towards the township of Cambridge and eventually into Maine. It extends west through Dixville Notch to the town of Colebrook.

<text>Groveton is a census-designated place (CDP) and the primary village in the town of Northumberland in Coos County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,068 at the 2020 census. It is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 110.

==History==
===Fort Wentworth===
Fort Wentworth was a colonial fort built in 1755 at the junction of the Upper Ammonoosuc River and Connecticut River, in Northumberland, New Hampshire, just downstream from the present site of Groveton.

===Paper mill===
Diamond International Papers was originally the hub of Groveton. Diamond International was replaced by James River Paper Company, which was followed by Wausau Paper. In 2008 Wausau ceased production in its Groveton mill, which in turn precluded the trains from stopping in Groveton. 

There were plans to turn the mill into a biomass plant, but as of January 2012, plans for buying the mill had fallen through. After an interview with former mill employees, the town of Northumberland decided to demolish the mill for scrap metals. With the price of metals at an all-time high, the town would make more money with the metals than waiting for the mill to sell. Plans for the future site included an LNG plant, which would have brought 80 or so jobs to the North Country. However, the planned development did not materialize.

===Hydrogen power plant===
Q Hydrogen, in conjunction with state and local political and development officials, is a developer of a hydrogen production system using water.

Electricity production has begun at the site of the old paper mill, which has been scraped clean of most evidence that the facility existed there.

===Steam locomotive===
A coal-powered steam locomotive originally owned by the Odell Manufacturing Company paper mill is publicly displayed as a tourist attraction. Having last seen use in the mid-1960s, it is presently maintained by Wausau Mills and Groveton Paper Board. The community beautification committee &quot;dresses it up&quot; every Christmas and maintains the surrounding area.

===Riverside Speedway and Adventure Park===
In 1964, Riverside Speedway, a 1/4 mile banked oval track, opened in Groveton. In late 2014 the speedway was purchased and underwent a name change. It was sold again in late 2019 and renamed Riverside Speedway and Adventure Park. In the coming years upgrades are planned for the facility to be a four-season event location, including ATV/UTV and other off-road events as well as snow machine racing. It features weekly racing series and is a popular venue in local auto racing.

===The Early Show===
Groveton was featured on &quot;The Early Show&quot; on January 5, 2012. It was a story on the mill and featured Karen Brown of &quot;The Early Show&quot; and Roger Caron.

<text>Hadley&#x27;s Purchase is a township located in the southernmost portion of Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. As of the 2020 census, the purchase had a population of zero. The purchase lies entirely within the White Mountain National Forest.

In New Hampshire, locations, grants, townships (which are different from towns), and purchases are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited).

== History ==
The purchase takes its name from Henry G. Hadley, who bought approximately from the state in 1834 for $500.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the purchase has a total area of , all land other than streams. The highest point in the purchase is above sea level, along its eastern border. The highest summit in Hadley&#x27;s Purchase is Mount Crawford, in the center of the purchase.

U.S. Route 302 in neighboring Hart&#x27;s Location roughly parallels the southern and western limits of the purchase, passing within approximately to of the border.

<doc id="124604" wikidata="Q2418119" url="?curid=124604" title="Jefferson, New Hampshire">
<text>Jefferson is a town in Coos County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,043 at the 2020 census. It is home to parts of the White Mountain National Forest in the south and northeast and to Santa&#x27;s Village, a Christmas-themed amusement park. There are also several private campgrounds, motels and inns.

Jefferson is part of the Berlin, New Hampshire-Vermont Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth first made land grants in this area in 1765, but the location was so deep in unexplored territory that few settlers took up their claims. So soon after the French and Indian War, in which certain Native American tribes in New England were allied with the French, English colonists did not want to be exposed on the frontier.

Colonel Joseph Whipple (1738–1816) took a grant and cut trails through the forests to build a &quot;manor&quot; house. He named the town &quot;Dartmouth&quot; after William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, the patron of Dartmouth College. Brother to William Whipple, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Colonel Whipple renamed the town &quot;Jefferson&quot; four years prior to Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s election as president. The state legislature granted the town a new charter as &quot;Jefferson&quot; on December 8, 1796.

In the mid-19th century, the boundary with the adjacent township of Kilkenny was moved so as to include that township&#x27;s few residents in Jefferson.
Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, a local farm boy born in 1832, became a world-famous inventor of aerostats (dirigibles) and other devices. Consulting President Abraham Lincoln, he organized a balloon corps during the Civil War, and went on to invent the ice-making machine, and later the water-gas process. For years, the latter was used to fuel gas lights in hundreds of cities. His father, Clovis Lowe, had been part owner in 1832 of nearby Low and Burbank&#x27;s Grant, which contains much of Mount Adams and Mount Madison. Lowe is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 19) in Jefferson.

In 1885, a landslide on the north side of Cherry Mountain demolished the Stanley farm, mortally wounding a worker. Local hotels immediately arranged daily excursions to view the scene, now marked by a New Hampshire historical marker (number 152) titled &quot;Cherry Mountain Slide&quot;. Jefferson&#x27;s third marker (number 229) honors Deborah Vicker, known as &quot;Granny Stalbird&quot;, who is said to have brought the first bible to the north country.
During the early 1900s, Jefferson was a popular summer resort, boasting one of the largest &quot;grand hotels&quot; in the White Mountains—the Waumbek, with accommodations for nearly 300 guests. The hotel had its own rail branch, to deliver guests directly to the hotel from Boston and New York without changing trains. It was destroyed by fire on May 9, 1928.

At tourism&#x27;s peak, Jefferson had over 30 inns and boarding houses, accessible by several mainline depots, including Riverton, Baileys, Meadows, and Highlands. Some of the original station buildings remain, although most have been moved to nearby locations. The tracks were removed in the 1920s. The wider ownership of automobiles gave people more choices for vacation destinations, and the Great Depression reduced vacations for years. By the end of this period, many people sought other venues than grand hotels.

A number of historic, architecturally interesting structures remain from the resort era. The Waumbek Cottages provided a backdrop for the popular White Mountains Festival of the Arts until 1979. In March 2006, the Waumbek Cottages Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1988 and 1989, Jefferson gained national attention when a local volunteer firefighter was charged and tried in connection with dozens of arson fires that had plagued the area. The defendant was acquitted at trial.

==Geography==
Jefferson is located on U.S. Route 2 between Lancaster and Randolph, west of the midpoint between the Vermont and Maine borders. Set astride the broad Israel River valley, the town commands remarkable views of the Presidential Range and other White Mountain summits. Mount Starr King, with an elevation of and named for Thomas Starr King, is the highest point in town, near the town&#x27;s northern border. It is regularly traversed by hikers scaling nearby Mount Waumbek, one of the &quot;four-thousand footers&quot;—the 48 peaks above in New Hampshire. Jefferson lies fully within the Connecticut River watershed.

In the past few years, thousands of acres of Jefferson have been sold or donated by private interests to the White Mountain National Forest. These include the Randolph Town Forest, a part of which is within the boundaries of Jefferson, the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, and Mount Starr King.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.66% of the town.

<text>Meadowlands is a city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 134 at the 2020 census.

Saint Louis County Highway 133 (CR 133), County 5 (CR 5), and County 29 (CR 29) are three of the main routes in Meadowlands.

==History==

Meadowlands, as its name would suggest, is one of the few areas of arable land in Saint Louis County. While Meadowlands prospered and grew due to the support it provided to the region&#x27;s farms, the steady decline in those same farms (and the large families they supported) during the mid-late 1980s and early 1990s heralded the beginning of the town&#x27;s gradual decline.

During its heyday, Meadowlands was home to a number of businesses including a Ford dealership (which also carried New Holland farm machinery), a bank, a farmer&#x27;s cooperative store, a grocery store, a commercial laundry, a cheese factory, various restaurants, a movie theater and the Toivola–Meadowlands School, a K–12 institution. However, the loss of the large farm families gradually reduced the student population until Independent School District 710 chose to close the school. An attempt was made to convert T–M into a &quot;Charter School&quot;, but it ultimately proved unsuccessful. Before closing, the school sent its 9-man football team to the Minnesota State Finals twice in the 1980s.

Currently it possesses only a single bar/grill establishment, and four places of worship.

The retail and service related facilities have seen a slight increase in business due to the recent expansion of tourism related to bird-watching. The rivers, lakes, fields and arboreal bog areas around Meadowlands offer visitors the opportunity to view species ranging from small song birds, such as the waxwing, to Bald Eagles.

Also winter brings with it increased snowmobile traffic, as a former Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railroad line runs along the eastern edge of the town. Now converted to an ATV–snowmobile trail, this former rail line runs from Alborn in the south, north to Pengilly on the Iron Range.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Milan ( ) is a town in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,358 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
Originally named &quot;Paulsburg&quot; in 1771 after Paul Wentworth, the town was incorporated on December 16, 1824. In that year, Governor Levi Woodbury authorized a name change to &quot;Milan&quot;. 

Prior to 1820, there were but few inhabitants. In 1819, the population was approximately fourteen; ten years passed and the number had increased four-fold. Like the other towns around it, Milan&#x27;s first industries were lumbering operations, and agriculture was for some time subordinate to this. The first farms were developed on Milan Hill. The soil was warmer, more free from frost, and, for some years, produced quite liberally in response to the labors of the pioneers. But they were not permanently as productive as they gave promise, and many of those settlers who remained sought the most valuable lands along the river. Some of the names of the early pioneers of Milan include Ellingwood, Hodgdon, Fogg, Hinds, Roberts, Hagar, Sargent, Nay, Twitchell, and Newell.

<text>Cold Spring is a city in Stearns County, Minnesota, United States, at the gateway of the Sauk River Chain of Lakes, an interconnected system of 14 bay-like lakes fed and connected by the Sauk River.

During the grasshopper plagues of the 1870s, Assumption Chapel, also known as the Grasshopper Chapel, was built in petition for relief from the locusts.

Cold Spring has three properties on the National Register of Historic Places: the John Oster House and Ferdinand Peters House, both built in 1907, and the Eugene Hermanutz House, built in 1912.

<text>Holdingford is a city in Stearns County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 708 at the 2010 census. It claims to be &quot;The Gateway to Lake Wobegon&quot;, the fictional central Minnesota town created by author Garrison Keillor.

Holdingford is part of the St. Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Writing in 1997, Jewish-American historian of America&#x27;s religious architecture Marilyn J. Chiat described early settlement in the region, &quot;Father Francis X. Pierz, a missionary to Indians in central Minnesota, published a series of articles in 1851 in German Catholic newspapers advocating Catholic settlement in central Minnesota. Large numbers of immigrants, mainly German, but also Slovenian and Polish, responded. Over 20 parishes where formed in what is now Stearns County, each centered on a church-oriented hamlet. As the farmers prospered, the small frame churches were replaced by more substantial buildings of brick or stone... Stearns County retains in its German character and is still home to one of the largest rural Catholic populations in Anglo-America.&quot;

Holdingford was platted in the 1870s by Randolph Holding on a site near a ford. A post office has been in operation at Holdingford since 1872. According to local historian Fr. Vincent Yzermans, the earliest settlers and founders of St. Mary&#x27;s Church were Irish-Americans and Canadian Gaelic-speaking immigrants from Sight Point, Cape Mabou, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. For this reason, Holdingford was originally called, &quot;The Scotch Settlement.&quot; The early Scottish-Canadian pioneers of Holdingford included descendants of Clan Stewart, Clan MacArthur, Clan Campbell, Clan Kennedy, and Clan MacPherson.

In an interview with Rev. Alex D. MacDonald for the book &quot;Mabou Pioneers&quot;, one elderly Holdingford settler recalled, &quot;As I look back, I can remember they were a jolly group of people, and when all their children were born, they made quite a gathering when they were all together at parties in their different homes, with singing of Scottish songs, violin music, and of course, dancing Scottish reels.&quot;

The Highland Scottish dancing at local ceilidhs was often &quot;a source of scandal&quot; to their Steans County German neighbors. Despite the later Germanisation and Polonisation of both parishes in Holdingford, Fr. Vincent Yzermans often heard the famous lines from the &quot;Canadian Boat Song&quot; quoted in later years by the descendants of the Holdingford Scottish-Americans who had stayed, 
:&quot;From the lone shieling of the misty island 
:Mountains divide us and the waste of seas 
:But still the blood is strong, the heart is Highland
:And we in dreams behold the Hebrides.&quot;

As the Holdingford area is traditionally ethnically polarized between German- and Polish-Americans, who until assimilation lessened the mutual distrust, attended different Catholic parishes and only rarely intermarried. The Holdingford area remains, however, a center of traditional German and Polish folk music and of the speaking in local homes of both Silesian Polish and &quot;Stearns County German&quot;.

During the 1880s and &#x27;90s, a small farming colony of Slovaks and Rusyns migrated from the Austro-Hungarian Empire via Pennsylvania, and then settled on homesteads to the northeast of Holdingford. The immigrants were mainly Roman Catholics, or Byzantine Catholics from the Slovak Greek Catholic Church or the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, but enough converted to the Russian Orthodox Church that, with the assistance of Fr. John Maliarevsky from St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Minneapolis, they were able to build St. Mary&#x27;s Russian Orthodox Church around 1897. Local converts to Protestantism under the influence of visiting theology student John Sabol in 1886, founded the Slovak Congregational Church, locally called &quot;the Country Church&quot;, which still stands across a country road from the former site of St. Mary&#x27;s Orthodox Church.

In 1902, Bishop Tikhon, the future Patriarch of Moscow, travelled from Minneapolis to bless the first completed Orthodox Church. While still a seminarian, Vasily Basalyga, who later became the Head of the Japanese Orthodox Church, also served at St. Mary&#x27;s Russian Orthodox Church in Holdingford as a Reader and schoolteacher. The parish altar lamp was a personal gift from Tsar Nicholas II.

During the 1920s and &#x27;30s, the Russian Orthodox priests from Holdingford sometimes made missionary visits to the Rusyn Americans living in a similar farming settlement in Browerville, Minnesota. They made some converts, but otherwise had little success. The Divine Liturgy was still offered in the traditional Old Church Slavonic liturgical language and only in 1978 did the Orthodox Church in America, which supplied the Orthodox priests who still visited St. Mary&#x27;s, switch to Elizabethan English instead. In August 1978, the 14th-century Wonder Working Icon of the Our Lady of Tikhvin was brought for veneration from Holy Trinity Cathedral in Chicago to St Mary&#x27;s Russian Orthodox Church in Holdingford, by Archbishop John of Chicago and Minneapolis. As of 1985, however, Orthodox laity continued to attend services from the surrounding communities of Bowlus, Upsala, Browerville, and St. Cloud. During the late 1980s, however, the parish &quot;metrical books&quot; were transferred to the Cathedral in Minneapolis and the Church was closed. Writing in 1997, Marilyn J. Chiat, described the empty church as, &quot;a small white Gothic Revival building crowned with a tin onion dome, a rare sight on the edge of a cornfield in Minnesota.&quot; In 2002, a family with roots in the parish removed the bell from St. Mary&#x27;s church in Holdingford and gave it as a donation to Holy Myrrh Bearers Orthodox Church in St. Cloud.

The only priest who lies buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church cemetery in Holdingford is Fr. H. William Wilkens. According to his 1914 obituaries in local newspapers, Fr. Wilkens was a member of the Belgian nobility from Namur, and former seminary professor in Galveston, Texas. After concerns about his health forced a transfer to the Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Cloud, Fr. Wilkens served at a series of local parishes. He also became very well known locally in the decades before his death as a highly intelligent German-language essayist on religious and philosophical topics and a regular contributor to &quot;Der Nordstern&quot;.

===World War I===
Similarly to other Stearns County German- and Polish-American communities, the Holdingford area opposed American entry into the First World War, but produced many local recruits and draftees once America declared war on Imperial Germany in May 1917. In November 1917, the largely German-American parish of St. Mary&#x27;s heard a &quot;very impressive sermon&quot; on American patriotism by Fr. Scheuer followed by the presentation of the parish&#x27;s service flag, which bore 15-stars in honor of each of the young men from the parish who were serving in the United States military. America&#x27;s Independence Day 1918 was understandingly the largest ever seen in Holdingford, beginning with a Requiem Mass at St. Hedwig&#x27;s Church for the fallen soldiers of all the Allied Armies, followed by a dinner served at noon by the women of the parish. Five Holdingford-area Doughboys lost their lives while serving in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF), Private Nicholas Heinz, who died on 13 September 1918 from wounds received in the 2 September capture of a German machine gun nest near Vilcey-sur-Trey, for which he was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross; Ernest Roehrs, who died of the influenza on Sept. 29, 1918 at Camp Funston, Kansas; Gregor Hartung, who was killed in action on France in October 1918; John Elkanic who was killed in action on 22 October 1918 and buried in the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial; and Private Francis Feia who was killed in action on the fall of 1918 and whose Polish-American parents only received definitive word of his death on 12 July 1919. A Tridentine Requiem Mass was offered for Pvt. Feia at St Hedwig&#x27;s Church on 21 July 1919. Holdingford&#x27;s American Legion Post #211 was later named in Private Feia&#x27;s honor.

===Prohibition era===
During Prohibition, Holdingford earned the title of &quot;moonshine capital of Minnesota&quot;. According to historian Elaine Davis, this was because organized crime figures from the Twin Cities, Chicago, and Kansas City, made frequent trips to the Holdingford area to purchase Minnesota 13; a very high quality moonshine distilled locally by Polish- and German-American farmers with the collusion of corrupt local politicians and law enforcement.

In October 1923, four Stearns County residents, including mobbed up County Commissioner Val Herman, were arrested by Federal Prohibition Enforcement Agents following an extremely violent car chase between the Pitzl Brewery in New Munich and Holdingford. The other suspects were Stanley Dobis of St. Anna, as well as Albin Bohmer and Joseph Sigmeth of Avon, Minnesota. All were held in Minneapolis pending trial on Federal charges of violating the Volstead Act.

According to local historian Fr. Vincent A Yzermans, during the Prohibition era, &quot;a popular little ditty was being sung and hummed along the highways and byways of Holding Township&quot;:
:&quot;Mother makes brandy from cherries;
:Pop distills whiskey and gin;
:Sister sells wine from the grapes on our vine -- 
:Good grief, how the money rolls in!&quot;

In June 1933, Clarence Olson, alias Tuffy, a bootlegger and gangster based in Eagle Bend, Minnesota who, according to &quot;The Long Prairie Leader&quot;, &quot;has long had a reputation as a liquor runner and hijacker and who has been claimed by many to be the toughest man between Minneapolis and Duluth&quot;, met his destiny in a Holdingford area gunfight. After arriving with two associates at the farmhouse of Holdingford bootleggers Joseph and Anthony Dzierweczynski to buy 85 gallons of Minnesota 13, Tuffy Olson first announced that the Dzierweczynskis would now be paid in cash. Then, however, Tuffy Olson and his enforcer Harley Buchan drew their sidearms and announced that they intended to take to 85 gallons of moonshine for free. Joseph Dzierweczynski, however, managed to flee the room and returned with a loaded shotgun. As he and Buchan fled back to their escape vehicle, Tuffy Olson received two fatal shotgun blasts in the back. Following an investigation by the Stearns and Todd County Sheriff&#x27;s Departments, Tuffy&#x27;s two surviving enforcers and the Dzierweczynski brothers were both arrested pending criminal charges.

According to the &quot;Long Prairie Leader&quot;, &quot;Tuffy Olson has for years had a reputation of being a booze runner who has had many conflicts with the law. At the time of his death, a Federal charge of illegal possession of liquor was hanging over his head, the trial being scheduled for later in the year. It is alleged that he peddled liquor at dance halls over a wide area and other rumors credit him with having hijacked many liquor runners in this section of the State.&quot;

===World War II===
Following the 1941 entry of the United States into the Second World War, young men from every ethnic background living in Holding Township became voluntary recruits to the United States military. In April 1944, Holdingford native Private Walter Krystosek was killed in action at the Anzio landing. On New Years Day 1945, Clarence Scepaniak, was a paratrooper serving in the European Theater with the 17th Airborne Division when he was taken prisoner by the enemy. After being held as a POW in conditions that traumatized him for the rest of his life at Stalag IV-B, Scepaniak was liberated and returned him to Holdingford. He remained silent about his experiences until finally giving an interview about them in 1985. In July 2017, the remains of United States Navy Fireman First Class Elmer Kerestes, a Holdingford native who was killed in action aboard the &quot;U.S.S. Oklahoma&quot; during the attack on Pearl Harbor, were posthumously identified through DNA testing by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency and returned to his family for burial. Kerestes&#x27; whole 25-mile funeral route from Melrose to Holdingford was lined with local people who wished to pay their respects as his American flag-draped casket passed by. According to attendee Jed Konsor, “When I see that casket draped in the American flag, that says something to me. That says that guy fought for us. Died for us. That&#x27;s why we are here today.&quot; Kerestes&#x27; was buried next to his parents in Holdingford with full military honors.

<text>Northumberland is a town located in western Coös County, New Hampshire, United States, north of Lancaster. It is part of the Berlin, NH–VT micropolitan statistical area. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 2,126, of whom 1,068 lived in the village of Groveton.

==History==
North of the mountain ridge known as Cape Horn, near the Connecticut River, are the remains of Fort Wentworth, built by the New Hampshire Militia in 1755 during the French and Indian War. The town was granted as &quot;Stonington&quot; in 1761 to John Hogg and others by Governor Benning Wentworth, and first settled in 1767 by Thomas Burnside and Daniel Spaulding. Burnside was a member of Rogers&#x27; Rangers.

The land was regranted by Governor John Wentworth in 1771 as &quot;Northumberland&quot;, the name derived from Northumberland in England. The town was incorporated November 16, 1779. In 1797 the town voted to construct a meeting house, which was completed in 1799. The structure can still be found alongside U.S. Route 3.

Groveton is the northern terminus of a railroad track owned by the New Hampshire &amp; Vermont Railroad, where it intersects the St. Lawrence &amp; Atlantic Railroad. This was formerly the junction of the Grand Trunk Railway and the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad—a major point of access for the northern White Mountains.

The area was once known for its large corn and potato crop, starch mills, and manufacturing (leather, shoe pegs). More recently, the town economy centered on the lumber industry. That changed in 2007, however, when the Wausau Paper mill closed, eliminating 300 jobs.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.96% of the town. The Connecticut River, which forms the New Hampshire–Vermont border, runs along the western edge of town. The Upper Ammonoosuc River runs through town in a southwesterly direction to the Connecticut and is crossed by a covered bridge at Groveton.

There are several mountains in town, including Morse Mountain ( above sea level), Cape Horn (), Moore Mountain (), and Spaulding Hill (). The town&#x27;s highest point is above sea level on a spur of the Pilot Range on the town&#x27;s eastern boundary.

Cape Horn State Forest is located in the central portion of the town boundaries.

The nucleus of Northumberland (outside of Groveton) is arranged along US 3, which runs along the Connecticut River. Route 110 intersects US 3 in Northumberland and runs east toward adjacent Stark.

<doc id="124615" wikidata="Q1012284" url="?curid=124615" title="Paynesville, Minnesota">
<text>Paynesville is a city in Stearns County, Minnesota, United States, on Lake Koronis, in the central part of the state. The population was 2,388 at the 2020 census. It is part of the St. Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Paynesville was platted in 1857 by Edwin E. Payne, and named for him. The town was completely evacuated to the relative safety of Richmond and St. Cloud during the 1862 Dakota War; the Dakota burned the townsite to the ground. The town was subsequently rebuilt, this time with the addition of a wooden stockade built by the U.S. Army.

The arrival of the Soo Line and Great Northern Railway in 1886 spurred increased settlement near the railroad lines, leading to the formation of the new settlements of Jim Town along the Soo Line and North Paynesville near the Great Northern. Jim town, on the site of today&#x27;s downtown Paynesville, became the largest of the three Paynesvilles, eventually merging with the others as New Paynesville, later shortened back to Paynesville.

<text>Sauk Centre ( ) is a city in Stearns County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 4,555 at the 2020 census. Sauk Centre is part of the St. Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Sauk Centre is the birthplace of Sinclair Lewis, a novelist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. It inspired his fictional Gopher Prairie, the setting of Lewis&#x27;s 1920 novel &quot;Main Street&quot;. There are two sculptures of Lewis in Sauk Centre; one life size sculpture just outside the public library named after him and a bust, sculpted by Joseph Kiselewski, inside the library.

==History==
The town was originally named by a lottery. The eight original town shareholders submitted suggestions for a name, and Sauk Centre was selected. The name was submitted by Alexander Moore, who originally bought and platted the town. Sauk refers to the many place names associated with the Sauk tribe (Sauk River, Sauk Rapids, Little Sauk, Osakis, etc). Centre (the British spelling of &quot;center&quot;) refers to the town&#x27;s central location between Sauk Rapids and Lake Osakis. When the Sauk Centre post office was established it used the spelling &quot;Sauk Center&quot;, until 1936 when the city won its fight to spell the name as Moore suggested. Local lore has it that five refugees from the Sauk tribe had been killed by settlers in an ambush on the shores of Lake Osakis away.

Sauk Centre contains the Sinclair Lewis Boyhood Home, a National Historic Landmark. Two other properties and a historic district are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: The Palmer House built in 1901 and expanded in 1916, the Minnesota Home School for Girls built 1911–1935, and the Original Main Street Historic District built 1920–1947.

==Geography==

Sauk Centre is located along Interstate 94/U.S. Highway 52, U.S. Highway 71, and Minnesota State Highway 28. It is approximately northwest of the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metropolitan area.

<doc id="124622" wikidata="Q2323309" url="?curid=124622" title="Pittsburg, New Hampshire">
<text>Pittsburg is a town in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 800 at the 2020 census. It is the northernmost town in New Hampshire and the largest town by area in New England. U.S. Route 3 is the only major highway in the town, although the northern terminus of New Hampshire Route 145 also lies within Pittsburg.

Pittsburg is part of the Berlin, New Hampshire micropolitan area.

== History ==

Pittsburg derives its name from William Pitt, Prime Minister of Great Britain. Prior to its incorporation in 1840, the area was settled and known as the Territory of Indian Stream. It had the unique distinction of having been its own microstate briefly during the 1830s, called the Republic of Indian Stream, due to an ambiguous boundary between the United States and Canada.

The Indian Stream Schoolhouse on Tabor Road, which dates to 1897, is listed in both the National Register of Historic Places and the New Hampshire State Register of Historic Places; the town hall on Main Street, which dates to 1883, is listed in the State Register.

== Geography ==
Pittsburg shares an international border with Québec province, Canada, to its west and north, and borders the states of Maine (to the east) and Vermont (a very small portion to the southwest). Directly to the south is Clarksville. Pittsburg is the only New Hampshire municipality to border Canada, the only one that borders both Maine and Vermont, the only one to share a land border with Vermont, and the only town entirely north of the 45th parallel. Pittsburg contains the only part of New Hampshire west of the Connecticut River, as that river defines the Vermont state line from Clarksville southward. The Pittsburg–Chartierville Border Crossing, New Hampshire&#x27;s only Canadian border crossing, is located in the town, at the northern terminus of U.S. Route 3. The western edge of Pittsburg is defined by Halls Stream, being the &quot;northwesternmost headwaters of the Connecticut River&quot;, which defined (ambiguously) the border in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.

Contained within the boundaries of Pittsburg are the Connecticut Lakes, which form the beginning of the Connecticut River. Early maps (e.g. 1854) also show several grants that were incorporated into the eastern edge of Pittsburg, including &quot;Carlisle No. 1&quot;, &quot;Webster/Carlisle No. 2&quot; and &quot;Hubbards No. 3&quot;, all north of Atkinson and Gilmanton Academy Grant.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , the largest in New Hampshire and New England of any municipality incorporated as a town. A total of of Pittsburg are land and are water, the latter comprising 3.43% of the town.

The highest point in Pittsburg is the summit of Stub Hill, at . Mount Magalloway, elevation , is a prominent summit reachable by hiking trail.

Some of the same trails are used in the summer for ATVs.

Another focus in the area for tourists is fishing and hunting. Pittsburg is home to the four Connecticut Lakes, Back Lake, part of Lake Francis, and numerous smaller water bodies. The lakes are annually stocked with fish and allow for fishing weekends. The area is known for fly fishing. Two sections of the Connecticut River are fly fishing only, including the &quot;Trophy Stretch&quot;. The Connecticut Lakes Region has attracted anglers and hunters since the early 1900s. There are maps on the local snowmobile club&#x27;s website that show trails in Pittsburg as well as roads and access points to the lakes and rivers.

Lake Francis State Park allows for lakeside camping, fishing, and canoeing on the lake or the Connecticut River. Deer Mountain Campground enables camping and picnicking on the Connecticut River.

<doc id="124623" wikidata="Q2418102" url="?curid=124623" title="Randolph, New Hampshire">
<text>Randolph is a heavily forested town in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States, extending from the northern slopes of the White Mountains of the Presidential Range (to the south) to the Crescent Range and Berlin (to the north), with U.S. Route 2 cutting through the middle. The northern and southern parts of Randolph are within the White Mountain National Forest and the Ice Gulch Town Forest, while the central part is the settled portion of town. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 328.

Randolph is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Randolph was incorporated in 1824, after being originally granted as &quot;Durand&quot; in 1772. The town was named after John Randolph, a Virginia congressman and senator, and a descendant of Pocahontas.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.13% of the town.

Randolph&#x27;s geography is mountainous. The south side of the town includes the northern slopes of the Presidentials. The north side of the town includes four main mountains: Mount Crescent, Black Crescent Mountain, Mount Randolph and Pond Hill. Dividing the northerly slopes from the southerly slopes is U.S. Route 2. There are no trails maintained to the top of Black Crescent Mountain or Pond Hill. The highest point in Randolph is on the town&#x27;s southern border, atop a knob on Howker Ridge, a spur of Mount Madison.

The settled part of Randolph is divided into two main areas: Randolph &quot;valley&quot;, where town hall is, and Randolph Hill, which has several roads all connected to a main road called Randolph Hill Road. Randolph Hill has the site of the Mt. Crescent House (hotel), which opened in 1883 as the &quot;Randolph Hill House&quot; and was torn down in 1971. Randolph also had &quot;Ravine House&quot; on Durand Road, straight north of the Appalachia trailhead. Other sections of town include the area west of Durand Road, which includes Valley Road and a number of houses along Route 2, towards Jefferson. The main Randolph train station was at Appalachia. Other, secondary stations included &quot;Randolph East&quot; on the Dolly Copp (or &quot;Pinkham B&quot;) Road, and Bowman, at the height of land to the west.

===Adjacent municipalities===
* Berlin (north)
* Gorham (east)
* Thompson and Meserve&#x27;s Purchase (southeast)
* Low and Burbank&#x27;s Grant (south)
* Jefferson (west)
* Kilkenny (northwest)

===Climate===
Temperatures in the summer can reach nearly , though that is exceedingly rare, with summer days seldom getting above the 80s (°F) and summer nights frequently being in the 50s or even the 40s. Temperatures in the winter can be below . Ice Gulch, in the forest in the northern part of Randolph, contains the largest known subalpine cold-air talus barren in New Hampshire, with a microclimate significantly colder than the rest of the town, containing ice blocks that sometimes survive the entire summer without melting.

== Demographics ==
As of the census of 2000, there were 339 people, 146 households, and 104 families residing in the town. The population density was 7.2 people per square mile (2.8/km). There were 298 housing units at an average density of 6.3 per square mile (2.4/km). The racial makeup of the town was 96.46% White, 0.88% African American, 0.29% Native American, 0.29% Asian, 0.29% from other races, and 1.77% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.59% of the population.

There were 146 households, out of which 26.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 69.2% were married couples living together, 1.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.1% were non-families. 24.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.74.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 19.2% under the age of 18, 5.0% from 18 to 24, 25.1% from 25 to 44, 32.2% from 45 to 64, and 18.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46 years. For every 100 females, there were 104.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 106.0 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $50,139, and the median income for a family was $52,083. Males had a median income of $40,625 versus $35,208 for females. The per capita income for the town was $25,092. About 2.0% of families and 1.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under the age of eighteen or sixty-five or over.

Many houses in Randolph are summer/vacation homes. Historically, vacationers tended to visit the hotels, reachable by horse-drawn carriage from the Randolph train station; but as the automobile became more popular, the hotels declined and private vacation homes became more prevalent. Vacationing in the far north was particularly advantageous before the air conditioner became common, as Randolph summers are rarely very hot—and never hot at all in the higher mountain areas.

==Parks and recreation ==
The Randolph Mountain Club was founded in 1910, with the primary goal of restoring trails destroyed by logging. The club&#x27;s mission is &quot;to promote the enjoyment of the Randolph area through hiking, trail development and maintenance, upkeep of camps and shelters, and the sharing of the collective knowledge of its members.&quot; The club operates four camps in the White Mountain National Forest—two enclosed cabins and two semi-enclosed shelters—with a caretaker in residence year-round.

There are two artificial lakes (or ponds) in Randolph: Durand Lake is present year-round, and Ravine House Pool exists in summer from the damming of a mountain stream. There are tennis courts near the Ravine House Pool. All of these facilities are owned by the Town of Randolph and maintained in cooperation with the Randolph Foundation.

<doc id="124624" wikidata="Q7423922" url="?curid=124624" title="Sargent's Purchase, New Hampshire">
<text>Sargent&#x27;s Purchase is a township in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. It lies within the White Mountain National Forest, and the summit of Mount Washington is located within the township. As of the 2020 census, the population was zero.

In New Hampshire, locations, grants, townships (which are different from towns), and purchases are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town or city and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited).

==History==
The first known explorer to have set foot in what is now known as Sargent&#x27;s Purchase was Darby Field, who claimed to have made the first ascent of Mount Washington in 1642. Sargent&#x27;s Purchase was granted to Jacob Sargent and others on May 31, 1832. In May 1866, Sylvester Marsh of Campton, New Hampshire, began construction of the Mount Washington Cog Railway, primarily in Thompson and Meserve&#x27;s Purchase, but the uppermost half mile being within Sargent&#x27;s Purchase. The Cog Railway was completed in 1869.

== Geography ==
The township is in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and includes the summit of Mount Washington, the highest mountain in New England, with an elevation of above sea level. Other notable summits within the purchase include Mount Monroe, at ; Mount Isolation, at ; and Stairs Mountain, at . The Appalachian Trail crosses the northwestern part of the township, including the summit of Mount Washington, as well as the northeastern corner of the township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which , or 0.02%, are water. The Ammonoosuc River has its source on the west side of Mount Washington and drains the northwestern corner of the township, part of the Connecticut River watershed. The northeastern corner of the township, drained by the Peabody River, is part of the Androscoggin River watershed. The remainder of the township is part of the Saco River watershed: the Dry River begins in Oakes Gulf on the south side of Mount Washington, while the Ellis River begins in Tuckerman Ravine on the east side of the mountain. The Rocky Branch, a third tributary of the Saco, drains the southern part of Sargent&#x27;s Purchase.

<text>Second College Grant (also known as the Dartmouth College Grant) is a township in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The area of this township is owned and controlled by Dartmouth College. As of the 2020 census, the grant had a population of one.

In New Hampshire, locations, grants, purchases, and townships (which are different from towns) are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited).

Trails and cabins are available for use by the Dartmouth community, and are maintained by the Dartmouth Outing Club and Dartmouth&#x27;s Outdoor Programs Office. The DOC maintains three cabins available for rent by DOC members (Peaks, Alder Brook, and Stoddard), and the OPO maintains seven cabins for use by Dartmouth-affiliated individuals and their guests. Many freshmen spend a few days in the grant as part of their freshmen trips just before freshman orientation. The grant is also used for timber production, but forest-friendly, sustainable practices are employed.

== Geography ==
The grant is bounded by the Maine border to the east, Atkinson and Gilmanton Academy Grant to the north, Dix&#x27;s Grant to the west, and Wentworth Location to the south. One of the other contemporaneous &quot;Dartmouth&quot; grants was to the north of Dixville but was annexed as the eastern end of Clarksville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the grant has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.21%, are water. The highest point is a knoll just west of Mount Tucker.

Two rivers, the Dead Diamond and the Swift Diamond, flow through and join together in the Second College Grant. The Dead Diamond then flows into the Magalloway River in the southeastern corner of the grant. The entire grant is part of the Androscoggin River watershed.

== History ==

In 1766, New Hampshire Governor John Wentworth promised Eleazar Wheelock a grant of a township on which to build Dartmouth College. In 1770, a month after Wheelock received the royal charter, the governor granted the college the township of Landaff (east of present-day Woodsville, New Hampshire), but Wheelock, after viewing the land and others under consideration, decided to establish the college in Hanover. After the American Revolution the college lost its claim to Landaff in 1791, because of the grant&#x27;s royal derivation and rival claims by American settlers in Landaff.

While the Landaff case underwent litigation to resolve the rival claims, Vermont (then meeting in Norwich) came to the aid of the college and granted it the township of Wheelock (northwest of St. Johnsbury) in 1785. The college divided the town into lots and leased these to settlers. Over the years the college has sold most of the lots to meet financial needs but still holds title to some properties in the town.

In 1789, New Hampshire, anticipating the college&#x27;s loss of the Landaff Grant, made good on its original promise of a grant with the town of Clarksville (in northern New Hampshire). This is considered the First College Grant, as it was intended to replace the loss of the original Landaff Grant. The college sold most of this land in the first two years, and had sold off the rest by 1872.

The sale of the Clarksville Grant properties proved to be inadequate, and the college petitioned the state for an additional grant in 1792. Several proposals were made in the legislature, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1807 that the state responded with the Second College Grant. The lands of the Second College Grant proved to be unattractive to settlers, but sale of timber provided a small but steady income to the college over the next century and a half.

In 1947, Robert S. Monahan was hired as College Forester to oversee the College Grant, and since that time the multiple use philosophy of forest management has been formalized. As a result, the recreational and education concepts have become a prominent part of the grant&#x27;s management, with untold opportunities for use by the Dartmouth community.

In 1970, Monahan retired, and cutting operations were suspended while a committee, named by the Trustees of the College in 1968 in anticipation of Monahan&#x27;s retirement, evaluated the existing policies. The Prentiss &amp; Carlisle Company of Bangor, Maine, subsequently prepared a management plan which was transmitted to the college by the committee in early January 1970. This was adopted and referred to as the 10-20 Year Plan, with provisions for an annual sustained yield cut of approximately 4,000 cords per year for the following twenty years. The Seven Islands Land Company of Bangor was retained by the college to oversee forestry management and to implement the Prentiss &amp; Carlisle plan.

It was at this same time that Al Merrill was named Director of Outdoor Affairs and given responsibility for recreational and educational use of the Second College Grant along with oversight of the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge and the Dartmouth Outing Club.

In 1976 evidence of an increase in the spruce budworm had already reached epidemic proportions in Maine and Canada. In response to this blight, the College imposed a two-year moratorium on logging while a plan was developed. In 1978 the College implemented a salvage operation designed to remove the dead fir while saving as much spruce and hardwood as possible. The salvage operation lasted until 1986, at which time the remaining standing dead fir had decayed beyond use.

Once again the harvesting activity was halted while the College took stock of its forest resources and considered its future management options. Seven Islands Land Company conducted a timber cruise survey and used the growth and inventory data to prepare a new 10-20 year management plan. A consensus was reached that the college would be better served by having its own forester. A decision was then made to release Seven Islands Land company of its forest management responsibilities on the College Grant and to once again employ a College Forester, Edward Witt.

After carefully analyzing the data prepared by Seven Islands, Witt decided that the annual growth rate of the forest would allow for a sustainable annual cut of 6,000 cords. The forest plan was modified to allow harvesting as much as 10,000 cords for ten years in an effort to remove the poorer quality trees and improve the overall quality of the forest. This would be followed by several years of cutting lesser volumes but higher quality trees. Further, because the forest is managed for the benefit of wildlife, cutting operations were modified to reflect that policy. Since 1987, the forest has been managed accordingly, with the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department actively involved in the location, design, and methodology of the harvesting activity.

In 2019, Hell Gate Gorge cabin, built in 1974, burned down due to a chimney fire. Former Democratic candidate for New Hampshire governor, Colin Van Ostern, was staying in the cabin with several other guests during the incident.

== Demographics ==

As of the 2020 census, there was one person recorded living in the grant. In 1930, there were 17 people living in the grant; the population has been less than 10 since then and zero for the three censuses prior to 2020.

<text>Shelburne is a town in Coös County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 353 at the 2020 census. It is located in the White Mountains, and part of the White Mountain National Forest is in the south. Shelburne is home to Leadmine State Forest. The Appalachian Trail crosses the town.

Shelburne is part of the Berlin, NH-VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
First granted in 1769 by Governor John Wentworth, the town was named for William Petty Fitzmaurice, Earl of Shelburne. He was a supporter of independence for the American colonies, and at his insistence, King George III recognized the independence of the United States. The town was first settled in 1771, and incorporated on December 13, 1820, when Shelburne voters chose to keep the name. It included &quot;Shelburne Addition&quot;, that was set off and incorporated in 1836 as Gorham.

On August 3, 1781, the town was attacked by a party of six Indians, who had earlier raided Bethel and Gilead, Maine. They killed one man and took another into captivity. The rest of the inhabitants fled to Hark Hill, where they spent the night before sheltering in Fryeburg.

Shelburne provided excellent soil for farming on either side of the Androscoggin River, but not far from the stream it becomes mountainous. The Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad, which opened to Gorham on July 23, 1851, and later became the Grand Trunk Railway, passed through the southern part of the town. In 1859, the population was 480.

Located at the northern end of the Mount Washington Valley, Shelburne has a beautiful grove of birch trees, popular with artists and photographers, dedicated to the town&#x27;s soldiers who served in World War II.

In early 1944, the remains of a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp in the town were converted to form Camp Stark, which held about 250 German POWs. This was the only World War II POW camp located in New Hampshire. Most of the men in the camp performed hard labor in the nearby forests, supplying wood for the paper mills in Berlin, New Hampshire. Some of the men eventually came back to live in the United States and Canada after the war ended, and the camp was closed in 1946.

<text>Ashland is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,938 at the 2020 census, down from 2,076 at the 2010 census. Located near the geographical center of the state, Ashland is home to Scribner-Fellows State Forest.

The main village of the town, where 1,082 people lived at the 2020 census, is defined as the Ashland census-designated place (CDP) and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 25 with NH Route 132.

==History==

Ashland was once the southwestern corner of Holderness, chartered in 1751 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. But hostilities during the French and Indian War delayed settlement, and in 1761, it was regranted as &quot;New Holderness&quot; (although &quot;New&quot; would be dropped in 1816). Settled in 1763, the town was predominantly agricultural except for Holderness Village on the Squam River, with falls that drop about before meeting the Pemigewasset River. The falls provided water power for mills, and in 1770–1771, a sawmill and gristmill were built. The Squam Lake Woolen Mill was established in 1840. Goods manufactured at local factories included hosiery, gloves, sporting equipment, wood products and paper.

The Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad entered in 1849, carrying freight but also tourists bound for hotels on the Squam Lakes, to which they traveled by steamer up the Squam River. The interests of the industrialized settlement increasingly diverged from those of the farming community, however, and in 1868 Holderness Village was set off as Ashland, named for Ashland, the Kentucky estate of Henry Clay. The last textile mill, the L.W. Packard Company, would close in 2002, and Ashland is today a residential and resort community.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 4.63 of the town. Bounded on the west by the Pemigewasset River, Ashland is drained by the Squam River and Owl Brook. Little Squam Lake is on the eastern boundary.
