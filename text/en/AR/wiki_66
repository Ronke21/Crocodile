<text>Neligh is a city and county seat in Antelope County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 1,599 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1872, John D. Neligh and a few of his friends took a trip up the Elkhorn River from West Point, Nebraska. Neligh took note of the scenic landscape and thought it would be the ideal setting for a town and the county seat. He immediately left for Omaha to buy 520 acres for the town site. Misunderstanding the prime land he was selling, Omaha banker Herman Kountze sold the land required to develop Neligh. He was apparently not aware it would make the ideal county seat, which Neligh eventually became. The records were moved to Neligh on January 1, 1884. Neligh was platted in 1873 by John Neligh and others, and named for him.

=== White Buffalo Girl ===
In May 1877, the Ponca tribe was forced to leave their homeland on the Niobrara River and move to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. The rigors of the journey and resettlement led to the death of one-third of the tribe&#x27;s population. During the migration, an 18-month-old girl named White Buffalo Girl died near Neligh. Her father, Black Elk, asked the townspeople &quot;to respect the grave of my child just as they do the graves of their own dead&quot;. She was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Neligh, and her grave tended by the residents; in 1960, owing to the deterioration of the monument, the marker was set on a new foundation.

=== Neligh Mill ===
Shortly after founding the town, John D. Neligh began building the Neligh Mill in the southern part of town. The original two-story mill was built with bricks made by John J. Crawford, using local clay. Currently, the Neligh Mill is a Nebraska State Historical site.

<text>Orchard is a village in Antelope County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 379 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Orchard was founded in 1880 when the railroad was extended to that point. It took its name from local apple orchards.

==Recreation==
Approximately one block north of Orchard Public School, there is a collection of recreational facilities, including two baseball fields, a municipal pool, a playground area, tennis court, and batting cage.

==Education==
Summerland Public Schools formed in 2020 after absorbing the Orchard school district.

Orchard was formerly in Nebraska Unified School District 1. Around 2007, the villages of Clearwater, Orchard, Royal and Verdigre became the Unified School District #1 and began sharing administration between them. Subsequent to this, in 2009, presumably due to a lack of funds and a lack of student participation on both ends, school rivals, the Orchard Orioles football team, and the Clearwater Cardinals football team, combined to form the O-C Cyclones. After the initial trial year, it was decided that all sports teams between the two schools would combine under the O-C Cyclones banner. The school systems have since combined to form the Clearwater-Orchard Public Schools.

Orchard is served by the Orchard Public Library.

<text>Arthur is a village in, and the county seat of Arthur County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 117 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Arthur was founded in 1913 to be the seat of Arthur County, then just organizing. The town and county were both named for President Chester A. Arthur. Arthur was incorporated as a village in 1944. The first county office was a covered wagon, with a one-room courthouse being built in 1915. A year before that, in the Spring, a general store was constructed, and afterward a newspaper, the first church and the post office were established. A one-room high school was also built in 1914, expanding to two rooms in 1920. In 1916 the Arthur State Bank was founded. Into the 1920s, Arthur continued to be built. The town got electricity in 1926, though most of the county would not have it until the early 1950s.

Then in 1932, the Great Depression struck Arthur, closing its bank, which was not replaced until 1939 with the Arthur County Co-op Credit Association. Following WWII, in 1950 construction of a new, large and modern highschool was completed. A new courthouse was built in 1960-1961. In 1980, the census population was 125.

<text>Harrisburg is a census-designated place in, and the county seat of, Banner County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 100 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Harrisburg, and all of Banner County, were originally part of Cheyenne County and began with a homestead in 1884. A settlement, at first called Randall and then Centropolis, developed around this and neighboring homesteads. In November, 1888, Cheyenne County subdivided into five counties, and the settlement was included in the territory which became Banner County. Its county seat was originally located at Ashford, a few miles northeast. However, in 1889 Charles Schooley, a settler, donated part of his land for the development of a formal town. A migrant being from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania caused the name to be selected.

Because of its central location, Harrisburg became the home base for stagecoach and mail carrier lines in the county, and the county government moved its operations from Ashford in mid-1891. By 1892, Harrisburg had two hotels, two livery stables, a brickwork, a cheese factory, two banks and three newspapers. It was the principal community for the county, which was almost entirely devoted to wheat farming and cattle ranching. In 1951, oil (which had first been discovered in 1919) became the county&#x27;s third commodity.

Harrisburg&#x27;s fortunes rose and fell with the county&#x27;s. The lack of a railroad line for shipping eventually drew the larger farm and ranch houses to the north, while the 1960s routing of Interstate Highway 80 through Kimball brought the removal of other businesses to the south. Other small hamlets in Banner County collapsed as people moved either north or south, or consolidated their activities around Harrisburg. This movement has allowed Harrisburg to flourish into the 21st century, despite its low resident population.

<text>Brewster is a village in and the county seat of Blaine County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 12 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town was laid out in 1884 by George Washington Brewster who had homesteaded the land there. It was named for one of his ancestors, William Brewster, who had arrived in America on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. The community was named the county seat in 1887 after George Washington Brewster offered to build the required buildings. According to town lore, Brewster had expected the state capitol to be located in the community because of its central location.

In 1887 the outlaw D.C.&quot;Doc&quot; Middleton opened a saloon in the community.

Brewster almost became a railhead, when the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad graded a line from Sargent in 1897. The line would have had an intermediate station at Moulton.

Following the 2010 census Brewster became the smallest incorporated county seat in the United States replacing Amidon, North Dakota for the title. Amidon had 26 people in 2000 and Brewster had 29. In the 2010 census Brewster had 17 while Amidon had 20.

The tower collapsed on September 24, 2002, during reconstruction work. Two tower workers, Lawrence A. Sukalec, 59, of Valier, Illinois, and Daniel E. Goff, 25, of Sesser, Illinois, were killed in the process, and three were injured on the ground. The collapse occurred as strengthening measures were being taken so the 30+ year-old tower could accommodate the added weight of digital television transmission facilities. Investigations later found that the contractors neglected to stabilize the tower while original structural components were being replaced with stronger ones.

KDUH resumed full-power broadcasts one year later from a new tower near Angora.

<doc id="123696" wikidata="Q962405" url="?curid=123696" title="Monowi, Nebraska">
<text>Monowi ( ) is an incorporated village in Boyd County, Nebraska, United States. It garnered national and international recognition after the 2010 United States census counted only one resident of the village, Elsie Eiler. Although the 2020 census listed Monowi&#x27;s population as two, this was confirmed to be an example of differential privacy in the census data; Eiler remains the town&#x27;s sole resident.

According to tradition, the name &quot;Monowi&quot; means &quot;flower&quot; in an unidentified Native American language. Monowi was named after the many wildflowers growing at the original site of the village.

==History==

Monowi was platted in 1903, when the Mason, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad was extended to that point. A post office was established in Monowi in 1902 and remained in operation until 1967.

Monowi&#x27;s peak years were in the 1930s, when it had a population of 150. Like many other small communities in the Great Plains, it lost its younger residents to cities that were experiencing growth and offering better jobs.

During the 2000 census, the village had a total population of two; only one married couple, Rudy and Elsie Eiler, lived there. Rudy died in 2004, leaving his wife as the only resident in the village. In this capacity, she acts as mayor, and granted herself a liquor license. She is required to produce a municipal road plan every year in order to secure state funding for the village&#x27;s four street lights.

Although the village is nearly abandoned, it does have a bar called the Monowi Tavern, operated by Eiler for passing travelers and tourists. In addition, Eiler maintains the five-thousand–volume Rudy&#x27;s Library, founded in memory of her late husband.

In 2018, the village was featured in commercials for Arby&#x27;s and Prudential. The village was also used as a starting place for the biggest advertisement poster in the world, which was finished on June 13, 2018.

===Census data===
After the 1990 United States census, Eiler had observed that Monowi&#x27;s population had been miscounted, and contacted radio broadcaster Paul Harvey to publicize the error. Years later, preliminary information from the 2020 census appeared to show that Monowi&#x27;s population increased to two. However, Eiler denied that anyone had moved into the town, and a spokesperson for the United States Census Bureau said that the alleged second resident was actually a form of &quot;noise... add[ed] to the [census] data,&quot; in which some individuals are listed in a bordering tract to protect the anonymity of census respondents.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. The village is located in the far eastern portion of Boyd County, in the northeastern region of Nebraska. It is located between the Niobrara River and the larger Missouri River. The nearest community to Monowi is Lynch, located approximately away. The village is located approximately from Omaha.

==Demographics==

Census data for Monowi highlights its uniqueness, owing to the numerical singularity of its population. As of 2010:
* The total population was one (Born 1935, female, white, named Elsie).
* She was the sole householder, living alone.
* Of the three housing units in Monowi, only hers was occupied.

==Education==
The area is within Boyd County Public Schools. The area was previously within the Lynch Public Schools district in Lynch. The Lynch district consolidated into the Boyd County district in June 2017.

<text>Kearney ( ) is the county seat of Buffalo County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 33,790 in the 2020 census, making it the 5th most populous city in Nebraska. It is home to the University of Nebraska at Kearney. The westward push of the railroad as the Civil War ended gave new birth to the community.

==History==


In the late 1840s, American settlers traveling westward arrived in significant numbers along the Mormon Trail and Overland Trails. This marked the beginning of Kearney&#x27;s role as a crossroads on major east-west transportation arteries. In 1848, to safeguard westward migrants traveling through the region, the US Army established a military fort several miles southeast of the present city. Named after famed frontier military officer Stephen W. Kearny, Fort Kearny would become the namesake of the present city and serve as a stopping-point for gold prospectors, Pony Express riders, and Union Pacific Railroad workers until 1871.

The first permanent settlement in the area was called Dobytown, located southeast of the present-day Kearney. The &quot;e&quot; in Kearney was added by mistake sometime afterwards by postmen who consistently misspelled the town name; eventually the spelling became nomenclature. 

The region expanded in 1866 with the arrival of the Union Pacific Railroad. The fixing of a junction point with the Burlington &amp; Missouri River Railroad in 1871 anticipated the establishment of a townsite in the summer of that year. The city of Kearney was incorporated on December 3, 1873, the townsite being fixed a mille north of the Platte River. In 1874, Kearney was chosen to be the seat of Buffalo County, experiencing great population, economic, and infrastructural expansion in subsequent years that transformed the nascent city into the local business, education, and transportation center it remains to this day. This boom would be sustained through the next twenty-years, fueled by a post-Civil War period of frenzied economic expansion and wealth generation (Gilded Age) that was transforming the whole nation. Enterprising investors poured into the burgeoning community from the East and elsewhere, hoping to enrich themselves through ambitious speculative development schemes that, more often than not, turned out to be ill-conceived and economically unsustainable. An irrigation canal, electric street railway, and a five-story opera house were some of the projects to ultimately make it off the drawing board. These flush times would grind to a sudden halt as a result of the agricultural depression and economic crisis of the early 1890s.

In 1912, the Catholic diocese of Kearney was centered here. The diocese was suppressed in 1917, with the creation of the diocese of Grand Island. In 1997, the historical diocese of Kearney began to be used as a titular see by the Catholic Church.

<doc id="123709" wikidata="Q2489372" url="?curid=123709" title="Pleasanton, Nebraska">
<text>Pleasanton is a village in Buffalo County in the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States. At the 2010 census, its population was 341.

Pleasanton was platted in 1890 when the Union Pacific railroad was extended to that point. It got its name from its location in the Pleasant Valley of the Loup River. Pleasanton was incorporated as a village in 1894.

==History==
The village was platted in April 1890 when the Union Pacific constructed a branch line of railroad, the Omaha and Republican Valley Railway, from Boelus in Howard County through Ravenna and on to Pleasant Valley. The village was a terminus station for the branch line of railroad located on the north side of the South Loup River called Pleasant Valley. This was also the location of an early settlement called Peters&#x27; Bridge. The Peters family was one of the first settlers to the area when they constructed and operated the bridge. Peters&#x27; Bridge was the location of a station on the stagecoach and freight line that went north with supplies. A post office was located in an area called South Loup, near the bridge. This area of section 35 of the Loup Township was previously known as Riverview, when the post office was established in 1883. James Hunter became the first postmaster of Riverview. The first regularly scheduled train arrived to the town on March 1, 1890. Local businesses and buildings were quickly constructed at the crossroads. The village schoolhouse was constructed on the south side of the South Loup River. This location served the town of Pleasanton until 1907 when an ice-jam clogged the river and backed the water up into the school. In 1909 a brick schoolhouse was built on top of the hill, above the flood plain. The flood was first of many disasters the village of Pleasanton has endured in its history. The disasters continued when a cyclone occurred in 1890, three fires burned parts of the town between 1892 and 1894, and two major floods occurred in 1924 and 1947. The 1947 flood washed out the railroad tracks that were responsible for the creation of the village. The village went through a growing spurt in the 1970s where 40 new homes were built.

==Pleasanton Public School==
The school has been in operation since 1890. It is categorized as a class D2 School by the Nebraska School Activities Association, which organizes high schools on a scale from A to D, with D2 being the smallest schools.

==Railroad depot==
The Pleasanton Railroad Depot located in the center of town was built in 1890. It was constructed during a time where an extension of Burlington Northern and Union Pacific railroads were built in an effort to reach the Black Hills quickly. In 2005 the village board deemed the building a liability, and made plans to tear it down. The Pleasanton High School chapter of Future Business Leaders of America made it their mission to save the deteriorating building. It took eight years of grants and fundraisers to raise the money and renovate the depot.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

The Board consists of Brian Paitz, Brian Pritchard, Keith Rasmussen, Dean Smith, and Randy Tolles. The chairperson of the board is Dean Smith, who is also the elected mayor.

==Old Settlers==
Old Settlers is the village&#x27;s annual weekend celebration that takes place on the first weekend in June. The weekend event consists of local businesses sponsoring activities for the residents of Pleasanton to participate in. The celebration starts with a parade, Fun Run &amp; Walk, carnival, 3-on-3 basketball tournament, volleyball tournament, and a community theater play on Saturday. Sunday consists of a hamburger feed, softball tournament, and paintball tournament. The celebration has a general theme for the weekend and floats in the parade are decorated accordingly. The celebration resumed its festivities in 2003 after a 13-year hiatus when the village celebrated its centennial anniversary in 1990. Old Settlers is organized and ran by the Pleasanton Community Improvement Committee.

==Parks==

===Rosalia Klein Park===
Klein Park was built in 2008 and funded by a Nebraska Arboretum Grant and grant from the Pleasanton Community Foundation. Community members volunteered to build the park to beautify the entrance into the town. The park consists of a gazebo, sidewalks, seating, and a mural of 1900 Pleasanton.

===Splash Park===

The park serves as a combination of a playground and a fountain for the children and residents of the community. The park was completed in 2010 and was funded by a grant from the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.

==Churches==
There are four churches in Pleasanton. The Pleasanton United Methodist Church was established in 1899. Grace Lutheran Church was established in 1906. St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in 1909, and then replaced with a new church in 1960. Pleasanton Evangelical Free Church was established in 1982.

<doc id="123713" wikidata="Q3288895" url="?curid=123713" title="Shelton, Nebraska">
<text>Shelton is a village in Buffalo and Hall counties, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Kearney, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,059 at the 2010 census. It is located west of Grand Island along both the Union Pacific Railroad and U.S. Route 30. Nebraska Link 10-D connects Shelton with Interstate 80.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

The downtown business district is situated near the banks of the Wood River and the historic Lincoln Highway (now U.S. Highway 30) passes through Shelton.

==History==
Shelton, evolving from Wood River Centre, is one of the older communities in Nebraska. The first European settler to live in the area was a Mormon by the name of Joseph Johnson in 1858. His store, blacksmithery, wagon repair shop, tintype gallery, bakery, place where meals could be obtained, and printing office served early pioneers. The &quot;Huntsman&#x27;s Echo&quot;, his publication, was the first newspaper west of Omaha and was established in April 1860. His establishment (Johnson&#x27;s Ranche) found itself as an important point of supply serving Mormons and other travelers on the Council Bluffs Road.

Prior to service by the railroad, The Great Western Stage Company established a stage station at Wood River Center in 1860 to serve its Fort Kearny route. The Union Pacific Railroad came to the area in 1866; with additional settlers, the need to establish government was realized. Patrick Walsh, Martin Slattery, and a Sergeant Cody petitioned the governor to organize Buffalo County in 1869. Wood River Centre (Shelton) was selected through election to be the county seat. Within a year, the seat was moved to Gibbon.

Patrick Walsh, the community postman, wrote the Postmaster General in 1873 with the plea to change the name of Wood River Centre to Shelton to avoid confusion with Wood River, a community to the east. The post office name was changed from Wood River Center to Shelton on February 3, 1873. Shelton held the name of Wood River Center from 1860 to about 1873. No further correspondence about the naming of Shelton is recorded. The name, Shelton, is derived from the name of an auditor for the Union Pacific Railroad, Nathan Shelton.

 The original townsite was surveyed from the homestead farm of Patrick Walsh, followed by a survey from the Union Pacific Railway Company. It was 1876 before the Union Pacific established a station. With incorporation in 1882, the community grew and was home to &quot;The Shelton Clipper&quot; formerly &quot;The Shelton Clarion&quot;, several banks, and a community school. As early as 1866, people of the Shelton area organized together to form the first schoolhouse in Buffalo County. By 1876, a new school district was organized; it was legally known as No. 19 in Buffalo County. In January 1908, the community library was officially organized as the Shelton Public Library with a village tax being levied for its support. A Carnegie Library building was funded on April 7, 1913.

The population of Shelton has been relatively consistent since its early years, always maintaining a population around 1,000 individuals. The population of Shelton in 1910 was 1,005.

<text>Decatur is a village in Burt County, Nebraska, United States, adjacent to the upper Missouri River. The population was 481 at the 2010 census. This town is named after one of its incorporators, Stephen Decatur. It developed around a trading post established by Colonel Peter Sarpy, the namesake for Sarpy County in the state.

==History==
The area was long occupied by the Omaha Native Americans, who settled along the creeks and river Explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark passed through the area in 1804 as their expedition traveled via the upper Missouri River on their way to and from the Pacific Coast, in their exploration of the Louisiana Purchase.

The first European settler in the area was a man named Woods, who settled at the mouth of Wood Creek (his namesake) in 1837. Stephen Decatur arrived in the area in 1841. A former schoolteacher in New Jersey and New York, he had abandoned his wife and two children when he migrated to the West. Here he changed his name, dropping his former surname of &quot;Bross.&quot; His farm was called Decatur Springs, after a spring which supplied water to the village for the next century.

In 1854, the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs purchased 300,000 acres of land from the Omaha, including the area which is now Decatur. The town of Decatur was incorporated in 1856 under the name &quot;The Decatur Townsite &amp; Ferry Company.&quot; The other incorporators included Thomas Whiteacre, T. H. Hineman, George Mason, and Herman Glass. Peter Sarpy helped lay out the town, which developed around his Indian trading post at the mouth of Wood Creek. He also owned Fontenelle&#x27;s Post and is the namesake for Sarpy County.

The patents for the town were granted by the legislature on May 1, 1862. Following the dissolution of the Decatur Townsite and Ferry Company, the town was renamed Decatur Village in 1858.

<text>Lyons is a city in Burt County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 851 in the 2010 census. The city is named after its founder.

==History==
The first settlers of Lyons came in the summer of 1866. The fertile soil of the Logan Valley, combined with the commercial promise provided by access to the railroad after 1881, assured the life of the town. Incorporated in 1884, the village was named for Waldo Lyon, a prominent citizen upon whose land the plots were laid out. Residents have continued to abide by a provision in Lyons&#x27; deed stipulating that liquor not be sold within the town at risk of forfeit of the property.

The Lyons Roller Mill was erected in 1869. The three-story structure was powered by water from a dam built across Logan Creek just west of the town, and was in operation until 1931.

Many of the buildings of the town are constructed of brick manufactured in a brickyard which began operation in 1878. The swimming pool sits in the depression from which the clay was taken.

One of the finest trotting tracks in the country opened in 1891. Just one-fourth mile west of Lyons named the Kite Track. Famous horses broke world records and won large purses on this kite-shaped race track before hard times ended racing after 1893.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Lyons is on U.S. Route 77, south of the Omaha Indian Reservation and west of the Missouri River.

=== Center for Rural Affairs ===
Lyons is home to the Center for Rural Affairs, a private non-profit organization. The organization&#x27;s mission statement is: &quot;Establish strong rural communities, social and economic justice, environmental stewardship, and genuine opportunity for all while engaging people in decisions that affect the quality of their lives and the future of their communities.&quot; It was established in Walthill, Nebraska in 1973, and moved to Lyons in 2004.

=== Storefront Theater ===
The Storefront Theater is located on Main Street in Lyons. It is one of four projects that are a part of the Byway of Art project created through a $200,000 ArtPlace America grant awarded to the Center for Rural Affairs. The Byway of Art project was created by former Lyons resident Adele Phillips and conceptual artist Matthew Mazzotta. The Storefront Theater creates a seating and performance area on the street. When not in use the structure appears to be a typical storefront. However, what appears to be a standard building consists of a false facade that lowers down toward the street and over the sidewalk. Bleachers behind the storefront theater pull out for seating. The Storefront Theater was selected as part of the Americans for the Arts 2016 Public Art Network Year in Review program.

<text>Abie is a village in Butler County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 69 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The book Butler County Nebraska History records that the first settlers in the area were &quot;Yankees&quot;. When the Yankees moved out, the German people moved in. They too left to find more level ground. The Czech immigrants first went to Linwood, then to Abie. A wagon train of 13 families came to Nebraska from Spillville, IA arriving in July 1869. Abie was platted in 1877. Czech people organized their reading and dramatic clubs shortly after their arrival, and many older people still speak Czech. 
The applicant for the post office, Charles &quot;Yankee&quot; Stevens, successfully petitioned to have the post office named for his wife, Abigail Stevens.
Stevens was postmaster of Abie from 1878 to 1888. The Rural Free Delivery was installed in Abie in 1905 with John O. Hasik as carrier. T.B. Semrad succeeded Hasik on April 1, 1940. He carried the mail on that route until July 15, 1945, when it was consolidated with the Linwood route. 
The first railroad, The Chicago Northwestern was built in Abie in 1887 at which time the old settlement was moved south three-quarters of a mile to the present location in order to be nearer to the railroad. The new village was laid out by the Western Townsite Co. in July 1887. The Catholic cemetery stands in the spot where Abie was originally settled. The railroad started a boom in the area which did not end until 1928, although there were a few periods of hard times.

The boom years lasted until 1928. In this time, Abie grew and was quite a business town. There were two general stores, a meat market, hardware-implement business, two grain elevators, two lumber yards, two blacksmith shops, a livery stable and dray service. Later on there were two service garages, a trucking firm, a bulk oil agency, two taverns, a barbershop and a beauty shop.

The Bank was built in 1904.
The first school was built in 1877 but was replaced by a larger building in 1905. Abie&#x27;s school has since closed and is now home to Abie&#x27;s Place, a small town cafe serving up Czech meals and baking.
The Abie milling company was also incorporated in 1905. They manufactured the White Lily and Pride of Nebraska wheat flours and Rye Flours. The Abie Flour was known for its high standard of quality and its use exclusively in the area. The flour was also marketed in Omaha, Fremont, Schuyler, Howells, Prague and other surrounding cities and towns.
The city hall was built in 1912.
The Parish Hall was built in 1923.
Ted Sokol Hall was built in 1924.
The Church was built in 1918.
The Ted Sokol organization was started in about 1921. This is a group that teaches gymnastics and Czech dances to young people.
The Sokol Auditorium was dedicated in June 1923. It served as a community center until it closed in 2017. The building still stands but is no longer available for activities.

Despite a few fires and floods in the past. Abie has maintained a large number of its historic structures. These were surveyed in 1980 by the Nebraska State Historical Society. Despite the loss of the railroad in 1962, the local elevator and a few Abie businesses continue to operate.

==Name==
The origin of the name of David City is disputed. One source claims that David City was named after the first Governor of Nebraska, David Butler. Another source says that David City was named in honor of Phoebe Miles, whose maiden name was either &quot;David&quot; or &quot;Davids,&quot; because she had deeded a large tract of land for the townsite on which the courthouse now sits. A third source indicates that David City may have been named for a &quot;Mr. Davids,&quot; a relative of William Miles, who was part owner of the townsite, and that the &quot;s&quot; at the end of &quot;Davids&quot; was dropped for convenience. Because details are unclear, this third explanation may be just another version of the second explanation. On its official website, David City claims the second of these explanations as the official explanation of its name.

==History==
An attempt to settle the area was first made in 1857, on the banks of Skull Creek, a half-mile from current-day Linwood. A school was established in 1865, and a postmaster for the settlement, originally named Skull Creek, was appointed in 1868. It was later renamed Linwood for the linden trees growing near the creek. Linwood was incorporated as a village in 1888, shortly after the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad built a line through the settlement.

<text>West Pleasant View is an unincorporated community and a census-designated place (CDP) located in and governed by Jefferson County, Colorado, United States. The CDP is a part of the Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population of the West Pleasant View CDP was 4,327 at the United States Census 2020. The Pleasant View Metropolitan District provides services. The Golden post office (Zip code 80401) serves the area.

==History==
West Pleasant View traces its origins in the Colorado Gold Rush, when in 1860 George Pullman and several partners assembled claims to create the Cold Spring Ranch, comprising most of its present land area. With a hewn log Stage station built by Pullman at the southeast side of the junction of today&#x27;s South Golden and Mt. Vernon Roads, the ranch served many area residents and travelers to at this important crossroads to and from the gold fields, served by Wells Fargo and other stagecoach companies. Making enough money on this and other ventures to realize his sleeper railcar dream, Pullman returned east in the mid-1860s, and the ranch continued as an important way station through subsequent proprietors including three generations of Jefferson County Sheriffs.

In 1891 the Denver, Lakewood and Golden Railroad, in 1904 changed to Denver and Intermountain Railroad, began rail mass transit to the area and soon it began to be subdivided. In 1893 the Denver Rifle Club purchased five acres at its northeast end, which in time attracted the attention of the Colorado National Guard, which acquired property there and created Rifle Range in 1903, since built up to become the Camp George West Historic District. Residential development began in 1908 when the Pleasant View Development and Investment Company was created by ranch property owners D.J. Myerpeter, George C. Gilman and E.E. Sherwood. with Cecelia Prentiss building Pleasant View&#x27;s first house. Fellow Pleasant View pioneer Susan Hubbard Martin, a University of Denver graduate in music, vowed &quot;Pleasant View shall have a church of its very own&quot; and Pleasant View Community Church was dedicated on February 8, 1931. West Colfax Avenue was built through Pleasant View in 1937 as a Works Progress Administration project, and many businesses built up along South Golden Road and Colfax that served as highways to and from the mountains. In October 1948 the Pleasant View Metropolitan District was created to serve the area&#x27;s firefighting and parks needs including the Pleasant View Fire Department, and in 1951 Pleasant View Elementary School was built, spearheaded by the noted Golden educator Roger Quincy Mitchell.

Pleasant View today has a significant collection of historic landmarks spanning from throughout its unique history. Listed upon the National Register of Historic Places are the Camp George West Historic District and the Romano Residence (16300 South Golden Road), built in 1926 by CNG Quartermaster Leopold Rundstein and owned nearly a century by the Romano family of Italian heritage. Next door stands the Golden Market (16350 South Golden Road), built when Hungarian immigrant Emery John Barlock moved the Golden Cash Store from downtown Golden to here, soon acquired and long run by Samuel and Albina Romano. Rock Rest (16005 Mt. Vernon Road), its historic dance hall and wayside tavern, was built at the west side of the historic crossroads junction in 1921 by CNG Quartermaster and state Representative Bert M. Lake, who ran it with wife Daisie. It is prominently associated with noted African-American violinist, band and orchestra leader George Morrison, who played there many times from the 1920s-1950s, and had the house band of Rock Rest in at least 1926, 1928, 1945 and 1958. However he is not to be confused with the tavern&#x27;s contemporaneous neighbor of the same given name, early western movie star Pete Morrison whose ranch adjoined to the northwest. Pleasant View Community Church&#x27;s chapel, built in 1931, stands at 805 McIntyre Street, and Pleasant View Elementary School stands at 15920 West 10th Avenue, now home to Free Horizon Montessori School. One of the oldest remaining auto lodging courts in the area stands at 16100 South Golden Road, originally the Old Homestead, created in 1925 when Golden&#x27;s first building, the Boston Company store made of hewn logs, was moved there to become a restaurant and accompanied by a service station (which tiny building still stands in front and is the area&#x27;s oldest standalone gas station building) and lodging units (behind), which continued long past when the restaurant and grocery burned in 1942. Pleasant View and the surrounding area have long been noticeable for their interesting collection of native stone buildings, often built in American Craftsman types of designs, which have no common owner or architect, but are their own local architecture movement of the 1910s-1960s, which originated in 1913 with the Colorado National Guard Armory in Golden. The Pullman House, although dismantled in 1965, does still exist as logs and other components stored in the Golden area.

Historic businesses and institutions that continue to operate in Pleasant View include the Columbine Cafe at 15630 South Golden Road (built in 1933 by Greek immigrant Mike Hatzis and still owned by family), Rock Rest, Calvary Baptist Church at 17050 South Golden Road (built in 1955 as Calvary Bible Church), Eggers Lapidary at 16950 South Golden Road (established in 1972 by Verne and Vergene Eggers), Stevinson Chevrolet (established in Golden in 1935 by Ralph Ashton), Ace Liquor at 16265 South Golden Road (established in 1946), Mountain View Motel at 14825 West Colfax Avenue (built 1966), and the Sinclair Service Station at 15495 West Colfax Avenue (built 1967), the oldest remaining operational station of over 150 years of way stations and over 100 years of gas stations Pleasant View has known.

The CDP was first defined in the 2000 U.S. Census. In the 1990 U.S. Census, the area was statistically counted in the Applewood CDP.

==Geography==
West Pleasant View is bordered to the west by Golden, to the east by Lakewood, and to the north by unincorporated Applewood. Interstate 70, U.S. Route 6, and U.S. Route 40 (West Colfax Avenue) all cross the community from west to east. Downtown Denver is to the east.

<text>Surprise is a village in southwestern Butler County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 43 at the 2010 census, and 37 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Surprise lies on the Big Blue River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
==History==
White people began settling southwestern Butler County in about 1866. In 1881, George Miller built a gristmill on the Big Blue River. He was pleasantly surprised to discover that so much waterpower was available so close to the river&#x27;s headwaters, and this led him to name the mill &quot;Surprise&quot;. Businesses and homes were established near the mill; and in 1883, a post office was established under the name &quot;Surprise&quot;. The town plat was registered in 1884. In 1887, the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad established a depot in Surprise, resulting in further expansion of local businesses.

In 1913, chautauquas began to be offered at Chautauqua Park on the river. In the same year, the Surprise Opera House was built. Events held at the latter included local gatherings, lectures, musical performances, and moving pictures. The opera house&#x27;s role in the community declined after about 1917, as increasing automobile ownership enabled residents to attend events at larger facilities in David City, Seward, and Osceola. Chautauquas continued to be held into the early 1930s; at their peak, the population of Surprise expanded to 1,500 during its week-long Chautauqua Show. The last performance at the opera house took place in 1954; the building is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

The population of Surprise reached its peak of about 350 in the early 1920s. Its businesses included a brick factory and two grain elevators; it was an important shipping point for livestock, and exported ice cut from the millpond in the winter.

In 1924, Surprise&#x27;s school was expanded to provide K–12 education. This continued until 1953, when Surprise and four other districts consolidated their high schools. The Surprise school shut down and assets were liquidated around 2000.

The railroad line through Surprise was abandoned in 1942. The Surprise post office was discontinued in 1988.

<text>Louisville is a city in northern Cass County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 1,319 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Louisville, Nebraska traces its beginning back to 1857, only three years after the territory formed. It is situated in Northern Cass County on the Platte River, 18 miles west of Plattsmouth and the Missouri River.

The first settler in the area was Gardner Powers, a Native trader, who bought out a soldier&#x27;s claim and built a dugout and later a log cabin at about Third and Mill streets where the Christian Church would later stand.

Powers had great hopes for the community and on Jan. 1, 1857, established a post office at what he called Louisville.

Exactly why he chose that name is uncertain. Some say it was the town where his fur trading company was located, others that it was named for the community in Kentucky and least popular for a Mr. Lewis, now lost in antiquity, who operated a mill somewhere in the area.

That August, Powers formed the Louisville Town Association and filed a plat. Unfortunately, absolutely nothing transpired.

In 1863, Capt. J.T.A. Hoover arrived in Cass County after serving two years in the &quot;late unpleasantness,&quot; as the Civil War was sometimes called, with the 58th Ohio. First hoping to farm a 320 acre tract he purchased, his plans were interrupted with the discovery of white clay on the property.

Seeing a commercial opportunity, Hoover set up a pottery works.

In 1865 he was elected to the territorial legislature and in 1867 re-established the Louisville Post Office, which had been forfeited by Powers through inaction, with himself as Postmaster.

From 1857 on, literally no structures had been built around Powers&#x27; original 1857 cabin but because of the proximity of the Platte River, Hoover began to work on the Burlington Rail Road and Missouri River Railroad to build here and even proffered a $500 gift to help build a depot and siding.

The railroad, though probably not materially swayed by the cash grant, did build through Louisville in 1870. With the promise surrounding the railroad, Hoover built a general store and post office. As it began to look like a real community might actually develop, he also had a new survey drawn that showed the Burlington tracks along the north edge of town, parallel to the Platte River, with the depot just Northwest of Cherry and First streets between North and South Depot Streets. At this point Hoover owned about a third of the roughly 50 square block town.

In 1874 the first hotel was built and in 1876 Huber and Sons Louisville Mills opened at the foot of Main Street. This steam-powered mill had two run of burrs that were capable of turning out 15 barrels of &quot;Bone and Sinew&quot; brand flour per day.

Hoover then incorporated his fledgling pottery company as the Louisville Stone Ware Company in June 1878 with a total capitalization of $5,000. In 1879, when Louisville had a population of about 250, his company was listed as &quot;the only stone-ware manufactory in the state of Nebraska.&quot;

By 1881 the pottery works had a capacity of &quot;12,000 to 15,000 gallons per week.&quot;

In 1881 Louisville had a sudden burst of growth as the Burlington completed a bridge over the Platte and the Missouri Pacific Railroad arrived with its tracks cutting through town on a north/south line paralleling Mill Creek.

A depot was built at about Third and Mill streets and elevators and stockyards just to the South.

By 1882 the Congregational Church had been joined by the Methodist and Baptist, and the Christian Brethren and Union Sabbath Schools began holding services.

The now-prosperous incorporated city of Louisville boasted a population of 450, a total area of 200 acres, four general stores, two hotels, three druggist, two groceries and many smaller prosperous merchants but no bank until the following year.

The next big event was the opening of an auto and wagon bridge over the Platte allowing their trading area to greatly increase.

In 1927 the Ash Grove Cement Company of Kansas City opened a new factory on the site of the old Murphy Quarry grounds and the town&#x27;s economy boomed.

Ash Grove now owns nearly 4,000 acres of land and quarries in the Louisville area, producing about a million tons of cement annually.

<doc id="123756" wikidata="Q754178" url="?curid=123756" title="Lake Pocotopaug, Connecticut">
<text>Lake Pocotopaug is an unincorporated village and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of East Hampton in Middlesex County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 4,901, up from 3,436 in 2010.

It is named for the large local lake, which for years has been a popular resort area. The lake is surrounded by numerous homes. Most are year-round residences, although some summer cottages dot the shore. It is especially noted for two islands in its center, separated by a narrow, shallow strait (both of which have cabins).

==The lake==
Lake Pocotopaug, at , is large, but many other lakes in Connecticut are larger. The largest by far, is Candlewood Lake at .

The lake&#x27;s name reportedly comes from the local Wangunk Indian language for &quot;Lake with Pierced Islands&quot; or &quot;Divided Pond&quot;. According to local legend, some time long before the area was settled by whites, the tribe living there felt they were being cursed by their irritable Great Spirit. To try to appease him, the main chief agreed to sacrifice his daughter, who willingly threw herself into the lake and drowned. The tribe&#x27;s shamans announced that never again would an Indian be killed on the lake.

The Wangunk were also said to have hunted on Spellman&#x27;s Point, now a quaint street lined with cottages, using loud noises to scare the animals to the end of the peninsula, and thereby an effective way to gather food. However, in the mid-to-late 1800s it was sold for a sack of beans to the &quot;Bay point&quot; society.

Sears Park is located at the lake and has various swimming, boating and recreational facilities for residents.

In recent years the lake has become a place of ecological study due to the large-scale algae blooms that started appearing in 2000. Tests have shown that increasing watershed land development and fertilizer use are causing issues. A town-sanctioned Lake Commission and the Friends of Lake Pocotopaug are two organizations concentrating on improvement ideas.

In late spring and summer 2020, a rehabilitation project began, focusing on pumping fresh air into the lake bottom at multiple sites around the lake. These were added throughout the lake in a stepwise process. Additionally, a &quot;bioblast&quot; treatment with favorable bacterial organisms was completed in early August 2020. Within a single season, water clarity increased and has been steadily improving. This successful intervention has interrupted nearly two decades of regular summer algae blooms, with no significant bloom occurring in 2020. Dramatic improvement in the lake&#x27;s water quality has resulted. How long term this improvement will be sustained remains to be seen. 

The lake has scattered rock hazards, including one marked by a small memorial lighthouse in its southeast portion. &quot;Claudia&#x27;s Light - 2006&quot; is identified on the base. Although its light is currently nonfunctional, the lighthouse has undergone a restoration and repainting by good samaritans.

==Geography==

<text>Branford Center is a neighborhood and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Branford, Connecticut, United States. The CDP encompasses the traditional town center area (roughly the area bounded by U.S. Route 1, the Amtrak railroad tracks, and the Branford River) and the area known as Branford Point (the portion of the CDP south of the railroad tracks). The population of the CDP (including Branford Point) was 5,819 at the 2010 census.


==Historic district==
The Branford Center Historic District was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The historic district represents the area of the traditional town center and excludes Branford Point. The designated portion is an irregularly-shaped area that includes 557 contributing buildings out of a total of 706 buildings in the district, including garages, carriage houses, and other structures. It includes two other contributing sites: the Center Cemetery and the Saint Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery. The district boundaries were drawn to exclude modern construction such as the Branford High School and to exclude older buildings that did not retain their &quot;historic architectural integrity.&quot;

Architectural styles represented in the Branford Center Historic District include Greek Revival architecture, Queen Anne architecture, and Colonial Revival architecture, Italianate architecture, Federal architecture, Gothic Revival architecture, Second Empire architecture, Colonial architecture, Tudor Revival architecture, and Bungalow architecture. These are mostly vernacular buildings. Of buildings designed by professional architects, the most significant is the &quot;classically inspired, monumental 1893 James Blackstone Memorial Library,&quot; designed by Solon Spencer Beman of Chicago. The library incorporates Tennessee marble and features a domed, octagonal rotunda. According to the historic district nomination, &quot;relatively little remains in Branford Center that evokes its distant 17th- and early 18th century past.&quot; The district instead includes remnants of late 19th and early 20th century industrial, commercial, and residential history.

Industry is represented in buildings of the Malleable Iron Fittings Company and the Atlantic Wire Company. Government buildings include the Branford Town Hall, from 1857, a Greek Revival building. Religious institution buildings in the district include:
*the First Baptist Church, from 1840, at 975 Main Street
*St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s rectory from c. 1925 (contributing) and church from 1974 (non-contributing)
*First Congregational Church, at 1009 Main Street, a brick and stone building from 1843 in Greek Revival style, with Italianate addition from later in the century

==Geography==
As defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, the boundaries of the Center extend from the Branford River north along Short Beach Road (Connecticut Route 142) to U.S. Route 1 (West Main Street), then northeast along Route 1 (becoming North Main Street) to Cedar Street, north on Cedar Street to Interstate 95, and east (northbound) on I-95 to the Branford River, which forms the entire southeastern boundary of the CDP.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP (which includes Branford Point in addition to the center) has a total area of , of which is land and , or 10.14%, is water.

===Branford Green===

The green is typical of a traditional New England town, and serves as Branford&#x27;s social, commercial, and governmental nerve center. It is home to many small stores, restaurants, and coffee houses, (including perennial favorites like Ashley&#x27;s Ice Cream and Common Grounds) and hosts concerts and other events. Notable annual events include the Branford Festival, and the used book sale held by the Friends of the Blackstone Memorial Library.

The Branford Green is lined with churches as well as the town hall; other government facilities (such as the Branford Police Department and United States Post Office), are located on nearby Harrison Avenue. A memorial to Branford&#x27;s contributions during the American Civil War is to the right of the town hall. The historic Blackstone Library is situated in the western portion of the center. It also contains five schools: St. Mary School (grades K-8), John B. Sliney (grades K-4), Mary T. Murphy, Mary Tisko and Branford High School (grades 9–12).

<text>Plattsmouth is a city and county seat of Cass County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 6,620 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the mouth of the Platte River, just north of what is now Main Street Plattsmouth, on July 21, 1804.

Plattsmouth first appeared in 1854 as &quot;the Barracks&quot;, a trading post established by Sam Martin, owner of the Platteville ferry in neighboring Mills County, Iowa, ferryman Wheatley Mickelwait, and Glenwood, Iowa attorney and politician Colonel Joseph Longworthy Sharp. The community was renamed Plattsmouth for its location at the mouth of the Platte River, and was incorporated on March 15, 1855.

The organization of the city under the charter of March 1855 was effected December 29, 1856, by the election of Wheatley Mickelwait to the Mayoralty, and Enos Williams, W. M. Slaughter and Jacob Vallery, Aldermen. This Council met and proceeded to business on January 29, 1857, their first ordinance, approved by the Mayor March 2, 1857, levying a tax of one-half of 1 per cent on all taxable property within the corporate limits of the city of Plattsmouth, the amount collected to be expended in the improvement of the streets and alleys and steamboat landings at and in the city. On December 7, 1857, the Council voted each member an annual salary of $100, being something over $16 apiece for each session held during the year. This is a noticeable fact, in view of the action taken by the succeeding Council on December 30, 1858, in ordaining that the Mayor and Alderman receive for their services during that year the sum of 5 cents each, payable in city scrip; the Assessor, Recorder and Treasurer being paid $25 apiece for the same term.

<text>Weeping Water is a city in Cass County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 1,029 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The name of the stream running through Weeping Water is &quot;Nigahoe&quot; in Oto and Omaha, meaning &quot;rustling water,&quot; in reference to the sound of the water running over the low falls. This was mistaken by the French to be &quot;Nihoage&quot;, meaning &quot;water weeping.&quot; This error was recorded in French as &quot;L&#x27;Eau qui Pleure&quot;, meaning &quot;the water that weeps.&quot; This was later translated into English as its current name, Weeping Water. The village of Nehawka, also in Cass County, is an anglicization of &quot;Nigahoe&quot;, the original name of the stream in Weeping Water.

Weeping Water was platted in 1867. Weeping Water was incorporated as a village in 1870, and as a city in 1888.

=== Legend ===
Debates over the origin of the name have existed since at least the early twentieth century. Regardless of whether the legend originates from Native American sources or was simply created to explain the mistranslation of the Native American name for the stream, the legend has become an important piece of Nebraska folklore.

According to American folklorist Louise Pound, the first written reference to the legend of Weeping Water is found in the 800-line poem &quot;The Weeping Water&quot; by Orsamus Charles Dake, published in a book of poetry called &quot;Nebraska Legends and Other Poems&quot; in 1871. Dake&#x27;s poem is prefaced with a disclaimer that &quot;The Weeping Water&quot; was one of two poems that Dake &quot;developed.&quot;

Dake&#x27;s poem is also preceded by a paragraph summarizing the legend which reads:The Omaha and Otoe Indians, being at war, chanced to meet on their common hunting ground south of the Platte River in Nebraska. A fierce battle ensued, in which all the male warriors of both tribes being slain, the women and children came upon the battle-field and sat down and wept. From the fountain of their tears arose and ever flows the little stream known as the Ne-hawka or the Weeping Water.The poem includes details and dialogue that Dake likely invented, such as the main narrative thrust of the poem, a story of forbidden love between an Otoe man and the daughter of the Omaha chief. According to Pound, the words spoken by the characters in the poem are not so much dialogue but rather &quot;[l]ofty speeches of the Homeric and Virgilian type&quot; which Pound attributes to Dake&#x27;s classical training and tenure as an English professor. Pound suggests that it is most likely, based on the preface and summary he provides with the poem, that Dake took inspiration from a preexisting folktale, though whether the legend was genuinely of Native American origin remains undetermined.

<text>North Grosvenordale ( ) is a village and census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Thompson in Windham County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 1,530 at the 2010 census. The core of the village is listed as the North Grosvenordale Mill Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic area around the cotton mill was listed in 1993 and is located on Riverside Drive (Route 12), Buckley Hill Road, Floral Avenue, Market Lane, and Marshall, Central, River, and Holmes Streets.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 5.8 km (2.2 mi2), all land. It is located in central Thompson, on the banks of the French River. The main road passing through the village is Connecticut Route 12, which roughly parallels the river&#x27;s north–south course.

==History==
North Grosvenordale was the site of early small textile mills, probably erected in the early years of the 19th century. The mill located here remained relatively small until after the American Civil War, when it and the associated water privileges were purchased by William Grosvenor, an investor from Providence, Rhode Island. Grosvenor also purchased a second mill further south, where he built a large new mill in 1868, calling that village Grosvenordale. When he built the large brick mill standing here in 1872, he renamed this village North Grosvenordale. This mill produced fine cotton fabrics, and was one of the longest-lived and most successful textile businesses in northeastern Connecticut.

Grosvenor also built significant tracts of worker housing on either side of the river. Most of these are multiple-family buildings with vernacular Greek Revival style. They were occupied in clusters by different groups of immigrant workers, giving rise to neighborhood names such as &quot;Little Canada&quot; and &quot;Swede Village&quot;. The company also built some higher-quality single-family houses at the north end of the village, which were probably occupied by skilled specialists and supervisors. The mills operated until 1954, and have been adapted to other industrial uses. The mill and surrounding company-related resources (an area of about with more than 100 buildings), was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

<text>Coleridge is a village in Cedar County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 537 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Coleridge was platted in 1883 when the railroad was extended to that point. It was named for Lord John Coleridge, the Lord Chief Justice of England, who was then paying a visit to the United States.

Mr. Norris and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway failed to reach agreement for a right of way through his town of Norris in 1883. Thus, the railroad was built two miles west of Norris, and lots began selling in what would become the town of Coleridge, approximately three miles west and one mile north of Norris. By early 1885, many of Norris’ businesses had moved to Coleridge. A Cedar County Plat Map (2) showed Norris still having 16 lots at its original location in 1899. The Norris School (District 30), organized March 16, 1880, was dissolved and merged with Coleridge District 41 in 1959. The Norris Cemetery is located outside of Coleridge, one mile east and ¾ mile north of the former city of Norris.

On June 23, 2003, on the 2003 South Dakota tornado outbreak, a devastating F4 tornado damaged or destroyed several homes and farms, unfortunately 1 person was killed. This F4 is overshadowed by the Manchester F4 of the same day.

==History==
Magnet was platted in 1893 when the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway was extended to that point. Magnet was so named by its founder B. E. Smith, who hoped to attract settlers to the region &quot;as the magnet attracts iron&quot;.

===Town motto and disasters===
Magnet&#x27;s motto: &quot;Magnet: The town too tough to die!&quot; came from a variety of disasters that have struck the town over the course of its history. In February 1925 a fire burned one block of Main Street. The first tornado of two to strike Magnet happened on June 18, 1937. It tore through the town, destroying many businesses and homes. Thousands of people came to survey the damage on the Sunday following the storm. Over the summer of 1937 the town was cleaned up and through the help of neighboring towns, buildings and farms were restored.

The second tornado struck Magnet on May 6, 1975 at 2:45 pm. The devastating tornado ripped through the town, destroying 2 homes and heavily damaging many more. A Carhart Lumber truck from Randolph came into town, bringing a load of plywood sheets. They were used for temporary repairs to protect damaged homes from the elements. The town was without lights and water, so the fire department from the neighboring town of Wausa brought in emergency generator units. Workers from the power company labored throughout the night to restore electrical service to the main part of town. It took over a week to replace broken poles and wires. Drinking water was brought in milk creamer cans. Help from neighboring towns came during the summer to assist with the clean-up.

===Railroad===

The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Omaha Railroad went from Randolph to Magnet, then on to Bloomfield. Travelers who came to Magnet in 1894 had only a platform and an old box car to unload on when they arrived. During 1905–06, everything came by mail, groceries, farm goods, etc. In 1948–49, there was a very bad winter; at one time there was no train for six weeks. In the 1950s the train only came through three times a week. The tracks were eventually torn up in 1965.

===Jail House===

The jailhouse was built &quot;circa&quot; 1902. Bars on the windows were set to keep the prisoners in. Before it was moved it was an old voting booth. In the 1960s the building was moved and added on to serve as the county shed. It was one of the buildings that was destroyed by the tornado in 1975.

<text>Imperial is a city in Chase County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 2,071 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Chase County.

==History==
The original town of Imperial was built on land homesteaded by Thomas Mercier and M. J. Goodrich. These men gave a town lot to anyone who would put up a building and help to start the town. Mercier was the first postmaster and took office on December 14, 1885.

The railroad right of way was graded to Imperial in 1888. The railroad reached Imperial on August 15, 1892. It was built by a division of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. This line left the main line near Culbertson and terminated in Imperial.

When the grade was completed, the Lincoln Land Company gave lots to all those who would move their buildings to the &quot;Railroad Addition&quot;. Nearly all of the buildings were moved south to the future railroad line and the present location of the business district of the town was established.

Imperial&#x27;s first courthouse was built in 1889 on the land where the present courthouse stands.

<text>Kilgore is a village in Cherry County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 77 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Kilgore was founded, under the name of Boulware, in 1883 when the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad was extended to that point. In 1885, the village was renamed Georgia. Georgia was incorporated in 1893; the name of the settlement was changed in 1904 to Kilgore when the post office objected to the name Georgia, which could be confused with the state of Georgia. The name Kilgore was chosen in honor of a family of pioneer settlers.

The village experienced a heyday from the 1900s to the late 1920s. During that era, Kilgore &quot;boasted a post office, a medical doctor, a pharmacist, four general merchandise stores, two hotels, a livery stable, a lumber yard, hardware store, a harness and blacksmith shop, two new car dealerships, a hair dresser, pool hall, barber shop, bulk oil plant, three filling stations, a well driller, a livestock trucker, a full-time railroad depot, and a grain and feed elevator. There were two passenger trains each way each day, a town dray wagon, a small dairy, a meat market, two saloons, and several bootleggers who sold liquor to the Indians. The community also built a brick K-12 schoolhouse in 1929 when the population was over 250.&quot; But with the decline in railroads, the village&#x27;s importance declined. Today, Kilgore has fewer than 100 residents.

<text>Valentine is a city in and the county seat of Cherry County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 2,737 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Valentine was founded in 1882. The Valentine post office was established on December 4, 1882. The Sioux City and Pacific Railroad was extended to that point and train service began on April 1, 1883. It was named for Edward K. Valentine, a Nebraska representative.

As late as 1967, Valentine was split between two time zones. According to a news report, &quot;The mountain and central time zones meet at the center of Main Street, so an hour separates the two curb lines.&quot; According to the report, when clocks were required to be set back one hour for daylight saving time, Valentine&#x27;s post office (which was in the central zone) split the difference and turned back its clock by half an hour.

Valentine participates in an annual re-mailing program where thousands of pieces of mail flow into the local United States Post Office so that they can be re-mailed with a special Valentine&#x27;s Day postmark and verse.

In 2007, &quot;National Geographic Adventure&quot; magazine included Valentine in its list of the best 100 adventure towns and cities.

In the Lakota language, Valentine is known as or , meaning &quot;station stopping place&quot; or &quot;water and waterfall city&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Valentine is immediately north of the Niobrara River, on the northern edge of the Sandhills physiographic region. Merritt Reservoir, created by a dam on the Snake River, is about southwest of Valentine. Snake River Falls, Nebraska&#x27;s largest waterfall, is on the Snake River between the reservoir (a few miles downstream) and Valentine. Smith Falls, Nebraska&#x27;s tallest waterfall, is on a small stream tributary to the Niobrara River about east of Valentine in Smith Falls State Park.

Just south of Valentine, a pair of bridges span the Niobrara River. The modern bridge carries traffic north and south along U.S. Route 83.

<text>Dalton is a village in Cheyenne County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 315 at the 2010 census.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Dalton was founded &quot;circa&quot; 1900 when the Nebraska, Wyoming and Western Railroad was extended to that point. The railroad was certified in 1899 and railroad crews began surveying potential routes in Cheyenne County. In January 1900, the railroad purchased 150 acres of land from the Union Pacific Railroad, which had received the land in a land grant in 1867. The newly purchased land became a transportation hub for the Nebraska, Wyoming and Western Railroad, and the small town of Dalton that developed on the land became one of the work stations for the railroad. By September 1900, the railroad offered daily freight and passenger transportation north to Deadwood, South Dakota and south to Denver, Colorado from Dalton.

=== Post Office ===
The Dalton post office was established June 7, 1902 and Warren Woolsey was named the first postmaster.

=== Newspaper ===
The &quot;Dalton Herald&quot; was the first newspaper that was published in Dalton. It began publication in 1909 but did not remain in publication for long, although it remains unknown when exactly it went out of publication. The &quot;Dalton Delegate&quot; replaced the &quot;Herald&quot; in 1914 and was published every Friday until it went out of publication in September 1951.

=== Name Origins ===
The true origin of Dalton&#x27;s name remains a mystery. Some sources claim that Dalton was likely named after the town of Dalton, Massachusetts. Other sources maintain that Dalton was named after either Patrick Dalton, an early settler, or Patrick J. Dalton, an official of the Burlington Railroad.

==History==
Gurley was founded in 1913 when the railroad was extended to that point. It was named for Fred R. Gurley, superintendent with the Burlington Railroad. The first Gurley depot station was opened during the winter of 1915-1916. Three bunk cars served as a station building. One was the office, one was for freight and one was for living quarters for the agent and his family. The first agent was George Wallen. Fred Gurley was the agent from 1916-1919. During the time that Fred was the agent he started a park north of the depot. He planted flowers and made the trellis that was in the center of it and there is still a park there today. The Gurley Lumber Company was one of the first businesses in Gurley. S.J. Flora came in 1914 to be the manager of this business. The first person born in Gurley was Clara Anneva Flora, later to be named Clara Lessig. As of December 2008, Clara is still an active member of the Gurley community. The first general store and a post office were operated by F.W. Busse. In the same building, there was a pharmacy and a doctor&#x27;s office. Dr. Hart was the doctor at that time. He also had the first telephone switchboard in Gurley. Christ Weyerts built a Weyerts Garage and dance hall about 1915. The Gurley State Bank was built by Christ Weyerts in 1915 on the south side of main street. This closed in 1921. A.K. Greenlee built and operated a grocery and dry goods store on the south side. This brick building was built in 1915. Gurley&#x27;s first grain elevator was erected in 1914-1915 and burned on March 14, 1941. The rebuilt grain elevator was acquired by the Farmer&#x27;s Union Elevator in August 1960.

<text>Sidney is a city in and the county seat of Cheyenne County, Nebraska, United States. The city is north of the Colorado state line. The population was 6,410 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The city was named for Sidney Dillon, president of the Union Pacific Railroad. It was founded in 1867 by the Union Pacific and grew up around the military base of Fort Sidney (also known as Sidney Barracks), where soldiers were stationed to guard the transcontinental railroad against potential Native American attacks.

The town became the southern terminus of the Sidney Black Hills Stage Road which used Clarke&#x27;s Bridge (near Bridgeport, Nebraska) to allow military and civilian traffic to reach Fort Robinson, Red Cloud Agency, Spotted Tail Agency, Custer, South Dakota, and Deadwood, South Dakota in the late 1870s and 1880s.

When the railroad reached Sidney, it was the end of a sub-division of the rail line and played host to a roundhouse, repair facilities, and a railroad hotel for passengers.

Sidney is home to one of the Old West&#x27;s Boot Hill cemeteries; many of those interred there were soldiers from the fort.

The former headquarters for Cabela&#x27;s was located in Sidney until 2017, when Cabela’s was acquired by Bass Pro Shops. Approximately 2,000 jobs were eliminated, while about 120 were relocated to the Bass Pro Shops headquarters in Springfield, Missouri.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Sidney is toward the western edge of the Midwestern wheat-growing region. West of the city, the land is increasingly used for cattle ranching. Sidney is located along Lodgepole Creek, which is along present-day Interstate 80.

The city is presently located at the junction of U.S. Route 385 with I-80, and its location approximately halfway between Cheyenne, Wyoming, and North Platte, Nebraska, has encouraged the growth of the city as a major transportation service area on the Interstate. Because the I-80/US 385 interchange is located several miles southeast of the town center, a new commercial area has developed, including truck stops, convenience stores, the building that housed Cabela&#x27;s former world headquarters, shopping centers, motels, restaurants, and other commercial enterprises. In recent years, the city has seen further growth with the construction of wind farms in this portion of the Nebraska Panhandle and adjacent areas of Colorado, including Peetz.

<text>Glenvil is a village in Clay County, Nebraska, United States. The settlement was formerly also known as Glenville. The population was 267 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Hastings, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Glenvil was founded in 1873 when the St. Joseph &amp; Denver City Railroad was extended to that point.

The Glenvil post office, first established in 1873 (in the year the settlement was first surveyed) was spelled Glenville until 1914.

Glenvil&#x27;s population peaked at about 300 in the 1920s, and fell to about half that in 1998.

Glenville&#x27;s first school was organized during 1871-72 and, like other rural schools, was housed in a wood-frame building. It was demolished by a tornado and rebuilt in 1882. The Glenville School, the first substantial school in the village, operated from 1903 to 1995 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Glenvil received national attention in 1997 when residents wrote letters to celebrities asking for money to help build a new playground. Letters were sent to billionaire Warren Buffett, comedian Robin Williams, talk show hosts Jay Leno, David Letterman and Oprah Winfrey; and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates asking for financial help. Gates was the only one who responded as he wrote back and included a check for $5,000. Less than a month after Gates donated the $5,000 Merle Hinrichs, chairman of Asian Sources Media in Hong Kong, mailed a check for $20,000 after project organizers said they needed more money for playground equipment. Hinrichs attended school in Glenvil.

==Economy==
Schuyler&#x27;s single largest employer is the Cargill beef processing plant, with approximately 2,000 employees. The plant opened in 1968 as a Spencer Packing Co. facility. Other major employers include Schuyler Community Schools, with 245 employees; Alegent Health Memorial Hospital, with 82 full-time and 31 part-time employees; and QC Supply, a manufacturer and distributor of farm and ranch supplies with 75 full-time employees.

==History==
In 1866, the Union Pacific Railroad reached present-day Schuyler, at the time known as Shell Creek Station. Three years later, the Nebraska State Legislature divided large Platte County into three smaller counties, including Colfax County. In 1870, Shell Creek Station was renamed Schuyler.

In 1870, the Union Pacific chose the town as the point at which Texas cattle being driven north would be loaded onto trains. With this, Schuyler became Nebraska&#x27;s first &quot;cow town&quot;. However, the resulting boom, which saw a six-fold increase in the town&#x27;s population (from 100 to 600) and around 50,000 head of cattle pass through, was only temporary: the next year, the terminus of the cattle trail had moved west to Kearney.

The city&#x27;s early residents were Czech, Irish, and German settlers. Settlement was enabled by Schuyler&#x27;s geographic position, which caused the community to be associated with a number of historic overland transportation routes, including:
* Oregon Trail (1836–1869)
* Mormon Trail (1840s–1850s)
* Transcontinental Railway (1866–present)
* Coast-to-coast Lincoln Highway (1913–1925)

Beginning in the late 1980s, reductions in wages at the Cargill beef processing plant led to a change in Schuyler&#x27;s demographic makeup. By 2017, an estimated 60% of the population was Latino, and immigrants from other parts of the world, including Somalia and Thailand, had also moved to the city.

In December 2020, the Schuyler City Council voted to reject the formation of a board of health, which would have potentially resulted in a mask mandate. In January 2021, the city council voted to establish a board of health and appointed members, after two previous attempts failed. The council passed a revised ordinance which gave the board power to only suggest actions to the city council. 

In March 2021, law enforcement sent a letter to Schuyler Community Schools complaining about an incident on February 24, 2021 involving a student. Law enforcement also said the relationship between the two entities was strained.

==Attractions==
In 1935, monks from the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien established a community in Schuyler as a means of supporting the congregation&#x27;s missions in Africa and Asia. At present, Christ the King Priory is home to 11 monks. The monks&#x27; apostolate has expanded to providing retreats at the recently constructed Saint Benedict Center, four miles north of Schuyler.
The Oak Ballroom, completed by the Works Progress Administration in 1937 and now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built using dozens of native oak trees hauled to the building site from the nearby Platte River using horses and wagons.

==Transportation==
Intercity bus service to the city is provided by Express Arrow.

<text>Bancroft is a village in Cuming County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 496 as of the 2020 census.

John Neihardt, who later became Nebraska&#x27;s poet laureate, lived in Bancroft for twenty years and wrote many of his works there. His study is preserved at the John G. Neihardt State Historic Site in the village.

==History==
Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years before European encounter. By the mid-eighteenth century, the Omaha tribe lived on the west side of the Missouri River throughout this area.

The settlement was originally known as &quot;Unashta Zinga,&quot; meaning &quot;little stopping place&quot; in a Native American language. The site that became Bancroft was homesteaded in the mid-1870s by Ford Bella Barber and Deborah (Watson) Barber, who came from Maine to settle in Nebraska. In 1880, when the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway began planning a line through the area, the Barbers deeded of land to the railway for the platting of a town. At that time, the approximately 25 residents were of mostly German, Irish, and Scandinavian descent; some were immigrants. When the village was platted, townspeople named it Barbersville, but the couple refused the honor. The village was named after George Bancroft. Sources differ on who this was. In her 1925 &quot;Nebraska Place-Names&quot;, Lilian Linder Fitzpatrick says that it was historian George Bancroft. However, more recent sources say that the Bancroft whose name was used was &quot;a well-liked civil engineer with the railroad&quot;.

In 1884, of the Omaha Reservation was sold to &quot;actual residents&quot;. This brought an influx of white settlers to that portion of the reservation; and Bancroft, located at the southern edge of the reservation, profited from the increased business. The population grew until 1910, when it reached a peak of 742. The Great Depression drove many of Bancroft&#x27;s residents away to larger cities; but the onset of World War II brought a revival of prosperity.

==John Neihardt==
In 1900, the 19-year-old John G. Neihardt and his family moved to Bancroft, where he worked as assistant to a trader with the Omaha. He learned about the Omaha traditions and customs while working with them. Neihardt had already begun writing; he had published his first book, &quot;The Divine Enchantment&quot;, in 1897. His experiences among the Omaha strongly influenced his subsequent work.

In September 1903, Neihardt became co-owner and editor of the weekly &quot;Bancroft Blade&quot;. He resigned this position in January 1905; he had enjoyed writing editorials, but could not maintain interest in the stuff of local news. From that point, he devoted himself to writing fiction and poetry, quickly winning national recognition.

In 1911, Neihardt rented a one-room building for a study. In 1912, he began his epic &quot;Cycle of the West&quot; there. He continued to work in the study until 1920, when he moved to Branson, Missouri. In the following year, the Nebraska Legislature named him &quot;Poet Laureate of Nebraska and the Plains&quot;.

Neihardt&#x27;s study was restored in 1967; in 1970, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1976, the John G. Neihardt State Historic Site was opened. Beside the studio, this includes a museum, a library, and the restored Sacred Hoop Prayer Garden. This was designed based on symbolism in Niehardt&#x27;s &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; (1932). This has become his best-known work, based on the oral history and spiritual teachings of Black Elk, a prominent Oglala Lakota sachem or medicine man.

<doc id="123824" wikidata="Q3287913" url="?curid=123824" title="Beemer, Nebraska">
<text>Beemer is a village in Cuming County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 678 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Beemer is located on the table lands adjoining the Elkhorn River bottoms, 84 miles from Omaha and nine miles northwest of West Point, near the geographic center of Cuming County where Nebraska Link 20A meets U.S. Route 275.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
==History==

===Early settlement===

The first settlers of European descent arrived in the Beemer area by prairie schooner in 1864, seeking land under the Homestead Act. The new inhabitants built dugouts, sod houses, and, eventually, log cabins. The earliest settlers in Beemer Township included M. Brayrerton, George Graham, Joseph S. Emley, Robert Fehlmann, Dr. H.H. Howe, Howard Howe, James and Michael McNamara, Judge Newburn, the Rabe family, W.S. Schneald, William Sharp and two sons Martin and Silas, Casper Schifferns, David Simons, Wm. A. Smith, J.E. Spencer, Benjamin Ewing, John Wagaoner, Henry White, James Wilson, and William Witte.

The first school in Beemer Township was taught by Mrs. William Sharp in 1867 in her log cabin, a short distance to the northwest of where Beemer is now located.

West of Beemer, a small stream called Rock Creek flows into the south side of the Elkhorn River. In 1865, August Lambrecht built a water-driven grain and flour mill on the creek about from the river. Lambrecht&#x27;s mill, combined with the creek and with favorable agricultural conditions, attracted a small concentration of settlers; the area was known as &quot;Rock Creek&quot;, after the stream. 

In 1871, the tracks of the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad, which followed the Elkhorn upstream from Fremont, reached Wisner; the line reached Norfolk in 1879. As the railway was extended, water stops were needed at intervals to support the steam locomotives. The railroad stops were also served by telegraphs for the purpose of administering and controlling the railroad as well as business development of the telegraphs. The telegraph station at the water stop located at the site of present-day Beemer was named after the nearest significant settlement, Rock Creek, and used the call letters &quot;R C&quot;. So, for the next fifteen years, two locations, several miles apart and on opposite sides of the Elkhorn, were referred to as &#x27;Rock Creek&#x27;: one was the area around the Rock Creek stream near Lambrecht&#x27;s mill and the other the area around the railway water stop and telegraph station.

===Forming a village===

In 1885, Allen D. Beemer, George Canfield, and K.C. Morehouse laid out lots to the north of the Rock Creek water stop and platted a village to be known as Rock Creek, as filed in the county seat of West Point on May 26, 1885. Mr. Beemer built the first rail depot building, and led the drive to build a wooden bridge across the Elkhorn. His efforts on behalf of the area were rewarded in 1886, when Congressman Edward K. Valentine secured a post office for the settlement, naming it the Beemer Post Office. On July 15, 1886, in response to a petition of 54 residents, a village named Beemer was incorporated with Harry Delmont, W.D. Gibbon, John M. Barber, F.J. Fitzgerald, and Niels Hansen the village trustees. In that year Mr. Beemer founded a newspaper, the &quot;Beemer Times&quot;; and the rail company changed the name of the station from Rock Creek to Beemer, although its telegraph call signs remained &quot;R C&quot; (for &quot;Rock Creek&quot;) until the depot closed in 1963.

===Beemer&#x27;s first century, 1886 - 1986===

The first century was marked by spurious growth and numerous initiatives to develop Beemer. The Beemer Times, founded by A.D. Beemer around March 1, 1886, chronicled the times, the progress, the achievements, the disasters, and the dilemmas that faced early Beemer. The paper assailed ills like the muddy streets, the lack of sidewalks, and the excessive number of taverns; and it reported on more favorable developments like improvements to the schooling, new commercial enterprises, and major modernizations such as waterworks, electrification, road improvements, and telephone systems.


====Churches====

Five churches were established in Beemer during this era. The Methodist Episcopal Church was built at the northeast corner of Fifth and Beemer Streets and dedicated September 5, 1886. In 1904, it moved to a new building on the northwest corner of Third and Fraisier streets. The first St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church building, with a steeple, was built on the southeast corner of Third and Lambrecht streets and dedicated July 2, 1893. The Congregational Church at the northeast corner of Third and Canfield streets was dedicated January 14, 1900. 
The Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church, at the southwest corner of Sixth and Frasier streets, was dedicated on September 20, 1914. The Mennonite Church at the southwest corner of Sherman and Fourth streets was dedicated on March 15, 1959.

====Schools====
The first Beemer Public School was held in a small frame building located on the northeast corner of Third and Beemer Streets. By 1886, in order to support its 32 enrolled pupils, a two-room, frame building was built on the southwest corner of Fifth and Beemer Streets. The names of absent or tardy students were duly reported in the Beemer Times. In 1892, voters approved $10,000 in bonds for a modern two-story brick school. The school officers, F.J. Fitzgerald, A.D. Beemer, and Charles Decker reported an enrollment of 210 pupils. The building was erected on the north side of Third Street between Blaine and Harrison Streets (approximately where a 1964 addition to the school was eventually built). In 1917, the village passed another bond issue for a new school building on the northeast corner of Third and Blaine Streets. The new building was used for the graduation ceremonies in May 1918; the older, adjacent building was torn down that summer. The 1918 building would continue to be used until 2008.

C&amp;NW ended railroad service in the spring of 1982, after flooding damaged many sections of the track &amp; abandonment was applied for. The tracks were removed just a few years later.

<text>West Point is a city in and the county seat of Cuming County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 3,504 at the 2020 census.

==History==
West Point was founded in the spring of 1857, when Omaha businessmen formed the Nebraska Settlement Association in order to find suitable townsites in the Elkhorn Valley. Uriah, John, and Andrew Bruner (three brothers originally from Pennsylvania), and William Sexauer chose the present location on a bend along a river, which they called New Philadelphia. The name was soon changed to West Point because it was the westernmost outpost along the valley.

West Point became the county seat of Cuming County on October 12, 1858, after winning the election over the community of DeWitt. A total of 19 votes were split between the two towns with West Point obtaining 12 votes. By the spring of 1859, over 4,000 Pawnee natives flooded the Elkhorn Valley during a hunting excursion and, displeased to find white settlers in the valley, burned several homesteads and killed livestock. The so-called Pawnee War ended near Battle Creek without a fight.

West Point grew slowly at first, but with the coming of the railroad in 1870, it boomed to a population of over 700.

By the mid-1970s, the future of railroad service came into question. The Chicago &amp; North Western tracks had been experiencing declining freight traffic volumes. Revenue railroad service ended in spring of 1982, when flooding from the Elkhorn River damaged sections of the track. With freight traffic declining and flooding damage, the C&amp;NW filed a request with the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon the line. Permission was granted a short time later, leaving the tracks with a dismal future. Plans were made to revive railroad service from the newly formed Fremont &amp; Elkhorn Valley Railroad, who purchased the abandoned C&amp;NW track. Those plans were to bring tourists in that got on the train in Fremont &amp; possibly run freight. However, the costs were too high to revive railroad service, and the tracks were removed in 1988.

On August 26, 2019, the DHHS announced that the city&#x27;s water was unsafe to drink after a year of complaints from citizens of the town. The maximum safe level of manganese for infants had been exceeded by over 700 micrograms per mL.

==Livestock industry==
Wisner is known as the livestock center of Nebraska; their economic activities include farming, and cattle and hog feeding. There are approximately 130,000 cattle boarders feeding in Wisner over 15 feedlots at one time. Louis Dinklage, a pioneer of commercial cattle feeding, got his start in Wisner and funded many of Wisner&#x27;s public attractions.

===Louis Dinklage and Dinklage Co.===
Louis Dinklage was inducted into the Cattle Feeders Hall of Fame in 2013. Dinklage is considered one of the pioneers of commercial cattle feeding. He started his operation with only 25 to 30 head of cattle, but by 1923 had expanded to 400 head of cattle. He originally had a goal of 1,000 head of cattle, but by the late 1930s he fed roughly 3,000 to 4,000 head of cattle with a shovel and a team of horses. By the 1960s, Dinklage had 65,000 head of cattle, which made him the largest private cattle-feed operator in the United States. Louis Dinklage influenced and mentored many of Nebraska&#x27;s top cattle feeders and was instrumental in founding Dinklage Feedyards.

===Herman Dinklage, Inc. and tornado devastation===
Wisner and surrounding areas were hit by the 2014 Pilger, Nebraska tornado family. Herman Dinklage, Inc., a farming company owned and operated by Jeff and David Dinklage, was completely leveled to the ground. Jeff Dinklage, a 4th generation farmer, and his family had operated the farm on this land for almost a century. The Dinklage barn, farm equipment, including a planter, combine, and bailer, and home were destroyed as well as nearly 300 cattle killed.

==Wisner landmarks==
Dinklage Park—Originally known as &quot;City Park&quot;, it was donated to the city by the railroad. Located next to the original Wisner high school building, it featured a large gazebo and was often the site for graduations and school activities. In 1960, a swimming pool was built on the site, and that pool was replaced in 1982 with a heated, Olympic-sized pool courtesy of contributions by Wisner cattleman Louis Dinklage. The park was renamed in honor of Louis and his wife Abby Faye in 1982.

Dutch Hollow—Formerly a wooded valley at the base of Nye Hill, it became one of the earliest settled parts of Wisner, and many of its oldest houses can be found here. Ninth Street in Wisner directly runs the route that Dutch Hollow ran, and this street is still referred to as &quot;Dutch Hollow&quot; by residents.

Elkhorn River—Wisner is located directly on the border of this tributary of the Platte River, and it has been the source of several momentous events, such as major floods in 1966 and 1994, as well as a barge accident that killed three children in 1888. Because the river runs at a southeast angle, the roads of Wisner run a similar path, and very few roads in Wisner actually run truly north, south, east or west, but at a severely altered angle. In June 2010 floodwaters washed away the approach to the bridge, inconveniencing local travel and commerce.

Kane&#x27;s Lake—A lake located directly south of the Elkhorn River, and the lake for which the unincorporated &quot;Lakeview&quot; (Wisner&#x27;s original name) was named.

Land of Nod—This was an amusement park located just north of today&#x27;s River Park, from 1917–1940. Founded by Wisner businessman Andy Peterson, it featured livestock show barns, a dance hall and an ice skating rink and was the site of Wisner&#x27;s first baseball diamond. It was an ambitious project that ultimately failed (mostly due to the development of the nearby City Park). Only the park&#x27;s brick pillared entry and Peterson&#x27;s home remains standing.

Nye Hill—The hill upon which a major portion of the city was built, and it was named for the veterinarian who built his home directly upon it, and who owned the majority of the surrounding property. His home and the barn that he used for his practice still remain today.

River Park—Also called &quot;Community Park&quot; and perched directly by the Elkhorn River, this was built on land purchased by the city of Wisner in 1927. Over the years it has been the site of community baseball games (including several state tournaments), high school football (1933–1968), as well as snowmobile and motocross racing. Most recently, two fields for softball and youth baseball have been added (the softball fields have both served as the home field for the Wisner-Pilger High School softball team since the school started playing the sport in 2007), as well as a tractor pull arena for the annual &quot;Thunder By The River&quot; competition. It also features a rodeo arena and show barns for livestock shows, and has been the site for countless community concerts and activities.

Rock Creek—The primary tributary of the Elkhorn River in the region, located south of Wisner. It was the site of an unincorporated collection of German farmers in the late 19th century who felt shunned by area communities, particularly Wisner and Beemer, Nebraska. The farmers formed a baseball team that became well known throughout Nebraska and Iowa, and was known for drawing large crowds to its games. The &quot;Rock Creek Tigers&quot; played until 1952, when fielding a team became too expensive, and its remaining players began playing for Wisner and the West Point, Nebraska Bombers.

West Field—A pasture owned by the West family, where Wisner High first played football through 1930. The Wisner Auditorium, the community tennis courts and the Wisner volunteer fire department are now located on this property.

&quot;The Blacktop&quot;—An asphalt-paved two-lane road leading south of Wisner, crossing the Elkhorn River. The road was paved in 1964, as the newly constructed Elkhorn River Bridge made it the only route into Wisner from the south. Its true name is &quot;6th Road&quot; (named in 1995 when postal routes were re-defined), but residents south of Wisner (including the Rock Creek community, which lies directly on its route) refer to it as &quot;The Blacktop&quot;, after a regional nickname for its asphalt surface. The road connects U.S. Highway 275 Highway to Nebraska Highway 32, which has made it well known as a significant shortcut to Lincoln, Nebraska for area travelers.

U.S. Route 275—Known as &quot;Highway 275&quot;, it runs directly through Wisner, forming Wisner&#x27;s main street and business district. Plans to divert Highway 275 to routes north of town (as part of a four lane expressway project) have been continually discussed, with local businesses hoping for a portion of the highway&#x27;s traffic to continue to run through Wisner.
