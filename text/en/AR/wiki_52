He was the son of Robert and Elizabeth (Grant) Stephen. In 1839, when Arthur was nine years old, the Stephen family came to America and settled in Knox County, Illinois. His father was a schoolteacher and young Arthur learned the trade of bricklayer.

<doc id="122064" wikidata="Q862658" url="?curid=122064" title="Stillwater, Minnesota">
<text>Stillwater is a city in the U.S. state of Minnesota and the county seat of Washington County. It is in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, on the west bank of the St. Croix River, across from Houlton, Wisconsin. Stillwater&#x27;s population was 19,394 at the 2020 census. Stillwater is often called &quot;the birthplace of Minnesota&quot; due to its role in the establishment of the state.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water. State Highways 36, 95, and 96 are three of the community&#x27;s main routes.

== Climate ==
Stillwater receives an average annual snowfall of . Average annual rainfall is . Each year has an average of 14 days above .

== Name ==
The name &quot;Stillwater&quot; was proposed in 1843 by John McKusick, who built the settlement&#x27;s first sawmill. McKusick was later a state senator. The name derives from the St. Croix River&#x27;s calmness near the town center. It is also believed that McKusick had fond memories of Stillwater, Maine, where he had migrated from.

Long before European Americans arrived the area was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The Dakota people called it &quot;Hoġan Wanḳe Kin,&quot; a term that encompassed not only the St. Croix River but also Lake St. Croix and a large sandbar across from present-day Afton. The name, meaning &quot;the place where the fish lies&quot;, derived from a legend in which a man was transformed into a giant fish (a catfish or a pike, depending on the version) and then into a sandbar. In English, Hoġan Wanḳe Kin has been spelled variously as Hogan-wahnkay-kin, Hogan-wauke-kin and Hogan-wan-kee.

The Ojibwe name for the place was &quot;Giigoonzh-agomod&quot;, with the slightly different meaning of &quot;where the fish floats&quot;. The Ojibwe origin legend is very similar, also involving a man transformed into a giant fish and found floating in the lake. He was ultimately transformed into &quot;a piece of land crossing the lake there&quot; (i.e., the sandbar). In English renderings, Giigo onh-zhagomod has been spelled as Kee-go-shagewa-minnie and Kegan-Shaw-Ga-Nut.

==History==

In the 1830s, European Americans were pressing west into this territory. The U.S. government tried to arrange for their settlement in Native American lands, and on July 29 and September 29, 1837, it signed treaties with the local Ojibwe and Dakota nations to allow such settlement in the St. Croix Valley.

The settlement was founded on October 26, 1843, when four partners formed the Stillwater Lumber Company. Settlers were drawn by the area&#x27;s abundant lumber and river traffic resulting from the industry. This was one of Minnesota&#x27;s oldest towns, preceding Minneapolis by several years. Stillwater was officially incorporated as a city on March 4, 1854 (the same day as St. Paul).

Stillwater is often called the &quot;birthplace of Minnesota&quot;. In 1848, a territorial convention that began the process of establishing Minnesota as a state was held in Stillwater, at the corner of Myrtle and Main streets. Originally part of the Wisconsin Territory, Minnesota officially became a separate territory in 1849 and, after population increases, a state in 1858.

As more evidence of Stillwater&#x27;s importance at the time, the territorial convention selected three leading Minnesota cities as locations for three important public institutions: Saint Paul was designated as the capital; the University of Minnesota was established at Minneapolis; and Stillwater became the site of the territory&#x27;s first prison. The Minnesota Territorial Prison (later Minnesota State Prison) was opened in 1853. The prison held Cole, Jim, and Bob Younger, three of the Younger brothers of the James–Younger Gang.

Lumbering was the predominant industry in the St. Croix River Valley in the second half of the 19th century. For many years, lumbermen sent large rafts of logs down the St. Croix. They were collected at the St. Croix Boom Site two miles upstream of Stillwater, and processed in Stillwater&#x27;s many sawmills. Steamboats were used most widely on the river from 1860 to 1890. A few still operate as entertainment venues today.

David Swain operated a shipyard and engine works in Stillwater. Excursion steamboats, such as the &quot;Verne Swain&quot; and the &quot;Capitol&quot;, began to operate in the early 20th century, taking passengers to other cities along the river.

During the American Civil War, Stillwater sent men of the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Company B, 5th Minnesota Infantry Regiment Company K, and the 8th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment Company C, among others, to fight for the Union.

On October 18, 1921, Charles Strite invented the automatic pop-up bread toaster in Stillwater. By 1926, the Toastmaster Company began to market the first household toaster using a redesigned version of Strite&#x27;s invention. In 1923, Nelson&#x27;s Ice Cream parlor was established.

In 1931, construction of the Stillwater lift bridge over the St. Croix River was completed at a final cost of $460,174, which was split equally between Minnesota and Wisconsin. The lift bridge is one of the city&#x27;s most iconic and visible local monuments. It was part of Minnesota State Highway 36 until 2017, when it closed to vehicle traffic. In 2020 it became part of a five-mile trail loop running through Stillwater and Houlton, Wisconsin.

In 1996 the city of Stillwater entered into an agreement with Stillwater Township to annex land. In 2015 the Stillwater city council approved the annexing the last of the land covered by the agreement. The city&#x27;s western border is now Manning Avenue (County Road 15). The northern border is now mostly, but not entirely, Minnesota Highway 96.

Stillwater was described as the Minnesota headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan in 1991, and has been identified as a &quot;probable&quot; former sundown town.

<text>Woodbury ( ) is a city in Washington County, Minnesota, United States, eight miles (13 km) east of Saint Paul along Interstate 94. It is part of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. The population was 75,102 at the 2020 census, making it Minnesota&#x27;s seventh most populous city.

==History==
At almost 36 square miles, Woodbury is a direct descendant of one of the congressional townships into which Minnesota Territory when the Native Americans of the United States ceded the territory and opened it to &quot;settlement&quot;. Woodbury was originally named Red Rock, but was renamed after Levi Woodbury, the first justice of the Supreme Court of the United States to attend law school, after it was realized that another Red Rock Township existed in Minnesota. When first settled in 1844, the land was mostly wood, but it was converted to farmland. The township government was organized in 1858. One of the city&#x27;s few surviving 19th-century farms, the Charles Spangenberg Farmstead, is on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1955, the first suburban development broke ground in Woodbury: Woodbury Heights. After some years of growth, the town government could not adequately provide services for new developments, and it became clear that Woodbury needed the government of a village with extra privileges. The earliest proposal for incorporation officially came in 1963 after two years of debate.

The Minnesota Municipal Commission had recently found that the fragmented way in which the Minneapolis suburbs and the suburbs around White Bear Lake had developed was disadvantageous, as it made coordinating sewers, public water systems, and other utilities difficult. Thus, the Commission had been encouraging towns to incorporate in full whenever possible.

Since 1961, the Town of Cottage Grove had been petitioning to become a village, and the Minnesota Municipal Commission took it upon itself to push for a joint incorporation of Woodbury and Cottage Grove as the Village of Washington. The two town commissions agreed to the idea, and the issue was put up for a vote during the general election of 1963. It lost with 662 votes for joint incorporation, and 1,284 against. Cottage Grove incorporated on its own in 1965.

In 1966, a series of meetings took place setting up the incorporation of the Village of Woodbury. A vote was conducted on February 14, 1967, with 543 voting for incorporation, and 164 against. The Village was officially incorporated on March 7, 1967.

<text>Tenney is an unincorporated community and former city in section 28 of Campbell Township, Wilkin County, Minnesota, United States. A post office was established there in 1887, and Tenney was incorporated as a city on November 30, 1901. The population was five at the 2010 census, tying Tenney with Funkley as Minnesota&#x27;s least populous community. It is part of the Wahpeton, ND–MN Micropolitan Statistical Area. The only remnant of Tenney is a grain elevator along the tracks on the south side of town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Tenney is located in the flat basin of prehistoric Lake Agassiz, a glacial lake that existed at the end of the last ice age. The area&#x27;s remarkably flat land is sometimes described as the upper valley of the Red River, though it is not technically in the Red River valley, but is near the Bois de Sioux River.

==History==
The city of Tenney was named for the owner of its site, lumberman John P. Tenney, because of his willingness to give land to the railroad, which came through in 1885. The first house was built by his son-in-law, Fred Maechler. The post office was established in 1887, the plat was filed for record with the office of the Register of Deeds in Wilkin County on August 4, 1887, and the city was incorporated on November 30, 1901. The city originally encompassed four square miles, but never grew enough to meet its boundaries, so in 1916 the farmers petitioned their land from the city, and their request was granted. According to an unpublished town history written in the mid-1980s, the city&#x27;s population peaked at about 200 in 1910. Before 1910 the city boasted a church, three grain elevators, a hardware store, two mercantile stores, a butcher shop, bank, machine shop, implement shop, blacksmith shop, pool hall, lumberyard, and a hotel, which also housed the barber shop, saloon, and post office. In 1909 a small post office building was erected and used until 1952, when Leonard Hardie became postmaster and moved the post office to the general store. Electricity arrived in Tenney in 1914, through a franchise granted to Otter Tail Power Company.

After 1910 steady population decline was driven by the lack of significant population in outlying areas, migration to larger urban centers, and the absence of dynamic economic factors to generate wealth. The hardware store closed in 1928 and the bank, like thousands of other undercapitalized small-town banks in the United States, went out of business in 1929 or 1930 in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929. U.S. Census bureau data indicates that the population fell to 102 in 1920, 80 in 1930, rose slightly to 89 in 1940, and fell to 62 in 1950, 35 in 1960 and 24 in 1970. As local establishments burned down or went out of business they were not replaced, and finally the post office was discontinued in 1980 when the census bureau pegged Tenney&#x27;s population at 19. Today the only remaining business in town is the elevator. The last commercial building remaining in town was the former James Bigsby general store (later owned by G. A. Klugman), which also housed the post office until its closing in 1980.

The population reached its lowest point of 2 sometime after the 2000 census, but had risen to 5 by the 2010 census.

In late June 2011, residents of Tenney voted 2 to 1 to dissolve the town and have it become part of Campbell Township.

==Description==
The community encompassed two and a half blocks, but the elevator is all that remains as of mid-2024.

==Location==
Tenney is on Minnesota Highway 55 in far western Minnesota. It is approximately east of the junction of Minnesota Highway 55 and U.S. Route 75. It is six miles (10 km) east of Fairmount, North Dakota; south of Moorhead and northwest of Minneapolis. It is at roughly the same longitude as Tulsa, Oklahoma and Dallas, and approximately the same latitude as Walla Walla, Washington and Montreal, Quebec.

==Points of interest==
===Tenney Fire Hall===
The Tenney Fire Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was a small wood-frame building with a bell tower and flag mast, built in 1904. It housed the town&#x27;s two hand-pulled chemical fire engines. The rearmost part of the building also contained the town jail. This building had passed into private ownership, but the city had hoped to reacquire it and perform important repairs, but the building no longer stands. According to the National Register&#x27;s Inventory-Nomination Form, the Fire Hall was significant for the following reasons:

#&quot;Government functions were often centered in towns, [including] places as small as Tenney with its Fire Hall...&quot;
#&quot;Though of simple metal-sided, frame construction, the diminutive Tenney Fire Hall...is a visual landmark in the small town.&quot;

===City Hall===
The City Hall was at 295 Concord Avenue (the town&#x27;s main north–south street). It was open to the public 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, and visitors were invited to go inside and sign the town&#x27;s guestbook. City Hall was built in the early 1900s as a community church. Later it was a Baptist church. From 1914 to 1946 it was the Evangelical church, from 1946 to 1968 the Evangelical United Brethren church, and from 1968 until closing in 1997 it was the Tenney United Methodist Church. The building was purchased in 1999 and had been renovated and expanded in 2006 / 2007, but has since disappeared from the landscape.

===The Wheaton-Dumont Cooperative Elevator===
The Co-op had its primary rail terminal in Tenney. In 2003, 20 million bushels of grain were trucked into Tenney from other elevators and shipped out by rail. At that time it was estimated that in 2004 this figure would rise to 32 million bushels. The elevator is served by the Soo Line Railroad, which is the United States arm of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

The site was of the village of Keoxa of Dakota people. The city is named after Winona, a figure in a Sioux legend.

European immigrants settled the area in 1851 and laid out the town into lots in 1852 and 1853. The original settlers were immigrants from New England. The population increased from 815 in December 1855, to 3,000 in December 1856. In 1856, German immigrants arrived as well. The Germans and the Yankees worked together planting trees and building businesses based on lumber, wheat, steamboating and railroads. Between 1859 and 1900, some 5,000 Poles and closely related Kashubians emigrated to Winona, making up one quarter of the population. Since 80% of them were Kashubians, Winona became known as the &quot;Kashubian Capital of America&quot;. As a result of the influx of Polish Catholic immigrants, the Church of St. Stanislaus (now Basilica of St. Stanislaus Kostka) was built. For a time, Winona had more millionaires than any other city of its size in the United States.

The railroad and steamboat transportation industries helped Winona grow into a small city that diversified into wheat milling, and lumber production. In 1856, more than 1,300 steamboats stopped at Winona. The Winona and St. Peter Railroad first segment of from Winona to Stockton, Minnesota was completed by the end of 1862. Winona then had the second operational railroad in Minnesota, after the St. Paul and Pacific Line from Saint Paul to St. Anthony Falls. In December 1870, the Mississippi River was bridged at Winona by the Winona Rail Bridge. In 1892, a wagon toll-bridge over the Mississippi, a steel high-bridge, was completed and remained in service until the opening of the Main Channel Bridge in 1942.

Winona has two historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places that combine into a single local historic district administered by the city&#x27;s Heritage Preservation Commission.

A bandshell was completed in 1924 for outdoor musical performances and events. The Winona Municipal Band holds concerts there during the summer.

<text>Monticello ( ) is a city next to the Mississippi River in Wright County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 14,455 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The city&#x27;s latitude is 45.305 degrees North and its longitude is 93.793 degrees West. Its elevation is 922 feet. Monticello is in the Central time zone.

===Parks===
 Monticello has an extensive parks and pathway system, including 28 city-owned parks and miles of winding trails. Lake Maria State Park, Montissippi Regional Park and the Harry Larsen Memorial Park are three of the largest. At Swan Park, each winter between December and March, as many as 2,700 trumpeter swans nest near Mississippi Drive in Monticello, as the Mississippi River is heated from warm water discharged by the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant.

The City of Monticello and Wright County partnered and acquired 1,200 acres of open space in Wright County, known as the Bertram Chain of Lakes. The Bertram Chain includes four lakes and acres of undisturbed shoreline, natural habitat, and oak forest, 812 of which are open for public enjoyment. It provides users access to 4 miles of hiking trails, 10 miles of single-track mountain biking trails, beach at Bertram Lake for swimming, and carry-in access to Long Lake, which allow the opportunity to paddle Long, Mud and First Lakes. Winter activities include fat-biking, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. Summer activities include paddleboard classes, canoeing excursions, kids fishing programs, and guided moonlight hiking.

==History==
Monticello was platted in 1854. A post office has been in operation at Monticello since 1855. Monticello was incorporated in 1856. The nearby village of Moritzious merged with Monticello in 1891.

In 1971, the Monticello Nuclear Plant began operation.

In May 2006, the Monticello Middle School had an electrical fire from the large amount of rain settling on the roof. The smoke damage to the school caused the school to be closed for the rest of the school year. As a result, middle school and high school students had to share usage of the high school building on an alternate-day schedule. The school year did not get extended, and the clean-up was completed in time for the 2006–07 school year. 

==Economy==
In anticipation of rapid population growth, Monticello created a comprehensive growth plan in 1996. A new high school was constructed in 1999. A new highway interchange was completed in 2006 on the east end of town, allowing residents full access to Interstate 94 from Wright County Road 18. Since 2002, many retail outlets have been constructed. This planned growth has also brought new auto dealerships, hotels, and industrial development. A 2004 annexation agreement with Monticello Township is expected to help sustain Monticello&#x27;s growth for the next twenty years.

===Top employers===
According to Monticello&#x27;s 2021 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR), its top employers are:

<text>Waverly is a city in Wright County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,900 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The framework for the City of Waverly began in 1855, when the territorial legislature passed an act organizing Wright County. A survey team was sent out shortly after by the government to plot the new county&#x27;s divisions. These surveyors were greeted by established homesteaders who had already begun clearing the land and planting crops. Prior to European settlement, Waverly was predominantly Big Woods which included a mixture of oak, maple, basswood and hickory. Small portions of wet prairie existed on the eastern edge of Waverly Lake and along the western edge of present-day CSAH 8.

Impressed with the two lakes (Waverly and Little Waverly), available water power and the proximity of the Crow River one mile north, an entrepreneurial surveyor and his partners constructed a dam, saw mill and grist mill in 1856 at the outlet of Little Waverly Lake. The settlement known as Waverly Mills was beginning to take shape, as approximately three hundred acres were surveyed and platted. Waverly Mills was given its name after a community in Tioga County, New York, the former home of one of the partners. After a rough start with a bank panic, financial crash and subsequent grasshopper infestations, Waverly Mills managed to survive. Its saw and grist milling industry help to establish a store, post office and log church with a cemetery at this location.

The village was formerly called Waverly Station to distinguish it from Old Waverly, a pioneer village which in the early days flourished about a mile away. Waverly Station was laid out by the railroad company on their land in the southwest quarter of section 33, at about the time that regular trains commenced operating in this locality in 1868. A railroad station was erected that year, and a grain house the next. The first store was opened by T. R. Barrett, who operated it for a few years, and then changed it to a hotel under the name of the Keystone House.

Among the lodges in the early 1900s were the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic Order of Foresters, the Modern Woodmen of America, the Modern Brotherhood of America, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Royal Neighbors of America, and others.

The school which once stood where the current Humphrey Elementary School now stands was built in 1905 and was composed of a brick structure, two stories high, with a basement; and run by four teachers. In addition to a complete course, the school taught manual training and music.

Waverly Station was incorporated as a village in 1881; the village was reincorporated as Waverly in 1885. The following notation appears in the county records: &quot;March 16, 1885. A special election called by the trustees of the village of Waverly for the purpose of ascertaining by ballot whether the village of Waverly should continue as the incorporated under a special act of the legislature or become reincorporated under the General Statute of Minnesota, was held on Monday, March 16, 1885. Due notice of said election having been given and the object of said election having been fully set forth in notices, polls opened at 10 a. m. and closed at 4 p. m. Number of votes polled, 41; for reincorporation, 41; against, none. The village of Waverly was therefore declared reincorporated under the General Statutes of Minnesota and same recorded in the village records.

The prosperity of Waverly in those early days was aided by both railroad traffic and by patronage of the surrounding settlers in Woodland and Marysville Townships. Many of these early farmers hailed from various parts of the United States, French Canada and European countries specifically from Sweden, Ireland, Germany, Prussia, Austria and Switzerland. These pioneers supported Waverly&#x27;s many institutions which included a post office, bank, newspapers, city hall, churches, creamery, school, grain elevators, flouring mills, saw mill, insurance agencies, hotels, livery stables, general stores, hardware dealers, furniture shops, lumber companies, bakery, meat markets, millinery shops, saloons and a drugstore to name just a few.

Waverly moved faster and progressed farther in 30 years than some of its rival communities. Some claim that Waverly&#x27;s businesses and buildings were some of the largest and finest in Wright County at their height of development. One historical account stated that Waverly, &quot;is a pleasant, prosperous village, located on one of the very pleasant lakes; it is quite a summer resort for pleasure seekers...&quot; Records indicate that by 1909, the population of Waverly had expanded to over 1,000 residents.

Since its incorporation, Waverly has changed both physically and demographically. Like many similar rural communities of greater Minnesota, Waverly has felt the documented socio-economic effects of industrialized agriculture, rural exodus of young residents to regional urban cores and aging population. Waverly hosted some small development in the 1930s and 40s and a small subdivision in the early 1960s. But by 1980, Waverly&#x27;s population had decreased to 470 persons. Direct results of this rural trend were merging, consolidating or vanishing institutions and businesses.

Academic researchers have indicated that small communities like Waverly are entering a period of transition and metamorphosis. The grain elevators that once identified Waverly are gone, and new residential housing developments have appeared. The Twin Cities Metropolitan Area that once seemed distant is now only a 40-minute car drive away.

From 2000 to 2007, Waverly attracted the attention of residential developers in a flurry. The large influx of new residents during this short time beckoned back to Waverly&#x27;s historical boom period prior to 1900. This time however, the growth was primarily housing. Several developments were platted, including Summerfields, Woodland Shores, Spring Meadows, Carrigan Meadows, Carrigan Estates and Windgate at Carrigan Lake. The population has increased by over 60 percent since 2000 to nearly 1,300 in 2010 after many decades of static to no growth. Waverly is now poised for future growth while continuing to maintain its small-town appeal.

The Waverly Village Hall, built in 1939, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Canby is a city in Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,795 at the 2010 census.

==History==
John Swenson, who secured a homestead on section 4 of Norman Township where now stands the City of Canby, was one of the early European settlers in the area. After erecting a claim shanty, for the convenience of his neighbors, he opened a little store in his cabin. In November 1874, he secured the establishment of a post office in that store. At Swenson&#x27;s suggestion, the post office was named Canby, in honor of Civil War and career officer General Edward Canby of the United States Army. (General Canby had been assassinated the prior year during peace negotiations with the Modoc Tribe of Northern California.)

However, in 1876 the surrounding country was receiving new settlers and the railway company deemed it time to begin the operation of train service over the western part of the line. Canby Station was established and on August 24, 1876, and the city platted by the Winona &amp; St. Peter Railroad Company soon after the railroad was extended to that point. Because of its location on the rail line, Canby grew quickly and was incorporated as a village in 1879 and as a city in 1905.

Lots were sold by the railroad with the provision that they must be built upon within six months. Swenson was the first to buy, and he selected the corner of Front and Main for his first store building.

Grasshoppers, natives, and prairie fires were a big concern for Canby residents at this time. 1875 was the summer of the first bad grasshopper plague. The settlers tried everything they could think of to make them go away but the grasshoppers devoured every blade of grass, the leaves on the trees and even clustered on buildings.

Natives were on everyone&#x27;s mind because of General Custer&#x27;s campaign in Wyoming. On June 25, 1876, 3,000 braves circled and killed Custer and his 277 troops. Not long after the battle, a band of about 100 natives camped along the railroad track in Canby to trade furs for merchandise. The group soon left without incident.

Firebreaks were plowed around the town and each farmstead because settlers were ever alert to prairie fires.  In 1893 it wasn&#x27;t a prairie fire but a common daily task that started a fire in town. It began with filling a kerosene lamp from a tin measure. Fate and the wind were against Canby that night. After the flames had demolished every Main street store between the Swenson building and the bank, the wind switched and blew the heat and sparks across Main street to Block 3 where every structure went except for one.

A loss of $150,000 was reported but Canby built right up again and the structures were replaced with brick or stone construction. Because of the uniquely preserved architecture of these buildings the downtown area has been designated as a nationally registered historic district. The corner piece of this district as well as the oldest building, which was not destroyed in the fire, is located on the corner of Highway 75 and 2nd Street.

The first sermon was preached in Canby in 1876, however, in 1879 the first regular religious service in the English language was held. The first school was started in 1877 and located on the second floor of a home. The Canby News was founded in September 1878; it was the westernmost newspaper on the railroad.  The cost of Canby&#x27;s government in 1888-1889 was $5,898.12.

The new century saw a lot of change in Canby and all over the world.  Businesses changed hands and many new ones were established. It was a time of amazing growth in Canby.  In 1915, 50 new homes were built. It was a pre-war boom.  Post-war also saw a lot of changes. In 1930 motorized power and electrical power were taking place. A count of businesses in 1940 found 157 business places in Canby.

In 1946, after World War II, there was again a shortage of housing in Canby. In 1947, 55 building permits were issued. The following years were all “building years” and showed a lot of growth for Canby.

The population of Canby showed its largest growth in the 1930s and reached its peak in 1950.

Farmers have cultivated the area around Canby since the first settlers arrived in the middle of the 19th century. Farms and agriculture related businesses – both large and small, provide opportunities for various types of employment. Canby, realizing the importance of “farming,” continues to create new ways to promote the area&#x27;s farming industry to insure the community&#x27;s sustainability in the future.

Porter was founded in 1881 by Scandinavian settlers. The town&#x27;s heritage is still celebrated today with the annual Lutefisk, Lefse and Swedish Meatball Supper at Bethel Lutheran Church (Porter Norwegian Lutheran Church) in early November.

Auctions highlight a tradition in Porter. In January the long-standing Porter March of Dimes auction takes place at the Porter Community Hall. The fundraiser has been an annual event for over 70 years. Porter celebrates its annual Market Day Sale in April. The annual auction draws thousands to the town and shuts down streets for auction rings. The auction is a pre-World War II tradition that carries on to this day. As has been tradition for the over 90 years of the auction, homemade pies and sandwiches are still served in the Porter Community Hall by the Bethel Lutheran Church and food stands are operated by the Deb&#x27;s Café and various Porter organizations throughout the auction grounds.

In August the community celebrates the bountiful harvests of the community with our Harvest Festival. The event has been held on the 3rd weekend in August for over 50 years.

<text>Natchez ( ) is the only city in and the county seat of Adams County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 14,520 at the 2020 census. Located on the Mississippi River across from Vidalia, Louisiana, Natchez was a prominent city in the antebellum years, a center of cotton planters and Mississippi River trade.

Natchez is approximately southwest of the capital of Jackson and north of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, located on the lower Mississippi River. Natchez is the 28th-largest city in the state. The city was named for the Natchez people, who with their ancestors, inhabited much of the area from the 8th century AD through the French colonial period.

==History==
Established by French colonists in 1716, Natchez is one of the oldest and most important European settlements in the lower Mississippi River Valley. After the French lost the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War), they ceded Natchez and near territory to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris of 1763. (It later traded other territory east of the Mississippi River with Great Britain, which expanded what it called West Florida). The British Crown bestowed land grants in this territory to officers who had served with distinction in the war. These officers came mostly from the colonies of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. They established plantations and brought their upper-class style of living to the area.

Beginning 1779, the area was under Spanish colonial rule. After defeat in the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain ceded the territory to the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1783). Spain was not a party to the treaty, and it was their forces who had taken Natchez from British troops. Although Spain had been allied with the American colonists, they were more interested in advancing their power at the expense of Britain. Once the war was over, they were not inclined to give up that which they had acquired by force.

In 1797 Major Andrew Ellicott of the United States marched to the highest ridge in the young town of Natchez, set up camp, and raised the first American Flag claiming Natchez and all former Spanish lands east of the Mississippi above the 31st parallel for the United States.

After the United States acquired this area from the Spanish, the city served as the capital of the Mississippi Territory and then of the state of Mississippi. It predates Jackson by more than a century; the latter replaced Natchez as the capital in 1822, as it was more centrally located in the developing state. The strategic location of Natchez, on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River, ensured that it would be a pivotal center of trade, commerce, and the interchange of ethnic Native American, European, and African cultures in the region; it held this position for two centuries after its founding.

In U.S. history, Natchez is recognized particularly for its role in the development of the Old Southwest during the first half of the 19th century. It was the southern terminus of the historic Natchez Trace, with the northern terminus being Nashville, Tennessee. After unloading their cargoes in Natchez or New Orleans, many pilots and crew of flatboats and keelboats traveled by the Trace overland to their homes in the Ohio River Valley. (Given the strong current of the Mississippi River, it was not until steam-powered vessels were developed in the 1820s that travel northward on the river could be accomplished by large boats.) The Natchez Trace also played an important role during the War of 1812. Today the modern Natchez Trace Parkway, which commemorates this route, still has its southern terminus in Natchez.

In the decades preceding the Civil War, Natchez was by far the most prevalent slave trading city in Mississippi, and second in the United States only to New Orleans. The leading markets were located at the Forks of the Road, at the intersection of Liberty Road and Washington Road (now D&#x27;Evereux Drive and St. Catherine Street). In 1833, the most active slavers in the United States, John Armfield and Isaac Franklin began a program of arbitraging low slave prices in the Middle Atlantic area by sending thousands of slaves to Deep South markets in Natchez and New Orleans. Their company, Franklin and Armfield sent an annual caravan of slaves, called a coffle, from Virginia to the Forks of the Road in Natchez, as well as sending others by ship through New Orleans. Unlike other slave sellers of the day, Franklin and Armfield sold slaves individually, with the buyers allowed to survey the people much like items in a modern retail store.

In 1840, the city was struck by a devastating tornado that killed 317 people and injured 109. It ranks today as the second-deadliest tornado in U.S. history, although the death toll may be higher due to slave deaths not traditionally being counted in the South at that time.

In the middle of the nineteenth century, the city attracted wealthy Southern planters as residents, who built mansions to fit their ambitions. Their plantations were vast tracts of land in the surrounding lowlands along the river fronts of Mississippi and Louisiana, where they grew large commodity crops of cotton and sugarcane using slave labor. Natchez became the principal port from which these crops were exported, both upriver to Northern cities and downriver to New Orleans, where much of the cargo was exported to Europe. Many of the mansions built by planters before 1860 survive and form a major part of the city&#x27;s architecture and identity. Agriculture remained the primary economic base for the region until well into the twentieth century.

During the American Civil War Natchez was surrendered by Confederate forces without a fight in September 1862. Following the Union victory at the Battle of Vicksburg in July 1863, many refugees, including former slaves, freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, began moving into Natchez and the surrounding countryside. The Union Army officers claimed to be short on resources and unable to provide for the refugees. The Army planned to address the situation with a mixture of paid labor for freed slaves on government leased plantations, the enlistment of able-bodied males who were willing to fight in the Union Army and the establishment of refugee camps where former slaves could be provided with education. However, as the war continued, the plan was never effectively implemented and the leased plantations were crowded, poorly managed and frequently raided by Confederate troops who controlled the surrounding territory. Hundreds of people living in Natchez, including many former slaves and refugees, died of hunger, disease, overwork or were killed in the fighting during this period. In order to manage the tens of thousands of freed Black slaves, the Union Army created a refugee camp in Natchez in a natural pit known as the Devil&#x27;s Punchbowl, where thousands died of starvation, smallpox, and other diseases.

After the American Civil War, the city&#x27;s economy rapidly revived, mostly due to Natchez having been spared the destruction visited upon many other parts of the South. From 1870 to 1871, Robert H. Wood served as Mayor of Natchez; he was the one of only five African Americans to serve as mayor during the Reconstruction-era, and he was one of the first black mayors in the entire country. Natchez was also home to politicians Hiram Rhodes Revels and John R. Lynch, both African Americans.

The vitality of the city and region was captured most significantly in the 80 years or so following the war by the photographers Henry C. Norman and his son Earl. The output of the Norman Studio between roughly 1870 and 1950 documents this period in Natchez&#x27;s development vividly; the photographs are now preserved as the Thomas and Joan Gandy Collection in special collections of the library of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

During the twentieth century, the city&#x27;s economy experienced a downturn, first due to the replacement of steamboat traffic on the Mississippi River by railroads in the early 1900s, some of which bypassed the river cities and drew away their commerce. Later in the 20th century, many local industries closed in a restructuring that sharply reduced the number of jobs in the area. Despite its status as a popular destination for heritage tourism because of well-preserved antebellum architecture, Natchez has had a general decline in population since 1960. It remains the principal city of the Natchez micropolitan area.

Various movies have been shot here, including &quot;The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman&quot; (1974), &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1986), &quot;Raintree County&quot; (1957), &quot;Horse Soldiers&quot; (1959), &quot;Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1981), 
&quot;The Ladykillers&quot; (2004),&quot; Get On Up&quot; (2014) and &quot;Ma (film)&quot; (2019).

In the opening narration of &quot;The Apartment&quot; (1960), C.C. Baxter mentions the company he works for &quot;has 31,259 employees, which is more than the entire population of Natchez, Mississippi.&quot;

Ta-Nehisi Coates&#x27; 2019 novel, &quot;The Water Dancer&quot;, alludes constantly to the threat, in antebellum Virginia, represented to slaves by the possibility of being sold &quot;down Natchez way,&quot; that is, into harshest slavery.

<text>Corinth is a city in and the county seat of Alcorn County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 14,573 at the 2010 census. Its ZIP codes are 38834 and 38835. It lies on the state line with Tennessee.

== History ==
Established in 1853, Corinth was first named Cross City for its location at the junction of the Mobile &amp; Ohio and Memphis &amp; Charleston railroads, it was renamed Corinth after the famous Greek crossroads city. Because of the town’s strategic location, it was a center of contention between Union and Confederate forces during the Civil War and was ultimately occupied by Union troops from 1862 to 1864.

Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard retreated to Corinth after the Battle of Shiloh (April 1862), pursued by Union Major General Henry W. Halleck. General Beauregard abandoned the town on May 29 when General Halleck approached, letting it fall into the Union&#x27;s hands. Since Halleck had approached so cautiously, digging entrenchments at every stop for over a month, this action has been known as the Siege of Corinth.

The Union sent Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans to Corinth as well and concentrated its forces in the city. The Second Battle of Corinth took place on October 3−4, 1862, when Confederate Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn attempted to retake the city. Corinth ultimately became a destination for refugees from slavery called &quot;contrabands&quot; and their camp was &quot;widely regarded as a &#x27;model&#x27; camp.&quot;

<text>Gloster is a town in central Amite County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 897 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Gloster was incorporated on March 11, 1884.

It was largely founded as a railroad town. Gloster was named after the engineer who put the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley R.R. through in the 1880s.

Drax Biomass operates a per year wood pellet production facility in Gloster. The facility was expected to create 45 jobs, and is called Amite BioEnergy.

=== Economic revival ===
Governor Tate Reeves of Mississippi came down to Gloster to announce Claw Forestry Services will build a $200 million sawmill on about 50 acres comprising the former Georgia-Pacific mill site and the adjoining former elementary school property. The elementary school has been closed for many years. Mayor Jerry Norwood said the announcement is &quot;one of the proudest moments in my life, and my proudest moment as mayor.&quot; 

William VanDevender, chief executive officer of Claw, said once the plant is up and running, it should produce about 250 million board-feet of lumber a year, using about 1 million tons of logs annually, and make sales of more than $100 million a year. VanDevender and other Claw officials &quot;recognize the quality of the workforce and the quality of the timber basket in Southwest Mississippi,&quot; Reeves said after the presentation. &quot;This will benefit not just the 130 families that have workers at the plant, but boost timber owners across a four to five-county region.&quot;

Governor Reeves said he &quot;expects Southwest Mississippi Community College will play a large role in providing training for employees at the plant.

Gloster Forestry announced: &quot;In connection with the new sawmill facility, efforts are underway to resume operation of the Gloster Southern Railroad to further revitalize industry and jobs in the underserved community.&quot;

The new sawmill facility started operation in 2024. Also a grant of $52,000,000 was received to rebuild the Gloster Southern Railroad on the existing right-of-way.

==Demographics==

===Population===
According to the 2020 census, there were 897 people in Gloster. As of the census of 2010, there were 960 people, 223 households, and 114 families residing in the town.

=== Race ===

In 2010, the racial makeup of the town was 54.99% African American, 44.18% White, 0.56% from other races, and 0.28% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.77% of the population.

<text>Liberty is a town in Amite County, Mississippi. It is part of the McComb, Mississippi micropolitan statistical area. It is the county seat of Amite County.

The town can be accessed via I-55, then west on Mississippi Highway 24. McGehee Air Park is located about a mile west of town.

Liberty celebrates its Heritage Days Festival during the first weekend of each May.

Air Cruisers manufacturing plant is located in Liberty. Owned by Zodiac Aerospace, the plant produces evacuation slides, life rafts, and life vests for the aviation industry.

Eleven sites in or near Liberty are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
Liberty was incorporated on February 24, 1809. The Amite County Courthouse in Liberty is the oldest in Mississippi. Erected in 1839, the courthouse was enlarged and modernized in 1936. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Amite Female Seminary (also known as the &#x27;Little Red Schoolhouse&#x27;), built in 1853, was a girls finishing school located in Liberty. During the American Civil War, in the spring of 1863, Federal troops under the command of Colonel Benjamin Grierson, a former music teacher, burned the school, but spared the school&#x27;s music building. The Federal commander permitted musical instruments to be removed, and was prepared to give the order to torch the building, when he recognized the music school&#x27;s director, Rev. Milton Shirk, as a former classmate from New York. The two-story, two-room music building survives to this day on Mississippi Highway 569, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Gail Borden, who developed a process in the early 1850s for condensing milk and founded the New York Condensed Milk Company (later known as Borden Inc., lived in Liberty from 1822 to 1829.

Between 1904 and 1921, a branch of the Liberty–White Railroad, a narrow-gauge logging rail line serving the White Lumber Company, ran between McComb, Mississippi and Liberty.

During the Civil Rights Movement, in September 1961, Herbert Lee, an African-American dairy farmer and member of NAACP, was murdered in Liberty at the Westbrook Cotton Gin by E.H. Hurst, a white state legislator. Lee had attended voter registration classes and volunteered to try to register to vote, Witnesses to the killing were intimidated by armed white men in the courtroom to support Hurst&#x27;s claim of self-defense, and he was released without charges. Louis Allen, a married African-American landowner with a logging business, reported the truth about the crime to federal officials while seeking protection for testimony. He did not get protection. He suffered economic blackmail, arrests and harassment, and was killed in January 1964.

Liberty was the location of the fourth-wettest tropical cyclone in Mississippi in 2001; Tropical Storm Allison dropped of precipitation.

Liberty, Texas is thought to have been named after this town, as numerous families from Amite County moved west in the 1820s to settle in the Atascosito district north-east of Houston.

<doc id="122218" wikidata="Q1962164" url="?curid=122218" title="Snow Lake Shores, Mississippi">
<text>Snow Lake Shores is a town in Benton County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 319 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Snow Lake Shores is located along Mississippi Highway 4 in west-central Benton County, approximately west of Ashland and northeast of Holly Springs.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 24.13%, is water. The town consists of homes built around Snow Lake, an impoundment on Big Snow Creek, a tributary of the Tippah River and ultimately the Tallahatchie River.

==History==
The first Anglo settlers in the area were John M. Ferrell and his wife, who moved from Tennessee to a site west of present-day Snow Lake Shores in 1839. One of their ten children, Emaline, married an Englishman – Joe Shone. They built a house two miles east of the Ferrell homestead that became known as Shone&#x27;s Pond. The area around Shone&#x27;s Pond consisted mostly of marsh and cypress swamps. The names Shone&#x27;s Mill and Shone&#x27;s Mill Pond were sometimes applied to the area in its early years.

In 1947, New Yorker Walter Utley moved to neighboring Marshall County with plans to build a resort-style development in the area. Big Snow Creek with its three forks looked to be a good prospect. Around 1956, a partnership of three men – including Utley – organized to develop a residential subdivision that became known as Snow Lake Shores. In 1957, Big Snow Lake was created by building a dam on a local stream. Snow Lake Shores was established in 1958 as a private, restricted resort community. It was marketed as a safe, family-friendly place for people to both vacation and live year-round. A volunteer fire department was created in 1974.

After 38 years of existence, Snow Lake Shores was incorporated as a town in 1996. Incorporation meant that the town would be eligible to receive grants for paving roads and installing a new water system. Eddie Koen was appointed as the first mayor of Snow Lake Shores along with five aldermen who served as the new town&#x27;s governing body until municipal elections were held in October 1996.

Although the permanent resident population of Snow Lake Shores stands at around 300, that figure can grow to over 900 during the summer months as seasonal residents and vacationers come to the community.

<text>Beulah is a town in Bolivar County, Mississippi, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 242.

Beulah is served by Mississippi Highway 1. Lake Beulah, an oxbow lake formerly connected to the Mississippi River, is west of the town. The Illinois Central Railroad had a station in Beulah, but the line is now abandoned.

Beulah is named after the Christian hymn &quot;Beulah Land&quot;, a favorite of Frank A. Montgomery, an early settler to western Bolivar County.

==History==
The land southwest of Beulah was owned by a Choctaw family in the 1830s. A series of lawsuits caused them to lose their land, and Charles Clark took ownership. Clark established the Doro Plantation during the late 1840s and early 1850s, which grew to over and became the most prosperous slave-owning plantation in the region. It continued to operate after the end of slavery until 1913. During that time, the Mississippi River flowed next to Beulah along &quot;Beulah Bend&quot; (now Lake Beulah), and Clark was often visited by Mark Twain while writing &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;.

In 1858, Frank A. Montgomery purchased a tract of land along the river north of the Doro Plantation and established a plantation. Beulah was one of its villages.

Mississippi River boats landed at points in the community, and there was a noted river trade. Freshwater clam harvesting – &quot;clammin&quot; – enabled a thriving pearl button industry.

In 1863, Union soldiers altered the course of the river by constructing a channel to avoid Beulah Bend, and the town became shut off from river commerce. The pearl button industry declined, as freshwater clams tend to concentrate in the bends of rivers, though many families still participate in clam harvesting at places they can access the river. Altering the river&#x27;s course also destroyed the nearby towns of Prentiss and Napoleon.

In 1866, Montgomery donated the village of Beulah to the county, and gave $1,600 to build a courthouse. A two-room log jail was also built. Beulah became the first county seat, and had a Masonic Lodge, church, school, bank, stores, and post office. The &quot;Bolivar Times&quot; newspaper was also edited there. In 1872, the county seat was moved to Floreyville (now called Rosedale).

After the Civil War, numerous freedmen bought and cleared land in the bottomlands away from the river. By 1910, declining financial and social conditions had caused most to lose their land, forcing them to work as sharecroppers and laborers. Beginning in the early 1900s, thousands of blacks left Mississippi as part of the Great Migration north by railroad to Chicago and other northern industrial cities, but others remained, with strong local ties.

Blues musician W. C. Handy once invited Charley Patton to watch his band perform in Beulah. Patton got in free, and when he observed that Handy&#x27;s musicians were all strict score-reading performers, he gave up all ambition of playing with their band.

Beulah was mentioned in Eudora Welty&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Traveling Salesman&quot;:Bowman had wanted to reach Beulah by dark, to go to bed and sleep off his fatigue. As he remembered, Beulah was fifty miles away from the last town, on a graveled road. This was only a cow trail. How had he ever come to such a place? One hand wiped the sweat from his face, and he drove on.

In 1970, Beulah was chosen as the site for a large event by the Southern Female Rights Union.

Part of the movie &quot;Crossroads&quot; was filmed in Beulah.

<text>Mound Bayou is a city in Bolivar County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 1,533 at the 2010 census, down from 2,102 in 2000. It was founded as an independent black community in 1887 by former slaves led by Isaiah Montgomery. Mound Bayou Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Mound Bayou has a 96.8% African-American majority population in 2020, one of the largest of any community in the United States.

==History==
Mound Bayou traces its origin to freed African Americans from the community of Davis Bend, Mississippi. Davis Bend was started in the 1820s by planter Joseph E. Davis (elder brother of former Confederate president Jefferson Davis), who intended to create a model slave community on his plantation. Davis was influenced by the utopian ideas of Robert Owen. He encouraged self-leadership in the slave community, provided a higher standard of nutrition and health and dental care, and allowed slaves to become merchants. In the aftermath of the Civil War, Davis Bend became an autonomous free community when Davis sold his property to former slave Benjamin Montgomery, who had run a store and been a prominent leader at Davis Bend. The prolonged agricultural depression, falling cotton prices, flooding by the Mississippi River, and white hostility in the region contributed to the economic failure of Davis Bend.

Isaiah T. Montgomery led the founding of Mound Bayou in 1887 in northwest Mississippi. The bottomlands of the Delta were a relatively undeveloped frontier, and freedmen had a chance to make money by clearing land and using the profits to buy lands in such frontier areas. In 1892, the Mound Bayou Normal Institute, a black school was founded by the American Missionary Association.

African Americans throughout the United States celebrated the Mound Bayou example. In 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his train to make a special stop in the town. From the platform, he proclaimed that he was witnessing “an object lesson full of hope for the colored people and therefore full of hope for the white people, too.” Four years later, Booker T. Washington, in a speech to a crowd of thousands, hailed Mound Bayou as a “place where a Negro may get inspiration by seeing what other members of his race have accomplished...[and] where he has an opportunity to learn some of the fundamental duties and responsibilities of social and civic life.” 

By 1900 two-thirds of the owners of land in the bottomlands were black farmers. With the loss of political power due to state disenfranchisement, high debt and continuing agricultural problems, most of them lost their land and by 1920 were landless sharecroppers. As cotton prices fell, the town suffered a severe economic decline in the 1920s and 1930s.

Shortly after a fire destroyed much of the business district, Mound Bayou began to revive in 1942 after the opening of the Taborian Hospital by the International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor, a fraternal organization. For more than two decades, under its Chief Grand Mentor Perry M. Smith, the hospital provided low-cost health care to thousands of black people in the Mississippi Delta. The chief surgeon was T.R.M. Howard, who eventually became one of the wealthiest black men in the state. Howard owned a plantation of more than , a home-construction firm, and a small zoo, and he built the first swimming pool for black people in Mississippi.

In 1952, Medgar Evers moved to Mound Bayou to sell insurance for Howard&#x27;s Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. Howard introduced Evers to civil rights activism through the Regional Council of Negro Leadership which organized a boycott against service stations that refused to provide restrooms for black people. The RCNL&#x27;s annual rallies in Mound Bayou between 1952 and 1955 drew crowds of ten thousand or more. During the trial of Emmett Till&#x27;s killers, black reporters and witnesses stayed in Howard&#x27;s Mound Bayou home, and Howard gave them an armed escort to the courthouse in Sumner.

Author Michael Premo wrote:
Mound Bayou was an oasis in turbulent times. While the rest of Mississippi was violently segregated, inside the city there were no racial codes ... At a time when blacks faced repercussions as severe as death for registering to vote, Mound Bayou residents were casting ballots in every election. The city has a proud history of credit unions, insurance companies, a hospital, five newspapers, and a variety of businesses owned, operated, and patronized by black residents. Mound Bayou is a crowning achievement in the struggle for self-determination and economic empowerment.

<doc id="122228" wikidata="Q2065882" url="?curid=122228" title="Rosedale, Mississippi">
<text>Rosedale is a city in Bolivar County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 1,873 at the 2010 census, down from 2,414 in 2000. Located in an agricultural area, the city had a stop on the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad, which carried many migrants north out of the area in the first half of the 20th century.

==History==
Rosedale was settled around 1838 and became one of the two county seats in 1872. This area was developed by European American planters for extensive cotton plantations, dependent on enslaved laborers. After the Civil War and emancipation, some freedmen managed to clear and buy land in the bottomlands, with many becoming landowners before the end of the nineteenth century. By 1910, a lengthy recession and declining economic and political conditions resulted in most blacks in the state losing their land. They could not compete with the financing gained by railroads, which were constructed in the area beginning in 1882 Many stayed in the area to work as sharecroppers and laborers. The railroad brought new business to Rosedale, which had a depot and shipped cotton to northern and other markets. Rosedale incorporated as a town February 2, 1882 and became a city in 1930.

Beginning in the early twentieth century, tens of thousands of blacks left the state of Mississippi as part of the Great Migration, north by railroad to Chicago and other Midwestern industrial cities. During and after World War II, others went to California to work in the defense industry. Others remained where their families had lived for generations, with strong local ties.

In 2007, the Mississippi Blues Commission placed a historic marker at Rosedale&#x27;s former Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad depot site, designating it as a site on the Mississippi Blues Trail. The marker commemorates the sites in the original lyrics of legendary blues artist Robert Johnson&#x27;s song &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues&quot;. He traced the railway route which ran south from Friars Point to Rosedale among other stops, including Vicksburg and north to Memphis. The marker emphasizes that a common theme of blues songs was riding on the railroad, which was seen as a metaphor for travel and escape from poverty and Jim Crow in the Delta. It also commemorates another common blues theme, life on the banks of a moody river bank, a theme heard in Charlie Patton&#x27;s &quot;High Water Everywhere&quot;.

Locals claim that Johnson sold his soul to the Devil at the intersection of Mississippi state highways 1 and 8, on the south end of town, and that he tells this story metaphorically in &quot;Cross Road Blues.&quot; Other artists have referred to his songs. Johnson&#x27;s deal with the Devil is mentioned as occurring in Rosedale in 1930 in an episode of the TV series &quot;Supernatural.&quot; However, a number of other Delta municipalities claim that the transaction took place in or near their boundaries.

==Geography==
Rosedale is located northwest of Cleveland.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Rosedale has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.14%, is water.

Rosedale is situated on the eastern side of the Mississippi River, approximately midway between the mouths of the Arkansas and White rivers, which flow into the Mississippi from the Arkansas (western) side.
