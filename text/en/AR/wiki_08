<text>Ellsworth is a city in and the county seat of Hancock County, Maine, United States. The 2020 Census determined it had a population of 8,399. Named after United States Founding Father Oliver Ellsworth, it contains historic buildings and other points of interest, and is close to Acadia National Park.

==History==

According to the history of the Passamaquoddy people, the Ellsworth area was originally inhabited by members of the Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes: &quot;Both groups speak closely related Algonquian languages, although anthropologists generally group the Passamaquoddies linguistically with the Maliseets and the Penobscots with the Abenakis.&quot; History

George J. Varney, in the &quot;Hancock County, Maine&quot; section of his &quot;Gazetteer of the State of Maine&quot;, published in Boston in 1886, wrote:

It is likely that the French who founded a colony at Somes Sound on Mount Desert Island in 1613, under the patronage of Madame de Guercheville, explored the Ellsworth area and what is now the watershed of the Union River. Varney believes that there were French settlements of some kind or another as close to Ellsworth as Trenton, Oak Point, Newbury Neck and Surry.

The Ellsworth area was disputed between the English and the French throughout the 17th century and well into the 18th century, occasioning intermittent warfare which was known to the English as the French and Indian Wars. Native American inhabitants may have converted to Roman Catholicism and fought with the French against the British until the fall of Quebec City to the British in 1759. After the 1763 signing of the Treaty of Paris by the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal, Ellsworth became part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

The modern history of Ellsworth begins with the settlement of the Union River area around 1763 by a party of English led by entrepreneurs Benjamin Milliken and Benjamin Joy, from present-day southern Maine and New Hampshire, who intended to build dams and sawmills to exploit the area&#x27;s timber and water power. They applied for grants offered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to encourage settlement of the Hancock County area. Historian Albert H. Davis in his &quot;History of Ellsworth, Maine&quot;, published in Lewiston, Maine, in 1927, relates what is known of this early expedition and points to the northern end of the present Water Street, just to the south of the present bridge across the Union River, as the site of the earlier crude buildings erected by the pioneers.

George J. Varney describes the process of land grants by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:

In 1773 the first schooner was built at Ellsworth. This was the Susan and Abigail, named after daughters of the two most prominent citizens, American Loyalist Benjamin Milliken and Benjamin Joy. The vessel carried pine shingles and oak staves in annual voyages to the West Indies. In the years up to the beginning of the 20th century, many schooners of various sizes were built in Ellsworth shipyards along the Union River.

Albert Davis records that in the latter part of the 18th century, Ellsworth was known as the Union River Settlement and was adjacent to the settlements of Surry (to the east) and Trenton (to the south). Later it was organized as Plantation No. 7 and at times called Bowdoin and New Bowdoin. In 1798 the inhabitants petitioned to be incorporated under the name Sumner. That name having been already taken by a settlement in present-day Oxford County, Maine, the town was incorporated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1800 as Ellsworth, named for Oliver Ellsworth, the Connecticut delegate to the 1787 National Convention that was then working on a Constitution for the new United States of America, and later the third Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Oliver Ellsworth is thought to be first to suggest the name &quot;United States of America&quot;.

Davis reports that in the late 1770s, there were British raids on the Union River Settlement, with attempts to appropriate local cattle. However, there were no formal battles in the Ellsworth area during the Revolutionary War.

In 1838, Ellsworth became the county seat of Hancock County, replacing Castine. The 1838 county buildings still stand, west of the Union River, on Bridge Hill.

In 1859, when the town&#x27;s population was 4,009, industries included nine sawmills, two gristmills, one tannery, one carding machine, one pottery maker, eight brickyards, thirteen shipbuilders, five pail factories, two edge tool factories, one carriage manufacturer and eight box-making establishments.

Between 1860 and 1865, Ellsworth sent 653 soldiers to fight in the Civil War, according to historian Albert Davis. This was at a time when there were only 847 (male) voters in the area. Military training was held in front of the county buildings on Bridge Hill, west of the Union River, at the site of the present Civil War Monument.

In 1869, Ellsworth was incorporated as a city by the Maine Legislature. The first City Hall was Hancock Hall, which stood at the corner of Main Street and School Street. It was destroyed by the Great Ellsworth Fire of 1933.

In 1888, electricity was introduced into the Ellsworth area.

The disputed city elections in 1896 resulted in the appointment of two separate Ellsworth police forces, each of which threatened to arrest the other.

Work on the Ellsworth hydro-electric dam began in 1907, at the site of one of the original Benjamin Milliken Union River dams. This led to the creation of the present Leonard&#x27;s Lake just north of the city.

Ellsworth&#x27;s first disaster of the 20th century was the Great Flood of 1923. A spring freshet rushed over the dam and carried off the metal Union River Bridge, along with many buildings along the river, such as the Dirigo Theater, the Foundry and many wharves and warehouses. This event marked the end of Ellsworth&#x27;s prominence as a shipping center. The present concrete bridge was finished in 1924.

The Great Fire of 1933 destroyed most of Ellsworth&#x27;s downtown commercial district, on the east side of the Union River. New buildings were built in brick, mainly in Art Deco style. The unique Ellsworth City Hall dates from this period. Many old houses outside the business district survived the conflagration.

The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of an Ellsworth business district on High Street, which is the direct route to and from Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. This area is now the largest shopping district in Hancock County, with several shopping centers and many large stores, stretching nearly to the Ellsworth-Trenton boundary.

===Climate===
Ellsworth has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) of the warm summer type. As much of Maine winters are harsh and snowy throughout the season, even being at latitudes similar to southern France, such discrepancies are due to the western patterns and the Labrador Current. In places to the northwest of the city, as around Branch Lake, the USDA hardiness zone is 5a, while in the urban area it is 5b, as is much of the state&#x27;s coastline.

<text>Hancock is a town in Hancock County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,466 at the 2020 census. Located on the mainland at the head of Frenchman Bay, Hancock has commanding views of Mount Desert Island.

==History==

It was first settled in 1766 by Philip and S. Hodgkins from Georgetown. Formed from portions of Sullivan, Trenton and Plantation No. 8, the town was incorporated by the state legislature on February 21, 1828 and named for John Hancock, signer of the Declaration of Independence. It had two water power sites to operate mills—the Kilkenny and Egypt streams. There was one gristmill, four shingle mills and four lath mills. Other products included staves, lumber, boots, shoes, wagons and sleighs. Many inhabitants were engaged in seafaring, particularly fishing at the Grand Banks.

During World War II, German spies Erich Gimpel and William Colepaugh landed by submarine in Hancock, then traveled to New York City. These spies would eventually be captured, tried, and sentenced to death before their sentences were commuted and they were eventually released.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Drained by the Kilkenny Stream and Egypt Stream, Hancock is situated on Skillings River, Taunton Bay and Frenchman Bay, part of the Atlantic Ocean.

The town is crossed by U. S. Route 1 and State Route 182. It borders the towns of Lamoine to the south, Ellsworth to the west, T8 SD to the north, Franklin to the east, and (separated by Taunton Bay and Frenchman&#x27;s Bay) is near Sullivan and Sorrento to the southeast.

The Municipality (the entirety of the Town&#x27;s area) is considered, generally, to be divided in to a few distinct divisions or areas:

Waukeag Neck—which includes the villages of neighborhoods of Hancock Point, Mount Desert Ferry, East Hancock (&quot;Eastside&quot;), South Hancock (&quot;Westside&quot; or &quot;Westshore&quot;), Waukeag Station Crossing, and the Town proper (Hancock Village). &quot;The Neck&quot; is bounded by the Taunton River to the northeast, Frenchman&#x27;s Bay to the south, and Carrying Place Creek to the due west.

Mid-Hancock or Hancock Hills—which includes the villages or neighborhoods of Carrying Place Creek, Havey Point, Hyde Point, Hancock Hill (ORO or Old Route One Hill) and Franklin Roads. The area is largely coterminous with US Route One (US1 East) and is bounded by the Carrying Place Creek, Rte 1, and the Kilkenny Stream at Mud Creek Road.

Mud Creek—one of the smaller sections of town, the area abuts Kilkenny Stream and Pinkham Flats, adjacent to the town of Lamoine and includes the Mud Creek Marsh. This section includes neighborhoods such as Upper Mud Creek &amp; Kilkenny Cove.

Northside—bounded by Egypt Stream, Hog Bay, and Route 182, the area includes the neighborhoods and hamlets of Castle Grove (also known as Austinwood, Austin Castle, and Castle Road), West Egypt, Franklin Roads North, Blease Hill, Spring Pond, and Deerfields.

Western Hancock—the larger chunk of the town&#x27;s land area is adjacent to the City of Ellsworth and is generally thought to begin at the junction of Mud Creek Road and terminate at Washington Junction Rd and the city limits of Ellsworth and the town line with Lamoine. The area includes the neighborhoods of Washington Junction, Hancock Heights, Crescent Heights, and White Birches.

The summer colony of Hancock Point includes many historic properties, such as the Crocker House Country Inn, among a number summer cottages.

Hancock Village includes several historic or notable properties as well, such as Ironbound Inn &amp; Restaurant (formerly Le Domaine) and the Pierre Monteaux School. The village also includes commercial, administrative, and social facilities, such as the Grammar School, Hancock Congregational Church, the US Postal Service, the Municipal Hall, among others.

The Town serves as one of the crossroads of Eastern Maine, being adjacent to the Mount Desert Island, Ellsworth, Schoodic Peninsula, and Schoodic Foothills / Hog Bay Areas. With an incredible number of scenic spots overlooking MDI, Taunton &amp; Frenchman&#x27;s Bay, in addition to its location at the centre of the region, Hancock is a both an attraction in its own right, as well as a basecamp for travellers and tourists. Two of Acadia National Park&#x27;s most popular districts—Mount Desert Island and Schoodic Point—are approximately equidistant, and a short drive away. The Island Explorer&#x27;s Downeast &amp; Peninsula Routes pass through the community, connecting Bar Harbor, Ellsworth, and Winter Harbor.

With its convenient location, historic and charming neighborhoods, as well as its social and commercial facilities, Hancock is both a desirable bedroom community and business district adjacent to Eastern Maine&#x27;s shire town of Ellsworth and the popular Mount Desert Island &amp; Schoodic Peninsula Areas.

<text>Sedgwick is a town in Hancock County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,202 at the 2020 census. The town includes the village of Sargentville.

The countryside around Sedgwick is a haven for birdwatchers, as well as an out-of-the-way tourist stop with several bed and breakfast locations.

==History==
It was one of six contiguous townships, each six miles square, granted by Massachusetts in 1761 to David Marsh and 359 others. Called by its Abenaki name &quot;Naskeag,&quot; meaning &quot;the end or extremity,&quot; its first permanent European settler was Andrew Black in 1759. In 1789, the town was incorporated as Sedgwick, named after Major Robert Sedgwick, who in 1654 captured nearby Fort Pentagouet (now Castine) from the French.

In 1817, land was taken from the township to form Brooksville, with more taken in 1849 to form Brooklin. By 1859, the population was 1,235.

Farmers found the surface broken and ledgy, better suited for grazing than cultivation. Gristmills and sawmills were built along various streams, including the Benjamin River. Because of the geology, for decades Sedgwick had operating many granite quarries, where stone was taken for major public buildings. Most of the quarries have been abandoned. Two companies mined for argentiferous galena, a source of silver. But with two excellent harbors, the town was chiefly occupied by fishing, clam digging, shipbuilding and seafaring. Other businesses included tanning and barrel making.

In March 2011, Sedgwick received attention after passing an ordinance declaring food sovereignty for the town&#x27;s citizens.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Drained by the Benjamin River, which separates it from Brooklin, Sedgwick overlooks Penobscot Bay. The Deer Isle Bridge spans the Eggemoggin Reach, connecting Sedgwick to the towns of Deer Isle and Stonington.

The town is crossed by state routes 15, 172, 175 and 176.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Sedgwick has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Stonington is a town in Hancock County, Maine, United States. It is located on the southern portion of the island of Deer Isle. The population was 1,056 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of Burnt Cove, Oceanville, Green Head, and Clam City. A picturesque working waterfront and tranquil tourist destination in eastern Penobscot Bay, Stonington has consistently ranked among the top lobster ports in the country and is the largest lobster port in Maine. In 2011, 14,854,989 pounds of lobster were landed by Stonington fishermen, with a value of $46.3 million.

==History==
===Deer Isle settlement===
As far back as 6,100 years ago the first inhabitants of Deer Isle were Native Americans known as the Abenaki, speaking a language called Etchemin. One of the first Europeans to explore the area was Estevan Gomez, a Portuguese working for the Spanish Crown. Gomez sailed his ship &quot;La Anunciada&quot; up the Eggemoggin Reach, amongst other places along the Maine coast, looking for gold and the Northwest Passage. It was the French, however, who would be the most active in the region. Establishing a fort at Castine and intermarrying with Abenaki natives. A body buried in full French armor was discovered on nearby Campbell Island (+44° 13&#x27; 20.03&quot;, −68° 36&#x27; 33.24&quot;, south of Oak Point).

The first white settler of Deer Isle was one William Eaton (born 1720 Salisbury, Massachusetts, died Seabrook, New Hampshire) and family, arriving on the island prior to August 4, 1762. They settled in an area now known as Scott&#x27;s Landing (so named for the second owner of the property: Nathaniel Scott) located near the Deer Isle/Little Deer Isle Causeway. By 1765, migration to Deer Isle had begun in earnest and Eaton, along with 16 other families, petitioned the governing state of Massachusetts for legal title to the land. The largest group of these first settlers came from Newburyport, Massachusetts and were mostly of Scottish and Irish descent. Ironically, those settlers had come looking for a new life on the land, not the sea. A few cellar holes and foundation stones from the original homesteads can still be found at Scott&#x27;s Landing and the land they cleared is still open. Settlers continued their southward migration on the island and eventually established the village of Green&#x27;s Landing (as Stonington was initially known) after 1800.

=== Green&#x27;s Landing ===
==== Settlement ====
Hundred-acre &quot;proprietor lots&quot; were granted to those who first settled the island, accelerating the southward migration with the promise of new land. Within a few decades, the yields of acidic soil of the original proprietor lots began to decline and inhabitants of the island took to the sea. Green&#x27;s Landing, settled , was established by a few pioneering souls on the rocky, windswept southern shore of the island. That sparsely populated village became active in shipbuilding, seafaring, fishing and lobster fishing.

==== Granite ====
A barren settlement, Green&#x27;s Landing changed little in its first 70 or so years; , granite quarrying became a major occupation and little Green&#x27;s Landing became a boom town. Europeans, mainly from Italy, immigrated to Green&#x27;s Landing to implement their old-world skills as stonecutters and masons at the numerous &quot;in-town&quot; granite quarries. As the demand for stone increased, quarrying moved off-shore to the southerly surrounding islands. Crotch Island (+44° 8&#x27; 25.20&quot;, −68° 40&#x27; 17.26&quot;), the best known &quot;island&quot; quarry, was one of 33 major island quarries along the Maine coast, providing work for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people. Stone excavated in the area has been used to build important structures across the country, including the approaches to the Brooklyn Bridge (1880s), Croton Aqueduct (NY, 1880), Holyoke Dam (Holyoke, Massachusetts, 1890s), piers for Manhattan/Brooklyn Bridge (Manhattan, 1905), Museum of Fine Arts (Boston, 1907), Rockefeller fountain bowl (Pocantico, New York, 1913), John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame, (Arlington County, Virginia, 1966) and the new Yankee Stadium among many others. Some other major quarries in operation at the time were The Settlement Quarry (on Deer Isle), Green Island Quarry, and St. Helena Quarry (both separate island quarries). 

==== Boom town ====
Many of the new immigrants lived in hotels and large boarding houses built for that purpose at Green&#x27;s Landing, the current Tewksbury Building being one of many still in use. Some of these new migrants were housed in bunkhouses on Crotch Island itself. Prior to building the Deer Isle-Sedwick bridge and causeway in 1939, the settlement&#x27;s primary link to the outside world was Steamboat Wharf, located west of the main harbor. Once busy with vessels arriving daily from ports such as Rockland and Boston, it was the primary terminus for freight and passengers.

=== Lobstering and seafaring ===
Sailors on the island became renowned for their maritime skills. Full crews for two America&#x27;s Cup teams were recruited from Deer Isle for the victorious America&#x27;s Cup Races of 1895 on The Defender and again in 1899 on Columbia. The Stonington harbor has long been filled with Friendship Sloops among other boat designs, powered by sail only. Lobstermen once used them to haul traps. Most of their trips were to the outer islands (like York Island) near Isle au Haut, fishing during the week and returning to the harbor on weekends. This changed with the advent of gasoline or diesel engines, along with new hull designs, which enabled fishermen to make day trips to fishing grounds in Penobscot Bay.

=== Stonington incorporation ===

On February 18, 1897, Green&#x27;s Landing was set off and incorporated by the Maine State Legislature as Stonington—named for its granite quarries.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Located on the southern end of Deer Isle, Stonington is situated in Penobscot Bay and the Gulf of Maine, part of the Atlantic Ocean. Stonington is the southern terminus of State Route 15, which passes through the town of Deer Isle and across the Deer Isle Bridge to the mainland.

==General overview==

The Town of Sullivan&#x27;s offices are located on U.S. 1.

Sullivan, Maine, the gateway to the Schoodic Peninsula and the Downeast Acadia region, is composed of several villages and settlements, collectively termed &quot;the Sullivans&quot;, or colloquially as &quot;Sully&quot;—similar to other New England municipalities such as:

* West Sullivan – also reflected on the map as &quot;Sullivan&quot; (proper) is the village located on Taunton Bay where the US Rte 1 Bridge—part of the Downeast Acadia Highway, often referred to as the &#x27;Silent Bridge&#x27; a homage to the former &#x27;Singing Bridge&#x27; that was replaced by the current structure—connects Sullivan to the town of Hancock. Within the area are several homes dating back a century or more, as well as a public common or park (Sumner Memorial Park / the Village Green) and business. Adjacent to the Park is Greeley Hall, home to the Frenchman&#x27;s Bay Library, Sullivan-Sorrento Rec Centre and a playground complete with a skate park. Sullivan Municipal Building &amp; Townhall, located in the former Sullivan High School (turn of the century) is on US Rte 1 in West Sullivan, houses both the Town&#x27;s administration, historical society and a joint RSU24/University College (UMaine) center for CCTV courses.
* North Sullivan – also known as North Village and North Sully; located along on Taunton Trail/Drive, northwest of Gordon&#x27;s Wharf &amp; Track Road is a mainly residential area also on Taunton Bay. North Sullivan also includes a few art galleries, municipal services and the USPS. Once known for its granite quarrying shipped to cities such as Portland, Boston, and New York, London &amp; Hong Kong, North Sullivan is now a bedroom community for Ellsworth, Mount Desert Island and points Downeast. The Old Hooper Havey &amp; Crabtree Co Quarry is a favoured swimming hole for many area residents and exhibits artwork along the cliffs. Various other quarries are now on private land, with one formerly being the site of a retreat that included rental cabins along the edge of the water filled basins. 
* East Sullivan – spread along Frenchman&#x27;s Bay and reaching northeast into the Schoodic Foothills, East Sullivan multiple lakes and access to inland multipurpose recreation trails. Located primarily along US Route 1 (Downeast-Acadia Highway and Schoodic Peninsula Scenic Byway), the village also boasts farm plantations, Oceanhouse housing development, the Town Landing, a sub-regional high school of Maine&#x27;s Regional School Union #24 (Downeast Acadian Schools, administrated from Ellsworth), Sumner Memorial High School, along with a village fire department, and Scenic Stops along US Rte 1. East Sullivan is also home to a seasonal-art center housed in an old farmhouse barn, in addition to blueberry fields, piney forests, a grange hall, campground, and additional businesses. Tunk Lake, Donnell&#x27;s Pond, Flander&#x27;s Pond and Little Tunk Lake are recreational and nature preserve areas within East Sullivan. In 2020 it was reported that the campus of Sumner Memorial High School would be redeveloped; a new high school and junior high school facility would be constructed on land adjacent to the current structure and named the Charles Sumner Memorial Academic Campus. New names were proposed for the schools included Frenchman’s Bay Jr/Sr High School, Schoodic Peninsula High School (there is a Peninsula Elementary School in Gouldsboro-WH) and Schoodic Regional School. Voters district wide supported maintaining the Sumner Memorial name, out of historic respect to Dr Sumner who donated both the lands and funds, in addition to civic effort, to build the old school. East Sullivan will remain the heart of secondary education for the region. 
* Sullivan Harbor – at the heart of the municipality, Sullivan Harbor is home to some of the oldest homes in the town; Directly across Frenchman&#x27;s Bay from Bar Harbor and Mount Desert Island, Sullivan Harbor has long been home to many bed &amp; breakfasts, seasonal summer &#x27;cottages&#x27;, and businesses. Other local businesses have seen over the century and decades a resurgence of interest as tourists begin expanding beyond the well-known resort towns towards other niches. Sullivan Harbor&#x27;s Frenchman&#x27;s Bay Scenic Overlook provides travelers a pit stop panoramic view of Mount Desert Island and the Atlantic. The village boasts the aforementioned along with tennis courts, a general store (Dunbar&#x27;s) and the Municipal Boat Launch. Sullivan Harbor&#x27;s Old Granite Store building, an historic edifice that straddles the head of the harbor at the corner of US Rte 1 and Harbor view, is constructed of locally quarried granite dating back to the 1800s; the building was once a salt-storage facility, later part of a shipyard, a customs building or market house, and in the later 1900s home to a variety of ventures ranging from bed-and-breakfasts to artisan galleries or private residences. Various historic markers dot the area, and include photos of the rusticator era Waukeag House Hotel that once sat where the general store now does. Sullivan Harbor’s Wharf is accessible off Benevento Ave. The historic Sullivan Harbor Church stands on Harborside Drive. 
* Alderville Township &amp; Taunton Shores – along Franklin&#x27;s Hog Bay on South Bay Road are the communities of Alderville and the North Sullivan subdivision of Taunton Shores; residential areas located between Sullivan and Franklin have long been considered part of Sullivan though they tend to fall within the Town of Franklin&#x27;s limits. Home to the University of Maine Aquaculture Co-operative, Alderville Township is also home to an artisan gallery that has been a family owned business for roughly two decades.
* Punkinville – located inland between Long Cove and East Sullivan, Punkinville is a small, rural, residential hamlet.
* Ashville &amp; Morancy – off US Rte 1 (East) is the enclave of Ashville and further the Morancy Pond Settlements; primarily rural these villages are adjacent to the Sunrise Road Recreational Trail that runs from Machias, Maine (Washington County) through in-land Hancock County. Ashville is the location of one of the still-functioning historic chapels in Sullivan.

The town&#x27;s inland area along Rte 200 (Bert Grey Road) in to the Schoodic Foothills is a mainly wooded area that boasts commercial and residential value, in addition to being the location of the municipal grade school, Mountain View School (K–8) which—as part of Schoodic Community Schools and RSU24—provides education (primary, middle, and junior high) to the Towns of Sullivan, Sorrento, and Franklin.

Sullivan, Maine, as part of the Upper Schoodic Peninsula sub-region is a member of the Schoodic Peninsula Chamber of Commerce; Sullivan is located roughly 11 miles to nearby Winter Harbor, ME, and the Schoodic District of Acadia National Park. The Town is roughly 17 miles from the heart of Downtown Ellsworth, ME—the shire town of Hancock County—and approximately 35 miles by land from the Village Green in Bar Harbor, ME on Mount Desert Island, though from various points along its shoreline the Island can be easily seen and is, nautically and geographically, closer by sea than by land. Ferry Service is available to and from the Schoodic region and may be accessed semi-seasonally (on a schedule) or by appointment (by change) in nearby Winter Harbor; some resources available to visitors can be found by contacting local Harbor Masters or business. The Island Explorer Transit Service serves the Schoodic Peninsula with hubs in Winter Harbor, Ellsworth, and Bar Harbor.

=== In art, culture, and society ===

The Town of Sullivan, Maine&#x27;s villages were featured in the novel &quot;Seven Steeples&quot;, which focused on the communities that grew surrounding the Chapels and Churches that served them.

Sullivan Harbor was the inspiration for the setting of the novel &quot;The Tinker of Salt Cove&quot;.

West Sullivan was the scene of author Jack Havey&#x27;s memoir &quot;West Sullivan Days&quot;.

As with many semi-rural communities, Sullivan&#x27;s Villages were once semi-autonomous communities that became more integrated after the turn of the 19th century; some former stores, customs houses, post offices and chapels have been converted into residential or commercial properties.

The area, encompassing mostly nearby Hancock and Hancock Point, was featured as the filming location for part(s) of the film adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;.

The Schoodic Peninsula&#x27;s Upper Peninsula section transitions to the Lower Peninsula at the Gouldsboro/Sullivan town-line, while the demarcation between the Schoodic Foothills &amp; the Upper Peninsula is less formalized, but considered to end at the Franklin/Sullivan town-line and the transition from Taunton to Hog Bay via water. Formerly, the colonial term &quot;Schoodicshire&quot; has been used in ages-passed for the two regions collectively.

&quot;Schoodic&quot; is the anglicized form of a Native American term of disputed origin, thought to mean (in one definition cited locally) as &quot;where land and sea meet&quot;. Waukeag, the distinct name for the Sullivan area, also is of Native origin, and roughly translates to &quot;crossing place&quot; or &quot;horsehead&quot;, among other interpretations. Maine&#x27;s history as a disputed frontier territory between the British North American Colonies and French New France, and later a district of the Massachusetts Bay Colony (later Commonwealth) has provided the area with a distinctive, unique historic status.

==History==
The following information derives from George J. Varney&#x27;s &quot;A Gazetteer of the State of Maine&quot;, published in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1886:

Surry is situated on the west bank of Union River Bay, in Hancock County. On the north-east it is bounded by Ellsworth, on the south-west, by Blue Hill, on the west, by Orland and Penobscot. The town has an area of about . Toddy Pond forms part of the boundary between Surry and Penobscot, and on the line between Surry and Ellsworth are the two Patten ponds whose outlet is Patten Stream. Fishways were constructed to these ponds in 1872, and the ponds have since been stocked with alewives and salmon. The surface of the town is considerably broken. The land generally is valuable for tillage. The majority of the surface soil is so intermingled with comminuted quartz, or siliceous sand, that cranberries grow in the grass fields. The cultivation of this crop is receiving increased attention. A large deposit of nearly pure silica in the town may prove of much value for glass and other ware. A few years ago, a bleak profusion of granite boulders lay over miles of surface on the Toddy Pond road. Today those boulders are seen in every stage of ruin. On every hand they are smitten with decay, and here and there a patch of unworn gravel is all that remains of a once great boulder. A few miles beyond these is a field of immense boulders, still uncrumbled, lying in wild confusion boulder on boulder.

The manufactories of Surry are a lumber, shingle, spool and two stave mills. Formerly there was a large business done in building small vessels, but it is now very much reduced. Surry has two mining companies: the Blue Hill Bay and the East Surry Company.

Surry was Township No. 6, in the grant to Marsh and others. It was first occupied by the French at Newbury Neck. The first English settlers were Symonds, Weymouth and James Flye. The next settlers were John Patten, a Mr. Hopkinson, Andrew Flood, Wilbrahim Swett, Matthew and James Ray, Samuel Joy, Isaac Lord, Hezekiah Coggins and Leonard Jarvis. Mr. Jarvis represented the eastern district in Congress from 1831 to 1837.

Up to 1820, about had been secured to settlers and by quiet possession titles, when Mr. Jarvis bought the remainder. In 1800, Surry included that portion of Ellsworth known as Ward 5; but in 1829 it was re-annexed to Ellsworth. There was a population of 289 as early as 1790. In 1874, a small quantity of silver coin was found at Weymouth Point. Surry furnished 135 men to the Union cause in the war of the Rebellion!

The Baptist, Free Baptist and Methodist denominations have churches in town. There are nine public schoolhouses, and the school property is valued at $3,400. The valuation of estates in 1870 was $207,137. In 1880 it was $177,534. The population in 1870 was 1,242. In 1880 it was 1,185.&quot;

===Recent===
The National Weather Service in Caribou established a cooperative weather station at East Surry in July 2007. The NWS station, named Ellsworth-3SSW, serves as an official meteorological recording site, providing daily weather and climate information to the (NWS) National Weather Service, (NCDC) National Climatic Data Center, CoCoRaHS (Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow Network), and CWOP (Citizens Weather Observer Program). The station (Ellsworth-3SSW) continues the climate history of Ellsworth dating back to the 1930s. The cooperative station is located at an elevation of 105 feet, approximately two miles east of Surry village.

The NWS in Caribou renamed the station East Surry on July 1, 2011. This station begins a new climate history for East Surry, as it was found to be incompatible to the old ELLSWORTH POLL CONTROL station. The new data set begins on June 1, 2007, from the East Surry location.

<text>Verona Island is a town located on an island of the same name in the Penobscot River in Hancock County, Maine, United States. The population was 507 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The island and community has undergone numerous name changes. It was originally Penobscot Island, part of the Waldo Patent. When Henry Knox bequeathed it to his orphaned grandchildren, it became known as Orphan Island. In 1839 it became the plantation of Wetmore Isle. The name was changed to Verona (after Verona, Italy) upon its incorporation as a town on February 18, 1861. The town lengthened its name to Verona Island, matching the name of the landform on which it was located, in a March 27, 2004 referendum.

The island was once a shipbuilding village. In 1905 the last vessel was built. This was the &quot;Roosevelt&quot;, which carried Robert Peary from New York to the Arctic in 1908 for his final expedition to the North Pole.

The Waldo–Hancock Bridge (carrying U.S. 1), which opened November 16, 1931, to connect Verona Island and Prospect in Waldo County, is on the National Register of Historic Places but was in such bad condition that it was replaced. Demolition of the bridge began on November 20, 2012.

The new bridge, opened on December 30, 2006, is called the Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory. The legislature&#x27;s Transportation Committee originally decided it would be named the Downeast Gateway Bridge, but strong opposition by community leaders from eastern Waldo County forced this decision to be reconsidered. The new name was unanimously approved on March 9, 2006, by the committee.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The highest point is McCloud Mountain, at an elevation of above sea level.

The summer colony of Grindstone Neck lies on a peninsula southwest of the village.

Residents of this community share in an association which includes a yacht club, nine-hole golf course, tennis courts and footpaths.

The Winter Harbor Yacht Club purchased and renovated all nine original Winter Harbor 21 sailboats. Designed and launched in 1907, they are thought to be the oldest one-design sailboat fleet in the United States.

Many of the buildings on the neck were designed by Lindley Johnson, though the first few were designed by Wilson Eyre. The homes on Grindstone Neck are called &quot;cottages&quot;, though many of them have upwards of 7–12 bedrooms.

<text>Belgrade is a town in Kennebec County, Maine, United States. Its population was 3,250 at the 2020 census. However, its population approximately doubles during the summer months as part-year residents return to seasonal camps on the shores of Great Pond, Long Pond and Messalonskee Lake. Belgrade includes the villages of North Belgrade, Belgrade Depot and Belgrade Lakes (or The Village). It is included in the Augusta, Maine micropolitan New England City and Town Area.

==History==
The land was originally owned by the Plymouth Company, from which inhabitants obtained their titles. Called Washington Plantation, it was first settled in 1774 by Philip Snow from New Hampshire. On February 3, 1796, it was incorporated as Belgrade, named after Belgrade, Serbia. The surface of the town is uneven, much of it covered by water in the form of a connected chain of lakes. The largest lake is Great Pond, which dominates the town. Agriculture became the chief occupation of the inhabitants, with potatoes the principal crop.

Outlets of the ponds provided water power for mills. In 1859, there was a shovel factory and spool factory, as well as several sawmills and gristmills. By 1886, there were also factories that made rakes, shingles, excelsior, scythes and boxes. With the arrival of the railroad, Belgrade developed into a tourist resort of fishing, boating and lakeside cottages. The Belgrade Hotel, designed by noted Portland architect John Calvin Stevens, was built at Belgrade Lakes. The town was an annual summertime destination for the writers E.B. White and Ernest Thompson. The latter&#x27;s sojourns at Great Pond inspired his 1979 play &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, which was made into the Academy Award-winning 1981 movie, &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;. Belgrade Lake is central to the short story Once More to the Lake by E.B.White. In 1998, a semi-private golf course named Belgrade Lakes Golf Club was opened, which was named to the Golf Digest top 100 list for greatest public courses.

==Geography==

The town is crossed by 11, 27, 135 and 225. It borders the towns of Smithfield to the northeast, Oakland and Sidney to the east, Manchester and Readfield to the south, Mount Vernon to the southwest, and Rome to the northwest.

<text>China is a town in Kennebec County, Maine, United States. The population was 4,408 at the 2020 census. China is included in the Augusta, Maine micropolitan NECTA.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Bodies of water in the town include China Lake (3939 acres), Three Mile Pond (1174 acres), and Branch Pond (310 acres).

China is bordered on the northwest by Winslow, the northeast by Albion, on the east by Palermo, on the south by Windsor, and on the west by Vassalboro. It is served by U.S. Route 202, State Routes 32, 9 and 3.

===China Lake===
China Lake is a lake in the town. China Lake has two large basins connected by a narrow neck. The elongated eastern basin with an average depth of less than 30 feet (9.1 m) is entirely within the town of China, and has an irregular shoreline developed with residences and seasonal cottages.

===Climate===

This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, China has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

== History ==

In 1774, a family named Clark settled in the area and established Jones&#x27; Plantation. In 1796, Jones&#x27; Plantation was incorporated as Harlem. The area&#x27;s name was provided by Massachusetts legislative member Japheth Wasburn. On June 25, 1818, the Town of China was incorporated by combining Harlem, Fairfax (Albion), and Winslow.

The name of the town was chosen by Japheth Washburn. He wanted to call the town Bloomville, but people from the town of Bloomfield objected, saying that the similarity of names could cause confusion. Mr. Washburn settled on the name China, because it was the name of one of his favorite hymns. This widely sung hymn was written by Timothy Swan of Northfield, Massachusetts in 1790 and was published in Swan&#x27;s &quot;New England Harmony&quot; in 1801.
China had a fourth district located at the height of land between Palermo and Albion, part of which is located today in what is known as Thurston Park. It was in this area that numerous families of African-American descent settled. Their history, spanning roughly 1790 to 1860, can be itemized in the Maine state archives. Some cemetery plots can still be located with a guide, including a large obelisk stone in memory of &quot;Tolbot&quot; on a high wooded ridge which was also the location of an early shingle mill. Other burial and foundation sites are also present and can best be located by using early census maps and their indicators.

It is theorized that these families migrated here because it represented a safe area which slave catchers would not approach as China and several other towns were &quot;Quaker&quot; towns which would not tolerate slave catchers, no matter what either federal Fugitive Slave Act demanded.

== Localities ==

The town of China contains five villages: China Village, South China, China, Weeks Mills, and Branch Mills.

== Government ==

At a yearly town meeting citizens elect five Town Selectmen, one of whom is chosen as chairman. The citizens also outline the budget for the coming year. The Selectmen appoint a Town Manager who oversees the daily operation of the town.

== Education ==

China is part of Regional School Unit 18 (China, Rome, Belgrade, Sidney and Oakland). China students are given the choice of attending any public high school including nearby schools in Winslow, Waterville, Augusta and Oakland. There is also a private high school, Erskine Academy, in South China.

<text>Gardiner is a city in Kennebec County, Maine, United States. The population was 5,961 at the 2020 census. Popular with tourists, Gardiner is noted for its culture and old architecture. Gardiner is a nationally accredited Main Street America community. It is included in the Augusta, Maine micropolitan New England City and Town Area.

==History==

Located at the head of navigation on the Kennebec River, Gardiner was founded as Gardinerstown Plantation in 1754 by Dr. Silvester Gardiner, a prominent Boston physician. Dr. Gardiner had made a fortune as a drug merchant, with one apothecary shop in Massachusetts and two in Connecticut, and became a principal proprietor of the Kennebec Purchase within the old Plymouth Patent. He proved a tireless promoter for his development, which once comprised over .

Dr. Gardiner induced a gristmill builder, saw millwright, house carpenter and wheelwright to settle here, as well as a man he enslaved named Isaac &quot;Hazard&quot; Stockbridge. Houses, mills, a church and a blockhouse were built. Situated at the confluence of the Kennebec River and Cobbosseecontee Stream, which has falls that drop 130 feet, the location was recognized by him as ideal for water-powered mills. Gardinerstown, set off from Pittston in 1760, became center of the regional economy.

The wilderness toils of Dr. Gardiner would end, however, with the Revolution. Loyal to the Crown, he fled Boston in 1776 when the British army evacuated. But his settlement lived on without him, and in 1803 was incorporated as the town of Gardiner. From the early 19th century until the Civil War, shipbuilding and trade were primary industries. It would become a city in 1849, at which time ten large riverfront wharves served shipping. Lumber, in vast quantities, passed 
through Gardiner. Tanneries and shoe factories prospered.

The city became known for exporting ice. Each winter men cut large blocks from the Kennebec River, then covered the ice with sawdust in warehouses to keep it frozen into summer. It was loaded year-round on large vessels for shipment throughout the United States and world. Gardiner was noted for its pristine Kennebec ice, harvested at the furthest point upriver that deep-draft vessels could reach.

In 1851, the city was connected by railroad. One of the first workable steam automobiles in America was built in Gardiner in 1858. Beginning in the 1860s, paper mills flourished, as did the commercial ice industry between the 1880s and 1920s. By the 1960s, however, many mills declined and closed, sending Gardiner&#x27;s economy plummeting. The former mill town is now largely a bedroom community for people who work in Augusta, the state&#x27;s capital, as well as Bath Iron Works in Bath. Some residents commute as far as the Portland area. The city is endowed with a great deal of antique architecture, much of it beautifully restored. In 1980, the entire downtown historic district became one of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Kennebec County, Maine.

<text>Hallowell ( ) is a city in Kennebec County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,570 at the 2020 census. Popular with tourists, Hallowell is noted for its culture and old architecture. Hallowell is included in the Augusta, Maine, micropolitan New England City and Town Area.

==History==

The city is named for Benjamin Hallowell, a Boston merchant and one of the Kennebec Proprietors, holders of land originally granted to the Plymouth Company by the British monarchy in the 1620s.

The first settler of European descent was Deacon Pease Clark, who emigrated with his wife and son Peter from Attleborough, Massachusetts, in the spring of 1762. Legend has it that after disembarking on the west side of the Kennebec, near present-day Water Street, the Clarks took shelter in their overturned cart. On a riverfront lot measuring 50 rods (275 yards, about 250 meters), the Clark family raised corn, rye and other crops. The first land they cleared was occupied by the fire department in 1859.

In 1797, Harrington (later the city of Augusta) split from Hallowell to be a separate town. The part of Hallowell that is the current city was then known as &quot;The Hook&quot;. Today, the city&#x27;s population (2,467) is only slightly smaller than it was in 1820, the year Maine was separated from Massachusetts and became a state. Around 1830, Hallowell&#x27;s inhabitants enjoyed the services of 71 stores along Water Street (a greater number than Augusta, which had a population of 1,000 and just 20 merchants). 

Thriving industries included logging, trading, publishing and shipbuilding. Location on the navigable Kennebec River estuary allowed 50 ships launched from Hallowell&#x27;s wharves to reach the Atlantic Ocean between 1783 and 1901. Two grist mills, five sawmills and two slaughterhouses served the needs of residents near and far.

In 1815, the first granite quarried near the Manchester town line signaled the birth of an industry that would support Hallowell until 1908, when cement displaced stone as the construction material of choice. In 1826, the ice industry began in earnest, employing thousands over the next 75 years. Frozen blocks loaded onto Hallowell&#x27;s schooners were delivered to Cuba and the West Indies. Other local products exported via the Kennebec (and, after 1857, by train) from Hallowell included sandpaper, textiles from cotton from the Deep South, rope, linseed oil, oilcloth, wire, books and shoes.
The Kennebec River sustained the city from its inception, but the waterway also inspired fear. Spring floods regularly terrorized shopkeepers and sometimes brought commerce to a standstill. Worse still, citizens eager to cross the river in winter and unwary children skating and playing too far from the riverbank lost their lives when ice turned out to be thinner than it looked. During 1816, the Year Without a Summer, numerous crops were damaged and/or destroyed throughout New England, including in Hallowell. Farmers were often forced to slaughter some of their livestock for food and, later, to sell remaining crops at nearly double normal prices.

In 1875, the state opened the Maine Industrial School for Girls in Hallowell. Operated until the 1970s, it was the state&#x27;s first reform school for girls.

==History==
Vassalboro was first settled by colonists in 1760 and incorporated in 1771. It was named for one of the settlement&#x27;s proprietors, William Vassall.

===William Vassall===
William Vassall was born in 1715 on his family&#x27;s Jamaican sugar plantation.
Slavery had formed an &quot;integral part&quot; of the Vassalls&#x27; fortune since 1648, when William&#x27;s great-grandfather moved to Barbados and launched the family into the sugar business.
As a boy, Vassall moved first to Philadelphia, then Boston. He earned a BA (1733) and an MA (1743) from Harvard. A Loyalist during the Revolution, he fled to England, where he died in 1800, having spent many years arguing for &quot;compensation for what he deemed the illegal confiscation of his properties in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.&quot;
On 2 March 1770, Vassall conveyed to his niece Mary Prescott of Nova Scotia Lot Number 5 in Vassalboro, one of the so-called &quot;Proprietor&#x27;s Lots&quot; reserved for the town&#x27;s founders. Niece Prescott sold the lot nine months later to a citizen of Hallowell.

<text>Waterville is a city in Kennebec County, Maine, United States, on the west bank of the Kennebec River. A college town, the city is home to Colby College, a NESCAC college, and Thomas College.

As of the 2020 census the population was 15,828. Along with Augusta, Waterville is one of the principal cities of the Augusta-Waterville, ME Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The area now known as Waterville was once inhabited by the Canibas tribe of the Abenaki people. Called &quot;Taconnet&quot; after Chief Taconnet, the main village was located on the east bank of the Kennebec River at its confluence with the Sebasticook River at what is now Winslow. Known as &quot;Ticonic&quot; by English settlers, it was burned in 1692 during King William&#x27;s War, after which the Canibas tribe abandoned the area. Fort Halifax was built by General John Winslow in 1754, and the last skirmish with indigenous peoples occurred on May 18, 1757.

The township would be organized as Kingfield Plantation, then incorporated as Winslow in 1771. When residents on the west side of the Kennebec found themselves unable to cross the river to attend town meetings, Waterville was founded from the western parts of Winslow and incorporated on June 23, 1802. In 1824 a bridge was built joining the communities. Early industries included fishing, lumbering, agriculture and ship building, with larger boats launched in spring during freshets. By the early 1900s, there were five shipyards in the community.

Ticonic Falls blocked navigation farther upriver, so Waterville developed as the terminus for trade and shipping. The Kennebec River and Messalonskee Stream provided water power for mills, including several sawmills, a gristmill, a sash and blind factory, a furniture factory, and a shovel handle factory. There was also a carriage and sleigh factory, boot shop, brickyard, and tannery. On September 27, 1849, the Androscoggin and Kennebec Railroad opened to Waterville. It would become part of the Maine Central Railroad, which in 1870 established locomotive and car repair shops in the thriving mill town. West Waterville (renamed Oakland) was set off as a town in 1873. Waterville was incorporated as a city on January 12, 1888.

The Ticonic Water Power &amp; Manufacturing Company was formed in 1866 and soon built a dam across the Kennebec. After a change of ownership in 1873, the company began construction on what would become the Lockwood Manufacturing Company, a cotton textile plant. A second mill was added, and by 1900 the firm dominated the riverfront and employed 1,300 workers. Lockwood Mills survived until the mid-1950s. The iron Waterville-Winslow Footbridge opened in 1901, as a means for Waterville residents to commute to Winslow for work in the Hollingsworth &amp; Whitney Co. and Wyandotte Worsted Co. mills, but in less than a year was carried away by the highest river level since 1832. Rebuilt in 1903, it would be called the Two Cent Bridge because of its toll. In 1902, the Beaux-Arts style City Hall and Opera House designed by George Gilman Adams was dedicated. In 2002, the C.F. Hathaway Company, one of the last remaining factories in the United States producing high-end dress shirts, was purchased by Warren Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway company and was closed after over 160 years of operation in the city.

Waterville also developed as an educational center. In 1813, the Maine Literary and Theological Institution was established. It would be renamed Waterville College in 1821, then Colby College in 1867. Thomas College was established in 1894. The Latin School was founded in 1820 to prepare students to attend Colby and other colleges, and was subsequently named Waterville Academy, Waterville Classical Institute, and Coburn Classical Institute; the Institute merged with the Oak Grove School in Vassalboro in 1970, and remained open until 1989. The first public high school was built in 1877, while the current Waterville Senior High School was built in 1961.

==Economy and redevelopment==

Like many other towns in Maine and in the United States, Waterville has seen development in the suburbs and the decline of the downtown area. There have been new businesses and new facilities built by Inland Hospital on Kennedy Memorial Drive. Walmart, Home Depot, and a small strip mall of other stores have been built in the northern part of the city as part of an open-air shopping center. Because of this growth, the existing and now-neighboring Elm Plaza shopping center has recently had its exterior renovated and filled most or all of its previous vacancies.

In contrast, the downtown area has had its share of hardships due to chain store growth in the city. Stores that had a long history in the downtown area have closed in recent decades, including Levine&#x27;s, Butlers, Sterns, Dunhams, Alvina and Delias, and LaVerdieres. The large vacancy in The Concourse shopping center that once housed the Ames, Zayre department store, as well as Brooks Pharmacy is struggling to find tenants; as is the now vacant Main Street location of a CVS pharmacy (it moved to a brand new building on Kennedy Memorial Drive). Organizations like Waterville Main St continue their efforts to revitalize downtown. Colby College has built a new dormitory for students on Main Street, and the boutique Lockwood Hotel opened in August 2022. The Paul J. Schupf Art Center is currently under construction.

Developer Paul Boghossian has converted the old Hathaway Mill to retail, office, and residential use. MaineGeneral Health agreed at the end of June 2007 to become the first tenant.

Waterville&#x27;s top employers include MaineGeneral Medical Center, Colby College, HealthReach Community Health Centers, Northern Light Inland Hospital, Hannaford Supermarket, Shaw&#x27;s Supermarket, Wal-Mart, Mount St. Joseph Nursing Home, Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, Thomas College, City of Waterville, The Woodlands Residential Care, and Central Maine Newspapers.

==Government==

===Local government===
Waterville has a mayor and council-manager form of government, led by a mayor and a seven-member city council. The city council is the governing board, and the city manager is the chief administrative officer of the city, responsible for the management of all city affairs.

Waterville adopted a city charter in the 1970s. For some 40 years, the city had a &quot;strong mayor&quot; system in which the mayor enjoyed broad executive powers, including the power to veto measures passed by the city council and to line-item veto budget items passed by the council. In 2005, the charter was substantially revised, changing the city government to a &quot;weak mayor&quot; council-manager system. Under the present system, the city manager is the chief executive. The charter revision was approved by city voters by a 4–1 margin. The city is currently divided into seven geographic wards, each of which elects one member of the Waterville City Council and one member of the Waterville School Board.

Since 1970, the following people have served as mayor of Waterville: Richard &quot;Spike&quot; Carey (1970–1978), Paul Laverdiere (Republican, 1978–1982); Ann Gilbride Hill (Democrat, 1982–1986); Thomas Nale (1986–1987); Judy C. Kany (Democrat, 1988–1989); David E. Bernier (1990–1993); Thomas J. Brazier (1994–1995); Nelson Megna (1995–1996); Ruth Joseph (Democrat, 1996–1998); Nelson Madore (Democrat, 1999–2004); Paul R. LePage (Republican, 2004–2011); Dana W. Sennett (Democrat, 2011); Karen Heck (independent, 2012–2014); Nicholas Isgro (Republican, 2015–2020); Jay Coelho (2021–present).

In 2018, Isgro faced a recall election after he made a Twitter post insulting a gun control activist present during the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The recall effort was backed by former Mayor Karen Heck, a Democrat who had previously endorsed Isgro. Isgro later made his Twitter feed private and said that he had deleted the post. During the recall effort, Isgro asserted that outside interests and the City Council were plotting to oust him over disputes over the city budget and taxation. After an acrimonious recall campaign, Waterville voters defeated the recall attempt, with 1,563 &quot;no&quot; votes (51%) to 1,472 &quot;yes&quot; votes (49%).

===Political makeup===
Waterville is considered a Democratic stronghold in Maine&#x27;s 1st congressional district. Barack Obama received 70% of Waterville&#x27;s votes in the 2008 presidential election.

<text>Cushing is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,502 at the 2020 census. A favorite of artists for its unspoiled natural setting, Cushing includes the villages of North Cushing, Cushing, South Cushing, and Pleasant Point.

==History==
Part of the Waldo Patent, it was called the Lower Plantation of St. Georges, once extending across both sides of the St. George River. It was first permanently settled in 1733 with Scots and Irish immigrants recruited from Ireland by Brigadier-General Samuel Waldo, who offered for each household. Attacks during the French and Indian Wars, however, deterred habitation. A stone blockhouse known as Burton&#x27;s Fort was built in 1753 by its commander, Captain Benjamin Burton. Hostilities finally ceased in 1759 with the Fall of Quebec. On January 28, 1789, the town was incorporated and named for Thomas Cushing, statesman and lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. On February 7, 1803, the town of St. George was set off and incorporated.

The Olson House was depicted in Andrew Wyeth&#x27;s 1948 painting, &quot;Christina&#x27;s World,&quot; which in turn was used as Dahlia Gillespie&#x27;s house in the horror video game series &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, and inspired the farmer&#x27;s house in the 1978 film &quot;Days of Heaven&quot;. The building is now operated by the Farnsworth Art Museum of Rockland.

<text>Friendship (formerly known as Meduncook) is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States. It is 31 miles (49.9 km) southeast of Augusta. The population was 1,142 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Abenaki Native Americans called it Meduncook, meaning &quot;bay at the end of the sandbar&quot;. Part of the Waldo Patent, it was first settled in 1750. A garrison was built on Garrison Island, which is connected to the mainland at low tide. By 1754, 22 families lived in Meduncook, most taking shelter within the garrison when the French and Indian War broke out.

=== Raid on Meduncook (1758) ===
During the French and Indian War, the community was raided twice. The first attack was from the Abenaki just after sunrise on May 22, 1758. They killed and scalped Joshua and Hannah Bradford and their infant son, Winslow. An original settler from Kingston, Massachusetts, and a great-grandson of Governor William Bradford, Joshua had remained in his house, believing it close enough to the garrison that his family could flee there when necessary, but, while pounding corn, the Bradfords missed hearing the garrison&#x27;s alarm gun. Five of their children managed to escape their pursuers into the fort, but two of their sons Cornelius (21) and Joshua (12) were captured and carried to Canada.

After trying to lay siege to Thomaston, Maine, in September 1758, a party of Native Americans and Acadians under the command of the French officer Boishebert, raided the village. Eight British were captured or killed.

On February 25, 1807, Meduncook Plantation was incorporated as Friendship. By 1859, when the population was 691, the village had two shipbuilders, two gristmills, one shingle mill and three sawmills. By 1880, when the population was 938, other manufactures included sails, carriages, boots and shoes. Boatbuilding remained the dominant industry in town, which became famous for producing the Friendship Sloop, a gaff-rigged sailboat designed for lobstering and fishing. Each summer the town hosts the Friendship Sloop Races.

The author John Cheever wrote his 1957 novel, &quot;The Wapshot Chronicle&quot;, while vacationing here.

<doc id="116035" wikidata="Q266210" url="?curid=116035" title="Tetraethyllead">
<text>Tetraethyllead (commonly styled tetraethyl lead), abbreviated TEL, is an organolead compound with the formula Pb(C2H5)4. It was widely used as a fuel additive for much of the 20th century, first being mixed with gasoline beginning in the 1920s. This &quot;leaded gasoline&quot; had an increased octane rating that allowed engine compression to be raised substantially and in turn increased vehicle performance and fuel economy. TEL was first synthesised by German chemist Carl Jacob Löwig in 1853. American chemical engineer Thomas Midgley Jr., who was working for the U.S. corporation General Motors, was the first to discover its effectiveness as an antiknock agent in 1921, after spending several years attempting to find an additive that was both highly effective and inexpensive.

In the mid-20th century, scientists discovered TEL caused lead poisoning and was toxic to the human brain, especially in children. The United States and many other countries began phasing out the use of TEL in automotive fuel in the 1970s. By the early 2000s, most countries had completely banned the use of TEL in gasoline. Since 2011, leaded gasoline has been banned in every country. A 2011 study backed by the United Nations estimated that the removal of TEL had resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, and 1.2 million fewer premature deaths.

Despite being banned from use in automotive fuel, TEL is sometimes still used in certain grades of aviation fuel. Innospec has claimed to be the last firm legally making TEL but, , TEL was being produced illegally by several companies in China. In July 2021, the sale of leaded gasoline for cars was completely phased out worldwide, prompting the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to declare an &quot;official end&quot; of its use in cars on August 30, 2021.

== Synthesis and properties ==
TEL is produced by reacting chloroethane with a sodium–lead alloy.

The product is recovered by steam distillation, leaving a sludge of lead and sodium chloride. TEL is a viscous colorless liquid with a sweet odor. Because TEL is charge neutral and contains an exterior of alkyl groups, it is highly lipophilic and soluble in petrol (gasoline). This property, which allows it to dissolve so evenly and effectively in motor fuel, also allows it to dissolve oils and fats well, and therefore, diffuse through the blood–brain barrier and accumulate within the limbic forebrain, frontal cortex, and hippocampus.

Despite decades of research, no reactions were found to improve upon this process, which is rather difficult, involves metallic sodium, and converts only 25% of the lead to TEL. A related compound, tetramethyllead, was commercially produced by a different electrolytic reaction. A process with lithium was developed but never put into practice.

== Reactions ==
A noteworthy feature of TEL is the weakness of its four C–Pb bonds. At the temperatures found in internal combustion engines, TEL decomposes completely into lead as well as combustible, short-lived ethyl radicals. Lead and lead oxide scavenge radical intermediates in combustion reactions. Engine knock is caused by a cool flame, an oscillating low-temperature combustion reaction that occurs before the proper, hot ignition. Lead quenches the pyrolysed radicals and thus kills the radical chain reaction that would sustain a cool flame, preventing it from disturbing the smooth ignition of the hot flame front. Lead itself is the reactive antiknock agent, and the ethyl groups serve as a gasoline-soluble carrier.

When TEL burns, it produces not only carbon dioxide and water, but also lead and lead(II) oxide:


Pb and PbO would quickly over-accumulate and foul an engine. For this reason, 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane were also added to gasoline as lead scavengers—these agents form volatile lead(II) chloride and lead(II) bromide, respectively, which flush the lead from the engine and into the air:


== In motor fuel ==
TEL was extensively used as a gasoline additive beginning in the 1920s, wherein it served as an effective antiknock agent and reduced exhaust valve and valve seat wear. Concerns were raised in reputable journals of likely health outcomes of fine particles of lead in the atmosphere as early as 1924. 

=== Valve wear preventive ===
Tetraethyllead helps cool intake valves and is an excellent buffer against microwelds forming between exhaust valves and their seats. Once these valves reopen, the microwelds pull apart and abrade the valves and seats, leading to valve recession. When TEL began to be phased out, the automotive industry began specifying hardened valve seats and upgraded materials which allow for high wear resistance without requiring lead.

=== Antiknock agent ===
A gasoline-fuelled reciprocating engine requires fuel of sufficient octane rating to prevent uncontrolled combustion (preignition and detonation). Antiknock agents allow the use of higher compression ratios for greater efficiency and peak power. Adding varying amounts of additives to gasoline allowed easy, inexpensive control of octane ratings. TEL offered the business advantage of being commercially profitable because its use for this purpose could be patented. Aviation fuels with TEL used in WWII reached octane ratings of 150 to enable turbocharged and supercharged engines such as the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Griffon to reach high horsepower ratings at altitude. In military aviation, TEL manipulation allowed a range of different fuels to be tailored for particular flight conditions.

In 1935 a licence to produce TEL was given to IG Farben, enabling the newly formed German to use high-octane gasoline. A company, Ethyl GmbH, was formed that produced TEL at two sites in Germany with a government contract from 10 June 1936.

In 1938 the United Kingdom Air Ministry contracted with ICI for the construction and operation of a TEL plant. A site was chosen at Holford Moss, near Plumley in Cheshire. Construction started in April 1939 and TEL was being produced by September 1940.

=== &quot;Ethyl Fluid&quot; ===

For mixing with raw gasoline, TEL was most commonly supplied in the form of &quot;Ethyl Fluid&quot;, which consisted of TEL blended with 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane, which prevent lead from building up in the engine. Ethyl Fluid also contained a reddish dye to distinguish treated from untreated gasoline and discourage the use of leaded gasoline for other purposes such as cleaning.

In the 1920s, before safety procedures were strengthened, 17 workers for the Ethyl Corporation, DuPont, and Standard Oil died from the effects of exposure to lead.

Ethyl Fluid&#x27;s formulation consisted of:
* 61.45% tetraethyllead
* 18.80% 1,2-dichloroethane
* 17.85% 1,2-dibromoethane
* 1.90% inerts and dyes

Dichloroethane and dibromoethane act in a synergistic manner, where equal or approximately equal quantities of both provide the best scavenging ability.

=== Phaseout and ban ===
In most industrialized countries, a phaseout of TEL from road vehicle fuels was completed by the early 2000s because of concerns over air and soil lead levels and the accumulative neurotoxicity of lead. In the European Union, tetraethyllead has been classified as a Substance of Very High Concern and placed on the Candidate List for Authorisation under Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). Potential use of TEL would need to be authorised through the REACH authorisation procedure. While not a complete ban, it introduces significant obligations such as a mandatory analysis of alternatives and socioeconomic analysis.

The use of catalytic converters, mandated in the United States for 1975 and later model-year cars to meet tighter emissions regulations, started a gradual phase-out of leaded gasoline in the U.S. The need for TEL was lessened by several advances in automotive engineering and petroleum chemistry. Safer methods for making higher-octane blending stocks such as reformate and iso-octane reduced the need to rely on TEL, as did other antiknock additives of varying toxicity including metallic compounds such as methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) as well as oxygenates including methyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether (MTBE), &quot;tert&quot;-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and ethyl &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether (ETBE).

The first country to completely ban leaded gasoline was Japan in 1986.

Since January 1993 all gasoline powered cars sold in the European Union and the United Kingdom have been required to use unleaded fuel. This was to comply with the Euro 1 emission standards which mandated that all new cars to be fitted with a catalytic converter. Unleaded fuel was first introduced in the United Kingdom in June 1986.

Leaded gasoline was removed from the forecourts in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2000, and a Lead Replacement Petrol was introduced although this was largely withdrawn by 2003 due to dwindling sales. An exemption to the ban exists for owners of classic cars.

Vehicles designed and built to run on leaded fuel often require modification to run on unleaded gasoline. These modifications fall into two categories: those required for physical compatibility with unleaded fuel, and those performed to compensate for the relatively low octane of early unleaded fuels. Physical compatibility requires the installation of hardened exhaust valves and seats. Compatibility with reduced octane was addressed by reducing compression, generally by installing thicker cylinder head gaskets and/or rebuilding the engine with compression-reducing pistons, although modern high-octane unleaded gasoline has eliminated the need to decrease compression ratios.

Leaded gasoline remained legal as of late 2014 in parts of Algeria, Iraq, Yemen, Myanmar, North Korea, and Afghanistan. North Korea and Myanmar purchased their TEL from China, while Algeria, Iraq, and Yemen purchased it from the specialty chemical company Innospec, the world&#x27;s sole remaining legal manufacturer of TEL. In 2011 several Innospec executives were charged and imprisoned for bribing various government state-owned oil companies to approve the sale of their TEL products.

 the UNEP-sponsored phase-out was nearly complete: only Algeria, Iraq, and Yemen continued widespread use of leaded gasoline, although not exclusively. In July 2021, Algeria had halted its sale.

*Leaded petrol was supposed to be completely phased out continent-wide on 1 January 2006, following a ban initiated from the 2002 Earth Summit. However, in Algeria refineries needed to be altered; as a result, leaded fuel remained available in parts of Algeria, with phaseout scheduled for 2016. After the Algerian Government outlawed the sale of leaded petrol throughout all of Algeria, leaded petrol has now been effectively phased out.

==== In motor racing ====
Leaded fuel was commonly used in professional motor racing, until its phase out beginning in the 1990s. Since 1992, Formula One racing cars have been required to use fuel containing no more than 5 mg/L of lead.

NASCAR began experimentation in 1998 with an unleaded fuel, and in 2006 began switching the national series to unleaded fuel, completing the transition at the Fontana round in February 2007 when the premier class switched. This was influenced after blood tests of NASCAR teams revealed elevated blood lead levels.

==== Aviation gasoline ====

TEL remains an ingredient of 100 octane avgas for piston-engine aircraft. The current formulation of 100LL (low lead, blue) aviation gasoline contains of TEL, half the amount of the previous 100/130 (green) octane avgas (at 4.24 grams per gallon), and twice as much as the 1 gram per gallon permitted in regular automotive leaded gasoline prior to 1988 and substantially greater than the allowed 0.001 grams per gallon in automotive unleaded gasoline sold in the United States today. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, FAA, and others are working on economically feasible replacements for leaded avgas, which still releases 100 tons of lead every year.

==== Alternative antiknock agents ====
Antiknock agents are classed as &quot;high-percentage&quot; additives, such as alcohol, and &quot;low-percentage&quot; additives based on heavy elements. Since the main problem with TEL is its lead content, many alternative additives that contain less poisonous metals have been examined. A manganese-carrying additive, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT or methylcymantrene), was used for a time as an antiknock agent, though its safety is controversial and it has been the subject of bans and lawsuits. Ferrocene, an organometallic compound of iron, is also used as an antiknock agent although with some significant drawbacks.

High-percentage additives are organic compounds that do not contain metals, but require much higher blending ratios, such as 20–30% for benzene and ethanol. It had been established by 1921 that ethanol was an effective antiknock agent, but TEL was introduced instead mainly for commercial reasons. Oxygenates such as TAME derived from natural gas, MTBE made from methanol, and ethanol-derived ETBE, have largely supplanted TEL. MTBE has environmental risks of its own and there are also bans on its use.

Improvements to gasoline itself decrease the need for antiknock additives. Synthetic iso-octane and alkylate are examples of such blending stocks. Benzene and other high-octane aromatics can be also blended to raise the octane number, but they are disfavored today because of toxicity and carcinogenicity.

== Toxicity ==
6 mL of tetraethyllead is enough to induce severe lead poisoning. The hazards of TEL content are heightened due to the compound&#x27;s volatility and high lipophilicity, enabling it to easily cross the blood–brain barrier.

Early symptoms of acute exposure to tetraethyllead can manifest as irritation of the eyes and skin, sneezing, fever, vomiting, and a metallic taste in the mouth. Later symptoms of acute TEL poisoning include pulmonary edema, anemia, ataxia, convulsions, severe weight loss, delirium, irritability, hallucinations, nightmares, fever, muscle and joint pain, swelling of the brain, coma, and damage to cardiovascular and renal organs.
Chronic exposure to TEL can cause long-term negative effects such as memory loss, delayed reflexes, neurological problems, insomnia, tremors, psychosis, loss of attention, and an overall decrease in IQ and cognitive function.

The carcinogenity of tetraethyllead is debatable. It is believed to harm the male reproductive system and cause birth defects.

Concerns over the toxicity of lead eventually led to the ban on TEL in automobile gasoline in many countries. Some neurologists have speculated that the lead phaseout may have caused average IQ levels to rise by several points in the US (by reducing cumulative brain damage throughout the population, especially in the young). For the entire US population, during and after the TEL phaseout, the mean blood lead level dropped from 16 μg/dL in 1976 to only 3 μg/dL in 1991. The U.S. Centers of Disease control previously labelled children with 10 μg/dL or more as having a &quot;blood lead level of concern&quot;. In 2021, the level was lowered in accordance with the average lead level in the U.S. decreasing to 3.5 μg/dL or more as having a &quot;blood lead level of concern&quot;.

== History ==
In 1853, German chemist Karl Jacob Löwig (1803–1890) first prepared what he claimed was Pb2(C2H5)3 from ethyl iodide and an alloy of lead and sodium. In 1859, English chemist George Bowdler Buckton (1818–1905) reported what he claimed was Pb(C2H5)2 from zinc ethyl (Zn(C2H5)2) and lead(II) chloride. Later authors credit both methods of preparation with producing tetraethyl lead.

=== In fuel ===
TEL remained unimportant commercially until the 1920s. In 1921, at the direction of DuPont Corporation, which manufactured TEL, it was found to be an effective antiknock agent by Thomas Midgley, working under Charles Kettering at General Motors Corporation Research. General Motors patented the use of TEL as an antiknock agent and used the name &quot;Ethyl&quot; that had been proposed by Kettering in its marketing materials, thereby avoiding the negative connotation of the word &quot;lead&quot;. Early research into &quot;engine knocking&quot; (also called &quot;pinging&quot; or &quot;pinking&quot;) was also led by A.H. Gibson and Harry Ricardo in England and Thomas Boyd in the United States. The discovery that lead additives modified this behavior led to the widespread adoption of their use in the 1920s, and therefore more powerful, higher-compression engines. In 1924, Standard Oil of New Jersey (ESSO/EXXON) and General Motors created the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation to produce and market TEL. Deepwater, New Jersey, across the river from Wilmington, was the site for production of some of DuPont&#x27;s most important chemicals, particularly TEL. After TEL production at the Bayway Refinery was shut down, Deepwater was the only plant in the Western hemisphere producing TEL up to 1948, when it accounted for the bulk of the Dupont/Deepwater&#x27;s production.

=== Initial controversy ===
The toxicity of concentrated TEL was recognized early on, as lead had been recognized since the 19th century as a dangerous substance that could cause lead poisoning. In 1924, a public controversy arose over the &quot;loony gas&quot;, after five workers died, and many others were severely injured, in Standard Oil refineries in New Jersey. There had also been a private controversy for two years prior to this controversy; several public health experts, including Alice Hamilton and Yandell Henderson, engaged Midgley and Kettering with letters warning of the dangers to public health. After the death of the workers, dozens of newspapers reported on the issue. &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorialized in 1924 that the deaths should not interfere with the production of more powerful fuel.

To settle the issue, the U.S. Public Health Service conducted a conference in 1925, and the sales of TEL were voluntarily suspended for one year to conduct a hazard assessment. The conference was initially expected to last for several days, but reportedly the conference decided that evaluating presentations on alternative anti-knock agents was not &quot;its province&quot;, so it lasted a single day. Kettering and Midgley stated that no alternatives for anti-knocking were available, although private memos showed discussion of such agents. One commonly discussed agent was ethanol. The Public Health Service created a committee that reviewed a government-sponsored study of workers and an Ethyl lab test, and concluded that while leaded gasoline should not be banned, it should continue to be investigated. The low concentrations present in gasoline and exhaust were not perceived as immediately dangerous. A U.S. Surgeon General committee issued a report in 1926 that concluded there was no real evidence that the sale of TEL was hazardous to human health but urged further study. In the years that followed, research was heavily funded by the lead industry; in 1943, Randolph Byers found children with lead poisoning had behavior problems, but the Lead Industries Association threatened him with a lawsuit and the research ended.

In the late 1920s, Robert A. Kehoe of the University of Cincinnati was the Ethyl Corporation&#x27;s chief medical consultant and one of the lead industry&#x27;s staunchest advocates, who would not be discredited until decades later by Dr. Clair Patterson&#x27;s work on human lead burdens (see below) and other studies. In 1928, Dr. Kehoe expressed the opinion that there was no basis for concluding that leaded fuels posed any health threat. He convinced the Surgeon General that the dose–response relationship of lead had &quot;no effect&quot; below a certain threshold. As the head of Kettering Laboratories for many years, Kehoe would become a chief promoter of the safety of TEL, an influence that did not begin to wane until about the early 1960s. But by the 1970s, the general opinion of the safety of TEL would change, and by 1976 the U.S. government would begin to require the phaseout of this product.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Clair Cameron Patterson accidentally discovered the pollution caused by TEL in the environment while determining the age of the Earth. As he attempted to measure lead content of very old rocks, and the time it took uranium to decay into lead, the readings were made inaccurate by lead in the environment that contaminated his samples. He was then forced to work in a cleanroom to keep his samples uncontaminated by environmental pollution of lead. After coming up with a fairly accurate estimate of the age of the Earth, he turned to investigating the lead contamination problem by examining ice cores from countries such as Greenland. He realized that the lead contamination in the environment dated from about the time that TEL became widely used as a fuel additive in gasoline. Being aware of the health dangers posed by lead and suspicious of the pollution caused by TEL, he became one of the earliest and most effective proponents of removing it from use.

In the 1960s, the first clinical works were published proving the toxicity of this compound in humans, e.g. by Mirosław Jan Stasik.

===Modern findings===
In the 1970s, Herbert Needleman found that higher lead levels in children were correlated with decreased school performance. Needleman was repeatedly accused of scientific misconduct by individuals within the lead industry, but he was eventually cleared by a scientific advisory council. Needleman also wrote the average US child&#x27;s blood lead level was 13.7 μg/dL in 1976 and that Patterson believed that everyone was to some degree poisoned by TEL in gasoline.

In the U.S. in 1973, the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations to reduce the lead content of leaded gasoline over a series of annual phases, which therefore came to be known as the &quot;lead phasedown&quot; program. EPA&#x27;s rules were issued under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, as amended 1970. The Ethyl Corp challenged the EPA regulations in Federal court. Although the EPA&#x27;s regulation was initially invalidated, the EPA won the case on appeal, so the TEL phasedown began to be implemented in 1976. Leaded gas was banned in vehicles with catalytic converters in 1975 due to damage of catalytic converters but it continued to be sold for vehicles without catalytic converters. Additional regulatory changes were made by EPA over the next decade (including adoption of a trading market in &quot;lead credits&quot; in 1982 that became the precursor of the Acid Rain Allowance Market, adopted in 1990 for SO2), but the decisive rule was issued in 1985. The EPA mandated that lead additive be reduced by 91 percent by the end of 1986. A 1994 study had indicated that the concentration of lead in the blood of the U.S. population had dropped 78% from 1976 to 1991. The U.S. phasedown regulations also were due in great part to studies conducted by Philip J. Landrigan.

In Europe, Professor Derek Bryce-Smith was among the first to highlight the potential dangers of TEL and became a leading campaigner for removal of lead additives from petrol. 

From 1 January 1996, the U.S. Clean Air Act banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles although that year the US EPA indicated that TEL could still be used in aircraft, racing cars, farm equipment, and marine engines. Thus, what had begun in the U.S. as a phasedown ultimately ended in a phase-out for on-road vehicle TEL. Similar bans in other countries have resulted in lowering levels of lead in people&#x27;s bloodstreams.

Taking cue from the domestic programs, the U.S. Agency for International Development undertook an initiative to reduce tetraethyl lead use in other countries, notably its efforts in Egypt begun in 1995. In 1996, with the cooperation of the U.S. AID, Egypt took almost all of the lead out of its gasoline. The success in Egypt provided a model for AID efforts worldwide.

By 2000, the TEL industry had moved the major portion of their sales to developing countries whose governments they lobbied against phasing out leaded gasoline. Leaded gasoline was withdrawn entirely from the European Union market on 1 January 2000, although it had been banned earlier in most member states. Other countries also phased out TEL. India banned leaded petrol in March 2000.

By 2011, the United Nations announced that it had been successful in phasing out leaded gasoline worldwide. &quot;Ridding the world of leaded petrol, with the United Nations leading the effort in developing countries, has resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, 1.2 million fewer premature deaths, higher overall intelligence and 58 million fewer crimes&quot;, the United Nations Environmental Programme said. The announcement was slightly premature, as a few countries still had leaded gasoline for sale as of 2017. On 30 August 2021 the United Nations Environment Programme announced that leaded gasoline had been eliminated. The final stocks of the product were used up in Algeria, which had continued to produce leaded gasoline until July 2021.

=== Effect on crime rates ===
Reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the United States. A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime: the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve with a 22-year time lag. After the ban on TEL, blood lead levels in U.S. children dramatically decreased. Researchers including Amherst College economist Jessica Wolpaw Reyes, Department of Housing and Urban Development consultant Rick Nevin, and Howard Mielke of Tulane University say that declining exposure to lead is responsible for an up to 56% decline in crime from 1992 to 2002. Taking into consideration other factors that are believed to have increased crime rates over that period, Reyes found that the reduced exposure to lead led to an actual decline of 34% over that period.

=== Lingering issues over time ===

Although leaded gasoline has long since ended its history of regular use in U.S. transportation, it has left high concentrations of lead in the soil adjacent to roads that were heavily used prior to its phaseout. These contaminated materials present health dangers even when merely touched or when components of it get breathed in. Children, especially those in poverty inside of the U.S., are particularly at risk.

<text>Isle au Haut () is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States, on an island of the same name in Penobscot Bay. The population was 92 at the 2020 census. Home to portions of Acadia National Park, Isle au Haut is accessible by ferry from Stonington. The 6 mile ride takes about 45 minutes.

==History==
Native Americans left behind shell mounds on the island following their oyster feasts. It was territory of the Penobscot Abenaki Indians when, in 1604, French explorer Samuel de Champlain named it Isle au Haut, meaning High Island. English Capt. John Smith, charting the coast in 1614, noted that it was the highest island in Penobscot Bay. It was included in Deer Isle Plantation, incorporated by Massachusetts on February 2, 1789, as the town of Deer Isle.

In 1792, Henry Barter was granted land on the island, which by 1800 had a population of about 50 English and Scottish settlers. They subsisted by raising sheep, farming and fishing. In 1808, the island was the scene of a murder when smugglers shot and killed a federal customs officer. In the mid-19th century, the chief occupations were fishing and boatbuilding. On February 28, 1874, Isle au Haut was set off from Deer Isle and incorporated as a town.

By the late 19th century, when the island&#x27;s population reached about 275, a village had developed beside the Isle au Haut Thoroughfare separating Kimball Island. The 1880s brought an influx of &quot;rusticators,&quot; seasonal inhabitants, often from Boston and other big cities, who built vacation cottages at a private club at Point Lookout. In 1910, Isle au Haut had 178 year-round residents and 15 summer families. Some fishermen left when motors replaced sails to power boats, allowing them to operate more conveniently from the mainland. By 1935, the population had dropped to 75.

Today, lobster fishing remains the main industry, while the portions of Acadia National Park which cover about 60% of the island attract a few tourists. Vacation houses, although far fewer than those of the nearby summer colonies of North Haven, Vinalhaven and Mount Desert Island, more than double Isle au Haut&#x27;s population during the summer. Linda Greenlaw wrote a book about it titled &quot;The Lobster Chronicles&quot; (2003).

Electricity came to the island in 1970, with telephone service in 1988.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Isle au Haut is an island approximately long by wide in Penobscot Bay, part of the Gulf of Maine and Atlantic Ocean.
Mount Champlain, elevation , is the highest point on the island, located on a north-south ridge occupying the island&#x27;s center. Rocky Mountain, elevation , and Sawyer Mountain, at , are neighboring summits along the ridge to the south. The terrain consists of low hills covered by temperate coniferous forests; the coastline is mainly granite boulders, with a few rocky beaches and salt marshes. Long Pond, a small freshwater lake, stretches down the eastern side of the island; being warmer and more sheltered than the surrounding ocean, it is used for recreation and one may occasionally see a float plane, although no scheduled service is available.

<text>Matinicus Isle is an island plantation in Knox County, Maine, United States. The island is located within Penobscot Bay about 20 miles east of the mainland coast and is accessible by state ferry service from Rockland or by air taxi from Knox County Regional Airport. Matinicus is the inhabited land furthest off the American East Coast. The plantation is both a year-round island community and a summer colony. The population was 53 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Matinicus is an Abenaki word meaning &quot;far out island.&quot;

The island was probably long used by the indigenous people of North America as a place for hunting and gathering, and Europeans probably started visiting the island in the 16th century. Early documentation of the island comes from John Josselyn&#x27;s 1671 account of New England:

Sagadehock to Nova Scotia is called the Duke of York&#x27;s Province. Here Pemaquid, Matinicus, Monhegan, Cape Anawhagen…are all filled with dwelling houses and stages for fishermen, and have plenty of cattle, arable lands and marshes.

The island is also mentioned in the May 1717 deposition of two sailors whose trading ship was commandeered off of Cape Cod by pirates from the ship &quot;Whydah&quot;. They testified that they were forced to sail north with the pirates (under captain Richard Noland of the &quot;Whydah&#x27;s&quot; sister ship &quot;Anne Galley&quot;), who then took a launch &quot;to Matinicus, where they took a sloop belonging to Colonel [Stephen] Minot, one shallop belonging to Captain [John] Lane and three schooners.&quot;

In March 1726, Lieutenant Governor Dummer of the Massachusetts Bay Colony documented the early tension between the Native Americans and Europeans in a letter to Captain John Giles:

I very much resent this liberty [the Native Americans at Matinicus] have taken in killing the [livestock] which belong to the English, which is contrary to the Articles of Peace and that common justice which the English and Indians owe to one another. 

In 1750, Ebenezer Hall became the island&#x27;s first permanent settler. Accompanied by his family, he built a house, commenced fishing and farming, and claimed territorial rights to the island. He burned the grass on nearby Green Island to produce hay for his livestock, infuriating the Penobscot tribe, who still used the islands for fishing and sealing. Twice the tribe wrote letters to Royal authorities in Boston, complaining about Hall. In the second, delivered for forwarding on April 25, 1753, to Fort Richmond, they warned, &quot;if you don&#x27;t remove him in two months, we shall be obliged to do it ourselves.&quot; Though Hall was ordered to leave Matinicus, he continued his residence there, and the Penobscots waited not two months but a little over four years before taking action. After a multiple day siege on his house, they killed and scalped Hall on June 10, 1757.

In the following decades several families, including that of Ebenezer Hall&#x27;s son, moved to the island, and at the census of 1790 there was a total population of 59. The population continued to grow, and on October 22, 1840, the island was formally organized as a plantation. 

As a maritime community, the residents of Matinicus have long worked as sailors and fishermen. The early days of fishing for cod, mackerel, and herring gradually gave way to lobster fishing, which continues as the dominant industry on the island today. The importance of this industry to the livelihood of island residents has led to territorial disputes. In July 2009, an island fisherman shot and wounded a fellow fisherman in a dispute over the locations of individual lobster-fishing rights.

The plantation has one church, the Congregational Church of Matinicus, which was built in 1906 and currently holds Sunday services during the summer months and serves as a general community function hall. The island is a routine stop for the Maine Seacoast Mission&#x27;s vessel the &quot;Sunbeam&quot;, which offers pastoral care as well as nursing and telemedicine facilities.

The island&#x27;s inhabitants have served as first responders to emergencies in the waters of Penobscot Bay. On January 16, 1992, residents of Matinicus responded to a distress call from the &quot;O.A. Harkness&quot;, a nearby sinking tugboat, ultimately rescuing the three crew members. On July 17, 2011, island fishermen rescued 4 occupants of an airplane that ditched into the waters off of Matinicus.

Matinicus Island Library, founded in 2016, was featured by Smithsonian Magazine in 2022 for buying books banned by other organizations in the United States. The library is run by volunteers and partially funded by the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation.

==Geography==

Matinicus Isle plantation is an archipelago located on the southeastern fringes of Penobscot Bay in the Gulf of Maine, part of the Atlantic Ocean. According to the United States Census Bureau, the plantation has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Matinicus Island, the largest land mass in the archipelago, spans approximately in length and in width for an area of about . The elevation ranges from 0 to 100 feet (30.5 m). Matinicus Isle is located approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Criehaven Isle.

The shoreline consists of rocky coves and sandy beaches. The island experiences semidiurnal tides with a difference in sea level of up to between high and low tides.

There are ten major fishing grounds around Matinicus Isle that the island&#x27;s fishermen use to catch cod, haddock, pollock, cusk, and lobster.

==Climate==

Matinicus has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm, humid summers and cold winters. Compared to the mainland, seasonal climate fluctuations are somewhat moderated by the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in relatively cooler summers and milder winters. Springs are also some of the coolest in the state, and even the whole country. Summers are almost nonexistent due to the moderating effect of the ocean, which also helps to keep year round temperatures above zero and below 75. The common winter freeze and thaw cycles produce much slush. Nor&#x27;easters, such as the Blizzard of 1978, can be destructive to the shoreline and infrastructure on the island. Tropical disturbances have been known to occasionally strike the area, typically in the late summer and fall, but they are not very common this far north.

==Demographics==

As of the 2010 census, there were 74 people, 41 households, and 16 families residing on Matinicus. The population density was .

The average age of the population was 47.0 years. In terms of age distribution, 20.2% of the population was under the age of 19 years, 66.2% was between the ages of 20 and 64 years, and 13.6% was between the ages of 65 and 84 years. The population was 54.1% male and 45.9% female. The racial makeup of the plantation was 100% white.

The average household size was 1.8 people, and the average family size was 2.8 people. 17.1% of households had individuals under the age of 18 years, and 22.0% had individuals over the age of 64 years. 34.1% of households consisted of married couples living together, and 61.0% were non-families.

There were 147 housing units at an average density of . 41 homes were occupied, and 99 homes were for seasonal, recreational, or occasional use.

As estimated by the American Community Survey, the per capita income for the plantation in 2015 was $28,801, the mean income for a household was $67,000, and the mean income for a family was $123,354. 22.1% of the population was living below the poverty line.

<text>North Haven is a town and island in Knox County, Maine, United States, in Penobscot Bay. The town is both a year-round island community and a prominent summer colony. The population was 417 at the 2020 census. North Haven is accessible by thrice-daily state ferry service from Rockland, or by air taxi from Knox County Regional Airport.

==History==
As early as 3300 BCE, the island was visited by the Red Paint People. Later it became part of the territory of the Penobscot Abenaki Indians, who hunted and fished in canoes along the coast. Captain Martin Pring, an explorer from Bristol, England, &quot;discovered&quot; North Haven and Vinalhaven in 1603. He called them the Fox Islands, a name that survives on the Fox Islands Thoroughfare, a strait separating the towns that provides passage for boats crossing Penobscot Bay.

Settled in the 1760s, North Haven was originally the North Island of Vinalhaven, from which it was set off and incorporated on June 30, 1846, as Fox Isle. It was changed to North Haven on July 13, 1847. In 1850, the state legislature passed an act that gave the majority of island inhabitants &quot;the right to have such roads as they deemed fit.&quot; The majority thereupon decided to have no roads at all, or else roads obstructed with gates or bars at the discretion of landowners. Not surprisingly, the minority of inhabitants petitioned to amend the act.

Fishing and farming became chief occupations. The town&#x27;s surface is even, and farmers produced hay as a staple crop. Boatbuilding became an important industry, and the community still has two boatyards. But many inhabitants were fishermen who caught lobsters, scallops and oysters.

===Summer colony===
In the 1880s, the island was discovered by &quot;rusticators&quot;, seasonal residents first from Boston, then a decade or two later from New York and Philadelphia. North Haven is best known today for its sizable summer colony of prominent northeasterners, particularly Boston Brahmins, drawn to the island for over a century to savor its simple way of life. Among the more notable summer residents was the impressionist painter Frank Weston Benson, who rented the Wooster Farm as a summer home and painted several notable canvases set on the island.

The southern side of the Fox Islands Thoroughfare is often informally considered part of North Haven, since Vinalhaven&#x27;s north shore is nearly a dozen miles from that community&#x27;s town center. In contrast to Vinalhaven, North Haven&#x27;s economy relies less on the lobster industry and more on sustaining its summer resort community. Energy for the community is partially provided by the wind project in Vinalhaven through the Fox Island Electric Cooperative. Although the island is a popular destination, it actually provides few tourist amenities—two inns, a grocery store, two seasonal restaurants, a pizza shop, and two gift shops—and is instead geared toward those with vacation homes on the island.

A small population of Mouflon sheep (native to Europe and western Asia) escaped from an animal enclosure owned by Thomas Watson, Jr. on the island in the 1990s and some of the original population survives today.

==North Haven Dinghy==
In 1885, William Weld challenged the yachtsmen of North Haven to a race. He used the tender from his yacht &quot;Gitana&quot; and unsuccessfully raced against a variety of sprit-sailed boats. That winter he went home and had a better dinghy designed and built in Salem, Massachusetts. The next year he beat all contenders. The boat was hauled out at North Haven, and two copies were made by Henry Calderwood. The subsequent race was between Mrs. Cobb, Miss Spencer and Miss Hayward. The first boats had spritsails, but this soon gave way to gaff rigs. In 1888, James Osman Brown built four more dinghies. This was at the beginning of J. O. Brown &amp; Sons boatyard. The racing fleet grew over the years. They are still raced out of North Haven&#x27;s sailing club, the North Haven Casino, making them the oldest continuously raced class in the United States.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which is land and is water. At its widest points, the island is roughly long and wide. It is in Penobscot Bay and the Gulf of Maine, part of the Atlantic Ocean.

==Education==
North Haven is unusual among Maine island communities in offering a K–12 school; most islands have only elementary schools and send their high school students to schools on the mainland (Vinalhaven, Mount Desert Island, Deer isle and Islesboro are the only other islands to offer K–12 education). North Haven Community School is one of Maine&#x27;s smallest public schools. Its motto is &quot;Competence, Compassion, Challenge and Community.&quot; Notable alumni include Hannah Pingree, who served as Maine&#x27;s Speaker of the House of Representatives for two terms.

<text>Owls Head is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,504 at the 2020 census. A resort and fishing area, the community is home to the Knox County Regional Airport. It includes the village of Ash Point.

==History==
When Samuel de Champlain explored Owl&#x27;s Head in 1605, the Abenaki Indians called it Bedabedec Point, meaning &quot;Cape of the Winds.&quot; Mariners would name it for the shape of the promontory, which they thought resembled the head of an owl. First incorporated as part of Thomaston in 1777, and then as part of South Thomaston in 1848, Owls Head was itself set off and incorporated on July 9, 1921. The town is home to both the Owls Head Light Station, a tall granite lighthouse built in 1826 to mark the southern entrance of Rockland Harbor, and to the Owls Head Transportation Museum.

Owls Head was home to an electric trolley line that traveled to Crescent Beach. It was started in 1902, and it ended in the years of 1917–1918, largely due in part to a deadly accident in 1914, in which a train left the tracks killing one woman instantly, and injuring several others.

In August 1940 (around the 13th), the English composer Benjamin Britten completed his &quot;Diversions for piano&quot; (left hand) and orchestra, Op. 21 while staying at the Owl&#x27;s Head Inn—coincidentally meeting up with Kurt Weill with whom he got on well. On August 22, he wrote from Owl&#x27;s Head to Elizabeth Mayer: &quot;We eventually made Pemaquid Point, but found the place most disappointing—not on the sea, &amp; full of the most terrible Bostonian old ladies, that we left after one gloomy night. Then we came on here which is a grand spot—very unpretentious—but quiet &amp; right on the sea. We can work &amp; there are tennis courts nearby. It is too cold to bathe unfortunately—but there is plenty else to do...&quot;

Owls Head was a filming location for the 2001 movie &quot;In the Bedroom&quot;.

<text>Rockland is a city in and the county seat of Knox County, Maine, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 6,936. The city is a popular tourist destination. It is a departure point for the Maine State Ferry Service to the islands of Penobscot Bay: Vinalhaven, North Haven and Matinicus.

==History==

Abenaki Indigenous People called it Catawamteak, meaning &quot;great landing place.&quot; In 1767, John Lermond and his two brothers from Warren built a camp to produce oak staves and pine lumber. Thereafter known as Lermond&#x27;s Cove, it was first settled about 1769. When in 1777 Thomaston was incorporated, Lermond&#x27;s Cove became a district called Shore village. On July 28, 1848, it was set off as the town of East Thomaston. Renamed Rockland in 1850, it was chartered as a city in 1854.

Rockland developed rapidly because of shipbuilding and lime production. In 1854 alone, the city built eleven ships, three barks, six brigs and four schooners. The city had twelve lime quarries and 125 lime kilns, with upwards of 300 vessels to transport the mineral to various ports in the country.


In March 1877, the Granite Cutters&#x27; International Union was formed in Rockland. It was one of the earliest craft unions in the United States and formed among the region&#x27;s growing granite industry.

By 1886, shipbuilding was surpassed by the lime business, which had twelve manufacturers employing 1,000 workers. Nevertheless, Rockland had three or more shipyards, a marine railway, five sail lofts and two boatbuilders. Other industries included three grain mills, two foundries, three carriage factories, six lumber mills, two machine shops, three cooperies, one tannery, four granite and marble works, two boot and shoe factories, and four printing offices. Fishing was also important. Fleets of Friendship Sloops sailed between the harbor and fishing grounds across Penobscot Bay.

The opening of the Knox and Lincoln Railroad in 1871 brought an influx of tourists. Inns and hotels were established to accommodate them, with the grandest being The Bay Point Hotel in 1889. With a commanding view near the breakwater, the resort offered every luxury and amusement. Renamed The Samoset Hotel in 1902, it was successful until the Great Depression, which began a slow decline. In the age of automobiles, travelers were no longer restricted to the limits of train service, but were free to explore elsewhere. Closed in 1969, the Victorian hotel burned in 1972. A new Samoset Resort opened in 1974.

In 1915, the new super-dreadnought conducted tests and completed her running trials just off the shore from Rockland.

Today, Rockland is an officially designated micropolitan area. Since the early 1990s, Rockland has seen a shift in its economy away from the fishery and toward a service center city. It has also seen a substantial increase in tourism and the downtown has transformed into one of unique shops, boutiques, fine dining and art galleries.

<text>Rockport is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States. It is 35 miles (56.3 km) southeast of Augusta. The population was 3,644 at the 2020 census. Rockport is a popular tourist destination and art colony.

==History==
Rockport, or &quot;the River&quot;, was settled in 1769 by Robert Thorndike. Goose River Village (as it was known until 1852) was originally part of the Megunticook Plantation, incorporated in 1791 as Camden. Shipbuilding, ice harvesting and the manufacture of lime were important early industries. In 1817, three hundred casks of lime were sent to Washington, DC for use in the rebuilding of the United States Capitol, which had been damaged by the British during the War of 1812. In 1852, the citizens of Goose River voted to change their village&#x27;s name to Rockport for its rocky terrain. On February 25, 1891, Rockport officially split from Camden because of a dispute over the cost of constructing a bridge. The town of Rockport was born and from Camden it took half the population, three quarters of the land, and most importantly the profitable lime and ice industries.

Rockport has a longstanding reputation as an artists&#x27; community, with notable artists and art institutions playing a significant role in the town&#x27;s economic and social life. Bay Chamber Concerts was established in 1961 as a continuation of the summer music instruction of the Curtis Institute. Mary Louise Curtis Bok, central to founding both Bay Chamber Concerts and the Curtis Institute, was one of the largest landowners in Rockport, and has been credited with playing a vital role in significantly improving the landscaping of the village&#x27;s inner harbor. At one time she owned most of the eastern shore of the harbor. Mary Lea Park, adjacent to the Rockport Opera House, is named in honor of both her and Rockport resident and violinist Lea Luboshutz.

Rockport was the home of Andre the Seal, a seal adopted by the Goodridge family in 1961, and who was a significant tourist attraction in Rockport Harbor until his death in 1986. The seal&#x27;s &quot;owner&quot; Harry Goodridge co-wrote a book about Andre, titled &quot;A Seal Called Andre&quot;. The 1994 film &quot;Andre&quot; was adapted from the book, although in the movie Andre is actually played by a sea lion, not a seal. A statue of Andre sits beside the harbor in his honor. Rockport is also known for its Belted Galloway cattle. The cattle are raised at the 136-acre Aldermere Farm, which is owned and operated by the Maine Coast Heritage Trust, a statewide land conservation organization. The Belted Galloways remain one of the area&#x27;s most popular attractions, and are often referred to as the &quot;Oreo cookie&quot; cows.

The 1993 Warner Bros. film &quot;The Man Without a Face&quot;, starring Mel Gibson, Universal&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Casper&quot;, and Miramax&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; were filmed in Rockport.

In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine placed Rockport at the top of its list of the prettiest towns in America.

<text>South Thomaston is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,511 at the 2020 census. A fishing and resort area, the town includes the village of Spruce Head.

==History==

Abenaki Indians called it Wessaweskeag, meaning &quot;tidal creek&quot; or &quot;salt creek,&quot; a reference to what is now known as the Weskeag River. Thomas Lefebvre from Quebec, Canada owned a huge tract of land at the Weskeag River, where his stay began in 1704. He built a large gristmill, with a house on the shoreline. Although he would eventually return to Quebec, the area retained his name—Thomas&#x27; Town. But the adjacent St. George River was the uneasy dividing line between land controlled by New England and New France. Permanent settlement would be delayed by the French and Indian Wars, which ended with the 1763 Treaty of Paris.

In 1767, Wessaweskeag was settled by Elisha Snow, who built a sawmill operated by tidal power. In 1773, Joseph Coombs arrived and built another sawmill nearby, and together they built a gristmill. The village of South Thomaston grew around the mills, which would include three granite polishing machines to process stone cut from the town&#x27;s numerous quarries. On July 28, 1848, South Thomaston was set off from Thomaston and incorporated as a separate town. Owl&#x27;s Head would be set off from South Thomaston on July 9, 1921. Joseph Baum and Flora Baum owned and operated the Baum&#x27;s Market, now known as the Keag Store. Flora Baum was the Postmistress, appointed by President Woodrow Wilson. The Baum&#x27;s had four children: Alice, Dorothy, Joan and Joseph Baum, Jr. (Bud). For many years Bud was on the Board of Selectmen and was the Fire Chief.
Gilford Butler was a local attorney and chairman of the school board. Gilford Bulter and his sister Lula Butler lived in what is now known as the Geag Inn, next to the present U. S. Post Office. Gilford was an attorney in nearby Rockland. Gilford left a large amount of his estate to the town in order to build a local elementary school, with the stipulation that the school bear his name.

<text>St. George is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States. It includes the villages of Port Clyde and Tenants Harbor, with the latter being town&#x27;s commercial center. A favorite with artists, writers and naturalists, St. George is home to the Brothers and Hay Ledge nature preserve, comprising four islands off Port Clyde. The town&#x27;s population stands at 2,594 residents, according to the 2020 Census.

==History==

The peninsula and its islands were noted for immense flocks of duck, geese and other waterfowl. Although the region was part of the Waldo Patent, General Samuel Waldo complied with requests from Abenaki Indians not to settle immigrants at what was their prized hunting ground. Consequently, the peninsula remained unpopulated until after the close of the French and Indian Wars in 1763. The Revolutionary War further slowed development, but during the 1780s, there was rapid settlement of the peninsula. It was incorporated in 1789 as part of Cushing. On February 7, 1803, the peninsula and its islands were set off and incorporated as St. George, taking its name from the river.

Farmers grew potatoes. After 1830, granite was quarried and shipped nationally for construction. Shipbuilders annually produced three to four vessels, many for the coasting trade, exporting cordwood, lumber and fish. Factories canned lobsters, clams and sardines. In the 1880s, the town&#x27;s rugged oceanfront beauty was discovered by &quot;rusticators&quot;—visitors, including artists, who bought or built summer cottages.

At the town office, there is a statue of Saint George, the town&#x27;s namesake, fighting the legendary dragon.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Bounded on the west by the Saint George River, the town is located on a peninsula extending into the Gulf of Maine.

St. George is crossed by state route 131. It borders the town of South Thomaston to the north.

Both Allen Island and Mosquito Island House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places for St. George.

== Education ==

According to Roy Meservey, the first school in St. George served the children of Samuel Watts in the 1780s. In 1792, four school districts were laid out, and more were created as the town&#x27;s population grew. At their peak in the late 1800s, there were 18 or 20 schools in St. George. As the population decreased, most of the districts were consolidated, and by the 1950s, only four remained: St. George, Clark&#x27;s Island, Port Clyde, and Tenants Harbor. In 1957, despite strong public opposition, the St. George, Clark&#x27;s Island, and Port Clyde schools were all closed. Only Tenants Harbor remained, which all students since have attended under the unified name &#x27;St. George School.&#x27; St. George School is a public K–8 school operated by the St. George Municipal School Unit, and has 180 students.

St. George High School was established in 1894 in the sail loft over Long&#x27;s Store. Its building was erected in 1900, graduating its first class in 1901. It, too, closed as a result of population decline, graduating its last class in 1962. For the 1962–1963 academic year, high school students attended Georges Valley High School in Thomaston. The old building was used as the new elementary school, before being demolished a few years later and replaced by the current town office and fire station.

Starting in the 2015–2016 academic year, St. George students in grades 9–12 began attending one of five schools of their choice:
* Camden Hills Regional High School
* Lincoln Academy

* Oceanside High School

<text>Vinalhaven is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States. Its town limits include the island of Vinalhaven, the largest of the Fox Islands, and smaller islands, some accessible from Vinalhaven Island by bridge or causeway. The population was 1,279 at the 2020 census. It is home to a thriving lobster fishery and hosts a summer colony. Since there is no bridge to the island, Vinalhaven is primarily accessible from Rockland via an approximately 75-minute state ferry ride across West Penobscot Bay, or by air taxi from Knox County Regional Airport.

==History==

Archeological remains indicate that the island was first inhabited 3800–5000 years ago by the Red Paint People. Later, it became Abenaki territory. Europeans visited in the 16th century, and English Captain Martin Pring named the archipelago Fox Islands in 1603. The first permanent English settlement occurred in 1766 when Thaddeus Carver arrived from Marshfield, Massachusetts, and later purchased from Thomas Cogswell on the southern shore near what became known as Carver&#x27;s Harbor.

Others soon followed to establish the remote fishing and farming community in the Gulf of Maine. Vinalhaven&#x27;s first Anglo families are considered to be Arey, Calderwood, Carver, Coombs, Dyer, Ginn, Greem, Hopkins, Lane, Leadbetter, Norton, Philbrook, Pierce, Roberts, Smith, Warren, and Vinal. On June 25, 1789, Vinalhaven was incorporated as a town, named for John Vinal. Vinal was not an island resident, but the agent who petitioned the Maine General Court to incorporate the new township; nonetheless the name stuck. In 1847, the North Fox Island seceded and became a separate township called North Haven.

Fishing, shipbuilding, logging and shipping were important early businesses on Vinalhaven. High-quality granite was discovered in 1826, and Vinalhaven became one of Maine&#x27;s largest quarrying centers for the next century. Today the island is dotted with abandoned quarries, many of which have since filled with groundwater and are popular swimming holes for residents and visitors. Pinkish-gray Vinalhaven granite excavated by the Bodwell Granite Company can be seen in the State Department Building in Washington, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Union Mutual Life Insurance Building in Boston.

Granite was shipped for customs houses and post offices in New York; St. Louis; Kansas City; Buffalo, etc.; the railroad station and Board of Trade in Chicago; the Washington Monument and federal office buildings in the Capital; the Pennsylvania Railroad Station and the Masonic Temple in Philadelphia; as well as private mansions, monuments, bridges, dams, and thousands of tons of paving blocks for the streets of Portland; Boston; New York; Newark; Philadelphia; and other cities. The Vinalhaven quarries were the only ones deep enough to provide the eight huge polished columns called for in the original plans for the apse of the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in New York City; the massive columns broke under their own weight, and ultimately more than one piece of granite had to be put together to create each column. The quarries also provided foundation stone for the cathedral.

A noted lobster fishing community, Vinalhaven has fishing rights to much of Penobscot Bay and its offshore waters. There are ten major fishing grounds around Vinalhaven that the island&#x27;s fishermen and some Matinicus Isle fishermen have used for centuries to capture such groundfish as cod, haddock, pollock, hake, lobster, scallops and halibut. Shrimp, dogfish, mackerel and herring are also abundant in the waters around Vinalhaven. Vinalhaven lobstermen were the first in the nation to unionize. They began to organize in the winter of 2012–13 after frustration with low lobster prices and disagreements with the Maine Lobstermen&#x27;s Associations leadership.

The 2006 movie &quot;Islander&quot; was filmed in part on Vinalhaven; some locals acted in the movie.

Vinalhaven made news in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic after a group of island residents cut down a tree and dragged it into the road in an attempt to forcibly quarantine three roommates with out-of-state license plates they believed could have the virus. As it turned out the incident was between two groups of workers. One side was Vinalhaven people, the other a crew from New Jersey. The two groups had earlier clashed at a local bar.

Vinalhaven was the scene of a fatal stabbing in the summer of 2020.

==Energy==

Vinalhaven is the site of one of the first large wind power projects on the U.S. east coast. Approved by a vote of 383–5 on July 29, 2008, by members of the Fox Islands Electric Cooperative, the project was expected to significantly reduce rates on the island residents, who previously imported their power from the mainland via a submarine power cable. Three 1.5 MW wind turbine towers, which went online in late 2009, are capable of producing a comparable amount of energy to what the island uses.

Near the end of 2009, an Island Energy Task Force was established to &quot;facilitate a transition to affordable, reliable, domestically produced energy, and on the consumer end, to energy-smart products, with special emphasis on serving the Vinalhaven community.&quot;

Starting in the spring of 2010, the task force began spearheading a project to use some of the Fox Islands wind energy to charge electric thermal storage heaters installed on the island. The charging takes place when the project&#x27;s three turbines are generating more power than the islands need, which is common in the winter.

In operation the turbines have indeed reduced power bills, but at a cost of a loss of quality of life for nearby residents, who complain that the turbines cause constant noise and vibration.

<text>Warren is a town in Knox County, Maine, United States. The population was 4,865 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of East Warren, Warren and South Warren, the latter home to the Maine State Prison and minimum security Bolduc Correctional Facility.

==History==
Part of the Waldo Patent, it was called the Upper Town of St. Georges Plantation. It was first settled by Scots-Irish settlers from Londonderry in 1736 under the auspices of Brigadier-General Samuel Waldo, its proprietor. Development was hindered, however, by the ongoing French and Indian Wars. In 1753, a blockhouse was built and placed under the command of Captain Thomas Kilpatrick, known by terrified Indians as &quot;Tom-kill-the-devil.&quot; War raged across Maine between 1754–1758, and local settlers took refuge in the blockhouse or at another in Cushing.
Hostilities ended in 1759 with the Fall of Quebec. On November 7, 1776, Upper Town of St. Georges Plantation was incorporated as a town, named after Joseph Warren, a Revolutionary War hero.

Hay was the principal crop. Shipbuilding was an important industry, and between 1770–1850, 224 vessels were built, varying from 53 to 1,127 tons. Warren had quarries to extract granite and limestone. Falls on the St. George River provided water power, with the first sawmill built in 1785. Woolens were manufactured at the Georges River Mills, and snowshoes at the Warren Shoe Factory. The Knox and Lincoln Railroad opened on November 6, 1871.

The General Henry Knox Canal system (named after Henry Knox, who purchased the locks in 1794) was initially built by Charles Barrett in 1793 to connect the tidewaters of the St. George River with St. George Lake in Liberty, facilitating the shipment of lumber and lime. But the locks fell into decay following Knox&#x27;s death in 1806. In 1848, the canal was reopened for navigation by the Georges Canal Company at a cost of $80,000. It again fell into disuse following 1877, rendered obsolete by the railroad. The canal banks and one lock may still be seen in Warren, however, uncovered as part of a river beautification project in 1966.

In 1853, Warren elected Olive Rose as County Register of Deeds. She was the first woman to hold elected office in the United States. Warren became a part of Knox county when it was partitioned in 1860 from parts of Waldo and Lincoln counties.

Since 2002, South Warren is home to the Maine State Prison, a 900-bed maximum security facility formerly located in Thomaston since 1824. The prison&#x27;s gift shop, which sells over 600 inmate-made goods, remains in Thomaston at the site of the old prison.

===Peterborough===
In South Warren was the site of Peterborough, a black settlement first founded in 1782. Three possible legends try to explain the foundation of this community. 
One suggests that Amos Peters, a black Revolutionary War veteran from Plymouth, Massachusetts, was working for General Henry Knox. When Peters married another slave named Sarah, Knox gave the couple land to settle on in what later became Peterborough. Following the 1780 Quock Walker court case, Amos and Sarah Peters were freed from slavery. Another story suggests that General Knox, who served in Virginia during the War, built himself a mansion that matched the style of estates he had seen in Virginia. He recruited blacks to serve as staff for the mansion. As space at the estate and servants quarters shrunk, &quot;Knox sent many of the families to live in the settlement started by Amos and Sarah Peters&quot;. Another story suggests that many of the original settlers of the community were so-called &quot;limecoasters&quot;, black deckhands who were part of the Lime trade from Thomaston to the Southern US.

Regardless of the origin, the community grew, having a population of over three hundred people at its peak. In 1823, the population of children in the settlement was enough to warrant its own school. In 1845, the town of Warren provided $75 for the building of a schoolhouse in Peterborough. The school had both black and white teachers, and attendance averaged between twenty-four and thirty students in a given year. The school building also housed church services and social events.

The population of the settlement began to decline by the end of the Civil War. The decline of the shipbuilding industry in the area, coupled with the fact that black people were excluded from factory work, are theorized as some of the factors behind this reduction. The area was populated by descendants of the original settlers until 1961, when William, Grace and Woodrow Peters moved from Peterborough to a house along Route 90. Today the area is made up of newer houses with no residents having roots to the original community.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Drained by the Back River, Warren is located at the head of tide on the banks of the St. George River.

It is crossed by U.S. Route 1 and state routes 90, 131 and 235. It borders the towns of Union to the north, Rockport to the northeast, Rockland to the east, Thomaston to the southeast, Cushing to the south, Friendship to the southwest, and Waldoboro to the west.

<doc id="116051" wikidata="Q3450437" url="?curid=116051" title="Boothbay, Maine">
<text>Boothbay is a town in Lincoln County, Maine, United States. The population was 3,003 at the 2020 census. It includes the neighborhoods of Back Narrows, Dover, Linekin, Oak Hill, Ocean Point, Spruce Shores, and the villages of East Boothbay and Trevett. The surrounding Boothbay Region is a center of summer tourist activity, and a significant part of its population does not live there year-round. Five shipyards are located in the town, the largest of which is Washburn &amp; Doughty.

==History==

The Abenaki people who lived in the region called it Winnegance. The first European presence in the region was an English fishing outpost called Cape Newagen in 1623. An Englishman by the name of Henry Curtis purchased the right to settle Winnegance from the Abenaki Sachem Mowhotiwormet in 1666. However, the English were driven from their settlements by the Abenaki in 1676 during King Philip&#x27;s War. The colonists returned after the war ended. In 1689, during King William&#x27;s War, they were driven out again. Winnegance was abandoned entirely, and remained a desolate waste for 40 years.

Colonel David Dunbar, governor of the Territory of Sagadahock, established a settlement called Townsend, after Lord Charles Townshend, in 1730, and convinced approximately 40 families of Scots-Irish Presbyterians, largely from the north of Ireland, to settle there. Some were veterans of the Revolution of 1688. The settlement survived and was incorporated as the town of Boothbay on November 3, 1764.

Abenaki tribes once summered on Keene Neck, hunting shellfish and leaving behind shell middens. The area was settled as part of Bristol in 1735 by William Hilton from Plymouth, Massachusetts.

In May 1755, Hilton and his three sons were ambushed by Indians while getting out of a boat, mortally wounding the father and killing his namesake.

Settled largely by German immigrants, it developed as a farming and fishing community. On February 19, 1828, the town was set off and incorporated, named after Bremen, Germany.

<text>Bristol, known from 1632 to 1765 as Pemaquid (; today a village within the town), is a town in Lincoln County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,834 at the 2020 census. A fishing and resort area, Bristol includes the villages of New Harbor, Pemaquid, Round Pond, Bristol Mills and Chamberlain. It includes the Pemaquid Archeological Site, a U.S. National Historic Landmark. During the 17th and early 18th century, New France defined the Kennebec River as the southern boundary of Acadia, which put Bristol within Acadia.

==History==

Once territory of the Wawenock (or Walinakiak, meaning &quot;People of the Bay&quot;) Abenaki Indians, early Bristol was one of the most important and embattled frontier settlements in the province. Beginning with seasonal fishing, as early as 1625 the English established at Pemaquid Point a year-round trading post for fur trading. In 1631, the area was granted as the Pemaquid Patent by the Plymouth Council to Robert Aldsworth and Gyles Elbridge, merchants from Bristol, England.

=== Raid on Pemaquid (1632) ===

A village and palisade fort were constructed.

In 1632, Pemaquid was raided and plundered by the pirate Dixie Bull.

The Great Colonial Hurricane on August 15, 1635 sank the galleon &quot;Angel Gabriel&quot; while it was anchored off the settlement, drowning some crew and passengers.

In 1664, the Duke of York (the future King James II) claimed Pemaquid was within his patent, which also included Sagadahoc and recently acquired New Amsterdam. To help anglicize the latter into New York City, Governor Sir Edmund Andros had some of its Dutch inhabitants transported to Pemaquid, now called Jamestown for its royal owner. By 1665, the village had approximately 30 houses.

===King Philip&#x27;s War===

====Raid on Pemaquid (1676)====

During King Philip&#x27;s War, in 1676 Indians attacked and burned English settlements up the coast, including Pemaquid. The following year, a new wooden defense called Fort Charles was built.

===King William&#x27;s War===

====Siege of Pemaquid (1689)====
During King William&#x27;s War—the first of four French and Indian Wars—Fort Charles and the village were attacked and destroyed in 1689 by the French from Castine, Maine. The inhabitants of Pemaquid were either killed or taken prisoner.

====Siege of Pemaquid (1696)====


By 1692, the English regained control of the region, and Sir William Phipps ordered construction of Fort William Henry, named after King William III of England. This time built of stone.

On August 14–15, 1696, the famous Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville captured and destroyed the fort along with a combined force of French and Indians from present-day Castine. Commander of the fort, Captain Pascoe Chubb surrendered the fort. Iberville killed three of the soldiers and sent the other ninety-two back to Boston. In response to this raid Benjamin Church was sent from Boston to attack Acadia.

===Raid on Pemaquid (1717)===

In early May 1717, a sloop under the command of a Captain Carr was captured by ten pirates on a 25-ton sloop (formerly owned by a Colonel Stephen Minot) in Pemaquid. The pirate sloop had come from Monhegan to the south, where on April 29, the Snow (a type of two masted vessel) &quot;Anne&quot; arrived. The &quot;Anne&quot; had originally been captured off the Virginia Capes in April by the pirate Samuel Bellamy in the &quot;Whydah&quot;, which wrecked in a storm on the night of April 26, 1717 off of Cape Cod. The &quot;Anne&quot; made it through the storm with another captured vessel, the &quot;Fisher&quot; (which was soon abandoned and the pirates aboard her transferred to the &quot;Anne&quot;). The pirates arrived at Monhegan on April 29, and waited for the &quot;Whydah&quot;, for the pirates had not seen nor heard about the &quot;Whydah&quot;&#x27;s wrecking in the storm of the night of April 26. The pirates eventually realized the &quot;Whydah&quot; was lost, and proceeded to attack vessels in the area, including Matinicus Island (which is where the sloop the pirates used at Pemaquid was captured from). The attack at Pemaquid was described in a deposition as follows:

...[the pirates] went after Capt. Carr&#x27;s sloop, lying at Pemaquid, which they alsoe took a little distance from said Pemaquid, but finding the Mast and Bowspreat not serviceable [to repair the snow] they left her there, and brought the Master thereof aboard the Snow then at Menhagen [Monhegan]...

The pirates soon left the area, abandoning all the other vessels (including the &quot;Anne&quot;) they had captured and most of their prisoners at Matinicus on or about May 9, 1717 on Minot&#x27;s sloop.

===Father Rale&#x27;s War===

During Father Rale&#x27;s War, the location was a rendezvous for Natives and French to return inhabitants of Pemaquid and vicinity that they had taken prisoner during the war.

Colonel David Dunbar, Surveyor-General of the King&#x27;s Woods, rebuilt the fort in 1729–1730, renaming it Fort Frederick. He renamed the town Harrington after the Earl of Harrington, who had helped arrange the 1729 Treaty of Seville.

===King George&#x27;s War===

====Raid on Pemaquid (1747)====

During King George&#x27;s War, Fort Frederick withstood two attacks in 1747, but in 1759 was decommissioned at the end of the French and Indian Wars.

===American Revolution===

In 1775, the town dismantled the fort to prevent it from becoming a British stronghold during the Revolutionary War. The state acquired the site in 1902, and in 1908 rebuilt the tower of Fort William Henry under guidance of historian John Henry Cartland, using many original stones. In 1993, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark.

===Bristol established===

On June 21, 1765, the town was incorporated as Bristol, named after the home port of the Pemaquid Patent proprietors.

During the War of 1812, the waters off Pemaquid Point saw the capture of HMS &quot;Boxer&quot; by the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; on September 5, 1813. The town would set off land to create Nobleboro in 1788, Bremen in 1828, Damariscotta in 1848 and South Bristol in 1915. Today, Bristol is a popular tourist destination.

<text>Damariscotta (// ) is a town in Lincoln County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,297 at the 2020 census. Damariscotta is the oyster capital of New England. A popular tourist destination, the towns of Damariscotta and Newcastle are linked by the Main Street bridge over the Damariscotta River, forming the &quot;Twin Villages&quot;. The name Damariscotta derives from a native place-name meaning place of abundance of small fish (alewives).

==History==

The area was once inhabited by the Wawenock (or Walinakiak, meaning &quot;People of the Bays&quot;) Abenaki Indians, who left behind 2,500-year-old oyster shell middens along the banks of the Damariscotta River. The Whaleback Shell Midden is now a state historic site. The land became part of the Pemaquid Patent, granted by the Plymouth Council in 1631 to Robert Aldsworth and Gyles Elbridge, merchants from Bristol, England. At Pemaquid (now Bristol), they built a fort and trading post.

Some colonists moved upriver from the village at Pemaquid about 1640 to settle what is today Damariscotta. But the settlements were attacked in 1676 during King Philip&#x27;s War, with the inhabitants either driven off or massacred. Attempts to rebuild alternated with further attacks during the French and Indian Wars. The Province of Massachusetts Bay constructed Fort William Henry at Pemaquid in 1692, but it was destroyed in 1696. The last battle of King William&#x27;s War was on September 9, the Battle of Damariscotta, in which Captain John March killed 25 native men.

Fort Frederick, in 1729, successfully resisted the region&#x27;s final two attacks, and was pulled down at the time of the Revolution so that the British could not occupy it. With peace at last, Damariscotta grew as a trade center. It was incorporated as a separate town on March 15, 1848, set off from parts of Bristol and Nobleboro.

The name Damariscotta is an extreme corruption of the Algonquian word &quot;Madamescontee&quot;, meaning &quot;place of an abundance of alewives&quot;, which are small, salty fish that spawn in Damariscotta Lake. The main village is located at the lower falls and head of navigation on the Damariscotta River. Early industries included two sawmills, a match factory and a tannery. Along the river were established several brickyards, which supplied much of the brick used to build Boston&#x27;s Back Bay neighborhood. Shipbuilding in particular brought Damariscotta wealth in the 1800s, when clipper ships were launched at the town&#x27;s shipyards. During that time, many fine examples of Federal, Greek Revival and Italianate style architecture were erected, giving the old seaport a considerable charm which each summer attracts throngs of tourists. Damariscotta is home of the Skidompha Public Library, whose name is an acronym formed from the first letter of several founders&#x27; surnames.

The terminus of the Damariscotta River is the Great Salt Bay, a mating area for horseshoe crabs in North America, and the state&#x27;s first marine protected area. The river is home to 80% of the farmed oysters produced in Maine.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Damariscotta is situated on the Damariscotta River, a tidal estuary of the Gulf of Maine. Hunt Hill, at an elevation of 350 feet (108 m) above sea level, is the town&#x27;s highest point.

<text>Dresden is a town in Lincoln County, Maine, United States, that was incorporated in 1794. The population was 1,725 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town was originally settled in 1752 under the name Frankfort by French and German Huguenots, who were part of the first wave of French-speaking immigrants to arrive in Maine, but were distinguished from later arrivals by their Protestant faith. William Shirley built Fort Shirley in the community at the same time Fort Halifax (Maine) was built. The town was incorporated as Pownalborough in 1760, when Lincoln County was created in the Maine District of Massachusetts. Pownalborough included the Town of Wiscasset, which was soon set off on its own as the shire town of the county. When the present territory was incorporated in 1794, Lincoln County Probate Judge Jonathan Bowman chose Dresden as the new name of the town because he liked the sound of it.

Dresden is located on the eastern side of the Kennebec River. Historic sites include an old, brick school building and the Pownalborough Courthouse, which is now used as a museum and is open to the public. The Pownalborough Courthouse was built in 1760 and was the first seat of government east of the Kennebec River. The families who settled Dresden and those who were soon afterward sent there by the government of Massachusetts played a crucial role in the battle for American independence in Maine.
Robert Treat Paine, John Hancock, and John Adams appeared at the Court House in the Revolutionary Era. Well known local families included the Goodwins, Houdlettes, Mayerses, Bridges, Bowmans, Percys, Johnsons, and Trussells, who variously left their marks on the history of the town, the state, and the country.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Dresden is drained by the Kennebec River and the Eastern River, which merges into the former at the southern tip of Green Point and the southeastern side of Swan Island. The Eastern River has long been a favored spot to fish for smelt in shacks centered above holes made in the winter ice.

Dresden&#x27;s other notable geographical features are Blinn Hill and The Great Bog. At 440 feet (134 m) above sea level, Blinn Hill affords a view of the White Mountains, more than away. The Great Bog is primeval and lies not far from the natural foot of Blinn Hill.

<text>Monhegan () is an island in the Gulf of Maine. A plantation, a minor civil division in the state of Maine falling between unincorporated area and a town, it is located approximately off the mainland and is part of Lincoln County, Maine, United States. The population was 64 at the 2020 census. The plantation comprises its namesake island and the neighboring island of Manana. The island is accessible by scheduled boat service from Boothbay Harbor, New Harbor and Port Clyde. Visitors&#x27; cars are not allowed on the island. It was designated a United States National Natural Landmark for its coastal and island flora in 1966.

==History==
The name Monhegan is a corruption of &quot;Monchiggon&quot;, the Abenaki language term for &quot;out-to-sea island&quot; used by Samoset, an Abenaki sagamore and the first Native American to make contact with the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony, in his early contacts with the English. European explorers Martin Pring visited in 1603, Samuel de Champlain in 1604, George Weymouth in 1605 and Captain John Smith in 1614. The island got its start as a British fishing camp prior to settlement of the Plymouth Colony. Cod was harvested from the rich fishing grounds of the Gulf of Maine, then dried on fish flakes before shipment to Europe. A trading post was built to conduct business with the Indians, particularly in the lucrative fur trade. It was Monhegan traders who taught English to Samoset, the chieftain who in 1621 startled the Pilgrims by boldly walking into their new village at Plymouth and saying: &quot;Welcome, Englishmen.&quot; On 28 January 1623 the Council for New England issued a commission for seizing the &quot;Island of Mannahigan&quot;. Settlement by William Vengham and William Pomfret in 1623 caused William Bradford to include Monhegan among places that experienced &quot;scattered beginnings&quot; that year.

On April 29, 1717, Monhegan was visited by the &quot;Anne&quot;, a small square-rigged snow crewed by pirates. She had originally been captured off the Virginia Capes in April by the pirate Samuel Bellamy in the &quot;Whydah&quot;, which wrecked in a storm on the night of April 26, 1717, off Cape Cod. The &quot;Anne&quot; made it through the storm with another captured vessel, the &quot;Fisher&quot; (which was soon abandoned and the pirates aboard her transferred to the &quot;Anne&quot;). The pirates, led by Richard Noland, arrived at Monhegan on April 29, and waited for the &quot;Whydah&quot;, for the pirates had not seen or heard about the &quot;Whydah&quot; wrecking in the storm of the night of April 26. The pirates eventually realized the &quot;Whydah&quot; was lost, and proceeded to attack vessels at Matinicus Island and Pemaquid (now Bristol). They outfitted for their own uses a small 25-ton sloop belonging to Colonel Stephen Minot they had captured off Matinicus. They abandoned all the other captured vessels (including the &quot;Anne&quot;) and most of their prisoners at Matinicus on or about May 9, 1717, on Minot&#x27;s sloop.

Despite success as a fishing and trade center, Monhegan would be caught in the conflict between New England and New France for control of the region. During King Philip&#x27;s War (1675-1678), dispossessed English settlers from the mainland sought refuge on the island before being relocated elsewhere along the coast. During King William&#x27;s War (1688-1697), the island was captured for the Kingdom of France in 1689 by Baron de Saint-Castin. He destroyed the fishing fleet and burned the buildings, with many inhabitants escaping to Massachusetts. But even during periods when Monhegan was abandoned, its convenient offshore harbor remained a stopover destination for ships. The end of the French and Indian War in 1763 brought peace to the area, and on September 4, 1839, Mohegan—again under English Colonial control—was incorporated as an island plantation.

In 1824, a conical stone lighthouse was built on the island by order of Congress and President James Monroe. Damaged by storms, it was replaced in 1850 by the present 48 foot (14.6 m) granite tower, with a fog bell station built in 1855 on nearby Manana Island. The island&#x27;s of good land encouraged agriculture, with potatoes the chief crop. But fishing was always the most important industry, whether locally or at the Grand Banks. Today, it still dominates Monhegan&#x27;s economy.
From October 1 through June, fishermen harvest lobsters from the only lobster conservation area in the state of Maine.

Henry Trefethen was one of the original purchasers of Monhegan Island. The Trefethen House, the oldest house on Monhegan Island, served as a hotel for island visitors, and remains standing today.

===Artist colony===
The beginnings of the art colony on Monhegan date to the mid-19th century; by 1890, it was firmly established. Two of the early artists in residence from the 1890s, William Henry Singer (1868–1943) and Martin Borgord (1869–1935), left Monhegan to study at the Académie Julian in 1901. Among many early members who found inspiration on the island were summer visitors from the New York School of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, such as Robert Henri, Frederick Judd Waugh, George Bellows, Edward Hopper and Rockwell Kent.

Later members of the artist colony have included Jay Hall Connaway, Abraham Bogdanove, Andrew Winter, Reuben Tam, Frances Kornbluth, Elena Jahn, Lynne Drexler, Edward Betts, and Jamie Wyeth. The 150-foot (50 m) northside cliffs at Blackhead have drawn the interest of Monhegan artists, including Kent, Hopper, and Kornbluth.
The Monhegan Museum celebrated more the continuing draw of the island for artists in a 2014 exhibit entitled, &quot;The Famous and the Forgotten: Revisiting Monhegan&#x27;s Celebrated 1914 Art Exhibition.&quot;
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the island has a total area of , of which is land and (80.97%) is water. Monhegan is an island long and .75 of a mile (1.2 kilometers) wide, located in the Gulf of Maine, part of the Atlantic Ocean. Adjacent Manana Island helps form Monhegan Harbor.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 75 people, 46 households, and 21 families residing in the plantation. The population density was . There were 177 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the plantation was 97.33% White and 2.67% Asian.

There were 46 households, out of which 13.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 32.6% were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 54.3% were non-families. Of all households 47.8% were made up of individuals, and 4.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.63 and the average family size was 2.24.

In the plantation the population was spread out, with 10.7% under the age of 18, 8.0% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 37.3% from 45 to 64, and 14.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 48 years. For every 100 females, there were 127.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 116.1 males.

The median income for a household in the plantation was $26,250, and the median income for a family was $53,125. Males had a median income of $36,563 versus $13,333 for females. The per capita income for the plantation was $20,568. There were 10.5% of families and 3.8% of the population living below the poverty line, including 10.0% of under eighteens and none of those over 64.

==Sites of interest and outdoor activities==
Summer months bring artists and tourists on several daily ferries. Visitors arrive at the ferry landing or on a beach in the village precinct. The village includes a church, private homes, hotels, art studios, private homes for rent and a few small stores, including one that sells fresh fish/lobster. Much of Monhegan is uninhabited and open for exploration on of hiking trails, which lead to high cliffs overlooking the sea. Inland paths lead through woods, including the Cathedral Woods. A tradition of building miniature &quot;fairy houses&quot; from found materials in Cathedral Woods and other areas has brought controversy, guidance and even destruction of non-compliant constructions.

The hill above the village is the site of the Monhegan Island Light, which offers a view of the village, the harbor, Manana Island, and across the sea to the west. Adjacent to the lighthouse is the Monhegan Museum, which is open middays from late June through September; the museum houses artifacts, reflecting the island&#x27;s history.

The island is on the Atlantic flyway and is a stopover for migrating birds and the birdwatchers who come seasonally to observe them.

Monhegan&#x27;s library was founded as the &quot;Jackie and Edward Library&quot;, named after two children who were lost to high waves on the island&#x27;s shoreline, and specialized in children&#x27;s literature. It became the &quot;Monhegan Memorial Library&quot; and broadened its literary selection.

==Education==
In 2005, the Monhegan Island School had seven students, ages five through 12 (kindergarten through eighth grade), all taught by a single teacher; high-school students must attend school on the mainland. The schoolhouse reportedly also serves as a community center, which is site of the annual Christmas play and community dinner.

<text>Newcastle is a town in Lincoln County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,848 at the 2020 census. The village of Newcastle is located in the eastern part of the town, on the Damariscotta River. Together with the village of Damariscotta linked by the Main Street bridge, they form the Twin Villages (see Damariscotta-Newcastle CDP).

==History==

Originally called Sheepscot Plantation, Newcastle was first settled in the 1630s by fishermen and around 50 families. Around 1649–1650, John Mason purchased a tract of land from the sachems Chief Robinhood and Chief Jack Pudding. The territory was claimed in 1665 by the Duke of York. Renamed New Dartmouth, the plantation was attacked and destroyed in 1676 during King Philip&#x27;s War. When the war was over, some of the inhabitants returned. But it was destroyed again in 1689 during King William&#x27;s War, and the village was not reoccupied for about 40 years. In 1730, Colonel David Dunbar, the superintendent and governor of the Province of Sagadahoc, resettled it as Newcastle, named in honor of the Duke of Newcastle.

In 1978, the village of Sheepscot on the Sheepscot River in western Newcastle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Sheepscot Historic District. It includes 51 buildings in the Italianate, Greek Revival, and Federal styles, on . (The USGS recognizes Sheepscott, Shepscooke, Shippscutt, and Shipscot as variants of the name Sheepscot.)

<text>South Bristol is a town in Lincoln County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,127 at the 2020 census. A fishing and resort area, South Bristol includes the villages of Walpole and Christmas Cove, the latter on Rutherford Island. The town has six nature preserves.

==History==

The town was once territory of the Wawenock (or more precisely Walinakiak, meaning &quot;People of the Bays&quot;) Abenaki people, who traveled in canoes to hunt for fish, shellfish, seals and seafowl. In 1614, Captain John Smith explored the coast, and is said to have named Christmas Cove when he visited it on Christmas Day. The land was subsequently part of the Pemaquid Patent, granted by the Plymouth Council for New England in 1631 to Robert Aldsworth and Gyles Elbridge, merchants from Bristol, England, from which the town derives its name.

A palisade fort and settlement were built on the adjacent Pemaquid Peninsula. Between 1630 and 1650, the area was the center for fur trading in Maine. It was attacked and rebuilt repeatedly during the French and Indian Wars, with the final two attacks occurring in 1747 at Fort Frederick. In 1765, Bristol was incorporated as a town, with South Bristol its western portion. On March 26, 1915, South Bristol was set off and incorporated as a separate town.

In the 1800s, the village of Walpole was noted for brickmaking and ice harvesting. Brickyards along the Damariscotta River supplied many of the bricks used to build Boston&#x27;s Back Bay neighborhood. The ice business faded with the advent of refrigeration, but the Thompson Ice House, established in 1826, is now preserved as the Thompson Ice Harvesting Museum. The Bristol Yacht Building Company, later known as H.F. Gamage Shipbuilding, built minesweepers for the United States Navy during World War II. Shipbuilding has remained important, with schooners, fishing trawlers, lobster boats and yachts constructed at the town. The Hudson River Sloop &quot;Clearwater&quot; was built here in 1968. Other industries in South Bristol are fishing, lobstering, clamming, aquaculture and tourism.

The peninsula and Rutherford Island were connected by a swing bridge, one of only three in Maine, which spanned &quot;The Gut.&quot; In 2017 the swing bridge was replaced with a safer drawbridge. For well over a century, Rutherford Island in particular has been a vacation destination for families from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. Many homes on the island are owned by these families.

==Geography==
The town is in southern Lincoln County, bordered to the west by the tidal Damariscotta River, to the east by Johns Bay and the tidal Johns River, and to the south by the Atlantic Ocean. The southern one-third of the town is on Rutherford Island, separated from the mainland by The Gut. The island was named after the Reverend Robert Rutherford, who came with David Dunbar&#x27;s group to the area from North Ireland in 1729. The village of South Bristol is on both sides of The Gut, while Christmas Cove is at the south end of Rutherford Island, and the locales of West Bristol and Walpole are to the north on the mainland. The town of Bristol is to the east and north, while the towns of Newcastle, Edgecomb, and Boothbay (listed from north to south) are to the west across the Damariscotta River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of South Bristol has a total area of , of which are land and , or 55.85%, are water.

The town is crossed by Maine State Route 129. The highway leads north to Damariscotta, from South Bristol village.

<text>Southport is a town and island in Lincoln County, Maine, United States. The population was 622 at the 2020 census. It includes the neighborhoods of Capitol Island, Cozy Harbor, East Side, Newagen, Pine Cliff, and West Southport, and the village of Squirrel Island. The majority of the town&#x27;s residents live on its main island, Southport Island.

==History==
The Abenaki people who originally inhabited the island called it Capanewagen. Cape Newagen, an English corruption of the Abenaki name, was the name of an early English fishing outpost at the southern tip of the island. The island would later be known as Newagen Island by Europeans.

While the first European settlement was established in 1623, the island was abandoned by the English when they were driven from the region by the Abenaki during King Phillip&#x27;s War in 1676. After the war, colonists returned to the island, only to be driven out again during King William&#x27;s War in 1689.

After 40 years, colonists again returned to the region in 1730, and established a settlement called Townsend, named after Lord Charles Townshend. In 1764, the settlement was officially incorporated as the town of Boothbay. On February 12, 1842, the island split from Boothbay, becoming incorporated as Townsend. On June 12, 1850, Townsend changed its name to Southport, after Southport, England.

<text>Andover is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 752 at the 2020 census. Set among mountains and crossed by the Appalachian Trail, Andover is home to the Lovejoy Covered Bridge and is the site of the Andover Earth Station.

==History==
The land which became known as Andover was originally purchased in 1788 by a group of proprietors mostly from Andover, Massachusetts. The original proprietors were Jonathan Abbot, Philip Abbott, Ebenezer Adams, Ingalls Bragg, Samuel Farnum, Samuel Johnson, Abiel Lovejoy, Benjamin Poor, Eben Poor, Jr., and Theodore Stevens, all of Andover, Massachusetts; John York of Bethel, Massachusetts; Joseph Frye of Fryeburg, Massachusetts; and Josiah Bean, Ezekiel Merrill, and Thomas Poor of Methuen, Massachusetts. The town was first settled in 1789 by Ezekiel Merrill and his family who were transported there from Bethel, Maine, in canoes managed by members of the local Pequawket tribe. The first saw-mill was built on the East Branch of the Ellis River by Col. Thomas Poor in 1791 and was used to provide the lumber for the still standing Merrill-Poor House.

The town was incorporated on June 23, 1804, as East Andover, and then renamed Andover in 1820 when Maine separated from Massachusetts.

Occupations for early inhabitants primarily included agriculture and lumbering. As the town developed, local factories made doors, sash, blinds, starch, cheese, boots, shoes, edge-tools, carriages, and harness. The town also had a tannery. Located on an intervale surrounded by mountains, Andover is noted for &quot;its grand and beautiful scenery,&quot; with streams abounding in trout. After the Civil War, the town became a popular destination for sportsmen, especially fishermen attracted by the nearby Richardson Lakes. A hotel was built to accommodate the influx of tourists.

In 1960, Andover was selected to be site of the Andover Earth Station, completed in 1962. It was the location of the first live transatlantic television signal broadcast by satellite Telstar 1.

<text>Bethel is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,504 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of Bethel and West Bethel. The town is home to Gould Academy, a private preparatory school, and is near the Sunday River ski resort.

==History==

An Abenaki Indian village was once located on the north side of the Androscoggin River, but had been abandoned before its subsequent English settlement. In 1769, the township was granted as Sudbury-Canada by the Massachusetts General Court to Josiah Richardson of Sudbury, Massachusetts and others (or their heirs) for services at the Battle of Quebec in 1690. It was first settled in 1774 when Nathaniel Segar of Newton, Massachusetts started clearing the land.

The Revolutionary War, however, delayed many grantees from taking up their claims. Only 10 families resided at Sudbury-Canada when it was plundered on August 3, 1781, during the last Indian attack in Maine. Two inhabitants, Benjamin Clark and Nathaniel Segar, were abducted and held captive in Quebec until the war&#x27;s conclusion, after which the community grew rapidly. On June 10, 1796, Sudbury-Canada Plantation was incorporated as Bethel, the name taken from the Book of Genesis and meaning &quot;House of God.&quot;

In 1802, a trade road (now Route 26) was completed from Portland to Errol, New Hampshire, passing through Bethel and bringing growth. More settlers and businesses arrived. Crops were planted on fertile intervales and meadows formerly cultivated by Indians. Bethel became one of the best farming towns in the state, especially for hay and potatoes. In winter, farmers found work logging, with the lumber cut at sawmills operated by water power from streams. Other manufacturers produced flour, leather and harnesses, furniture, boots and shoes, carriages, and marble and granite work. The Bethel House, a large hotel, was built in 1833.

On March 10, 1851, the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad opened to Bethel, carrying freight and summer tourists eager to escape the noise, heat and pollution of cities. Between the Civil War and World War I, Bethel was a fashionable summer resort. Several hotels were built facing the common or on Bethel Hill. Begun in 1863, The Prospect Hotel was the largest, with a cupola from which guests could observe the mountains. Tally-ho coaches provided tours through wilderness landscapes of the White Mountains and Maine. Dr. John G. Gehring&#x27;s famed clinic for nervous disorders attracted many wealthy patients. Between 1897 and 1926, a number of figures in the music world performed at the Maine Music Festivals organized by William Rogers Chapman. But with the advent of the automobile, tourists were no longer restricted by the limits of train service, but were free to explore. Consequently, many big hotels built near the tracks lost patrons, declined and were eventually torn down. The Prospect Hotel was largely destroyed by fire in 1911. Although transportation patterns and preferences in vacation accommodations have changed, Bethel remains a tourist destination for its natural setting, history and recreation resources.

==Organizational development==

Beginning in 1947 Bethel became the site of &quot;pioneering work&quot; in organizational development. Led by psychologist Kurt Lewin and, eventually, colleagues like Ken Benne and Ron Lippitt, research was conducted that helped lay the foundation for organizational development&#x27;s theory and practice. T-groups and sensitivity training were refined to apply behavioral science to individual self-awareness and group functioning, in the service of organizational efficiency and productivity. The National Training Laboratories (NTL) was organized by Lewin to lead this work, with much or it conducted during summer seasons at Gould Academy. These seasonal research and training sessions were well attended, attracting participants from across the country and around the world. Increasingly, NTL became an important part of Bethel&#x27;s economy, especially as the traditional wood product mill industries went into decline. Although NTL moved its headquarters to Alexandria, Virginia in 2008, it continues to maintain a small summer legacy presence in Bethel.

==Geography==

Bethel is located on the western edge of the Oxford Hills and on the southern rim of the rugged Mahoosuc Range. Nearby Locke and Barker Mountains lie within the Mahoosuc Range, which is a subrange of the White Mountains, a part of the Northern Appalachian Mountains. Bethel and the surrounding area is drained by the Androscoggin River and its tributaries: the Alder, Pleasant and Sunday Rivers. The north edge of Songo Pond lies within Bethel&#x27;s boundary. Just south of the boundary are located South Pond, North Pond and Bryant Ponds. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Brownfield is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,631 at the 2020 census. Brownfield is home to the Stone Mountain Arts Center.

==History==

The area was once territory of the Pequawket Abenaki Indians, whose main village was located at what is today Fryeburg. It was granted on January 23, 1764, by the Massachusetts General Court to Captain Henry Young Brown for his services in the French and Indian Wars. Settlement began about 1765. Brown was required to settle 38 families by June 10, 1770, with a minister recruited by three years after that. Unfortunately, a portion of the original grant was found to lie in New Hampshire.
Replacement land in Maine was granted to Brown on June 25, 1766. It was called Brownfield Addition, one part of which now lies within Hiram and Denmark. The township was first organized as Brownfield Plantation, named in honor of its principal proprietor. On February 20, 1802, it was incorporated as Brownfield. By the War of 1812, it had nearly 900 residents.

Farming was the chief occupation, with the Saco River providing water power for industry. Products of the mills included flour, long lumber, barrel staves, rocking chairs, clothing, carriages, sleighs and . After the Civil War, the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad passed through the town, following the general course of the river.

But the Great Fires of 1947 would destroy 85% of Brownfield. In an effort to replace lost commerce, a ski resort was proposed for Burnt Meadow Mountain. It opened in 1971 with a T-bar lift, but after being renamed Zodiac Skiway in 1980, closed in 1982. Today, the T-bars are still hanging in place.
In 2002, Brownfield celebrated its 200th anniversary.

==Geography==

<text>Byron is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 103 at the 2020 census. Home to Coos Canyon on the Swift River, Byron includes the village of Houghton.

==History==
It was settled as Township No. 8, then incorporated on January 24, 1833, as Byron, named for the English poet Lord Byron. Nicknamed Hop City, agriculture was the principal occupation. Crops included wheat, corn, potatoes and oats. Lumbering was extensive in winter, with two sawmills operating. The Rumford Falls &amp; Rangeley Lakes Railroad was completed in 1896, carrying freight, tourists and &quot;rusticators&quot; from Rumford up the Swift River valley through Byron and Houghton to Mooselookmeguntic Lake.

The Swift River is a popular place to either pan for gold or swim at Coos Canyon, a high gorge where the water depth occasionally exceeds . Just down river from the gorge is a small local beach, called Toby&#x27;s Beach. And a 20-foot ledge, popular during the summer, for daring jumpers.

There is a camping area off state route 17, across from Coos Canyon.

In March 2013, the town sought to require all homes in the town to possess at least one firearm, not unlike Kennesaw, Georgia&#x27;s similar 1982-origin local ordinance.

Bryon is the home of Anthony Boucher, NCAA Division III Cross Country Runner.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Set on either side of a narrow, uneven intervale in the Western Maine Mountains, Byron is drained by the Swift River.

The town is crossed by state route 17. It borders the towns of Roxbury to the south, Andover to the west, and unincorporated townships to the north and east.

<text>Canton is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. Canton is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. The population was 1,125 at the 2020 census. Located beside Lake Anasagunticook, Canton is a summer recreational area.

==History==

Canton Point was the site of Rockemeka, village of the Anasagunticook (or Androscoggin) Abenaki Indians. It is said the tribe had cleared to raise corn. By 1757 the tribe population was devastated by smallpox.

The land became part of a grant the Massachusetts General Court awarded to Captain Joseph Phipps and 63 other soldiers for their services during the French and Indian War. Called Phipps-Canada, it was incorporated in 1795 as Jay in honor of John Jay, the first chief justice of the U. S. Supreme Court. On February 5, 1821, Canton was set off from Jay and incorporated, named after Canton, Massachusetts.

Settlement began in the early 1790s when William Livermore, William French, Joseph Coolidge, and Alexander Shepherd arrived. Others followed, principally from Massachusetts. The surface of the town is uneven in the outskirts, but smooth and level at Canton Point, where the soil was considered unsurpassed in the state for agriculture. The outlet of Lake Anasagunticook provided water power for industry. Gustavus Hayford settled here in 1814. In addition to a log cabin, he built a sawmill and gristmill. First called Hayford Mills, it was renamed Canton Mills, and then Canton. In the 19th century, it had a machine shop to manufacture farm implements, a tinware factory, and an iron foundry. It remains the business center. The Rumford Branch of the Maine Central Railroad passed through the town in the late 1850s, carrying freight and also tourists. The community developed as a resort area for camping.

In December 2005 the town began a project to relocate the town center and about 60 homes on the floodplains surrounding the Androscoggin River due to frequent spring flooding. Proposals have been floated to replace the vacated lots with parkland or nature trails.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has an area of , of which is land and is water. Situated beside Lake Anasagunticook, Canton is drained by Whitney Brook and the Androscoggin River.

The town is served by state routes 108 and 140. It borders the towns of Jay to the northeast, Hartford to the south, Peru to the west, and Dixfield to the northwest.

<text>Denmark is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,197 at the 2020 census. A number of ponds and lakes are located within the town.

==History==
The land was once part of Pequawket (now Fryeburg), village of the Sokokis Abenaki Indians. Attacked by Captain John Lovewell in 1725 during Dummer&#x27;s War, the tribe abandoned the area and fled to Canada. The township combined a grant made by the Massachusetts General Court to Fryeburg Academy, Foster&#x27;s Gore and a strip from Brownfield. Several settlers came from Andover, Massachusetts. It was incorporated as Denmark on February 20, 1807, and named in a show of solidarity with Denmark. That country&#x27;s capital, Copenhagen, was attacked in 1801 and 1807 by the Royal Navy, which in 1775 had attacked Portland.

Farmers found the soil to be very stony and sandy, producing fair yields of potatoes, corn and oats. But the town did have excellent water powers at the streams, and mills were established to manufacture grain, long lumber, barrel staves, sashes, blinds and doors. Denmark Village was established at the foot of Moose Pond, whose outlet, Moose Pond Brook, provided the best water-power site. Today, the town is site of summer camps. Camp Wyonegonic, founded 1902, is the oldest girls&#x27; camp in the country. Also in Denmark is Camp Walden, established in 1916. Founded in 1994, the Denmark Arts Center is the latest addition to the town&#x27;s culture.

<text>Hanover is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 286 at the 2020 census. The town is a popular vacation and recreation area.

==History==

The area was first settled in 1774 by Nathaniel Segar from Newton, Massachusetts. Phineas Howard from Temple, New Hampshire purchased from Massachusetts in 1792 the unoccupied land in the township, including Howard Pond. The community became known as Howard&#x27;s Gore. Combined with a portion of Bethel separated by the Androscoggin River, it then became Hanover, named by its German settlers for the House of Hanover. It was incorporated on February 14, 1843.

Endowed with fine loam soil, farming became an early business. Indeed, Hanover was known for having some of the best intervale farms in the state. A variety of crops were grown, the chief being hay. The outlet of Howard Pond provided water power for industry. At Hanover Village, 12 mills were established. They produced flour, woolens, furniture, short and long lumber, sash, blinds and doors, dowels and rakes. Other goods included leather, boots and shoes. By the early 1950s, however, the last mills had declined and closed. More recently, Hanover has become a site for both year-round homes and vacation properties.
