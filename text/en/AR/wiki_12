<text>Perryville is a town in Cecil County, Maryland, United States. The population was 4,361 at the 2010 census. The town is located near an exit for Interstate 95, on the north side of the outlet of the Susquehanna River.

==History==
Perryville was first settled by Europeans in 1622, when Edward Palmer was granted a patent for a settlement on what is now Garrett Island. During the 17th century, Lord Baltimore granted George Talbot of land, which included the Perryville area. Before incorporation (1882), the settlement was known as Lower Ferry (circa 1695), Susquehanna (circa 18th century), and was finally named Perryville after Mary Perry, the wife of John Bateman.

During the Revolutionary War, Perryville served as a staging area for the Continental Army. Colonel John Rodgers (1728–1791), who operated the ferry and tavern in Perryville, raised the 5th Company of the Maryland Militia. This company became part of the famous Flying Camp and was instrumental during the early stages of the Revolutionary War. George Washington stopped frequently at Rodgers Tavern on his travels from Virginia to New York. Rodgers Tavern was listed on the National Register of Historic Places during 1972. Colonel Rodgers&#x27; son, John Rodgers, was instrumental in suppressing the Tripolitan pirates in the Mediterranean Sea and was subsequently promoted to Commodore of the Mediterranean Squadron. Commodore Rodgers served with distinction during the War of 1812 and is known as the &quot;Father of the American Navy.&quot;

During the 19th century, Perryville was the midway station for the Wilmington to Baltimore Rail Line. During the American Civil War, the railway line between Perryville and Baltimore was destroyed. To transport troops and munitions to Annapolis, the Union Army again began the operation of the ferry across the Susquehanna. The Principio Furnace is located nearby and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

During the 20th century, it was an important destination for those going to the United States Naval Training Center Bainbridge, Maryland, about three miles up the road, now no longer functioning and sold by the Navy. Perryville continued to serve as a railroad town. The interstate highway system, with access near Perryville, brought business from highway travelers.

Perryville is currently home to the Perry Point Veteran&#x27;s Medical Center, located on a picturesque campus at the outlet of the Susquehanna River into Chesapeake Bay. This same location is also the Northeast Campus of AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps, a residential national service program which recruits young Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 to perform community service in various locations in the country.

Perryville is the northern terminus of the MARC Penn Line commuter rail service, which runs south to Washington, D.C. via Baltimore. The 1905-built station also serves as a railroad museum and an Amtrak maintenance facility.

Perryville is home to the largest linwood tree in Maryland, located at 50 Millcreek Road on an estate known formerly as the Anchorage. Perryville is also home to numerous historical sites including the Principio Furnace.

<text>Port Deposit is a town in Cecil County, Maryland, United States. It is located on the east bank of the Susquehanna River near its discharge into the Chesapeake Bay. The population was 653 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

Port Deposit is located at (39.610915, -76.100172).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

It is the westernmost incorporated municipality in Cecil County, as well as in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area, better known as the Delaware Valley.

==History==

===Early history===
The first recorded European visits to the area were the 1608 and 1609 expeditions led by Captain John Smith up the Chesapeake Bay. He sailed about up the Susquehanna River to the present location of Port Deposit, and gave the name of &quot;Smythe Fayles&quot; to the rapids just above the future town.

===The upper ferry===

In 1729, Thomas Cresap established a regular ferry service near Smith&#x27;s Falls (in the upper Port Deposit area) crossing the Susquehanna to Lapidum; this was referred to as Smith&#x27;s Ferry or Upper Ferry. In 1731, a road from Susquehanna Upper Ferry toward Philadelphia, as far as the jurisdiction extends, was authorized. In the same year, in the jurisdiction south of the river, a petition was submitted for a road from the mill at &#x27;Rock Run&#x27; to Peach Bottom, Pennsylvania. This upper ferry was later purchased by Colonel John Creswell and came to be known as &#x27;Creswell&#x27;s Ferry&#x27;.

This location, and Lapidum across the river, were the northernmost navigable deepwater ports on the Susquehanna. River barges and wagons loaded with lumber, grain, coal, whiskey, tobacco, and other goods floated downriver to this &quot;port of deposit&quot;, where cargo could be transferred to ships from the Chesapeake. In the early days, it was difficult to float goods downriver, since there were many rapids and hazards, but it remained the most convenient way for goods to leave much of the country drained by the Susquehanna above the falls. Further, since a number of roads converged at the ferry crossing, goods could be carted or &quot;rolled.&quot;

As early as the 1790s, the forests on the Susquehanna were being logged and the timbers floated downriver to points near the ferry landing. In 1812, the town was platted as Creswell&#x27;s Landing; months later, Governor Levin Winder signed a bill officially naming the town Port Deposite (it would lose the trailing &quot;e&quot; at some point in the future).

===The canal===
The Susquehanna Canal (which had several owners and names over the years, including the Maryland Canal) was completed in 1812 and contributed much toward the town&#x27;s growth. Until the canal was placed in service bypassing Smith&#x27;s Falls, most of the traffic stopped at Lapidum, across the Susquehanna River since it was easier to run the rapids on the south side. However, the new canal — the Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal on the north side of the river — funneled the barge traffic into Port Deposit, stimulating rapid growth.

===Granite and bridges===

The first attempts to bridge the Susquehanna in Maryland were made by the Port Deposit Bridge Company, incorporated in 1808. Its attempts failed, so the Legislature in 1812 authorized another company to proceed. After completing a survey in 1813, which included the first written reference to Port Deposit, the company proposed a location that complied with the law but was longer than necessary. After petitioning for relief, the company was allowed to route the bridge closer to the falls, allowing it to be shorter. The Port Deposit Bridge, a wooden covered bridge, was built just north of Port Deposit during 1817 and 1818. Put into service in 1818, it was the earliest bridge crossing of the Susquehanna. Rebuilt after a span burned in 1823, it remained in service until 1857.
A site at the north end of Port Deposit was committed to quarrying &quot;granite.&quot; (actually gneiss) for bridges. The general area had been the site for granite quarrying before the bridge was constructed as there was use of this specific granite in buildings constructed before the Revolutionary War. This granite can be seen in many of the distinctive buildings in Port Deposit today.

Quarries were also opened here in 1829 by the proprietors of a competitor canal, the Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal, between Havre de Grace and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania, for canal construction projects routed along the opposite bank of the Susquehanna.

These quarries continued in service well into the 20th century. Port Deposit gneiss was used in:
* Many houses and five churches in Port Deposit
* Schools such as the U.S. Naval Academy, Haverford College and Catholic University of America
* Fort McHenry, Fort Delaware and Fort Carroll
* Public buildings like the Boston Public Library and the U.S. Treasury Building
* Public works such as the Concord Point Lighthouse, Lincoln Tunnel and the St Augustine seawall

===Incorporation===

Port Deposit was incorporated in 1824.

===Arrival of the railroad===

In 1832, the governments of Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania chartered a quartet of railroads to connect Baltimore and Philadelphia. The Maryland General Assembly chartered two railroads terminating at Port Deposit: the Baltimore and Port Deposite Rail Road Company to build a line from the Susquehanna&#x27;s western bank to Baltimore; and the Delaware and Maryland Rail Road Company to build from the river&#x27;s eastern bank to the Delaware state line. That same year, Delaware chartered the Wilmington and Susquehanna Rail Road Company to continue the line to Wilmington. In 1836, the D&amp;M merged with the W&amp;S to form the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad Company. On February 12, 1838, all three companies merged to form the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, forging a continuous line from Philadelphia to Baltimore. The main line passed southeast of Port Deposit; the town was connected by a branch line in 1866, running along the riverbank from Perryville. In 1881, the PW&amp;B came under the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). In 1893 the branch line was sold to the Columbia and Port Deposit Railway, also PRR-controlled.

===Jacob Tome===
Jacob Tome arrived in Port Deposit penniless; became a banker, philanthropist, and politician; and died one of the richest men in the United States. He was to become Cecil County&#x27;s first millionaire and its greatest philanthropist. The Tome mansion (built in 1850 but no longer standing) was the largest house in the town. In 1889, Tome founded the Jacob Tome School for Boys on Main Street, part of a system of schools called the Jacob Tome Institute. When he died on March 16, 1898, in Port Deposit, he left a substantial endowment for the institute, which the Tome School tapped to build a series of beaux arts granite buildings on the bluffs above Port Deposit, overlooking the Susquehanna River.

The CP-TOME interlocking on the railroad line through downtown Port Deposit is named in his honor.

===Damming the Susquehanna===
The Susquehanna River drops as it passes through the region above Port Deposit, as it cuts through the hard rock of the region. This characteristic, which had long been good for Port Deposit, also attracted power companies in the boom period after World War I. The Conowingo Dam, built in 1927, permanently changed the character of the town by terminating all river traffic and decimating what was left of the shad and herring fishery which was once found there. Port Deposit benefited from the dam as well; destructive accumulations of ice (referred to as ice gouges) no longer accumulated in the Conowingo Rapids or passed through Port Deposit, as it had to terrible effect in 1907.

===Other industry===
Formerly a major industry in Port Deposit, Wiley&#x27;s Manufacturing, fabricated the Fort McHenry Tunnel sections. They were floated and towed to the Baltimore construction site using tugboats. Construction was completed in 1985.

The immersed tubes of the 63rd Street Tunnel were fabricated at a shipyard in Port Deposit and then towed to New York City.

===National Register of Historic Places listing===

The entire town of Port Deposit was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places on May 23, 1978. Starting from Bainbridge Road on the south, the district extends about 1.4 miles north along US 222 to the quarry at the north end of town.

The town has several impressive older buildings, many built of the local granite or brick. The oldest structures in the historic district date from 1725, with the majority built from 1830 through the 1890s.

The town remained largely unspoiled by new construction until the late 20th century, since there was little room for construction. The bulk of the older buildings line the main street and the, until recently, single side street built in the narrow space between the bluffs and the river. The bluffs have been terraced and stairways lead between streets. Adams Hall, formerly part of the Tome Institute, became the Town Hall; the only remains of the Tome Institute&#x27;s former Washington Hall is the granite doorway that separates the Main Street from a parking lot today.

=== Police Department ===
During the second half of the twentieth century, Port Deposit maintained a small police department, mostly made up of parttime officers. Around 1966, the town council promoted Horace Boddy, one of the parttime patrolman, to chief of police. He had joined the force in the early 1960s, and with the command appointment he became the first African American police chief in Cecil County. In 1980, Chief Boddy stepped down from the commanding role. His next senior officer, Bill Waibel, became the chief as Boddy stayed on the force as a patrolman. He retired fully in 1983.

<text>Rising Sun is a town in Cecil County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,781 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The town which became known as Rising Sun was located in the disputed “Nottingham Lots” along the border between colonial Pennsylvania and Maryland. This area was claimed by William Penn and settled by Quakers in 1702 over the objection of Maryland. When Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon conducted a survey of the order in the 1760s, Rising Sun was found to be located in Maryland.

Around 1720, Henry Reynolds established a stone tavern on Nottingham Lot No. 17 to serve as a stage coach stop. According to local lore, he erected a sign over the entrance of the tavern depicting the rays of the sun at dawn and the words &quot;The Rising Sun&quot;. As the tavern was located along the route between Baltimore and Philadelphia, it became known as a meeting place for business, politics, elections, and other public activities. Local legend states that the tavern was more well known than the surrounding village (Summer Hill) so that by the time the town&#x27;s first post office was established around 1815, Rising Sun was chosen as the official name. There is some conjecture that the post office was located in the tavern.

When the town was incorporated in 1860, the commissioners had slate sidewalks installed, erected street lamps, and hired a lamplighter who doubled as bailiff and street maintenance man. Six years later the Philadelphia and Baltimore Central Railroad began to serve Rising Sun. Most of the town&#x27;s current structure has been built since then.

In 1895, a 24-year-old Rising Sun Man, Sailor John A. Kay, enlisted in the Navy. When the Battleship Maine sailed for Havana Harbor in January 1898, Kay was an assistant machinist on this voyage. He and about 268 crew members perished when an explosion ripped through the vessel on February 15, 1898. On Independence Day 1900, a tall, handsome monument was dedicated at the Brookview Cemetery, which sits on a hilltop at the edge of town.

In 1916 women voted in the Rising Sun municipal election for the first time. This was four years before the 19th Amendment to the Constitution passed, which provided voting privileges to women across the nation.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places at Rising Sun are: the Jeremiah Brown House and Mill Site, East Nottingham Friends Meetinghouse, Joshua Lowe House, Thomas Richards House, and West Nottingham Meetinghouse.

==Geography==
Rising Sun is located at (39.6994, -76.0630).
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Politics==
The current mayor is Travis Marion. The state senator for this area is Jason Gallion and the local delegates are Mike Griffith and Teresa Reilly.
Rising Sun is a largely conservative town, having voted Republican in every election since 2000. Approximately 60% of the population is registered Republican.

==Transportation==

Roads are the primary method of travel to and from Rising Sun. The most prominent highway serving Rising Sun directly is U.S. Route 1, which skims the northwest edge of town. Heading south, US 1 heads across the Conowingo Dam on its way towards Baltimore, while to the north, US 1 enters Pennsylvania on its journey towards Philadelphia. Other highways which pass through Rising Sun include Maryland Route 273 and Maryland Route 274. Maryland Route 276 passes just outside the town limits.

<doc id="116401" wikidata="Q753770" url="?curid=116401" title="Bryans Road, Maryland">
<text>Bryans Road is a census-designated place (CDP) in Charles County, Maryland, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 8,650.

Bryans Road was named after Oliver Norris Bryan, a 19th-century farmer and scientist who owned and operated Locust Grove Farm near Marshall Hall. The area consisted mostly of tobacco farms until the establishment of the Naval Proving Grounds at Indian Head in 1890. Some commercial establishments came about by the early 1920s, when the name &quot;Bryans Road&quot; first appeared on maps. The construction of Maryland Route 210 (Indian Head Highway) during World War II brought new traffic. By the early 1960s, Bryans Road became an established bedroom community for both Indian Head and Washington, D.C.

At the main intersection of Bryans Road, a shopping center includes a supermarket, various gas stations, and assorted retail stores that serves the community. Local residents commute to work at the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center, while others commute to employment centers throughout the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. In 1998, plans for a massive housing development project at Chapman&#x27;s Landing were thwarted by the Maryland state government, which bought the property to preserve green space under its smart growth policy.

Marshall Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and Mount Aventine was listed in the Register in 1996.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. The central part of the community is now dominated by a large water tower just behind the fire department. Maryland Airport, the only airport in Charles County, is located nearby in Pomonkey.

The Charles County Board of Commission commissioned a review to study the cross-county connector, a proposed road to link Maryland Route 5 south of Waldorf to Indian Head Highway in Bryans Road, to address traffic congestion along the Indian Head Highway (Maryland Route 210) corridor. However, plans to build the cross county connector fell dormant after objections from environmentalists and rejections for permits by the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Army Corps of Engineers. In October 2013, the Charles County Board of Commissioners decided to introduce a draft plan at a community meeting that featured a scaled-down plan for area improvements, including alternatives to the cross-county connector.

<doc id="116402" wikidata="Q753704" url="?curid=116402" title="Hughesville, Maryland">
<text>Hughesville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Charles County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,197 at the 2010 census. Truman&#x27;s Place was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.69%, is water.

Hughesville was a tobacco market town. The former tobacco warehouses are now used for second-hand thrift stores and boutique gift and craft shops.

Because Hughesville, though small, is considered the strategic geographic center of the tri-county Southern Maryland region, it houses institutions such as the headquarters for the Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative, an animal shelter, an economic development council, a board of realtors, and a homeless women&#x27;s shelter, which serve the tri-county area. There is also a Girl Scout camp. The town has no traditional grid-layout streets, but consists of merely businesses along the highway and some very small outlying housing developments. It was announced in 2013 that the College of Southern Maryland is building their fourth campus in the town.

A 5.5-MW solar farm near Hughesville generates enough power for 600 homes, and offsets the pollution of 1,600 cars.

<text>Indian Head is a town in Charles County, Maryland, United States. The population was 3,894 at the 2020 U.S. Census. It has been the site of a naval base specializing in gun and rocket propellants since 1890. Production of nitrocellulose and smokeless powder began at the Indian Head Powder Factory in 1900. The name of the base has varied over the years from Indian Head Proving Ground, to Naval Powder Factory, to Naval Propellant Plant, to Naval Ordnance Station, to the present Naval Support Facility Indian Head. The facility&#x27;s main tenant activity is the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC/IH). Advanced research in energetic systems takes place at NSWC/IH. NSWC/IH absorbed the function of the closed Naval Ordnance Laboratory, formerly in White Oak. The base currently employs 3,700 people.

==History==
The peninsula, a &quot;head&quot; of land overlooking the Potomac River, had been long occupied by various cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Algonquian-speaking Native American tribe was the Mattawoman (likely a band of the Piscataway) encountered by the first English settlers; the latter called the land &quot;Indian Head&quot;, meaning &quot;Indian Peninsula&quot;. According to research published by the historical society of Charles County, &quot;Indian Head&quot; is a shortened form of &quot;Indian Headlands&quot;. A newspaper article mentions another explanation of the name, that &quot;an unfortunate young brave&quot; from a foreign tribe was beheaded for falling in love with an &quot;Algonquin princess&quot;, although Edward W. Rice (the town&#x27;s mayor at that time) dismissed the story as a &quot;fairy tale&quot;.

===American Civil War===
During the American Civil War, Union Brigadier General Joseph Hooker commanded the Third Brigade near Budd&#x27;s Ferry in August 1861. The site was a gathering spot for volunteers, including the 5th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry under Colonel Samuel H. Starr. The site was also used by the Union Army Balloon Corps for reconnaissance of Confederate troop movements across the Potomac.

===Incorporation===
The town of Indian Head was incorporated in 1920. It is located between the Potomac River and Mattawoman Creek on Mattawoman/Cornwallis Neck, named for the 1654 grant of by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, to Capt. Thomas Cornwallis of St. Mary&#x27;s County. This land grant included the Cornwallis Manor on the Potomac, presumably the Indian Head site, with St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Manor of &quot;nearby but detached&quot;. The Town of Indian Head occupies land that was once part of the territory of the Algonquin Indians. The origin of the name Indian Head originates from the term &quot;Indian Headlands&quot;, as the entire lower end of the peninsula was occupied by Native Americans and was an Indian Reservation. The name Indian Head first appears in the Census of 1800. In 1850, the Washington Fruit Growers Association purchased a parcel of land, which included Indian Head and &quot;Glymont&quot;. Charles Pye offered for sale, a parcel of land (664 acres) known as Glymont, On December 2, 1834. The same 664 acres was put up for sale again on July 22, 1843, after the death of Charles Pye. The two tracts of land were purchased by The Glymont Improvement Company and recorded on March 20, 1887. The land (540 acres) was owned by B.D. Tubman and was known as &quot;Glymont&quot;. The second tract was called “Cornwallis Neck”, and was sometimes known as “Pye’s Wharf Estate”. It adjoined the lands of S. H. Cox and R. A. Chapman, the first-mentioned tract and others containing 480 acres of land, more or less. Glymont, with Pye&#x27;s Wharf and Leonard Marbury&#x27;s Wharf, were the largest river port in Charles County. The name &quot;Indian Head&quot; applies to the land west of Glymont.

During the Second World War, Indian Head thrived, with economic prosperity lasting until the late 1960s. The construction of the planned community of St. Charles, south of Waldorf, brought with it retail chains and big-box stores. This resulted in the downfall of Indian Head businesses as Indian Head residents began spending their income in St. Charles. 

Indian Head lacks many basic retail and service businesses. Many remedies for this situation have been attempted, but the desired growth has been slow in coming. Indian Head is bisected by Maryland Route 210, generally known as Indian Head Highway. It goes directly into the middle of town at the entrance to Indian Head Naval Support Facility. Because of this, the town cannot benefit from through-traffic, but must be a destination in its own right.

Private plans to build a massive &quot;Chapman&#x27;s Landing&quot; housing development a few miles to the north were thwarted in the 1990s when the state government purchased the land to preserve it as green space under its &quot;smart growth&quot; program. The preserved land includes an old growth Shell-Marl Ravine Forest ecosystem.

In 2004, the town opened a &quot;black box&quot; stage theater, the Indian Head Center for the Arts, and is exploring other efforts to revitalize the town. A section of the railroad to the naval facility, built in 1918, was converted to a 13-mile paved hiking/biking trail in 2008. A year-round swimming pool is at the nearby Henry E. Lackey High School. In 2018 the long-abandoned Elys&#x27; store was demolished, and a technology education center called the &quot;Velocity Center&quot; completed in 2020, linked to the Naval base (but with opening delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

The indigenous Piscataway Conoy Tribe of Maryland consider the name of the town offensive and have petitioned to have the name changed.

===Youngest mayor===
In 2015, Brandon Paulin was elected mayor of Indian Head. Brandon was 19 years of age when he was elected, making him the youngest mayor of any Maryland municipality in state history. As Vice Mayor, Kiran (Ron) Sitoula is the first Nepali to be elected to a public position outside of Nepal and the first non-US-born official in the history of the Town of Indian Head. Brandon was elected on May 5, 2015, and sworn into office on May 12, 2015.

<doc id="116404" wikidata="Q286925" url="?curid=116404" title="La Plata, Maryland">
<text>La Plata ( ) is a town in Charles County, Maryland, United States. The population was 10,159 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Charles County.

==History==
According to an unconfirmed local story, the town was named by one Colonel Samuel Chapman, whose family owned of land in Charles County. The Colonel traveled to South America with his son George, who had contracted tuberculosis, in search of a cure. In his travels, the Colonel had apparently encountered the Río de la Plata, which flows through Argentina and Uruguay, thus naming a portion of his property &quot;La Plata&quot;.

In the 1870s, a section of the Pennsylvania Railroad had been constructed through the town of La Plata, leading to its 1888 incorporation.

The La Plata courthouse had been built soon after the 1819 Port Tobacco courthouse caught fire in 1895 under suspicious circumstances. In 1904, the historic Christ Episcopal Church in Port Tobacco, which dates to 1683 and was reconstructed in 1884, was dismantled and its stones were then transported by oxen and cart to its current lot in La Plata.

In 1940, the opening of the then Potomac River Bridge (later, the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge), which carries U.S. Route 301 over the Potomac River, provided a link to King George, Virginia and brought long-distance east coast traffic through the town as an alternative to U.S. 1 and, later, Interstate 95. The bridge was replaced and widened in 2021.

===Tornadoes===
La Plata has been affected by multiple significant tornadoes in its history.

1926

On November 9, 1926, an F4 tornado killed 17 people, 14 of them in the La Plata Elementary School, which was destroyed.

1994

On July 27, 1994, two nonfatal twisters, that came only 11 minutes apart, went through the area. The first of them was rated F2 on the Fujita scale, which is already uncommon for Maryland.

2002&quot;&quot;

On April 28, 2002, another F4 tornado cut a swath through Charles County, with areas around La Plata damaged most severely. This tornado caused five deaths. Local officials credited federal- and state-assisted new construction efforts with helping them to remodel the downtown area following the tornado, as several new public buildings replaced some of those damaged there. A new La Plata Town Hall, for example, became Southern Maryland&#x27;s first LEED-certified building, and an old building considered historic by local residents, which housed a CVS Pharmacy store at the time of the tornado, was rebuilt in a new location after the storm. In the days after the tornado, help was provided by twenty-seven different jurisdictions, as well as the nearby Amish community in St. Mary&#x27;s County.

<text>Port Tobacco, officially Port Tobacco Village, is a town in Charles County, Maryland, United States. The population was 13 at the 2010 census, making Port Tobacco the smallest incorporated town in Maryland.

==Overview==
This was historically the territory of Algonquian-speaking peoples, especially the Potapoco and the more dominant Piscataway. Settled by the English in the 17th century and established in 1727, the town on the Port Tobacco River soon became the second largest in Maryland. The first county seat of Charles County, it was a seaport with access to the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean. It declined rapidly after river traffic was cut off by silting and the town was bypassed by the railroad. The town incorporated in 1888, but in 1895 the county seat moved to nearby La Plata, which drew population away but left the town with its historic significance intact.

Since the late 20th century, the former 1819 courthouse has been renovated for use as a historical museum. In 2007 a consortium started the Port Tobacco Archeology Project, devoted to revealing the history of Native Americans and colonial Europeans and Africans. Because of its unique history, the area is &quot;one of the richest archeological sites in Southern Maryland.&quot;

A few miles south, the St. Ignatius Church, manor house, and cemetery at St. Thomas Manor comprise a complex designated as a National Historic Landmark. It is notable as a Jesuit mission center established in the 17th century and is likely the oldest continuously operating Roman Catholic parish founded in the Thirteen Colonies. The complex at Chapel Point has scenic views overlooking the Potomac River. John Hanson, President of the U.S. Continental Congress, was born nearby.

===History===
Areas along the waterways of present-day Maryland were inhabited for thousands of years by various cultures of distinct indigenous peoples. At the time of European exploration, this coastal area along the Port Tobacco River was the territory of the Potapoco, an Algonquian-speaking tribe. They called their settlement Potapoco. Overall, the dominant tribe on the north side of the Potomac River was the Algonquian Piscataway tribe, which later absorbed some of the smaller tribes&#x27; survivors.

===Colonial era===
Within a generation of the first Maryland settlers&#x27; landing at St. Clement&#x27;s Island, they pushed the frontiers of the colony north and west toward the Potomac and Port Tobacco rivers. The English developed a small village about 1634 on the east side of the Port Tobacco tributary. It became the nucleus for trade and government. It was first called Chandlers Town. The town was one of the oldest English-speaking communities on the East Coast of the United States. In 1658, it was designated the first county seat of Charles County.

Later the English adapted the Potapoco name as Port Tobacco. Its name also referred to what became the colony&#x27;s chief export commodity crop. The town grew as it became a major port for the tobacco trade, with exports transported by ocean-going sailing ships. During the late 17th century, Port Tobacco became the second-largest river port in Maryland.

The early immigrants to Port Tobacco were products of the religious turmoil in England. Their deeply felt convictions were powerful influences in Maryland&#x27;s history. The area had both English Catholic and Church of England congregations. Father Andrew White of the Jesuits established a mission in 1641 and later a church at what became St. Thomas Manor at Chapel Point. The manor&#x27;s chapel was expanded to what is called St. Ignatius Church, a center for local Native Americans converted to Christianity. The oldest continuously operating Catholic parish in the United States, the complex has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and is part of the Religious Freedom Maryland Scenic Byways route. Catholic parish records identified Indian families through the decades, when civil records began to use only designations of free people of color, colored, or Negro for mixed-race persons, thus failing to record their cultural identification. The two state-recognized Piscataway-descendant tribes have used Catholic records in making their case for cultural continuity.

Freed from restraints by the Toleration Act of 1649 and feeling a need for spiritual guidance, some settlers gathered their first Anglican congregation in a log building at the head of the Port Tobacco Creek in 1683, nine years before the Establishment Act. Supported by the tobacco poll tax of 40 pounds per head from 1692 to 1776, Christ Church prospered. The community built a second structure in 1709. After the American Revolution, although the Anglican Church was disestablished in the US, parishioners rallied to contribute directly to Christ Church, and Lemuel Wilmer, of a distinguished family of Maryland Episcopalian clerics which included his brother William Holland Wilmer, uncle James Jones Wilmer, and father, grandfather and brother (all named Simon Wilmer) served as rector for 35 years. After a tornado destroyed the building in 1808, they held a lottery and ultimately financed a new brick structure, which was rededicated in 1827. Falling into disrepair after 60 years of use, it was demolished and replaced with a sandstone edifice in 1884. However, only the graveyard now remains of this church (and a relatively recently outline of the historic church&#x27;s foundation), since it was disassembled in 1904 and reassembled in La Plata, which had become the county seat in 1895. 

For two centuries, Port Tobacco area residents assumed important roles in state and national history. John Hanson was elected first President by the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation before moving to Frederick. Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer was a signer of the United States Constitution; and Thomas Stone was one of four of the Maryland delegation who signed the Declaration of Independence.
===Civil War===
During the Civil War, Port Tobacco became known as a stronghold of Confederate sympathizers, although Union troops occupied the town. Rose O&#x27;Neal Greenhow (1814–1864), born here, became renowned as a Confederate spy operating in Washington, DC. Recruited by former US Army captain Thomas Jordan, later promoted to Confederate general, she took over his network in early 1861. Due to military plans she passed to the Confederates that summer, she was credited with ensuring their victory at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861. Local slaves were freed following Maryland&#x27;s adoption of a new Constitution on November 1, 1864 (the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 did not apply to states which remained in the Union). During the hunt for John Wilkes Booth after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, intelligence gathered in a Port Tobacco hotel (Brawner Hotel) (conspirator George Atzerodt lived in town) established the assassin had fled with his companion Herold into Virginia, where they were ultimately located and Herold surrendered, but Booth died during the attempted capture.

===Decline===
Port Tobacco started declining as erosion from excessive agricultural use and poor soil conservation caused significant siltation at the head of the Port Tobacco River, decreasing its navigability and ultimately cutting off the town from access to Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Larger merchant vessels were unable to use the former seaport; as a result, commercial activity at the port had dwindled by the time of the Civil War.

The decline was exacerbated by the completion in 1873 of a nearby Baltimore and Potomac Railroad line to Pope&#x27;s Creek which bypassed Port Tobacco and ran further south to another port directly on the Potomac River. A small portion of the town&#x27;s square incorporated in 1888 as Port Tobacco Village, a move that may have signaled an effort by the community to reverse its decline, but new communities eventually sprang up along the railway and prospered, including the town of La Plata which succeeded Port Tobacco as the county seat in 1895.

==Reconstruction==
The remains today are identified as Port Tobacco Village. Because of the town&#x27;s abrupt decline and silting of the river, many archeological sites were preserved, making it one of the richest areas for studying the mixed history of Native and colonial cultures, including that of enslaved Africans. In 2007 the Port Tobacco Archeological Project began as a partnership among the Archaeological Society of Maryland, the Society for the Restoration of Port Tobacco, the Southern Maryland Heritage Area Consortium, Preservation Maryland, and Preserve America. It has encouraged participation by the community, with an Internet blog and regular chances for volunteer participation at many levels.

Visitors may see the reconstructed Port Tobacco Courthouse, furnished as it may have appeared in the 19th century, even as of the day of Booth&#x27;s escape. The North wing has exhibits on tobacco culture, as well as archaeological finds which reveal early colonial and Native American life.

Other notable nearby historic sites include:
* Several 18th-century homes on the National Register of Historic Places, including Rose Hill, Ellerslie, Linden, Retreat, Stagg Hall, and Catslide House.
* The restored one-room schoolhouse, used from 1876 to 1953
* Thomas Stone National Historic Site, the plantation home of one of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence.
* St. Thomas Manor and Cemetery at Chapel Point is the oldest continuously operating Catholic parish among the Thirteen Colonies; exhibits provide insight into early Catholic history and Jesuit missionary activity in the colony, as well as Native American history.
* Mulberry Grove, birthplace of John Hanson

== Port Tobacco folklore ==

===Legend of the Blue Dog===

Halloween reminds local residents of Charles County&#x27;s &quot;Blue Dog&quot; legend, which is taught in local schools and has been told in the county for more than 100 years. By most accounts, the spirit of a large blue dog protects the treasure of his murdered master, which is supposed to be buried somewhere along Rose Hill Road outside Port Tobacco.

Charles Stuart was the owner of the Rose Hill property containing the fabled rock where Blue Dog and his master were killed. He has said that the first written account of the Blue Dog legend dates back to 1897, when Olivia Floyd, a noted Confederate spy and owner of Rose Hill, told the &quot;Port Tobacco Times&quot; that she had seen the ghost of the Blue Dog.

The legend says that Charles Thomas Sims, a soldier, and his dog were killed on February 8 in the 18th century on Rose Hill Road while returning from a Port Tobacco tavern. This was following the American Revolutionary War. Henry Hanos of Port Tobacco purportedly killed Sims and his dog for Sims&#x27; gold and a deed to an estate. Hanos buried the gold and deed under a holly tree along Rose Hill Road. When Hanos returned to recover the treasure, he was scared away by the ghost of Blue Dog. Hanos fell ill and died suddenly. To this day, Blue Dog reportedly continues to watch over his slain master&#x27;s treasure.

Thuc Doan Nguyen is developing a film based on this tale.

In 1947, the residents of Potomac Heights formed a co-operative and purchased the entire community from the previous owners (the US government). It was built in 1940–1943 to provide housing for defense workers. Today, to obtain the right to occupy one of the co-op residences, one must first apply for and be accepted for membership in the co-operative. To gain acceptance one must meet the criteria established by voting members of the co-op.

Potomac Heights is one of many housing co-operatives in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, three of which were converted from government sponsored housing. The largest co-operative, Greenbelt, located in adjoining Prince George&#x27;s County, evolved from one of three planned communities (Greendale, Wisconsin, and Greenhills, Ohio) and developed as a federally supervised experiment in cooperative living under the New Deal during the Roosevelt administration. Hillwood Square Mutual in Falls Church, Virginia, was built to house workers at the Torpedo Factory in Alexandria.

<text>St. Charles is a planned community in Charles County, Maryland, United States. It is south-southeast of Washington, D.C., from northern Virginia and immediately south of Waldorf, which is the mailing address. (St. Charles comprises nearly all the population of Waldorf&#x27;s zip code 20602, and much of 20603).

When completed, St. Charles will comprise five villages — Smallwood and Westlake, which have been completed; Fairway, which is under development; and Piney Reach and Wooded Glen, which remain undeveloped. Each village has three to four neighborhoods. Residents in St. Charles have access to a variety of community amenities, including walking paths, swimming pools, scenic lakes, playgrounds and neighborhood centers. Many residents commute out of the county to work, including military residents who are stationed at Andrews Air Force Base, Bolling AFB, Patuxent River NAS, or the Pentagon. Many civilian residents are federal employees. St. Charles Towne Center is a 2-level regional shopping mall serving residents of a large four-county area. It opened in 1988 and was remodeled in 2007.

Many sections of St. Charles are still in development, including a retirement community for persons 60 years and older, and several themed restaurants west of U.S. Route 301. Hampshire, Lancaster, Dorchester, Sheffield, Heritage, Bannister, Wakefield, Huntington and Carrington are the already existing neighborhoods of St. Charles. In 2008, St. Charles Parkway was connected with Rosewick Road, providing a new alternative route to the county seat La Plata.

<text>Waldorf is a census-designated place in Charles County, Maryland, United States. Located south-southeast of Washington, D.C., Waldorf is part of Southern Maryland. Its population was 81,410 at the 2020 census. Waldorf has experienced dramatic growth, increasing its population 16-fold from fewer than 5,000 residents in 1980 to its current population. It is now the largest commercial and residential area in Southern Maryland as well as a major suburb in the Washington metropolitan area.

==History==
What is now the Waldorf area was originally part of the territory of the Piscataway Indian Nation, along with all of Southern Maryland, including Charles County. Close to the current western Waldorf area, the presence of villages, Indian grave sites (holding remains of over 1,000 people) and hunting encampments of Native American / Indian peoples have been confirmed, by archeological study of evidence dating from 1690 back to 6,000 years ago.

Europeans and African Americans first settled in the area in the 1600s. The town of Waldorf&#x27;s original name was Beantown at least as far back as the American Civil War. During his flight after assassinating Abraham Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth told a road sentry he was headed to his home in Charles County near Beantown and was allowed to proceed. Booth later received medical attention for his broken leg from Dr. Samuel A. Mudd at his home in Waldorf, before continuing his flight. In 1880, the General Assembly of Maryland by an act changed the name to &quot;Waldorf&quot; in honor of William Waldorf Astor (1848–1919), the great-grandson of John Jacob Astor (1763–1848), who was born in Walldorf, Palatinate, Germany. On July 29, 1908, the city of Plumb Valley in Waseca County, Minnesota, changed its name to Waldorf after Waldorf, Maryland.

Once a tobacco market village, Waldorf came to prominence in the 1950s as a gambling destination after slot machines were legalized in Charles County in 1949. The boom lasted until 1968, when gambling was once again outlawed. Its subsequent substantial growth as a residential community began with a 1970 loan package from the Department of Housing and Urban Development which fueled the giant planned community of St. Charles, south of Waldorf.

==Geography==

<text>Cambridge is a city in Dorchester County, Maryland, United States. The population was 13,096 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Dorchester County and the county&#x27;s largest municipality. Cambridge is the fourth most populous city in Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore region, after Salisbury, Elkton and Easton.

==History==
===Colonial era===

Settled by English colonists in 1684, Cambridge stands as one of the oldest colonial cities in Maryland. During the time of English colonization, the Algonquian-speaking Choptank Indians resided along the river bearing their name. Throughout the colonial years, English colonists developed farming on the Eastern Shore, with the largest plantations initially focusing on tobacco, before shifting to mixed farming. Enslaved people were purchased by the planters for labor in tobacco and mixed farming. Cambridge served as a regional trading center, with its town pier being a major hub for slave trading, a history extensively documented by historical markers scattered throughout the town center.

===National era===
Cambridge was officially incorporated in 1793, taking over part of the former Choptank Indian Reservation. The town received its name from a city and county in England. Cambridge also became a stop on the Underground Railroad, which provided a network of safe houses for enslaved people escaping to the north.

In the late 19th century, Cambridge developed food processing industries, specializing in the canning of oysters, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes. The town&#x27;s industrial growth was led by the Phillips Packing Company, which eventually became the region&#x27;s largest employer. Winning contracts from the Department of Defense during the First and Second World Wars greatly aided the company&#x27;s growth. At its height, the company employed as many as 10,000 workers. However, shifting tastes brought a decline in business, causing Phillips to reduce its operations. By the early 1960s, the company had ceased operations entirely, leading to widespread unemployment and exacerbating the city&#x27;s growing social issues.

===Cambridge movement===
From 1962 to 1967, Cambridge was a center of protests during the Civil Rights Movement, with local Black residents advocating for equal employment and housing opportunities, as well as the eradication of racial segregation in schools and other public facilities. Riots broke out in Cambridge in 1963 and 1967, prompting the deployment of the Maryland National Guard to the city to help maintain peace. The movement&#x27;s leader was Gloria Richardson, and with the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, public segregation in Cambridge officially ended.

===Present===
In 2002, the opening of the 400-room Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay resort provided a significant boost to the city&#x27;s economy through job creation and tourism. The resort features a golf course, spa, and marina, and has hosted numerous high-profile events, including the 2007 U.S. House Republican Conference, featuring an address by U.S. President George W. Bush, as well as subsequent visits by U.S. President Barack Obama.

Cambridge was designated a Maryland Main Street community on July 1, 2003. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development established Cambridge Main Street as a comprehensive downtown revitalization process with plans to enhance the economic potential of select cities across the state. This initiative has led to the improvement of heritage tourism attractions and, along with other cities on the Eastern Shore, has contributed to attracting more tourists to Cambridge. As a result, the downtown business district of Cambridge, part of which was declared a historic district in 1990, has undergone revitalization.

Four different teams in the old Eastern Shore Baseball Leaguethe Canners, Cardinals, Clippers, and Dodgerswere located in Cambridge.

The Brinsfield I Site, Cambridge Historic District, Wards I and III, Christ Episcopal Church and Cemetery, Dale&#x27;s Right, Dorchester County Courthouse and Jail, Glasgow, Goldsborough House, LaGrange, Annie Oakley House, Patricia (log canoe), Pine Street Neighborhood Historic District, Rock Methodist Episcopal Church, Stanley Institute, Sycamore Cottage, and Yarmouth are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

U.S. Route 50, a major east-west route of the U.S. Highway System, bisects Cambridge on its journey from Ocean City, Maryland to Sacramento, California. U.S. 50 is locally known as &quot;Ocean Gateway&quot;, with the segment running from the Choptank River to Cambridge&#x27;s eastern city limit designated &quot;Sunburst Highway&quot;.

The city had served as the western terminus of the railroad&#x27;s Seaford Line. The Maryland &amp; Delaware interchanges with the Delmarva Central Railroad at Seaford, Delaware, which interchanges with the Norfolk Southern Railway at Clayton, Delaware. The line remains in place, though rail service was suspended in May 2016 due to derailment issues along the line south of Hurlock, Maryland.

== Government ==

=== City Commission ===
Cambridge is governed by a mayor and a five-member city commission, who all serve four year terms.

In 2008, Victoria Jackson-Stanley was elected mayor, the first woman and the first African-American to hold the position. She would serve three terms before losing to Andrew Bradshaw in a runoff election in 2020.

Andrew Bradshaw was sworn in as the city&#x27;s youngest mayor on January 4, 2021, but was arrested on November 15 and charged with fifty counts of distributing revenge porn, allegedly posting explicit photos and captions to Reddit in April and May 2021, some which also included racial slurs. City Council President Lajan Cephas assumed the responsibilities of mayor following his arrest. On December 13, city commissioners unanimously voted to recommend that the city attorney remove Bradshaw from office. A special election to elect a new mayor was held on August 23, 2022. No candidate received the majority of the vote, forcing a runoff between the top two candidates on September 20, 2022. Former Cambridge commissioner Stephen Rideout won the runoff election with 55 percent of the vote and now is mayor.

==History==

The exact origins of Church Creek remain unclear. Popular tradition maintains that Church Creek predates Cambridge, Maryland as the earliest settlement in Dorchester County, and was first established at some point before 1684 under the name Dorchester Town and then White Haven. This has been disputed by historian Elias Jones, who found no indication of land sales in the area before 1700 in County Land Records.

Both the town and river of Church Creek derive their name from the nearby Episcopal church, now known as Old Trinity Church, built c. 1675. In 1867, Church Creek officially became the forty-second Incorporated town in Maryland, and remains one of the 123 such towns today. In 1975, the town adopted its first municipal tax in order to qualify for state tax grants and federal revenue-sharing.

===Economy===
The first major industry in Church Creek was shipbuilding, established at some point before 1767, which took advantage of surrounding forests plentiful with white oak and pine. As a result, the population of the town grew during the 18th and 19th centuries. The 1860 census recorded 218 families and 1,103, of which 51 percent were occupied as &quot;laborers&quot; and 26 percent occupied as &quot;farmers&quot;.

Toward the end of the 19th century, regional deforestation resulted in a downturn in the wooden shipbuilding industry. This adversely affected the industrial prosperity of Church Creek, and the population subsequently declined. The economy of Church Creek has historically benefited from human traffic due to the town&#x27;s location at the crossroads of Taylor&#x27;s Island Road (Route 16) and Church Creek-Golden Hill Road (Route 335). During the first half of the twentieth century, the residents of Church Creek maintained eight or nine general stores. But during the second half of the 20th century, the town&#x27;s economy and population continued to decline. According to the United States Census Records, the town contained 187 people in 1950, down to 115 in 1990.

===African-American education during Reconstruction===
Following the American Civil War, Church Creek was an early site for education of African Americans. The state passed the Public Instruction Act of 1865 to earmark public funds for the education of African-American students. But white-dominated Maryland county and city school boards refused to distribute the allocated money for the building and maintenance of African-American schools in the segregated system.

Instead, private organizations, such as the northern American Missionary Association, spearheaded the raising and allocation of money throughout Maryland. The fifth African-American county school was established in Church Creek on September 27, 1865 under the care of Mary S. Osbourne, with a total enrollment of thirty-two students. The County schools were quickly opposed by local residents, sometimes violently. In October and November 1865, arsonists destroyed African-American schools in Millington, Edesville, and Kent County.

Though the school at Church Creek was not attacked, it did encounter local antagonism. In December 1865, a group of Church Creek residents held an &quot;indignation meeting&quot; to organize and communicate their opposition to the African-American school and its teacher, Mary S. Osbourne. The Church Creek school for African-American students operated successfully throughout the 1865–66 school year. As teacher Mary S. Osbourne reported: &quot;One class of six knew the alphabet but could not read at all; now they read well, as far as First Step No. 12 on the Chart. … A class of seven read well in the First Reader, and are to commence Arithmetic at once. Another … [is] using the Third Reader and studying Geography.&quot; From 1861 to 1876 more than one-third of teachers in southern colored schools were African Americans, so it is likely that Osbourne was replaced by a southern African American teacher even during Reconstruction. In addition, one of every six teachers from the North were African American.

==History==
===18th century===
Long referred to as Newmarket, the town arose from its beginnings in the late 17th and early 18th centuries to be a social and commercial center serving the northern hinterland region of Dorchester County, Maryland into the early 20th century. It was an early locale for education. During the Great Awakening, Methodist preachers generated interest and created a majority of Methodist members in the region. They worked to convince slaveholders to free their slaves, and some did in this region. Changes in agriculture reduced the need for laborers. As a result, this area had one of the state&#x27;s largest free-black populations per capita. Before the war, Methodists in the North and South split over the issue of slavery. Southern Methodists had come to accept it and believed that Christianity could be applied to a system with paternal values of protection. The church split before the war, as Northern Methodists opposed slavery.

The town was active during the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War. The granaries of Col. James Sulivane (commissary officer during the American Revolutionary War) and a regiment of militia known as the &quot;New Market Blues&quot; were integral to the County&#x27;s as well as the colony&#x27;s/State&#x27;s efforts in the revolution.

The town is notable for an unusually broad span of architectural styles, most dating from the late 18th century through the early 20th century. The town&#x27;s history spans a period from the pre-Columbian to the modern.

Much of the Native American Indian remains are thought to be lost. The town was developed along the Nanticoke Indian path from the Choptank Indian &quot;Fort&quot;. It became a center of commercial crossroads of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, located on the main north-south route. The town had boarding houses, hotels and other such facilities to serve travelers and residents. The &quot;Bramble House,&quot; the &quot;Old Brick Hotel,&quot; and &quot;The Chesadale&quot; are three that served travelers for more than a century. Construction of a rail line increased travelers to the town, who got off at the depot on the east side.

The construction of the &quot;Governor Emerson C. Harrington Bridge&quot;, linking Easton to Cambridge and on to Salisbury, made the routes through East New Market secondary to the main flow of traffic. The opening of the bridge was attended by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who dedicated the structure.

Originally settled by colonists at what had become the juncture of several plantation, the town was named as &quot;New Market&quot;, as recorded in a land patent and resurvey granted by patent from the Lord proprietor&#x27;s land office to James Sulivane in May 1776, just prior to the issuance of the American Declaration of Independence. Some of the older grant names were &quot;York,&quot; &quot;Bath,&quot; &quot;Westward,&quot; &quot;Buckland,&quot; &quot;Buckland Regulated,&quot; &quot;Debate Enlarged,&quot; &quot;Melvill&#x27;s Meadow,&quot; &quot;Sulivane&#x27;s Meadow,&quot; &quot;Hooper&#x27;s Outlet,&quot; and &quot;Anderton&#x27;s Desire.&quot; At this point several of the more prominent families and their homes were located in the midst of what is now the town. Sulivane gained control of some early land grants by purchase, marriage and inheritance over a number of years. With these various parcels, Sulivane created a single tract for which the new survey or re-survey was granted.

In one section of the new resurvey, Sulivane changed the course of the road that constitutes the southern portion of the main street from its current intersection (Md. routes 14 and 16 ) to a subsequent bend and now fork in that road. On either side of this section, he platted a series of numbered lots and sold them off as building lots. The vacant lots ran from just south of what is now the intersection of Md. Routes 16 and 14 to a bend of the main street leading out of town and toward Cambridge. The oldest extant structure of European origins may date to the 1690s; it was added on to in the 1790s and became known as &quot;Temperance House&quot;, &quot;The Old Brick Hotel&quot;, &quot;Mitchell-Daffin House&quot;, or &quot;House of the Hinges&quot;.

&quot;Friendship Hall&quot; and &quot;Buckland&quot; have been dated to the mid-18th century. Early histories have erroneously ascribed all of the great early homes to the Sulivane family.

Such works as Jones&#x27;s &quot;History of Dorchester County&quot; and &quot;The Laskowski Papers&quot; have errors of attribution. 

The greater area was the home of Civil War-era and Union-sympathizer Maryland Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks. Hicks served in several different elected offices before being elected Governor of Maryland. He was one of the last nationally prominent Whig office holders. Later, he became a member of the American Nativist Party (sometimes known as the &quot;Know-Nothing Party&quot;), and served as governor and as a United States Senator during the last years of his life. He is considered integral to Maryland&#x27;s refusal to secede from the Union.

The town was established as early as 1783, when the State Legislature authorized the payment for a road &quot;... from the main road from Newmarket to Vienna to the grist-mill of Michael Hall Bonwill, and thence till it intersect the main road from Cambridge to Vienna.&quot; (&quot;Hanson&#x27;s Laws of Maryland 1763-1784,&quot; Volume 203, Page 361, 1783, CHAP. XIV). (By analogy, Dorchester County marks the year of its organization as 1668, not from a formal creation but from the date on a writ to sheriff of the County of Dorset.)

===19th century===
An 1803 state statute authorizes Newmarket to control certain ranging livestock. While this is not granting a town charter, the wording suggests there was a body of incorporated municipal leadership.

In 1805, the state legislature authorized the Levy Court for Dorchester County to appoint a bailiff for &quot;New-Market&quot;, specifying qualifications for the office and enumerating powers and jurisdiction.

In 1832, the first formal charter incorporating the town is found, incorporated under the name of &quot;East New Market&quot;. This by no means that this was the first incorporation but rather the first that can be found. Boundaries for the town were set at ½ mile as measured from an intersection of what was called LeCompte&#x27;s Tavern. Later, a reincorporation in 1860 reduced the limits to ⅓ of a mile but still measured from &quot;...the tavern house known as &quot; James Lecompte&#x27;s&quot; or the &quot; frame tavern&quot; each way;...&quot;

The idea of tracing the town&#x27;s incorporation date is not dissimilar from Dorchester County itself, which traces its establishment from 1668 and the issuance of a writ from the Governor&#x27;s council to the Sheriff of Dorsett. The formal setting-aside of the county has been lost.

The appellation &quot;East&quot; had been added in 1803 with the establishment of a post office. The change was made by the United States Postal Service to distinguish it from the town of New Market in Frederick County, and areas of Baltimore, Kent, and Talbot Counties Maryland as well as from several other areas up and down the Atlantic seaboard. Among most longtime residents, the emphasis upon the pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name is on the word New, perhaps reflecting the pronunciation of the original name.

A committed forward-thinking leadership remained active over the expanse of time. By the outbreak of World War I, the town already had its first bank, electric company, water company, and fire brigade. It had its own sanitary sewer system by the 1930s.

With a congregation dating back to the period prior to the &quot;Christmas Conference of 1784&quot;, what is currently believed to have been the first Methodist meeting house in the town was established in 1810 and known as &quot;Union Chapel&quot;. Francis Asbury, 1st Bishop of the American Methodist (Episcopal) Church, held quarterly conferences there and noted in his journal enemy activity locally during the War of 1812. The chapel was built with an adjoining graveyard. A Greek revival structure was built circa 1848 at new location in the town and named &quot;Trinity&quot; replacing &quot;Union Chapel&quot; and with a separate cemetery on the town&#x27;s outskirts established which some have come to believe was inspired by the &quot;Cemetery Movement&quot; of the period.

Members of the Methodist movement had, from early on met in various places ranging from the homes of members to meeting houses provided for their use. From such a congregation, meeting in the home of one &quot;Brother Ayers,&quot; the congregation gave rise to the seat of the Dorchester Circuit when it was formally created in 1804. From that circuit various circuits were later carved but records, as was customary church practice, always remained with the church that sat as the seat of the circuit. In this case seat of The Dorchester Circuit was with the congregation in New Market with its place of worship at Union Chapel and its later successor Trinity. Thus it is in effect the &quot;mother circuit&quot; to all others set off from the Dorchester Circuit.

Union Chapel is the first known structure of the Methodist congregation in East New Market being built around 1810. It is believed to have been a frame structure with an attendant burial ground and sat on what is known in the 20th century as School or Academy Street, i.e. Md. State Rt. 14 and Creamery Road. This structure served the congregation in the 1840s when a series of events marked a major shift in the church&#x27;s and the local congregation&#x27;s status.

In 1844, the split within the Methodist Church in the United States took place over the issue over the issue of slavery at its General Conference. Between 1845 and 1848 land was donated by the Hicks family for a new church which resulted in the construction of what became known as Trinity Church (cornerstone bearing date 1848). Trinity Church is a rectangular structure in a modest Greek revival style featuring a prominent oversized corner pilasters and a central pavilion from which a shingled steeple sharply rises. The older &quot;Union Chapel&quot; structure was sold to the existing Episcopalian congregation of what became known as St. Stephan&#x27;s Church as verified by both the land records of Dorchester County and the short history of St. Stephan&#x27;s written by one of its rectors Father Robert English.

Within the same time frame land was donated to the Trustees of Trinity for the construction of a parsonage. that parcel and subsequent structure were located on the east side of the main street near its southern end remained the parsonage until the early 1960s when a new brick structure adjacent to the church replace it. The original parsonage from the 1840s is still standing as of this writing. At the time of the construction of the new parsonage a dilemma arose over the disposal of the older structure and lot as it was subject to a reversionary clause in its granting deed requiring that the gifted land always be used for the purpose of a parsonage but to revert to the original grantors, their heirs or assignees if the land ceased to be used for that purpose. A lawsuit was required to resolve the issue as no heirs of the original grantors could be found.

A third development in the same time period occurred when land for a new cemetery was conveyed to the Trustees of Trinity Methodist Church. The new location was just outside the official town boundaries to the southwest on the main road of what is now known as Maryland Rt. 16. This parcel was part of a farm and was conveyed to the trustees by Thomas K. Smith. Thus the continued use of the older burial ground of their former location at &quot;Union Chapel&quot; was no longer needed; it coincides with a more general trend known the rise of the cemetery movement (for a general discussion of the topic of the cemetery movement see the book &quot;Lincoln at Gettysburg&quot; by historian Garry Wills)

The Greek revival structure was, by oral tradition, greatly altered on the interior when a major wing was added ca. 1912. Supposedly a balcony was removed, new stained glass windows and a wing known as the &quot;Sunday School&quot; wing was added, and coal oil lamps replaced. A pressed tin ceiling and wall covering above beaded tongue and groove wainscoting installed, and a split chancel rail floor plan adopted and choir box added. The original exterior design remained fundamentally unaltered and the new wing continued the Greek revival look of the original. A series of vastly oversized folding panel doors separated the wing from the main sanctuary. However, over time, due to the lack of a solid foundation footing, the great weight of the doors and the settling of the area where the original sanctuary and south wall of the wing met, the doors ceased to be able to open or retract and resulted in their being removed, leaving a large squared arch opening between the sanctuary and the wing.

In addition to the Methodist denomination, an Anglican Chapel was known to have been built in 1791 under the auspices of James Sulivane. The original chapel and graveyard established by the Methodist congregation continued to be used by the local Episcopal congregation as its second location until the building of its third and current church, St. Stephen&#x27;s Church, in 1893 on the northern end of the town&#x27;s main street. The &#x27;Methodist Protestant Church,&#x27; &#x27;Baptist Church&#x27; &#x27;German Evangelical and Reformed Church&quot;, and &#x27;Lutheran Church, have also served in the community.

Various types of schools and academies serve the community and a far wider reach than might be imagined for a town whose core population remained relatively stable for close to two centuries. The earliest school was chartered by the state in 1818, and others, public and private, male and female, white and black followed. The two main schools came about in 1878-80 and in 1912.

On February 6, 1819, the New-Market Academy was incorporated. Five days later, the law providing for the free public school system in Dorchester County was passed and naming the commissioners for the same. In 1829, the state legislature provided for an annual payment of $200 to the academy, and the academy was reincorporated in 1830. An additional statute made it clear that the annual allocation for the New Market Academy was not to be considered as part of the funding for the free school system. These respective acts were passed under the governorships of Charles Goldsborough, native to Dorchester County, and Thomas King Carroll, who had strong family ties with the county. In 1850, the Newmarket Academy and the county free schools were joined by the East New Market Female Seminary.

In a series of articles published in the weekly newspaper &quot;Democrat and News&quot; (D. &amp; N.), the basic origins of the third school built in East New Market can be followed. The articles are in effect the minutes of the Dorchester County School Board that were published subsequent to the board&#x27;s meetings and appear to be reprinted in whole without comment or editing by the newspaper itself.

===20th century===
At the February 14, 1912, meeting of the board (as reported in the minutes published on the 16th in the “D. &amp; N.”), two residents of the town identified in the minutes only as Messers Demott and Clifton appeared complaining of sanitary conditions. They urged the construction of a new school for the “accommodation and comfort” of the community.

It appears that at the time the board appointed from the respective communities members of the local citizenry to positions that oversaw the schools within the community in the event there were needs or problems. These appointees were referred to as trustees and reported to the members of the board. It is not entirely clear whether Messers and Demott and Clifton were in fact the referenced trustees. As the Secretary to the board was instructed to interview the trustees and report back, it seems reasonable to infer that they were not. At the same meeting, it is made clear that should a new school be in fact needed that a bond would have to be authorized by the state legislature as the board itself had no independent funds for such an undertaking.

By the April 23, 1912, meeting, the state legislature had in fact passed the authorization for a $10,000 bond but the Board had not issued them. “A delegation composed of Messers William E. Johnson, Frederick Wright, Charles Meyers, Samuel J. T. Smith, and Otis Bramble from East New Market was present and requested the Board take action...” which they the proceed to do per the May 3 issue of the “D. &amp; N.” in that very session. The May 21 was set for the deadline for bids.

Six bids were received and opened by the building committee as reported in the June 14 issue in the “D. &amp; N.” with bids ranging from a high bid of $12,990.oo from Daniel Harding, Baltimore to a low of $9,996.oo from A. O. German, of Hurlock. The building committee did not award the contracts deciding instead to consult with the project architect one Mr. Charles G. Fisher of Milford, Delaware.

Two items appear in the D.&amp; N.’s July 19 report of the July 16 meeting. First, the final award of the contract was announced apparently after some negotiating to A. O. German, the successful bid being some $526.00 less than the original bid reported in the June 14 issue. Second, the school board approved the payment to S. J. T. Smith [Samuel J. T. Smith]&#x27; of $150.00 for having Mr. LeRoy Lankford move the old East New Market School. Payment of $150.oo to W. E. Johnson, president of the building committee, to the order of the project architect was also ordered. The late O.W. &quot;Bill Hubbard&quot; recalled in a conversation with local historian Kirk L. Hurley that he had seen a frame structure hauled on a jacked up flatbed with wheels across what was then and remains an open field to the location of what is now St. Stephen Episcopal Church. Hubbard was and remained until death a communicant of that church.

A point of confusion arises here per a conversation with the late Reuben Clauser from the 1960s. In that conversation also with Hurley, Mr. Clauser recalled being chased around the old school building in a game of tag during which he ran into the scaffolding surrounding the new brick structure. The question arises as to whether there was a delay in the moving of the school or some other explanation. It remains unanswered at this point but seems likely as the need for a school, pending completion of new construction, would remain.

The last public high school in the town ceased operation when it was merged in 1954 with the school population of two other rural high schools (Hurlock High School, and Vienna High School) to form North Dorchester High School under its first Principal, Charles F. Hurley, Sr. The elementary school was merged in the late 1970s with that of the adjoining town of Secretary in that town.

It is immediately evident from these recitations that this community was one of prosperity with a forward thinking population. Among the most progressive of these was C. Edwin Bell (Cyrus Edwin Bell) who, after the &quot;great fire&quot; of 1914, persuaded the town to build its own water system. Fresh potable water was and is drawn from aquifers and delivered to each home and business. A system of fire hydrants was also installed. The efforts at the last quarter of the 20th century to revamp the system saw that the pipes had been placed at a death that even modern the road reconstruction of the early 1960s and subsequent traffic had not disturbed them and that provision had been made at the initial installation of the system, off of each major line, for expansion of the system concomitant to the hoped for and expected town&#x27;s growth in population when it came.

The supposition that the retention of such a major number of old buildings in whole or in part dating in some cases as far back as the latter part of the seventeenth century was due wholly or significantly to the lack of financial resources and economic prospects of the community is correct only due to many factors such as the severe and lasting effect of the economic collapse suffered by the United States in general during the Great Depression. The failure of the steam ship lines (which had by the 1920s and 1930s been acquired by the railroads) came at a time when there were insufficient resources, public or private, to maintain them). Subsequently, the decline and loss of profitability by the railroads marked a period in which the entire region of the Eastern Shore of Maryland fell into decline and obscurity. For such a small town to have achieved and maintained so much is truly remarkable. Only the county seat of Cambridge with a population vastly larger by comparison could boast so many municipal achievements so early for so long.

In 1880, four years after the nation&#x27;s centennial, the town&#x27;s population stood at 242 with no comparable data from the 1870 census. With East New Market and Cambridge as the only two communities set out in the census report, the picture of a rural agrarian and aqua-cultural county is complete. The report notes that the election district had a total population of 2498. This represented an increase in the districts&#x27; total population by 151. This is remarkable when noting that a significant portion of the district was lost prior to the census due to the creation of the 14th or Linkwood Election District.

Population counts for the town showed 1,267 in 1900 (all statistics per U.S. Census Bureau as reported by minor civil division per respective census.). By comparison the population of the village of Secretary was 410. There were 721 persons in the East New Market election district living outside the town limits. The village of Hurlock, which had by 1900 been made part of the new 15th election district subsequent to the 1890 census, had a population of 280. In 1910 the election district&#x27;s total population was 2,068 with the town proper showing a decrease in population to 880 and Secretary&#x27;s at 409. Hurlock had grown to 516. In 1920, the total for the district had reached 2008 without breaking down the totals for the town of East New Market nor the Village of Secretary. By 1930, the entire East New Market Election district had a total population of 1,800 of which 940 are noted as rural farm population. No separate town figures are shown.

===21st century===
This decline in population over the past century reflects the national trends as shown the same respective census reports of declines in family sizes and the shift of the population to a more urbanized society with its concomitant economic offerings and social advantages. That in combination with the effects of a World War, the economic devastation and the resulting isolation of what had been a thriving economic community and other factors saw the decline ensue. The Town of East New Market&#x27;s total was 153 at the 1990 census, and 167 at the 2000 census.

The 2005 population estimate is 245. This estimate is based on the projected relocation of retirees from the northeastern and other sections of the United States for purposes of retirement. In 2007 and 2008, a period of economic decline for the nation and region in general, construction has outstripped any total that has occurred in the combined near half century in total.

<text>Vienna is a town in Dorchester County, Maryland, United States. The population was 271 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Prior to European colonization, a Nanticoke town called &quot;Chicacone&quot; existed where Vienna is now located. The Nanticokes are an Algonquian people. Chicacone was the largest Nanticoke settlement at the time of John Smith&#x27;s exploration of the Chesapeake Bay in 1608. By 1742, ongoing violations of Indian reservation rights by English colonizers caused the Nanticoke people to abandon Chicacone. In 1768–69, the Colony of Maryland dissolved the Nanticoke reservation. Many of the Nanticokes of Chicacone migrated north to Pennsylvania, New York, and Canada, while others stayed and assimilated into the white or black communities of lower Dorchester and Wicomico counties.

Vienna was founded in 1706. It thrived on trade, shipbuilding and tobacco farming. The wreck of a 45-foot cargo ship that was likely built at a small shipyard or plantation in Maryland was found in 2015 under the US 50 Bridge over the Nanticoke River. Charring suggests it was torched by British sympathizers in the 1780s. The British raided the town repeatedly during the American Revolutionary War, and again during the War of 1812. This led to the building of a wall across the city&#x27;s waterfront on the Nanticoke River. This wall is in ruins today. Handsell was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

Vienna was incorporated in 1833.

<doc id="116420" wikidata="Q754993" url="?curid=116420" title="Braddock Heights, Maryland">
<text>Braddock Heights is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Frederick County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,608 at the 2010 census. The local ZIP codes are 21714 (post office boxes only) and 21703.

==History==
Braddock Heights is located at an elevation of atop Braddock Mountain (as Catoctin Mountain is locally known) near the pass at Braddock Springs, so named after British General Edward Braddock and Lt. Colonel George Washington&#x27;s use of the mountain pass on their way to Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War on April 29, 1755. During the Civil War, Braddock Heights was the site of a minor cavalry battle between generals J.E.B. Stuart (CSA) and Alfred Pleasonton (USA) on September 13, 1862; it was at that time known as &quot;Fairview Pass&quot;. One mile east of Braddock Heights, near the base of Braddock Mountain, are the older communities of Clifton and Old Braddock.

The picturesque view of the city of Frederick from Old Braddock, also known as &quot;Fairview&quot;, elevation , was the inspiration for Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. to record in his 1862 journal:

This journal entry was in turn an inspiration for Holmes&#x27; close friend John Greenleaf Whittier when composing the famous Civil War poem &quot;Barbara Fritchie&quot;.

Braddock Pass is near the locations at which Interstate 70 and the National Pike (U.S. Route 40) cross Catoctin Mountain. Braddock Heights was founded in 1896 by George William Smith as a summer resort community that eventually included several hotels, a community pool, a wooden-floor skating rink, an amusement park, scenic overlooks, nature trails, and until 1980, a small ski resort. Braddock Heights has been host to many national political figures, including Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Edwin Warfield, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Earl Warren, Ethel Kennedy, and (then) Senator Richard Nixon.

Braddock Heights was one of the first modern planned communities in the United States, and custom housing development has continued since 1901. Braddock Heights is now known for its eclectic houses and its views of Frederick and the Monocacy and Middletown valleys. Following the end of World War II, and the decline of the amusement park, Braddock Heights&#x27; demographic changed from commercial summer boarding houses to that of an unincorporated community with permanent residents.

Braddock Heights, similar to the other Maryland cottage parks of Pen Mar and Glen Echo, has evolved into an artisans&#x27; community. The Braddock Heights Community Association and the Braddock Heights Historical Society continue to maintain and hold public events at Braddock Heights Park.

Braddock Heights was once home to the oldest roller rink in the United States, the Stargaze Skateway. It burned to the ground as the result of arson on August 18, 1998.

Braddock Heights is said to be the roost of the Snallygaster, a chimeric bird-like creature claimed to be responsible for the disappearance of livestock, and the occasional Middletown Valley resident, since the mid-18th century.

===Hagerstown &amp; Frederick Railway===
The Hagerstown &amp; Frederick Railway, a suburban and interurban trolley system, was developed by George William Smith and initially called the Frederick and Middletown Railway. Service between Frederick and Braddock Heights commenced on August 22, 1896. The Jefferson branch was added in 1906, running down the east side of Jefferson Boulevard. The right of way is still visible as a strip between the set-back sidewalk and the street.

Service to Jefferson lasted until 1940, although a short section was kept open to serve the Vindobona Hotel. Service to Braddock Heights and Middletown from Frederick was finally discontinued in 1946.

==Geography==
Braddock Heights is located in west-central Frederick County along the ridgecrest of Catoctin Mountain, known locally as &quot;Braddock Mountain&quot;. U.S. Route 40 Alternate crosses the mountain near the center of the community, leading east to Frederick and west to Middletown. Interstate 70 crosses the northern part of the CDP, with access from partial Exit 49 (U.S. Route 40 Alt.) at the east base of the mountain. U.S. Route 40 forms the northern edge of the CDP.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Braddock Heights CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.23%, is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 4,627 people, 1,684 households, and 1,343 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 1,733 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 96.17% White, 1.19% African American, 1.02% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 0.35% from other races, and 1.25% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.73% of the population.

<text>Brunswick is a city in southwestern Frederick County, Maryland, United States. The city is located on the north bank of the Potomac River; Loudoun County, Virginia occupies the opposite shore. The population of Brunswick was 8,211 at the 2022 Census. There are three schools serving Brunswick: Brunswick Elementary School, Brunswick Middle School, and Brunswick High School.

== History ==

The area now known as Brunswick was originally home to the Susquehanna Native American tribe. In 1728 the first settlement was built, and the region became known as Eel Town, because the natives would fish for eel in the Potomac River. A grant to the land was then given to John Hawkins by George II of Great Britain on August 10, 1753. The grant had the name &quot;Hawkins Merry-Peep-o-Day&quot;.

The land was sold and Leonard Smith platted it in 1787 with the name of “Berlin,” as many Germans settled in the area. The name “Berlin,” however, could not be used for mail as there was already a Berlin on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, so the post office changed the name to &quot;Barry.&quot; The town continued to grow and was incorporated April 18, 1890 with the name “Brunswick.”

Established along the now-defunct Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, the city became a hub for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which built a six-mile-long rail yard along the Potomac from 1891 to 1912, boosting the population to over 5,000, and making Brunswick virtually a company town. The railroad reduced its yard operations in the 1950s.

During Patsy Cline&#x27;s early career, she performed at the Moose Lodge in Brunswick where she met her first husband, Gerald Cline.

Today Brunswick is home to a commuter rail station serving Washington, D.C. It is home of the Brunswick Heritage Museum which interprets the history of the city and is home of a large model railroad showing why the city&#x27;s location was important to the railroad. Brunswick High School named their mascot the &quot;railroaders&quot; 

Since the early 20th century, the unofficial slogan of the town referred to by locals has been &quot;Hills, whores and liquor stores.&quot; However, several elements of new migration to Brunswick have campaigned to change the slogan to &quot;Hills, stores and open doors,&quot; which has been met with much criticism from native residents.

== Tourism ==
The largest citywide event is &quot;Railroad Days&quot; on the first weekend in October, a festival celebrating the city&#x27;s heritage. Another major annual event is the Veterans Day Parade, which has taken place each year since 1932. Other events year round include the Wine and Chocolate Walk in September, Farmers&#x27; Market, Arts In The Parks, Little League opening day, and other city and museum events.

The city markets its historic downtown and its access to recreational activities on the C&amp;O Canal and Potomac River. The city&#x27;s history is preserved in the Brunswick Heritage Museum (formerly the Brunswick Railroad Museum), established in 1974. The historic commercial district of the city along Potomac Street features a bike shop, antique stores, restaurants, a brewpub, a yoga studio, a martial arts studio, a convenience store, and a sporting goods store. There are live music performances many nights of the week at Beans in the Belfry, a café located in the restored former First Evangelical and Reformed Church (built in 1910).

<text>Burkittsville is a historic village in Frederick County, Maryland, United States. The village lies in the southern Middletown Valley along the eastern base of South Mountain.

Burkittsville is a residential area with an economy based in agriculture and tourism. The village was the scene of the Battle of Crampton&#x27;s Gap, part of the Battle of South Mountain during the Maryland Campaign of the Civil War on September 14, 1862. Burkittsville was also made a subject of national attention when it was used as the setting of the 1999 horror film &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. Nearby attractions include the Gathland State Park and the Appalachian Trail. A Gravity hill also exists nearby on Gapland road.

The population was 142 as of the 2020 census.

==History==

English settlement in this region began in the early 18th century. Land was being surveyed and patented in the south-western portion of the Middletown Valley beginning in the 1720s. The first land tract to be patented within the present boundaries of Burkittsville was &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Purchase&quot;, dated May 14, 1741. The Harley/Arnold Farm, located on the western border of the village at the base of South Mountain, stands on the &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Purchase&quot; tract.

Burkittsville was first founded by two property owners: Major Joshua Harley and Henry Burkitt. The western half was first founded as &quot;Harley&#x27;s Post Office&quot; in 1824. After Harley&#x27;s passing in 1828, Burkitt renamed it Burkittsville. Over the next thirty years it grew as a community with stores, shops, blacksmiths, a schoolhouse, and a tannery.

On September 13, 1862, Confederate cavalry under command of Colonel Thomas Munford (under General J.E.B. Stuart) occupied Burkittsville. On Sunday, September 14, the forces of the Union and Confederate armies engaged in the Battle of Crampton&#x27;s Gap, a bloody prelude to the Battle of Antietam. The Reformed and Lutheran churches and adjacent schoolhouse were used as hospitals for the more than 300 wounded of both sides. These buildings still stand today.

Routinely characterized as the trigger to Antietam, victory at Crampton&#x27;s Gap embodied Union Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s strategic reaction to his acquiring the legendary “Lost Order” at Frederick which disclosed Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s campaign movements. It was McClellan&#x27;s intention to “cut the enemy in two and beat him in detail”.
After seizing Crampton&#x27;s Gap Gen. William B. Franklin failed to relieve the besieged Union garrison at Harpers Ferry, and more importantly to prevent Confederate generals James Longstreet and “Stonewall” Jackson from reuniting at Sharpsburg. There Lee hastily stood his ground in the mammoth battle of Antietam, the war&#x27;s bloodiest day. President Abraham Lincoln then used the marginal Union victory at Antietam as a springboard to his Emancipation Proclamation which changed war aims. Without the fall of Crampton&#x27;s Gap there would have been no Antietam.

Nearly all of Burkittsville is a historic district, listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 1975. The district includes about 70 contributing structures. The Burkittsville Historic District is itself part of the larger Crampton&#x27;s Gap Historic District, which comprises the southern portion of the lands involved in the Battle of South Mountain, extending from the western side of Crampton&#x27;s Gap, over South Mountain and about a mile to the east of Burkittsville.

<text>Emmitsburg is a town in Frederick County, Maryland, United States, south of the Mason-Dixon line separating Maryland from Pennsylvania.

Founded in 1785, Emmitsburg is the home of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University. The town has two Catholic pilgrimage sites: the National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, which is on the campus of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s, and the Basilica and National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, who was the first native-born United States citizen to be canonized as a saint. The Seton Shrine is one of the top eight Catholic pilgrimage destinations in the United States.

The National Emergency Training Center (NETC) campus is in Emmitsburg, located on the former campus of Saint Joseph College. The campus includes the Emergency Management Institute, the National Fire Academy and the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial.

The population as of the 2020 United States Census was 2,776.

Emmitsburg is home to three Cal Ripken Baseball 12U 46/60 baseball championships. The titles were won in consecutive years (2013, 2014, and 2015). 
The current mayor of Emmitsburg is Frank Davis. The current commissioners are Amy Boehman-Pollitt, Jim Hoover, Valerie Turnquist, Kevin Hagan, and Cliff Sweeney.

==History==
Emmitsburg was named for its founder, William Emmit, in 1785. However, a settlement (named first &quot;Silver Fancy&quot; and later &quot;Poplar Fields&quot;) preceded the town, particularly since British authorities restricted colonists&#x27; expansion during and after the French and Indian War.

In 1757 Lutherans led by pastor George Bager built a church, which they shared with a German Reformed congregation until 1798. After the American Revolutionary War, Catholic missionary Rev. Jean Dubois established a mission church, then a seminary, at Emmitsburg. Later Elizabeth Ann Seton established a convent, with a school and hospital. Soon, the number of Methodists in Emmitsburg led to the formation of a circuit around town, rather than share a minister with Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

The Union fortified Emmitsburg to stop the Confederate invasion of the Union territory in June 1863 during the American Civil War. Half the town was burned to the ground in a mysterious fire on the night of June 23. Folklore has it that &quot;The Great Fire&quot;, as it was known, was started by a Union sympathizer to prevent advancing Confederates from taking supplies from the town. However fate spared the town a battle between the opposing forces, which instead took place 12 miles north of it in Pennsylvania near the town of Gettysburg. The town was briefly held by the retreating Confederates on July 4.

<doc id="116428" wikidata="Q756107" url="?curid=116428" title="Middletown, Maryland">
<text>Middletown is a town in Frederick County, Maryland, United States. The population was 4,136 as of the 2010 census. Located in the Middletown Valley that stretches between the Catoctin Mountains on the east and South Mountain on the west, the town reportedly gained its name from its location midway between those ranges.

==History==
A young Lieutenant George Washington, while surveying the South Mountain area, reported that Middletown Valley was one of the most beautiful places he had ever seen. Later, as a colonel in 1755, he was to accompany General Braddock on the old Indian Trail that ran through the valley on his way to Fort Cumberland.

The early German and English settlers started to arrive in the valley in the 1730s. Among them was Michael Jesserong, who paid £66 for . He named his property Middletown and sold the first lots there in 1767, the date officially marked as that of the town&#x27;s founding.

Main Street spread to the west with construction of the National Pike through the town in 1806; the telegraph lines from Frederick to Hagerstown were routed through Middletown in 1854; and in 1896, car 11 of the Frederick Middletown Railway made its first run to Middletown. During the Civil War, both armies passed through the town to the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. In the aftermath of those battles, Middletown opened its churches and homes to care for the wounded.

Middletown preserves many historic structures indicative of its various periods of development and prosperity. The core of the old town, comprising the several blocks along West Main Street (US Route 40 Alt) and South Church Street (MD Route 17) contains several examples of Federal and Greek Revival architecture, including the Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church (1859–1860) and Christ Reformed Church United Church of Christ (1818). With the coming of the Hagerstown and Frederick Railway in the 1890s, the town expanded to the east, where several examples of various Victorian-era styles can be seen, including Queen Anne, Gothic Revival, and later examples of Colonial Revival styles. The economic prosperity experienced in the town during the first quarter of the twentieth century led to the alteration of older commercial structures and the construction of new ones in the first few blocks of Main Street, including the Beaux-Arts styled Valley Savings Bank (today the Middletown Valley Bank). Many of these structures are registered in the Middletown Historic District.

==Geography==

<text>New Market is a town in Frederick County, Maryland, United States. The population was 1,525 at the 2020 census. The town bills itself as the &quot;Antiques capital of Maryland&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
When Frederick, Maryland, began being settled in 1745, trade routes between Frederick and Baltimore emerged. Present-day New Market developed along this road, which later was improved. It became known as the National Road and the Gateway to the West. In 1926, U.S. Route 40, a major coast-to-coast highway, was constructed and designated along the former National Road.

To accommodate travelers along this important colonial road, Nicholas Hall tried to plat the town of New Market in 1788. He likely had disputes with William Plummer, an owner of adjoining land and was unable to complete the project. On August 1, 1792, William Plummer laid out 36 lots for the town. Later, on January 29, 1793, Nicholas Hall laid out an additional 134 lots. On June 1, 1793, the first 19 lots were sold, initiating the town of New Market. As time passed, the town developed as an important stopping point along the route. Residents developed churches, hotels, inns, a post office, taverns, blacksmith shops, and other crucial services, including doctors.

The New Market Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Henry Nelson House was listed on the NRHP in 1980 and Drummine Farm in 1987.

==Antiques Capital of Maryland==
New Market was once known as the &quot;Antiques Capital of Maryland&quot;. Downtown New Market once had a number of small shops specializing in the sale of antiques and other goods. While antiques tourism occurs year-round, New Market holds events and festivals that highlight the town&#x27;s historic past. &quot;Christmas in New Market&quot; is held on the first Saturday in December every year. From June through October each year, New Market hosts periodic 2nd Saturday events, featuring artists, food, vendors, free concerts, and movies. A &quot;Day in New Market&quot; festival was formerly held annually on the first Saturday in May.

<doc id="116432" wikidata="Q755596" url="?curid=116432" title="Thurmont, Maryland">
<text>Thurmont is a town in Frederick County, Maryland, United States. The population was 6,935 at the 2020 census. The town is located in the northern part of Frederick County (north of Frederick, the county seat), approximately ten miles from the Pennsylvania border, along U.S. Highway 15. It is very close to Cunningham Falls State Park and Catoctin Mountain Park, the latter of which contains the presidential retreat of Camp David. Thurmont is also home to Catoctin Colorfest, an arts and crafts festival that draws in about 125,000 people each autumn.

In 2005, Thurmont was designated as a Maryland Main Street Community, and in that year was designated a National Main Street under the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

== History ==
=== Name change ===
Originally incorporated as the Town of Mechanicstown in 1751, the name of the town was changed to Thurmont by an act of Maryland General Assembly on January 18, 1894. This name change was due to several other nearby towns having similar names, such as Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania and Mechanicsville, Maryland. Charles E. Cassell, editor of the local newspaper &quot;Catoctin Clarion&quot; was the one to suggest the name Thurmont and promoted debate about the name change in the &quot;Clarion&quot;. Some of the names considered included Beaufort, Eastmont, Glenmont, Monduru, Fern Glen, and Blue Point. Eventually, the options were pared down to two main contenders: Cassell&#x27;s suggestion of Thurmont, and local real estate broker Charles Shipley&#x27;s suggestion of Blue Mountain City, which he argued was &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;pretty&quot; during an address at a town meeting in December 1893. In the December 14, 1893, issue, the &quot;Clarion&quot; printed the following: The name is a misnomer: it is harshness long drawn out; it is an antique minus the lacquer; the sentimentalism that cries out against a change lacks its correlative, poetry, and smacks of the catacombs; its prestine [sic] glory is effaced by the ruthless circumstance of immigration to improve condition; an hundred, yea, hundreds of grandsons now recount to strangers in other States how their grand-fathers drove a thriving trade in factory, forge and mill in Mechanicstown and then confess--&quot;Ilium fuit; Delenda est Carthago!&quot; [Troy is no more; Carthage must be destroyed!]

By the end of December 1893, there had been several rounds of voting, and Thurmont had been officially chosen as the town&#x27;s new name. The &quot;Clarion&quot; noted, however, that &quot;the reception of a letter from the Postoffice Department saying that the name &#x27;Blue Mountain City&#x27; would not be approved by the Department as there is an office called &#x27;Blue Mountain&#x27; in the State, probably defeated the choice of that name.&quot;

The name Thurmont is derived from &quot;thur&quot;, the German word for gateway or entrance, and &quot;mons&quot;, the Latin word for mountain, roughly translating to &quot;Gateway to the Mountains.&quot;

=== Railroads ===

The Western Maryland Railway built its main railroad through Thurmont, connecting the town with Baltimore, and later with Hagerstown and Cumberland. On June 17, 1905, 16 men from Thurmont were killed in a railway wreck in Ransom, Maryland when a westbound freight train collided head-on with another train. All Thurmont businesses were closed on the Monday following the accident, and it became an event that had a lasting effect on the entire community. Another large railway accident occurred on June 25, 1915, when the Blue Mountain Express train hit another train head-on just west of Thurmont, killing 6 people. Charles Eyler, who was 17 years old at the time of the crash, said the following: &quot;People were still wondering the next day how the two engines had stayed on the rails. But it was easy to see how the wreck had occurred. The bridge is &#x27;blind&#x27; from both directions.&quot;

Thurmont is located at the eastern foothill of the Catoctin spur of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

<text>Accident is a town in Garrett County, Maryland, United States. The population was 338 at the 2020 United States census. Accident has been noted for its unusual place name. A resident of Accident is called an &quot;Accidental&quot;.

==History==
Accident was one of the early settlements in the far west of Maryland. The name originates about the time of the 1786 land survey. Though the origin or meaning of the name is unknown, one popular story says that Brooke Beall and William Deakins, Jr., friends from Prince George&#x27;s County, were conducting separate surveys in the area at the time and &quot;by accident&quot; Deakins claimed land already surveyed by Beall.

When Lord Baltimore opened up the area, which he called Monocacy Manor, for settlement, in the early 1770s, Brooke Beall secured permission to survey . It will never be known for certain how Beall came to choose this particular spot, but the surveyor was given clear instructions where to start. He was to begin &quot;in the center between two bounded white oak trees, standing on the North Side of the South fork of Bear Creek in or near a glade about one Hundred yards from said Run, about one or two Miles above a Lick known by the name of the &quot;Cole Mine Lick&quot;, about above the mouth of Broad Creek and about East of a Ridge of the Negro Mountain.&quot; John Hanson, Jr., later a delegate to the Continental Congress, and President of the United States in Congress Assembled, on April 14, 1774, surveyed the land, finding that it only contained . For the next twelve years, nothing was done with the survey. The American Revolutionary War intervened, and it was not until February 15, 1786, that the land was granted by means of a patent to William Deakins. The following year the surrounding countryside was surveyed into military lots by Francis Deakins, lots that were meant as compensation for the soldiers who served from Maryland during the Revolution. Each soldier who served for two years received one lot of , officers received four lots of each.
Kaese Mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The James Drane House was listed in 1985.

<text>Deer Park is a town in Garrett County, Maryland, United States. The population was 399 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh Media Market.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The town of Deer Park traces its history back to the 1770s, long before Garrett County was established. The town was part of property owned by Lord Baltimore and was originally surveyed on April 14, 1774. Deer Park saw immense growth during the mid to late 1880s, primarily because of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The Deer Park Hotel, constructed in 1872, served as the focal point for visitors who came to the mountaintop to enjoy the area&#x27;s scenery and cool temperatures during the summer months. Numerous large cottages were subsequently erected and made available to wealthy visitors.

President and Mrs. Grover Cleveland spent the first night of their honeymoon in Deer Park, June 3, 1886.

As automobiles became more readily available in the early 1900s, transportation was no longer limited to railroad service, and Deer Park lost its appeal as a vacation destination. The fortunes of the town took a gradual downturn. Fires and demolitions have destroyed many of the fine homes and hotels that once were abundant in the area.

Pennington Cottage was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Glamorgan was listed in 1984.

<text>Grantsville is a town in the northern part of Garrett County, Maryland, United States, near the Pennsylvania border. The population was 968 as of the 2020 census.

==History==

Grantsville, half a mile west of the Casselman River, began as a small Amish and Mennonite settlement, called Tomlinson&#x27;s or Little Crossing, along Braddock Road, which wound westward from Cumberland over Negro Mountain. Later a new village flourished as a stop along the nearby National Road, U.S. Route 40. From 1818, the national road carried hundreds of thousands of pioneers and settlers in stagecoaches and covered wagons. In the 1800s, an area just outside Grantsville (once known as Little Crossing but now marked by the intersection of Route 40 and River Road) was a major stop on the old National Pike. There is a &quot;dip&quot; in the road that travelers will not miss when they pass through Little Crossing on Route 40.
Signs mark the location of the post office and the blacksmith shop that stayed open all night to fix broken horseshoes. An 1879 article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot; described the wagons as &quot;so numerous that the leaders of one team had their noses in the trough at the end of the next wagon ahead.&quot;

The Casselman Inn sits in the center of town, where it has provided food and lodging to travelers since 1824. A sign outside displays a replica 1842 stagecoach advertisement.

Near the Casselman Bridge, a historic stone arch bridge, are Penn Alps Restaurant and The Spruce Forest Artisan Village, which was founded in 1957 by Alta Schrock. Penn Alps Restaurant is housed in the last log hospitality house on the National Pike. It is situated between a 1797 gristmill and the Casselman Bridge, the longest single span of stone in America when built in 1813.

Spruce Forest Artisan Village, a part of the extended Penn Alps campus, has grown from a few cabins to some 12 log and frame structures of early vintage, two of which date to the Revolutionary War Period. Most of these provide studio space for artisans. Artisans work in various media, including bird carving, stained glass, basket making, hand-loom weaving, and hand-thrown pottery.

==Transportation==

The main mode of transportation to Grantsville is by road. Interstate 68, U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 219 all traverse Grantsville via the National Freeway, an east-west freeway traversing western Maryland and northern West Virginia. Direct access to Grantsville is provided by an interchange with Maryland Route 495. U.S. Route 40 Alternate and Maryland Route 669 also serve Grantsville.

<text>Mountain Lake Park is a town in Garrett County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,147 as of the 2020 census.

==History==

Mountain Lake Park Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Creedmore was listed in 1984.

Mountain Lake Park was founded in 1881 as Maryland&#x27;s original Chautauqua resort community along the B&amp;O Railroad. Called the Mountain Chautauqua, the summer destination grew to be one of the nation&#x27;s top destinations over the course of three decades, attracting notable speakers like President William Howard Taft and William Jenning&#x27;s Bryan. President Benjamin Harrison made a reception stop after getting elected in 1889. The Railroad Evangelist, Jennie Smith, was a frequent speaker and resident of Mountain Lake Park, where she owned and operated the Grace Hotel. Before becoming internationally known as Carter the Great, the young magician was billed under his given name, Charles Carter.

Over 60 original buildings from the turn of the last century remain in Mountain Lake Park. Cottages and boarding homes were indicative of the community&#x27;s early years. Due to the variety of rural resort architectural styles, the National Register of Historic Places recognized the district. Many buildings feature porches adorned with scroll-sawn balustrades, cornices, and brackets used in fanciful ways. The original Ticket Office that accompanied the 5,000-seat Bashford Amphitheater was refurbished in 2002 and now serves as the town&#x27;s museum with an extensive display showcasing the town&#x27;s history. The Amphitheater was razed in the 1940s with the salvaged lumber used to build a number of homes. 

After visiting Chautauqua, New York, seven businessmen and ministers fashioned Mountain Lake Park after the New York model with Christian restrictions attached to each deed. They negotiated to add a depot with B&amp;O Railroad President John Work Garrett, after which the county is named. Among the founders was John Franklin Goucher, who helped found the college in Baltimore that bears his name. Goucher served as the last interim president of the Mountain Lake Park Association before it was sold to the Board of Foreign Missions. The town became incorporated in 1931 and is primarily a residential community. 

The original clay tennis courts, which the Women&#x27;s Civic Club began, have been maintained and are used today.

<text>Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) is a U.S. Army facility located adjacent to Aberdeen, Harford County, Maryland, United States. More than 7,500 civilians and 5,000 military personnel work at APG. There are 11 major commands among the tenant units, including:
* United States Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM)
* United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC)
* United States Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC)
* Edgewood Arsenal
* Adelphi Laboratory Center
** The Army Reserve Information Operations Command
** Unified Cross Domain Services Management Office
** HQ, U.S. Army Contracting Command (Army Contracting Command –APG, Adelphi Contracting Division)
** U.S. Army 93rd Signal Network - Network Enterprise Center
** Logistics Readiness Center
** U.S. Army Cyber Operation Group – 335th Signal Command
** Blossom Point Research Facility

==History==
APG is the U.S. Army&#x27;s oldest active proving ground, established on October 20, 1917, six months after the U.S. entered World War I. The planning and construction were overseen by Brigadier General Colden Ruggles, who later served as the Army&#x27;s Chief of Ordnance. Its location allowed design and testing of materiel to take place near contemporary industrial and shipping centers. The proving ground was created as a successor to the Sandy Hook Proving Ground, which was too small for some of the larger weapons being tested. At the peak of World War II, APG had billeting space for 2,348 officers and 24,189 enlisted personnel.

A notable scientist was James B. Conant, who helped develop Lewisite at Aberdeen, went on to become the President of Harvard, and oversaw the Manhattan Project for OSRD.

===Prompt critical excursion===
Aberdeen was home to the Army Pulse Radiation Facility Reactor, in 1968. On September 6, 1968, this reactor was the site of a prompt critical excursion during commissioning tests. This accident harmed no personnel but did release enough heat to reach the melting point of the fuel in the core, 1150 °C. This caused damage to the fuel components of the reactor, fusing the four central rings together. This is one of thirty-three prompt critical accidents worldwide, between 1949 and 2000.

===Base Realignment and Closure program===
Under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program, as announced in 2005, the APG is projected to lose the Ordnance School and associated R&amp;D facilities with 3862 military and 290 civilian jobs moving to Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia. APG will gain 451 military and 5,661 civilian jobs from Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. As a result, the net change is a loss of 3,411 military jobs and a gain of 5,371 civilian jobs.

==Edgewood Arsenal==

Although civilian contractors produced the major portion of conventional munitions for World War I, the United States government built federally owned plants on Aberdeen Proving Ground for the manufacture of toxic gas. These poison gas manufacturing facilities came to be known as Edgewood Arsenal. Edgewood Arsenal included plants to manufacture mustard gas, chloropicrin and phosgene, and separate facilities to fill artillery shells with these chemicals. Production began in 1918, reached per month, and totaled of toxic gas manufactured at Edgewood Arsenal before the November 1918 armistice. Some of this gas was shipped overseas for use in French and British artillery shells.

The Edgewood area of Aberdeen Proving Ground is approximately or . The Edgewood area was used for the development and testing of chemical agent munitions. From 1917 to the present, the Edgewood area conducted chemical research programs, manufactured chemical agents, and tested, stored, and disposed of toxic materials.

===Human experiments===
From 1955 to 1975, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps conducted classified medical studies at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland. The purpose was to evaluate the impact of low-dose chemical warfare agents on military personnel and to test protective clothing and pharmaceuticals. About 7,000 soldiers took part in these experiments that involved exposures to more than 250 different chemicals, according to the Department of Defense (DoD). Some of the volunteers exhibited symptoms at the time of exposure to these agents but long-term follow-up was not planned as part of the DoD studies.

The agents tested included chemical warfare agents and other related agents:
* Anticholinesterase nerve agents (Agent VX, sarin, and common organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate pesticides)
* Mustard agent
* Nerve agent antidotes atropine and scopolamine
* Nerve agent reactivators (e.g., the common OP antidote 2-PAM chloride)
* Psychoactive agents (LSD, PCP, cannabinoids, and Agent BZ)
* Irritants and riot control agents
* Alcohol and caffeine

During the week of July 14, 1969, personnel from Naval Applied Science Laboratory in conjunction with personnel from Limited War Laboratory conducted a defoliation test along the shoreline of Poole&#x27;s Island, Aberdeen Proving Ground using Agent Orange and Agent Orange Plus foam.

The Gunpowder Meetinghouse and Presbury Meetinghouse located within the grounds of Edgewood Arsenal are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Other component locations within Aberdeen Proving Ground==
Other parts of APG not attached to the main installation include the Churchville Test Area in Harford County, and the Carroll Island and Graces Quarters in Baltimore County, Maryland. The Churchville Test Area is a test track with hills that provide steep natural grades and tight turns to stress engines, drivetrains, and suspensions for army vehicles, including M1 Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and Humvees.

The eastern half of Carroll Island was used as a testing location for open air static testing of chemical weapons since the 1950s. During tests of chemical agents and other compounds at Carroll Island, Maryland, from July 1, 1964, to December 31, 1971, nearly of chemicals were disseminated on the test area including of irritants, of anticholinesterase compounds such as the nerve gasses Sarin and VX, and of incapacitants such as LSD. Simulant agents, incendiaries, decontaminating compounds, signaling and screening smokes, mustard, and herbicides were also released as well as riot control gasses. The test sites consisted of spray grids, a wind tunnel, test grids, and small buildings.

Edgewood Chemical Activity is a chemical-weapons located at APG. Elimination of the chemicals held here was put on an accelerated schedule after the September 11, 2001, attacks, and all chemical weapons were destroyed by February 2006.

Fort Hoyle was established on October 7, 1922, and was created from a portion of the Edgewood Arsenal. Named for Brigadier General Eli D. Hoyle, who had commanded the 6th Field Artillery Regiment, the post was home to Headquarters, 1st Field Artillery Brigade (1922 to 1939), the 6th Field Artillery Regiment (1922 to 1940), the 1st Ammunition Train (1922 to 1930), and the 99th Field Artillery Regiment (minus 2nd Battalion) (1940 to 1941). Fort Hoyle was officially disestablished as a separate military post when it was reabsorbed by Edgewood Arsenal on September 10, 1940.

The U.S. Army Ordnance Corps Museum previously located at APG, was moved to Fort Gregg-Adams, Virginia, as a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act.

==Geography==
APG occupies a land area of . Its northernmost point is near the mouth of the Susquehanna River, where the river enters the Chesapeake Bay, while on the south, it is bordered by the Gunpowder River. The installation lies on two peninsulas separated by the Bush River. The northeastern is known as the &quot;Aberdeen Area&quot; and the southwestern is called the &quot;Edgewood Area&quot; (formerly the &quot;Edgewood Arsenal&quot;).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (5.09%) is water.

==Demographics==
For statistical purposes the base is delineated as a census-designated place (Aberdeen Proving Ground CDP) by the U.S. Census Bureau. As of the 2020 census, the resident population was 1,668.

=== 2020 census ===
=== 2000 census ===
As of the census of 2000, there were 3,116 people, 805 households, and 763 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 902 housing units at an average density of .

==Contamination==
The Edgewood area of the Aberdeen Proving Ground site was proposed to the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s National Priorities List of the most serious uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites requiring long term remedial action on April 10, 1985. The site was formally added to the National Priorities List on February 21, 1990.

The Edgewood area has large areas of land and water and numerous buildings that are contaminated or suspected of contamination. Virtually all the land areas of the site contain contaminated or potentially contaminated sites and potentially buried ordnance. Substances disposed of in the area include significant quantities of napalm, white phosphorus, and chemical agents. On-site surface waters include rivers, streams, and wetlands.

Edgewood area standby water supply wells in the Canal Creek area previously served approximately 3,000 people. The wells have been abandoned. The Long Bar Harbor well field of the County Department of Public Works and the well field used by the Joppatowne Sanitary Subdistrict serve 35,000 people within of the site. On-site groundwater sampling has identified perchlorate, various metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and chemical warfare agent degradation products. On-site soil contamination sampling has identified various VOCs, metals, and unexploded ordnance in surface and subsurface soil. On-site surface water sampling has identified various metals, pesticides, phosphorus, and VOCs. People who accidentally ingest or come in direct contact with contaminated groundwater, surface water, soil, or sediments may be at risk. The area is a designated habitat for bald eagles.

==Controversies==

A scandal at the APG surfaced in 1996. The U.S. Army brought charges against twelve commissioned and non-commissioned male officers for sexual assault of female trainees under their command.

Following campaigning by PETA, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine and other organizations, the U.S. military announced in 2011 that it was replacing its use of monkeys in the Army&#x27;s nerve-agent attack training courses with human simulators and other non-animal teaching methods. The training drills had been carried out on vervet monkeys and conducted at Aberdeen Proving Ground.

A Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) broke free from its mooring station on APG October 28, 2015. It traveled for three hours through the skies, finally crashing in a wooded area in northeastern Pennsylvania.

<text>The town of Bel Air is the county seat of Harford County, Maryland. According to the 2020 United States census, the population of the town was 10,661.

The United States Census Bureau defines an urban area in northeast Maryland in which Bel Air is the principal settlement: the Bel Air–Aberdeen, MD urban area had a population of 214,647 as of the 2020 census, making it the 180th most-populous in the United States.

==History==

Bel Air&#x27;s identity has gone through several incarnations since 1780. Aquilla Scott, who had inherited land known as &quot;Scott&#x27;s Improvement Enlarged,&quot; planned the town on a portion that he called &quot;Scott&#x27;s Old Fields.&quot; Four years later, the town had expanded as local politicians, merchants, and innkeepers purchased lots from Scott, and the county commissioners decided to change its name to the more appealing &quot;Belle Aire.&quot; In his deeds, Scott dropped one letter, renaming the town, &quot;Bell Aire.&quot; Around 1798, court records dropped two more letters, and &quot;Bel Air&quot; was born.

During this period, Bel Air began to rise in prominence. In 1782, just two years after its founding, it became Harford&#x27;s county seat, and Daniel Scott (Aquilla&#x27;s son) started building a courthouse on Main Street. Although the town limits in the late 18th century encompassed nothing more than the two sides of Main Street, the days following the Civil War saw a building and land-development boom that remains in full swing to this day.

Bel Air was part of a land grant issued to Daniel Scott in 1731. In March 1782 &quot;Belle Aire&quot; was designated the county seat of Harford County. At the turn of the 20th century the &quot;e&quot; was dropped and the second &quot;l&quot; and its companion &quot;e&quot; gave way a few years later. The town&#x27;s incorporation was effective in 1874. The town began with just 42 lots along Main Street centering on the Court House and the county jail and sheriff&#x27;s house. Over the years, the population grew slowly to about 200 residents by 1865. The introduction of the canning industry, the Ma &amp; Pa railroad and related financial businesses jump started the growth after the Civil War. Although the town experienced periods of rapid growth followed by extremely slow growth over the next century, Bel Air&#x27;s role as the center of government and commerce continued to expand.

Since 1980, the town and its surrounding suburbs have grown substantially. Today, Bel Air is the center for governmental, educational, cultural, medical, and commercial institutions in the county.

In the early 20th century, several fires swept through the downtown area, notably in 1900 and 1942.
In 1972, another fire struck, decimating the east side of Main Street and causing $2 million in damage.

In 1970, H. Rap Brown, a member of the Black Panthers and the fourth chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), was charged with instigating a riot after a rally in Cambridge, Maryland; a change in venue brought his trial to Bel Air. Two black militants drove to Bel Air in a truck laden with plastic explosives, intending to attack the courthouse. Due to heavy security at the courthouse, the two men driving the truck fled on Route 1. The explosives subsequently detonated and killed both men. The blast left a crater in the road and blew out the windows of a nearby toll house. Brown would go on to escape the night of his trial.

Into the 1950s, the town hosted horse racing at Bel Air Racetrack, which stood where the Harford Mall is today.

The Bel Air Armory, Bel Air Courthouse Historic District, Broom&#x27;s Bloom, D. H. Springhouse, Dibb House, Graham-Crocker House, Graystone Lodge, Harford Furnace Historic District, Harford National Bank, Hays House, Hays-Heighe House, Heighe House, Joshua&#x27;s Meadows, Liriodendron, Mount Adams, Norris-Stirling House, Odd Fellows Lodge, Priest Neal&#x27;s Mass House and Mill Site, Proctor House, Thomas Run Church, Tudor Hall, The Vineyard, and Woodview are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Highways====
The primary means of transportation to and from Bel Air is by road, and the most prominent highway serving the town is Maryland Route 24. MD 24 provides the most direct link between Bel Air and the nearest U.S. Highway, U.S. Route 1, and the nearest Interstate highway, Interstate 95. US 1 formerly ran through the town, but now follows a bypass around the northwest side, with U.S. Route 1 Business following US 1&#x27;s former alignment through Bel Air. Maryland Route 924 also follows MD 24&#x27;s old alignment through downtown Bel Air. Finally, Maryland Route 22 provides a direct connection between Bel Air and the city of Aberdeen. By road, Bel Air is northeast of Baltimore, northeast of Washington, D.C., southwest of Philadelphia and southwest of New York City.

====Airports====
The three small plane airports in the metropolitan area are:
* Forest Hill Industrial Airpark
* Fallston Airport
* Harford County Airpark

====Railroads====
In the mid 20th century the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad (&quot;Ma and Pa&quot;) ran through town, but the tracks were dismantled in 1958. The station was located (at milepost 26.5) on Rockspring Ave. between Broadway and Ellendale St. Much of the railroad&#x27;s former route in and around Bel Air is now the Ma and Pa walking trail, which cuts through various wooded sections of town in and around Heavenly Waters Park.

====Bus service====
Harford Transit LINK is the primary means of transportation through Bel Air and to other areas of Harford County. The service operates 7 routes throughout the county, including the Orange Line, or the Bel Air Circulator. Other routes include the Blue Line to Edgewood, and the Green Line to Aberdeen and Havre De Grace. The Blue Line connects to the Edgewood MARC train station, and the Green Line connects with the Aberdeen Amtrak and MARC train station. The Harford Mall serves as the major transfer hub in the town.

Nearby, the MTA operates the 410 and 411 lines, which connect into downtown Baltimore.

===Law enforcement===
Bel Air&#x27;s primary law enforcement agency is the Bel Air Police Department which was established in 1874. Its headquarters is located at 39 N. Hickory Avenue. Overseeing the department is Charles Moore, lifelong Harford County resident and former Maryland State Police captain.

== Culture ==
Bel Air includes one of Maryland&#x27;s 24 designated arts and entertainment districts. The district consists of 99 acres, which includes most of the city&#x27;s downtown. It is used for concerts, art galleries, and other venues and events.

==Publications==
&quot;The Aegis&quot; is the main daily print news publication for Bel Air and surrounding Harford County.
Bel Air News and Views is a popular online community news publication started in 2006.

== Government ==
Bel Air is governed by a Council-Manager form of government. It is led by a five-member Board of Town Commissioners. The Board appoints a Town Administrator, who is responsible for the daily functions of municipal government. The chair of the Board, elected by its members each year, is given the ceremonial title of Mayor of Bel Air.

All five Bel Air Town Commissioners are Republicans, though municipal elections are officially nonpartisan.

<text>Havre de Grace (), abbreviated HdG, is a city in Harford County, Maryland, United States. It is situated at the mouth of the Susquehanna River and the head of Chesapeake Bay. It is named after the port city of Le Havre, France, which in full was once &quot;Le Havre de Grâce&quot; (French, &quot;Harbor of Grace&quot;).

The population was 12,952 at the 2010 U.S. census. In 2014, &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine called it one of the 20 best small U.S. towns to visit.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
During the Revolutionary War, the small hamlet known as Harmer&#x27;s Town was visited several times by General Lafayette, who became considered a hero of the war. He commented that the area reminded him of the French seaport of Le Havre on the English Channel. It had originally been named &quot;Le Havre-de-Grâce&quot;. Inspired by Lafayette&#x27;s comments, the residents incorporated the town as &quot;Havre de Grace&quot; in 1785.

George Washington stayed overnight in the town in 1789 on the journey to New York City for his first inauguration. During the First Congress in 1789, Havre de Grace missed by only one vote being named the capital of the fledgling United States.

=== 19th century ===

On May 3, 1813, during the War of 1812, British forces led by Sir George Cockburn executed a raid on Havre de Grace, routing the American militiamen defending it and burning large parts of the village. American Lieutenant John O&#x27;Neill single-handedly manned a cannon to help defend the town. He was wounded, captured by the British, and quickly released. In gratitude, Havre de Grace made O&#x27;Neill and his descendants the hereditary keepers of the Concord Point lighthouse, which marks the mouth of the Susquehanna River.

The early industry of Havre de Grace included oyster and crab harvesting. Extensive fruit orchards were cultivated in and near the town. Products were shipped to markets along the East Coast and upriver.

The town was the southern terminus for the Proprietors of the Susquehanna Canal and later the Susquehanna and Tidewater Canal. This was built to bypass difficult navigational areas of the lower Susquehanna River between Havre de Grace and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania, where it connected to the Pennsylvania Canal. It was built between 1836 and 1840. Operations on the canal declined after 1855 because of competition from railroads, which could carry freight more quickly. The Lock Keeper&#x27;s house and remnants of the canal exist today as a museum.

Havre de Grace was a primary town on the Eastern route of the Underground Railroad in Maryland, as refugee slaves could cross the Susquehanna to havens in the free state of Pennsylvania, traveling on to Philadelphia and New York. Prior to 1840, escaped slaves from communities along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay came to Havre de Grace and often took the ferry across the Susquehanna River to safe sites in Lancaster and Chester counties in Pennsylvania. When &quot;vigilance increased at the ferry&quot;, the African-American refugees were guided upriver to cross to Columbia, Pennsylvania, a town established by abolitionist Quakers. Because Havre de Grace had varied transportation across the river, refugees were often successful in making their way to the North.

In the 19th century, Havre de Grace became known for duck hunting, and was a seasonal destination for hunters. They stayed at the town hotels and hired local guides to escort them hunting on the river and along the bay. Local artisans became known for making high quality decoys, which they carved and painted. Prime examples are displayed today at the Decoy Museum of the city.

By the 1860s, a large population of free African Americans had settled in the town. It had enough business to support independent artisans, and numerous jobs associated with shipping on the river and canal and, increasingly, with the railroads. During the American Civil War, this town was one of seven sites where the Army recruited for volunteers for the U.S. Colored Troops, composed of African-American men. Although located in the tidewater area of Harford County, which still had large plantations and slaveholders, the city&#x27;s river and canals tied it to northern industry and trade in Pennsylvania and beyond. These provided urban jobs for free blacks, and the town had a strong proportion of Northern sympathizers among whites.

In 1878, the town became a city and established its own government. Shortly after 1878, Stephen J. Seneca opened a fruit-packing factory in the S. J. Seneca Warehouse, with a tin can factory next to Havre de Grace Waterfront. Seneca made improvements to canning with his patents, such as the &quot;Can-soldering machines&quot; of 1889, and 1891. By 1899, Seneca had become a canned goods broker. The first railroad was constructed along St. Clair Street (now Pennington Ave.) to the river, so Seneca&#x27;s factory was well-positioned for both water and rail shipping. Up until the Second World War, many farmers in Harford County brought their produce to the Seneca Factory (later run as Stockhams Cannery). S.J. Seneca lived at 200 North Union Ave., served as Mayor of Havre de Grace (1893-1894), and donated funds and land to build the Methodist Church.

The Seneca cannery, now adapted for use as an antique shop, is a very good example of a late 19th-century brick industrial building. It has a severely classical facade and massive stone buttresses at the rear.

=== 20th century ===

Many patents followed the opening of the S. J. Seneca Cannery. 1901 The Baling-press. 1905 The Cooker 1905 The Tomato-scalder. 1917 Improved Tomato-scalder. 1917 The Can-opener. 1918 The Machine for peeling tomatoes.

Havre de Grace was known as &quot;The Graw&quot; from 1912 through the 1950s. It prospered as a stop for north–south travelers. These included gangsters and gamblers &quot;en route&quot; to New York City from the South following the &quot;pony routes&quot;. The Havre de Grace Racetrack operated from 1912 to 1950. Chicago gangster Al Capone was reported to have stayed at the former &quot;Chesapeake Hotel&quot; (now known as &quot;Backfin Blues; Creole de Graw&quot;). At the end of the 1950s, the state removed the horse track. Its race and betting rights were bought by the larger Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.

In 1949, the city denied a license to use a city park and arrested a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses preacher. The resulting case reached the US Supreme Court; in &quot;Niemotko v. Maryland&quot; (1951), the court ruled that Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were protected by constitutional rights to the free exercise of religion, and the city should have granted them the permit to speak in the park.

A few tenant farmhouses remain from the large Mitchel plantation that overlooked the city. In the 1980s, Havre de Grace began to undergo extensive redevelopment as people were attracted to its unique character. Historic properties were renovated and sometimes adapted for new uses. In addition, former farmland was redeveloped for construction of new houses and, later, townhouse communities. It became a destination for people with &quot;second homes&quot; for vacations on the bay and retirees. Historic lands and older forests are being cleared, and expensive houses are now extending and growing along Chapel Road northwest toward Webster Village. Since the late 20th century, the city has benefited through development of new properties, antique stores, and other retail venues.

Per capita income doubled in the city from 1990 to 2000, with the arrival of wealthier residents to the newer suburban projects around and in the city. Some commute to jobs elsewhere; others are retirees. New suburban developments since the 1990s brought thousands of middle-to-upper-class residents to the town. Many working-class citizens who used to live in the city have been displaced by rising property values and gentrification.

=== 21st century ===

In September 2003, Hurricane Isabel flooded the city about two blocks into downtown, destroying the promenade. It was rebuilt in 2004, with help from Americorps NCCC. Today, it serves as a waterfront boardwalk and nature walk from Tydings Park to the Maritime Museum, and on to Concord Point Lighthouse.

Havre de Grace expanded in the early 21st century by annexing land. Housing development is moderate but steady.

Havre de Grace has been affected by the BRAC activities of the Department of Defense. DOD recently moved activities and personnel from various bases to the Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), a few miles away, which has added to the demand for housing and services.

<text>Joppatowne is a census-designated place in southwestern Harford County, Maryland, United States. Serving as a bedroom community for nearby Baltimore, it was established in 1961 as a planned unit development (PUD). The population was 12,616 at the 2010 census, up from 11,391 in 2000.

Joppatowne is covered by the &quot;Joppa&quot; ZIP Code of 21085, and &quot;Joppa&quot; is a designated planning region for Harford County. The Joppa ZIP code (21085) extends north of Joppatowne, as far as Benson, just south of Bel Air.

The namesake of both Joppatowne and Joppa is the original town of &quot;Joppa&quot; (Jaffa, Israel). It was a major seaport in American colonial times and the county seat of the original Baltimore County until 1768. Its site is located within the boundaries of present-day Joppatowne.

==Colonial history==
In colonial America there were three towns in the area of present-day Joppatowne, each established and abandoned in succession: Gunpowder Town, Foster&#x27;s Neck, and Joppa. The first two were short-lived, but Joppa proved quite successful for some 50 years.

Gunpowder Town, or simply &quot;Gunpowder&quot;, was a failed English settlement that pre-dated colonial Joppa, and was located close to it. This first attempt to establish an English settlement on the Gunpowder River was apparently abandoned because it proved to be a poor location. Though documents and records exist for the settlement, including official papers in the archives of the United Kingdom, nobody knows exactly where it was located. It was somewhere northwest of present-day Joppatowne, situated between the confluence of the Big Gunpowder and Little Gunpowder, at a place known as &quot;Sim&#x27;s Point&quot;. Its location cannot be accurately pinpointed because at that time the mouths of the Big and Little Gunpowder were about a mile further inland (above present-day U.S. Route 40). No trace of the town is known to have ever been found.

In 1706 the Provincial Assembly of Maryland chartered another town nearby, known as &quot;Foster&#x27;s Neck&quot;. It was located on the eastern bank of the Gunpowder River, at the stream later known as Foster Branch (or &quot;Foster&#x27;s Branch&quot;), at the southernmost boundary of present-day Joppatowne. Again, though mill ruins are visible in this area near the stream, the town&#x27;s precise location is unknown. Foster&#x27;s Neck was intended to succeed the town of Old Baltimore (no relation to Baltimore City) on the Bush River as the county seat of Baltimore County. However, Foster&#x27;s Neck was abandoned a year later, in 1707, reportedly due to an outbreak of smallpox. St. John&#x27;s Parish of the established Anglican Church temporarily moved inland, to where the Officer&#x27;s Club at the Edgewood area of Aberdeen Proving Ground is currently located. It relocated to Joppa in 1712. After the decline of Joppa following the designation of the city of Baltimore as the county seat in 1768, St. John&#x27;s Parish was moved to nearby Kingsville in the late 18th century, where it has stayed. A new St. John&#x27;s Parish Church was built by Edward Day in Kingsville in 1817 to replace the St. John&#x27;s Parish Church at &quot;Joppa Town&quot; which has declined into ruins.

The original Joppa was a major seaport and commercial hub in the 18th century. The town proper was located on what is now called Rumsey Island, where the Big Gunpowder Falls and Little Gunpowder Falls meet to form the Gunpowder River. The only original building remaining is the Rumsey Mansion, once home of colonial patriot Benjamin Rumsey. Building foundations and gravesites are visible on the adjacent Church of the Resurrection property. Ruins of the original wharf and docks, as well as the town jail, were still visible until Hurricane Agnes swept through in 1972. The Old Joppa Site was added to the National Register of Historic Places as an archeological site in 1979.
Joppa was the county seat of Baltimore County from 1712 to 1768. Present-day Harford County was part of Baltimore County until 1773.

Joppa&#x27;s &quot;mile wide harbor&quot; on the Gunpowder River could accommodate the largest ocean-going ships of the day. Joppa was Maryland&#x27;s most important commercial center in colonial times, with tobacco being the primary commodity crop and export. Long before Baltimore was established, this was one of the busiest ports in the western hemisphere.

Joppa was a vital hub for land transportation, and it was said that &quot;all roads lead to Joppa&quot;. It was the original terminus for Joppa Road, which ran northwest to what is now Towson and north to York, Pennsylvania (prior to the York Road being built in 1810). Joppa Road connected to Rolling Road to points west. The original post road to Philadelphia also went through Joppa, and a ferry across the Gunpowder River connected to points south via what is now the community of Chase and Eastern Avenue. Many famous colonial figures invariably passed through and boarded at Joppa.

Economic growth was also stimulated via the establishment of various commercial enterprises just north of Joppa, which used water power generated by Little Gunpowder Falls. The most notable of these is the still standing Jerusalem Mill Village complex in Kingsville. It fabricated weapons for the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.

As the state&#x27;s primary port-of-entry and county seat of its most populous county, Joppa was the focal point of virtually all aspects of colonial life in central Maryland. Joppa was the hub for all communications and media of the day, and central Maryland&#x27;s ground-zero for politics and elections. Many major horse races were held there. Many convicted criminals were publicly hanged there on the courthouse grounds in formal, sanctioned executions.

By the end of the 18th century, agricultural and other land development upstream caused the Gunpowder River and Joppa&#x27;s harbor to silt up, making access by large ships impossible. Ellicott City&#x27;s port suffered a similar fate. Baltimore became Maryland&#x27;s major shipping port, and in 1768 the county seat was moved to Baltimore. Joppa went into decline, and by 1814 was mostly abandoned.

Benjamin Rumsey (1734–1808), the namesake of Rumsey Island and the Rumsey Mansion (the only colonial building that survived the decline of Joppa), was a delegate for Maryland to the Second Continental Congress, and the first Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals, serving for more than 25 years (1778–1806). In 1768 Rumsey married the widow of Colonel James Maxwell. He had been the primary planter and landowner in Joppa, and commissioned the &quot;Rumsey Mansion&quot; to be built between 1720 and 1724.

Rumsey relocated from Cecil County to Joppa sometime around 1771, after having the Rumsey Mansion substantially renovated. Rumsey eventually acquired all the land where Joppa once stood, and all of the surrounding areas. This large estate came to be known as &quot;Joppa Farm&quot;, a slave plantation. Upon Rumsey&#x27;s death in 1808, Joppa Farm passed to his son John Beal Rumsey and/or his grandson Charles Henry Rumsey. Upon C.H. Rumsey&#x27;s death, his children sold Joppa Farm to the Murray family. James Murray was the owner of Joppa Farm until it was purchased by Beulah Hare Chell in 1936. In 1961 the Panitz Brothers Company acquired the land from Beulah Hare Chell to develop a planned community Joppatowne. Maryland Historical Society records show the property was owned by the &quot;Maryland-Virginia Joint Stock Land Bank&quot; in 1936, during the heart of the Great Depression.

== Civil War ==

On July 11, 1864, Confederate cavalry under the command of Colonel Harry W. Gilmor attacked the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (now Amtrak) train bridge over the Gunpowder River, next to Foster Branch, at what is now the southeastern border of Joppatowne. Gilmore&#x27;s 135 troops overwhelmed the Union force of 70 guarding the bridge. The Confederates captured two trains, one north and one southbound, evacuated the passengers, took a Union general prisoner, captured supplies, cut telegraph lines, and set fire to one of the trains before backing it over and partially destroying the railroad bridge. The raid, regarded as one of the most daring ever attempted by detached cavalry on either side during the war, would become known as &quot;Gilmor&#x27;s Raid&quot;, or &quot;The Magnolia Station Raid&quot;.

== Resurrection ==

The area where the town at Joppa formerly stood was used as farmland (mostly string beans) until 1961. It was acquired by the Panitz Company (Panitz Bros. &amp; Co.), which began development of the surrounding planned community of &quot;Joppatowne&quot;. The original townsite at Joppa, including the Rumsey Mansion, was slated to be developed as Joppatowne&#x27;s &quot;swim and tennis club&quot;. People interested in historical preservation opposed this plan, but were nearly ignored until the matter reached the attention of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. Mrs. Kennedy convinced the developers to relocate the swim club, and to cede the land where Joppa&#x27;s Anglican church stood to the Episcopal Church. The latter became independent after the Revolution but is arguably descended from the Church of England. The Panitz Company sold and donated additional adjacent lots to the Episcopal Church, effectively preserving about 50% of the land where the town at Joppa had stood (the northern half of the site had already been considerably developed).

In 1970 the Episcopal Church subsequently re-consecrated the grounds and built the aptly named Church of the Resurrection adjacent to the foundation of the original &quot;St. John&#x27;s Parish&quot; at Joppa. The Church of the Resurrection has preserved the archaeological ruins and served as a repository for documents, research, and artifacts related to the colonial town at Joppa.

Charles B. Anderson, Jr., Harford County Commissioner from 1970 to 1974 and County Executive from 1974 to 1978, acquired the dilapidated Rumsey Mansion and about of surrounding grounds in the 1960s. He had it completely restored. He and other owners have used it solely as a private residence, and it is not open to the public for tours.

As of 2012, Case Mason in Joppa manufactures and fills products for the Rosebud Perfume Company in Woodsboro, using tins made in Baltimore.

==Representation in popular culture==
Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives; William R. Forstchen, and Albert S. Hanser wrote an alternate history novel called &quot;Grant Comes East: A Novel of the Civil War&quot;. It features a fictional American Civil War battle called the Battle of Gunpowder River at colonial Joppa.

House of Cards was shot in the area, and Joppa is mentioned in the opening episode of season two.

<text>Riverside is a census-designated place (CDP) in Harford County, Maryland, United States. The population was 6,425 at the 2010 census. The term &quot;Riverside&quot; is generally used interchangeably with &quot;Belcamp&quot;; both names are accepted for the U.S. Postal Service&#x27;s ZIP Code of 21017. However, the original community of Belcamp is located south of U.S. Route 40, outside the Riverside CDP.

==Geography==

==Commerce==
One of the major revenue sources in Riverside is derived from its location, connecting Route 40 with Interstate 95 via Route 543. Hence, many of the commercial establishments in this area are designed for long-distance drivers. These include four hotels and four gas stations/convenience stores. All commercially zoned property is located off Route 543, also known as the Riverside Parkway.

The Riverside area also includes multiple business parks, among which is a major industrial park that features numerous corporations and business offices such as Northrop Grumman. Mercedes-Benz had a manufacturing building at one time, but that is now closed and the building is for sale. A business park built on Route 40 at the former site of the Bata Shoes factory opened in 2000 and originally provided offices for Clark Turner Signature Homes and SURVICE Engineering. Expansion to the business park has brought in Booz Allen Hamilton and SafeNet.

<text>Elkridge is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Howard County, Maryland, United States. The population was 15,593 at the 2010 census. Founded early in the 18th century, Elkridge is adjacent to two other counties, Anne Arundel and Baltimore.

==History==

Elkridge qualifies as the oldest settlement in its present county, when Howard was a part of Anne Arundel County. Its location on the Patapsco River was a key element in its growth. The Maryland General Assembly elected a law to erect a , forty-lot town at the pre-existing settlement of Elkridge Landing to be called &quot;Jansen Town&quot; in 1733. In 1738 an attempt to formalize the town failed with the death of the commissioners before passage. In 1750 a second attempt to formalize the town was attempted around the lands of Phillip Hammond. By comparison, Baltimore Town consisted of only 25 dwellings at that time. A third petition was filed in 1762.

The settlement was founded as a place where planters, who each had a wharf along the river, could bring their tobacco crop to be loaded on English trading ships. Later, Elkridge Landing was built as the seaport dock for the community. In 1755 the Elkridge Furnace was founded at the Elkridge Furnace Complex, a historic iron works located on approximately and including six remaining buildings of an iron furnace which operated into the 1860s. The millrace that fed water to the furnace was filled in during the 1920s to create the current &quot;Race Road&quot;. The Hockley Forge and Mill were created upstream in 1760. In 1781, Lafayette camped light infantry at Elkridge Landing en route to Virginia during the Revolutionary war. In 1825, Jansen Town burned, taking out all of the oldest buildings at the Landing and 9 out of 10 houses in the village. The same year, on October 12, 1825, the Elkridge Landing postal stop was created.

Elkridge has historic churches, including Melville Church on Furnace Avenue. Its original building was the first Methodist church built (1772) and was visited on the circuit rides of Francis Asbury. Saint Augustine Church, on Old Washington Road, was built in 1845 and opened its parochial school in 1870.

Elkridge had a rich history of industries, including pig-iron forging, basket weaving, paper, cotton and grist milling, as well as employment from the B&amp;O Railroad. The Thomas Viaduct, located over Levering Avenue at the entrance to the Patapsco Valley State Park, is the oldest multiple-arched curved stone railroad bridge in the world. Built in 1833, its architect was Benjamin Latrobe, Jr. The B&amp;O first used horse-drawn coaches in relays, hence Relay Station was added. The viaduct also carried the Tom Thumb, and the first telegraph message from Washington, D.C., stating &quot;What hath God wrought?&quot; was wired across.

Elkridge did not escape the Civil War. Union troops guarded the Thomas Viaduct and the thoroughfare to Baltimore with a captured Winans Steam Gun while camping on Lawyers Hill, a community of summer estates built over the years by residents such as Caleb Dorsey (&quot;Belmont&quot;), Baltimore City Supreme Bench Judge George Washington Dobbin (&quot;the Lawn&quot;), Thomas Donaldson (&quot;Edgewood&quot;), John Latrobe (&quot;Fairy-Knowe&quot;), and the Penniman family home (&quot;Wyndhurst&quot;). Some of these families had slaves.

Their estate cottages were built along the top of the Lawyers Hill, including along Old Lawyers Hill Road, on which at one corner stands the Elkridge Assembly Rooms. This community hall, built in 1871, was a neutral meeting place for entertainments for Northern and Southern sympathizers of the neighborhood and owned by them as stockholders. Neighbors did not betray neighbors and each protected others&#x27; property from advancing troops. Many homes remain, while others burned and have not been rebuilt, such Fairie Knowe in 1850 and 1900. The Lawyers Hill Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

The Washington Turnpike Road Company built what is now Washington Boulevard between 1796 and 1812, creating a major north–south land route that is now U.S. Route 1. As automobiles became a popular alternative to rail, the corridor became the key road and commercial corridor between Baltimore and Washington. With increased travel speeds, Elkridge was the location of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; near Ducketts Lane. In 1915, bus service was started between Elkridge and the terminal adjacent to the Montgomery Ward Warehouse and Retail Store in Baltimore.

In 1939, the Andrews Brothers opened the first mobile home park in Elkridge. In 1987, Howard County commissioned studies to develop commercial properties that were not detailed in the 1980 general plan.

Interstate 95 forms the northwestern edge of the Elkridge census-designated place, and Interstate 895 crosses the northern corner of the community. Interstate 195 passes just east of Elkridge, with access from its Exit 3 with Washington Boulevard. Maryland Route 100 runs through the southern part of Elkridge, providing access to Ellicott City and Glen Burnie. The Baltimore-Washington Parkway travels just to the east of Elkridge, and will eventually include an interchange with Hanover Road, providing another method of travel to Elkridge from the south.

The historic B&amp;O rail line owned by CSX provides the eastern border for most of Elkridge.

<text>Ellicott City is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in, and the county seat of, Howard County, Maryland, United States. Part of the Baltimore metropolitan area, its population was 75,947 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous unincorporated county seat in the country.

Ellicott City&#x27;s historic downtownthe Ellicott City Historic Districtlies in the valleys of the Tiber and Patapsco rivers. The historic district includes the Ellicott City Station; it is the oldest surviving train station in the United States, having been built in 1830 as the first terminus of the original B&amp;O Railroad line. The historic district of the town is often called &quot;Historic Ellicott City&quot; or &quot;Old Ellicott City&quot; to distinguish it from the surrounding suburbs that extend south to Columbia and west to West Friendship.

==History==

===Milling===
Prior to the establishment of Ellicott City, the main crossing of the Patapsco River connecting Baltimore with western Maryland stood about three miles north at what is now Hollifield (Old Frederick Road and Johnnycake Road). The main road continued west towards Mount Airy and Frederick along what later became Maryland Route 99. The first mill at that site on the river had been built by Christopher Gardiner in about 1716. Near this place, in 1766, James Hood used the &quot;Maryland Mill Act of 1669&quot; to condemn for a mill site adjacent to his river-side property, where he built a gristmill. His son Benjamin rebuilt the corn grinding mill after one of the frequent Patapsco floods in 1768. 

On 24 April 1771, three Quaker brothers from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, north of Philadelphia, chose the picturesque wilderness several miles upriver from Elk Ridge Landing (today&#x27;s Elkridge, Maryland), the uppermost part of the river then navigable by tobacco-loading sailing merchant ships in the 18th century, to establish a flour mill, purchasing of Baltimore County land from Emanuel Teal and from William Williams. John, Andrew, and Joseph Ellicott founded &quot;Ellicott&#x27;s Mills&quot;, which became one of the largest milling and manufacturing towns in the East. 

In 1774, Joseph Ellicott purchased Hood&#x27;s Mill for 1,700 pounds, which became known as &quot;Ellicott&#x27;s Upper Mills&quot;. In 1775 the brothers expanded their holdings with from Bartholomew Balderson. Nathaniel sold his partnership in 1777, and Joseph sold all but his Hood&#x27;s Mill ownership the next year. With the development of Ellicott&#x27;s Mills, the main road connecting Baltimore to the west shifted southward from the Upper Mills to the Lower Mills at Ellicott City. This route later was incorporated into the Baltimore and Frederick-Town Turnpike and the National Road.

The town retained the name &quot;Ellicott&#x27;s Mills&quot; when the U.S. Postal stop opened on October 7, 1797.
The Ellicott brothers constructed sawmills, smithies, stables, an oil mill, a grain distillery, and grain mills. They helped revolutionize farming in the area by persuading farmers to plant wheat instead of tobacco and also by introducing Plaster of Paris fertilizer to revitalize depleted soil. The Ellicotts produced the product until a fire on 11 January 1809. Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737–1832), the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, a rare Roman Catholic and a wealthy landowner with the largest fortune then in colonial America, was an early influential convert from tobacco to wheat. By 1830, the founders&#x27; families could no longer support operations, and by 1840, the Ellicott family sold off their interests in the two flour mills, the granite quarry, the saw mill and plaster mill.

===Rail===
In 1830, Ellicott&#x27;s Mills became the first terminus of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad outside Baltimore, the first commercially operated cargo and passenger railroad in the country. The B&amp;O was organized in 1827 and had its &quot;first stone&quot; laid the following year with major ceremonies on July 4, Independence Day, with the beginning of construction. The Ellicott City Station, built on an embankment across the corner of the town and along the Patapsco River and intersecting Tiber Creek stream, with its &quot;Oliver Viaduct&quot;, named for a B&amp;O board member Robert Oliver crossing over the National Road of large blocks of locally quarried gray granite, stands today as a living history museum, and has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior, administered by the National Park Service. It bears the designation as the &quot;Oldest surviving railroad station in America&quot;. In 1829, New York industrialist and Baltimore foundry-owner Peter Cooper began testing his iron steam engine, &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; (1791–1883), on the B&amp;O Railway. This was the first time a steam locomotive was used to transport persons over rails in the United States. The famous race between &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; and a horse-drawn rail carriage took place between Relay Junction on the return trip from Ellicott&#x27;s Mills towards Baltimore in August 1830. Even though the horse won the race due to a sudden broken drive belt on the &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;, it heralded the time when steam engines steadily improved, and the soon-to-be steam-operated railroad became a vital link in the town&#x27;s economy and later expanding to the city of Baltimore&#x27;s economic supremacy along with the state in the nation. 

The site of the Howard County Courthouse, which was built from 1840 to 1843 in the former western Howard District of Anne Arundel County, Maryland, was so designated for the new temporary district in 1839, and continued and was expanded later when Howard County became an official independent jurisdiction in 1851, as one of the 23 counties (plus Baltimore as an independent city) in the state of Maryland. The town in 1851 was in a spate of depression as low costs shut the Maryland Machine Manufacturing Company. Over 80 vacant dwellings lined the Howard County side of the river. By 1861, Ellicott&#x27;s Mills was a prosperous farming and manufacturing area.

At the start of the Civil War on April 19, 1861, &quot;Gaithers Raiders&quot;, part of the Confederate &quot;Howard County Dragoons&quot; from Oakland Manor, marched through Ellicott&#x27;s Mills to Baltimore, responding to the Baltimore riot of 1861, before heading south to join J. E. B. Stuart. Later that month, Union Army troops seized the &quot;Winans Steam Gun&quot; which had been en route to Harpers Ferry, Virginia, at Ellicott&#x27;s Mills. The experimental gun had been developed by local Southern-sympathizer railroad builder and industrialist Ross Winans. In the fall of 1862, the 12th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry was assigned to guard Ellicott&#x27;s Mills, setting up the 1,200-man Camp Johnson on the lawn of the nearby Patapsco Female Institute. On July 10, 1864, the third Confederate invasion of the North, led by General Jubal Early, forced the retreat of the Federal troops under the command of General Lew Wallace down the National Pike from the Battle of the Monocacy to the B.&amp; O.&#x27;s Ellicott&#x27;s Mills station and to Baltimore. The one-day delay by Wallace&#x27;s small force at Monocacy Junction enabled Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to rush troops in time to defend the U.S. capital. Homes and churches in Ellicott&#x27;s Mills were temporarily used as hospitals for the Union wounded.

In 1866, cholera broke out. In the same year, the Granite Mills cotton factory owned by Benjamin Detford burned down.

===Incorporation and disincorporation===
In 1867, a city incorporation charter was secured for Ellicott&#x27;s Mills forming a local government with a mayor and council, and the name was changed to &quot;Ellicott City&quot;.

The first mayor was E. A. Talbot, who lived in a stone house and operated a lumber yard at the base of the river. His business was washed away in the flood of 1866, and again in 1868. He was offered a clear title on his home from his opponent Issacs if he threw his reelection, which he did. Talbot relocated uphill to a brick and granite store designed by Charles Timanus that houses the Ellicott City Brewing Company today.
Howard County built its first jailhouse, the Ellicott City Jail, also called Emory Jail or Willow Grove, on Emory Avenue in 1878. The stone jail intended for 12 inmates operated until the Howard County Detention Center opened in 1983.

In 1879, political gangs controlled the polling locations, shooting and wounding African American Ellicott City voters. The deputy sheriff declined to arrest the leaders for fear of his life and further outbreaks of violence.

In H. L. Mencken&#x27;s best-selling memoir &quot;Happy Days, 1880–1892&quot;, he described his childhood in the chapter &quot;Rural Delights&quot; while living with his parents in their rented home in Ellicott City.

Ellicott City favored the temperance movement, enacting a law against &quot;spiritous, fermented or intoxicating liquors&quot; in 1882, taking effect May 1, 1883. This was shortly changed to limit sales of liquor to licensed shops that did not sell other goods, providing the primary source of the town&#x27;s tax income.

Trolley service was proposed from Baltimore to Ellicott City in 1892, approved on April 20, 1895, and implemented in 1899. The service ran a double-ended streetcar for most of its service life until 1955, when the Baltimore Service commission recommended a bus replacement, which lasted only two years. The Catonsville &amp; Ellicott City Electric Railway Company rail line was later converted to a hiking trail. 

In February 1895, shop owner Daniel F. Shea was murdered by Jacob Henson. Henson was tried and sentenced to death. Fearing that Governor Brown might release Henson due to insanity, a group of residents broke into the jail and lynched Henson on Merricks Lane with a sign saying &quot;Brown cannot rule our cort&quot;. Governor Brown condemned the citizens and ordered all prisoners sentenced to death be sent to the Maryland Penitentiary from then on.

After a difficult start in 1896, granite mining was started.

In 1907, Taylor Manor started as the Patapsco Manor Sanitarium built on property along New Cut Road. In 1939 the facility was purchased by Issac Taylor and run as the Pinel Clinic. Taylor operated an optometrist business and Taylor&#x27;s Furniture on Main Street. In 1948 the facility expanded to 48 beds, and in 1968 it expanded to 151 beds. The modernist circular rotunda stands out at the center of campus. Taylor Manor covered more than . In 2000, the facility became a branch of Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital.

In 1924, the Display Machine Doughnut Corporation moved to Ellicott City from New York, occupying the site of the 1916 Patapsco Flouring Mill built on the ruins of the former Elicott and Gambrill&#x27;s mills. The company made doughnut mix and doughnut manufacturing machines as the Doughnut Corporation of America.

The only chartered city in the county, Ellicott City lost its charter in 1935 with a proposal from Senator Joseph Donovan, as the tax base from saloon fees lost in Prohibition caused citizen protest when taxes were shifted to residents.

On April 27, 1941, a fire gutted the eight-story doughnut factory, but it rebuilt, providing doughnut mixes to WWII troops. In January 1942, an emergency room was set up in the post office for civilian defense for the ongoing war effort.

In 1943, the Metropolitan District was formed to bring water and sewer to Ellicott City, sponsored by newspaperman P.G. Stromberg, I.H. Taylor, Charles E. Miller, Marray G. Peddicord, John A. Lane, and W. Emil Thompson.

===Suburban development=== 
In 1955, County Commissioner Norman E. Moxley created the city&#x27;s first major subdivision, Normandy Heights. The first major shopping center, Normandy Shopping Center, was constructed. Alda Hopkins Clark purchased the Ellicott City First Presbyterian Church to donate it to the Howard County Historical Society.

In 1958, &quot;The Goddess&quot;, a film loosely based on Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s life, was shot on location in the city.
Before 1962, the only polling location for Howard County voters was in Ellicott City. In May 1962, voters were offered a second location to vote, also in Ellicott City at the National Armory on Montgomery Road.
The same year, the state health department ordered the city to stop dumping its raw sewage into the Patuxent River and develop a modern septic system.

In 1964, the Corinthian Conservation Company was proposed to operate a Title I private-nonprofit partnership to implement a slum eradication program in Ellicott City, demolishing residences, and replacing them with 75% federal-funded apartment complexes.

In 1977, the county chose a site outside of the city for a new landfill, leading to the closure of the local New Cut Road landfill which served the county from 1944 until May 1980 for trash and hazardous materials. The New Cut landfill became the Worthington Dog Park. In 2011, a portion of the former landfill site was developed with a $462,000 grant from the Maryland Energy Administration to build onsite solar arrays to power Worthington Elementary.

Ellicott City has historically been home to a population of poverty-class and working-class Appalachian and Southern migrants who came north looking for jobs. Many were factory workers who subsequently worked in the mills of Ellicott City. Many of the Appalachian migrants came from the mountains of Tennessee, earning Ellicott City the nickname &quot;Little Sneedville&quot;, after the town of Sneedville, Tennessee where many of the migrants had come from. By the mid-1980s, the &quot;hillbilly&quot; community had faded. Many of the migrants from Tennessee returned, while others lived in apartments along Route 40. By 1985, Ellicott City had experienced gentrification, becoming associated with antique shopping.

Historic Main Street has been the site of several devastating fires, most notably in November 1984, three in 1992 and again on November 9, 1999. The 1984 fire was started by Leidig&#x27;s Bakery&#x27;s faulty air conditioning unit and destroyed six buildings; the 1992 fires were by arson, and the 1999 six-alarm blaze which destroyed five businesses and caused an estimated $2 million in damage was accidentally started behind a restaurant by a discarded cigarette. 

The fairy tale-themed amusement park, the Enchanted Forest, was located in the western part of the area. The park closed to the general public since the early 1990s. A shopping center (called the Enchanted Forest Shopping Center) was built on its parking lot. Many of the attractions have been moved to Clark&#x27;s Elioak Farm in a rural area in the southwest corner of the Ellicott City CDP, where they are being restored. The Enchanted Forest was featured in the 1990 John Waters-directed film &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;.
At midnight on August 21, 2012, a CSX coal train derailed on the Old Main Line Subdivision. Two 19-year-old girls who were sitting on the railroad bridge over Main Street were killed when coal was dumped on them.

In 2012, the Forest Diner closed, ending a 66-year business as a traditional polished metal roadside diner, making way for 38 apartments.

In 2014, the Hiene House and Ellicott City Jail were placed on the Preserve Howard top-ten most endangered list due to walkway and parking lot construction plans.

In 2015, Ellicott City was inducted as a new member of Tree City USA.
===Koreatown===

Ellicott City has been home to a large Korean population along its Route 40 corridor, where numerous Korean-owned businesses and restaurants operate. Around 12,000 Korean-Americans currently live in Howard County, officials say. In Ellicott City, they make up 24 percent of the population. In 2017, Governor Larry Hogan dedicated a section of Route 40 from Rogers Avenue to Greenway Drive as &quot;Korean Way&quot;, paying homage to the community&#x27;s Korean culture. Ellicott City&#x27;s Koreatown has been widely recognized for revitalizing declining shopping centers along the U.S. highway.

===Floods===
The town is prone to flooding from the Patapsco River and its tributary the Tiber River. These floods have had a major impact on the history of the town, often destroying important businesses and killing many. Ellicott City has had major devastating floods in 1817, 1837, 1868, 1901, 1917, 1923, 1938, 1942, 1952, 1956, 1972 (Hurricane Agnes), 1975 (Hurricane Eloise), 1989, 2011, 2016, and 2018. The 1868 flood washed away 14 houses, killing 39 to 43 (accounts vary) in and around Ellicott City. It wiped out the Granite Manufacturing Cotton Mill, Charles A. Gambrill&#x27;s Patapsco Mill, John Lee Carroll&#x27;s mill buildings, and dozens of homes. One mill was rebuilt by Charles Gambrill, which remained in operation until a fire in 1916.
A 1923 flood topped bridges, in 1952 an wall of water swept the shops of Ellicott City, and a 1956 flood inflicted heavy damage at the Bartigis Brothers plant. On June 21, 1972, the Patapsco River valley flooded from the remnants of Hurricane Agnes, taking out a concrete bridge, destroying the Jonathan Ellicott home, and the 1910 Victor Blode water filtration plant, and flooding Main Street to the Odd Fellows hall. The Old Main Line of the B&amp;O Railroad also sustained serious damage.

On September 27, 1975, the town was flooded from Hurricane Eloise. Floods also occurred September 22, 1989, from Hurricane Hugo, and on September 7, 2011, flooding from Tropical Storm Lee.

==== 2016 flood ====

On July 30, 2016, a storm dropped of rain in two hours on the community. The resulting flash flood caused severe damage in historic Ellicott City, especially along Main Street. Many homes, roads, businesses, sidewalks, and more were destroyed by the flooding, including the town&#x27;s landmark clock. A state of emergency was declared, and two people died as a result of the flooding.

==== 2018 flood ==== 

On the afternoon of May 27, 2018, historic Main Street flooded again, after the region received over eight inches of rain in the span of two hours, just days before the new flood emergency alert system was to become operational. Homes, businesses, and infrastructure, including roads and the town&#x27;s clock, were again damaged or destroyed. One person died, a National Guard member swept away while trying to save others.

====Flood control====
In 2017, the &quot;Ellicott City Watershed Master Plan&quot; was unveiled, but after the 2018 flood, the plans had to be re-evaluated. A $140 million multi-tiered five-year plan was chosen by County officials. The plan includes building a tunnel requiring the removal of nine historic structures.

The removal of the buildings was opposed by preservationists as well as residents and Howard County Executive Calvin Ball. Ball halted the work of Kittleman to study five plans. One would involve removing six buildings and another only four buildings. Two plans called for boring underground tunnels that was considered too expensive.

The plan chosen involves tearing down four buildings and boring a 15-foot diameter tunnel through 1,600 feet of the granite hillside. Ten buildings were purchased and six will be stabilized and restored. The plan was not to solve the flood problem but mitigate it from over four feet to under one foot of flooding on the streets.

The removal and construction work began in January 2024, and was completed in summer 2024. The partial removal and renovation of the other six is still underway as of February 2025.

==Geography==
Ellicott City is in northeastern Howard County, bordered to the east and north by the Patapsco River, which forms the Baltimore County line. The Ellicott City census-designated place (CDP) extends to the northwest beyond Marriottsville Road and to the southwest beyond Centennial Road. It is bordered to the south by Columbia at Maryland Route 108 and to the southeast by Ilchester at Maryland Route 104 and Bonnie Branch Road. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.41%, are water.

Ellicott City is claimed to be built on seven hills. These hills lie southeast of the Historic District, which is in the Tiber River valley immediately west of the Patapsco River. The Tiber River is a small tributary of the Patapsco that forms the narrow valley followed by Main Street. Several deep stream valleys converge at this location, which increases the risk of flooding, but at the same time creates the town&#x27;s heights.

The heart of the Historic District is Main Street, where the oldest structures of the town stand. Smaller neighborhoods within the district include Tonge Row (also spelled Tongue Row) adjacent to Old Columbia Pike, and the West End, at the western end of Main Street.

===Neighborhoods===
The remainder of the Ellicott City CDP (&quot;Greater Ellicott City&quot;) includes the neighborhoods of:

* Oella (Baltimore County)
* Dorsey&#x27;s Search

<text>North Laurel is a census-designated place (CDP) in Howard County, Maryland, United States. The published population was 4,474 at the 2010 census. This population was substantially less than the CDP&#x27;s population in 2000, and was the result of an error in defining the boundary prior to tabulation and publication of 2010 Census results. The corrected 2010 Census population is 20,259. North Laurel is adjacent to the City of Laurel, which is located across the Patuxent River in Prince George&#x27;s County.
==Geography==
North Laurel is located in the southern corner of Howard County at (39.134343, −76.862690). It is bordered to the north by Savage and Columbia, to the west by Scaggsville, to the south in Prince George&#x27;s County by the city of Laurel, and to the southeast in Anne Arundel County by Maryland City. The southern boundary of the CDP is defined by the Patuxent River, which is also the Howard County/Prince George&#x27;s County line.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the North Laurel CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.6%, is water. (these area measurements differ from those initially published by the Census Bureau.

==Demographics==

The North Laurel CDP as defined for the 2010 census was smaller than the CDP that was defined for the 2000 census. In 2010, portions of the earlier North Laurel CDP were split off into the Scaggsville and Fulton CDPs. Demographic figures from the 2000 census are therefore significantly different from the published figures from 2010. The substantially lower population, however, was the result of an error in defining the CDP boundary prior to tabulation and publication of 2010 Census results. The Census Bureau noted the error in its published errata. The corrected counts for North Laurel CDP for 2010 are 20,259 population, 7,593 housing units, and land area of 6.3 square miles. The corrected boundary and population are reflected in subsequent data from the American Community Survey. North Laurel gained territory formerly within the Savage-Guilford CDP for Census 2000, located south of the Little Patuxent and Middle Patuxent Rivers and east of Interstate 95. This territory was the portion defined as North Laurel in official 2010 Census data products.

==History==

===Prehistoric times===

The edge of the Arundel Formation underlies the North Laurel area. The astrodon, a herbivorous sauropod, was present about 112 million years ago. Prior to 10,700 B.C. North Laurel was a spruce forest evolving into a boreal forest occupied by mammals ranging from mastodon to sloth. By 3000 B.C. the vegetation was similar to modern plant life. Humans have lived along the Patuxent River since at least 6500 B.C. By the time of European contact, the lands in the region were occupied by various tribes of Algonquin speaking Native Americans.

===Recent history===
The Patuxent River was first named (&quot;Pawtuxunt&quot;) on the detailed map resulting from the 1608 voyage upriver by Jamestown settler John Smith. The early English settlers progressively explored further northward from the mouth of the river, eventually reaching the area that is now North Laurel. In the 1620s the Susquehannocks pushed the Piscataway tribes out to the southeast to reduce competition occupying the area as far south as the Potomac River. The Susquehannocks were well armed hunters and profited from beaver trading with the English. By 1632 Lord Baltimore had claimed title to issue land grants in Maryland through Charles I of England. In 1652, the Susquehannocks made a treaty with Marylanders to keep trade flowing and receive arms to use against the Iroquois to the north. By 1675, efforts were underway to eliminate the Susquehannocks from the region.

The North Laurel region was surveyed into land grants with colorful names in the mid-1700s. The largest grant was Warfield&#x27;s Range, followed by Wincopion Neck. Smaller grants in the area include (from north to south) The Addition, Ridgley&#x27;s Neck, Bare Hills, Poplar Range, Grover&#x27;s Lot, Poplar Bottom, Holland&#x27;s Chance, Snowden&#x27;s Intent, Clark&#x27;s Walks, Snowden&#x27;s New Birmingham, Brother&#x27;s Partnership, Warfields Neglect, Sappington&#x27;s Sweep, Nellsons Rainbow, Lasswells Hopewell, and Davis&#x27;s Hills. The oldest structure in Howard County was situated on Warfield&#x27;s Range. The log cabin built in 1696 was moved to Elkridge to accommodate a Newburn development, and was destroyed by arson. The post road from Washington to Baltimore was constructed in 1740, which ran along its eastern boundary. Used by George Washington regularly, the road would remain the principle route between Baltimore and Washington for 200 years.

By the 1800s tobacco farming was the primary crop in North Laurel. Soil conservation was poor, leaving farms to switch crops or abandon farms. The founding of the Laurel grist mill in 1811 and the Savage Mill in 1822 brought an industrial economy to the area. Slavery was a common practice among the farmers in North Laurel until after emancipation. Runaway slave ads were regularly placed in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; newspaper.

In the summer of 1834, Irish (Corkians) and German (Fardown) workers clashed at the B&amp;O construction site at North Laurel. Fardowns burned shanties used by Corkian workers. A militia of 60 men were led by General Ridgley to keep the peace between the rival factions. In 1835 the rail line between Baltimore and Washington was completed next to the post road.

North Laurel was located in Anne Arundel County until 1860, when it became part of the newly subdivided Howard County.

In 1890, a syndicate purchased portions of the Burr, Brightwood, Kennedy, and Wheeler farms next to the B&amp;O track to form a town named &quot;North Laurel&quot; adjacent, which did not materialize. The Patuxent Springs became a small tourist destination at the turn of the century.

In 1901, Ernest Lyon founded the Maryland Industrial and Agricultural Institute for Colored Youths near the Patuxent River to serve African Americans during the era of racial segregation in the United States.
In 1910, the Southern Real Estate Company of Pittsburgh bought one of Gustuavas Ober&#x27;s North Laurel farms totaling for $70,000. The lots were subdivided to form Laurel Park. Many of the lots remained undeveloped for over 100 years. Several remaining lots were purchased with eminent domain and exchanged with Cornerstone Homes to consolidate enough land to build the North Laurel Civic Center and park. In 2013, Howard County sold the remaining wooded lots on the parkland to build Park Overlook.

The next year, Senator Arthur Pue Gorman&#x27;s daughter, Grace &quot;Daisy&quot;, built her home, Overlook, on of land along Murray Hill Road inherited from her father. Her husband, R.W. Johnson, was the first manager of the Laurel race track. The property was the home to land developer and ambassador Kingdon Gould Jr. from 1952.

In 1948, police raided Rocway Towers, putting an end to a short-lived effort to bring Washington-funded gambling casinos to Laurel. The Stucco Roadhouse built in the 1920s to resemble a mission house was the site of a 1948 gangland murder and prostitution into the 1970s. It remains in operation today as a used car dealership. The same year, Freestate Raceway, a second racetrack featuring harness racing, was opened.

In 1959 the plan was announced that Interstate 95 would be built through the farms of eastern Howard County. In October 1962, were rezoned for apartments at the corner of Whiskey Bottom Road and All Saints Road to take advantage of the future highway exit in North Laurel. An additional of land was given to the county in school exchange for approving such a dense development. To the north, school board member Rob Moxley was secretly buying and swapping of farmland for Howard Research and Development to build Columbia. On 21 September 1963, the Laurel Planning and Redevelopment Corporation took out $520,000 in loans to buy of the land to build Whiskey Bottom Apartments, which was resold to Whiskey Bottom Properties in 1966 for $1,000,000. The loan officer Ralph Lublow was tried for taking secret bonuses for the project, and in 1978 was released due to insanity after ordering hitmen to murder fellow businessmen Morton Hollander and Alvin Blum. On June 17, 1964, the Howard County Public School system applied for a P.L. 815 federal loan intended to fund schools for the children of federal workers that were being relocated to support Cold-War buildups. The project that would support the rapid population increase from the Whiskey Bottom development would become Whiskey Bottom Road Elementary School.

By 1963, the county anticipated growth from 44,000 to nearly 260,000 by the year 2000 (a mark reached by 2004). It also anticipated that despite the massive growth in population from the new 100,000-person &quot;planned city&quot; of Columbia, the Sixth Election District would be the most populated section of Howard County after 1975.

In 1991, Freestate Racetrack was targeted for development. The Coca-Cola company sought the site for a bottling plant that was eventually built in Hanover, Maryland. On 8 September 1992, a man and a teenager attempted a series of failed carjackings starting at the southbound rest stop at I-95 through the Bolling Brook subdivisions. The men carjacked the vehicle of Dr. Pam Basu and her 22-month-old daughter at a stop at Horsham and Kightsbridge road. Basu attempted to retrieve her daughter, and was dragged to death along Gorman Road. The suspects were caught in western Howard County after a police chase. As a direct result of the violent incident, the Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 (FACTA) was created, the first federal carjacking law. The 1992 act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2119, took effect on October 25, 1992.

Prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks, all five of the hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77 (which crashed into the Pentagon) stayed at various motels in North Laurel, including the Budget Host Valencia and Pin-Del motels in Howard County. The wing of the Valencia where they stayed was demolished, and a new Sleep Inn was constructed on the ground, which opened in April 2007.

In 2006, the Rouse Company developed luxury townhomes at Stone Lake, a former quarry. The quarry was trash dump in the 1950s and closed in 1973. In 1976, Rouse proposed using the site for the profitable commercial landfill operations requiring dumping fees in competition with the Alpha Ridge Landfill. The site filled with rain and groundwater becoming the location of multiple drownings.

<text>Betterton is a town in Kent County, Maryland, United States. The population was 345 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Betterton is located at the mouth of the Sassafras River on the upper Chesapeake Bay in Kent County, Maryland, on the Eastern Shore region of the Bay and Delmarva Peninsula in the Eastern United States). The GPS coordinates are (39.367863, -76.060877).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Betterton Historic District==
The Betterton Historic District consists of a collection of vernacular Victorian era-style wooden frame resort structures. The district includes many of the homes, hotels and cottages built to accommodate steamboat passengers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Notable buildings within the district include the hotels and boarding homes which catered to the steamboat passengers, several churches, and summer cottages, dating from the golden age of the passenger steamboats on the Chesapeake Bay.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places, (maintained by the National Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior) in 1984.

==History==
The recorded history of Betterton dates back to the 17th century. The Fishall Patent was granted in 1664, later becoming known as Fish Hall. The house located at 104 Ericsson Avenue contains foundation bricks dating back to 1698. In 1715, Edward Crew leased Fish Hall and the name was changed to Crews Landing.
For the next 100 years, Crews Landing was a small fishing village and then later a port for the waterborne transport of local farm produce to urban markets. In 1851, Richard Townsend Turner (a Quaker) named the town “Betterton” after the family of his wife Elizabeth Betterton. The Turner pier, and later the Ericsson pier, provided access to the town for the shipping trade. Eventually townspeople rented out rooms to the travelers, salesmen, and shippers attracted to the beach. Mr. Turner built the Rigbie Hotel (demolished in August 1986) and Mr. Crownhart built the Belmont Hotel (destroyed by fire in 1956). These were joined by such lodging establishments as the Betterton, the Chesapeake, the Country Cousin, the Southern, and many others.

Steamboat traffic from downtown Baltimore&#x27;s &quot;The Basin&quot; (now Inner Harbor) and Philadelphia on the excursion cruises like the Old Bay Line (Baltimore Steam Packet Company, 1840-1962) and the competing Ericsson Line (and others, such as the Wilson Line later) brought the visitors and vacationers from the Middle Atlantic cities. The Ericsson Line was named after John Ericsson (1803-1889), the Swedish-American inventor of the &quot;screw propeller&quot; (and of Civil War revolutionary naval Ironclad warships) to more speedily and efficiently power ships. It was this invention that allowed steamboats to be built with narrow enough beam to allow them to traverse the recently opened Chesapeake and Delaware Canal then only 25 feet wide (before it was later widened and improved), connecting the upper Chesapeake with the Delaware River and Bay. Betterton was an easy and natural stop for boats using the canal and the explosion in steamboat traffic along the American East Coast brought growth and prosperity to Betterton. For some time before the turn of the 20th century, there were 11 scheduled steamboat landings daily at Betterton&#x27;s piers. The boom period for Betterton is generally thought to be from 1918 to 1930, when increasing numbers of restaurants, taverns, dance halls, bowling alleys, and amusement arcades all helped create the bayside town&#x27;s pleasure resort image.

It eventually declined along with neighboring competing Tolchester and Tolchester Beach after the 1949-1952 construction of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from Annapolis to Kent Island and increasing automobile traffic over improved U.S. Routes and Interstate Highways systems in following decades to North Atlantic Ocean beaches and growing resort towns there like Ocean City, Maryland and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware
==Government==
Betterton is governed by a mayor and a town council with four members. Town council meetings are held on the second and fourth Tuesday of every month at 7:00 pm in the town hall. The town hall is located in the Betterton Community Center, a former Catholic church refurbished as town offices and a museum, on Main Street.

==Transportation==
The primary means of travel to and from Betterton is by road. The only state highway serving the town is Maryland Route 292, which has its northern terminus at the north end of town.

==Betterton Beach==
Betterton Beach is located at the foot of Main Street. The beach has of frontage for swimming. The water is generally free of sea nettles because the water is not very salty. The beach has public restrooms (seasonal), a boardwalk, a fishing jetty, a public landing, and reasonable parking. A picnic pavilion is nearby.

<text>Chestertown is a town in Kent County, Maryland, United States. The population was 5,532 as of the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Kent County, the oldest county in Maryland.

== History ==

Founded in 1706, Chestertown rose in stature when it was named one of the English colony of Maryland&#x27;s six &quot;Royal Ports of Entry&quot;. The shipping boom that followed this designation made the town at the navigable head of the Chester River wealthy. In the mid-eighteenth century, Chestertown trailed only Annapolis and was considered Maryland&#x27;s second leading port.

A burgeoning merchant class infused riches into the town, reflected in the many brick mansions and townhouses that sprang up along the waterfront. Another area in which Chestertown is second only to Annapolis is in its number of existing eighteenth century homes.

As of the 1790 census, Chestertown was the geographical center of population of the United States.

Chestertown was incorporated in 1805, and was named for the Chester River.

The town is noted for its abundance of historic properties.

==Arts and culture==
=== Chestertown Tea Party Festival ===

In May 1774, five months after the British closing the port of Boston after the Boston Tea Party, the citizens of Chestertown wrote a set of resolves that prohibited the buying, selling, or drinking of tea. Based on these resolutions, a popular legend has it that the citizens held their own &quot;tea party&quot; on the Chester River in an act of colonial defiance.

The Chestertown Tea Party Festival celebrates Chestertown&#x27;s colonial heritage with a weekend of events on Memorial Day weekend, including a re-enactment of the legendary &quot;tea party.&quot; A parade begins the festival, marching down High Street to the Chester River, and then follows with colonial music and dance, fife and drum performances, puppet shows, colonial crafts demonstrations and sales, military drills, and a walking tour of the historic district. In the afternoon, re-enactors, playing the part of angry citizens and Continental Soldiers, march to the docks where redcoats (played by members of the Maryland Loyalist Battalion) defend the ship for a short skirmish, then retire. The ship, the schooner &quot;Sultana&quot;, is then boarded by the angry citizens, and the tea is thrown into the Chester River.

=== Schooner &quot;Sultana&quot; ===
In 1997, John Swain came up with blueprints for a reproduction of the American-built yacht, later Royal Navy schooner , planning the construction and home of the ship to be centered in Chestertown. In the same year the non-profit group Sultana Projects, Inc. was formed by Swain and supporters to fund construction of the ship. A shipyard was constructed and the keel for the &quot;Sultana&quot; was laid in October 1998. Over 3,000 students participated in the community and educationally led effort, with a core group of volunteers logging over 150,000 hours of time building the ship. Over 10,000 people were at the launching of the ship in March 2001, and since then more than 8,000 students a year have boarded the &quot;Sultana&quot; for educational trips. The &quot;Sultana&quot; also plays a key role in the Chestertown Tea Party, as it is now the official boat of the staged re-enactment. The Schooner Sultana website offers more detailed information on the ship.

=== Honors and accolades ===
The National Trust for Historic Preservation, the country&#x27;s largest private, nonprofit preservation organization, named Chestertown, Maryland, to its 2007 list of &quot;America&#x27;s Dozen Distinctive Destinations&quot;, an annual list of unique and lovingly preserved communities in the United States. Chestertown was selected from 63 destinations in 27 states that were nominated by individuals, preservation organizations, and local communities.

In 2008, &quot;Progressive Farmer&quot; magazine honored Kent County and Chestertown by naming it #1 in &quot;Best Rural Places to Live in America&quot;. &quot;For a county to be in Progressive Farmer&#x27;s Best Places list, they hold them to the usual standards — good schools, health care, safety and other desirable qualities. But what makes Kent stand out is its residents&#x27; resolve to maintain a solid rural heritage.&quot;

=== First Friday ===
On the first Friday of each month, Chestertown residents, as well as neighboring towns&#x27; residents make their way down to Chestertown&#x27;s main street. Many shops open their doors to visitors and put their merchandise on display. This event draws many people from the surrounding town area, as well as many students from Washington College.

The former Chestertown High School moved from its original 1915 building in 1953. In 1971 Kent County High opened and the former Chestertown High became Chestertown Middle School. The middle school became the consolidated Kent County Middle in 2010.

<text>Rock Hall, is a waterfront town located directly on the National Chesapeake Scenic Byway in Kent County, Maryland, United States. The population was 1,310 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Originally called Rock Hall Crossroads, the city is now a fishing, sailing and recreational boating town situated on the upper Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. It is the center of Kent County&#x27;s maritime industries, and is also a popular tourist destination. It was established in 1707. The city was named for a mansion made of white sandstone, and was incorporated in 1908.

Rock Hall served as a shipping point for tobacco, seafood and other agricultural products, as well as a passenger transport connection for travelers during the Colonial era. Later, fishing and seafood processing became the town&#x27;s largest industry.

The town missed out on receiving a railroad connection in 1872, when the Kent County Railroad set out to build from Massey via Chestertown and connect with a ferry to Baltimore for both passengers and freight. The company went bankrupt in 1877, having only built a stub from Chestertown to a place called Belair or Parsons and abandoning the rest unfinished.

Rock Hall Harbor remains a working harbor with an active fleet of commercial watermen, charter fishing and commercial sailing boats. It has three museums including a waterman&#x27;s museum.

Hinchingham and Trumpington are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

During the American Civil War, Brookeville, along with nearby Sandy Spring, was a stop on the Underground Railroad.

==Overview==
The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) defines a larger area as Brookeville than what falls within the town boundaries. This includes areas extending to the Patuxent River and the Howard County border, and including the small hamlets of Sunshine and Brighton. Reddy Branch Stream Valley Park surrounds the Town of Brookeville, with the creek flowing west to east towards the Patuxent. Other parks and recreational areas include Rachel Carson Conservation Park, Patuxent River State Park, and the Triadelphia Reservoir. Areas to the north of Brookeville in Howard County and Carroll County have also experienced rapid population growth. Georgia Avenue carries a substantial volume of traffic through the town, from these areas to the north into Montgomery County and Washington, D.C. In 1966, county planning officials recommended that a bypass be built to carry commuters around the town. The project was under construction as of 2022.

Brookeville is an affluent residential community, with a large portion of residents employed with the government or related professional jobs. The town is governed by a three-person town commission, while surrounding unincorporated areas are administered by the county. Historically, the Brookeville Academy was an important educational institution for the community. In 1883, Sherwood High School opened as a Friends school and became a public school in 1909, serving Brookeville and other nearby areas.

==History==
Quakers Richard Thomas and his wife Deborah Brooke founded the town of Brookeville in 1794, and named it after her family. The town was established on land inherited by Deborah Brooke from her father Roger Brooke IV, son of an influential Quaker landholder, James Brooke. At the time, Brooke was the largest landholder in what would become Montgomery County. Thomas set up a mill, along the Reddy Branch, which forms the northern border of the town. Caleb Bentley opened a store and a post office in 1802, becoming the first postmaster of Brookeville. The town&#x27;s charter was approved in 1808, though not formally issued until 1890.

Brookeville served as a market town for the agriculture industry in the surrounding area. During the 19th century, Brookeville was home to several mills, the Brookeville Academy (initially a boys&#x27; school), a post office, a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Salem Methodist Protestant Church, and a number of shops. Newlin&#x27;s Mill, located on the west side of town, processed high-quality castor oil and ground limestone for plaster. Thomas Mill was located on the east side of town. To transport goods more easily to markets in Washington, D.C., a prosperous farmer established a company in 1849 to build a toll road to connect Brookeville to the Seventh Street Pike. The turnpike was sold to the state of Maryland in 1914, and later became Georgia Avenue, now Maryland Route 97.

Brookeville was home to Thomas Moore Jr., who along with Caleb Bentley was instrumental in the creation of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Moore is also credited as the inventor of the first refrigerator, and coining the term. He created a portable contraption to transport butter and other products to sell at markets in Washington. His products commanded a high price, due to the extra freshness of the products at the market. Moore lived near the town, at Longwood Manor, which was built in 1817.

===War of 1812===
During the War of 1812, when the British burned parts of Washington, D.C., the federal government and troops fled the capital. President James Madison first fled to Virginia, but then turned north. He arrived in Rockville at 6 p.m. on August 26, 1814, expecting to find General William H. Winder and his troops. They had already proceeded on towards Baltimore, however. Madison continued eastward and arrived in Brookeville on horseback. He reportedly carried with him a strongbox, which contained the entire U.S. treasury. On the night of August 26, he stayed in the home of Caleb Bentley, whose wife Henrietta Thomas was close friends with Dolley Madison.

Madison stayed up all night, dispatching orders, while soldiers remained on guard outside. After the British left Washington, they sailed to nearby Baltimore, where they attacked Fort McHenry and were repulsed. Upon hearing that news, Madison returned to Washington. Madison wrote a note to his wife that morning.

===Late 19th century===

The Oakley Farm, located on the western edge of Brookeville, thrived during the 18th and 19th centuries. Log cabins, dating from the 1820s, were built on the Oakley/Dorsey farm, to house slaves and later free black families. The Oakley Cabin is now maintained by the Montgomery County Department of Parks. A number of other 18th and 19th century cabins still exist on private property in the Brookeville area.

During the American Civil War, George B. McClellan sent Union troops (the First and Ninth Corps) through Brookeville, on their way to Antietam. This was one of three groups of troops that came from different directions towards Antietam. The Quakers played an instrumental role in aiding escaped slaves on the Underground Railroad. Nearby Sandy Spring was an important stop. Historians suggest that the Madison House was also used as a stop on the Underground Railroad during the Civil War. Part of the Madison House once served as the town&#x27;s post office. A false stone wall in the room hid a staircase that descended in two directions, including into a hidden area in the basement where escaped slaves could hide.

===20th century===
In 1910, the Salem United Methodist Church was built to replace a church that had been destroyed by fire, and the church cemetery has been there since the mid-19th century. By 1900, the mills and shops had shut down, and Brookeville remained a residential town. In 1915, the Bentley family sold the Madison House to Roger Brooke, a leader of the Quaker community. The house later changed hands, owned for some time by Elisha Hall, a principal at the Brookeville Academy, banker Remus Riggs, and Gene Archer, an NBC television personality.

The automobile gave people more mobility and changed the market, with the nearby town of Olney taking prominence over Brookeville. Since the 1950s, Olney has rapidly developed, putting pressure on Brookeville. The Brookeville Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Brookeville&#x27;s historic designation has helped it retain historic character.

==Geography==

Brookeville is located in northeastern Montgomery County, Maryland, west of the Patuxent River and the Howard County border. The town is north of Olney and north of downtown Washington, D.C. The Town of Brookeville is formally incorporated, and covers an area of . Areas beyond the formal town boundaries, extending to the Howard County boundary, use Brookeville mailing addresses, falling within the 20833 ZIP Code. Located within the ZIP Code are the small hamlets of Sunshine and Brighton. Georgia Avenue (Maryland Route 97), which is a major north–south route through this part of Maryland, passes through the town. Brookeville Road connects the town with Laytonsville and other areas to the west. Brighton Dam Road extends to the east, crossing New Hampshire Avenue (Maryland Route 650), then the Patuxent River, and into Howard County.

Georgia Avenue, which begins in Washington, D.C., is a two-lane road when it passes through Brookeville, with a stop sign and tight turn that takes it through the historic district. In 1989, the road carried 8,000 vehicles daily, a number which had increased to 18,000 vehicles each weekday as of 2007. The traffic mainly consists of commuters from Carroll County and Howard County. The traffic volume on Georgia Avenue is more than the road was designed to handle. Brookeville residents have advocated for a bypass road to be constructed, to take traffic around the town. The bypass road around the town was in the planning stages for some time, since being recommended by county planning officials in 1966. The bypass road will include two roundabouts, one on either side of the town. The project was under construction as of May 2019 and was nearly complete by the fall of 2022.

Reddy Branch flows along the northern and eastern edges of the town. It is a tributary of the Hawlings River, which flows east to the Patuxent River downstream from the Triadelphia Reservoir. Reddy Branch Stream Valley Park is located along Brookeville Road, to the west of the town, and to the east along Brighton Dam Road. Hawling Hills Park and Patuxent River State Park are located along New Hampshire Avenue, north of Ashton and to the east of Brookeville. Patuxent River State Park is used for hunting, fishing, hiking and horseback riding. Rachel Carson Conservation Park, located to the north, is undeveloped and has a number of hiking trails. The Triadelphia Reservoir, created by the Brighton Dam, is located on the Patuxent River. The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission maintains , in and around the reservoir, which are open to the public for recreational purposes. The reservoir is a popular recreation spot that is suitable for fishing, kayaking, and other activities. Mount Zion Park is a small park with playgrounds, ball fields, tennis courts, and picnic facilities. Within the town limits, Powers&#x27; Woods Park is a new park that is slated to be located near a recently restored one-room schoolhouse.

Among those educated at the Academy, include Dr. Henry Howard, who established Howard County, and William Edward Magruder, great-grandson of Colonel Zadok Magruder. In 1869, the Brookeville Academy relocated to Merrywood, located on nearby farmland outside of town. The original building has since been used as a meeting facility by the American Legion and other organizations. On June 2, 1909, the Public School Board took over running the school. In 1988, the original building was sold to the Town of Brookeville, which maintains the building as a historic site and use for events.

<text>Cabin John is a census-designated place and unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 2,459. Overlooking the Potomac River, it is a suburb of Washington, D.C.

==History==
Early land records in 1715 cite Captain John&#x27;s Run, now called Cabin John Creek. The toponym &quot;Cabin John&quot; is thought to be a corruption of the name &quot;Captain John&quot;, but the origin of the name remains unresolved.

Cabin John is the location of the Union Arch Bridge, built between 1857 and 1864 over Cabin John Creek; at the time of its completion, the bridge embodied the longest single-span masonry arch in the world and remains the longest in the United States. The Cabin John Bridge Hotel was built in 1870 adjacent to the west end of the Union Arch Bridge, overlooking the Potomac. Originally a refreshment stand and boarding house for bridge workers, it grew into &quot;a sumptuous establishment frequented by the most powerful politicians and important social figures of Washington, D.C.&quot; In its heydays of the 1890s to early 1900s, &quot;the hotel was so lavish and became so important a destination for Washingtonians that &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported about it regularly.&quot; The hotel was destroyed by fire in 1931.

The neighborhood was connected by streetcar to Georgetown from 1897 to the 1930s and to Bethesda, Maryland, from about 1900. Streetcar service ended c. 1960.

Bordering Cabin John to the west is Carderock, where in 1936–1939 the U.S. Navy built the David Taylor Model Basin, one of the largest test facilities for ship design in the world. The test basin facility was originally planned for Cabin John, but instead the original site, bought from Mary Ellen Bobinger, widow of the owner of the Cabin John Hotel, was used to build housing for workmen. &quot;The Navy had 125 homes constructed… 100 for white workers and 25 for black.&quot; The homes were in two small neighborhoods, Cabin John Gardens, off MacArthur Boulevard, and Carver Road, off Seven Locks Road. The Cabin John Gardens homes were constructed on the site of the former hotel and sold by the government to employees, with the land itself held as a cooperative—the only single-family development of its kind in the county. Carver Road homes were located about 1/3 of a mile to the northwest and originally rented out for $28 a month. &quot;Of the families who moved there, many are still there, as adult children and grandchildren stayed on.&quot;

Before the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, racial covenants were used to exclude African Americans and other people of color. For example, a 1924 deed for a property owned by the American Land Company, Inc., of J. S. Tomlinson said, &quot;That no part of said property shall be sold leased, rented or deed to any person or persons of the negro race or other persons of color.&quot;

==Geography==
Cabin John is in southern Montgomery County, less than northwest of the border of the District of Columbia, and bordered to the south by the Potomac River and the state of Virginia. It contains a section of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&amp;O), including locks 8 through 12. The community is the access point to Plummers Island in the Potomac, originally owned by the Washington Biologists&#x27; Field Club and called &quot;the most thoroughly studied island in North America.&quot;

As an unincorporated area, Cabin John&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined. Cabin John is, however, recognized by the United States Census Bureau as a census-designated place, and by the United States Geological Survey as a populated place located at (38.975110, −77.159281). The CDP borders are the Capital Beltway (I-495) to the west and north, Cabin John Parkway to the northeast, and the Maryland–Virginia state line to the south, along the south shore of the Potomac River. The Clara Barton Parkway parallels the Potomac and the C&amp;O Canal, leading southeast into Washington. Downtown is to the southeast.

According to the census bureau, the Cabin John CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 26.51%, are water.

Before the construction of the Cabin John Parkway in the mid-1960s, the area was considered to extend north to River Road (Maryland Route 190). The Cabin John Parkway is a spur road that connects the Clara Barton Parkway to the Capital Beltway following the Cabin John Creek valley and passing under the Union Arch Bridge. Originally, the banks of the creek nearly reached the full width of the arch, but the parkway required about half the creek&#x27;s width be converted into roadway.

Historically, Cabin John has been part of the region known as the Potomac Gorge (Potomac Palisades), an approximately corridor or &quot;fall zone&quot; that sees a transition between the hard bedrock of the Piedmont to the softer rocks and soils of the Atlantic Coastal Plain and representing a drop in elevation from to about above sea level.

<text>Clarksburg is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area in northern Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It is located at the northern end of the Interstate 270 technology corridor, approximately four miles north of Germantown. As of the 2020 census, Clarksburg had a population of 29,051.

==History==
Clarksburg is named for trader John Clarke, and was established at the intersection of the main road between Georgetown and Frederick and an old Seneca trail. One of its earliest white inhabitants was a man named Michael Ashford Dowden, who in 1752 received a patent for from the colonial government called &quot;Hammer Hill&quot;, and two years later permission to build an inn. The inn itself is a footnote in history, hosting the army of General Edward Braddock during the French and Indian War, serving as a meeting place for local Sons of Liberty in the years before the American Revolution, and possibly serving dinner to President Andrew Jackson on his way to his inauguration. Jamie, grandson of the trader, built a general store in the area around 1770, and over the next thirty years enough people moved to the area that Clark was appointed postmaster for the community. By 1875, Clarksburg was a major town in the northern part of the county, but the construction of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad undermined its economy.

In 1964, the Montgomery County planning commission decided that Clarksburg would be the last community along Interstate 270 that would have large-scale development. The Montgomery County Council adopted a master plan for Clarksburg in 1968, which rezoned land for a mix of townhouses and single-family houses. Another master plan was adopted in 1994. This master plan set forth the areas to be developed, with targets for housing, retail, employment and transit. A network of roads and infrastructure was mapped out to handle the growth expected as the town grew to 40,000 residents. The center of this plan is the Town Center District, which contains a retail area connected to the historic town business district. It was planned to be built early on, but had not broken ground by 2010, to the dismay of some residents. A Harris Teeter-anchored shopping center opened in 2013, and a large mall called Clarksburg Premium Outlets opened in October 2016. The shopping complex has over 90 stores and provides jobs for the region.

In June 2015, the Clarksburg Chamber of Commerce held a contest and chose a flag designed by Shaneea Peek. The inspiration of the flag was derived from Dowden&#x27;s Ordinary which is a historic landmark of the community of Clarksburg.

=== Development ===

Since 2000, there has been major growth in the area of Clarksburg. A new town center is being built in the heart of Clarksburg, near the historic center. 2010 Census data showed that over 13,677 residents and 4,352 households resided in Clarksburg, which consisted of a diverse population with a high level of education attainment. Several public parks and schools have been built to help accommodate the growth.

==== Zoning violations ====
During the boom growth period it was discovered that some of the new houses were built closer together than the minimum distance required by zoning laws, with roads built too narrow for fire trucks to pass, and homes and community facilities built without adequate permits or approvals by the county government. This was found to be the fault of inadequate county oversight and lax enforcement of building codes and laws combined with a building boom in the early 2000s.

==== Environmental impacts ====
In April 2014, the Montgomery County Council set additional limits on development projects in order to protect the quality of nearby Tenmile Creek, a drinking water source and emergency water supply for the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area. Later that year, developers filed suit against the county, claiming that the county &quot;illegally limited construction on its property.&quot; The U.S. District Court in Maryland dismissed the suit in August 2017. The district court&#x27;s dismissal was affirmed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on November 29, 2018.

<text>Colesville is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It had a population of 15,421 as of the 2020 census.

==Geography==
As an unincorporated area, Colesville&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined. Many residents consider the town to be one of the many neighborhoods of Silver Spring. Colesville is recognized by USPS as an acceptable city name in two northeastern Montgomery County ZIP codes, with Silver Spring being the preferred city name. It is also recognized by the United States Census Bureau as a census-designated place, and by the United States Geological Survey as a populated place.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the place has a total area of , all land.

Colesville&#x27;s generally accepted boundaries extend between the Northwest and Paint Branches of the Anacostia River. Its northern and southern boundaries are not as well-defined, but are usually assumed to run from Springbrook High School in the south to Cloverly in the north.

==History==
The first land was purchased in Colesville from the Lords Baltimore in 1714, when Archibald Edmonston patented &quot;Easy Purchase&quot;, a tract that extended from Meadowood south to near present-day Route 29. In 1715, &quot;Easy Purchase&quot; was bought by James Beall Sr., who that year also patented &quot;Drumeldry&quot;, a tract from the Northwest Branch across Notley Road to Shannon Drive. In 1718, his nephew William Beall patented &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Den&quot;, a tract that straddled today&#x27;s Bonifant Road and ran from Notley Road to Pebblestone Drive, and then southwest across the Northwest Branch.

However, none of these early landowners actually resided in Colesville. Robert Lazenby, thought to be the son of Henry Lazenby, High Sheriff of Anne Arundel County, purchased of the southern part of &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Den&quot; from William Beall in 1723, and became the first resident farmer in Colesville.

In 1747, James Odell, grandson of James Beall Sr., was deeded of a tract known as &quot;Beal Christie&quot; from his parents, and took to farming it. It was located east of today&#x27;s New Hampshire Avenue near where it crosses Randolph Road.

In the 1790s, Peter Kemp built a saw and grist mill on Paint Branch where it is crossed by today&#x27;s Randolph Road. The mill was rebuilt twice, and what is seen today in Valley Mill Park is the 1879 mill built by Franklin Pilling, which ceased to operate by 1930.

The earliest recorded use of the &quot;Colesville&quot; name was on January 25, 1806, when the General Assembly of Maryland changed the place of holding elections of the Fourth Election District of Montgomery County to &quot;Edward Berry&#x27;s, commonly called Coale&#x27;s-Ville&quot;. It is unknown where this name came from, but it may have come from the maiden name of Elizabeth (Coale) Snowden, wife of Richard Snowden who was the owner of &quot;Snowden&#x27;s Manor&quot; in nearby Sandy Spring and began living there in 1728. By 1824 the name was generally known as &quot;Coalsville&quot;, and was sometimes referred to as such even as late as 1906.
The oldest standing house in Colesville is &quot;Milimar&quot; at 410 Randolph Road, which is in the National Register of Historic Places and was built around 1790. It is also known as &quot;The Old Lazanby Home&quot;, but was probably built by Samuel and Mary Peach, who purchased the tract it is on known as &quot;Peaches Lot&quot; from Evan Thomas shortly after he freed his slaves.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that President Franklin Pierce purchased a farm of in Colesville in 1855.

Joseph F. Burr started purchasing Colesville-area land in 1869. By 1872, he had amassed nearly and lived in a beautiful mansion on the property known as Valley View. The mansion was located on the north side of today&#x27;s Randolph Road, on the site of today&#x27;s Holy Family Seminary. Burr was a friend of President Grover Cleveland, who visited Valley View frequently.

An old house built in 1850 is still standing at 13910 Notley Road. It was used as a school by a Miss Laxbenny in the late 1800s and was known as &quot;Drumeldra&quot;.

In 1927, the Smithville Colored School was founded in Colesville. It was one of sixteen schools for African Americans constructed in the county with financial assistance from the Julius Rosenwald Fund. It was closed in 1952 when all Montgomery County schools for &quot;colored&quot; children were consolidated.

Colesville United Methodist Church is located in Colesville, Maryland.

The Holy Family Seminary, headquarters of the American Delegation of the catholic order of the Sons of the Holy Family, is also located in Colesville, since 1946.

Colesville hosted the Strawberry Festival every May for over 25 years, ending in 2011. The festival was located at the corner of Hobbes Drive and New Hampshire Avenue. Vendors sold strawberries and ice cream, and volunteers organized carnival games for kids.

<text>Damascus is a census-designated place and an unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. In the early 20th century, there existed an incorporated municipality lasting a quarter century. It had a population of 17,224 as of the 2020 census. Damascus is located at the intersection of three major roads in upper Montgomery County: Ridge Road (currently Rt. 27), Damascus Road (currently Rt. 108) and Woodfield Road (currently Rt. 124).

==Name==
The name was first used in an official document in 1816, when the United States Congress approved a postal route through the area, operated by Edward Hughes.

== History ==
The area currently known as Damascus was granted by the new U.S. state of Maryland to Nathaniel Pigman in 1783. On February 14, 1819, War of 1812 veteran Edward Hughes bought a section of the grant and began subdividing lots for sale. James Madison, the fourth U.S. president, appointed Hughes postmaster of the developing community of Damascus in 1816. Hughes received permission from Congress for a postal route through the town. Hughes called his town &quot;The Pleasant Plains of Damascus&quot; after Damascus, Syria. A newspaper in Frederick wrote of Hughes&#x27;s growing town: &quot;There is at this place an extensive opening for mechanics of all the different kinds, and it bids fair to improve very fast; ... There is at present two blacksmith shops, a saddler&#x27;s shop and a store in the place -- a tailor, a wheel wright, and a shoemaker are much wanted, and would meet with great encouragement.&quot; This was the Damascus of 1816. The new township drew settlers from Anne Arundel County as well as from Montgomery County. On September 12, 1862, U.S. Army troops marched through the &quot;village&quot; of Damascus via what is now Route 27 on their way to the town of Sharpsburg, where they engaged Confederate troops commanded by General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Antietam.

The town was incorporated from 1890 until 1914, when the townspeople requested the incorporation be withdrawn so that Old Quaker Road, used since Revolutionary times and before, could be paved into a state highway. The town remains a commercial center for rural communities like Clagettsville, Browningsville, Cedar Grove, Woodfield, King&#x27;s Valley, Purdum, and Lewisdale, although it is more developed today.

In spite of spiraling population growth and encroaching urban development, old-timers feel like Damascus retains its rural, small-town character. The Damascus Community Fair—a fully agricultural fair that has been in operation since 1940—attracts thousands of visitors annually in the first weekend of September. 4-H clubs and equestrian centers have retained their popularity in the area.

November 17, 2009, marked the grand opening of the Damascus Heritage Society Museum.

Damascus was Maryland&#x27;s last dry town until 2013, when townspeople passed a bill by referendum to allow the sale of beer and wine.

In 2017, Damascus parents and teachers raised funds to paint the town&#x27;s water tower with the green-and-gold &quot;D&quot; logo displayed on the high school football helmets, as a way to honor the prestigious football team and turn the formerly plain-looking tower into an iconic town landmark. The tower can be seen from all around Damascus, and from the high school football field. Initially, the organizers planned to use the school&#x27;s Swarmin&#x27; Hornet mascot, but Georgia Tech did not allow them to because of its similarity to their trademarked yellow-jacket logo.

==Geography==
As an unincorporated area, Damascus&#x27; boundaries are not officially defined. Damascus is recognized by the United States Census Bureau as a census-designated place, and by the United States Geological Survey as a populated place located. Damascus proper is a locally high spot at 847 ft (258m) above sea level, while other portions of the area described as Damascus are as high as 866 ft (264m) above sea level. Due to a quirk in the layout of Montgomery County, the highest elevation in the county is actually within what is considered Mt. Airy, MD, measuring 883 ft (269m) above sea level at the Full Gospel Church. This peak just southwest of Mt. Airy is actually the highest elevation in the immediately adjacent Washington D.C. suburbs and is located inside an often overlooked strip of Montgomery County which is approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) long and of varying width, generally a few hundred feet (~100 M) wide. While the Full Gospel Church building is within Montgomery County, the driveways are in Frederick County and portions of the parking lot are in Howard County.

Damascus is west of the fall line between the Piedmont of Appalachia and the Atlantic coastal plain. Damascus is known for its rural landscape and family-owned farms. According to the United States Census Bureau, the place has a total area of , all land. 34

The town is located on Parr&#x27;s Ridge, a low shale ridge that rises about 300 feet above the surrounding Piedmont. Open hilltops in the area afford pisquerias vistas of the Appalachian Mountains to the southwest, west, and northwest. These ridges include Sugarloaf Mountain and South Mountain, MD, Catoctin Mountain, in MD and PA, and the Blue Ridge of VA. On very clear days, two 4,000 foot plus peaks in the Shenandoah National Park of VA can be seen 75 miles to the southwest.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by warm, humid summers and generally cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Damascus has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

Due to its higher elevation, rural landscape, and northernmost location in Montgomery County, its 32-inch average snowfall is the highest in the county and the immediately adjacent Washington D.C. suburbs. In the record-breaking winter of 2009–2010, 98.4 inches of snow fell and a maximum depth of 37 inches was recorded, the greatest snow depth in the area&#x27;s history. Occasionally intense blizzards fed by coastal waters can paralyze the area. In average winters, snow-covered ground comes and goes. In severe winters, ponds may stay frozen and the ground will remain snow-covered for a month or two.

Rainfall is usually plentiful and well distributed throughout the year. In an average year, about 46 inches is recorded. Thunderstorms are quite common during June to August. Sometimes they produce hail and damaging winds, but tornadoes are rare.

Temperatures are moderate. January&#x27;s average monthly temperature is 31 °F, and July&#x27;s is 74 °F. Occasionally, frigid Arctic outbreaks from Canada can drive minimum temperatures below for a morning or two. During the summer months, heat waves can produce a week or two of 90 °F or higher afternoon days. Summer morning temperatures are usually pleasant, averaging in the mid-60s.

==Education and athletics==
Damascus High School (DHS) is well-known regionally and nationally for its championship athletic teams, known as the Swarmin&#x27; Hornets. DHS is one of the few remaining schools in the state to still hold its graduation ceremonies on the school&#x27;s football field. A rite of passage for many graduating seniors is to walk on the field and receive their diploma not only in front of family and friends in the stands, but also the several hundred townspeople who gather outside the fences to watch the ceremony. In the case of inclement weather, the graduation ceremony is held in the high school&#x27;s auditorium.

Former U.S. Secretary of State and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell was the speaker for Damascus High School&#x27;s Class of 2000 commencement ceremony at the high school&#x27;s football stadium. Billy Ripken, brother of Oriole baseball player Cal Ripken Jr., was the speaker for the 2013 commencement, which also took place at the Damascus High School football stadium.

==Civic groups==
The American Legion is active in the community. Since Damascus Post 171 was founded after World War II, it has engaged in charitable and civic endeavors, ranging from installing Christmas decorations downtown to sponsoring high school scholarships. Post 171 is host to annual ceremonies commemorating Memorial Day and Veterans Day on the grounds of the Post home. Post 171 also sponsors an American Junior Legion baseball team, which is a perennial champion.

Montgomery County Fire &amp; Rescue Company 13, with headquarters in Damascus, is one of the oldest companies in the Montgomery County fire service. Originating in 1940 as an all-Volunteer force, the Damascus Volunteer Fire Department-Company 13 transitioned to a mix of full-time professionals and volunteers since the late 1980s. Today, the company is responsible for a fast growing residential and downtown area.
