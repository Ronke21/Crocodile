<text>Emmylou Harris (born April 2, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, bandleader, and activist. She is considered one of the leading music artists behind the country rock genre in the 1970s and the Americana genre in the 1990s. Her music united both country and rock audiences in live performance settings. Her characteristic voice, musical style and songwriting have been acclaimed by critics and fellow recording artists.

Harris developed an interest in folk music in her early years, which led to her performing professionally. After moving to New York City in the 1960s, she recorded a folk album and performed regionally. She was discovered by Gram Parsons, who influenced her country rock direction. Following his 1973 death, Harris obtained her own recording contract from Reprise–Warner Bros. Her second album, &quot;Pieces of the Sky&quot; (1975), found both critical acclaim and commercial success. Follow-up 1970s albums further elevated Harris&#x27;s career, such as &quot;Elite Hotel&quot; (1976), &quot;Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town&quot; (1978) and &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot; (1979). By 1980, she had acquired four number-one songs on the US and Canadian country charts: &quot;Together Again&quot;, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, &quot;Two More Bottles of Wine&quot; and &quot;Beneath Still Waters&quot;.

Harris had a continued string of commercially and critically successful albums like &quot;Roses in the Snow&quot; (1980), &quot;Evangeline&quot; (1981) and &quot;Last Date&quot; (1982). Her backing group, the Hot Band helped establish a musical foundation for her concerts and albums. Her 1980s albums spawned the top ten singles &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;, &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Last Date&quot;. The 1985 album &quot;The Ballad of Sally Rose&quot; was among Harris&#x27;s first self-written projects. The album (along with its follow-ups) failed to sustain the commercial momentum of previous albums. Harris then collaborated with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt on &quot;Trio&quot; (1987). The platinum-selling album was also a critical success that spawned four top ten singles.

In 1992, Warner Bros. released the live album &quot;At the Ryman&quot;. It garnered critical praise and renewed interest in its live venue, the Ryman Auditorium. Harris was inspired to move in a new musical direction with 1995&#x27;s &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;. She then reunited with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt for &quot;Trio II&quot; (1999). By the 2000s, Harris had signed with Nonesuch Records and recorded several albums of self-composed material like &quot;Red Dirt Girl&quot; (2000), &quot;All I Intended to Be&quot; (2008) and &quot;Hard Bargain&quot; (2011). She also found collaborative partnerships, such as with Mark Knopfler on the internationally successful &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot; (2006). She then collaborated with Rodney Crowell on the critically acclaimed &quot;Old Yellow Moon&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Traveling Kind&quot; (2015). She also became involved in activism during this time, including starting her own dog rescue called Bonaparte&#x27;s Retreat.

Harris has been estimated to have sold over 15 million records worldwide. She has also earned 13 Grammy Awards, placed 27 singles into the top ten of the US country chart, and several of her albums have received gold certifications in the US. She was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008 and was ranked among &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2022.

==Early life==
Harris was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1947. She was one of two children born to Walter Rutland Harris and Eugenia Harris. Her older brother, Walter Harris Jr., enjoyed country music in his youth. Her father was a Marine Corps officer who served in both World War II and the Korean War. In the latter, he was taken as a Prisoner of War and was reported as missing in action. He was later released. &quot;I never talked to him about his experiences. He wouldn&#x27;t ever talk about it,&quot; she later reflected. The Harris family lived in Birmingham through their daughter&#x27;s first grade school year. Her father was then transferred to Cherry Point, North Carolina, and later to Quantico, Virginia.

Harris took piano lessons as a child but did not enjoy them. During her high school years, the family eventually settled in nearby Woodbridge, Virginia. Harris was a straight-A high school student at Gar-Field Senior High School, a cheerleader and a saxophonist in the marching band. She also won the &quot;Miss Woodbridge&quot; beauty pageant during her teen years. Classmates considered Harris unusual because she was devoted to her studies. Harris was among many adolescents interested in the American folk music revival of the 1960s. She became fascinated with folk artists of the era such as Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Buffy Sainte-Marie. Her grandfather gave Harris her first guitar, which she learned to play.

In 1965, Harris graduated from Gar-Field (which was desegregated shortly before she left) as the class valedictorian. Her original intention was to become an actress and she received a drama scholarship from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. She began taking classes in the fall of 1965. Harris participated in the school&#x27;s productions of &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;The Dancing Donkey&quot;. She also helped form a folk music duo with Mike Williams called the Emerald City. The duo worked a series of gigs in the local area, most of which were coffeehouses. She also played coffeehouses as a solo performer, primarily in one known as &quot;The Corner&quot;.

In 1967, Harris dropped out of the University of North Carolina. She then enrolled at Boston University but would soon drop out as well. She ultimately chose to pursue a career as a folk singer full-time. Harris briefly moved to Virginia Beach, where she worked as a waitress and as a folk singer. She then left for New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village neighborhood where there was a popular folk music scene. In 1969, Harris married her first husband Tom Slocum and soon gave birth to her first child.

==Career==
===1969–1974: Folk music and collaborations with Gram Parsons===
Harris regularly worked the Greenwich Village music scene and developed friendships with fellow artists Jerry Jeff Walker, Dave Bromberg and Paul Siebel. She worked at several notable Greenwich Village clubs, including The Bitter End. She also supported herself by working as a waitress and bookstore cashier. Along with her husband and daughter, Harris lived at a nearby YWCA. Harris got her first manager and signed with Jubilee Records in 1969. The label released her debut studio album, &quot;Gliding Bird&quot;, in 1970. The disc featured several recordings penned by Harris herself, along with one penned by her first husband, Tom Slocum. Unlike her later recordings, &quot;Gliding Bird&quot; was released under the name &quot;Emmy Lou Harris&quot;.

Jubilee Records declared bankruptcy shortly after &quot;Gliding Bird&quot; was released. Harris and her husband then decided to attempt a music career in Nashville, Tennessee. The couple divorced while in Nashville. Harris attempted to support herself and her daughter by working as a waitress. However, she was surviving on food stamps and Medicaid. Ultimately, she went back to live with her parents in the Maryland suburb of Clarksville, near Washington, D.C.. Harris then obtained a hostessing job in Columbia, Maryland.

At the same time, Harris developed a following performing at clubs in Washington, D.C. and its surrounding suburbs. Yet, she was unconvinced she could make it as a music artist. &quot;At that point, I&#x27;d retired forever from the music business,&quot; she recalled. Among the clubs Harris worked during this period was Clyde&#x27;s and The Cellar Door. In 1971, she performed the country song &quot;It Wasn&#x27;t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels&quot; one evening at The Cellar Door, &quot;almost as a joke&quot;, as she knew little about country music at that time. The Flying Burrito Brothers noticed her performing while they were drinking after a show and thought she had potential. Though singer-songwriter Gram Parsons had left the Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers at this time, he was establishing a solo career and mentioned to the Burritos and friends that he was looking for a harmony singer. A conversation about her at a DC nightclub was overheard by the babysitter of Harris&#x27;s daughter, who passed on her details, and Parsons got in contact the next day. Parsons went to hear Harris and was drawn to her singing ability. One year later, he sent her a plane ticket to Los Angeles, California where she recorded harmony vocals for his debut album &quot;GP&quot; in September-October, 1972. After its release, the album failed to become successful and find a mainstream audience.

Harris also toured as a member of Parsons&#x27;s band (the Grievous Angels) in 1973, and performed vocal harmonies and duets with him. Through recording and touring, the pair found an instant musical connection. Parsons had become known for his fusion of country rock and had a fascination with classic country music. His passion for the genre was influential on Harris and she soon learned about the country genre. Harris would later credit Parsons for helping her find her artistic direction as well as her passion for authentic country music. In 1973, Harris returned to the recording studio to make Parsons&#x27; next album, titled &quot;Grievous Angel&quot;. Weeks following the album&#x27;s sessions, Parsons died from a drug and alcohol overdose in a hotel room near Joshua Tree National Park. Parsons&#x27;s &quot;Grievous Angel&quot; was released posthumously in 1974, and three more tracks from his sessions with Harris were included on another posthumous Parsons album, &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot;, in 1976. One more album of recorded material from that period was packaged as &quot;Live 1973&quot; but was not released until 1982.

===1975–1980: Solo breakthrough===
Although affected by Gram Parsons&#x27; death, Harris continued on as a solo artist. She decided to carry on the country rock legacy left by Parsons for her own career. &quot;Once I started singing country music with Gram there was no turning back for me,&quot; she recounted. Harris formed her own band and got a weekly job performing at the Red Fox Inn in Bethesda, Maryland. Meanwhile, Parsons’ former A&amp;R representative at Warner Bros. Records (Mary Martin) attempted to launch Harris&#x27;s own career. She contacted Canadian-based producer Brian Ahern, who had recent success working alongside Anne Murray. Impressed by her, Ahern agreed to produce Harris. The pair would later marry in 1977 and Harris then signed with Warner Bros.–Reprise.
Ahern produced Harris&#x27;s next several albums beginning with 1975&#x27;s &quot;Pieces of the Sky&quot;. It featured covers of songs by The Beatles and Merle Haggard, along with originals like Harris&#x27; &quot;Boulder to Birmingham&quot;, which reflected her emotions surrounding Parsons&#x27;s death. The disc was a commercial success, reaching number seven on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; country LP&#x27;s chart and number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 all-genre chart. Its second single, &quot;If I Could Only Win Your Love&quot; reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country songs chart and topped the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; country chart. It was followed by 1975&#x27;s &quot;Elite Hotel&quot;. It was her first to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart while also climbing into &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top 25. The disc&#x27;s covers of Buck Owens&#x27;s &quot;Together Again&quot; and Don Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Harris formed a new backing group for the project called The Hot Band. The group featured James Burton, Glen D. Hardin (both members of Elvis Presley&#x27;s TCB Band) and Rodney Crowell.

Harris&#x27; albums received critical and commercial success. Adam Sweeting of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found &quot;Pieces of the Sky&quot; to have &quot;many brilliant songs&quot;. Grant Alden of &quot;No Depression&quot; concluded that when both LPs are played &#x27;front to back&#x27; it makes for &quot;an astonishing, almost blemish-free collection&quot;. &quot;Elite Hotel&quot; also brought Harris the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Additionally, both LPs were certified gold in the United States for selling over half a million copies each.

In 1975, Harris contributed backing vocals to several tracks on Bob Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;Desire&quot;.

Harris&#x27;s next several studio collections included both traditional country cover tunes and new material. In 1976, Warner Bros. issued her fourth album, &quot;Luxury Liner&quot;, which was her second number-one US country album. It also was her second to make the top 20 in the United Kingdom and third to certify gold in the US. Jason Ankeny named it &quot;one of her most engaging efforts&quot;. Warner Bros. followed it with 1978&#x27;s &quot;Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town&quot;, which was considered to have &quot;over-careful production&quot;, according to Grant Alden. It made the top five of the US country chart, the top 25 of the US all-genre chart, the top ten of the Canadian country chart and later certified gold in sales. The albums spawned the number one US and Canadian country singles &quot;Making Believe&quot;, &quot;To Daddy&quot; and &quot;Two More Bottles of Wine&quot;. They also spawned a top ten cover of &quot;You Never Can Tell (C&#x27;est La Vie)&quot; and the US top 20 original tune &quot;Easy From Now On&quot;.

Harris&#x27; record label proposed shifting her career towards country pop crossover stardom. Instead, Harris recorded two traditionally-oriented albums, beginning with 1979&#x27;s &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot;. It was a top-ten disc on the North American country charts and received a gold certification. It also won a Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. The follow-up was 1980&#x27;s &quot;Roses in the Snow&quot;, which was considered to embed bluegrass sounds. Like its predecessor, &quot;Roses in the Snow&quot; went gold and reached the number two on the country charts in the US and Canada. Harris&#x27; new bluegrass sound was credited to the new Hot Band member Ricky Skaggs, who replaced Rodney Crowell. Both albums spawned top ten US and Canadian country singles: &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;, &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot;, &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Beneath Still Waters&quot; went to the number one spot in both countries. &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot; among its April 1979 &quot;Top Album Picks&quot;, calling Harris&#x27; voice &quot;crystal clear&quot;, while &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine highlighted Harris&#x27;s &quot;beautiful, sensitive voice&quot; on &quot;Roses in the Snow&quot;.

Harris gave birth to a second daughter during this period and briefly stopped touring. Shortly beforehand, the Christmas-themed &quot;Light of the Stable&quot; (1979) was released and was followed by &quot;Evangeline&quot; (1981). The latter was a studio collection compiled from songs that were &quot;left off&quot; previous albums. &quot;Evangeline&quot; certified gold in sales and reached number five on the US country chart. It spawned a cover of &quot;Mister Sandman&quot;, which topped the Canadian country chart, reached the US country top ten and made the US pop top 40. Although the song&#x27;s album version featured harmony vocals from Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt, Harris harmonized with herself for the single version. Harris also collaborated with Roy Orbison during this time for the 1980 single &quot;That Lovin&#x27; You Feeling Again&quot;. It would later win the Grammy for Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. Harris also won the Female Vocalist of the Year award from the Country Music Association.

===1981–1990: Commercial decline, comeback with &quot;Trio&quot; and further Warner Bros. releases===
Around 1981, Ricky Skaggs left the Hot Band and was replaced by Barry Tashian. Drummer John Ware also left Harris&#x27; backing group, which prompted her to reform the Hot Band with new members. Her next studio album, &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1981) was cut with the new Hot Band. It made the US country albums top ten and the US all-genre top 50. It spawned the US and Canadian top ten country songs &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Tennessee Rose&quot;. A duet with Don Williams called &quot;If I Needed You&quot; topped the Canadian country chart. In 1982, Harris and the Hot Band recorded her first live album, titled &quot;Last Date&quot;. Its lead single was a vocal version of Floyd Cramer&#x27;s instrumental original song &quot;Last Date&quot;. The single topped the US country chart and was followed by the top-five single &quot;I&#x27;m Movin&#x27; On&quot;. Both albums received mixed reviews, with Grant Alden of &quot;No Depression&quot; finding that &quot;Cimarron&quot; and &quot;Last Date&quot; are no &quot;monumental artistic statement&quot; but occasionally &quot;have their moments&quot;. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic gave &quot;Last Date&quot; 2.5 stars, explaining that Harris failed to create original styles and arrangements that previously set her apart.

Harris&#x27; final album under Brian Ahern&#x27;s production (the pair would then divorce) was released in 1983, called &quot;White Shoes&quot;. The disc featured a collection of cover songs. Among its tracks were the singles &quot;Pledging My Love&quot; and &quot;In My Dreams&quot;, both of which reached the US and Canadian country top ten. &quot;White Shoes&quot; was among her lowest-peaking albums to date on the US country chart, stalling at number 22. Harris then relocated to Nashville, where she collaborated with new producer Paul Kennerly (whom she later married). The pair composed &quot;The Ballad of Sally Rose&quot;, which was released by Warner Bros. in 1985. Featuring compositions written by Harris herself, &quot;The Ballad of Sally Rose&quot;. The record was loosely based on her time with Gram Parsons. Despite reaching the US country top ten the album ultimately resulted in poor record sales and was considered a commercial failure. Yet its embedding of various musical styles was praised by critics.
In 1986, Warner Bros. released her next studio album, &quot;Thirteen&quot;. The disc was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a &quot;roots record&quot; with comparisons drawn to 1980&#x27;s &quot;Roses in the Snow&quot;. However, the album proved to be less successful. Both of its singles reached positions outside the top 40 on the North American country charts. Although recorded prior to &quot;Thirteen&quot;, &quot;Angel Band&quot; followed on Warner Bros. in 1987 and was an album of gospel material. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as a &quot;solid but [low-key]&quot; gospel project&quot;. It was Harris&#x27; third album to only reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; country top 25.

In 1987, Harris collaborated with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt to record the studio album, &quot;Trio&quot;. The women had been friends for over a decade and had intentions to record an album together for years. Several tracks that had originally been laid down were scrapped and replaced by a new studio collection of country–folk songs. &quot;Trio&quot; featured Harris, Parton and Ronstadt singing together in harmony and often featured one of the women singing lead vocals. &quot;Trio&quot; became a commercial success and is the best-selling disc of Harris&#x27; career. Following its March 1987 release, &quot;Trio&quot; reached number one on the US country chart, number six on the US all-genre list, number 12 in Australia and number four in Canada. Spawned from the disc were the North American top ten country songs &quot;To Know Him Is to Love Him&quot;, &quot;Telling Me Lies&quot;, &quot;Those Memories of You&quot; and &quot;Wildflowers&quot;.

In 1989, Warner Bros. released the solo album &quot;Bluebird&quot;. It included material penned by songwriters Kate McGarrigle and Anna McGarrigle, and two songs penned by Harris herself. Considered a country rock effort by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; the album peaked in the top 20 of both the US and Canadian country charts. Its lead single, &quot;Heartbreak Hill&quot;, returned Harris to the top ten as a solo artist and was followed by the top 20 single, &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot;. Her final studio album with Warner Bros. was released in 1990, titled &quot;Brand New Dance&quot;. It was categorized as an &quot;uninspired misfire&quot; by Rolling Stone while AllMusic drew similar comparisons to Harris seeming disengaged with the material.

===1991–1999: New artistic directions and further collaborations===
Around 1991, Harris dissolved the Hot Band and formed a new backing group called the Nash Ramblers. The group included Sam Bush playing fiddle, Al Perkins playing banjo and guitar, and Jon Randall performing various instruments. Harris then intended to record a live album of material she had never performed before. Music executive Bonnie Garner suggested recording the set at the Ryman Auditorium (the former site of the Grand Ole Opry, which was becoming increasingly dilapidated). In spring 1991, Harris and the Nash Ramblers recorded the live project over three nights with only 200 guests in attendance. The live disc was released in 1992 and was titled &quot;At the Ryman&quot; and was met with critical acclaim. Writers have since speculated the project brought renewed interest to the Ryman Auditorium and several months following the album, the venue was refurbished.

Harris was also president of the Country Music Foundation in the early 1990s and became an official member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1992. Harris also departed from Warner–Reprise during this period and signed a new contract with Asylum Records. In 1993, the label released the studio project &quot;Cowgirl&#x27;s Prayer&quot;. It was Harris&#x27; last project produced by Paul Kennerley and the pair divorced shortly afterward. The album made the top 40 of the US country albums chart and the top 20 of the Canadian country albums chart. Despite critical acclaim its singles received limited radio airplay. Two of its singles made the US and Canada country charts, but failed to make positions inside the top 40.

By the middle 1990s, Harris was feeling excluded by country music radio. Asylum Records gave her the musical freedom to record her next album. In 1995, Asylum issued the studio album &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;. The disc was produced by Daniel Lanois (known for producing U2 and Peter Gabriel), who embedded an alternative rock style into its sound and style. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, its production has been considered influential in establishing the Americana music genre. Although ignored by country radio, &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; reached number 94 on the US albums chart, number 58 in Canada number 46 in the UK and received the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic called it &quot;a hypnotic, staggeringly beautiful work&quot;, while Allison Hussey of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it &quot;a staggering work that defied expectations for what a middle-aged woman should be doing with her time.&quot;

In 1998, Harris&#x27;s third live album, &quot;Spyboy&quot;, was released. It featured live cuts of songs that Harris had recorded throughout her career. It was recorded with Harris&#x27;s new backing band, which were also called Spyboy. Also in 1998, Harris appeared on Willie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Teatro&quot; album, featuring production from Harris then-producer Lanois.

In 1999, Asylum issued the second collaborative album by Harris, Parton and Ronstadt titled &quot;Trio II&quot;. Although the project was completed in 1994, it took five years to be released. &quot;Trio II&quot; rose to the number four position on the North American country album charts certified gold in the United States. &quot;Time&quot; called the disc &quot;an angelic encounter&quot;, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found it was &quot;not worth the wait&quot; due to the disc&#x27;s &quot;sense of familiarity&quot;. Its single &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; brought the three artists the Best Country Collaboration with Vocals accolade from the Grammys. Meanwhile, Harris and Ronstadt had been wanting to make their own collaborative album together. After years of discussion and planning, the pair released &quot;Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions&quot;. The album was also released on Asylum in 1999. Within a month, the collaborative project reached number six on the US country chart and number 73 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===2000–2011: From song interpreter to singer-songwriter===
Harris parted ways with her record label and management during this period. In 2000, she signed with Nonesuch Records and that year the label released her first solo studio album in five years, called &quot;Red Dirt Girl&quot;. It was Harris&#x27; first disc since &quot;The Ballad of Sally Rose&quot; that featured mostly self-written recordings. It also featured Bruce Springsteen and Patty Griffin singing background vocals. &quot;Time&quot; called it &quot;a surprisingly raw and confessional collection&quot; while &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;superb&quot;. &quot;Red Dirt Girl&quot; rose to number five on the US country albums chart, number 54 on the US all-genre chart, number three on the Canadian country albums chart and number 29 on the Canadian all-genre chart. Its single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Talk About It Now&quot; was Harris&#x27; first to make the US Adult Alternative Airplay chart. &quot;Red Dirt Girl&quot; won Harris another Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk album. Harris also contributed to the soundtrack of &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, which won a Grammy for Album of the Year.
In 2003, Harris followed up with her next studio release &quot;Stumble into Grace&quot;. Like its predecessor, the album contained self-penned songs. It also featured harmony vocals from Linda Ronstadt. Allmusic&#x27;s Mark Deming commented that &quot;&quot;Stumble into Grace&quot; shows she&#x27;s still playing at the top of her game&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;a very affecting record&quot;. The album reached the US country top ten and made the top 20 in both Norway and Sweden. During this period, Harris also toured frequently alongside Elvis Costello and recorded the song &quot;The Scarlet Tide&quot; (the original version of the song was featured in the soundtrack of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;). In 2005, Harris recorded the song &quot;A Love That Will Never Grow Old&quot;, which appeared in the LGBT film &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;.

Harris and Mark Knopfler (formerly of the band Dire Straits) spent seven years writing and recording songs, which would make up their collaborative studio effort, &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot;. Some of the songs on the collection were originally for a different Knofler project but were instead used for &quot;All the Roadrunning&quot;. In 2006, it became a top 20 disc on the US album chart but reached the top ten in the UK and Sweden. In Norway, the album topped the all-genre chart. Spawned from the disc was the single &quot;This Is Us&quot;, which reached number five on the US Adult Alternative Airplay chart and number 17 in Norway. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the album &quot;a smart marriage of strengths and weaknesses&quot; and AllMusic found it to be a &quot;lush and earthy collaboration&quot;.

In 2008, a solo album titled &quot;All I Intended to Be&quot; was released. It featured Brian Ahern producing the project. Contributors included Vince Gill and Dolly Parton. Harris then toured in support of the album with an ensemble she dubbed the Red Dirt Boys. It reached the top five of the US country albums chart, the top 25 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the top ten on the Swedish all-genre chart. In 2010, Harris re-recorded her song &quot;Boulder to Birmingham&quot; with the rock group the Fray and was issued as a single by Epic Records that year.

In 2011, Nonesuch Records released Harris&#x27; fourth self-composed album &quot;Hard Bargain&quot;. The project was produced by Nashville&#x27;s Jay Joyce. Similar to her previous albums, its songs reflected themes about southern culture. Among its tracks was a song about the life of Emmett Till, a teenage boy murdered in the American south during the 1950s. &quot;Hard Bargain&quot; reached the US country albums top five, the US all-genre top 20, the Canadian top 20, the UK top 30 and the Norwegian top 15. Ken Tucker of NPR called &quot;Hard Bargain&quot; both &quot;invigorating&quot; and &quot;inviting&quot;. Steven Rosen of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; found Harris&#x27; songwriting on the album to occasionally &quot;stumble&quot; but also do well in &quot;addressing personal sadness&quot;.

===2012–present: Rodney Crowell collaborations and recent endeavors===

Harris agreed to contribute to the soundtrack of Nick Cave&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Lawless&quot;. She recorded three songs that appeared on the soundtrack. The &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; described Harris&#x27; vocal performance on &quot;Lawless&quot; as &quot;serene&quot;. Harris released an album of duets with Rodney Crowell in 2013 called &quot;Old Yellow Moon&quot;. Although a duet album was discussed for years, the timing never worked out due to their different schedules. The pair re-recorded songs that had previously appeared on their individual albums. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; found &quot;Old Yellow Moon&quot; to balance &quot;retro-country and retro-rock with a sure and satisfying sense of balance&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot; named the project one of its &quot;Albums of the Week&quot; in February 2013. &quot;Old Yellow Moon&quot; reached number four on the US country chart, number 29 on the US all-genre chart, number six in Norway and number 42 in the UK. It later won a Grammy award. It was followed in 2015 by the pair&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Traveling Kind&quot; and was a tribute to songwriters like Kris Kristofferson and Roger Miller. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded it three stars out of five and four out of five stars from &quot;American Songwriter&quot;. &quot;The Traveling Kind&quot; reached the top ten of the US country chart.

In 2014, Harris announced a book deal with Blue Rider, a Penguin Books publishing imprint. In 2017, she told &quot;The Capital Times&quot; that the piece would be a memoir of her life. In 2021, Harris told &quot;Clash&quot; magazine that she was still writing her memoir. In 2021, Nonesuch Records released the live disc &quot;Ramble in Music City: The Lost Concert&quot;, which was recorded with The Nash Ramblers in 1990 but was first shelved. In 2021, Harris told &quot;Clash&quot; magazine that she was no longer writing songs because she didn&#x27;t &quot;feel the need&quot; and have the sense of &quot;urgency&quot;. However, she continues to perform and play shows.

==Artistry==
===Influences===

Harris found her first appreciation for music through the folk genre during the American folk revival. During her adolescence, she listened to American University&#x27;s WAMU radio station, which played folk music nightly. Harris taught herself to play the guitar, sing and follow along with the radio. Harris&#x27; early folk influences included Ian &amp; Sylvia, Peter, Paul and Mary, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Judy Collins, and Bob Dylan. Harris was also influenced by Pete Seeger. At age 16, she wrote him a letter wondering if her life was too privileged to be singing about the story lines in folk songs. Another significant influence was Joan Baez, whom she recalled having a &quot;spiritual&quot; connection to. &quot;I worshiped her. Still do in a way, because she just changed my whole focus on music,&quot; she told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Harris received further exposure to country music and developed an appreciation for it through her collaborations with Gram Parsons. She told &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; that she had not taken the genre seriously up to that point because she did not see the artistry of it. Parsons exposed Harris to the music of the Louvin Brothers, Bill Monroe and George Jones. Their songs became a significant influence on her. &quot;These were deep, emotionally troubling songs, but he opened my ears to the beauty of it, the simplicity of the poetry,&quot; she explained. Harris hired Rodney Crowell to join her band when she became a solo act. His traditional Texan country background was said by Harris to influence her country music artistry. &quot;I think that his presence in the early part of my career, first as a songwriter and then as a member of the band and then as kind of my soul brother, musically, was really important to getting my footing as a performing artist,&quot; Harris commented.

===Musical styles, musicianship and collaborations===
Writers, editors and historians have largely identified Harris with the country rock musical style. Harris took the sound of California folk rock and embedded it with traditional country. Author Frank Hoffman wrote, &quot;Emmylou Harris has maintained a successful recording career over four decades by maintaining a steadfast allegiance to roots styles in the face of rampant technological change and media image manipulation.&quot; David DiMartio found that her 1970s albums merged rock with classic country in a way that helped Harris receive fans young and old. Buzz McClain of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that Harris&#x27; albums helped &quot;define&quot; the country rock music style. Authors Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann concluded that Harris was the &quot;beacon&quot; of the country rock movement during the 1970s and 1980s.
As Harris&#x27; career progressed, she took more inspiration from the alternative music community. Critics have pointed to 1995&#x27;s &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; as a turning point in her musical style. The album&#x27;s production was said to embed new aspects of rock that had not been in her music previously. From then on, critics credited Harris with helping to define the alternative country sub genre. Writers have also categorized her music as progressive country and outlaw country. Her association with other genres authors to consider her a forerunner for the Americana style, a genre centered on roots music. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has since given the moniker of the &quot;Godmother of Americana&quot;.

Harris&#x27;s musicianship has also been discussed and spoken about. She often sought out other musicians to enhance and develop her musical style. This started with Harris&#x27; first backing group the Hot Band, which was formed when her first record label needed studio musicians for her recordings. &quot;We gotta put the chick singer together with a hot band,&quot; Harris recalled someone at her record company saying. From then on, Harris collaborated with her backing musicians to help enhance her style and performances onstage. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum explained how her backing bands influenced the way her musical style shifted as years went by. Harris herself explained that her style of country music embedded more rock influences compared to previous interpretations of the genre.

Harris&#x27; artistry has also been remembered for her collaborations with various artists. She has made appearances on songs recorded by Ryan Adams, Neil Young, Johnny Cash, Sheryl Crow, and numerous others. &quot;It&#x27;s likely that on her school report it was said of the young Emmylou Harris that &#x27;she plays well with others&#x27;,&quot; wrote Bernard Zuel of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. Noah Berlatsky of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that Harris&#x27; own career &quot;was never precisely solo&quot; because of her emphasis on collaborating with other artists. &quot;Her enthusiasm for finding new artists to work with has been a huge boon for her music,&quot; he commented. Harris herself stated, &quot;I think it&#x27;s just a willingness to be a part of the landscape, in a way. I&#x27;ve been very lucky in that all (my) collaborations have been real musical and very satisfying and inspiring.&quot;

===Vocals===
Writers have characterized Harris&#x27;s singing voice as that of a soprano, and she is described as being both &quot;delicate&quot; and &quot;crystalline&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Emmylou Harris&#x27;s voice is an alloy of crystal and steel, and this mixture of delicacy and resilience lends her the aura of an idealized frontier woman.&quot; Jason Ankeny of AllMusic wrote, &quot;Blessed with a crystalline voice, a remarkable gift for phrasing, and a restless creative spirit, few artists had as profound an impact on contemporary music as Emmylou Harris.&quot; Harris herself explained that her voice sounds unique because it is rooted in folk styles: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a style or a voice of my own. And in singing country, I was singing in a folk voice. I didn&#x27;t have what you would consider a true country voice like Loretta Lynn, Kitty [Wells] or Tammy [Wynette], or some of the younger singers; Tanya Tucker – great voice. But my voice was always more on the side of folk.&quot;

==Legacy, influence and awards==
Emmylou Harris has striven to follow a consistent music direction in her career that has helped influence modern contemporary music. Through her fusion of the country and rock genres, Harris helped to unite rural country audiences and metropolitan rock audiences together in one setting. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic wrote, &quot;She traveled a singular artistic path, proudly carrying the torch of &quot;cosmic American music&quot; passed down by her mentor, Gram Parsons, which made a profound mark on both country and rock.&quot; Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann wrote, &quot;She showed Nashville that country music could succeed uncompromised, with dignity intact. She made country music hip.&quot; Harris is also credited with influencing the neotraditional country sub-genre that was established in the 1980s and 1990s. &quot;The Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World&quot; wrote, &quot;Harris would carry the torch into the following decades as a revered country music traditionalist who respected and drew inspiration from the west coast pioneers.&quot;
Writer David DiCaire called Harris one of American music&#x27;s most well-remembered voices. Marissa R. Moss of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called her &quot;one of music&#x27;s most revered voices&quot; and &quot;one of America&#x27;s finest interpreters of song&quot;. Chuck Dauphin of &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote, &quot;Nobody can deliver a song aching with sadness and loneliness quite like Emmylou Harris. When she pours her heart and soul into a lyric, you are instantly grabbed emotionally in a way that few artists can.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Harris at number 79 on its list of the &quot;200 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;, further commenting that she is &quot;arguably the greatest American harmony vocalist of the past half-century&quot;.

Bufwack and Oermann explained how Harris&#x27;s music changed the direction of country music decades later. In the years following her rise to success, Harris was considered a major influence on several country artists during the 1980s and 1990s. Miranda Lambert credited Harris as an artist determined to make her own choices and choose her own direction. Reflecting on her artistic decisions, Trisha Yearwood commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve had to say to myself, well, if I passed Emmylou Harris on the street, would I be able to hold my head up?&quot; Harris has also been a credited influence on Ryan Adams, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, Patty Loveless, Martina McBride, Reba McEntire, Kacey Musgraves, Margo Price, LeAnn Rimes, Pam Tillis, Carrie Underwood and Wilco.

In 1999, Harris received the &quot;Billboard&quot; Century Award, which is given to &quot;the uncommon excellence of one artist&#x27;s still-unfolding body of work.&quot; In 2003, she was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. Along with the Statler Brothers and Tom T. Hall, Harris was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008. In 2009, Linda Ronstadt and Earl Scruggs were present when Harris received an honorary doctorate from the Berklee College of Music. At the 2012 Academy of Country Music &quot;Honors&quot; ceremony, Harris was presented with the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award. In 2015, Harris and Evelyn Glennie received Sweden&#x27;s Polar Music Prize. Along with Tina Turner, she was then presented the 2018 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit released the song &quot;Emmylou&quot; in 2012 as a tribute to Harris. They performed the song when she received the Polar Music Prize in 2015. In 2016, Harris was honored with a tribute concert entitled &quot;The Life &amp; Songs of Emmylou Harris&quot;, which was later released as both a DVD and a live CD. The concert featured several of Harris&#x27;s closest friends and collaborators, including Rodney Crowell, Alison Krauss, and Lucinda Williams. Harris also performed at the concert which included her singing &quot;Boulder to Birmingham&quot; with other artists that were part of the program.

==Activism and dog rescue==
In 1997 and 1998, Harris performed in Sarah McLachlan&#x27;s Lilith Fair concert series, which promoted female music artists. Since 1999, Harris has organized an annual benefit tour called Concerts for a Landmine-Free World. All proceeds from the tours support the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation&#x27;s (VVAF) efforts to assist innocent victims of conflicts around the world. The tour also benefits the VVAF&#x27;s work to raise US awareness of the global land mine problem. Artists that have joined Harris on the road for these dates include Joan Baez, Mary Chapin Carpenter and Willie Nelson. She became a member of the newly formed Commission in the Humanities and Social Sciences of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011, which started as a way to promote research with the humanities and social sciences.

Since childhood, Harris has enjoyed caring for dogs and fantasized about establishing a dog rescue. In 2004, Harris&#x27; pet dog named Bonaparte died. To remember him, Harris decided to establish Bonaparte&#x27;s Retreat, a dog rescue whose purpose was to save stray dogs from animal shelters and house them until they found their &quot;forever home&quot;. The rescue resides in the Nashville area and often rescues dogs that are taken from the Metro Nashville Animal Care and Control facility. It also supports elderly or sickly dogs that are in need of a home. Harris helps raise funds for the program by creating concerts that sponsor the rescue. Bonaparte&#x27;s Retreat also works with a program that pairs troubled youth with foster animals. &quot;I think this is something that will affect their lives in a good way on into their adult lives,&quot; she commented.

==Personal life==
Harris has been married and divorced three times and has called herself a &quot;really good ex-wife&quot;. In 1969, Harris met fellow folk artist Tom Slocum while living in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village. They married the same year. In 1970, she gave birth to her first daughter, Hallie. In 1971, the couple divorced. In the early years of her career, Harris often took her daughter on the road with her. However, Hallie spent most of her time living with her grandparents in Maryland. &quot;I don&#x27;t think the road is good for kids. Once in a while it&#x27;s fun, like a trip to Disneyland. But not as a way of life,&quot; she commented. In 1977, Harris married her then-producer, Brian Ahern. The couple married at Ahern&#x27;s home in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The couple then lived in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Harris then welcomed her second child, Meghann, in 1979. In 1984, the couple divorced and Harris relocated to Nashville, Tennessee. In 1985, Harris married songwriter and record producer Paul Kennerley. For several years, Harris and her family lived in an older home located near the Music Row neighborhood in Nashville. In 1993, Kennerley and Harris divorced.

Harris has a granddaughter who was born in 2009 and a grandson born in 2012. She is a vegetarian. Her father died in 1993 after having an aortic rupture. Harris&#x27;s mother then lived with her for 21 years until her death in 2014. &quot;She&#x27;s just about my best friend. She has an extraordinary gift of making a home a home without being intrusive&quot;, Harris told CBS News in 2002.

<text>Deer Lodge is a city in and the county seat of Powell County, Montana, United States. The population was 2,938 at the 2020 census.

==Description==

The city is perhaps best known as the home of the Montana State Prison, a major local employer. The Montana State Hospital in Warm Springs and the former state tuberculosis sanitarium in nearby Galen are the result of the power the western part of the state held over Montana at statehood due to the copper and mineral wealth in that area. Deer Lodge was also once an important railroad town, serving as a division headquarters for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (&quot;the Milwaukee Road&quot;) before the railroad&#x27;s local abandonment in 1980.

The current Montana State Prison occupies a campus west of town. The former prison site, at the south end of Deer Lodge&#x27;s Main Street, is now the Old Prison Museum. In addition to a former cellblock building, the museum complex includes a theater, antique and automobile museums, and a former Milwaukee Road &quot;Little Joe&quot; electric locomotive.

Deer Lodge is also the location of Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, dedicated to the interpretation of the frontier cattle ranching era. This site was the home of Conrad Kohrs, one of the famous &quot;Cattle Kings&quot; of Montana whose land holdings once stretched over a million acres (4,000 km2) of Montana, Wyoming, and Alberta, Canada. The Grant-Kohrs ranch was built in 1862 by Johnny Grant, a Scottish/French/Metis fur-trader and trapper who encouraged his people to settle in Deer Lodge because of its pleasant climate and large areas of bunch grass prairie, ideal for raising cattle and horses. The city&#x27;s name derives from a geological formation known as Warm Springs Mound which contained natural saline that made for a natural salt lick for the local deer population, the protected valley in which Deer Lodge is located was where most of the local wildlife would winter as the temperatures lowered in the high country.

Deer Lodge was the site of the College of Montana, the first institution of higher learning in the state.

==History==
Extant mentions of the Deer Lodge Valley prior to 1860 are found as occasional remarks in records written for other purposes. Consistent record-keeping begins with the writings of Granville Stuart and others in the early 1860s. 1860 marks the beginning of permanent occupation of both the valley and the future site of the city of Deer Lodge by European-Americans.

===Fur trade era===
Before 1860, the Deer Lodge Valley was not the territory of any American Indian group. Gatherings were held there, including horse races. American Indian groups from the west, Flatheads, Pend d&#x27;Oreilles et al. passed through the valley as an alternative route to and from the buffalo hunting grounds to the east.

The first documented visit to this area by European-American explorers occurred in 1805–1806, when Lewis and Clark&#x27;s Corps of Discovery expedition passed by the Deer Lodge Valley without entering it. Evidence of earlier incursion, probably by Spaniards, was noted by miner James B. Beattle on Sugar Loaf mountain in the Race Track mining district on the west side of the Deer Lodge Valley.

Early European trapper/traders passing through the valley referred to it as &quot;the Deer House Plains&quot;. The Clark Fork river was called the Arrow Stone River in the 1830s. By the 1850s it was called the Deer Lodge Creek/Hellgate River. Catholic Father Pierre-Jean De Smet brought the first wagons known to have passed through the valley, in 1841.

In 1846, the Deer Lodge Valley became part of the United States and Oregon Territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty by the U. S. and Great Britain. From 1853 to 1863 it was in Washington Territory, then briefly part of Idaho Territory until the creation of Montana Territory in 1864.

European-American settlement of the valley gained momentum during the 1850s and 60&#x27;s, with the primary site being at present-day Deer Lodge. During the 1850s, trapper/traders from Fort Hall began wintering herds of horses and cattle in the valley. Also during that decade placer gold finds were made near present-day Gold Creek, first in 1852 by Francois (Bennetsee) Findley, followed in 1856 by Hereford, Saunders, Madison et al., and in 1858–61 by James and Granville Stuart, Reese Anderson et al. In 1860–62, Lt. John Mullan oversaw construction of the Mullan Road, which connected Walla Walla, Washington Territory with Fort Benton, then in Dakota Territory. The Mullan Road passed through the north end of the Deer Lodge Valley.

===European-American settlement, Montana gold rush===

John Francis (Johnny) Grant built the first permanent structures in the valley in 1859–60, at Grantsville near present-day Garrison. Grant had begun grazing cattle and horse herds in the north valley several years previously and &quot;wintered over&quot; there in 1857–58. In 1860, feeling as he said &quot;lonely&quot;, he returned to Fort Hall for summer trading and induced several fellow trader/trappers and their families to return to the valley with him at the end of the season. Instead of locating at Grantsville, his friends chose to build at the site of present-day Deer Lodge, where several Mexican trapper/traders and their Metis families had already established the seasonal settlement of Spanish Fork. While Johnny Grant had been at Fort Hall, several people had come from Fort Union down the Mullan Road route and begun building homes at Grantsville.

In 1861, the Stuart brothers and Reese Anderson established American Fork near present-day Gold Creek. Also in that year Johnny Grant moved his large family to his newly built house at Deer Lodge, at the present-day site of Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site. During the next two years, placer gold discoveries at Grasshopper Creek, Alder Gulch and other locations to the south caused a population decline in the valley, including the abandonment of Grantsville and American Fork. Beginning in 1864 with gold strikes to the north, Deer Lodge City grew rapidly as a base for supplies to mines in the surrounding mountains.

===Montana Territory===
By 1861–1862, Spanish Fork was more often referred to as Cottonwood. In 1862, a Deer Lodge Town Committee was established to lay out the town site, to be called LaBarge City - after Missouri River steamboat Captain Joseph LaBarge whose firm, LaBarge, Harkness &amp; Company, had proposed to start a business in Cottonwood. Creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 induced a name change to Idaho City. With the 1864 designation of Montana Territory, Deer Lodge City became the choice. Montana&#x27;s first territorial legislature defined most of the boundaries of Deer Lodge County, establishing the county seat at the placer mining camp of Silver Bow City, near Butte. In September 1865, county voters transferred the seat to Deer Lodge City.

During the first half of the 1860s, Granville Stuart described valley social life as including many gay dances and parties, which was the way of the Metis. By 1866, Johnny Grant and many of his fellow Metis had become disenchanted with their increasingly numerous neighbors from &quot;the States&quot;. In that year, Grant sold most of his Deer Lodge Valley holdings to Conrad Kohrs and in 1867 led a mass exodus of Metis families to the Red River country of Manitoba, Canada.

In 1869, the Territorial Prison was located at Deer Lodge. Also that year, the town site plat for Deer Lodge City was recorded. In 1878, Montana Collegiate Institute was established at Deer Lodge City. It opened for classes in 1883 and closed in 1914.

Attorney Horace Clagett, of the Deer Lodge firm Clagett and Dixon, was elected U.S. Representative from Montana Territory for the 1871–73 term. He was defeated for reelection by Martin Maginnis. Clagett was noted for introducing the legislation establishing Yellowstone National Park. Clagett&#x27;s partner, William W. Dixon, later moved to Butte and upset Thomas H. Carter in 1891 to serve a single term as U.S. Representative from the State of Montana.

Clagett and Dixon platted the first addition to Deer Lodge City in 1872. Perhaps its most prominent building was the former St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital.

===State of Montana, Powell County===
Deer Lodge City was incorporated in 1888, with a mayor and aldermen as officers. Montana achieved statehood in 1889 and a battle ensued between Helena and Anaconda over the location of the capitol in which Helena finally triumphed in 1894. In 1896, Anaconda took the Deer Lodge County seat away from Deer Lodge. This began a battle which culminated in the creation of Powell County in 1901, with its county seat at Deer Lodge.

===Frank Conley===

After statehood, the State of Montana let a contract to run Montana State Prison, which was awarded to Frank Conley and Thomas McTague. They held the contract until 1908. In that year, the State took over running Montana State Prison, appointing Frank Conley as warden. Conley remained in that capacity until 1921, when Governor Joseph M. Dixon replaced Conley with M. W. Potter. The Governor then commissioned an investigation of Conley&#x27;s administration. This resulted in the MacDonald Report, which would be used as the basis for a civil lawsuit by the State of Montana against Conley. The year following, Montana Attorney General Wellington Rankin sued Conley for misuse of state funds and materials, in the case &quot;State of Montana vs Frank Conley&quot;. The case took three months to try and resulted in the State of Montana being ordered to reimburse Conley. Deer Lodge City celebrated with a victory party.

Frank Conley was elected the fifth (1892–93), seventh (1895–1903) and tenth (1907–1928) mayor of Deer Lodge City. When he resigned for the last time, an article in the &quot;Billings Gazette&quot; called him &#x27;the longest serving mayor in American history&#x27;. Mayor Conley was instrumental in bringing the division headquarters and shops of the Milwaukee Road to Deer Lodge City in 1910. Over the next decade, he presided over the town&#x27;s infrastructure to accommodate the rapidly expanding population. He was also responsible for the building of the City Hall.

===Montana State Prison===
In 1908, inmates W. A. Hayes and George Rock killed guard John Robinson and seriously wounded Warden Conley in an attempted prison breakout. In 1959, a prolonged riot occurred at the prison, led by Jerry Miles and Lee Smart, which resulted in the slaying of Deputy Warden Ted Rothe and the eventual suicides of Miles and Smart. All inmates were moved in 1977–79 to a new state prison facility outside of Deer Lodge. The town of Deer Lodge employs the Powell County Museum &amp; Arts Foundation to manage the old facility as a museum.

===Superfund site===
In the 1870s, Butte developed into a rich silver mining camp. Marcus Daly&#x27;s discovery of rich copper veins in his Anaconda mine launched the Copper Kings era at Butte. In 1883, Daly established his smelter facilities at newly platted Anaconda, Montana. Anaconda immediately became Deer Lodge County&#x27;s major population center and employer. Smelting activities at Butte and Anaconda left behind enormous amounts of toxic wastes. Flooding on Silver Bow Creek and Warm Springs Creek, particularly in the great valley flood of 1908, spread toxic wastes from Butte through Deer Lodge City, to the Milltown Dam, just east of Missoula. As a result of legal actions begun in 1983 and culminating in 2008, the course of the Clark Fork River from Anaconda to the Milltown Dam was declared to be a Superfund cleanup site. Cleanup costs are financed from the settlement with ARCO (now BP-ARCO).

===Economic decline===
Interstate 90 bypassed Deer Lodge in 1960. In 1961, the Milwaukee Road ended its Olympian Hiawatha passenger trains. Limited passenger service between Minneapolis and Deer Lodge continued until 1964, at which time all Milwaukee Road passenger service to Deer Lodge ended.

In the 1970s, the Anaconda Copper Company suffered financial setbacks which ultimately caused its 1977 merger with ARCO. By 1982, ARCO had closed down the smelter at Anaconda and stopped mining copper at Butte. In 1980, the Milwaukee Road shut down its western extension. All of its infrastructure from Seattle, Washington to Miles City, Montana was torn out, including the rails themselves.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Small creeks can be found in and near town, such as Cottonwood Creek and Peterson Creek.

===Climate===

<text>Stevensville (Salish: ɫq̓éɫmlš) is a town in Ravalli County, Montana, United States. The population was 2,002 at the 2020 census.

Stevensville is officially recognized as the first permanent settlement of non-indigenous peoples in the state of Montana. Forty-eight years before Montana became the nation&#x27;s 41st state, Stevensville was settled by Jesuit Missionaries at the request of the Bitterroot Salish tribe.

==History==
The Bitterroot Valley is the ancestral homeland of the Bitterroot Salish people. Between 1812 and 1821, the Salish learned about the &quot;powerful medicine&quot; of Christianity and Jesuit missionaries from Iroquois fur traders. In 1831, four young Salish men were dispatched to St. Louis, Missouri, to request &quot;Black Robes&quot; for the tribe. The four Salish men were directed to the home and office of William Clark (of Lewis and Clark fame) to make their request. At that time Clark was in charge of administering the territory they called home. Through the perils of their trip, two of the Salish died at the home of General Clark. The remaining two Salish men secured a visit with St. Louis Bishop Joseph Rosati, who assured them that missionaries would be sent to the Bitterroot Valley when funds and missionaries were available in the future.

Again in 1835 and 1837 the Bitterroot Salish dispatched men to St. Louis to request missionaries, but to no avail. Finally in 1839 a group of Iroquois and Salish met Father Pierre-Jean De Smet in Council Bluffs. The meeting resulted in Fr. DeSmet promising to fulfill their request for a missionary the following year.

In 1841, DeSmet led a group of Jesuits to the Bitterroot and founded St. Mary&#x27;s Mission. It became the first permanent white settlement in what is now Montana. Construction of a chapel began immediately, followed by other permanent structures including log cabins. The settlement was the site of many of Montana&#x27;s &quot;firsts&quot;: irrigation, agriculture, ranching, and cattle branding. Father Ravalli, Jesuit priest and physician, arrived at the mission in 1845 and built the first pharmacy.

In 1850 Major John Owen arrived in the valley and set up camp north of St. Mary&#x27;s. When Blackfeet raids forced the closure of the mission, Owen bought it from the Jesuits and established a trading post called Fort Owen. The Jesuits later returned to the area and built a new church. Both St. Mary&#x27;s Mission and Fort Owen still have permanent structures that stand in present-day Stevensville, denoting its historical past starting in 1841.

The name of the settlement was changed from St. Mary&#x27;s to Stevensville in 1864 to honor territorial governor Isaac Stevens. In 1879, G. A. Kellogg platted the townsite. In 1891, the Bitterroot Salish who remained in the valley were forced to remove to the Flathead Indian Reservation. In 1893, Ravalli County was created, and Stevensville became the county seat until 1898, when the town lost the election to Hamilton. More than forty properties in Stevensville are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The city lies along the Yellowstone River. Sidney is approximately midway between Glendive, Montana and Williston, North Dakota.

==History==
Settlers began arriving in the area in the 1870s, and a post office was established in 1888. Six-year-old Sidney Walters and his parents were staying with Hiram Otis, the local justice of the peace, and Otis decided that Sidney was a good name for the town. The following year, Montana became a state and Sidney was incorporated in 1911.

Sidney was originally part of Dawson County, but became the county seat of Richland County at its inception in 1914.

Agriculture became an important part of the region after the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project was completed in 1909. A dam was built on the river south of Glendive, which diverted water from the river into a main canal, which runs north–south, parallel to the Yellowstone, irrigating land from Glendive north up to Fairview, where it drains into the Missouri River. This project irrigates and serves water to 450 farms, according to the manager of the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Districts.

During the Great Depression, Montana artist J. K. Ralston painted a Federal Arts Project mural at the Richland County Courthouse in Sidney.

The town received a boost in 1924 when the Holly Sugar Company opened up a sugar refinery in Sidney to process locally grown sugar beets.

The area experienced an oil boom and bust in the late 1970s and early 1980s, bringing an influx of people to the town for a short period of time. Around the start of the 21st century, the town experienced another surge in oil exploration activity.

<text>Culbertson is a town in Roosevelt County, Montana, United States. The population was 753 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Culbertson was created in June 1887 following the arrival of the Great Northern Railway, then known as the St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Manitoba Railway. The town was named after Major Alexander Culbertson, former head of the American Fur Company&#x27;s Fort Union, to the east.

The settlement of Culbertson followed hard on the heels of the 1886-87 watershed years for the early cattle industry. As a result, the first settlers in the area raised horses for the US Cavalry’s various Montana and Dakota posts. As cattle prices slowly rebounded, the range was once again stocked with cattle, though the second wave of cattlemen utilized hardy English breeds instead of the Texas longhorns of the earlier outfits.

With the passage of new homestead laws in 1909 enabling homesteaders to take out larger acreages, the area saw an influx of dryland farmers. With its railroad connection, Culbertson became the center of the area’s agricultural trade. When the agricultural boom went bust after World War II and never resumed its former glory, Culbertson saw a gradual decline in businesses and population. This was somewhat ameliorated by a heavy railroad presence in the community.

Culbertson also became a surviving center as smaller adjacent communities dried up in the agricultural depression of the 1920s and 1930s. With better automobiles and better roads, farmers and ranchers could live farther from centers of trade.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="123606" wikidata="Q959254" url="?curid=123606" title="Colstrip, Montana">
<text>Colstrip is a city in Rosebud County, Montana, United States. The population was 2,096 at the 2020 census. 

Established in 1924 and incorporated as a city in 1998, Colstrip is the largest city in Rosebud County with 25.2% of the total population in 2020. Colstrip&#x27;s primary industries are coal mining and electricity production. In 2005, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;’s 50th anniversary issue named Colstrip the top sports town in Montana. 
The entire community celebrates Colstrip Days annually on the weekend prior to the 4th of July.

== History ==
Colstrip was established by the Northern Pacific Railway in 1924 as a company town to provide coal for their steam locomotives. The mining at Rosebud Mine two miles south of the town is open pit strip mining, where draglines remove soil above the layer of bituminous coal from the Fort Union Formation.

During The Second World War, the Colstrip mine was identified as strategically important because it supplied coal for the Northern Pacific Railway steam locomotives hauling military equipment for the war effort. The mine was guarded from sabotage, and the employees were not allowed to quit their jobs.

In 1958, the railroad switched to using diesel locomotives and the Colstrip mine was shut down. In 1959, Montana Power Company purchased the rights to the mine and the town, and resumed mining operations in the 1970s with plans to build coal-fired electrical plants.

The power plants were built in the 1970s and 1980s by a collection of contractors including Bechtel. During this construction period, Colstrip was a boomtown, with a large increase in population. Plants 1 and 2 became operational in 1975 and 1976, and plants 3 and 4 became operational in 1984 and 1986.
In 1974, construction of Colstrip&#x27;s Castle Rock Lake (formerly named surge pond) was completed. The Colstrip plants produce electricity from coal using steam. The water for the steam is pumped in an underground pipe from the Yellowstone River and stored in the lake. The lake is stocked with fish and the home for a wide variety of wildlife.

In 1990, the Colstrip Energy Limited Project started commercial operations. Located six miles (10 km) north of Colstrip, this experimental electricity production facility is owned by Rosebud Energy Corp., a partnership that at one point included Enron. The plant uses high sulfur waste coal from the Rosebud Coal Mine&#x27;s topmost one foot layer of coal.

In 1998, plants 1-4 were sold to a group led by PPL Corporation (PPL)
and Puget Sound Energy
(PSE). The Rosebud Coal Mine was sold to Westmoreland Mining LLC.
In this same year, the City of Colstrip was incorporated.

In June 2015, PPL spun off its power generation assets including the Colstrip plants to become Talen Energy.
In 2016, Puget Sound Energy reached an agreement with the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center to shut down units 1 and 2 of the coal-fired generating plant by the year 2022. The agreement said nothing about the status of Units 3 and 4 at the generating station. However, the existing electrical transmission capacity that transmits power from Colstrip to the Pacific Northwest may be used to transmit wind energy. Another blow to Colstrip&#x27;s economy came when a proposed junction point from BNSF Railway to connect to Tongue River Railroad was dismissed.

In June 2019, Talen Energy announced the closure of two of the four coal burning units by the end of the year. The power plant is &quot;the sixth-largest source of greenhouse emissions in the U.S.&quot; Units 3 and 4 will remain in operation.

In January 2020, Puget Sound Energy announced that Unit 1 ceased operating in the &quot;first days of January&quot;, and Unit 2 ceased operating on January 4. Units 3 and 4 will remain operational as planned, but will be closed within the next five years.

In January 2023, Avista made a deal giving NorthWestern Energy their 15% share of the plant for free. The deal takes effect in 2025. A Washington state law bans use of coal-generated electricity, forcing Avista to relinquish their stake in the company.

<doc id="123610" wikidata="Q966608" url="?curid=123610" title="Heron, Montana">
<text>Heron is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sanders County, Montana, named for the village of Heron which is located within it. The population of the CDP was 173 at the 2020 census.

The town was built in 1883 by the Northern Pacific Railroad as a division point.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
Heron has a continental, quasi-Mediterranean climate (Dsb) that has more in common with northern Idaho and the Pacific Northwest than the rest of Montana. It has one of the wettest climates in the state (outside isolated mountain areas), averaging nearly of precipitation per year. Winters are wet and often snowy with occasional rain; summers are mostly dry with sunny, warm days and cool to chilly nights.

Another striking feature of Heron&#x27;s climate is the patterned, extremely large seasonal variation in diurnal temperature range: only 10-11 degrees in the wettest months, November through January, expanding to nearly 35 degrees in the driest months, July and August, reflecting prevalent low humidity during those months. Around 11 days per year reach 90 F., while 100 F. is a very rare occurrence. Nights are cool year round with freezes having been recorded in every month. On average, the lowest temperature each year is -12 F., placing Heron in hardiness zone 5B.

Average monthly precipitation is very high by Montana standards, especially in the wettest months of November through January, but Heron experiences continuing moderately wet conditions each month from February to June. In May and June, Heron shares with the rest of Montana some frequency of shower and thunderstorm activity, making these the wettest months in virtually all other areas of Montana, but not in Heron due to its exceptionally wet winters.

Overall, Heron&#x27;s average annual precipitation cycle is similar to that of the Pacific Northwest in its dry summer and wet winter (with a November maximum, as in Seattle, WA), but somewhat transitional into the typical Montana and Wyoming pattern of a May or June maximum, reflected in Heron&#x27;s continued relatively high rainfall those months. The combination of these factors with possible orographic lift results in Heron being one of the wettest locations in Montana, mostly a dry state elsewhere.

<doc id="123612" wikidata="Q172544" url="?curid=123612" title="John Rawls">
<text>John Bordley Rawls (; February 21, 1921 – November 24, 2002) was an American moral, legal and political philosopher in the modern liberal tradition. Rawls has been described as one of the most influential political philosophers of the 20th century.

In 1990, Will Kymlicka wrote in his introduction to the field that &quot;it is generally accepted that the recent rebirth of normative political philosophy began with the publication of John Rawls&#x27;s &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; in 1971&quot;. Rawls&#x27;s theory of &quot;justice as fairness&quot; recommends equal basic liberties, equality of opportunity, and facilitating the maximum benefit to the least advantaged members of society in any case where inequalities may occur. Rawls&#x27;s argument for these principles of social justice uses a thought experiment called the &quot;original position&quot;, in which people deliberately select what kind of society they would choose to live in if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy. In his later work &quot;Political Liberalism&quot; (1993), Rawls turned to the question of how political power could be made legitimate given reasonable disagreement about the nature of the good life.

Rawls received both the Schock Prize for Logic and Philosophy and the National Humanities Medal in 1999. The latter was presented by President Bill Clinton in recognition of how his works &quot;revived the disciplines of political and ethical philosophy with his argument that a society in which the most fortunate help the least fortunate is not only a moral society but a logical one&quot;.

Among contemporary political philosophers, Rawls is frequently cited by the courts of law in the United States and Canada and referred to by practicing politicians in the United States and the United Kingdom. In a 2008 national survey of political theorists, based on 1,086 responses from professors at accredited, four-year colleges and universities in the United States, Rawls was voted first on the list of &quot;Scholars Who Have Had the Greatest Impact on Political Theory in the Past 20 Years&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Rawls was born on February 21, 1921, in Baltimore, Maryland. He was the second of five sons born to William Lee Rawls, a prominent Baltimore attorney, and Anna Abell Stump Rawls. Tragedy struck Rawls at a young age:

Rawls&#x27;s biographer Thomas Pogge calls the loss of the brothers the &quot;most important events in John&#x27;s childhood.&quot;

Rawls graduated in Baltimore before enrolling in the Kent School, an Episcopalian preparatory school in Connecticut. Upon graduation in 1939, Rawls attended Princeton University, where he was accepted into The Ivy Club and the American Whig-Cliosophic Society. At Princeton, Rawls was influenced by Norman Malcolm, Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s student. During his last two years at Princeton, he &quot;became deeply concerned with theology and its doctrines.&quot; He considered attending a seminary to study for the Episcopal priesthood and wrote an &quot;intensely religious senior thesis (&quot;BI)&quot;.&quot; In his 181-page long thesis titled &quot;Meaning of Sin and Faith,&quot; Rawls attacked Pelagianism because it &quot;would render the Cross of Christ to no effect.&quot; Rawls graduated from Princeton in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;.

===Military service, 1943–46===
Rawls enlisted in the U.S. Army in February 1943. During World War II, Rawls served as an infantryman in the Pacific, where he served a tour of duty in New Guinea and was awarded a Bronze Star; and the Philippines, where he endured intensive trench warfare and witnessed traumatizing scenes of violence and bloodshed. It was there that he lost his Christian faith and became an atheist.

Following the surrender of Japan, Rawls became part of General MacArthur&#x27;s occupying army and was promoted to sergeant. But he became disillusioned with the military when he saw the aftermath of the atomic blast in Hiroshima. Rawls then disobeyed an order to discipline a fellow soldier, &quot;believing no punishment was justified,&quot; and was &quot;demoted back to a private.&quot; Disenchanted, he left the military in January 1946.

===Academic career===
In early 1946, Rawls returned to Princeton to pursue a doctorate in moral philosophy. He married Margaret Warfield Fox, a Brown University graduate, in 1949. They had four children: Anne Warfield, Robert Lee, Alexander Emory, and Elizabeth Fox.

Rawls received his PhD from Princeton in 1950 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;A Study in the Grounds of Ethical Knowledge: Considered with Reference to Judgments on the Moral Worth of Character&quot;. His PhD included a year of study at Cornell. Rawls taught at Princeton until 1952 when he received a Fulbright Fellowship to Christ Church at Oxford University, where he was influenced by the liberal political theorist and historian Isaiah Berlin and the legal theorist H. L. A. Hart. After returning to the United States, he served first as an assistant and then associate professor at Cornell University.

In the fall of 1953 Rawls became an assistant professor at Cornell University, joining his mentor Norman Malcolm in the Philosophy Department. Three years later Rawls received tenure at Cornell. During the 1959–60 academic year, Rawls was a visiting professor at Harvard, and he was appointed in 1960 as a professor in the humanities division at MIT. Two years later, he returned to Harvard as a professor of philosophy, and he remained there until reaching mandatory retirement age in 1991.

In 1962, he achieved a tenured position at MIT. That same year, he moved to Harvard University, where he taught for almost forty years and where he trained some of the leading contemporary figures in moral and political philosophy, including Sibyl A. Schwarzenbach, Thomas Nagel, Allan Gibbard, Onora O&#x27;Neill, Adrian Piper, Arnold Davidson, Elizabeth S. Anderson, Christine Korsgaard, Susan Neiman, Claudia Card, Rainer Forst, Thomas Pogge, T. M. Scanlon, Barbara Herman, Joshua Cohen, Thomas E. Hill Jr., Gurcharan Das, Andreas Teuber, Henry S. Richardson, Nancy Sherman, Samuel Freeman and Paul Weithman. He held the James Bryant Conant University Professorship at Harvard.

Rawls was, for a time, a member of the Mont Pèlerin Society. He was put forward for membership by Milton Friedman in 1968, and withdrew from the society three years later, just before his &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; was published.

===Later life===
Rawls rarely gave interviews and, having both a stutter (partially caused by the deaths of two of his brothers, who died through infections contracted from Rawls) and a &quot;bat-like horror of the limelight,&quot; did not become a public intellectual despite his fame. He instead remained committed mainly to his academic and family life.

In 1995, he had the first of several strokes, severely impeding his ability to continue to work. He was nevertheless able to complete &quot;The Law of Peoples&quot;, the most complete statement of his views on international justice. Published in 2001 shortly before his death was &quot;Justice as Fairness: A Restatement&quot;, a response to criticisms of &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;. Rawls died from heart failure at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts, on November 24, 2002, at age 81. He was buried at the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife, four children, and four grandchildren.

==Philosophical thought==

Rawls published three main books. The first, &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, focused on distributive justice and attempted to reconcile the competing claims of the values of freedom and equality. The second, &quot;Political Liberalism&quot;, addressed the question of how citizens divided by intractable religious and philosophical disagreements could come to endorse a constitutional democratic regime. The third, &quot;The Law of Peoples&quot;, focused on the issue of global justice.

===&quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;===

&quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, published in 1971, aimed to resolve the seemingly competing claims of freedom and equality. The shape Rawls&#x27;s resolution took, however, was not that of a balancing act that compromised or weakened the moral claim of one value compared with the other. Rather, his intent was to show that notions of freedom and equality could be integrated into a seamless unity he called &quot;justice as fairness&quot;. By attempting to enhance the perspective which his readers should take when thinking about justice, Rawls hoped to show the supposed conflict between freedom and equality to be illusory.

Rawls&#x27;s &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; (1971) includes a thought experiment he called the &quot;original position.&quot; The intuition motivating its employment is this: the enterprise of political philosophy will be greatly benefited by a specification of the correct standpoint a person should take in their thinking about justice. When we think about what it would mean for a just state of affairs to obtain between persons, we eliminate certain features (such as hair or eye color, height, race, etc.) and fixate upon others. Rawls&#x27;s original position is meant to encode all of our intuitions about which features are relevant, and which irrelevant, for the purposes of deliberating well about justice.

The original position is Rawls&#x27;s hypothetical scenario in which a group of persons is set the task of reaching an agreement about the kind of political and economic structure they want for a society, which they will then occupy. Each individual, however, deliberates behind a &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;: each lacks knowledge, for example, of their gender, race, age, intelligence, wealth, skills, education and religion. The only thing that a given member knows about themselves is that they are in possession of the basic capacities necessary to fully and willfully participate in an enduring system of mutual cooperation; each knows they can be a member of the society.

Rawls posits two basic capacities that the individuals would know themselves to possess. First, individuals know that they have the capacity to form, pursue and revise a conception of the good, or life plan. Exactly what sort of conception of the good this is, however, the individual does not yet know. It may be, for example, religious or secular, but at the start, the individual in the original position does not know which. Second, each individual understands themselves to have the capacity to develop a sense of justice and a generally effective desire to abide by it. Knowing only these two features of themselves, the group will deliberate in order to design a social structure, during which each person will seek their maximal advantage. The idea is that proposals that we would ordinarily think of as unjust—such as that black people or women should not be allowed to hold public office—will not be proposed, in this, Rawls&#x27;s original position, because it would be &quot;irrational&quot; to propose them. The reason is simple: one does not know whether he himself would be a woman or a black person. This position is expressed in the difference principle, according to which, in a system of ignorance about one&#x27;s status, one would strive to improve the position of the worst off, because he might find himself in that position.

Rawls develops his original position by modeling it, in certain respects at least, after the &quot;initial situations&quot; of various social contract thinkers who came before him, including Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Each social contractarian constructs their initial situation somewhat differently, having in mind a unique political morality they intend the thought experiment to generate. Iain King has suggested the original position draws on Rawls&#x27;s experiences in post-war Japan, where the US Army was challenged with designing new social and political authorities for the country, while &quot;imagining away all that had gone before.&quot;

In social justice processes, each person early on makes decisions about which features of persons to consider and which to ignore. Rawls&#x27;s aspiration is to have created a thought experiment whereby a version of that process is carried to its completion, illuminating the correct standpoint a person should take in their thinking about justice. If he has succeeded, then the original position thought experiment may function as a full specification of the moral standpoint we should attempt to achieve when deliberating about social justice.

In setting out his theory, Rawls described his method as one of &quot;reflective equilibrium,&quot; a concept which has since been used in other areas of philosophy. Reflective equilibrium is achieved by mutually adjusting one&#x27;s general principles and one&#x27;s considered judgements on particular cases, to bring the two into line with one another.

====Principles of justice====
Rawls derives two principles of justice from the original position. The first of these is the Liberty Principle, which establishes equal basic liberties for all citizens. &#x27;Basic&#x27; liberty entails the (familiar in the liberal tradition) freedoms of conscience, association and expression as well as democratic rights; Rawls also includes a &quot;personal property&quot; right, but this is defended in terms of moral capacities and self-respect, rather than an appeal to a natural right of self-ownership (this distinguishes Rawls&#x27;s account from the classical liberalism of John Locke and the libertarianism of Robert Nozick).

Rawls argues that a second principle of equality would be agreed upon to guarantee liberties that represent meaningful options for all in society and ensure distributive justice. For example, formal guarantees of political voice and freedom of assembly are of little real worth to the desperately poor and marginalized in society. Demanding that everyone have exactly the same effective opportunities in life would almost certainly offend the very liberties that are supposedly being equalized. Nonetheless, we would want to ensure at least the &quot;fair worth&quot; of our liberties: wherever one ends up in society, one wants life to be worth living, with enough effective freedom to pursue personal goals. Thus, participants would be moved to affirm a two-part second principle comprising Fair Equality of Opportunity and the famous (and controversial) difference principle. This second principle ensures that those with comparable talents and motivation face roughly similar life chances and that inequalities in society work to the benefit of the least advantaged.

Rawls held that these principles of justice apply to the &quot;basic structure&quot; of fundamental social institutions (such as the judiciary, the economic structure and the political constitution), a qualification that has been the source of some controversy and constructive debate (see the work of Gerald Cohen). Rawls&#x27;s theory of justice stakes out the task of equalizing the distribution of primary social goods to those least advantaged in society and thus may be seen as a largely political answer to the question of justice, with matters of morality somewhat conflated into a political account of justice and just institutions. Relational approaches to the question of justice, by contrast, seek to examine the connections between individuals and focuses on their relations in societies, with respect to how these relationships are established and configured.

Rawls further argued that these principles were to be &#x27;lexically ordered&#x27; to award priority to basic liberties over the more equality-oriented demands of the second principle. This has also been a topic of much debate among moral and political philosophers.

Finally, Rawls took his approach as applying in the first instance to what he called a &quot;well-ordered society ... designed to advance the good of its members and effectively regulated by a public conception of justice.&quot; In this respect, he understood justice as fairness as a contribution to &quot;ideal theory,&quot; the determination of &quot;principles that characterize a well-ordered society under favorable circumstances.&quot;

===&quot;Political Liberalism&quot;===


In &quot;Political Liberalism&quot; (1993), Rawls turned towards the question of political legitimacy in the context of intractable philosophical, religious, and moral disagreement amongst citizens regarding the human good. Such disagreement, he insisted, was reasonable—the result of the free exercise of human rationality under the conditions of open enquiry and free conscience that the liberal state is designed to safeguard. The question of legitimacy in the face of reasonable disagreement was urgent for Rawls because his own justification of Justice as Fairness relied upon a Kantian conception of the human good that can be reasonably rejected. If the political conception offered in &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; can only be shown to be good by invoking a controversial conception of human flourishing, it is unclear how a liberal state ordered according to it could possibly be legitimate.

The intuition animating this seemingly new concern is actually no different from the guiding idea of &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, namely that the fundamental charter of a society must rely only on principles, arguments and reasons that cannot be reasonably rejected by the citizens whose lives will be limited by its social, legal, and political circumscriptions. In other words, the legitimacy of a law is contingent upon its justification being impossible to reasonably reject. This old insight took on a new shape, however, when Rawls realized that its application must extend to the deep justification of Justice as Fairness itself, which he had presented in terms of a reasonably rejectable (Kantian) conception of human flourishing as the free development of autonomous moral agency.

The core of Political Liberalism is its insistence that in order to retain its legitimacy, the liberal state must commit itself to the &quot;ideal of public reason.&quot; This roughly means that citizens in their public capacity must engage one another only in terms of reasons whose status &quot;as&quot; reasons is shared between them. Political reasoning, then, is to proceed purely in terms of &quot;public reasons.&quot; For example: a Supreme Court justice deliberating on whether or not the denial to homosexuals of the ability to marry constitutes a violation of the 14th Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause may not advert to his religious convictions on the matter, but he may take into account the argument that a same-sex household provides sub-optimal conditions for a child&#x27;s development. This is because reasons based upon the interpretation of sacred text are non-public (their force as reasons relies upon faith commitments that can be reasonably rejected), whereas reasons that rely upon the value of providing children with environments in which they may develop optimally are public reasons—their status as reasons draws upon no deep, controversial conception of human flourishing.

Rawls held that the duty of civility—the duty of citizens to offer one another reasons that are mutually understood as reasons—applies within what he called the &quot;public political forum.&quot; This forum extends from the upper reaches of government—for example the supreme legislative and judicial bodies of the society—all the way down to the deliberations of a citizen deciding for whom to vote in state legislatures or how to vote in public referendums. Campaigning politicians should also, he believed, refrain from pandering to the non-public religious or moral convictions of their constituencies.

The ideal of public reason secures the dominance of the public political values—freedom, equality, and fairness—that serve as the foundation of the liberal state. But what about the justification of these values? Since any such justification would necessarily draw upon deep (religious or moral) metaphysical commitments which would be reasonably rejectable, Rawls held that the public political values may only be justified privately by individual citizens. The public liberal political conception and its attendant values may and will be affirmed publicly (in judicial opinions and presidential addresses, for example) but its deep justifications will not. The task of justification falls to what Rawls called the &quot;reasonable comprehensive doctrines&quot; and the citizens who subscribe to them. A reasonable Catholic will justify the liberal values one way, a reasonable Muslim another, and a reasonable secular citizen yet another way. One may illustrate Rawls&#x27;s idea using a Venn diagram: the public political values will be the shared space upon which overlap numerous reasonable comprehensive doctrines. Rawls&#x27;s account of stability presented in &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; is a detailed portrait of the compatibility of one—Kantian—comprehensive doctrine with justice as fairness. His hope is that similar accounts may be presented for many other comprehensive doctrines. This is Rawls&#x27;s famous notion of an &quot;overlapping consensus.&quot;

Such a consensus would necessarily exclude some doctrines, namely, those that are &quot;unreasonable&quot;, and so one may wonder what Rawls has to say about such doctrines. An unreasonable comprehensive doctrine is unreasonable in the sense that it is incompatible with the duty of civility. This is simply another way of saying that an unreasonable doctrine is incompatible with the fundamental political values a liberal theory of justice is designed to safeguard—freedom, equality and fairness. So one answer to the question of what Rawls has to say about such doctrines is—nothing. For one thing, the liberal state cannot justify itself to individuals (such as religious fundamentalists) who hold to such doctrines, because any such justification would—as has been noted—proceed in terms of controversial moral or religious commitments that are excluded from the public political forum. But, more importantly, the goal of the Rawlsian project is primarily to determine whether or not the liberal conception of political legitimacy is internally coherent, and this project is carried out by the specification of what sorts of reasons persons committed to liberal values are permitted to use in their dialogue, deliberations and arguments with one another about political matters. The Rawlsian project has this goal to the exclusion of concern with justifying liberal values to those not already committed—or at least open—to them. Rawls&#x27;s concern is with whether or not the idea of political legitimacy fleshed out in terms of the duty of civility and mutual justification can serve as a viable form of public discourse in the face of the religious and moral pluralism of modern democratic society, not with justifying this conception of political legitimacy in the first place.

Rawls also modified the principles of justice as follows (with the first principle having priority over the second, and the first half of the second having priority over the latter half):

# Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of basic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and only those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.
# Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first, they are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

These principles are subtly modified from the principles in &quot;Theory&quot;. The first principle now reads &quot;equal claim&quot; instead of &quot;equal right&quot;, and he also replaces the phrase &quot;system of basic liberties&quot; with &quot;a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties&quot;. The two parts of the second principle are also switched, so that the difference principle becomes the latter of the three.

===&quot;The Law of Peoples&quot;===

Although there were passing comments on international affairs in &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, it was not until late in his career that Rawls formulated a comprehensive theory of international politics with the publication of &quot;The Law of Peoples&quot;. He claimed there that &quot;well-ordered&quot; peoples could be either &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;decent&quot;. Rawls&#x27;s basic distinction in international politics is that his preferred emphasis on a society of peoples is separate from the more conventional and historical discussion of international politics as based on relationships between states.

Rawls argued that the legitimacy of a liberal international order is contingent on tolerating &quot;decent peoples&quot;, which differ from &quot;liberal peoples&quot;, among other ways, in that they might have state religions and deny adherents of minority faiths the right to hold positions of power within the state and might organize political participation via consultation hierarchies rather than elections. However, no well-ordered peoples may violate human rights or behave in an externally aggressive manner. Peoples that fail to meet the criteria of &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;decent&quot; peoples are referred to as &#x27;outlaw states&#x27;, &#x27;societies burdened by unfavorable conditions&#x27; or &#x27;benevolent absolutisms&#x27;, depending on their particular failings. Such peoples do not have the right to mutual respect and toleration possessed by liberal and decent peoples.

Rawls&#x27;s views on global distributive justice as they were expressed in this work surprised many of his fellow egalitarian liberals. For example, Charles Beitz had previously written a study that argued for the application of Rawls&#x27;s Difference Principles globally. Rawls denied that his principles should be so applied, partly on the grounds that a world state does not exist and would not be stable. This notion has been challenged, as a comprehensive system of global governance has arisen, amongst others in the form of the Bretton Woods system, that serves to distribute primary social goods between human beings. It has thus been argued that a cosmopolitan application of the theory of justice as fairness is the more reasonable alternative to the application of The Law of Peoples, as it would be more legitimate towards all persons over whom political coercive power is exercised.

According to Rawls however, nation states, unlike citizens, were self-sufficient in the cooperative enterprises that constitute domestic societies. Although Rawls recognized that aid should be given to governments which are unable to protect human rights for economic reasons, he claimed that the purpose for this aid is not to achieve an eventual state of global equality, but rather only to ensure that these societies could maintain liberal or decent political institutions. He argued, among other things, that continuing to give aid indefinitely would see nations with industrious populations subsidize those with idle populations and would create a moral hazard problem where governments could spend irresponsibly in the knowledge that they will be bailed out by those nations who had spent responsibly.

Rawls&#x27;s discussion of &quot;non-ideal&quot; theory, on the other hand, included a condemnation of bombing civilians and of the American bombing of German and Japanese cities in World War II, as well as discussions of immigration and nuclear proliferation. He also detailed here the ideal of the statesman, a political leader who looks to the next generation and promotes international harmony, even in the face of significant domestic pressure to act otherwise. Rawls also controversially claimed that violations of human rights can legitimize military intervention in the violating states, though he also expressed the hope that such societies could be induced to reform peacefully by the good example of liberal and decent peoples.

==Influence and reception==

Despite the exacting, academic tone of Rawls&#x27;s writing and his reclusive personality, his philosophical work has exerted an enormous impact on not only contemporary moral and political philosophy but also public political discourse. During the student protests at Tiananmen Square in 1989, copies of &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; were brandished by protesters in the face of government officials. Despite being approximately 600 pages long, over 300,000 copies of that book have been sold, stimulating critical responses from utilitarian, feminist, conservative, libertarian, Catholic, communitarian, Marxist and Green scholars.

Although having a profound influence on theories of distributive justice both in theory and in practice, the generally anti-meritocratic sentiment of Rawls&#x27;s thinking has not been widely accepted by the political left. He consistently held the view that naturally developed skills and endowments could not be neatly distinguished from inherited ones, and that neither could be used to justify moral desert. Instead, he held the view that individuals could &quot;legitimately expect&quot; entitlements to the earning of income or development of abilities based on institutional arrangements. This aspect of Rawls&#x27;s work has been instrumental in the development of such ideas as luck egalitarianism and unconditional basic income, which have themselves been criticized. The strictly egalitarian quality of Rawls&#x27;s second principle of justice has called into question the type of equality that fair societies ought to embody.

In a 2008 national survey of political theorists, based on 1,086 responses from professors at accredited, four-year colleges and universities in the United States, Rawls was voted first on the list of &quot;Scholars Who Have Had the Greatest Impact on Political Theory in the Past 20 Years&quot;.

=== Communitarian critique ===
Charles Taylor, Alasdair Macintyre, Michael Sandel, and Michael Walzer produced a range of critical responses contesting the universalist basis of Rawls&#x27; original position. While these criticisms, which emphasize the cultural and social roots of normative political principles, are typically described as communitarian critiques of Rawlsian liberalism, none of their authors identified with philosophical communitarianism. In his later works, Rawls attempted to reconcile his theory of justice with the possibility that its normative foundations may not be universally applicable.

=== September Group ===
The late philosopher G. A. Cohen, along with political scientist Jon Elster, and John Roemer, used Rawls&#x27;s writings extensively to inaugurate the Analytical Marxism movement in the 1980s.

=== Frankfurt School ===
In the later part of Rawls&#x27;s career, he engaged with the scholarly work of Jürgen Habermas (see Habermas-Rawls debate). Habermas&#x27;s reading of Rawls led to an appreciation of Rawls&#x27;s work and other analytical philosophers by the Frankfurt School of critical theory, and many of Habermas&#x27;s own students and associates were expected to be familiar with Rawls by the late 1980s. The Leibniz Prize-winning political philosopher Rainer Forst was advised by both Rawls and Habermas in completing his PhD. Axel Honneth, Fabian Freyenhagen, and James Gordon Finlayson have also drawn on Rawls&#x27;s work in comparison to Habermas.

=== Feminist political philosophy ===
Philosopher Eva Kittay has extended the work of John Rawls to address the concerns of women and cognitively disabled people.

===Later developments in liberalism===
Amartya Sen critiques and attempts to revitalize &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; in &quot;The Idea of Justice&quot; (2009). He praises Rawls for revitalizing interest in the topic of justice and defends his focus on fairness, but also argues that a focus on abstract, ideal scenarios detracts from finding practical solutions to injustice, as well as arguing for alternatives to Rawls&#x27;s thought experiments and focus on institutions. In his book &quot;Free and Equal&quot; (2023), the economist and philosopher Daniel Chandler argued that Rawls had been &quot;overlooked within mainstream political debate&quot; despite his profound influence in academia, which he attributed to Rawls&#x27;s reclusive personality, the abstract nature of his work and the rise of neoliberalism in the 1980s. Chandler argued that Rawls&#x27;s foremost achievement was creating a theory that could support both freedom and equality, respectively the core tenets of classical liberalism and socialism, and that his ideas remain relevant today.

<text>Antelope is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sheridan County, Montana, United States. The population was 51 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Named for the nearby creek, Antelope began as a tiny community along the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s Bainville to Scobey branch line in 1910. That year, John and Richard Grayson built a hardware store next to the Antelope Creek Lutheran Church. A post office, bank, lumberyard, and saloon soon followed. The town was incorporated in 1913. The community thrived during its first decade, adding general mercantiles, a butcher shop, a concrete plant, restaurants, and other businesses to serve the region&#x27;s growing homesteader population. Over the years, however, better roads to the south siphoned off business, and the “Biggest Little City in Eastern Montana” sank into decline.

In 1967 a U.S. Navy gunboat was named the &quot;Antelope&quot;. To mark the occasion crew members came to the town of Antelope and some of the town&#x27;s citizens went to Tacoma, Washington.

The school graduated 522 students from 1922 to 1979 (the 1979 graduating class was graduated at Plentwyood school but consider Antelope school their Alma mater).

===Centennial Celebration===
Antelope celebrated 100 years as a community on July 3, 2010. They had a parade, lunch, a skit about the history of town, and a street dance, among time for people to catch up with one another and blow up games for the kids in the park. The bar was also re-opened for the celebration as a gathering place and place to get a drink.

<text>Plentywood is a city in and the county seat of Sheridan County, Montana, United States. The population was 1,669 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1881, Sitting Bull and his band surrendered to US forces roughly at what is now Plentywood.

Butch Cassidy and other rustlers used a trail through Plentywood to move their stolen cattle into Canada. The plentiful gulches provided coverage for the outlaws. The Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 sparked an increase in Montana homesteaders, including in the Plentywood area. Claiming this land forced some of the outlaws away.

The first business in Plentywood opened in 1900, and a post office was established two years later. The city incorporated in 1912, following the arrival of a Great Northern Railway branch line that eventually ran from Bainville to Opheim. 

Local folklore suggests that the name of the nearby Plentywood Creek, after which the city was named, comes from a search for firewood. One day, according to the story, a group of cowboys watched in exasperation as the chuck wagon cook attempted to start a fire with damp buffalo chips. Finally, in frustration, Dutch Henry said, &quot;If you&#x27;ll go two miles up this creek, you&#x27;ll find plenty wood.&quot;

During the 1920s, Plentywood became nationally renowned due to the rise of communists to elected positions in both Plentywood and Sheridan County. As one historian put it, &quot;three decades before Senator Joseph McCarthy tried to inspire hysteria in the hearts of Americans with the specter of creeping Communist control, radicals in Sheridan County had already accomplished what McCarthyites perhaps feared most: they had created a community where &#x27;Reds&#x27; occupied every elected office in the county.&quot; Though the moment had mostly collapsed by late 1932, it has received renewed interest since the publication of a book on the topic in 2010.

<text>Walkerville is a town in Silver Bow County, Montana, United States, that is an enclave of the consolidated city-county of Butte. The population was 639 at the 2020 census. Walkerville is a suburb of Butte, and the only other incorporated community in the county, as well as the only part of the county that is not part of Butte.

Part of Walkerville is included in the Butte-Anaconda Historic District. Walkerville represents some of the earliest mines in the district and preserves the early mining camp flavor present in the 1890s to 1910s.

==History==
Walkerville is a suburb of Butte, Montana and is home to some of the earliest mining sites in the area. These sites attracted many investors to Walkerville in the late 1800s. Walkerville is named for four of those investors: brothers Joseph, Samuel, Matthew and David Walker of Salt Lake City; they had purchased the lucrative Alice mine upon recommendation by their agent (and later Copper King) Marcus Daly.

There were many different types of materials mined depending on the location of a given site. Copper and silver were two of the most commonly mined materials. In 1893, silver prices dropped, but the town&#x27;s economy continued to thrive due to its copper production. The town incorporated in 1890, and by the early 1900s almost 2,500 people lived there, mostly Cornish and Irish immigrants who came to work in the mines. Walkerville&#x27;s economic success continued until 1918 when the end of World War I caused copper prices to drop.

In 1955, the Anaconda Company decided to begin open-pit mining operations, which transformed Walkerville. Residents opposed open-pit mining on the grounds that it took away jobs. But extracting metals was cheaper with the open pit method, and as copper prices dropped after World War II, the old Alice Mine transformed into the Alice Pit. Blasting in the pit, located in the middle of Walkerville, angered residents who complained of noise, flying rocks, and cracking basements. The Anaconda Company offered to buy property at fair market prices and sold homes back to residents for one dollar on the stipulation that the home be moved. Many residents moved away. When the blasting and digging rendered Sibyl, Rose, and Pearl streets impassable, they were condemned and fenced off. Mayor Jimmy Shea responded by demanding that the Company formally petition the city council to discontinue and vacate the streets. With this leverage, the city council demanded the Company pay to repair city utilities, build a new road, repair damaged streets, build safety fences, keep the pit one hundred feet from homes, and build a new ballpark. Eventually, the Company acquiesced to most of these demands. Even so, Walkerville&#x27;s fight with the Company became more bitter as the pit continued to expand. In 1961, the City of Walkerville sued Anaconda for damaging city property. The Alice Pit never reopened.

By 2015, nearly all of the town&#x27;s many mines are abandoned. Some of these sites have become very dangerous and plans are being made to restore or remove them.

==Geography==
Berkeley Pit is to the south. The town is on the U.S. Continental Divide.

<doc id="123628" wikidata="Q832600" url="?curid=123628" title="Absarokee, Montana">
<text>Absarokee is a census-designated place (CDP) in Stillwater County, Montana, United States, approximately south of Columbus on Highway 78. It is named after the Crow Indians who formerly inhabited the land. The population was 1,000 at the 2020 census. The Stillwater Mine, operated by the Stillwater Mining Company, is located near Absarokee.

==Name==
The name Absarokee is derived from &quot;Apsáalookěi&quot;, the name given to the Crow Indian Tribe by the related Hidatsa people with &quot;Apsáa&quot; meaning &quot;large-beaked bird&quot; and &quot;lookěi&quot; meaning &quot;children&quot;. &quot;Apsáalookěi&quot; thus literally means &quot;children of the large-beaked bird&quot;. (The name &quot;Crow&quot; comes from the French &quot;gens du corbeaux&quot; or &quot;people of the crows&quot; as &quot;Apsáalookěi &quot;was translated by French fur traders in 1743.) The name was chosen by Absarokee-founder Sever T. Simonson who believed it meant &quot;our people&quot;. It is widely believed that the difference in spelling of Absarokee from the nearby Absaroka Range is a result of the poor penmanship of an early settler whose final &quot;a&quot; in the name was mistaken for &quot;ee&quot;. Though pronounced &quot;Ub-ZOR-kee&quot; in modern parlance, Eli Ricker in one of his &quot;Indian Interviews&quot; from 1903-1919 ends a record of an interview with Frank S. Shively, Assistant Clerk at Crow Agency, with &quot;Absarokee Ab-sar&#x27;-o-kee&quot;.

==History==
Absarokee was founded just north of the Second Crow Agency (sometimes referred to as the Absaroka Agency) in 1892. The Crow Agency was the headquarters of the Crow Tribe&#x27;s reservation, which was established by the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). That original reservation extended to more than 35 million acres with the first Crow Agency located at Fort Parker near modern Livingston, Montana in 1869.

As miners encroached, the reservation was reduced to 8 million acres in 1875 with a location south of modern Absarokee established as Second Crow Agency (1875-1884). It was during this time that the Crow were forced to give up nomadic free lifestyles to one totally under the control of the US government. They were not allowed to leave the reservation, bison was replaced with US issued beef rations, and the tribe was hit by several measles and scarlet fever epidemics. Finally, by 1884 further miner encroachment led to the creation of the third and current Crow Agency 60 miles SE of Billings on the Little Bighorn River. Most of the Absaroka Agency Fort was destroyed in a fire in 1891.

With the Homestead Acts of the 1860s and the westward expansion of the railroad, more settlers came to Montana. Not until October 15, 1892, did the federal government through a Benjamin Harrison proclamation open the land around Absarokee for settlement. It was part of a 1.8 million-acre land cession agreed to by Crow tribal leaders two years earlier after bowing to political pressure. Eleven days earlier on October 4, Sever Simonson and his family had arrived and established squatter&#x27;s rights at the confluence of the Stillwater and East Rosebud Rivers.

Simonson and his nephew, Oliver H. Hovda, built a log hotel and together established a trading post (later the Absarokee Cooperative Trading Co.). This was followed by a saloon, livery stable, and blacksmith shop. A post office was established December 16, 1892 in Simonson&#x27;s home, where he served as Absarokee&#x27;s postmaster. The two-story home of Hovda, known as the Big Yellow House, built in 1904 by an area rancher, Jacob Wagner, is located on Absarokee&#x27;s main street (Woodard Ave.) and is on the National Register of Historic Places list.

Absarokee was affected by the 2022 Montana floods when the Stillwater River flooded.

==Geography==
Absarokee is located in a valley of the Beartooth Mountains foothills. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

The nearby Stillwater Mine has a great effect on the population of the area. Although the population remains relatively constant with a slight increase, mining families are generally more transient than the local farming community so a slight change around town and especially at the schools is ever present.

== Education==

Absarokee has two school locations. The elementary school is located on the south side of town in the former high school. Two older buildings on the campus are no longer used for educational purposes. The new high school (1989) is shared by both the junior high school and high school students.

Absarokee High School is a class C school (less than 108 students) which helps determine athletic competitions. The most notable difference in class C schools is that they play eight-man football, which is basically eleven-man football with no tackles and one split-end instead of two wide receivers.

Absarokee&#x27;s sport teams are called the Huskies and the school colors are orange and black.

==Media==
The &quot;Stillwater County News&quot; is a newspaper serving the area. It is printed weekly and also available online.

The town receives radio and television from the wider Billings area.

==History==
Reed Point was named after Harry Reed who, with his wife, Alice McCleary Reed, ran a stage station for several years.

About 1876, attracted by the reports of the Black Hills stampede, the Reeds went overland with a covered wagon. After a short sojourn around Spearfish, South Dakota, they joined an expedition going to the Big Horn and Yellowstone valley in the summer of 1877. The caravan was attacked by Native Americans while it was still in the Black Hills country, and several of its members were killed.

Their party was later joined by another, led by Dr. W.A. Allen. Their travels across the plains were marked by other encounters with Native Americans and by many hardships. The party reached the Yellowstone River about the time Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce tribe made their raid through this section and fought the Battle of Canyon Creek.

While Harry Reed worked with a timber crew, Alice Reed worked at several ranches and stage stations along the Yellowstone River. About 1878, the Reed&#x27;s went to Coulson, Montana, where Harry Reed was employed in carrying mail to Fort Custer. He narrowly escaped death by drowning in a freshet of Pryor Creek, but his health was so impaired that he died several months later. The young and widowed Alice Reed made a living by washing clothes until, in April, 1881, she remarried to John Schock, a Civil War veteran who was in charge of the McAdow Ferry at Coulson.

In 1901, the post office was established as Reed, but the name was changed to Reed Point in 1906. Bob Guthrie plotted the townsite in 1911 and a new bridge spanned the Yellowstone River the same year.

<text>Fairfield is a town in Teton County, Montana, United States. The population was 759 at the 2020 census. Fairfield is the self-proclaimed &quot;Malting Barley Capital of the World&quot; due to their large crops each year of malt barley.

Fairfield is a trade center for the farming community. Companies located there include Busch Agricultural Resources, 3 Rivers Telephone Cooperative and Sun River Electric Cooperative.

==History==
Fairfield began as a station on the Milwaukee Railroad.

Even though the federal government opened Montana to homesteading in 1862, this area was not initially settled. Given Montana&#x27;s vast and dry landscape, irrigation was necessary. In 1902 irrigation projects began, which did lead to increased grain production. Then in 1903 the Bureau of Reclamation conducted a survey of the area. The potential of the Sun River Valley was deemed so great it was promoted as “the greatest farming country under the dome of Heaven.” In 1909 homestead size was increased from 160 acres to 320 acres. This change began drawing many more settlers to Montana.

By 1920, three dams and an extensive system of canals were created. The Gibson Dam and reservoir were completed in 1929. Today, Greenfield Irrigation District delivers water from Gibson Dam to approximately 83,000 acres surrounding this community.

Initially the name &quot;Freeze-out Bench&quot; was applied to the area. With irrigation the area produces abundant crops. &quot;Greenfield Bench&quot; and Fairfield now describe the hay and grain fields in the Sun River Valley.

==Geography==
Fairfield is located between Great Falls and Choteau on Highway 89. Freezout Lake, an important bird migration site, is 5 miles to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Fairfield has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

On December 14, 1924, Fairfield set the record for the largest 12-hour temperature drop in the United States when it went from 63 degrees at noon to minus 21 degrees at midnight.

<text>Hysham is a town in and the county seat of Treasure County, Montana, United States. The population was 276 at the 2020 census.

==History==
When the Montana Territory became the state of Montana in 1889 the future site of Hysham was just a blank spot in the rolling prairie along the Yellowstone River. At that time, the area was within sprawling Custer County, which covered much of eastern Montana, and also included the eastern part of the Crow Indian Reservation. The area was opened up to homesteading in 1906 after the federal government moved the Crow Indian Reservation boundary further west to its present location. This made possible the development of farms and ranches throughout the area and at the same time allowed the settlement of small towns like Hysham (Cheney 1984).

The location and founding of the town of Hysham is intertwined with its ranching and railroad history. A large cattle ranch, the Flying E, ran thousands of heads of cattle in the region. Charlie J. Hysham had moved from the town of Red Oak, Iowa, to manage the ranch. In order to facilitate the delivery of the large amounts of supplies the Flying E ranch required, the Northern Pacific Railroad built a siding to unload goods and materials that Hysham had ordered from Billings and Forsyth. In 1907, the siding became the nucleus for the town of Hysham. (Cheney 1984; Kimball 1976).

James O. Lockard built the first building on the future site of Hysham shortly after the area was open to homesteading. Later, his homestead south of the railroad tracks would become the &quot;Lockard Addition&quot; in Hysham. The general store was located north of the railroad tracks and also served as Hysham&#x27;s first post office with Lockard appointed the first postmaster. Hysham slowly grew by a general process typical throughout the frontier where an initial commercial or transportation need would establish the site, which would then grow as settlers homesteaded nearby. This would, in turn, resulted in the need for other commercial enterprises followed by schools, churches, banks, government and other civic institutions (Cheney 1984; Kimball 1976; Sanborn 1920).

In 1906 there were two stores, a lumber yard and a blacksmith shop. The first school at the growing community was built in 1908. Ada Channel, who had a homestead near the railroad siding, became the school&#x27;s first teacher. She was also a key figure in the formation of Hysham. This same year, she worked to locate a town site with the help of James Lockard and F. L. Baker. The three town founders plotted town lots on of Channel&#x27;s homestead. E. C. Sampson completed the process with a survey, which established the town&#x27;s streets. Two other additions were added later. The First Addition added south of the original site and the Rogers Addition was established north of the railroad depot. Even though Charlie Hysham had moved away from the area by this time, the new town was named Hysham in his honor. The town was officially incorporated in 1916 (Sanborn 1920: Kimball 1976; Cheney 1984).

As more families were attracted to the area, more businesses were established. Town mayor, James Lyndes, started a real estate business with C. M. Patterson and opened a law office. He served as the first County Attorney and Hysham&#x27;s first Mayor. Lyndes&#x27; wife Mary Alice served as chairman of the school board and for the first few years, the high school was held above the Lyndes and Patterson store. Also among the first town&#x27;s residents were F. L. and Christiania Baker. Baker owned a threshing machine and did custom threshing (Kimball 1976).

Another phase of the community development process usually occurred after the initial settlers became established and then encouraged friends and relatives to move to the area. Such was the case with the Lyndes family. After James Lyndes set up his law and real estate business, four of his brothers: Bert, Wallace, Elmer and C. W. &quot;Kid&quot; and their families, became some of the earliest Hysham residents (Kimball 1976).

With the growth of commercial and agricultural businesses came the need for banks to finance the economic growth. The first bank in Hysham was the First National Bank, established in 1910, with J. W. Wagner serving as president. The bank continued to serve the community for more than half a century. Five years later, C. C. Jordan gambled on the boom caused by World War I and opened the Treasure State Bank. However, this bank was not as fortunate as its predecessor and ran into hard times with the post-war recession and a brutal winter in 1919, which severely damaged many of the area&#x27;s cattle ranches. It was forced to close in 1922, which further hurt many local ranchers who had invested heavily in the bank (Kimball 1976).

For the most part, however, the 1910s were a period of prosperity. Hysham boasted of concrete sidewalks with modern infrastructure including electric lights, telephone, water, and sewer. New businesses included an International Harvester dealership, a drug store, a hotel, the Pin-Con confections and ice cream parlor, a hardware business, a grocery store, the Rosebud Flour mill, a grain elevator, a butcher shop, a bakery, the Hysham Echo newspaper, a barber shop and pool hall as well as other enterprises. Besides new businesses, the decade saw the establishment of many social institutions such as the Hysham Community Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Hysham School, the Hysham Women&#x27;s Club and the Buffington Hall, which was used for dances, basketball games, community meetings and other programs until it burned down in 1939 (Kimball 1976; Cheney 1984).

Another development, which occurred during the 1910s, was the improvement of the area&#x27;s road system. In 1914, the Montana State Highway Commission placed the &quot;Yellowstone Trail&quot; county road between Custer and Hysham on the Federal-Aid highway system. The road eventually followed a county road that ran just south of the Yellowstone River, crossing it over the Myers Bridge, which was a multi-span steel through truss span built in 1907. Other roads were either constructed or improved during this period (Axline 1991).
Symbolic of this perseverance in the face of adversity, was the construction of the Yucca Theatre in 1931 by local businessman and politician, David M. Manning and his brother Jim Manning, just when the nationwide depression was at its nadir. This striking building is in the Mission style, which may have been the result of Manning&#x27;s time spent in the Southwest where he would have seen similar buildings. However, it was unique to the Hysham area and undoubtedly was a source of civic pride to the community and does to this day show movies every Sunday. (U.S. Department of Interior 1993).

Manning went on to become the owner or part owner of five different businesses; he helped build the city swimming pool and city water system; he built two dams in the Hysham area and improved the irrigation system. In addition to his many projects and businesses in Hysham, he also served in the Montana legislature where he was instrumental in promoting rural electrification and highway construction (U.S. Department of Interior 1993). After 52 continuous years of service (1933–1985), he retired as Dean of the Montana Senate and senior state legislator in the nation (Andrea Merrill-Maker, Montana Almanac, p. 159).

In 1867, company employee Abe Farwell constructed the Fort Peck trading post along the Missouri River, which enjoyed a virtual monopoly in trade with the Sioux and Assiniboine people. After its short life as a trading post, Fort Peck served as an Indian agency from 1873 until 1878. At that time, the agency was moved to its current location at Poplar. Fort Peck had a post office from 1879 to 1881.

A new town of Fort Peck, located approximately two miles north of the original, was built in 1934 to house Army Corps of Engineers employees involved in the construction of the Fort Peck Dam. Designed to be temporary, the government-owned town nevertheless included many features of a permanent town, including an administrative headquarters, a hospital, stores, a theater, a recreation hall, and other facilities. Totally inadequate to house the 10,000-plus employees, Fort Peck was soon joined by numerous shanty towns, including Wheeler, New Deal, Delano Heights, and Park Grove. The Fort Peck Original Houses Historic District, the Fort Peck Theatre, and the hospital, administration building, and other associated public works properties are listed in the National Register.


The Administration Building, the Employee&#x27;s Hotel and Garage, the Garage and Fire Station, the Hospital, and the Recreation Hall of the government-run town are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Fort Peck draws people from hundreds of miles away to recreate around Fort Peck Reservoir. Most popular is utilizing the lake and dredge cuts for boating, swimming, and fishing. Camping and barbecuing are very popular and facilities for camping and cooking are well developed.

Besides the lake, Fort Peck offers several more activities. The Fort Peck Theatre performs plays during the summer and draws large crowds. The Fort Peck Interpretive Center shows the history of the area, from the dinosaurs to the dam.

<text>Glasgow is a city in and the county seat of Valley County, Montana, United States. The population was 3,202 at the 2020 census.

Despite being just the 23rd most populous city in Montana, Glasgow is the most populous city for over , thus making it an important economic hub for a large region in Eastern Montana. Both Amtrak and the National Weather Service operate facilities in Glasgow that link the city to the surrounding region.

==History==

Native Americans inhabited the region for centuries, and extensive buffalo and pronghorn antelope herds provided ample food for the nomadic tribes. The Nakoda, Lakota, and Dakota peoples alternately inhabited and claimed the region from the 16th to the late 19th centuries. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition came within of the future site of Glasgow and noted the extensive herds of buffalo and various game. In 1851, the US government formed the first treaty with the Native American tribes, in 1885 the tribes engaged in the last known buffalo hunt in the region. 

From 1885 to Montana Statehood in 1889, the tribes participated in agreements with the US government to re-drawing the Fort Peck reservation boundaries in exchange for federal subsidies. As more and more homesteaders moved into the surrounding areas, pressure was placed on Congress to open up the Fort Peck Reservation to homesteading, resulting in tribes leaving the Glasgow area.

Glasgow was founded in 1887 as a railroad town by James Hill, who was responsible for creating many communities along the Hi-Line. He and a local railroader named the town when they spun a globe with a finger landing on Glasgow, Scotland. Glasgow grew during the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Fort Peck Dam, which became a major source of employment for the Glasgow area.

During World War II, the Glasgow Army Airfield housed the 96th Bombardment Squadron and 614th Bombardment Squadron, flying B-17 Flying Fortresses, at different times during the war. Starting in December 1944, a German POW camp was established at the facility, lasting until the end of the war. After the war ended the base was closed, and part of the facility eventually became the present day Glasgow Valley County Airport. Glasgow was the death place of Lieutenant Colonel Ronald Speirs, famed member of Easy Company, 101st Airborne.

In the 1960s, the population rose to about 6,400 due to the nearby presence of the Glasgow Air Force Base, (SAC air command and housing B-52 bombers) used during the Vietnam War and the earlier part of the Cold War. A significant amount of mid-century modern and Googie-style architecture was built then. After the de-activation and closure of the base in 1969, Glasgow&#x27;s population declined to about half its one-time size by 1990, when the loss rate stabilized. Glasgow still functions as the major regional administrative, shopping and services hub for Valley County and some of the areas beyond.

Russell National Wildlife Refuge surrounds the lake providing an opportunity to experience nearly the same surroundings as encountered by the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805.

Using data from Oxford University&#x27;s Big Data Institute, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in 2018, identified Glasgow as &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot; for the contiguous United States.

When the Air Force base was decommissioned, the on-base housing was purchased and offered for sale to private individuals. While many of the bids for the houses were from salvage companies, the community ultimately escaped demolition. Homes which had housed thousands of military personnel when the base was in operation were briefly promoted as condominiums for retirees.

Despite local efforts, most of the re-purposed housing units sit empty and abandoned. A few hundred residents remain in what is otherwise a partial ghost town. The runway remains in use as Glasgow Industrial Airport (FAA LID: 07MT), a test site for Boeing aircraft. The nearby city of Glasgow, Montana has dropped in population by half (from 6400 in the 1960s to 3250 in 2010) after the base closure.

Beginning in 2012 the community became embroiled in a series of legal and political conflicts with an anti-government group called the &quot;Citizens Action Committee of Valley County,&quot; part of the larger Sovereign Citizen movement, with a similar philosophy to that of the Montana Freemen. The group intended to take ownership of the community though buying and seizing up a large amount of mostly vacant properties though bogus liens and litigation, while ostensibly planning a handful of investment schemes to redevelop them. The situation led to a number of St. Marie property owners being sued and a community backlash against the group followed.
The post office and town hall are still in operation along with a small handful of local businesses, but the school and a majority of businesses have closed. St. Marie has gained some interest from ghost town enthusiasts and back road explorers in recent years for its uniquely Atomic Age appeal, being much more intact and modern than most vacated locales and containing a fair number of larger buildings. In 2024, the town was used as a filming location for the short film &quot;Orchards of a Futile Heaven.&quot;

<text>Harlowton is a city in and the county seat of Wheatland County, Montana, United States. The population was 955 at the 2020 census.

The city was once the eastern terminus of electric operations (1914–74) for the &quot;Pacific Extension&quot; of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (&quot;Milwaukee Road&quot;). Here, steam or diesel locomotives were changed or hooked up to electric locomotives for trip through the Rocky Mountains to Avery, Idaho. Harlowton was founded in 1900 as a station stop on the Montana Railroad, a predecessor to the Milwaukee, and was named for Richard A. Harlow, the Montana Railroad&#x27;s president.

==History==
The Upper Musselshell River Valley is named for the Musselshell River, which got its name from the large number of freshwater mussels found in its river bed. In the fall and winter weather, the bison would migrate to the lower altitudes along the Musselshell River. Early plains hunters, taking advantage of the large bison population, frequented this area. Some of the tribes that traveled through the area were the Crow, Blackfeet, Flathead, Gros Ventre, Northern Cheyenne, Nez Perce, Shoshones, Sioux, and Assiniboine.

Harlowton lies within the Montana High Plains that form a part of the Northwestern Plains. The area is most known archeologically for the line of demarcation which was mutually established between the Crow and Blackfeet tribes that passed through the area. This fifty-mile rock line fence crossed east to west from the Big Snowy Mountains to the Crazy Mountains. The rock line hunting boundary was the cause of several battles in the area.

Within Wheatland County, site surveys have recorded and assigned archaeological site numbers to Sentinel Rock, the Fish Creek Pictograph, Owl Canyon Pictograph, Winnecook Petroglyph, Fortification site, and to several buffalo jumps in the area. The Big Snowy, Little Belt, Castle and Crazy Mountains have produced five wickiup (conical timbered lodges) sites and several pictograph sites.

On May 7, 1868, a treaty with the Crow Nation and the United States Government opened the Musselshell River Valley to settlement.

The first sheep operation on the Upper Musselshell was started by P.J. Moore in 1878. The first large cattle operation in the area was the Chicago Montana Livestock Company in 1882, with S.S. Hobson as part owner and manager.

On June 17, 1907, a fire destroyed 24 buildings on the north side of Harlowton&#x27;s Main Street. The town was rebuilt, though most of the construction took place on Central Avenue to correspond with the Milwaukee Railroad plot.

The first town election was held on June 6, 1908. Mr. A. T. Anderson was elected mayor.

The grand opening of the Graves Hotel was on June 19, 1909, with a banquet and dance. Andrew Chris Graves was the principal owner. The Graves Hotel was added to the National register of historic places on August 6, 1980.
On February 22, the 1917 legislature passed an act which created Wheatland County from Meagher and Sweet Grass Counties. The act took effect on April 1, 1917. W

Wheatland was the first county in the US to go over its goal in the World War I Liberty Bond drive of 1918. County became the 41st county in Montana, and Harlowton became the county seat. For this effort, a ship, the , was named after the county.

The 163rd Infantry Regiment is a regiment of the Montana National Guard based in Harlowton. It went overseas with the 41st Infantry Division in World War II.

The Jawbone Creek Country Club is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only golf course with a cemetery in it.

===Merino===

The town of Merino was officially established in 1881. The name Merino came from the breed of sheep (Merino) that were run in the area by Charles Severance at the time. The trading post owned by John and Archie McEachnie housed the post office, store and saloon. The first railroad into the area was the Montana Railroad (nicknamed the “Jawbone Railroad”) in 1899. The Montana Railroad terminal was located one mile northwest of Merino, so it was decided to relocate the town site. On June 10, 1900 Richard Harlow, father of the Montana Railroad, and Arthur Lombard, surveyor and promoter of the Montana Railroad, auctioned off lots of the new town site.

The name Merino was changed to Harlowton on November 9, 1900. The first building to be erected in the new town site was a barber shop, owned by Thomas Hanzlik.

===Big Nose George robbery===
In 1878, JV Salazar (Mexican John) was robbed of his horses, grub, and guns near the present site of Harlowton by the noted horse thief George Parrott (Big Nose George). At the time of the Salazar robbery, George Parrott was known to be camping on the Musselshell River with Andrew Garcia, where he was holding a bunch of stolen horses on his way to Canada. Big Nose George was later lynched at Rawlins, Wyoming.

===Milwaukee Road===
In 1906, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (&quot;Milwaukee Road&quot;) started building west with its route coming though Harlowton. On December 5, 1907, work was started on the Milwaukee Railroad Roundhouse in Harlowton. The first passenger train from the east rolled into Harlowton on March 9, 1908, with freight trains to follow. In 1915 the Milwaukee Railroad was electrified from Harlowton to Avery, Idaho — over 450 mountainous miles. Harlowton became the eastern terminus of electric operations and was known as “the place where electricity replaces steam.” The Milwaukee Railroad dropped its electrified system in 1974, just months before the OPEC oil embargo of the United States. The Milwaukee Railroad was abandoned following a bankruptcy settlement and the last train that went through Harlowton was in March 1980. Milwaukee Road Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1988. The depot has been converted into the Harlowton Milwaukee Depot Museum.

==Paleontology==
The town of Harlowton is located in the Fort Union Geological formation and is famous for its Paleocene fossils. In 1902 Albert Silberling, a local homesteader and self-taught paleontologist, discovered the Douglass Quarry southwest of Harlowton. Albert Silberling and Earl Douglass, a Princeton University paleontologist, discovered fossil remains of primitive mammals including the Ptilodus, Phenacodus, and Plesiadapis in the quarries southwest of Harlowton. Albert Silberling&#x27;s discoveries from fossils excavated in the Harlowton area have subsidized the information about life in the Paleozoic era.

The &quot;Rugocaudia cooneyi&quot; and &quot;Tatankacephalus cooneyorum&quot; are two new dinosaur species that were found southwest of Harlowton. The &quot;Rugocaudia cooneyi&quot; is a new sauropod dinosaur that was described and named by the paleontologist Cary Woodruff in 2012. The genus name &quot;Rugocaudia&quot; means “wrinkle tail” and the species name honors the landowner J. P. Cooney. The &quot;Tatankacephalus&quot; is a new ankylosaur dinosaur species found in 1997 by Bill and Kris Parsons, research associates of the Buffalo Museum of Science.

The &quot;Avaceratops lammersi&quot; dinosaur was found on the Lammers family Careless Creek Ranch northeast of Harlowton and is the first of its kind. The &quot;Aveceratops&quot; is a small horned dinosaur that belongs to the Ceratopsidaie family. Eddie and Ava Cole discovered the fossil remains in 1981. Dr. Peter Dodson, Professor of Paleontology and Veterinary Anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania, participated in further excavation and transported the specimen to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. A cast of the &quot;Avaceratops lammersi&quot; is on display at the Upper Musselshell Museum in Harlowton.

<text>Wibaux ( ) is a town in and the county seat of Wibaux County, Montana, United States. It is the only incorporated town in Wibaux County. The population was 462 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The town originally had names such as Keith, Beaver, and Mingusville (named for Minnie and Gus Grisy, who ran the Post Office in the late 19th century). In 1895, the town was renamed for prominent local cattle rancher, Pierre Wibaux, who had immigrated to the area from France in 1883. Wibaux expanded his herds by buying stock from less fortunate ranchers.

After Wibaux&#x27;s arrival, the town became a major cattle shipping center for the Northern Pacific Railroad, notably receiving some of the cattle from Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Maltese Cross and Elkhorn ranches near Medora, North Dakota. The great cattle drives of the 1880s often passed by Wibaux on their way from Texas to the northern ranges.

Theodore Roosevelt had a famous encounter with a bully at Nolan&#x27;s Hotel in Wibaux (Mingusville, at the time) shortly after moving to the North Dakota Badlands in 1884. Arriving at the hotel late at night, Roosevelt was accosted by a drunk sheep herder carrying cocked revolvers in both hands, and ordered to buy drinks for the crowd. Roosevelt pretended to move towards the bar, then punched the man three times in quick succession, causing the drunk to fire his revolvers as he fell. The future president then took away the man&#x27;s guns before several other occupants of the hotel dragged him out into a shed.
==Geography==
Wibaux is located at Montana&#x27;s border to North Dakota.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

<text>Ballantine is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yellowstone County, Montana, United States. It lies approximately nine miles (14 km) northeast of Billings on Interstate 94. The population was 346 at the 2000 census. Ballantine, along with the communities of Pompey&#x27;s Pillar, Worden, and Huntley, is part of the Huntley Project, an irrigation district created by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The majority of Ballantine&#x27;s population lives on scattered farms and ranches surrounding the actual townsite.

==History==
Ballantine was founded on land that had been part of the Crow Indian Reservation. In 1896, the Burlington &amp; Missouri River Railroad established Ballantine as a station, named for homesteader E. P. Ballantine. By 1907 the town had a post office and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad had taken over rail operations.

It was in 1907 that Ballantine became part of a federally funded irrigation district, the Huntley Project. Irrigation slowly changed the sagebrush landscape into farms growing sugar beets, alfalfa, and other crops. The population grew slowly and included many European immigrants. Both Catholic and Lutheran religious services were held here, and a Congregational Church was built. The Anita Dam and Reservoir project, about six miles southeast of Ballantine, was completed in 1937 by Civilian Conservation Corps workers.

<text>Billings is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Montana, with a population of 117,116 as of the 2020 census. Located in the south-central portion of the state, it is the seat of Yellowstone County and the principal city of the Billings Metropolitan Area, which had a population of 184,167 in the 2020 census. With one of the largest trade areas in the United States, Billings is the trade and distribution center for much of Montana east of the Continental Divide. Billings is also the largest retail destination for much of the same area. The Billings Chamber of Commerce claims the area of commerce covers more than . In 2009, it was estimated to serve over 500,000 people.

Billings was nicknamed the &quot;Magic City&quot; because of its rapid growth from its founding as a railroad town in March 1882. The nearby Crow and Cheyenne peoples call the city &quot;Ammalapáshkuua&quot; and &quot;É&#x27;êxováhtóva&quot; respectively, meaning &#x27;where they cut wood&#x27;, named as such because of a sawmill built in the area by early white settlers. The city has experienced rapid growth and maintains a strong economy. From 1969 to 2021, the Billings area population growth was 89%, compared to Montana&#x27;s overall increase of 59%. Parts of the metro area are seeing hyper growth. From 2000 to 2010 Lockwood, an eastern suburb, saw growth of 57.8%, the largest growth rate of any community in Montana. In 2020, the area experienced its highest growth rate in a decade with a 2.3% increase. Billings avoided the economic downturn that affected most of the nation from 2008 to 2012 as well as the housing bust. With more hotel accommodations than any area within a five-state region, the city hosts a variety of conventions, concerts, sporting events, and other rallies. With the nearby Bakken oil development, the largest oil discovery in U.S. history, as well as the Heath Shale oil discovery north of Billings, the city&#x27;s growth rate stayed high during the shale oil boom.

Attractions in and around Billings include ZooMontana, the Yellowstone Art Museum, Pompey&#x27;s Pillar, Pictograph Cave, Chief Plenty Coups State Park, Little Bighorn Battlefield, Bighorn Canyon, Red Lodge Mountain, and the Beartooth Highway. The northeast entrance to Yellowstone National Park is a little over from Billings.

==History==
===Name===
The city is named for Frederick H. Billings, a former president of the Northern Pacific Railroad from Woodstock, Vermont. An earlier name for the area was Clark&#x27;s Fork Bottom.

The Crow people from the nearby Crow Indian Reservation call the city . It means &#x27;where they cut wood&#x27;, and is named as such because of a sawmill built in the area by early white settlers. The Cheyenne from the nearby Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation refer to the city as and the Gros Ventre from the nearby Fort Belknap Indian Reservation refer to it as , both also named for the sawmill, or translations of the Crow name.

===Prehistory===
The downtown core and much of the rest of Billings is in the Yellowstone Valley, a canyon carved out by the Yellowstone River. Around 80 million years ago, the Billings area was on the shore of the Western Interior Seaway. The sea deposited sediment and sand around the shoreline. As the sea retreated, it left a deep layer of sand. Over millions of years, this sand was compressed into stone known as Eagle Sandstone. Over the last million years the river has carved its way down through this stone to form the canyon walls known as the Billings Rimrocks or the Rims.

The Pictograph Caves are about five miles south of downtown. These caves contain over 100 pictographs (rock paintings), the oldest of which is over 2,000 years old. Approximately 30,000 artifacts (including stone tools and weapons) have been excavated from the site. These excavations have proven the area has been occupied since at least 2600 BC until after AD 1800.

The Crow Indians have called the Billings area home since about 1700. The present-day Crow Nation is just south of Billings.

===Lewis and Clark Expedition===
In July 1806, William Clark (of the Lewis and Clark Expedition) passed through the Billings area. On July 25 he arrived at what is now known as Pompey&#x27;s Pillar and wrote in his journal &quot;... at 4 P M arrived at a remarkable rock, i ascended this rock and from its top had a most extensive view in every direction.&quot; Clark carved his name and the date into the rock, leaving the only remaining physical evidence of their expedition. He named the place Pompey&#x27;s Tower, naming it after the son of his Shoshone interpreter and guide Sacajawea. In 1965, Pompey&#x27;s Pillar was designated as a national historic landmark, and was proclaimed a national monument in January 2001. An interpretive center has been built next to the monument.

===Coulson/Billings===
The area where Billings is today was known as Clark&#x27;s Fork Bottom. Clark&#x27;s Fork Bottom was to be the hub for hauling freight to Judith and Musselshell Basins. At the time these were some of the most productive areas of the Montana Territory. The plan was to run freight up Alkali Creek, now part of Billings Heights, to the basins and Fort Benton on the Hi-Line.

In 1877, settlers from the Gallatin Valley area of the Montana Territory formed Coulson the first town of the Yellowstone Valley. The town was started when John Alderson built a sawmill and convinced PW McAdow to open a general store and trading post on land Alderson owned on the bank of the Yellowstone River. The store went by the name of Headquarters, and soon other buildings and tents were being built as the town began to grow. At this time before the coming of the railroad, most goods coming to and going from the Montana Territory were carried on paddle riverboats. It is believed it was decided to name the new town Coulson in an attempt to attract the Coulson Packet Company that ran riverboats between St Louis and many points in the Montana Territory. In spite of their efforts the river was traversed only once by paddle riverboat to the point of the new town.

Coulson was a rough town of dance halls and saloons and not a single church. The town needed a sheriff and the famous mountain man John &quot;Liver-Eating&quot; Johnson took the job. Many disagreements were settled with a gun in the coarse Wild West town. Soon a graveyard was needed and Boothill Cemetery was created. It was called Boothill because most of the people in it were said to have died with their boots on. Today, Boothill Cemetery sits within Billings&#x27; city limits and is the only remaining physical evidence of Coulson&#x27;s existence.

When the railroad came to the area, Coulson residents were sure the town would become the railroads hub and Coulson would soon be the Territories largest city. The railroad only had claim to odd sections and it had two sections side-by-side about two miles west of Coulson. Being able to make far more money by creating a new town on these two sections the railroad decided to create the new town of Billings, the two towns existed side by side for a short time with a trolley even running between them. However, most of Coulson&#x27;s residents moved to the new booming town of Billings. In the end Coulson faded away with the last remains of the town disappearing in the 1930s. Today Coulson Park, a Billings city park, sits on the river bank where Coulson once was.

===Early railroad town===
Named after the Northern Pacific Railway president Frederick H. Billings, the city was founded in 1882. The Railroad formed the city as a western railhead for its further westward expansion. At first the new town had only three buildings but within just a few months it had grown to over 2,000. This spurred Billings&#x27; nickname of the Magic City because, like magic, it seemed to appear overnight.

The nearby town of Coulson appeared a far more likely site. Coulson was a rough-and-tumble town where arguments were often followed by gunplay. Liver-Eating Johnson was a lawman in Coulson. Perhaps the most famous person to be buried in Coulson&#x27;s Boothill cemetery is H.M. &quot;Muggins&quot; Taylor, the scout who carried the news of Custer&#x27;s Last Stand at the Battle of Little Bighorn to the world. Most buried here were said to have died with their boots on. The town of Coulson had been on the Yellowstone River, which made it ideal for the commerce steamboats brought up the river. However, when the Montana &amp; Minnesota Land Company oversaw the development of potential railroad land, they ignored Coulson, and platted the new town of Billings just a couple of miles to the northwest. Coulson quickly faded away; most of her residents were absorbed into Billings. Yet, for a short time, the two towns coexisted; a trolley even ran between them. But ultimately there was no future for Coulson as Billings grew. Though it stood on the banks of the Yellowstone River only a couple of miles from the heart of present-day downtown Billings, the city of Billings never built on the land where Coulson once stood. Today Coulson Park sits along the banks of the Yellowstone where the valley&#x27;s first town once stood.

===20th century===

By the 1910 census, Billings&#x27; population had risen to 10,031, ranking it the sixth fastest-growing community in the nation. Billings became an energy center in the early years of the twentieth century with the discovery of oil fields in Montana and Wyoming. Then the discovery of large natural gas and coal reserves secured the city&#x27;s rank as first in energy. In the early 20th century, its served as regional trading center and energy hub for eastern Montana and northern Wyoming, an area then known as the Midland Empire.

After World War II, Billings became the region&#x27;s major financial, medical and cultural center. Billings has had rapid growth from its founding; in its first 50 years growth was, at times, as high as 200 to 300 percent per decade.

Billings growth has remained robust throughout the years. In the 1950s, it growth rate was 66 percent. The 1973 oil embargo by OPEC spurred an oil boom in eastern Montana, northern Wyoming and western North Dakota. With this increase in oil production, Billings became the headquarters for energy sector companies. In 1975 and 1976, the Colstrip coal-fire generation plants 1 and 2 were completed; plants 3 and 4 started operating in 1984 and 1986.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Billings saw major growth in its downtown core; the first high-rise buildings to be built in Montana were erected. In 1980, the 22-floor Sheraton Hotel was completed. Upon its completion, it was declared &quot;the tallest load-bearing brick masonry building in the world&quot; by the Brick Institute of America. During the 1970s and 1980s, other major buildings were constructed in the downtown core; the Norwest Building (now Wells Fargo), Granite Tower, Sage Tower, the MetraPark arena, the TransWestern Center, many new city-owned parking garages, and the First Interstate Center, the tallest building in Montana.

With the completion of large sections of the interstate system in Montana in the 1970s, Billings became a shopping destination for an ever-larger area. The 1970s and 1980s saw new shopping districts and shopping centers developed in the Billings area. In addition to the other shopping centers, two new malls were developed, and Rimrock Mall was redeveloped and enlarged, on what was then the city&#x27;s west end. Cross Roads Mall was built in Billings Heights, and West Park Plaza mall in midtown. Several new business parks were also developed on the city&#x27;s west end during this period.

Billings was affected by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in May; the city received about of ash on the ground. The Yellowstone fires of 1988 blanketed Billings in smoke for weeks.

In the 1990s, the service sector in the city increased with the development of new shopping centers built around big box stores which built multiple outlets in the Billings area. With the addition of more interchange exits along I-90, additional hotel chains and service industry outlets are being built in Billings. Development of business parks and large residential developments on the city&#x27;s west end, South Hills area, Lockwood, and the Billings Heights were all part of the 1990s. Billings received the All-America City Award in 1992.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, Billings saw the development of operations centers in the city&#x27;s business parks and downtown core by such national companies as GE, Wells Fargo, and First Interstate Bank. The Downtown Billings Alliance led efforts to transform downtown in order to increase economic and civic opportunities. In 2002, Skypoint was completed. This artistic structure provides a defining area to host events. Downtown saw a renaissance of the historic area as building after building was restored. In 2007, Billings was designated a Preserve America Community.

Various changes were made to make the city more environmentally friendly. The MET Transit Center for city buses received LEED Platinum status in 2010. This was the first transportation facility in the US to do so. In 2022, Billings received LEED Gold certification, the first city to do so in Montana and the 21st globally. Projects to achieve this status included increased efficiency at the water and waste water treatment plant, adding electric city buses and EV charging stations, and adding a conservation area to the west-end.

Significant road developments began, providing infrastructure for city growth. In 2000, a new exit on Interstate 90 was completed. Zoo Drive exit provides ease of access to the quickly growing west-end area. The Yellowstone River bridge is being rebuilt as part of the Billings Bypass project, which will create a new arterial roadway from Lockwood to the Heights.

The city saw a significant growth in businesses. With the completion of the Shiloh interchange exit, the TransTech Center was developed and more hotels were built. In 2010 the Shiloh corridor was open for business with the completion of the Shiloh parkway, a multi-lane street with eight roundabouts. Other new centers include Billings Town Square and West Park Promenade, Montana&#x27;s first open-air shopping mall. In 2009, &quot;Fortune Small Business&quot; magazine named Billings the best small city in which to start a business. 

On June 20, 2010 (Father&#x27;s Day), a tornado touched down in the downtown core and Heights sections of Billings. The MetraPark Arena and area businesses suffered major damage.

In the 2010s, Eastern Montana and North Dakota experienced an energy boom due to the Bakken formation, the largest oil discovery in U.S. history.

==Geography==


Two-thirds of the city is in the Yellowstone Valley and the South Hills area and one-third in the Heights-Lockwood area. The city is divided by the Rims, long cliffs, also called the Rimrocks. The Rims run to the north and east of the downtown core, separating it from the Heights to the north and Lockwood to the east, with the cliffs to the north being tall and to the east of downtown, the face rises . The elevation of Billings is above sea level. The Yellowstone River runs through the southeast portion of the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Around Billings, seven mountain ranges can be viewed. The Bighorn Mountains have over 200 lakes and two peaks that rise to over : Cloud Peak, at and Black Tooth Mountain, at . The Pryor Mountains directly south of Billings rise to a height of and are unlike any other landscape in Montana. They are also home the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range. The Beartooth Mountains are the location of Granite Peak, which at is the highest point in the state of Montana.

===Climate===

Downtown Billings has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;) bordering on a cold semi arid climate (Köppen: &quot;Bsk&quot; ), with dry, hot summers, and cold, dry winters. However, areas outside of downtown can have a hot-summer continental climate, even with the isotherm, due to the urban heat island effect, as exemplified by the Billings Logan International Airport. The city even surprisingly barely reaches a humid subtropical climate (Koppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) when using the isotherm. In the summer, the temperature can rise to over on an average of 1 to 3 days per year, while the winter will bring temperatures below on an average of 12.9 days per year. The snowfall averages a year, but because of warm chinook winds that pass through the region during the winter, snow does not usually accumulate heavily or remain on the ground for long: the greatest depth has been on April 5, 1955, after a huge storm which dumped of water equivalent precipitation as snow in the previous three days under temperatures averaging .

The snowiest year on record was 2017–18, with , topping the 2013–14 previous record of . The first freeze of the season on average arrives by October 6 and the last is May 5. Spring and autumn in Billings are usually mild, but brief. Winds, while strong at times, are considered light compared with the rest of Montana and the Rocky Mountain Front.

Due to its location, Billings is susceptible to severe summer weather as well. On June 20, 2010, a tornado touched down in the Billings Heights and Downtown sections of the city. The tornado was accompanied by hail up to golf ball size, dangerous cloud-to-ground lightning, and heavy winds. The tornado destroyed a number of businesses and severely damaged the 12,000-seat MetraPark Arena.

As Billings quickly became the region&#x27;s economic hub, it outgrew the other cities in the region. The Billings trade area serves over a half million people. A major trade and distribution center, the city is home to many regional headquarters and corporate headquarters. Because Montana has no sales tax, Billings is a retail destination for much of Wyoming, North and South Dakota as well as much of Montana east of the Continental Divide. $1 out of every $7 spent on retail purchases in Montana is spent in Billings. The percentage of wholesale business transactions done in Billings is even stronger: Billings accounts for more than a quarter of the wholesale business for the entire state (these figures do not include Billings portion of sales for Wyoming and the Dakotas).

The Billings Bus Terminal is served by Express Arrow, Greyhound, and Jefferson Lines, which also provide regional and interstate bus service.

====Trail system====
Billings has an extensive trail system running throughout the metro area. The rapidly expanding trail system, known as the Heritage trail system, has a large variety of well-maintained trails and pathways.

====Highways====
Interstate 90 runs east–west through the southern portion of Billings, serving as a corridor between Billings Heights, Lockwood, Downtown, South Hills, Westend, Shiloh, and Laurel. East of Downtown, between Billings Heights and Lockwood, Interstate 90 connects with Interstate 94, which serves as an east–west corridor between Shepherd, Huntley, Lockwood, Downtown, South Hills, Westend, Shiloh, and Laurel via its connection with I-90.

Montana Highway 3 is a north–south highway that runs along the edge of the North Rims connecting Downtown and the West End with the Rehberg Ranch, Indian Cliffs and Billings Heights. U.S. Highway 87 runs through the center of Billings Heights and is known as Main Street within the city limits. This is the busiest section of roadway in the state of Montana. It connects to U.S. Highway 87 East, which runs through Lockwood as Old Hardin Road.

The 2012 Billings area I-90 corridor planning study recommended many improvements to the corridor from Laurel through Lockwood, such as the addition of lanes and the reconstruction of many of the bridges, interchanges and on-off ramps. These recommendations are being implemented via the I-90 Yellowstone River Project, which will widen the corridor to three lanes between the North 27th Street and Lockwood interchanges, and the East Laurel–West Billings project, which includes multiple upgrades between the Mossman (East Laurel) and West Billings interchanges. Both projects are slated for completion in 2024.

The Billings Bypass will create a new and more direct connection between the Billings Heights and Lockwood by connecting I-90 with Montana Highway 87 and Old Highway 312. The project will include a new bridge over the Yellowstone River (completed in 2023) and the reconstruction of the I-90 Johnson Lane Interchange. The Billings Bypass is tentatively set for completion in 2027.

====Rail====
There is currently no service, though until 1979 Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;North Coast Hiawatha&quot; stopped at the Billings Depot, serving a Chicago to Seattle route. Before Amtrak, Billings was well-served by Northern Pacific, Great Northern, and Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy railroads with direct routes to Kansas City, Denver, Chicago, Great Falls, and the West Coast. (Billings was the northern and western terminus for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad).

The Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority was formed in 2020 to advocate for restoring Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;North Coast Hiawatha&quot; route. In 2023, the organization was awarded $500,000 by the Corridor Identification and Development Program to explore the proposal&#x27;s logistics and feasibility. The &quot;North Coast Hiawatha&quot; received further recognition from its identification in the 2024 Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study.

===Healthcare===
The city&#x27;s rapidly growing health care sector employed nearly 13,000 people in 2012; they earned $641 million in wages, or about 20 percent of all wages in the city. Employment doubled in 25 years and wage rates in constant dollars grew by 162 percent. The city has two hospitals with Level I Trauma Center status: St. Vincent Regional Hospital and Billings Clinic.

St. Vincent Regional Hospital was founded in 1898 by the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth as St. Vincent Hospital. The name was changed to the present name in 2024. In 2011, the hospital and its 30 clinics employed approximately 2,100 people and received more than 400,000 patient visits each year. In 2022, the hospital announced plans to build a new 295-bed facility as a replacement for its current building. The following year, it achieved Level I Trauma Center status. It is the second largest hospital in the state, behind Billings Clinic. St. Vincent Regional Hospital is run by Intermountain Health, which operates over 30 hospitals across the mountain west, including two others in Montana.

Billings Clinic started in 1911 as the general practice of Dr. Arthur J. Movius. By 1939, three new general practitioners had joined Dr. Movius&#x27;s practice and the name was changed to The Billings Clinic. Billings Deaconess Hospital (founded in 1907) merged with Billings Clinic in 1990 to form the current hospital. Billings Clinic now employs over 4,500 people, including nearly 600 physicians, and is one of the largest employers in Montana.

===Public safety===
The Billings Police Department is the main law enforcement agency in Billings. It is the largest city police force in Montana, with about 162 sworn officers and 80 civilian employees. There are nine police beats.

The Billings Fire Department was founded in 1883 as a volunteer fire company named the Billings Fire Brigade. The Yellowstone Hook and Ladder Company was founded in 1886; that company was disbanded in 1888 after the mayor criticized the group for how that handled a fire, leaving the town without a fire department for almost six months. The last volunteer fire company, Maverick Hose Company, served as the city&#x27;s fire department until 1918. The modern fire department has seven stations, employs 114 people, and received a class three rating by ISO.

<text>Huntley is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yellowstone County, Montana, United States. The population was 411 at the 2000 census. Huntley lent its name to the Huntley Project, a federal irrigation project that began delivering water to the arid district in 1907. Today, Huntley is an eastern suburb of Billings and is located east of Shepherd and west of Worden.

==History==

This settlement in arid Crow Indian country was named for S.O. Huntley, a partner in the stagecoach firm of Clark &amp; Huntley. It was located at the head of navigation on the Yellowstone River. The first steamboat, the packet &quot;Josephine&quot;, arrived June 6, 1875, but river trade was infrequent. A U.S. post office was established in March 1878. The 1880 Census found only 37 people living in Huntley.

Surveying for a railroad led to the so-called &quot;Baker Battle&quot; between Sioux Indians and Army engineers in 1872. The Northern Pacific Railroad arrived in 1882, connecting the town to the new city of Billings. Three years later the town called &quot;Huntley Station&quot; had two stores, a hotel, and a blacksmith. German immigrants were prominent among the new settlers, who established Lutheran and German Methodist churches.

In 1905 the United States Bureau of Reclamation began an irrigation project, called the Huntley Project, on lands that had been part of the Crow Indian Reservation until 1904. The town of Huntley was incorporated into the project along with the new railroad towns of Ballantine, Worden, and Pompey&#x27;s Pillar, all founded in 1907.

During the Yellowstone Flood of 1937, the damage to Huntley was more extensive, percentage-wise, than in any other community in the region. Much of the original town of Huntley was destroyed and significant portions of the land it occupied was claimed or compromised by the Yellowstone River. The flood damage included washing away the suspension bridge that allowed adjacent Highway 312 to cross the river. After the flood, the site of the town was relocated from the north side of the river to the higher elevation on the south bank.

Before Laurel became a city or a community, people passed through the site during the gold rush period, when gold was discovered at the Clarks Fork headwaters. They came by team and wagon, and by small steamer vessels up the Yellowstone River. The government was in the process of planning a railroad to the west coast, and had surveying crews out to map the country on the most direct route. Many of the prospectors that went west in search of gold, felt gold might be found in other parts of the state, so some returned to the Yellowstone Valley, and others came from the East to settle here. However, this did not take place until after the Custer Massacre in 1876. It was not until 1877 that the white man felt safe in the Yellowstone Valley, after the power of the Sioux was broken. So it was that while the memory of the Massacre of General Custer and his Command on the Little Big Horn River was still fresh in the minds of settlers of Montana, that a little community was established in the Yellowstone Valley.

The history of Laurel began when settlers began making their homes in the vicinity in 1879. There was a section house built that served as a depot and post office, situated about where Hobo Hill is, or near the center of the present railroad yards east of Laurel. The railroad pushed closer to Laurel from the east, up the Yellowstone Valley during the summer of 1882. Up to this time, there were about 200 people in the community. With the advent of the railroad, the population grew to 368 in 1900, 806 in 1910, and 2,338 in 1920.

Laurel was originally known as the station of Carlton, however by 1883, its name was changed to Laurel, after a local shrub. The post office was established in 1886. Laurel was considered a town in 1906, but it was not until August 1908 that it became incorporated, and two months later, on October 10, 1908, city government was established with the election of a city council and mayor.

<text>Lockwood is a census-designated place (CDP) in Yellowstone County, Montana, United States. It is not an organized city or town. The population was 7,195 at the 2020 census.The population was 7,222 at the 2020 census. Lockwood is a suburb of Billings and is the second largest community in the Billings Metropolitan Statistical Area. Annexation of Lockwood to Billings has been studied; however, the June 2009 Billings City Council Annexation Plan states that the city has no plans to annex Lockwood in the foreseeable future.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , is land and , is water.

==History==
Lockwood bordered the Crow “Mitsiadazi” Reservation, in the 1800s. Cows replacing the buffalo brought an end to the plains Native Americans’ way of life. Lockwood was named after Captain Lockwood, reputed to have many victories fighting Native Americans and to have been a surveyor for the government who camped in the foothills in the late 1800s. In 1907, settlers opened a public road through Lockwood flats of heavy loam to the 2nd crossing of Dry Creek, to the Dry Creek Road traversing to the Reservation. The old Native American supply road is still etched into the side of the hill at the south end of Exxon Road which was later called Peter Hoe Road.

Lockwood Flats was home of the Johnson Ranch. Just to the southeast of the ranch, one can find reminisces of Cavalry camps as they stay in the area for a whole winter surveying the land for the federal government. The area known as Lockwood Flats was also originally the site of a stop called Hirsch, located just between Johnson Lane and old Coulson Road. A community began to develop around it, however, the topographical name Lockwood stuck, and the name Hirsch was eventually forgotten. On June 16, 1965, an F3 tornado touched down near Lockwood. It was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Yellowstone County.

Today, Lockwood has grown to become the largest unincorporated community in the state of Montana and the 16th largest population center in the state. Lockwood is also one of the fastest-growing communities in Montana, with an estimated 58% increase between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. In 2010, Lockwood gained status as a Census Designated Place. Residents and local businesses are working with Yellowstone County and the City of Billings to create a framework for proper infrastructure and zone planning, as well as an eventual incorporation as an official municipality.

On October 24, 2013, Lockwood residents gathered for a large community meeting with 250 attendees to discuss and organize community interest, goals, and direction. Pictures of the historic meeting were recorded of the event and posted on the new [www.lockwoodmontana.com community website]. Groups were organized and champions were chosen for many different issues whether it was for a high school, incorporation, better roads, Billings bypass, community garden, community festival, water &amp; sewer, lighting, sidewalks, and businesses. A celebration was held one year from the historic gathering to celebrate the progress that had been made.

<text>Hastings is a city in and the county seat of Adams County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 25,152 at the 2020 census, making it the 8th most populous city in Nebraska.

Edwin Perkins invented Kool-Aid in Hastings in 1927; the town celebrates the invention with the Kool-Aid Days festival every August.

During World War II, Hastings operated the largest Naval Ammunition Depot in the United States, and for this reason was awarded the distinction of American World War II Heritage City by the National Park Service in 2023.

==History==
===Settlement===
Hastings was founded in 1872 at the intersection of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad and the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad. It was named for Colonel D. T. Hastings of the St. Joseph and Grand Island Railroad, who was instrumental in building the railroad through Adams County. The area was previously open plain: the Donner party passed through on its way to California in 1846 and a pioneer cemetery marker in Hastings bears an inscription taken from Tamsen Donner&#x27;s journal: &quot;The country between the Blue and the Platte is beautiful beyond compare. Never have I seen so varied a country so suitable to cultivation.&quot; In the 1870s, railroads lured European immigrants to the new state of Nebraska with advertisements. Hastings&#x27; first settlers were English, from Liverpool, and were quickly joined by other English, Irish, Germans, Danes, and Germans from Russia.

Between 1872 and 1880, when the population had grown to 2,800, Hastings was a boomtown. Settlers first built sod houses, dugouts, and shanties, then houses and stores. The city was incorporated in April 1874, and in September 1878, after a five-year county seat war, the county seat was transferred to Hastings from Juniata. However, a fire in 1879 destroyed 33 buildings downtown. The city was rebuilt between 1880 and 1890 in fireproof materials and in a more planned fashion, with characteristically ornate Victorian buildings, many designed by Charles C. Rittenhouse, the first practicing architect in Adams County and also mayor for ten years. Thanks to the railroads, the city enjoyed great prosperity during the Gilded Age. The population grew to 13,500. This period of expansion ended with the drought and agricultural depression of the 1890s; the town&#x27;s population fell to 7,000 and would not reach 15,000 until 1930.

African Americans have lived in Hastings since the 1860s. In 1876, Horace G. Newsom started the first Black-owned newspaper in Nebraska.

===20th Century===
Hastings saw renewed growth from 1900 to 1930, which is reflected by buildings in the Craftsman, Prairie, Colonial Revival, and American Foursquare styles. The leading Arts and Crafts architect was Claude W. Way. Hastings had four brickyards and in 1911 was producing more bricks than any other city in Nebraska, and all the paving bricks. During this period, the city also became known as the cigar-making capital of Nebraska. The largest cigar factory, the Kipp Cigar Company, was by 1921 hand-rolling one-fifth of all cigars produced in Nebraska; in 1925 it produced half, a total of 10 million. Cigars lost their popularity to cigarettes between the two World Wars, and in the 1930s the Great Depression again brought the town&#x27;s expansion to a halt.

In 1942, the Naval Ammunition Depot (NAD) was constructed, initiating explosive growth: Hastings&#x27; population grew from 15,000 to 23,000 in under a year and there was a critical shortage of housing, which prompted both alteration of existing housing stock and rapid construction of new neighborhoods. Once World War II ended, staff was reduced at the ammunition depot, bringing Hastings&#x27; last growth period to an end in 1950, and the depot eventually closed. The NAD also significantly increased the city&#x27;s African American population, which went from 70 Black residents in 1940 to more than 1,000 by 1943.

===Kool-Aid===
Kool-Aid was invented by Edwin Perkins in Hastings. All of his experiments took place in his mother&#x27;s kitchen. Its predecessor was a liquid concentrate called Fruit Smack. To reduce shipping costs, in 1927, Perkins discovered a way to remove the liquid from Fruit Smack, leaving only a powder; this powder was named Kool-Aid. Perkins moved his production to Chicago in 1931 and Kool-Aid was sold to General Foods in 1953. Hastings still celebrates a yearly summer festival called Kool-Aid Days on the second weekend in August in honor of their city&#x27;s claim to fame. Kool-Aid is known as Nebraska&#x27;s official soft drink.

===21st century===
Today, Heartwell Park and Central Hastings, two of the oldest neighborhoods, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Hastings Symphony Orchestra performs in the Chautauqua Pavilion, built in 1907 and on the National Register of Historic Places, while the Hastings Community Theatre performs in the auditorium of the former Spencer Park School, built during the housing shortage of the 1940s. The city has adapted several of its historic buildings to new uses. Central Community College is housed in buildings of the former Naval Ammunition Depot. St. Michael&#x27;s Elementary School (formerly the Lincoln Elementary School building), built in 1912, is now the police headquarters. The Clarke Hotel, built in 1914 and also on the National Register of Historic Places, is now the Kensington, a home for senior citizens. Spencer Park, an 840-unit &quot;village&quot; built to house workers in the 1940s, is now Good Samaritan Retirement Village.

In 2000, there were 200 African Americans living in Adams County, with almost all living in Hastings. According to the U.S. Census, in 2022 African Americans comprise .6% of the city&#x27;s population.

==Transportation==
Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service at station in Hastings, operating its California Zephyr daily in each direction between Chicago and Emeryville, California, across the bay from San Francisco. Hastings is served by major highways, including east-west U.S. Highways 6 and 34, and north-south U.S. Highway 281. Burlington Avenue is the main street running from south to north in Hastings; northward it leads to U.S. 281. Hastings is approximately south of Interstate 80.

Hastings Municipal Airport, owned and operated by the City of Hastings, serves the city.

==Education==
The school district is the Hastings Public Schools.

Hastings has several elementary schools. The largest public elementary is Alcott. Others include Hawthorne, Watson, and Lincoln. Zion Classical Academy serves students in grades Preschool–8. There was a new middle school that opened in the fall of 2008. The high schools are Hastings High School (public) Athletics Class B and St. Cecilia&#x27;s (Catholic) Athletics class C–2.

Just outside town is Adams Central Junior-Senior High School (public rural) Athletics Class C.

Hastings College is a private liberal arts college, affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA), and founded in 1882. Central Community College, a two-year technical college, began serving students in 1966, and it occupies the site of the old Naval Ammunition Depot.

==Fisher Fountain==
The Jacob Fisher Rainbow Fountain in Highland Park shoots continuously changing arrays of water jets (reaching heights of 67 feet) while green, yellow, orange, red, magenta, and blue lights illuminate the water in varying patterns.

Fisher Fountain was originally a temporary exhibit at the 1932 Adams County Fair, called the Electric Fountain. It was invented by Edward R. Howard and became a symbol of hope during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl. Because of its popularity, it was moved to the park and made permanent. A competition among schoolchildren to rename it resulted in two winning names that were combined: Rainbow Fountain, and Fisher Fountain after Mayor Jacob Fisher. According to Spilinek, it was set up on the grounds of Hastings Utilities.

Fisher Fountain was renovated in 1982 but was then dynamited by vandals in 1984. Its destruction aroused a strong community response. $63,000 was raised to rebuild it, and it was rededicated on Mother&#x27;s Day in 1985.

==Hastings Museum==
The Hastings Museum of Natural and Cultural History is in an art deco building funded by $75,000 from the Works Progress Administration and completed in 1939. Albert Brooking, who founded the museum in 1926 and provided it with many exhibits, including Indian relics, fossils, and the largest private collection of mounted birds in the US, was buried in the basement in 1946. The museum currently houses the Lied Super Screen Theatre, McDonald Planetarium, and local and regional exhibits including the largest diorama of whooping and sandhill cranes in the world. The Adams County Historical Society is located within the museum.

==Naval Ammunition Depot==

The Naval Ammunition Depot, constructed on southeast of Hastings and in operation from 1942 to 1946, was the largest United States World War II naval munitions plant, encompassing over 2,200 structures valued at $71 million. Hastings was chosen as the location for the plant because of its central location. In 1945 it employed 6,692 civilians in addition to 125 officers and 1,800 enlistees.

The plant was reactivated in the Korean War but decommissioned between 1958 and 1966, and the site now houses a US Department of Agriculture research station, training facilities for the National Guard and Reserves, an industrial park, Central Community College, and a golf course.

==Parks and recreation==

<doc id="123667" wikidata="Q2653589" url="?curid=123667" title="Juniata, Nebraska">
<text>Juniata is a village in Adams County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 744 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Hastings, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Juniata was named by the Burlington Railroad for a river in Pennsylvania and is the oldest town in Adams County. It was platted, organized, and became the county seat in late 1871, the first school district in the county was established there, and the first newspaper in the county, the &quot;Adams County Gazette&quot;, was published there. During the 1870s the Commercial Hotel, south of the railroad depot, was one of the largest in Nebraska west of Lincoln. It was demolished in 1879. On April 12, 1872, the county commissioners declined a request from the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad for $75,000 in bonds to build 25 miles of track, reasoning that the line would be built anyway and would logically cross the Burlington line at Juniata. Instead the railroad laid its tracks seven miles east and set up the new town of Hastings, which in September 1878 won a five-year Great County Seat War and became the county seat. Juniata continued to grow and now has more residents than in the 1880s. However, it has suffered a number of disastrous fires, the last in 1961, and in 1960 a tornado destroyed the 2-story town pump with bandstand that had been built in 1904 at the intersection of Juniata Avenue and Tenth Street. Because of its proximity to Hastings, Juniata is today a commuter suburb.
