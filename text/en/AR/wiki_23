<text>Marshall is a city and the county seat of Calhoun County, Michigan. The population was 6,822 at the 2020 census.

Marshall is best known for its cross-section of 19th- and early 20th-century architecture and as the future home of Ford Motor Company&#x27;s BlueOval Battery Park. It has been referred to by the keeper of the National Register of Historic Places as a &quot;virtual textbook of 19th-Century American architecture.&quot; Its historic center is the Marshall Historic District, one of the nation&#x27;s largest architecturally significant National Historic Landmark Districts. The Landmark has over 850 buildings, including the Honolulu House.

== History ==


The town was founded by Sidney Ketchum (1797–1862) in 1830, a land surveyor born in Clinton County, New York, in conjunction with his brother, George Ketchum (1794-1853). The Ketchum brothers explored central lower Michigan in 1830, and in late 1830, Sidney Ketchum obtained government grants for the land on which most of Marshall now stands. The early settlers named the community in honor of Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall from Virginia—whom they greatly admired. This occurred five years before Marshall&#x27;s death and thus was the first of dozens of communities and counties named for him. The village of Marshall was incorporated March 28, 1836.

Marshall was thought to be the frontrunner for state capital, so much so that a Governor&#x27;s Mansion was built. However, the town lost, along with Lyons, Michigan, by a Yea/Nay vote count of 29-32 against Lansing&#x27;s 35-27 (11 vote difference). In the years thereafter, Marshall became known for its patent medicine industry until the Pure Drug Act of 1906. Marshall was involved in the Underground Railroad. When escaped slave Adam Crosswhite fled Kentucky and settled in Marshall with his wife and three children, the people of the town hid him from the posse sent to retrieve him. Those involved were tried in Federal Court and found guilty of denying a man his rightful property. This case and others like it caused the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 to be pushed through Congress.

=== Stand against slavery ===
In 1843, Adam Crosswhite, his wife Sarah and their four children ran away from Francis Giltner&#x27;s plantation in Hunter&#x27;s Bottom, Carroll County, Kentucky because the Crosswhites learned that one of their four children was to be sold. The Crosswhites made the tough journey north through Indiana along the Underground Railroad, beginning in Madison, Indiana. They finally settled in Marshall, where they were accepted, and Adam worked and built a cabin.

In response to increasing numbers of runaway slaves, a coalition of slave owners in the north central counties and the Bluegrass region of Kentucky organized to recover the runaways. In January 1846, Francis Giltner&#x27;s son David Giltner and three others went to Marshall to capture the Crosswhite family.

On the morning of January 26, 1847, as the slave catchers and a local deputy sheriff were pounding on Adam&#x27;s door, his neighbors heard the noise and came running. The cry of &quot;slave catchers!&quot; was yelled through the streets of Marshall. Soon, over 100 people surrounded the Crosswhite home.

Threats were shouted back and forth. One of the slave catchers began to demand that people in the crowd give him their names. They were proud to tell him and even told him the correct spelling. Each name was written down in a little book. Finally, the deputy sheriff, swayed by the crowd&#x27;s opinion, decided he should arrest the men from Kentucky instead. Marshall townspeople hid the Crosswhites in the attic of George Ingersoll&#x27;s mill. By the time the slave catchers could post bond and get out of jail, Isaac Jacobs, the hostler at the Marshall House, had hired a covered wagon and driven the Crosswhites to Jackson where they boarded a train to Detroit and then crossed over into Canada.

The Giltners sued some of the people from Marshall for damages in what is known in federal records as the &quot;Giltner v. Gorham case&quot;. It was tried in the federal court in Detroit. The &quot;Giltner v Gorham case&quot; resulted in two trials in federal court in Detroit, the first trial ending in a hung jury. At the conclusion of the second trial, the sole remaining defendant in the case, local banker Charles T. Gorham, was ordered to pay the value of the slaves plus court costs. To curry political favor, Detroit entrepreneur Zachariah Chandler supposedly stepped in to pay these costs on Gorham&#x27;s behalf.

Because of the Crosswhite Affair and many others like it, Sen. Henry Clay from Kentucky pushed a new law through Congress in 1850 known as the Fugitive Slave Law, which made it very risky for anyone to help an escaped slave.

Two Marshall citizens Rev. John D. Pierce and lawyer Isaac E. Crary, innovated the Michigan school system and established it as part of the state constitution. Their method and format were later adopted by all the states in the old Northwest Territory and became the foundation for the Morrill Land-Grant Act in 1862, which established schools like Michigan State University all over the country. Pierce became the country&#x27;s first state superintendent of public instruction and Crary Michigan&#x27;s first member of the U.S. House.

=== Railroad Significance ===
The first railroad labor union in the U.S., The Brotherhood of the Footboard (later renamed the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen), was formed in Marshall in 1863. Marshall was one of the only stops between Chicago and Detroit and became known as the Chicken Pie city because the only thing one could get to eat in the time it took to cool and switch engines was a chicken pie. A replica of the city&#x27;s roundhouse can be seen at the Greenfield Village outdoor living history museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

=== Enbridge Oil Spill ===
In July 2010, an oil pipeline, owned by Enbridge Energy, ruptured, spilling over 850,000 gallons of crude oil into Talmadge Creek and into the Kalamazoo River. The event received national attention as it was, at that time, the largest oil spill in the inside the United States. The event was known as the Kalamazoo River Oil Spill.

In 2012, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board stated the Enbridge oil spill in the Kalamazoo River near Marshall was the costliest onshore cleanup in U.S. history.

=== Marshall Industrial Development - Ford ===
In 1968, a large tract of land in Marshall Township, approximately 800 acres, was rezoned to D-2 Park Industrial. The rezoning was sought by Flint industrial real estate developer Robert Gerholz. Gerholtz, a former president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, chose the property because of 4 advantages: 1) proximity to the I-94 &amp; I-69 interchange, 2) access to the railroad, 3) access to hard surface road open to industrial truck travel year-round, and 4) proximity to the Kalamazoo River. Over 140 people turned out for rezoning hearing. It was pointed out at the hearing that the 800 acres fully developed with industry could furnish a 100-million-dollar tax base which was about 3 times the tax base was at that time. Among the people at the hearing were representatives from Marshall City Schools, city and county officials, county road commission, Marshall businesses, and manufacturing plants including Consumers Power Company.

In the years after the rezoning there was regular interest in developing the parcel for a large industrial development. In January 1997 the Gerholtz property was recognized by the Marshall Chamber of Commerce as having &quot;statewide and national attention as one of the best locations in Michigan for large scale industrial development.&quot; Volkswagen AG expressed interest in developing a manufacturing plant on the Gerholtz property in 2008. Accordingly, the Marshall City attorney obtained several options for property surrounding the larger parcel as would be needed for the preliminary site plannings as the Gerholtz property alone was not large enough. A lack of short-term site readiness for construction caused Volkswagen to shift attention to other potential development.

In late 2021 the State of Michigan pushed for the creation of a 100-million-dollar fund for industrial development on large tracts of land after Tennessee and Kentucky landed $11.4 billion in investments from the Ford Motor Company and a battery manufacturer. The site was the subject of planning, and it was anticipated that these funds would be used to develop an industrial master plan and traffic impact studies.

In September 2022, the Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance (MAEDA) and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation began promoting the &quot;Marshall Megasite&quot; to industrial manufacturers but did not disclose their plan to the general public. Notices were not sent to Marshall Township residents immediately adjacent to on in close proximity to the project. At the time the proposed development area encompassed up to 1,600 acres of rural land (owned by separate landowners and just under 800 acres of which had previously been zoned D-2 Park Industrial) located in Marshall Township just outside Marshall&#x27;s city limits. The move was controversial as the land was not yet zoned for heavy industry with the majority, over 1000 acres was zoned agricultural.

Marshall Township Residents were informed that a large industrial project was to take place in their community via the announcement of PA 425 Land Transfers to take place in January 2023. There was vocal public opposition to the land transfers, which would take 1,900 acres off of the Marshall Township Tax rolls and put them on the City of Marshall Tax rolls of which a percentage would go back to Marshall Township per the Master PA 425. The transfer enabled the megasite to have access to city utilities such as water and electricity. The Marshall Township Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 for the PA 425 land transfers. The Marshall City Council voted for the transfer as well, although there was significant public opposition to the project.In February 2023, Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Ford Motor Company announced the Marshall Megasite would become the site of Ford BlueOval Battery Park. The zoning changes on the property to allow for heavy industry were not made until May 1, 2023 by the Marshall City Council. Residents filed a petition for referendum on the zoning and their petition was rejected by the Marshall City Clerk and the Marshall City Council Members. A lawsuit was filed against the City by the ballot committee named &quot;Committee for Marshall-Not the Megasite&quot; The lawsuit was dismissed by the Circuit Court in early January 2024. The Committee for Marshall-Not the Megasite have filed an appeal. This committee was countersued by a committee with ties to Governor Whitmer&#x27;s campaign committee.

Others remained in the area, with many African-Americans and people of mixed African-American and Sapponi and Pumenkey ancestry settling in Cass County.

<text>Marcellus is a village in Cass County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,074 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Marcellus Township. It is part of the South Bend–Mishawaka, IN-MI, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The first settler in the Marcellus area was John Bair, who came in October 1832. He was followed almost a year later by Daniel Driskel, in 1833. In 1835, 11 other families settled in Marcellus, and by 1836, 28 families had settled there.

At the time of the organization of the township the citizens wanted to call it Cambria; however, since there was already a township by that name in Michigan, their Representative at that time, Judge Littlejohn of Allegan, proposed they name it after Roman Emperor Flavius Marcellus. As a result, on June 16, 1843, the township was officially named Marcellus. Elections were held on the same night and Daniel G. Rouse was elected Township Supervisor, Guerdor R. Beebee was elected Treasurer, and Ephraim Huyatt was elected Clerk.

In the winter of 1870–71 the Peninsular Railroad came through Marcellus, infusing life into the small township. The depot was originally on the east side of town; however, because the business district was far from the depot, the depot was moved in 1898. After this move, business began rapidly expanding and an addition was added to the station to meet the increased traffic demands. By 1911, ten passenger trains stopped at the depot every day.

Marcellus became an official village in 1879, with over 500 residents. Three years later it had grown and included 2 churches, 3 dry goods stores, 3 groceries, 3 millinery shops, 2 drug stores, 2 meat markets, 2 hotels, 2 tin shops, a bank, 2 stave factories, 2 harness shops, a hardware store, a furniture store, a restaurant, a printing business, a tailor shop, a cooper shop, a steam saw mill, a sash and blind manufacturer, 4 doctors, 2 lawyers, 2 justices of the peace, and a newspaper.

During its height, Marcellus was also home to two theaters, a bowling alley, and a pool hall. Each year it hosts the National Bluegill Frolic, and previously hosted a parade, fishing tournament, and beauty pageant which attracted thousands each year.

<text>Boyne City () is a city in Charlevoix County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,816 at the 2020 census, making it the largest city in Charlevoix County. Boyne City is located at the eastern end of Lake Charlevoix, Michigan&#x27;s third largest inland lake. The city is also the site of the mouth of the Boyne River, named for the River Boyne in Leinster, Ireland.

==History==
The area was first settled as early as 1856 by the families of John Dixon and John Miller in 1856, which was part of Emmet County until Charlevoix County was organized in 1869. Miller first named the settlement Boyne, as it was near the already-named Boyne River, which derived its name from a river in Ireland. A post office named Boyne opened on September 29, 1869, with Miller serving as the first postmaster. Others moved to the area with the opening of the Pine Lake House by A. J. Hall in 1879. The community incorporated as a village in 1885 and was renamed Boyne City in 1904. It incorporated as a city in 1907.

Boyne City was home to the Buelah Home, which was built by Herman Swift in 1902. It served as a housing facility for delinquent boys. By 1910, the Buelah Home housed approximately 200 boys, who were also reviled by the community for committing numerous crimes and causing mischief. Soon after, Swift was accused of molesting numerous boys under his care, and criminal charges were filed. It became a cause célèbre in Northern Michigan, and it made headlines throughout the country. Many boys who accused Swift of the charges dropped out of the lawsuit to avoid public scrutiny. The case dragged on for three years before eventually making its way to the Michigan Supreme Court under chief justice Joseph H. Steere. Swift was acquitted, but it led to the Buelah Home being closed in 1912 and demolished in 1920.

The city contains three listings on the National Register of Historic Places. The downtown area along Lake Street and Water Street has been included into the Boyne City Central Historic District. The municipal Boyne City Water Works Building was constructed in 1910 when the city was experiencing a tremendous growth in population, and the building continues to serve its purpose as a city water system booster station. The Chicago and West Michigan Railroad Charlevoix Station was built in 1892 as a station along the Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad, and it now serves as a museum and rental hall.

<text>Charlevoix ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the county seat of Charlevoix County. Part of Northern Michigan, Charlevoix is located on an isthmus between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, bisected by the short Pine River. Charlevoix serves as the main access point for Beaver Island, the largest island in Lake Michigan, which can be accessed by Island Airways or carferry. The population of Charlevoix was 2,348 at the 2020 census. Charlevoix is mostly surrounded by Charlevoix Township, but the two are administered autonomously.

==History==

Charlevoix is named after Fr. Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix, a French explorer who traveled the Great Lakes and was said to have stayed the night on Fisherman&#x27;s Island during a harsh storm. During this time, Native Americans were thought to have lived in the Pine River valley. The Odawa and Ojibwe lived throughout northern Michigan prior to European colonization.

===Settlement (1850s and 1860s) ===

European-American settlement of Charlevoix was initially by fishermen, who were there by 1852. Soon after its formation in the 1850s, the residents of Charlevoix entered into a short-lived conflict with Jesse Strang, leader and namesake of the Strangite Mormons, and then self-proclaimed &#x27;king&#x27; of Beaver Island. Relations between Charlevoix residents and the Strangites were often tense. In 1853, a gunfight broke out between the two groups as the townspeople refused to hand over a man who was called for jury duty on the island, an event known locally as The Battle of Pine River. Strang was assassinated on June 20, 1856.

The Homestead Act of 1862 brought many Civil War veterans and speculators to Northern Michigan. It sold 160-acre tracts of land for $1.25 an acre. 

In 1864, settlers built a large dock at the mouth of the Pine River on Lake Michigan. Boats there were exposed to the harsh vicissitudes of Great Lakes weather, so local entrepreneurs sought to connect Lake Michigan to an inland harbor at Round Lake. The Pine River channel was dredged in 1869, connecting Lake Michigan to Lake Charlevoix.

In 1866, early settler John S. Dixon completed plats of the entire town (then called &quot;Pine River&quot;), showing that he owned most of the land. By 1867, Charlevoix had its first boarding house, the Fountain City House Charlevoix became the county seat in 1869 when Charlevoix County was formed.

===Commercial and cultural transformation (1869–1880s) === 
In 1869, the Charlevoix Sentinel was founded, which became a major newspaper of record for the area for the next 60 years.

Prior to 1869, Lake Charlevoix (then known as Pine Lake) was two feet higher than Round Lake, which was 2 feet higher than Lake Michigan. In order to aid lumber and boat traffic, city leaders pooled resources to cut a channel between Lake Charlevoix to Round Lake, and to dredge the Pine River for navigation between Round Lake and Lake Michigan. When this was completed in 1869, lake levels dropped, and navigation between Lake Charlevoix and Lake Michigan was established. This had profound commercial implications for the area.

Another transformative event came in November 1873 when rail operations arrived in &quot;Bear Creek&quot; (now known as Petoskey), 16 miles north. Passengers and goods passed through Petoskey and made their way to Charlevoix via boat or stagecoach. During the 1870s, Presbyterian evangelist Rev. George W. Wood Jr. sold bibles to homesteading settlers throughout Charlevoix and Emmet Counties.

Between 1868 and 1884, the Army Corps of Engineers used dredging and revetment to increase Pine River channel width from 75 feet to over 100 feet, and expanded the channel depth from under 6 feet to a depth of 12 feet. In 1876, Charlevoix was declared a port of entry and became one of the busiest ports on the Great Lakes. Lumber mills proliferated as the forests along Lake Charlevoix could finally be harvested.

In 1876, John Nichols consolidated Charlevoix lumber operations into the Charlevoix Lumber Company, and it became a Charlevoix institution for decades. At its height in the late 1800s, the company annually shipped out more than 40 million board feet of lumber before it stripped much of the peninsula. For many years Charlevoix was a fueling stop for the wood-powered steamships on Lake Michigan. Charlevoix incorporated as a village in 1879.

In June 1883, Charles J. Strang, the son of Mormon King James J. Strang started the Charlevoix Journal, which would be renamed the Charlevoix Courier in 1894. Dr. Levi Lewis and his wife Edith built the 800-seat &quot;Lewis Grand Opera House&quot; along the Pine River in 1883 in order to bring more culture to the backwater pioneer town.

In October 1884, East Jordan to be the county seat, followed by Boyne City becoming the county seat in 1886. Charlevoix became the county seat again in 1894. The Argo Milling Company was built in 1886 along the Pine River. [ By 1914, many small businesses were established along Bridge Street. 

===Early resort era (1880s–1918)===
In 1880, several members of the First Congregational Church of Chicago formed a Chicago Summer Resort association, now known as the &quot;Chicago Club.&quot; Early citizens contributed to the founding of such early institutions as the Lewis Grand Opera House (1883) and Methodist (1878) and Congregational (1885) churches.

In 1892, the first rail traffic to Charlevoix arrived as the Chicago and West Michigan Railway extended rail service from Traverse City to Bay View. (This is not related to the 1901 Detroit and Charlevoix Railroad line to East Jordan). Rail lines opened up formerly remote tracts of inland land and lakeshore to commercial, industrial, resort, and other real estate development, as follows:

* The Detroit-based D.M. Ferry Seed Company expanded operations in northern Michigan, developing the land along Lake Charlevoix in 1892. It built a 200&#x27; dock and warehouse complex by 1905. Ferry&#x27;s Charlevoix operations continued until 1927.
* In 1899, the Federal Revenue Cutter Service came to Charlevoix and began tending buoys on the north side of the Round lake train bridge. This site would later become known as the Coast Guard moorings.
* By 1901, industrialist James M. Felts of Rushville, Indiana had purchased thousands of acres between Mount McSauba and Big Rock point and began construction of a massive sugar beet factory to be called the Charlevoix Sugar Company. The National Construction Company of Detroit built the factory between 1902 and 1903 at the point where Stover Creek emptied into Pine Lake. The factory was not profitable, and by 1911 the factory had closed and the machinery was removed to Ohio. The building, made almost entirely of concrete, slowly decayed until it was demolished in 1964 to make room for the Irish boat shop.
* In 1909, Chicago real estate developer and Chicago Club of Charlevoix member Edward Carson Waller purchased 2000-acres north of the Pere Marquette rail line including the former Felts tract. He replanted the land with pine trees, and commissioned architect Frank Lloyd Wright to create a bathing pavilion on the site. The pavilion burned down in 1922 or 1923.
* The rail also brought tourist traffic during the summer. It was not long before the city became known as a resort destination. With three summer associations (the Belvedere Club, Sequanota Club, and the Chicago Club); a number of luxurious summer hotels, including The Inn and The Beach; and rail service at two train depots on the Pere Marquette Railway line (one depot for the Belvedere Club on the south side of Round Lake and one on the north side near the Chicago Club); Charlevoix became known as one of the nation&#x27;s finest summer communities.
* In 1913, the Pine Point development (near Oyster Bay) opened on Pine Lake, making it one of the earliest neighborhood subdivisions in the Charlevoix area.

Charlevoix was also a popular destination for many lake passenger liners, including the &quot;Manitou&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot;, &quot;North American&quot;, &quot;South American&quot;, &quot;Milwaukee Clipper,&quot; &quot;Illinois&quot;, and others. By 1907, the Gazetteer published by R.L. Polk &amp; Co. listed Charlevoix as a port of call for several Michigan steamboat lines including:
* the Anchor Line (Erie and Western Transportation Company from Buffalo, Erie, Cleveland, and Detroit to the summer resorts, Mackinac Island, Sault Ste. Marie, Marquette, Houghton and Hancock, Duluth, St. Paul, Minneapolis etc. connecting at Mackinaw Island with steamer lines to and from Milwaukee and Chicago, Petoskey, Charlevoix, Frankfort, Bay View, and Green Bay Ports.)
* Boyne City and Charlevoix Line (daily)
* East Jordan and Charlevoix Steamboat Line
* Manitou Steamship Company (Between Chicago, Frankfort, Charlevoix, Petoskey, Roaring Brook, Wequetonsing, Harbor Springs, Bay View, and Mackinaw)
* Northern Michigan Transportation Company (every Wednesday and Saturday between Chicago and Ludington, Manistee, Frankfort, Glen Haven, Glen Arbor, Northport, Suttons Bay, Traverse City, Old Mission, Charlevoix, Petoskey, Harbor Springs, Bay View, St. James, St. Ignace, Mackinac Island, and Cheboygan)
* Traverse Bay Transportation Company (daily between Traverse City, Northport, Charlevoix, and intermediate points)

===Interwar era (1919–1945)===
Northern Michigan continued to be a resort destination after World War I.

Beginning in 1918 real estate agent, regional promoter, and self-taught architect Earl Young began to design and build his signature &quot;mushroom houses&quot; and other buildings out of locally harvested boulders.

In 1925, members of the Charlevoix Summer Resort Association decided their existing social club needed a golf course. The members called on Scotsman William Watson, who was working across town as head pro of the Chicago Club. Watson&#x27;s resume included working on such layouts like Interlachen Country Club in Minneapolis, Harding Park Golf Club, and the Olympic Club in San Francisco. At Belvedere he used five teams of horses and 150 men to build 18 holes through a pair of valleys dissected by Marion Center Rd. just south of town. Opened in 1927, the course soon became a respected tournament venue.

In 1918, Albert Loeb, an executive from the Sears corporation in Chicago, built an experimental farm on the southern outskirts of Charlevoix. Known as Loeb Farms, the farm raised prizewinning cattle sold through the Sears Catalog. In its heyday it was the primary employer in Charlevoix County. Loeb&#x27;s son became involved in an infamous murder trial (the Leopold and Loeb trial). During the trial, Scopes trial lawyer Clarence Darrow arrived at the Charlevoix train station to visit the Loeb family at Loeb Farms. Albert Loeb died in 1924 and the farm closed in 1927 after a three-year agricultural recession.

In 1926. Pine Lake was renamed Lake Charlevoix.

Between 1927 and 1948, former Michigan football player Lewis Reimann founded Camp Charlevoix as a recreational camp for at-risk boys. first in Ironton, Michigan and then in 1928 at a permanent 170-acre site on the shores of Lake Charlevoix. Reimann operated Camp Charlevoix for more than 20 years. After an expansion in 1937, Reimann sold Camp Charlevoix in 1948. Camp Charlevoix continued operations under Kenneth W. Smith until at least 1960.

During Prohibition, Charlevoix became a popular place for gang members from the Chicago area. The Colonial Club, a restaurant and gambling joint on the city&#x27;s north side became known as a popular place for the Midwest&#x27;s most powerful and influential. John Koch, the club&#x27;s owner, kept automobile license number &quot;2&quot;, only second to the governor – a telling sign of his influence. The converted lumber barge &quot;Keuka&quot; served as a blind pig and speakeasy and sailed nightly between Boyne City and Charlevoix, hosting its guests in relative comfort. A murder aboard the ship and the pressure of US Treasury Department surveillance, however, forced the owner to scuttle the vessel in Lake Charlevoix.

In 1930, the first Charlevoix Venetian Festival started as a candle-lit boat parade. (It has continued to be held annually and grown in length and in the types of entertainment offered.)

In the early 1930s photographer and historian Bob Miles began a 42-year career documenting the city of Charlevoix and surrounding areas.

On March 9, 1935, The Petoskey Kiwanis Club sponsored a charter meeting of the Charlevloix Kiwanis Club. In 1939, the Charlevoix Kiwanis Club created Boy Scout Troop 11. Troop 11 is the second oldest Boy Scout troop in Northern Michigan.

Several bridges had been built to cross the Pine River. A drawbridge was planned to be built in 1940, but due to Pearl Harbor, the completion of the current Charlevoix drawbridge bridge was delayed until 1947.

===Post WWII era (1945–1980)===

Charlevoix suffered economically during the decades after World War II, due to industrial restructuring and changes in fashion, as people used automobiles and airplanes to travel to new tourist destinations. The manufacturing base was displaced with jobs moved elsewhere, the train lines to the city ceased operating, and the larger tourist hotels closed due to competition from other locations. Many empty buildings were left downtown. Several large corporations, such as the nuclear power plant and the cement plant, set up operations in the early 1960s and spurred economic development in the area.

In the 1960s, the lifesaving station was relocated from along the channel to the east part of Round Lake.

November 18, 1958, Charlevoix City Hall served as a makeshift morgue for the bodies of crewmen of the SS &quot;Carl D. Bradley&quot; after the lake freighter foundered in Lake Michigan during a severe storm. The USCGC &quot;Sundew&quot;, stationed at Charlevoix, was one of the first vessels to arrive at the search area and played a pivotal role in that night&#x27;s rescue of the two surviving crewmen.

Charlevoix was home to Michigan&#x27;s first nuclear power plant, Big Rock Point, which operated from 1962 to 1997.

On January 7, 1971, an unarmed USAF B-52C-45-BO, 54-2666, of the 9th BW, Westover AFB, Massachusetts, crashed into Lake Michigan near Charlevoix during a practice bomb run, exploding on impact. Only a small amount of wreckage, two life vests, and some spilled fuel were found in Little Traverse Bay. The bomber went down six nautical miles from the Bay Shore Air Force Radar Site and close to the Big Rock Point Nuclear Plant. Nine crew members were lost.

In the 1960s, the Medusa corporation decided to build their first greenfield cement plant. they build a cement plant in Charlevoix that came on line in 1967. The plant is located south of town off of US 31 near Fisherman&#x27;s Island State Park. In the late 1970s, Crane Company took over Medusa and began consolidating operations. This not only resulted in modernization and investment in the Charlevoix plant, but personnel (and their families) from other Crane cement holdings were transferred into the Charlevoix area in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the late 1990s the cement plant was bought out by Cemex, a transnational company from Mexico. In 2000 Cemex sold the plant to St Marys Cement Group. Until 2013 the cement plant was a frequent port of call for the oldest freighter on the great lakes, &quot;SS St. Marys Challenger&quot;.

In 1965 the Loeb Farms complex that had been fallow since 1927, was turned into a medieval castle tourist attraction by John Van Haver . This venture quickly folded and was bought by the Reibel family in 1969. For the next ~25 years, the Castle Farms complex hosted large rock concerts.
In 1974, Terry and Judy Edger opened WVOY-AM in Charlevoix. WVOY was a 5,000-watt daytime-only station at 1270 kHz on the AM dial. WVOY was one of the first all-contemporary-hit-music radio stations in northern Michigan and featured Bill Vogel (&quot;The Captain,&quot; formerly of Detroit&#x27;s WDRQ), John Yaroch, Rick Durkin, and other major-market-quality talent. Despite WVOY&#x27;s limited signal, the station became extremely popular and gave northern Michigan listeners a taste of the &quot;big city&quot; radio sound.

===Recent history (1980–present)===
In May 1980, former WVOY employee Tim Moore started the WKHQ-FM &quot;The Rhythm of the Northwest&quot; radio station in downtown Charlevoix using TM Programming&#x27;s &quot;Stereo Rock&quot; format. Despite moving its studios to Petoskey in the 1990s, WKHQ is still licensed as being from Charlevoix. The station was mentioned by Casey Kasem several times on American Top 40 radio program in the 1980s.

The 1980s brought many condominium developments in the area.

In 1991, former farmland near Stover Creek along M-66 was developed into &quot;Charlevoix Commons&quot; shopping center, anchored by a K-mart with the Charlevoix Estates mobile home park across the street. Several new businesses established themselves in this area, and the Post office moved from downtown to this site in 1996.

In 1993 600 acres of the undeveloped Waller tract on the north side of town was transformed into an 18-hole golf course and residential development named the Charlevoix Country Club.

After the 1996 murder of JonBenét Ramsey, whose family spent summers in Charlevoix and had won a pageant in the town, Charlevoix became a regular haven for tabloid photographers, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Ramsey family. John Ramsey, JonBenet&#x27;s father and husband of the late Patsy Ramsey, still resides in Charlevoix.

In 1997, Charlevoix made national news when it experienced a fireworks disaster during the Venetian Festival. At least one person died and 17 others were injured, while windows were shattered across downtown.

In 2004 and 2005, Wal-Mart tried to build a 157,400-square-foot superstore on the edge of town (Charlevoix Township) near the intersection of US-31 and Marion Center Road across from the Charlevoix airport. Amid community disagreement, some local businesses and residents formed a group called &quot;This Is Our Town&quot; and successfully resisted the entry of Wal-Mart into their community.

==Transportation==

===Water===

The town is situated between Lake Michigan and the western end of Lake Charlevoix, which drains into Lake Michigan through the short Round Lake/Pine River complex in the heart of downtown Charlevoix. The Charlevoix South Pier Light Station marks the opening of the channel onto Lake Michigan. Charlevoix&#x27;s Round Lake has been called the best natural harbor on Lake Michigan. The only way to get from Lake Michigan to East Jordan, Boyne City and other sites on Lake Charlevoix by boat is via Charlevoix. As a result, much commercial, industrial, and recreational boat traffic passes through Charlevoix.

===U.S. Coast Guard Station===
The town of Charlevoix has a U.S. Coast Guard station located in its vicinity. Station Charlevoix has served the waters of Lake Charlevoix and Lake Michigan for over one hundred years. The station was first sited in 1898 on the south break wall of the Pine River Channel, leading into Lake Michigan. It was officially commissioned as a United States Lifesaving Service Station July 5, 1900. During the early 1960s, the station was relocated to its present-day location along the Pine River Channel&#x27;s Lake Charlevoix end. The area of response for Station Charlevoix runs from Cross Village down to Leland, extending into Lake Michigan through Beaver Island and the North and South Fox Islands, and covers numerous inland lakes and waterways. Spring through late fall the 41&#x27; UTB and the 25&#x27; RB-S are in operation and during the winter months, the 14&#x27; ice skiff is put into operation. There is also a U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla based at the Station. Some USCG Auxiliary surface facilities are occasionally moored at Station Charlevoix.

Freight rail service ended between Charlevoix and Williamsburg, Michigan in 1982 after C&amp;O Railroad abandoned the track. The tracks were removed in 1983. The state of Michigan purchased the track between Charlevoix and Petoskey from the C&amp;O Railroad and contracted Michigan Northern Railway to operate it. This section of track was removed in the 1990s because of a series of washouts and no rail freight customers in Charlevoix. Sections of this rail line now serve as a bicycle trail. The Charlevoix railroad depot has been adapted as a museum of the Charlevoix Historical Society.

<text>East Jordan is a city in Charlevoix County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 2,239 at the 2020 census.

The city is at the end of the south arm of Lake Charlevoix at the mouth of the Jordan River. The corporate headquarters of EJ, an international company formerly known as East Jordan Iron Works, is located in East Jordan. EJ was founded in East Jordan in 1883.

==History==
The area was first settled by Canadian William Empey in 1873. He built the first store here in 1874 at the mouth of the Jordan River at the southernmost point of Lake Charlevoix. He became the first postmaster when the post office opened on May 31, 1878. The community absorbed the nearby village of South Arm and incorporated as the village of East Jordan in 1887. It incorporated as a city in 1911.

East Jordan grew quickly, and by 1890, it boasted a large ironworks company now known as EJ. The city was serviced by two railroads. With these two railroad connections, and the ability to ship cargo up Lake Charlevoix to Lake Michigan, East Jordan quickly grew into a major manufacturing center. To this day, four industrial corporations still operate within the town. In 1899, the Detroit and Charlevoix Railroad built their mainline through the East side of the city, and in 1901, the East Jordan and Southern Railroad began operations on the western end of the city. In 1932, the Detroit and Charlevoix was abandoned, and the East Jordan and Southern closed in 1961 after the East Jordan Iron Works ended shipping by rail.

<text>Cheboygan ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the county seat and largest settlement of Cheboygan County. At the 2020 census, Cheboygan had a population 4,770.

Cheboygan is situated on Lake Huron at the mouth of the Cheboygan River. It is the fourth-largest American city on Lake Huron after Bay City, Port Huron, and Alpena. Cheboygan is part of Northern Michigan, and is the northernmost city in Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula. Directly north of Cheboygan is Bois Blanc Island (part of Mackinac County), which can be accessed via ferry from Cheboygan.

==History==

Cheboygan was originally an Ojibwe settlement. In 1844, Jacob Sammons, a cooper from Fort Mackinac, chose the old native camping ground, known as Shabwegan, as the site for his cabin. He recruited other settlers, and a post office named &quot;Duncan&quot; was established in 1846. It was made the county seat in 1853.

Duncan or Duncan City was given a post office in 1850 as a result of the building of sawmills in this area. Duncan was made the county seat in 1853 and the location of the federal land office in 1855. The county seat shifted to Cheboygan in about 1870. Later Duncan was included within the expanded boundaries of Cheboygan.

The area became known as Cheboygan in 1870. It was incorporated as a village in 1871. Rail maps in 1876 show planned rail service for Cheboygan, but due to various setbacks, rail did not arrive there until 1881. There was a theater built in town in 1877.

Cheboygan was incorporated as a city in 1889.

In approximately 1890, Cheboygan became the home port for ferryboats to nearby Bois Blanc, an island in the Straits of Mackinac. Early in the 20th century, it was home to the pioneering brass era cyclecar maker, Flagler (de:Flagler Cyclecar).

In 1944, Cheboygan became the home port of the former U.S. Coast Guard cutter and icebreaker , serving from 1944 to 2006. Beginning in 2006, the port continued this role as the home dock of the new , a successor cutter.

=== Etymology ===
The name of the city shares the name of the county and probably has its origin from the Cheboygan River, although the precise meaning is no longer known. It may have come from an Ojibwe word &quot;zhaabonigan&quot; meaning &quot;sewing needle&quot;. Alternatively, the origin may have been &quot;Chabwegan,&quot; meaning &quot;a place of ore.&quot;

<text>Wolverine is a village in Cheboygan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 244 at the 2010 census.

The village is mostly located within Nunda Township with a small portion extending west into Wilmot Township. It is located directly west of Interstate 75 about south of the Mackinac Bridge.

==History==
The area was originally settled by Jacob Shook and his family as early as 1874. The community was named &quot;Torrey&quot; when George Richards settled in the area soon after. Venturing to the area was difficult, as the nearest railway line ended in Gaylord about to the south. Richards was a frequent traveler back and forth to Gaylord for mail and supplies, often staying mid-route at Vanderbilt. He requested a closer post office, which was granted under the name Wolverine in late 1880.

The post office was first established on January 3, 1881, and continues to remain in operation. Richards served as the first postmaster. As an early settler of the community, he helped organize and operate the local school district and was also a real estate dealer and lumberman. He was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1903.

In 1881, Wolverine recorded 18 residents. Soon after, the Jackson, Lansing, and Saginaw Railroad Company received a deed and began railway construction at the community of Trowbridge about to the southeast. By 1891, the population of Wolverine increased to about 1,000 residents, who mainly worked for the railway and lumbering industry. The community incorporated as a village in 1903. By 1905, the area population was around 1,800. When the lumber industry declined by the 1930s, the population drastically decreased as many people left Wolverine.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (1.01%) is water.

Wolverine is situated on the Sturgeon River where the west branch joins the main branch at .

Wolverine contains its own post office using the 49799 ZIP Code, which is the highest numeric ZIP Code in the state&#x27;s Lower Peninsula. The Wolverine post office serves a much larger area that includes most of Nunda Township and Wilmot Township, as well as smaller portions of Ellis Township and Mentor Township. The post office also serves a very small portion of Corwith Township in Otsego County to the south, as well as very small portions of Chandler Township in Charlevoix County and Springvale Township in Emmet County to the west.

<text>Drummond Township ( ) is a civil township of Chippewa County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 973 at the 2020 census.

The township encompasses the large Drummond Island and numerous smaller islands. Drummond Island is the seventh-largest lake island in the world. With an area of , it is also the third-largest lake island in Lake Huron, behind Manitoulin and St. Joseph, and the fifth-largest island in the contiguous United States, behind Long Island, Padre Island, Isle Royale and Whidbey Island. M-134 extends from the mainland to run through the western portion of the island, connecting with the mainland via the Drummond Island Ferry, which runs between the island and DeTour Village.

On the east side of Drummond Island, the Canada–United States border passes through the False Detour Channel. On the other side of that channel, the Canadian Cockburn Island separates Drummond from Manitoulin Island.

==Communities==
* Drummond (or Drummond Island) is an unincorporated community on Potagannissing Bay on the northwest side of the island at . It was named after British commander Gordon Drummond, who built a fort here after the War of 1812. He abandoned the fort in 1822 when it was apparent that the island would become American territory. By the 1850s, the area was settled by Mormon missionaries and Native Americans. A post office in Drummond began operating on February 9, 1881. The post office was renamed Drummond Island on July 1, 1953. The Drummond Island 49726 ZIP Code serves the entirety of Drummond Township. 
* Johnswood (also spelled as Johns Wood) is an unincorporated community on the southern coast of the island at . The community was settled around 1905 when the Kreetan Company from Tonawanda, New York took over the area sawmills. It was originally named Scammon&#x27;s Cove after the small bay. A post office began operating under the name Kreetan on September 7, 1905. The post office was renamed Johns Wood when Harold Johnson became postmaster on March 19, 1914. The post office remained in operation until 1927.
* Lincoln is an unincorporated community near the center of Drummond Island at . 
* Maxton is an unincorporated community located at . The community was established by the Cleveland Cedar Company in 1904 as a sawmill settlement along Potagannissing Bay a few miles northeast of Drummond. For the next three decades, several other sawmills began operating here. A post office in Maxton operated from 1904 until 1950. 

==History==

The township and island are named after Gordon Drummond, the first Canadian-born officer to command the military and the civil government of British Canada. As Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Drummond distinguished himself on the Niagara front in the War of 1812 and later became Governor-General and Administrator of Canada. The Ojibwe name for the island is &quot;Bootaagan-minising&quot; (syncope as &quot;Bootaagan-mnising&quot; recorded as &quot;Potagannissing&quot;), meaning &quot;at the Mill Island&quot;.

The history of Drummond Island dates back centuries, but more recent history of the past 200 years relates to the British occupation of the island during and after the War of 1812. The island was the last British outpost on American soil following the Treaty of Ghent (1814). On October 6, 1828, orders were sent out from Quebec that the post would be handed over, and the island was officially occupied by United States on November 14, 1828. Drummond Island was originally recorded by Americans as First Manitoulin Island and Drummond&#x27;s Island.

===Border on the Great Lakes===

British and American negotiators to the 1814 Treaty of Ghent ended the War of 1812 by offering no territorial concessions to either side, but returned to those boundaries set by the Treaty of Paris of 1783. To resolve territorial claims that had precipitated the war, negotiators at Ghent established a process whereby commissioners would survey the boundary to determine the borders envisioned in the original treaty.

Beginning in August 1820, two teams of surveyors, including British explorer and cartographer David Thompson, mapped the area of St. Joseph Island, Drummond Island, and Lesser and Greater Manitou Islands (today Cockburn and Manitoulin islands). Mapping this corner of Lake Huron was a challenge given that little was known about the shores and depths of the channels between the islands. The agent for the United States survey team, Major Joseph Delafield, complained, &quot;No map that I have seen has any truth as it respects the position of Drummond&#x27;s or the other islands about St. Marys. We entered this bay without a pilot, but are told we cannot proceed up river without one.&quot;

Based on the surveys taken in the summers of 1820 and 1821, and guided by the commission&#x27;s two principles that the boundary would not divide islands and that the number of islands would be apportioned equally between the two countries, in November and December 1821, commissioners agreed to grant St. Joseph Island and Cockburn Island to Canada and Drummond Island, which lies between them, to the United States.

==Geography==

According to the US Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 48.23%, is water. The island is dominated by forest, with cliffs on the eastern side, which are part of the Niagara Escarpment.

Most of the island, approximately , is state land owned by the state of Michigan. The island hosts a rare environment known as alvar, a grassy limestone plain found only in a few places worldwide. Drummond Island is the largest island in the Manitoulin Island chain to be part of the United States.

Drummond Township is one of only seven municipalities in the state of Michigan to consist entirely of islands, including Grosse Ile Township, St. James Township, Bois Blanc Township, Mackinac Island, Peaine Township, and Sugar Island Township.

===Climate===
===Major highways===
* is the sole highway serving the island. The Drummond Island Ferry connects M-134 to the island from DeTour Village. West of there, M-134 parallels the shore of Lake Huron, until it meets I-75 near St. Ignace. It is one of three state trunkline highways on islands in Michigan; the others being M-154 on Harsens Island, and M-185 on Mackinac Island.

==Demographics==
In 2020, the township had a population of 973.

<text>Sault Ste. Marie ( &quot;&quot;) is a city in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the county seat of Chippewa County and is the only city within the county. With a population of 13,337 at the 2020 census, it is the second-most populated city in the Upper Peninsula, behind Marquette. It is the primary city of the Sault Ste. Marie, MI Micropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Chippewa County and had a population of 36,785 at the 2020 census. Sault Ste. Marie was settled by mostly French colonists in 1668, making it the oldest city in Michigan. 

Sault Ste. Marie is located along the St. Marys River, which flows from Lake Superior to Lake Huron and forms part of the United States–Canada border. Across the river is the larger city of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario; the two cities are connected by the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge. Between the two cities are the Soo Locks, a set of locks allowing ship travel between Lake Superior and the Lower Great Lakes. 

Sault Ste. Marie is home to Lake Superior State University.

==Etymology==
The city name was derived from the French term for the nearby rapids, which were called &quot;Les Saults de Sainte Marie.&quot; &quot;Sainte Marie&quot; (Saint Mary) was the name of the river and &quot;Saults&quot; referred to the rapids.
(The archaic spelling &quot;Sault&quot; is a relic of the Middle French Period. Latin successively became Old French (), Middle French , and Modern French &quot;,&quot; as in the verb , to jump.)

Whereas the modern means simply &quot;(a) jump&quot;, &quot;sault&quot; in the 17th century was also applied to cataracts, waterfalls and rapids. This resulted in such place names as Grand Falls/Grand-Sault, and Sault-au-Récollet on the Island of Montreal in Canada; and Sault-Saint-Remy and Sault-Brénaz in France. In contemporary French, the word for &quot;rapids&quot; is &quot;rapides&quot;.

 in French means &quot;the Rapids of Saint Mary&quot; (for a more detailed discussion, refer to the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario page). The Saint Mary&#x27;s River runs from Lake Superior to Lake Huron, between what are now the twin border cities on either side.

No hyphens are used in the English spelling, which is otherwise identical to the French, but the pronunciations differ. Anglophones say and Francophones say . In French, the name can be written . On both sides of the border, the towns and the general vicinity are called The Sault (usually pronounced ), or The Soo.
==History==
For centuries, Oc̣eṭi Ṡakowiƞ (Dakota, Lakota, Nakoda), or Sioux, people lived in the area. Around the 1300s, the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) began to move in from the East Coast, gradually pushing the Oc̣eṭi Ṡakowiƞ westward. They called the area Baawitigong (&quot;at the cascading rapids&quot;), after the rapids of St. Marys River. French colonists renamed the region Saulteaux (&quot;rapids&quot; in French). The Oc̣eṭi Ṡakowiƞ came to call the Anishinaabe &quot;Ḣaḣaṭuƞwaƞ&quot;, or &quot;Dwellers of the Falls&quot;.

In 1668, French missionaries Claude Dablon and Jacques Marquette founded a Jesuit mission at this site. Sault Ste. Marie developed as one of oldest European cities in the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains, and the oldest permanent European settlement in Michigan. On June 4, 1671, Simon-François Daumont de Saint-Lusson, a colonial agent, was dispatched from Quebec to the distant tribes, proposing a congress of Indian nations at the Falls of St. Mary between Lake Huron and Lake Superior. Trader Nicolas Perrot helped attract the principal chiefs, and representatives of 14 Indigenous nations were invited for the elaborate ceremony. The French officials proclaimed France&#x27;s appropriation of the immense territory surrounding Lake Superior in the name of King Louis XIV.

In the 18th century, the settlement became an important center of the fur trade, when it was a post for the British-owned North West Company, based in Montreal. The fur trader John Johnston, a Scots-Irish immigrant from Belfast, was considered the first European settler in 1790. He married a high-ranking Ojibwe woman named Ozhaguscodaywayquay, the daughter of a prominent chief, Waubojeeg. She also became known as Susan Johnston. Their marriage was one of many alliances in the northern areas between high-ranking European traders and Ojibwe. The family was prominent among Native Americans, First Nations, and Europeans from both Canada and the United States. They had eight children who learned fluent Ojibwe, English and French. The Johnstons entertained a variety of trappers, explorers, traders, and government officials, especially during the years before the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States.

For more than 140 years, the settlement was a single community under French colonial, and later, British colonial rule. After the War of 1812, a US–UK Joint Boundary Commission finally fixed the border in 1817 between the Michigan Territory of the US and the British Province of Upper Canada to follow the river in this area. Whereas traders had formerly moved freely through the whole area, the United States forbade Canadian traders from operating in the United States, which reduced their trade and disrupted the area&#x27;s economy. The American and Canadian communities of Sault Ste. Marie were each incorporated as independent municipalities toward the end of the 19th century.

As a result of the fur trade, the settlement attracted Ojibwe and Ottawa, Métis, and ethnic Europeans of various nationalities. It was a two-tiered society, with fur traders (who had capital) and their families and upper-class Ojibwe in the upper echelon. In the aftermath of the War of 1812, however, the community&#x27;s society changed markedly.

The U.S. built Fort Brady near the settlement, introducing new troops and settlers, mostly Anglo-American. The UK and the US settled on a new northern boundary in 1817, dividing the US and Canada along St. Mary&#x27;s River. The US prohibited British fur traders from operating in the United States. After completion of the Erie Canal in New York State in 1825 (expanded in 1832), the number of settlers migrating to Ohio and Michigan increased dramatically from New York and New England, bringing with them the Yankee culture of the Northern Tier. Their numbers overwhelmed the cosmopolitan culture of the earlier settlers. They practiced more discrimination against Native Americans and Métis.

The falls proved a choke point for shipping between the Great Lakes. Early ships traveling to and from Lake Superior were portaged around the rapids in a lengthy process (much like moving a house) that could take weeks. Later, only the cargoes were unloaded, hauled around the rapids, and then loaded onto other ships waiting below the rapids. The first American lock, the State Lock, was built in 1855; it was instrumental in improving shipping. The lock has been expanded and improved over the years.

In 1900, Northwestern Leather Company opened a tannery in Sault Ste. Marie. The tannery was founded to process leather for the upper parts of shoes, which was finer than that for soles. After the factory closed in 1958, the property was sold to Filborn Limestone, a subsidiary of Algoma Steel Corporation.

In March 1938 during the Great Depression, Sophia Nolte Pullar bequeathed $70,000 for construction of the Pullar Community Building, which opened in 1939. This building held an indoor ice rink composed of artificial ice, then a revolutionary concept. The ice rink is still owned by the city.

==Geography==
The city is located at 46°49&#x27;N 84°35&#x27;W.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. The city&#x27;s downtown is on an island, formed by the Sault Ste. Marie Power Canal to the south and the St. Mary&#x27;s River and Soo Locks to the north.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Sault Ste. Marie has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and warm summers. Sault Ste. Marie is one of the snowiest places in Michigan, receiving an average of of snow per winter season, with a record year when fell. of snow fell in one five-day snowstorm, including in 24 hours, in December 1995. During this time, the city proper experienced a far greater level of snowfall than the farmlands past the canal and riverfront due to lake-effect snow. This caused the 1437th MRBC National Guard local armory to be mobilized for disaster relief in order to remove hundreds of tons of snow which effectively blockaded people within their own homes. Precipitation measured as equivalent rainfall, Sault Ste. Marie receives an annual average of . Its immediate region is the cloudiest in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, having over 200 cloudy days a year.

Temperatures in Sault Ste. Marie have varied between a record low of and a record high of . Monthly average temperatures range from in January to in July. On average, only two out of every five years reaches , while there are 85.5 days annually where the high remains at or below freezing and 26.5 nights with a low of or colder.

Average monthly precipitation is lowest in February, and highest in September and October. This autumn maximum in precipitation, unusual for humid continental climates, owes to this area&#x27;s Great Lakes location. From May through July (usually the year&#x27;s wettest months in most of the upper Midwestern United States, away from large bodies of water), the lake waters surrounding Sault Ste. Marie are cooler than nearby land areas. This tends to stabilize the atmosphere, suppressing precipitation (especially showers and thunderstorms) somewhat, in May, June and July. In autumn, the lakes are releasing their stored heat from the summer, making them warmer than the surrounding land, and increasingly frequent and strong polar and Arctic air outbreaks pick up warmth and moisture during their over-water passage, resulting in clouds and instability showers. In Sault Ste. Marie, this phenomenon peaks in September and October, making these the wettest months of the year. Also noteworthy is that in Sault Ste. Marie, the year&#x27;s third wettest month, on average, is November, and not any summer month.

;Notes: 
==Demographics==
As of the census of 2020, the population was 13,337. The population density was . There were 6,234 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 68.9% White, 17.8% Native American, 1.0% Black or African American, 0.9% Asian, 0.8% from other races, and 10.7% from two or more races. Ethnically, the population was 2.4% Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Economy==
Tourism is a major industry in the area. The Soo Locks and nearby Kewadin Casino, Hotel and Convention Center—which is owned by the Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians—are the major draws, as well as the forests, inland lakes, and Lake Superior shoreline. Sault Ste. Marie is also a gateway to Lake Superior&#x27;s scenic north shore through its twin city Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The two cities are connected by the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge, a steel truss arch bridge with suspended deck passing over the St. Marys River.

==Education==
===University===
Sault Ste. Marie is home to Lake Superior State University (LSSU), founded in 1946 as an extension campus of Michigan College of Mining and Technology (now Michigan Technological University); the campus was originally Fort Brady. LSSU is home to the LSSU Lakers (D1 Hockey (CCHA), D2 all other sports (GLIAC). LSSU has around 1500 students, making it Michigan&#x27;s smallest public university.

===Primary and secondary education===
The area school district is Sault Ste. Marie Area Schools.

The Sault&#x27;s primary public high school is Sault Area High School (SAHS). &quot;Sault High&quot; is one of the few high schools in the state with attached career center. The school&#x27;s mascot is the Blue Devil. &quot;Sault High&quot; houses a variety of successful varsity sports teams, such as hockey, wrestling, baseball, and basketball. Altogether, the school provides 24 competitive sports teams for both boys and girls at all levels. The school district also operates Malcolm High School as an alternative high school.

Sault Ste. Marie has two middle schools, one in the Sault Ste. Marie School System known as Sault Area Middle School. Before the 6th grade annex was added in the late 1980s, the school was referred to as Sault Area Junior High School. The Second Middle School is a part of Joseph K. Lumsden Bahweting School, a Native American-affiliated Public School Academy.

There are two elementary schools in Sault Ste. Marie, Lincoln Elementary and Washington Elementary. There is also a Public School Academy, Joseph K. Lumsden Bahweting School, and the St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School. Jefferson Elementary, McKinley Elementary, Bruce Township Elementary, and Soo Township Elementary (converted into an Alternative High School) have closed because of declining enrollment in the school system.

St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School serves students in grades K–8. It is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette.

There is a Bureau of Indian Education-affiliated tribal school, Joseph K. Lumsden Bahweting Anishnabe School. It was established in 1994 and received its current name in 1998.

Spectator sports in Sault Ste. Marie include Lake Superior State University Athletics and the Soo Eagles of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League (NOJHL). The Lakers participate in NCAA Division I Ice Hockey and Division II Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Basketball, Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Golf, Women&#x27;s Volleyball, Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Track and Field, Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Tennis and Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Cross Country. 

Nicknamed the Lakers, LSSU&#x27;s hockey program is celebrating its 59th season of intercollegiate competition. The team plays its home contests at Taffy Abel Arena (4,000 seats) on LSSU&#x27;s campus and is one of the most decorated programs in NCAA hockey history. The squad claimed two NAIA titles in the early 1970s (1972, 1974), before a run of three NCAA Division I championships (1988, 1992, 1994) and one finalist appearance (1993) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In total, the Lakers have made 11 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament appearances. The Lakers compete in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA).

The rest of the athletic teams play in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC). The basketball programs at LSSU have seen their share of success. The Men&#x27;s program won overall GLIAC regular season titles in 2014–15, 2013–14, 1995-1996 (Tournament Champion) and also claimed the north division crown in 2008–09. LSSU&#x27;s women&#x27;s program won GLIAC gold from 2001 to 2002 through 2004–05. They also captured GLIAC tournament titles in 2002–03 and 2003–04. Both Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s squads play their home games in the Bud Cooper Gymnasium within the Norris Center.

Sault Ste. Marie is the home of the International 500 Snowmobile Race (commonly called the I-500), which takes place annually and draws participants and spectators from all over the U.S. and Canada. The race, which was inspired by the Indianapolis 500, originated in 1969 and has been growing ever since.

==Transportation==
The city is home to the northern terminus of Interstate 75 (I-75), which connects with the Mackinac Bridge at St. Ignace approximately to the south, and continues south to near Miami. M-129 also has its northern terminus in the city. M-129 was at one time a part of the Dixie Highway system, which was intended to connect the northern industrial states with the southern agricultural states. Until 1984 the city was the eastern terminus of the western segment of US 2. County Highway H-63 (or Mackinac Trail) also has its northern terminus in the city and extends south to St. Ignace and follows a route very similar to I-75. The city is joined to its Canadian counterpart by the International Bridge, which connects I-75 in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Huron Street in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. 

Commercial airline service is provided to the city by the Chippewa County International Airport in Kinross, about south of the city. Smaller general aviation aircraft also use the Sault Ste. Marie Municipal Airport about one southwest of downtown.

Sault Ste. Marie was the namesake of the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway, now the Soo Line Railroad, the U.S. arm of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This railroad had a bridge parallel to the International Bridge crossing the St. Marys River. The Soo Line has since, through a series of acquisitions and mergers of portions of the system, been split between Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railway (CN). Canadian National operates the rail lines and the bridge in the Sault Ste. Marie area that were part of the Soo Line.

The Sugar Island Ferry provides automobile and passenger access between Sault Ste. Marie and Sugar Island, formerly a center of maple sugaring. The short route that the ferry travels crosses the shipping channel. Despite the high volume of freighter traffic through the locks, freighters typically do not dock in the Sault. However, the city hosts tugs, a tourist passenger ferry service, and a Coast Guard station along the shoreline on the lower (east) side of the Soo Locks. The United States Postal Service operates a &quot;Marine Post Office&quot;, situated within the locks, to service ships as they pass through.

Shipping traffic in the Great Lakes system bypasses the rapids in the St. Marys River via the American Soo Locks. Locally, it is often claimed to be the world&#x27;s busiest canal in terms of tonnage passing through it. The largest ships are long by wide. These are domestic carriers (called &quot;lakers&quot;). Smaller recreational and tour boats use the Canadian Sault Ste. Marie Canal. The lakers, being too large to transit the Welland Canal that bypasses Niagara Falls, are therefore land-locked. Foreign ships (termed &quot;salties&quot;) are smaller and can exit the Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River and the Atlantic Ocean.

==Notable landmarks==
* Pullar Stadium was constructed starting in 1937 and opened in 1939. It is used as an ice arena where the Soo Eagles play.
* The Ramada Plaza Hotel Ojiway opened on December 31, 1927. The first owners were Beatrice and Leon Daglman. The building is 95 years old. The 27th Governor of Michigan Chase S. Osborn donated the site and $50,000. It was his dream to build a nice elegant hotel. Overall, it cost $250,000 to build it. On the day of its opening it had 91 rooms, 33 of which included bath tubs, 13 with showers, 34 with toilet and washbowls, and 11 just had a washbowl. This hotel was made for all the tourist who came to the town. Governor Chase S. Osborn and his family lived on the sixth floor for a while and so did Beatrice and Leon Daglman. The hotel contains 100 guestrooms, dining room, checkroom, barbershop and beauty parlor. Its decorated as an Art Deco architectural design, décor, detailed amenities and exceptional service gained national interest and attracted many famous guests including Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis and more recently President George H.W. Bush in 1992.
*The Soo Theatre has been a part of Sault Ste. Marie for over 80 years and has provided entertainment of live plays, movies, and musicals. The Theatre opened in March 1930 and for 40 years was used for films and live performances. In May 1974 the theater was divided into red and blue cinemas, where a cement wall divided the once open auditorium. The building was then closed in 1998 and was put up for sale. In March 2003 the Soo Theatre Project Inc. purchased it for $85,000. After that the theater began restoration so plays and other types of entertainment could be put on once again.
*Holy Name of Mary Pro-Cathedral (Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan) was begun by Jesuits in 1668. There are only two other parishes, one in St. Augustine, Florida and the other in Santa Fe, New Mexico, that are older in the United States.[3] On January 9, 1857 Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Sault Ste. Marie[4] and St. Mary&#x27;s was named the cathedral church for the new diocese. The present church, the fifth for the parish, was built in 1881. It was designed by Canadian architect Joseph Connolly in the Gothic Revival style. The church was extensively remodeled in three phases from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. In 1968 the parish built the Tower of History as a shrine to the Catholic missionaries who served the community.[5] It was designed to be a part of a larger complex that was to include a community center and a new church. Parish priorities changed and the structure was sold to Sault Historic Sites in 1980, who continues to operate it. Proceeds from the Tower of History still benefit the church.
*The Soo Locks are a set of parallel locks which enable ships to travel between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes. They are on the St. Marys River between Lake Superior and Lake Huron, between the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. They bypass the rapids of the river, where the water falls 21 feet (7 m). The locks pass an average of 10,000 ships per year,[4] despite being closed during the winter from January through March, when ice shuts down shipping on the Great Lakes. The winter closure period is used to inspect and maintain the locks. The locks share a name (usually shortened and anglicized as Soo) with the two cities named Sault Ste. Marie, in Ontario and in Michigan, on either side of the St. Marys River. The Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge between the United States and Canada permits vehicular traffic to pass over the locks. A railroad bridge crosses the St. Marys River just upstream of the highway bridge.
*Taffy Abel Arena is the home of Lake Superior State University&#x27;s Division 1 hockey team. The 4,000-seat arena is part of the Norris Center athletic complex on LSSU&#x27;s campus. It was renovated in 1995 and is named after Clarence &quot;Taffy&quot; Abel. Abel was the first American born player to become an NHL regular and was born in the Soo.
*Lake Superior State University sits on the former site of U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Brady. The university has converted most of the buildings to serve housing and administrative needs for its students, faculty, guests and employees. The 115-acre campus includes several buildings which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The university has an enrollment of around 2500 students.

<text>De Marne () is a former municipality in the northeast of the Netherlands. On 1 January 2019 it merged with the municipalities of Bedum, Eemsmond and Winsum to form the new municipality Het Hogeland.

== Population centres ==
Broek, Eenrum, Hornhuizen, Houwerzijl, Kleine Huisjes, Kloosterburen, Kruisweg, Lauwersoog, Leens, Mensingeweer, Molenrij, Niekerk, Pieterburen, Schouwerzijl, Ulrum, Vierhuizen, Warfhuizen, Wehe-den Hoorn, Westernieland, Zoutkamp, Zuurdijk.

===Topography===
&quot;Dutch Topographic map of De Marne, June 2015&quot;

== A brief description ==
The municipality of De Marne lies in the north-western part of the province of Groningen, adjoining the Wadden Sea. It has about 10,000 inhabitants, covers an area of 240 square kilometres and encompasses 21 villages.

De Marne is mainly an agricultural area, focussing on crop growing and cattle farming. The fishing industry also plays an important role. Bulb cultivation is also an up-and-coming commercial endeavour.

===Maren===
De Marne has a large network of footpaths, cyclepaths, and sailing/canoeing routes. Of particular interest are the so-called &#x27;maren&#x27;: narrow waterways twisting and turning their way throughout the countryside. They are particularly suitable for recreational sailing and canoeing. The many marked walks, cycle routes and sail and drive routes connect all of the various villages.

===Special attractions===
Besides the well-known attractions such as the seal crèche in Pieterburen, the centre for mud flat walking and the Lauwersmeer area, there are also some other attractions. For instance, there is the Borg Verhildersum in Leens, Abraham&#x27;s Mustard Museum in Eenrum and many churches, towers, listed heritage farms, terps and protected village settings. There are also famous church organs built by Arp Schnitger, Lohman (family) and Hinsz.

===Pilgrimage===

The hermitage of Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden in Warfhuizen is a popular Marian shrine. Processions go from Wehe-den Hoorn to Warfhuizen four or five times a year. A unique devotional practice is the &#x27;swapping of the handkerchief&#x27;. According to Spanish tradition the statue of the crying Virgin usually holds a white handkerchief. The faithful bring a new white handkerchief and give it to the hermit to swap it with the one the Virgin has been holding which, in turn, is then given to someone sick or lonely. Students take it to their exams to calm their nerves.

===The Lauwersmeer area===
The Lauwersmeer area is a nature area suitable for fishing, bird watching, walking, and cycling. It features a few waters ports. The area covers about 90 square kilometres. The Lauwersmeer area came into existence when the Lauwerszee was closed off in 1969. Over the years the salt has slowly retreated from the water and new countryside has emerged.

===Local products===
There are a number of typical products of the area. An example of this is the &#x27;Spelt Project&#x27;. This project ensures the production of pure local products. Farmers, millers, bakers, upholsterers and distillers work together to produce old-fashioned spelt grain, flour, bread, gin and cushions filled with spelt husks.

===Municipal reorganisation===
The municipality came into being in 1990 when the smaller municipalities of Eenrum, Kloosterburen, Leens and Ulrum were joined together. The local government employs about 115 people.
== Notable people ==

* Hendrik Nicolaas Werkman (1882 in Leens – 1945) an experimental Dutch artist, typographer and printer
* Cornelis Simon Meijer (1904 in Pieterburen – 1974) a Dutch mathematician and academic
* Sicco Mansholt (1908 in Ulrum – 1995) a Dutch politician and diplomat
* Martin Zijlstra (1944 in Eenrum – 2014) a Dutch politician

==Communities==
* Bath is an unincorporated community and census-designated place located within the western portion of the township.

== History ==

Bath Township was originally organized in 1839 as Ossowa Township, having been split from DeWitt Township by an act of the governor. It was renamed Bath Township in 1843 after Bath, New York.

Park Lake at the southern edge of the township was the source of the Park Lake Trail, an important Native American trailway that intersected the Okemah Trail in what later became the city of East Lansing, Michigan. Park Lake developed into a regional recreation destination for the growing Lansing population after the state capitol relocated to Lansing in 1847. The Michigan Agricultural College was established in East Lansing, Michigan in 1855. By the early 1900s Park Lake was surrounded by summer camps affiliated with various churches and associations as well as seasonal cabins and lodges. The most ambitious of these was the Park Lake Resort which featured a large dance pavilion built on pilings over the water. The Park Lake Dance Pavilion served as an entertainment venue playing host to many famous acts such as Tommy Dorsey until it burned in the 1930s. Years of decline followed and Park Lake never regained its former popularity.

Bath Township was the scene of the Bath School bombing, which is the deadliest act of mass murder in a school in United States history. It claimed more than three times as many victims as the Columbine High School massacre and twice as many victims as the Virginia Tech and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings.

<text>Westlake Village is a city in Los Angeles County, California on its western border with Ventura County. Upon its incorporation in 1981, Westlake Village became the 82nd municipality of Los Angeles County. The population of the city was 8,029 at the 2020 census, down from 8,270 at the 2010 census.

The city is named after the master-planned community surrounding Westlake Lake. With the lake at the center, the community straddles the line between Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Roughly two-thirds of the community is in the Ventura County city of Thousand Oaks.

==History==
 About 3,000 years ago, the Chumash moved into the region and lived by hunting rabbits and other game, and gathering grains and acorns. Excavations, archaeological sites, and polychrome rock paintings in the area provide a glimpse into the social and economic complexity of the ancient Chumash world.

A Chumash village was settled here in 500 BCE, known as Hipuc. The Chumash Indians gathered and prepared acorns and other seeds. These were collected in the fall. The Chumash also hunted wild animals, fish and gathered plants. Their diet consisted of acorns, gophers, cottontail rabbits, skunks, jack rabbits, rats, mice, and seeds. They made their clothing from the skins of animals such as rabbits, deer, and sea otters. Women wore long skirts woven from grass or soft bark, while men wore pieces of deerskin tied around their waists. Both men and women painted designs on their bodies and wore shell beads.

On a return trip from Northern California in January 1770, a group of men led by Gaspar de Portolá are believed to be the first Europeans to encounter the Chumash Indians in the Conejo Valley. Father Juan Crespí, chaplain and diarist of the expedition, wrote about El Triumfo, a Chumash village. He wrote that there was plenty of water and firewood in the village, and that the land was covered with pastures. He wrote: &quot;We are on a plain of considerable extent and much beauty, forested on all parts by live oaks and oak trees, with much pasturage and water.&quot; Crespí named the place &quot;El triunfo del Dulcísimo Nombre de Jesús&quot; (in English: &quot;The Triumph of the Sweetest Name of Jesus&quot;) to a camping place by a creek.

Other villages were found throughout the valley, including Satwiwa and two villages near Ventu Park Road in Newbury Park. These Chumash villages are believed by archeologists to have first been settled over 2,000 years ago. Another village was located by Lake Sherwood.

In 1795, the area became part of one of the first Spanish land grants, Rancho Simi, given to the Pico family of California. When Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, Alta California became Mexican territory, and the Rancho Simi grant was confirmed in 1842.

In 1881, the Russell brothers purchased a large portion of the land for cattle ranching. According to Patricia Allen, historian and family descendant, Andrew Russell beat the competition in buying the land by racing across 6,000 acres (24 km) on a fifteen-minute trip in a buckboard and sealed the deal with a $20 gold piece. The price per acre was $2.50. The area continued to be known as the Russell Ranch although it was sold in 1925 to William Randolph Hearst and again in 1943 to Fred Albertson. The Russell family leased back part of the land to continue its successful cattle ranch operation while the Albertson Company used the vast area as a movie ranch. Many movies and television shows were filmed in the Conejo Valley, including &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;King Rat&quot;, &quot;Laredo&quot;, and various episodes of &quot;Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Bonanza&quot;. The 1940 film &quot;Danger Ahead&quot; was filmed on Westlake Boulevard.
In 1963, Daniel K. Ludwig&#x27;s American-Hawaiian Steamship Company bought the 12,000 acre (49 km) ranch for $32 million and, in partnership with Prudential Insurance Company, commissioned the preparation of a master plan by architectural and planning firm A. C. Martin and Associates. This new &quot;city in the country&quot; planned to have a firm economic base including commercial areas, residential neighborhoods, and ample green space with the lake as a focal point. Prominent architects, engineers, and land planners participated in designing the new community, a distinctive example of planned 1960s-style suburbanism.

The original tract was divided by the Los Angeles/Ventura county line. In 1968 and 1972, two portions of the Westlake development consisting of on the Ventura County side were annexed into the city of Thousand Oaks. In 1981, the Los Angeles County portion ( or roughly 1/3) of the Westlake master-planned community was incorporated as the City of Westlake Village. California state law prevents a city from existing in two separate counties.

==Geography==

In addition to being a bedroom community for Los Angeles via the Ventura (101) Freeway, Westlake Village is also home to many large commercial offices and the headquarters of the Dole Food Company, K-Swiss and J.D. Power and Associates. The western regional office (Region 5) of Anheuser-Busch Inc. is also located in the community. Pacific Coast Highway and the Ronald Reagan (CA 118) Freeway also run nearby. It is a short drive to the mall in Thousand Oaks.

Much of Westlake Village is surrounded by open space, including hiking and horse trails, as well as the vast Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The town is in the northwestern Santa Monica Mountains area, and is inland from the Pacific Ocean. The area is within a wildlife corridor linking the Santa Monica Mountains with other undeveloped habitat. Mountain lions have been seen roaming the neighborhoods. The lake lies within the watershed of Malibu Creek. Water from the lake must be released into the creek in compliance with an agreement between the California State Water Resources Control Board and the Westlake Lake Management Association, a private entity that oversees the operation of the lake.

The area has several golf courses: the Westlake Golf Course, Sherwood Country Club, and North Ranch Country Club.

Over one half of the original &quot;Westlake&quot; development lies west across the county line, wholly within the city limits of Thousand Oaks. This boundary, which divides the incorporated City of Westlake Village and the Thousand Oaks portion of Westlake Village, crosses over the Westlake Golf Course, halfway between Lakeview Canyon and Lindero Canyon roads, and half of the lake itself. Lake Sherwood is nearby.

The City of Westlake Village is located approximately west of downtown Los Angeles in the Conejo Valley. Other communities in the surrounding area include Thousand Oaks, Oak Park, Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Newbury Park, and Malibu.

===Climate===
Coastal breezes sweep through canyons to allow Westlake to sometimes be up to 10 degrees cooler and considerably less hazy than nearby San Fernando Valley during the summer months. However, it generally remains 10 degrees hotter than the coastal plains below the Conejo Grade, in the communities of Santa Rosa Valley, Camarillo, and Ventura among others.

<text>DeWitt is a city in Clinton County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,776 at the 2020 census. The city is located north of Interstate 69 and west of U.S. Route 127, just north of the city of Lansing.

==History==
DeWitt was named after DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York during the 1820s. It was first settled by Captain David Scott, who moved there from Ann Arbor in 1833, and platted the land. The State Legislature formally created DeWitt Township on March 23, 1836. The first township meeting was held at the house of Captain Scott on April 8, 1836. A gentleman by the name of Welcome J. Partelo was named the township&#x27;s first Supervisor at that meeting.

It did not take long for the state to divide DeWitt Township into the many townships that we recognize today. In 1837, the township was split in half by a north–south line; the western half became Watertown Township. Two years later, the township was again split in half by an east–west line, and the northern half became Bingham Township. One day later, the governor approved an act, which split the remaining township area in half by an east–west line, and the eastern half became Ossowa Township (renamed Bath Township in 1857). The final split of the township came in 1841 when the northern half of the remaining land became Olive Township. In four years, DeWitt Township went from encompassing the entire county to its current boundary.

The county seat for Clinton County was also located in DeWitt Township from the inception of the county. The county seat remained in DeWitt Township until December 1857 when it was moved to high Hall, in the village of St. Johns, until a new courthouse could be built.

In the early 1900s, the Lansing, St. Johns and St. Louis Railway opened the community to a new era of prosperity. It was not until 1929 when the town was incorporated as a village, and then was no longer under the full jurisdiction of the township.

The area that is now the city was first incorporated as a village in 1929.

On October 21, 1930, a great fire swept though the downtown business district, destroying eight historic and business buildings. This included the destruction of the Clinton House/Hotel, which was a regionally famous establishment. The fire devastated the community, stagnating business growth once again. However, residential development did not slow, and thus DeWitt began its evolvement into the bedroom community that it is today.

The Village of Dewitt was incorporated into a city in 1965.
The DeWitt area was ranked as the 75th best place to live in the United States by CNN Money in 2005.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

DeWitt is on the Looking Glass River, a tributary of the Grand River.

<text>Fowler is a village in Clinton County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,226 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Dallas Township.

== History ==
Originally called &quot;Dallas&quot;, Fowler was created when Robert Highman, Chief Engineer of the Detroit, Grand Haven, and Milwaukee Railroad, and E.A Wales acquired a tract of land along the railroad right-of-way in 1857. The Detroit, Grand Haven, and Milwaukee railroad completed the rail line though the area in July and August 1857. Dallas was later changed to Isabella and subsequently Fowler.
A few years after the founding of Dallas, the town had little economic growth and was subsequently moved to a tract of land 1/10 of a mile west of the original tract, owned by John N. Fowler and in 1869 the name was changed to &quot;Fowler&quot;. The village was originally settled in a swampy area and the move was driven by the lack of economic growth. 
In 1885, the town was incorporated as a village in Clinton County, reportedly during a high growth lumber boom.

In 1905, massive flooding in the area washed out a culvert three and a half miles west of town. A Grand Trunk work train was sent to repair the culvert but plunged into the creek, killing five men.

Fowler remains a small rural community, serving the needs of the local farming community and as a satellite community to Lansing.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (2.22%) is water.

=== Mint production ===

Near the turn of the century, high demand for mint oil in medicines and candy from companies like Wrigley caused a surge in demand for mint farming. The rich, organic, muck soil of Clinton County makes the area around St. Johns particularly well-suited for mint farming. As a result, many mint farmers cultivated mint. The Crosby Mint Farm, established by J.E. Crosby in 1912, claims to be the oldest continuously family-operated mint farm in the United States.

Today Clinton County ranks first in Michigan in regards to total mint production.
St. Johns is known as the Mint City and has been called &quot;The Mint Capital of the World.&quot;

Each year since 1985, St. Johns celebrates its mint farming heritage with the St. Johns Mint Festival. The festival typically takes place on the second weekend in August.

<doc id="117358" wikidata="Q322986" url="?curid=117358" title="Delfzijl">
<text>Delfzijl (; ) is a city and former municipality (which now belongs to the municipality of Eemsdelta) with a population of 25,651 in the province of Groningen in the northeast of the Netherlands. Delfzijl was a sluice between the Delf and the Ems, which became fortified settlement in the 16th century. The fortifications were removed in the late 19th century. Delfzijl is the fifth largest seaport in the Netherlands, and the largest port in the North East of the country.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Delfzijl&quot; means &#x27;sluice of the Delf&#x27;. The Delf was a canal connecting the rivers Fivel and Ems, and is now part of the Damsterdiep. The Dutch verb &quot;delven&quot; means &#x27;to delve&#x27; or &#x27;to dig&#x27; and the Dutch noun &quot;zijl&quot; means &#x27;water outlet&#x27; or &#x27;sluice&#x27;.

== History ==
Delfzijl was established at the location where three sluices () were connected. In 1317, a sluice was built in the Delf, a canal which is now part of the Damsterdiep. Delfzijl has been the main sea port of Groningen since medieval times.

In 1580, a square sconce and a church were built in Delfzijl. Fortification was expanded with six bastions in 1591. Also In 1591 Prince Maurice of Orange visited the port with a fleet of 150 ships which saw the capture of the city from the Spanish by a combined Dutch and English army. Following this an unsuccessful attempt was made in 1594 by Francisco Verdugo to capture the fortress Delfzijl. In 1628 Piet Hein moored his silver fleet at Delfzijl. The first sea battle in the Eighty Years&#x27; War was fought nearby in 1658 in the Eems estuary between Dutch forces under Jan Abels and Spanish forces under François van Boshuizen. A fleet of Dutch ships from the West Indies landed here in 1665 under command of admiral Michiel de Ruyter, avoiding the English fleet that was blockading the Dutch coast. The fortification and the sluices were damaged during the Christmas Flood of 1717. In 1813–1814, the French held the city, while it was under siege by the Dutch. The fortifications were removed in 1875, making room for the train station, and leaving one branch of the moat for recreational purposes, with ice skating in some years.

The town was damaged in World War II, and artifacts of the battle can be found in monuments, bunkers, and old armored vehicles usually on display, but disrupted now since 2017 by a major reconstruction of the water front area. Nearby a group of museums attractively landscaped near woodlands and an indoor public swimming pool, an aquarium, and a sea dike, are also affected by the construction intending to make Delfzijl a better tourist attraction after the construction and more secure from sea flooding.

Delfzijl sits at an elevation above low tide, and usually above high tide except for a few days per year. The town is protected by dikes and gates that can be opened to let water out at low tide, and closed to prevent flooding at high tide. When normal draining at low tide is not sufficient water is pumped near Delfzijl at Farmsum in a modern pumping station that replaced the historical old pump house in the 1970s. The possibility of rising sea level is a large concern in Delfzijl, and storms have occasionally splashed water over the sea dikes in recent years causing the dike to be raised starting in 2017.

Traditional industries of grain milling, paper made from straw, and bricks made from clay have given way to newer industries and technologies. Colonial days are remembered in Delfzijl by Indonesian food and a variety of minority groups who are integrated into the community.

On the edge of Delfzijl, and easily approached on foot or by bicycle across new parks and wood lands, the church at Uitwierde with its free standing tower dates from about the year 1200. The church sits on a historic protected artificial mound that dates from antiquity, and was necessary before dikes were built. The church pipe organ dates from 1888 and was moved from Heveskes in 1975. In the area are a few estates and manor houses with historic restaurants of interest as well as numerous farm houses and villages with old churches of historic interest.

Industrial expansion in the 1970s and 1980s displaced old villages of Weiwerd and Heveskes which are remembered in photos and local monuments maintained by previous residents. Foundations of a ruined monastery were discovered in the excavations of Heveskes mound, together with a monolithic tomb dated from 3400 BC which was disrupted about 2200 BC and was displayed in the Aquarium Museum at Delfzijl, until recent developments caused the building to be demolished. The monastery was mentioned in records of 1319, and was destroyed in war in 1586. The village of Oterdum which was built against an older section of sea dike was flooded occasionally by storms and was demolished in the 1970s for raising the dike elevation. Coffins traditionally buried in the old dike were moved to Farmsum, leaving monuments in the enlarged dike to commemorate the village and cemetery. A few Kilometers farther down the coast are the villages of Borgsweer and Termunten that give some idea of the traditional land use before industrial expansion. Nearby at Termunterzijl is located a gate in the sea dike and a small marina inside the fresh water harbor, giving an idea of how Delfzijl looked in the early years.

== Geography ==
Delfzijl is located at in the northeast of the province of Groningen, in the northeast of the Netherlands. It is situated on the southwest bank of the Ems estuary, which forms the border with Germany.

Delfzijl was bordered by the Dutch municipalities of Eemsmond (in the northwest), Loppersum (west), Appingedam (west), Slochteren (southwest), Oldambt (south), and by the German municipalities of Emden (east) and Krummhörn (northeast).

The former municipality contained the population centres:

* Bierum
* Biessum
* Borgsweer
* Delfzijl
* Farmsum
* Godlinze
* Holwierde
* Krewerd
* Losdorp
* Meedhuizen
* Spijk
* Termunten
* Termunterzijl
* Uitwierde
* Wagenborgen
* Weiwerd
* Woldendorp
== Economy ==


The Port of Delfzijl is the fifth biggest seaport in the Netherlands and the home of an aluminium plant run by the company Aluminium Delfzijl (part of Tata Steel Europe). In 2004 the smelter produced a record 112,400 tonnes of liquid aluminium. The foundry produced 157,700 tonnes of raw product. Natural gas and petroleum fields in the area encourage industries to locate in the industrial zones.

Delfzijl is also known for its chemical industry and a large salt production plant held by AkzoNobel . On the edge of the town lies an industrial site with an area of 3 square kilometers which is one of the biggest employers in the area. This site is responsible for the second largest quantity of exported chemicals in the Netherlands (after Rotterdam), and is known for its major exports of chlorine and related products.

Favorable winds are used to make electricity in modern wind turbines located away from the historical districts. The old wind mills are only used on special occasions.

A modern fresh water shipping canal connects Delfzijl with Groningen City and most of The Netherlands, bypassing the historical canals that are used for recreation. Delfzijl has a strong tradition of seafaring and there is a specialized school to train employees for the shipping industry located nearby in the fresh water port area established in 1930. After some years at sea the graduates are highly regarded and recruited by local industry where they work as factory operators, mechanics, supervisors, or practical engineers. The inland fresh water port is extensive with several canals coming together, making a sheltered loading area and facilities for hauling out smaller ships for refitting and inspections.

Farmlands occupy most of the region producing potatoes, sugar beets, oil seeds, grain, dairy products, cattle and wool making Delfzijl a local market town and adding to the economy. Much commerce occurs with the agricultural center in Veendam that previously operated a chamber of commerce for the region. Building of small ships occurs along modern canals in nearby Winschoten, with rail and ship connections to Germany, adding to the commercial traffic around Delfzijl.

Fishing is done in the shallow seas with some of the boats operating out of Delfzijl and Farmsum harbor where much inland shipping is also handled. An old sea gate at Farmsum was replaced by newer gates nearby leaving a sheltered inland harbor. Low tide exposes extensive mud flats that add to tourism and environmental activities. Delfzijl is a bird sanctuary during high tides that cover the feeding grounds with sea water.

Considerable lumber is imported to supplement domestic supplies. A wide variety of cargoes from all over the world are handled by the port, which also receives visiting navy ships from NATO countries. Delfzijl harbors can accommodate boats of various types as well as small to medium-sized ships. Large ships can be handled in the new Eemshaven port near by at the mouth of the Eems estuary. Together the two harbors are promoted as industrial development areas under the name Groningen Province Sea Ports. The two ports give regular service to north sea petroleum production and staging grounds for new constructions in the north sea fields.

==Transportation==
There are two railway stations in municipality giving frequent service to Groningen and points in between, with connections to other locations: 
*Delfzijl railway station
*Delfzijl West railway station
A branch of the railroad tracks passes through gates in the sea dike to serve the harbor area and near by industries.

The regional airport of Groningen at Eelde serves Delfzijl and the surrounding areas.

Local and regional busses connect Delfzijl to outlying villages and other towns. The large trucking company Lommerts has offices and terminals in Delfzijl harbor area connecting with sea going traffic.

Modern highways link Delfzijl with destinations in Europe, and easy access to inland resort areas near Gieten in Drenthe on weekends. A system of old and new draw bridges manages the flow of traffic across canals and around locks where water level is raised and lowered. Parking space is provided in various places, some of which impose a time limit and require a permit that can be purchased inexpensively. Some parking permits are also valid in other places of The Netherlands and foreign countries.

Delfzijl provides bicycle paths and traffic signals for pedestrians and cyclists. Special permissions and permits apply to small motor bikes not more than 50cc motor displacement or electric power not more than 4 kilowatts traveling not more than 45 kilometers per hour and within the local speed limit on streets and roads where they are allowed. Other permissions apply to larger motorbikes which are usually found with automobile traffic. Many people prefer to walk in Delfzijl which is made possible by reasonable distances, low crime rate, and mild maritime climate that is often cloudy, cool, wet, and windy.

==Events==
Every five years the city organises DelfSail, the second-largest sailing event of the Netherlands after SAIL Amsterdam. Part of the sea harbor near the center of Delfzijl is open to public on Sundays and special events are occasionally held when the heavy machinery is not moving and the sea gates are not closed.

Annually the &quot;Pinksterfeesten&quot; (Whitsunfestivities or Pentecost Festival) are organised in the city. Delfzijl is seeing a strong resurgence in the Dutch economy as the physical centerpoint of Energy Valley. This is the result of a strategic collaboration with the German town of Emden on the other side of the Eems Estuary, and North Sea natural gas that comes on shore near Delfzijl.

==Society==
Delfzijl has a cultural center with meeting rooms, cinema, theater, and concert hall near the central wind mill for live performances and films, with additional cultural facilities in Groningen.

Education is available for people of all ages including those who travel to nearby Groningen University. Parents of school aged children participate in school activities several times a year around national holidays and school year schedules. Affordable health care is provided to everyone in, clinics, house calls, at a local hospital, and at the Groningen Academic Hospital which was established in 1797.

Government officials are mostly appointed and operate with advice of elected local councils and parliaments in Groningen and The Hague. Authorities for public safety, city services, oversight of industry, harbor control, and management of water levels have a strong presence in Delfzijl and can call on assistance from trained volunteers when needed. Many political parties are active in Delfzijl, with much support given to labor, business, education, religious views, family values, and environmental protection. Small business shop keepers have a large influence on the city. There is much freedom of speech and action for people who are respectful of laws and authorities.

Many social activities take place in cafes, pubs, churches, and sports clubs. The residents keep their window blinds open at home in celebration of long lasting peace, but are otherwise protective of privacy. Most religious activities of Delfzijl are in the Dutch Protestant Established (Hervormde Kerk) or Reformed (Gereformeerde Kerk) churches, with notable minorities active in Catholic, Lutheran, and Baptist churches. Most of the churches in Delfzijl are joined in local and national organizations, although they retain much of their individual character. Salvation army is also active and included in the churches organization. A number of national holidays are celebrated each year, the biggest are Christmas, Easter, and the King&#x27;s Birthday. Sports facilities are available and boating is popular in the sea, canals, and near by lakes.

Housing and commerce in Delfzijl is a blending of old and new facilities with architectural attention given to the unity and harmony of the town&#x27;s appearance. New housing on the north side and west side of Delfzijl retain elements of traditional styles while providing modern facilities. Ownership in different parts of Delfzijl is also a blend of private and public property.

Modern Dutch language is understood everywhere and young educated people speak English, German, and French. Gronings dialect is found routinely spoken in outlying villages, resembling old dialects along the coast nearby in Germany and Denmark. Local television carries Dutch and popular broadcasts from other countries and languages. Delfzijl is accustomed to receiving visitors and guest workers from foreign countries.

<text>Westphalia is a village in Clinton County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 924 at the time of the 2020 census. The village is in Westphalia Township, about northwest of Lansing and east of Grand Rapids. The village is known for its German and Catholic roots.

== History ==
Westphalia was founded in 1836 by a group of German settlers. It was named after the province of Westphalia in Germany.
These settlers were German Catholics who emigrated from the Westphalian cities of Wimbach, Meerhof, and from Hesse, among others, and found the rich soil ideal for farming. Some family members stayed in Detroit, while others moved into the wilderness to clear farmland. The German-Catholic parish was established almost immediately after the settlers arrived. After buying the land at Ionia, Father Anton Kopp traveled to Detroit to visit Bishop Friedrich Reese, and returned to his assigned parish in September 1837, where he celebrated Masses in the homes of the settlers in what is now St. Mary&#x27;s Parish.

In 2012, the village celebrated its 175th anniversary.

<text>Grayling ( &quot;&quot;) is a city and the county seat of Crawford County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the only incorporated community in Crawford County. The population was 1,884 at the 2010 census. The city is surrounded by Grayling Charter Township, but the two are administered autonomously.

The city is located in the middle of the Northern Michigan region at the junctions of Interstate 75, U.S. Route 127, M-72, and M-93. Grayling is well known for hosting the Au Sable River Canoe Marathon in July of every year since 1947. The city is named after the Grayling species of fish once abundant in the Au Sable River, although the species has been extirpated in Michigan since 1936. There have been many attempts to bring Grayling back to the area but none have been successful.

==History==

Michael Shoat Hartwick was Grayling&#x27;s first settler. On the west side of the railroad tracks, he built a log hotel. The railroad platted out 40 acres (where Grayling now stands), naming it &quot;Crawford&quot;. Fish swimming in the river were identified as grayling, and it is said that the residents preferred the name &quot;Grayling&quot; to the name &quot;Crawford,&quot; and renamed the area after the fish.

Grayling&#x27;s access to two major rivers (Au Sable River and Manistee River), and the presence of the vast forest around it, made it important in the lumber era. Logs were floated down the rivers to the lakes.

Grayling had other names through the years. It was called &quot;AuSable&quot;, &quot;Forest&quot;, &quot;Crawford Station&quot;, and during the lumbering era &quot;Milltown&quot;.

The Arctic grayling that had inhabited much of Northern Michigan was eventually wiped out. The logging practice of using river beds to move logs in the springtime destroyed the breeding grounds for these fish. Before they could recover, non-native sport fish such as brook trout were introduced in the 1890s and competed with the grayling for food.

The Grayling Fish Hatchery was founded in 1914 by timber baron Rasmus Hanson (1846–1927). He hoped to restore the grayling to the Au Sable River system; ironically, its disappearance was caused, at least in part, by the massive habitat destruction caused by logging, which was the source of Mr. Hanson&#x27;s and other lumber barons&#x27; immense wealth. Other famous contributors to the initial costs of the hatchery included Henry Ford, Edsel Ford, and Thomas Edison. The grayling became extinct in Michigan. Nevertheless, the hatchery continued to play an important role in natural resource conservation. In 1926, it was sold to the state of Michigan. It continued to be operated as a fish hatchery and tourist attraction until the mid-1960s. In 1995, Michigan sold the property to Crawford County. It is being operated by a privately owned fish farm, although continues to be open to the public during the summer.

An important person in the history of Grayling is Rasmus Hanson. Hanson was born in 1846 in Denmark and emigrated to the United States some time later. At age 16 he began working in the lumber field. Two years later, E. N. Salling, Nelson Michelson, and he organized the first Salling-Hanson Company. After nearly 50 years of service, the Salling Hanson Company had shut down its operation in January 1927. He was a successful entrepreneur and created many businesses in Northern Michigan. Along with being one of three lumber barons of Northern Michigan, Hanson owned the Michigan Sugar Company and the Bay City Sugar Company. In 1916, he donated 13,826 acres of cut-over land in Crawford County to the state of Michigan for use as a forest game preserve and military reservation. This land became the first state-owned game preserve. The area south of Lake Margrethe (named in honor of Hanson&#x27;s wife, Margrethe) continues to be used as a National Guard base that serves Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana guards. Since 1947, Grayling has been the starting point of the Au Sable River Canoe Marathon, which is held every year on the last weekend of July. This is the longest nonstop canoe race in North America.
