<text>Blair is a city in and the county seat of Washington County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 7,990 at the 2010 census. Blair is a part of the Omaha-Council Bluffs Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Blair was platted in 1869 when the Sioux City and Pacific Railroad was extended to that point. It was named for railroad magnate John Insley Blair, who was credited with bringing the railroad to town. Blair was incorporated as a city in 1872. Within its first year, Blair was designated county seat.

In March 1869, a small child playing on a railroad turntable in town was injured on the turntable. The father sued the railway for damages, leading all the way up to the Supreme Court of the United States in the 1873 case &quot;Sioux City &amp; Pacific Railroad Co. v. Stout&quot;.
In 1874, during the Panic of 1873, a grasshopper storm enveloped the region. Many Nebraskans were faced with starvation. An organization, the Nebraska Relief and Aid Society was formed in order to help affected persons. A law was passed by congress awarding $100,000 relief, and many Blair citizens were awarded money. Both the newspapers and the railroads in the region helped transport supplies free of charge. Both the Nebraska State Guard and the United States Army helped distribute food and clothing.

Construction of the Chicago and Northwestern Bridge across the Missouri River was authorized by an Act of Congress on June 27, 1882. Construction began in September 1882, and it was open for rail traffic in November 1883. The total cost of the bridge was $1.13 Million ($34.2 Million in 2023). The first automobile bridge was opened to traffic in 1929.

In 1916, Blair was awarded a $10,000 grant to build a Carnegie Library. Unfortunately, an electrical fire occurred on the night of July 23, 1973, and the historic library was deemed a total loss.

On April 26, 2024, portions of Blair were struck by a large EF4 tornado, destroying or damaging dozens of homes.

<text>Red Cloud is a city in and the county seat of Webster County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 962 at the 2020 census. 

==History==
The region of present-day Red Cloud was intermittently occupied and used as hunting grounds by the Pawnees until 1833. In that year, a treaty was signed in which the Pawnees surrendered their lands south of the Platte River. According to George Hyde, it is likely that the Pawnees did not realize that they were thereby giving up their lands, and that they were led to believe that they were only granting the Delawares and other relocated tribes permission to hunt in the area.
In 1870, the area that is now Webster County was opened to homesteaders. In that year, Silas Garber and other settlers filed claims along Crooked Creek, just east of the present-day city. In 1871, the town, named after the renowned Oglala Lakota leader Red Cloud, was voted county seat of the newly formed county. The city was platted in 1872.

The author Willa Cather lived in Red Cloud with her family for seven years, starting in 1883 at age nine, and later visited often. She used the town as inspiration for several in her novels, including Black Hawk in &quot;My Ántonia&quot;. Early articles by Cather were published in the city&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Red Cloud Chief&quot;. Several 19th-century buildings described in her books are part of the Willa Cather Historic District, the largest district dedicated to an author listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Her childhood home is also part of the district.

== History ==
The village of Milford began with the building of a sawmill by Elizur and Stanley Ruggles in 1832. Early county records indicate that the mill was erected in the &quot;Township&quot; at that time, and that formal organization would occur in 1834. That same year, the first gristmill was erected by Luman Fuller. In 1835, the first post office was established with Aaron Phelps as postmaster.

The Lower Mill Pond was created in 1836 to provide waterpower for the various types of mills and factories. The Upper Mill Pond followed in 1845. In 1911, the Hubbell Pond was created by a dam built on the Huron River to generate electricity. The village was incorporated in 1869.

Hydropower made it possible for Milford to become one of the first communities to have electric lights, in 1892. A year later, telephone service was available in the Village. As a point of reference, nearby South Lyon did not have electric lights until 1932.

By 1939, Henry Ford built a carburetor plant and two hydroelectric stations intended to allow residents to maintain their agricultural work while working in the factories. The former carburetor plant was demolished in 2002. The Art Deco station still remains on Pettibone Creek in the village, and restoration work began in 2004.

The summer of 2017 was the first year that the village has allowed golf carts on their streets. By November, only 10 carts were registered.

== Government ==
As a village, Milford is provided assessing, counties and school districts tax collecting and elections administration for county, state and national by Milford Township. The Village of Milford is a Michigan home rule village with a council-manager form of government. The village is governed by a local charter adopted by village electors. The village council appoints a Village Manager to serve as the CAO of the government, responsible for the management of the village&#x27;s daily operations and oversight of all departments.

<text>A spa town is a resort town based on a mineral spa (a developed mineral spring). Patrons visit spas to &quot;take the waters&quot; for their purported health benefits. 

Thomas Guidott set up a medical practice in the English town of Bath in 1668. He became interested in the curative properties of the hot mineral waters there and in 1676 wrote &quot;A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water&quot;. This brought the purported health-giving properties of the waters to the attention of the aristocracy, who started to partake in them soon after.

The term &quot;spa&quot; is used for towns or resorts offering hydrotherapy, which can include cold water or mineral water treatments and geothermal baths, and comes from the Belgian town Spa.

==Spa towns by country==

There are mineral springs in the Central Highlands of Victoria. Most are in and around Daylesford and Hepburn Springs. Daylesford and Hepburn Springs call themselves &quot;Spa Country&quot; and the &quot;Spa Centre of Australia&quot;.

In Queensland, many towns have mineral springs created by artesian bores into the Great Artesian Basin, often the only or primary water supply to the towns. Some of these towns had periods of popularity as spa towns, including Ararmac, Barcaldine, Dalby, Helidon, Innot Hot Springs, and Muckadilla, mostly in the late 1800s and early 1900s when mineral spas were believed to cure various medical conditions. However, the remote locations of most of these towns made them expensive to visit and only small-scale spa facilities developed there. Helidon, a day trip from Brisbane by car, was more successful, particularly with growing owernship of cars after World War II. However, concerns about radioactivity and bacterial contamination resulted in the Helidon Spa falling into disuse by 1994. Many towns in Queensland continue to provide bathing facilities fed by hot springs, but these are promoted as relaxing holiday activities rather than as medical treatments.

Receiving abundant snowfall and experiencing mild summer temperatures, the area around Gaylord has long been known for its many skiing and golf resorts, one of the largest such concentrations in the Midwestern United States.

==History==

=== Founding and early years ===
The town was unofficially called Barnes, after secretary of the Michigan Central Railroad and state representative Orlando Barnes, the town was settled in 1873 when the Jackson, Lansing, and Saginaw Railroads were extended north from Otsego Lake Village in the same year. All property north of Main Street was owned by the railroad. Barnes owned all of the property to the south. Main Street was the borderline for two townships. This put the northern half of the new community in Livingston Township and the southern portion in Bagley Township.

The town became known as the “Village of Gaylord” in 1874, in the same year, Gaylord was also granted a post office of the same name. If the community was truly ever named Barnes, the name change would have occurred between November 1873 and October 1874. William F. Parmater, a township supervisor was appointed to find a location for the town&#x27;s court house in November 1877, Parmater and George Smith, a local store owner were given land owned by Barnes and his wife to build the court house.

Augustine Smith Gaylord, who is the namesake for the town, was an attorney associated with the Michigan Central Railroad. His law firm was located in Saginaw. Gaylord never lived in his namesake town, but he did own property in Hayes Township. His distinguished career included serving as a school teacher, church choir director, county clerk, and member of the State Legislature, Gaylord was appointed to serve as an attorney for the Department of the Interior in 1875.

Gaylord became the county seat of Otsego County. Prior to 1877, Otsego Lake Village had been designated as the temporary county seat. Gaylord&#x27;s central location in the county, along with its growing business community, prompted the change. In the same year, the namesake of the town, Augustine Smith Gaylord died at his home in Saginaw at the age of 46. It is believed that a trip to negotiate a treaty with Native American tribes out west in Montana and The Dakotas, at the request of President Ulysses S. Grant was possibly too strenuous for his pre-existing health conditions at the time, which declined his health, which prevented him from returning to Washington.

In 1879, the state legislature appropriated state-owned lands to be exchanged for construction of a state road from Petoskey through Berryville to Gaylord. These lands were originally conveyed to the State of Michigan by the Federal government in 1850 by the Swamp Land Act of 1850.

Gaylord was officially incorporated as a village in 1881, with the first council meeting being held in March of the same year which was presided by Chester C. Mitchell.

=== 20th century history ===

During the early 20th century, many fires and epidemics swept through the town.

In 1905, a marketing campaign was undertaken to attract outside business investors and new residents to locate in Gaylord. A 38-page photo booklet entitled “Gaylord Illustrated” was published to showcase the many benefits of living in the town. Among the many photographs featured in the booklet were the Otsego County Courthouse and the Dayton Last Block Works. The Dayton Last Block Works was located south and west of downtown Gaylord between the Michigan Central Railroad and U.S. 27. It was bordered on the south by Wisconsin Avenue, and to the north by Third Street. The 14-acre industrial site included 27 buildings, and the owners claimed it to be the largest factory of its kind in world. The company, headquartered in Dayton, Ohio, operated its Gaylord branch from 1895 to 1931.

Otsego County hardwoods were used to produce wooden shoe forms, bowling pins, and golf club heads. One of the original brick buildings still stands on South Otsego Avenue as the Bavarian Office complex.

A second railroad, the Boyne City, Gaylord and Alpena (BC,G&amp;A), reached Gaylord in 1906. This provided east–west rail travel and transportation. The tracks entered Gaylord from Hallock from the northeast. The BC,G&amp;A shared the Michigan Central Railroad depot on Michigan Avenue. Heading east, the tracks paralleled Fourth Street and headed toward the town of Sparr.

Another important manufacturing venture in Gaylord&#x27;s past was the Gaylord Motor Car Company. Formed in 1910 by local investors who had dreams of becoming the next Detroit, the company offered four innovative styles designed to compete with other automakers. Approximately 350 cars were produced before the company went bankrupt in 1913. The only known Gaylord car still around was a Gaylord 30 restored by Ivan Polus, a resident of Whitefish, Montana, which was then purchased by the Gaylord 30 Car Committee, who bought it for $20,000, the restored car is on display at the Chamber of Commerce in downtown Gaylord.

In 1921, roads were officially paved downtown Gaylord became a city in 1922. The change from village to city required a vote by town residents. The residents voted in favor 114 to 93, a 21-vote margin. John Hamilton was elected the first mayor of Gaylord. A sewage system was installed in the late 1930s or early 1940s.

Throughout the 20th century Gaylord grew, with summer tourism, winter sports including downhill and cross-country skiing and snowmobiling. In December 1970, a Roman Catholic Diocese was created by Pope Paul VI, and erected it on July 20, 1971, with Edmund Szoka becoming the first bishop of the diocese, and named St. Mary, Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral as the cathedral for the diocese, the current bishop is Jeffrey Walsh.

===Modern history===
In 2002, Bishop Patrick R. Cooney allowed Gerald Shirilla to serve as pastor of a church with a school, having known that Shirilla had been removed from the Archdiocese of Detroit in 1993 following decades-long allegations of sexual abuse, After the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reported on the situation in 2003, Cooney said that Shirilla had made &quot;some errors in judgment&quot; but was &quot;no threat to the well-being of our children,&quot; but suspended him two weeks later.

The Edelweiss Village Shopping Center opened in 2004 on Dickerson Road.

On May 20, 2022, an EF3 tornado with winds of struck the city killing two people and injuring 44. There was major damage to several businesses and a mobile home park. Incumbent Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for the Gaylord area and stated that Lansing will provide reconstruction to Gaylord. This tornado was the first to hit the city since records began in 1950.

In 2023, Gaylord&#x27;s high school softball team won their first state championship, defeating Vicksburg 8–3, the team set a MHSAA home run record (72) in their championship season, the team would repeat as champions again in 2024, defeating Vicksburg 3–2.

The Western Michigan region has been inhabited by the Ottawa Native Americans for centuries. It is from this tribe that the county takes its name.

The first European explorers in the Ottawa County region were the French-Canadian explorers Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette, who passed through the region in the mid 17th century.

European settlement in the area proceeded slowly until the mid 19th century, when zinc was discovered in Crockery Creek in 1858. (Barnes, 1997) In 1872, the town of Nunica was officially incorporated, the name taken from the Ottawa word for zinc. The 1880 census showed approximately 1,000 settlers in the region.

<text>Fallon is a city in Churchill County in the U.S. state of Nevada. The population was 9,327 at time of the 2020 census. Fallon is the county seat of Churchill County and is located in the Lahontan Valley. Fallon is known for being home to Naval Air Station Fallon, located southeast of town.

==History==
The community was first populated during the California Gold Rush, because multiple would-be Forty-niners stopped after crossing the Carson River.

The town and post office were established on July 24, 1896, in a little shack belonging to Michael Fallon and Eliza Fallon, who operated a ranch at the site. Shortly afterwards, Jim Richards later operated a store near the post office.

The town was officially incorporated in 1908.

Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental thoroughfare, passes through Fallon from east to west, following the original Pony Express trail. Today it is designated U.S. Highway 50, and eastward from Fallon is popularly known as &quot;The Loneliest Road in America,&quot; as it passes through only two towns and one small city between Fallon and the Utah state line, over 400 miles distant. 

When U.S. Highway 95 (stretching between the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico) was laid out in the 1930s, the highway north of town met Highway 50 at the northern end of what was then the town center (Maine Street). To avoid forcing traffic through town, there is a four-block &quot;dogleg&quot; on Highway 50 separating the north and south legs of Highway 95. 

While the city has expanded greatly over the years, the &quot;old town&quot; area is several blocks of Maine Street. Many of the buildings here date back to the early 20th century, including the historic Fallon Theater, which is still in operation as of 2023.

Naval Air Station Fallon, built in 1942, is southeast of the city center. Since 1996, NAS Fallon has been home to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Navy Fighter Weapons School (popularly known as TOPGUN), using several flight training areas and practice ranges in the area. 

On June 16, 2019, downtown (Maine Street) Fallon was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Fallon is located in western Churchill County at the geographic coordinates (39.472792, −118.778826). It is in the Lahontan Valley, a former lakebed into which flows the Carson River, which passes north of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Fallon has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.49%, is water.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 7,536 people, 3,004 households, and 1,877 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,336 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 76.5% White, 2.0% African American, 3.0% Native American, 4.7% Asian, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 0.3% from other races, and 3.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 9.9% of the population.

There were 3,004 households, out of which 35.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 42.7% were married couples living together, 15.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.5% were non-families. 30.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.06.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 28.4% under the age of 18, 10.3% from 18 to 24, 29.7% from 25 to 44, 19.4% from 45 to 64, and 12.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $35,935, and the median income for a family was $41,433. Males had a median income of $35,356 versus $22,818 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,919. About 9.5% of families and 12.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.6% of those under age 18 and 10.3% of those age 65 or over.

Between 1997 and 2003, the Fallon community experienced an unusually high incidence of childhood leukemia. In response, the U.S. Senate held the Field Hearing Before the Committee on Environment and Public Works during the winter of 2001. Nevada Assemblywoman Merle A. Berman was a participant. According to the minutes of that hearing, on February 14, Berman pressed for answers to ascertain why certain individuals, but not others were selected for the panel of experts chosen to investigate the leukemia clusters and &quot;why the Federal Government was not involved in the testing.&quot; And on April 12, Berman obtained this testimony from one of the medical experts in attendance:

[Dr. Thomas Sinks, the associate director for science at the National Center for Environmental Health at the Centers for Disease Control] clarified that nobody ever developed cancer because of chances. There was always a cause, and the challenge in Fallon would be to discover the common denominator among the 11 children. The unifying cause was not yet known, but eventually science would identify the commonality. The probability of the Fallon cluster being a chance event was described by Dr. Sinks as being unlikely.

In 2011, epidemiologists at the University of California, Berkeley theorized that the &quot;space-time patterning&quot; of the leukemia cluster was &quot;consistent with the involvement of an infectious disease,&quot; and that a &quot;possible mode of transmission&quot; was &quot;by means of a vector&quot; since mosquitoes were &quot;abundant in Churchill County outside of the urban area of Fallon.&quot;

==Education==
The city is served by the Churchill County School District. Churchill County High School is the main high school and also caters to students in rural areas outside the city. Western Nevada College has a campus in Fallon.

There is a charter school, Oasis Academy.

Fallon has a public library, the Churchill County Library.

== Climate ==
Fallon experiences a cold desert climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Due to Fallon&#x27;s elevation and aridity, the diurnal temperature variation is quite substantial, especially in the summer months. Fallon&#x27;s climate is quite dry, due to its location in the Rain Shadow of the Sierra Nevada. Summer days can be hot, but temperatures are cooler than in deserts such as the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts, due to Fallon&#x27;s altitude and higher latitude north of the equator. In the winter, daytime temperatures are usually above freezing, but nights can be bitterly cold. Fallon can experience heavy fog in winter, known as pogonip.

==Nuclear weapons testing==
Los Alamos National Laboratory, in conjunction with the Department of Defense, conducted an underground nuclear test southeast of Fallon at 5 p.m. on October 26, 1963. Named Project Shoal, the 12.5-kiloton detonation was part of the Vela Uniform program. The device exploded at a depth of below ground surface. The site is located in Gote Flat in the Sand Springs Range.

Access to the Project Shoal Area is unrestricted. Access to the area is by Highway 50, Nevada Highway 839, then to an improved gravel road to the site.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Go-Getter&quot;, starring Zooey Deschanel and Jena Malone, mentions Fallon many times and even brings up Fallon&#x27;s annual Heart &#x27;O Gold Cantaloupe Festival. Malone&#x27;s character lives in Fallon, and parts of the movie were filmed in and around Fallon.

==Notable people==
* John C. Carpenter, rancher, businessman, and politician, was born in Fallon.
* Harvey Dahl, St. Louis Rams a former offensive lineman, was born in Fallon.
* Luella Kirkbride Drumm, former member of the Nevada Assembly
* Wuzzie George, Northern Paiute craftswoman and recorder of indigenous lifeways
* Martin Heinrich, U.S. Senator from New Mexico since 2013, born in Fallon but raised in Columbia, Missouri.

<text>Blue Diamond is a census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Nevada, United States. The population was 268 at the 2020 census.

==Description==
The community includes a park, private pool, library, elementary school, event hall, church, and mercantile / gas station. The mercantile (general store) was built in 1942 and originally sold household staples and sundries to residents who were mostly miners at the Blue Diamond Mine. The store has maintained its original external look. Walls inside the store showcase many of the town&#x27;s historical photos, courtesy of the Blue Diamond Historical Society, a 501c3 all-volunteer organization.

==History==
Blue Diamond is the site of Cottonwood Spring (formerly known as Ojo de Cayetana, or Pearl Spring), a watering place and camp site on the Old Spanish Trail and the later Mormon Road between Mountain Springs and Las Vegas Springs. The springs are located on a mountainside south of the town at at an elevation of 3409 feet.

The nearby gypsum mine was purchased in 1923 by the Blue Diamond Corporation of California. The company opened a wallboard manufacturing plant at the site in 1941, and then began building a company town in 1942. The village of Cottonwood became known as Blue Diamondville that year, when a post office opened under that name. The name was changed to Blue Diamond later in the year, although some authorities continued to refer to it as Blue Diamondville until at least 1950.

<text>Boulder City is a city in Clark County, Nevada, United States. It is approximately southeast of Las Vegas. As of the 2020 census, the population of Boulder City was 14,885. The city took its name from Boulder Canyon. Boulder City is one of only two places in Nevada that prohibits gambling, the other being the town of Panaca.

==History==
===Beginnings as federal company town===
The land upon which Boulder City was founded was a harsh, desert environment. Its sole reason for existence was the need to house workers contracted to build the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River (known commonly as Boulder Dam from 1933 to 1947, when it was officially renamed Hoover Dam by a joint resolution of Congress). Men hoping for work on the dam project had begun settling along the river in tents soon after the precise site for the dam had been chosen by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1930. Their ramshackle edifices were collectively known as &quot;Ragtown&quot;.
Boulder City was originally built in 1931 by the Bureau of Reclamation and Six Companies, Inc. as housing for workers who were building the Hoover Dam.

The sheer scale of the dam and duration of the project required the Bureau of Reclamation to consider the construction of a semi-permanent town rather than a temporary arrangement. Boulder City was exceptionally rare as an example of a town fully planned under government supervision. This is unlike 19th century privately funded company town examples found in the United Kingdom, such as Port Sunlight, or in the United States, such as Pullman, Chicago.

===Early years: 1930–1934===

Boulder City was carefully planned through federal supervision as a model community, with Dutch-born urban architect Saco Rienk de Boer contracted to plan it. DeBoer had been a planner for Denver, Colorado, and was to design many towns and suburbs around the Rocky Mountain region. Because the Hoover Dam project itself represented a focus for optimism for a country suffering from the effects of the Great Depression, the town itself was to be an additional manifestation of this optimism. There was to be an emphasis on a clean-living environment for dam workers. The plan submitted by DeBoer in 1930 was formal and symmetrical with a park and the Bureau of Reclamation building at the termination of the two main axes. The plan was deemed too expensive to carry out in its original form and was modified to allow for more regular block sizes. Nevertheless, its allowance for public space and copious amounts of landscaping earned it the moniker &quot;Nevada&#x27;s Garden City&quot;. The provision of green landscape was another expression of the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s &quot;mission to reclaim and &#x27;green&#x27; the American West.&quot;

The town was designed to house approximately 5,000 workers. The status of the workers on the Hoover Dam was reflected in their house sizes and locations. The most important employees had their residences on top of the hill nearer the apex. Managers were housed further down the hill, and dwellings for manual laborers were located furthest away from the public buildings and parks. The most radically modified portions of DeBoer&#x27;s plan were in these lower-class residential blocks, where open space and parks were largely eliminated.

Commercial development was restricted and severely regulated under Sims Ely, the city manager. There were limits to the number of different types of stores allowed in the city, and all who wished to begin a business were screened for character and financial viability. On the other hand, there was no provision for schools in the burgeoning city, probably because the Bureau of Reclamation expected that single male workers would populate the town. The town made do with makeshift schoolrooms until the city won the right for state-funded schools to be established on the federal reservation upon which Boulder City was situated. No hospitals were provided in the city either. Injured workers had to travel to Las Vegas Hospital, and when a hospital was established in the city, females were not admitted for a number of years.

===Similarity to earlier company towns===
Like early model company town Port Sunlight, the workers of Boulder City were under strict monitoring: alcohol was prohibited in the town until 1969 and gambling has been prohibited since the city&#x27;s outset. The city was founded during the Prohibition era. Boulder Theatre, established in 1931, meant that workers were not obliged to travel to Las Vegas for amusements. Such measures were common for company towns dating back to the 19th century, since sober workers surrounded by their own gardens and provided with appropriate entertainment would be more productive during their working days.

In the case of Boulder City, the prohibition of alcohol and gambling was at least partly due to the proximity of Las Vegas, which had a notoriously rowdy vice district. Visitors to Boulder City were admitted by permit, and by 1932, there was a gatehouse through which all visitors had to pass.

===Trendsetter for decentralization===
While the establishment of Boulder City occurred while Las Vegas was modest in size with approximately 5,000 inhabitants, it was effectively the beginning of the fragmentation of cities in the region of Clark County. This move to disperse to multiple centers predated the decentralization movement of the 1970s. The nearby city of Henderson, founded in 1943 and based around the magnesium industry, was another early example of decentralization before Clark County had a significant population: &quot;...the region began to decentralize and regroup as a multi-centered area early in its history.&quot; The independent governments of Henderson, North Las Vegas, Las Vegas, and Boulder City have perpetuated the fragmented nature of the region, giving each city its individual character, as well as generally stymieing the outward growth of these cities.

===1960s onwards===
The government did not relinquish control of Boulder City until 1959, when the town was incorporated. Boulder City&#x27;s incorporation ceremony took place on January 4, 1960. The city council selected pharmacist Robert N. Broadbent as the city&#x27;s first mayor.

The city charter, approved by the residents, prohibited gambling within the city limits. This provision still exists, making Boulder City one of only two locations in Nevada where gambling is illegal (the other is the town of Panaca). The Hoover Dam Lodge hotel-casino permits gambling and has a Boulder City mailing address, but it is located on a parcel of private land within the boundaries of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area and thus not within city limits.

Another casino on the other end of town is the Railroad Pass Hotel and Casino, which has a Boulder City telephone prefix, but is within the boundary of the neighboring city of Henderson.

Alcohol sales were first permitted in 1969.

On August 9, 2018, the Boulder City Bypass opened to the public as part of the Interstate 11 project. The bypass is still within Boulder City&#x27;s city limit, but bypasses the populated area. Initially, businesses and the populace were concerned that the bypass would have a negative effect on the local economy, though it seems that the opposite was true for some businesses.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.02%, is water. This ranks Boulder City as the largest city in Nevada by land area and 35th in the country, but gives it a low density rate of only about 72 people per square mile.

Boulder City maintains strict controls on growth, limited to 120 single- or multi-family residential building permits for new construction per year. Hotels are also restricted to no more than 35 rooms. These restrictions are defined in the city code of Boulder City.

==Economy==
===Hoover Dam in marketing===

The proximity of Hoover Dam to Boulder City is reflected in many of the businesses in the historic Downtown district, which is home to the Boulder Dam Hotel, home of the Boulder City/Hoover Dam Museum. (The hotel is named after the dam&#x27;s former name.)

Making a pun on the word &quot;damn&quot; is also popular. The Boulder City Chamber of Commerce has used the slogan &quot;Best City By A Dam Site&quot; in promotions, and the city hosts an annual festival of short subject films dubbed &quot;The Dam Short Film Festival&quot;. Boulder City also hosts a number of Hoover Dam related events such as &quot;That Dam Guy Stole My Dam Car&quot; car race and &quot;Get Off My Dam Lawn&quot; gardening festival.

<text>Enterprise is an unincorporated town in the Las Vegas Valley in Clark County, Nevada, United States. The population was 221,831 at the 2020 U.S. census, up from 14,676 at the 2000 census. It was founded on December 17, 1996. Like other unincorporated towns in the Las Vegas Valley, it was assigned Las Vegas ZIP Codes for addressing.

==History==
The first inhabitants were the Paiute Indians, who were spread across the Las Vegas Valley. In 1905, the railroad town of Arden was formed for miners who worked at the nearby gypsum mines just west of the area. The area was part of Lincoln County until 1909, when Clark County was split off from Lincoln County. The oldest structure in the area is a water tower, which was built in 1926.

References to the area as &quot;Enterprise&quot; date back to at least 1918, when county commissioners established an Enterprise school district. According to one historian, the word may simply have been chosen at that time as a positive-sounding name.

On April 21, 1958, United Airlines Flight 736 and an Air Force jet collided into each other, causing 49 fatalities. The airliner crash site in 1958 was empty desert scrubland, but today commercial development near the intersection of South Decatur Boulevard and West Cactus Avenue, adjacent to the community of Southern Highlands, has encroached on the site. In 1999 a small metal cross was put up by the son of a victim as a memorial to the lives lost.

Enterprise was formed as an unincorporated town on December 17, 1996, in response to a petition from residents who hoped it would help preserve the community&#x27;s semi-rural identity. This was made to prevent annexation by nearby Henderson. Immediately afterwards, Clark County commissioners voted to annex about five square miles of land into neighboring Spring Valley that included the master-planned community of Rhodes Ranch and a regional park. The annexation plan was developed by commissioner Erin Kenny. The vote was almost unanimous, with the sole exception of Bruce L. Woodbury voting against annexation. The chairwoman of the county commission, Yvonne Atkinson Gates, was against the annexation, but voted for annexation anyway because she wanted to recall the situation after the next advisory board meeting in January 1997. Residents, both governmental and non-governmental, opposed the annexation because they had no say in the vote.

On January 19, 1999, an interlocal agreement was approved by the Clark County Commission and the Henderson City Council to annex about 5,000 to 6,000 acres of land into the City of Henderson, with most of the land belonging to the Bureau of Land Management southwest of the master-planned community of Anthem, but also including 1,400 acres that were part of Enterprise. The city wanted to annex land so it could have an exit on Interstate 15 (specifically the Sloan exit ), and so they could maintain Lake Mead Drive (now St. Rose Parkway). Residents of Enterprise did not approve of the annexation plan because they wanted to preserve their rural lifestyle. County commissioners told some residents that the county could not stop Henderson from annexing a piece of their town, and said that the interlocal agreement was the best they could do. This agreement stopped Henderson from annexing section 33 (which was a heavily populated section of Enterprise), and instead annex sections 26 and 34, which were, at the time, undeveloped.

Not long after the founding of Enterprise, population and development have seen a rapid growth, similar to many other communities in unincorporated Clark County. From 2000 to 2010, the population boosted from 14,108 residents to 108,481 in 2010, the number would more than double to 221,831 in 2020.

This village was originally a lumberjack settlement on the shore of Lake Huron named &quot;Bark Shanty.&quot; In the late 1840s and 1850s, the settlement gained its first sawmill, schoolhouse, and general store. In 1854, Bark Shanty&#x27;s first post office opened. In 1857 the village was renamed to Port Sanilac, as it is in Sanilac Township in Sanilac County. Local legend attributes the name to a Wyandotte Indian Chief named Sanilac. See List of Michigan county name etymologies.

Local landmarks include the Port Sanilac lighthouse (burning kerosene from its opening in 1886 until its electrification in 1924) and a twenty-room Victorian mansion (now the Sanilac County Museum) built in 1872 by a horse-and-buggy doctor, Dr. Joseph Loop.

<doc id="124363" wikidata="Q2283257" url="?curid=124363" title="Goodsprings, Nevada">
<text>Goodsprings is an unincorporated community in Clark County, Nevada, United States. The Pioneer Saloon and the Goodsprings School house were both built in 1913 and are still in use to this day. The town was once a prosperous mining town before seeing a significant decline in the population. The population was 229 as of the 2010 census. Due to this, Goodsprings has been characterized as a ghost town.

==History==

The town was named for cattle rancher Joseph Good, whose cattle frequented a spring nestled in the southeastern foothills of the Spring Mountains. Mormon miners discovered lead at Potosi Mountain in 1856. Gold was first discovered in the region in 1893. Goodsprings was once the heart of the most productive mining districts in Clark County. Over the years, lead, silver, copper, zinc and gold have all been mined from this area.

Before 1900, a small cluster of tent cabins and a mill were erected, and a post office. Lincoln County established Goodsprings Township. In 1904, Salt Lake City mining interests platted the Goodsprings Township. Most early buildings in the town were constructed during the boom spurred by the railroad in 1910–1911.

After a number of moves, the current Goodsprings Schoolhouse was erected in 1913. Now on the National Register of Historic Places, it is the oldest school in Clark County that was built as a school and is still used as a school. In 2009 citing costs, the school was nearly shut down. By 2016, the school had only around 10 students.

The town boasted a population of 800 by 1918. Lead mining increased during World War 1 to produce ammunition. However, after World War I, mining slowed and families moved away. World War II created a second boom, but it too slowed after the war ended. The town&#x27;s population has dwindled to approximately 200.

During the 1950s, atomic testing took place in the area.

Many of the buildings that were once built no longer are standing in Goodsprings. A major cause were the several fires destroyed buildings in the city, including a 1966 fire which destroyed the local Fayle Hotel. The Goodsprings Historical Society has attempted to preserve and restore local buildings by making repairs to the roofs.

== Pioneer Saloon ==

Goodsprings is the home of the Pioneer Saloon, which opened in 1913 and is considered to be one of the oldest saloons in Nevada. The walls of the saloon are made out of pressed tin. On June 27, 1915 a dispute over a card game between Paul Coski and miner Joe Armstrong resulted in Armstrong firing twice at Coski, killing him. Armstrong was initially exonerated of wrong doing by coroner&#x27;s jury on the basis of self-defense. He was subsequently put on trial and found not-guilty according to &quot;Reno Gazette-Journal&quot; on the basis that &quot;he had never been a quarrelsome man, and had a splendid record&quot;. The contemporary saloon showcases two holes in the wall that it says were bullet holes from the shooting with a local newspaper article explaining the case.

The Pioneer Saloon and several other locations around Las Vegas were raided in 1924 by regulatory officers in violation of prohibition banning the sale of alcohol.

In addition, the Pioneer Saloon has a small memorial to Carole Lombard and her husband Clark Gable. Lombard&#x27;s plane TWA Flight 3 crashed into nearby Potosi Mountain on January 16, 1942, resulting in the death of all 22 people on board, including Lombard&#x27;s mother and press agent. The saloon and hotel were the centers of operations for the search in the aftermath of the accident.

A new owner purchased the saloon in 2006, and put around 2 million dollars renovating the building. The Pioneer Saloon was purchased in 2021 for 1.5 million dollars after the previous owner had owned it for 15 years.

The saloon has also been used as a filming location for film productions such as &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, and &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot; as well as the reality television series &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;. This saloon appeared in several films and TV series, such as &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;The Misfits&quot;, and &quot;Cherry 2000&quot;. The town also features prominently in the 2010 video game &quot;&quot;. The saloon, which is re-created accurately in the videogame, has a small corner dedicated to the game. Since 2022, the saloon has hosted a yearly festival, drawing thousands of Fallout fans from around the world to Goodsprings.

== Energy production ==
The Goodsprings Waste Heat Recovery Station opened in 2010, providing 7.5MW of energy from waste heat produced at a Kern River Pipeline compressor station. The plant is owned and operated by NV Energy and is the first renewable energy plant owned by the company. The plant which cost $22 million was constructed by Ormat Technologies construction began in March 2010 and began operations in November of that year.

<text>Henderson is a city in Clark County, Nevada, United States, about southeast of downtown Las Vegas. It is the 2nd most populous city in Nevada, after Las Vegas, with 317,610 residents. The city is part of the Las Vegas Valley.

Henderson is notable for its extensive system of outdoor recreation facilities, including over 220 miles (354 km) of trails and 72 parks.

Incorporated in 1953, Henderson was originally known for its role in magnesium production during World War II. Since then, it has grown rapidly through the development of master planned communities starting with the large Green Valley neighborhood, redevelopment and reinvestment after the PEPCON Disaster, and the city government&#x27;s historically proactive planning and management.

== History ==

The township of Henderson first emerged in the 1940s during World War II with the building of the Basic Magnesium Plant. Henderson quickly became the main supplier of magnesium in the United States, which was called the &quot;miracle metal&quot; of World War II. The plant supplied the US War Department with magnesium for incendiary munition casings and airplane engines, frames, and other parts. A quarter of all US wartime magnesium came from the Henderson Plant to strengthen aluminum, using 25% of Hoover Dam&#x27;s power to separate the metal from its ore by electrolysis.

Although &quot;born in America&#x27;s defense&quot;, Henderson&#x27;s future after World War II was uncertain. In 1947, magnesium production was no longer necessary for defense, and most of the Black Mountain Industrial (BMI) Complex&#x27;s 14,000 employees moved away. Enrollment in the school system was reduced by two thirds, and well over half the townsite houses, built to house plant workers, became vacant. In 1947, the United States War Asset Administration offered Henderson for sale as war surplus property.

With the help of local industry, Henderson was incorporated on April 16, 1953, as the City of Henderson. On May 23, 1953, Henderson, with its population of 7,410, elected Dr. Jim French as the first mayor. Originally only about in size, the city quickly began to grow, reaching over in size in 2022.

=== Ammonium perchlorate factory fire ===

On May 4, 1988, the Pacific Engineering and Production Company of Nevada (PEPCON) chemical plant experienced a catastrophic fire and series of explosions. The facility was one of only two in the United States producing ammonium perchlorate, a key component in solid rocket fuel.

The disaster resulted in two fatalities, injured over 300 individuals, and caused extensive damage throughout the Las Vegas Valley. The explosions were so powerful that they registered seismic activity equivalent to a 3.5 magnitude earthquake and were felt up to 10 miles away.

The incident led to significant changes in industrial safety regulations and emergency response protocols in the region. In the aftermath, PEPCON ceased operations in Henderson, and the site was eventually redeveloped for commercial use.

<doc id="124365" wikidata="Q938100" url="?curid=124365" title="Indian Springs, Nevada">
<text>Indian Springs is an unincorporated town and a census-designated place located on U.S. Route 95 next to Creech Air Force Base in northwestern Clark County and southern Nevada.

The population was 991 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The community was named for the fact that Native Americans had settled on the springs near the original town site.

In 1906, Indian Springs became a way station and watering place for the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad. The original rail line ran under what is now US 95. The LV&amp;T ceased operation in 1918.

===Army Air Forces to Air Force Base===
Indian Springs Auxiliary Airfield also known as Indian Springs Field, was rapidly constructed in Nevada by the United States Army Air Forces the month after the Pearl Harbor attack. Indian Springs was immediately entered into service as a training camp for Army Air Force B-25 air-to-air gunnery training, and as a divert field for Las Vegas Army Airfield.

In 1947, Las Vegas AAF was inactivated, and so was Indian Springs.

One year later, Indian Springs was reactivated as Indian Springs Air Force Base by the new United States Air Force, with a new role as a new weapons systems and aircraft research and testing. Among these missions were support for nuclear arms testing at the Nevada Proving Grounds, high-altitude balloon search and retrieval, new gunnery and rocketry systems, and testing of experimental aircraft. For a period of the 1950s and 1960s Indian Springs AFB housed some of the most advanced aircraft and air weapons systems in the world.

In the 1960s, Indian Springs AFB was transferred to the Tactical Air Wing and re-designated as Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field. The Indian Springs mission was focused on monitoring of Nellis range, and became the remote training site of the USAF Thunderbirds elite air demonstration squadron. The 1982 &quot;Diamond Crash&quot; caused the deaths of four Thunderbird pilots and hastened their transition from the T-38A Talon to the F-16C Fighting Falcon.

====Creech Air Force Base====

Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field was renamed Creech Air Force Base in 2005, in honor of General Wilbur L. &quot;Bill&quot; Creech, a former commander of the Tactical Air Command. Also in the 2000s, Creech AFB began to host the 432d Wing and 432d Air Expeditionary Wing, operating/flying unmanned aerial vehicles, and returning the base to its history as a base of advanced special aircraft development.

The base also hosts the operations of the 556th Test and Evaluation Squadron and 99th Ground Combat Training Squadron, The National Desert Warfare Center, and those of the Air Force Reserve&#x27;s 78th Reconnaissance Squadron, 91st RS, and Nevada Air National Guard&#x27;s 232nd Operations Squadron.

===&quot;Wild Bill&quot; Williams===
George and Belle Lattimer owned a ranch where the Indian Springs Hotel &amp; Casino was located until October 1, 2014 when it was closed by the USAF to expand a security buffer around Creech AFB. In 1906, George Lattimer was bitten by an insect, or perhaps a brown recluse spider, and Belle hitched the wagon to take him into the doctor. A 16-year-old Paiute Indian boy named Coachie Siegmuller was left to watch the ranch.

While they were gone, Siegmuller saw another Paiute named Bill &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Williams approached the ranch. Williams was known as &quot;bad&quot; and Siegmuller was terrified of him. Williams was notorious for exploiting young Paiute men by hiring them out to local ranchers and then pocketing their wages. Williams was there that day to collect some of these wages. Finding no one home, Williams stretched out on the porch and was soon fast asleep. Siegmuller felt he needed to defend the ranch, fetched a rifle from the kitchen, silently crept up on Williams, and shot him dead in the head.

Coachie Siegmuller pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to death. The area&#x27;s Paiute Reservation, the Las Vegas Indian Colony, threatened to go to war over the death penalty, and to keep the peace Siegmuller was instead sentenced to three years in the Carson City Prison. The Lattimers buried Wild Bill Williams behind the ranch. Dogs kept digging his remains up, so they were buried a few times before staying under.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,302 people, 526 households, and 341 families residing in the census designated place (CDP). The population density was . There were 657 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 88.02% White, 1.15% African American, 2.00% Native American, 1.15% Asian, 0.84% Pacific Islander, 4.22% from other races, and 2.61% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.84% of the population.

There were 526 households, out of which 32.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.3% were married couples living together, 13.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.0% were non-families. 30.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48 and the average family size was 3.05.

In the CDP the population was spread out, with 29.0% under the age of 18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 23.4% from 25 to 44, 28.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 105.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 108.3 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $40,966, and the median income for a family was $40,608. Males had a median income of $35,609 versus $24,286 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $14,687. About 7.2% of families and 10.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.2% of those under age 18 and 13.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==
Indian Springs has a public library, a branch of the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District.

==Climate==
Indian Springs experiences a desert climate, typical of southern Nevada. Precipitation is rare throughout the year, and summers are hot, although very low humidity helps temper the effects of the heat. Indian Springs&#x27; climate is similar to that of nearby Las Vegas, but with some significant differences. Nighttime temperatures at Indian Springs are much cooler than those in Las Vegas. This is due both to Indian Springs&#x27; higher elevation, and the lack of the Urban heat island effect that prevents temperatures in Las Vegas from falling quickly after dark.

In 1876, it was renamed to describe its location on Anchor Bay. A post office was established in December 1885.
*Copeland Corner is on M-29 at Perch Road ( Elevation: ).
*Fair Haven is about a mile and a half east-southeast of Anchorville on M-29 at . The Fairhaven ZIP code 48023 serves most of Ira Township. The community was the site of a French-speaking Metis settlement dating from before 1837 and named after the nearby stream, &quot;Rivière des Cygnes&quot;. This was translated by American settlers as Swan Creek and was given a post office with that name in October 1857. In February 1862, it was renamed Fair Haven.

<text>Laughlin () is an unincorporated community in Clark County, Nevada, United States. Laughlin lies south of Las Vegas, in the far southern tip of Nevada. As a resort town, it is known for its gaming and water recreation. As of the 2020 census, the population was 8,658. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Laughlin as a census-designated place (CDP). It is located on the Colorado River, downstream from the Davis Dam and Lake Mohave, and directly across from the much larger Bullhead City, Arizona. The nearby communities of Bullhead City, Arizona; Needles, California; Fort Mohave, Arizona; and Mohave Valley, Arizona, bring the area&#x27;s total population to about 100,000. Laughlin is also northeast of Los Angeles.

Laughlin was named for Don Laughlin, an Owatonna, Minnesota native, who purchased the southern tip of Nevada in 1964 (informally called South Pointe). At the time, Don Laughlin operated the 101 Club in Las Vegas. He opened what would become the Riverside Resort, and later wanted to call the community Riverside or Casino, but the post office opted for Laughlin instead.

==History==

The townsite of Laughlin was established in the 1940s as &quot;South Pointe&quot; because of the proximity to the southern tip of the state of Nevada. The early town consisted of a motel and bar that catered to gold and silver miners, construction workers building Davis Dam, and fishing enthusiasts. In the 1950s, construction workers left, and the town functionally disappeared.

In 1964, Don Laughlin, owner of the 101 Club in Las Vegas, flew over the site and saw its tourism potential. He offered to buy the land, and within a few years, the Riverside Resort motel and casino, consisting of only 12 slots and two live tables, begun operating. A second casino, the Bobcat Club, opened in 1967, where the Golden Nugget Laughlin currently operates. In 1968, a third casino, the Monte Carlo, opened its doors. The neighboring Bullhead City, Arizona was a key part in Laughlin&#x27;s growth, with shuttle boats transported customers from the Arizona side of the river to Laughlin&#x27;s resorts and back. The southernmost tip of Nevada, along the Colorado River, where Nevada, California, and Arizona meet, was a major national tourist destination and gambling resort during the 70s, 80s &amp; 90s.

In the 1980s, Laughlin was developed with the construction of several more hotels and casinos. The Colorado Hotel (now the Pioneer), The Regency, Sam&#x27;s Town Gold River (now the Laughlin River Lodge), and The Edgewater opened in the early 1980s. Other investors saw the growth as an opportunity to get in on the action. A second boom resulted in the construction of The Colorado Belle, Harrah&#x27;s Del Rio, and The Ramada Express (now The Tropicana Express). In 1987, Don Laughlin funded and built the Laughlin Bridge at a cost of $3.5 million, which connected Laughlin to Bullhead City by land directly. He donated the bridge to the states of Nevada and Arizona. The bridge carries 30,000 vehicles daily. In 1988, a megaresort project called Emerald River was announced. The $800 million project would have included four hotel-casinos, but construction was halted in 1990 due to financing problems, leaving two unfinished towers. A golf course was the only aspect of Emerald River to be completed, operating from 1990 until 2005. The Flamingo Hilton, now known as The Aquarius, was built in 1990.

The Mohave Power Station opened in 1971, and closed down on December 31, 2005.

===Incorporation attempts===
In 2012, some residents disapproving of Clark County politics made a push to incorporate Laughlin as a city in order stave off additional loss business opportunities, as well as gain local control. The proposal did not include Laughlin Casinos. When the proposal came to a vote in a referendum, the vote was 57 percent opposed to 43 percent in favor.

In 2019, Senate Bill 213 failed to pass the Nevada legislature&#x27;s Committee of Government Affairs, which would have made Laughlin a city without the consent of the voters. This would have given Laughlin representation on 9 of the 15 entities now providing services to the community

In 2021, Senate Bill 79 was introduced to allow for an election for incorporation in 2022. The Bill was sent to the Committee of Government Affairs where it failed to pass. Some local residents of the community also expressed concern that incorporation would make Laughlin unaffordable for senior citizens during the covid-19 pandemic. Others viewed it as an excuse to &quot;raid&quot; the Ft. Mohave Development Fund Senator Hardy, explained to community members in the March 9, 2021, meeting that the reason he introduced the bill was to provide better public safety services to a growing Laughlin. Currently, there are memorandums of understanding with Bullhead City, for fire protection in Laughlin

Mesquite, like nearby Bunkerville, had its origins in farming. The Peppermill Mesquite casino, which opened in the 1970s, drove Mesquite&#x27;s diversified economy. The city incorporated in 1984 and established a master development plan during the early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, more casinos opened. By 2006, Mesquite was one of the fastest-growing small towns in the United States, though the late-2000s recession led to the closure of the Oasis (formerly the Peppermill) casino.

==Education==
The city of Mesquite is a part of the Clark County School District. There are four public schools in the valley.
Mesquite has a public library, a branch of the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District.

== Climate ==
Located within the Mojave Desert, Mesquite experiences a desert climate with a large degree of diurnal temperature variation. Roughly 500 ft lower than Las Vegas, Mesquite is typically about 3 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than Las Vegas during the day. Unlike Las Vegas, Mesquite lacks an urban heat island. This makes low temperatures noticeably more comfortable in the summer, but means winter nights are colder.

Like other weather stations in the Mojave and Sonoran desert, the annual temperature cycle is asymmetric, with a seasonal lag of roughly 1 month in summer, and a seasonal lead in winter. The hottest time of the year on average is July 21, with an average high of 106 and low of 72. Conversely, the normal high temp drops to the lowest value of the year, 57 degrees, and low of 28 on December 16, approximately 6 days before the winter solstice. This seasonal lag in summer and seasonal lead in winter can be found in other climate stations in the same region.

==Media==

In 1987, the Virgin Valley&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Desert Echo&quot;, began distribution out of a local home on Riverside Road. &quot;The Desert Valley Times&quot; emerged by 1995, and &quot;The Desert Echo&quot; merged with &quot;The Desert Valley Times&quot; in 1998. Around 2000/2001, St. George–based &quot;The Spectrum&quot; (a Gannett newspaper) bought and distributed &quot;The Desert Valley Times&quot;. Moapa Valley based &quot;Mesa Valley Progress&quot; covers Virgin Valley and Moapa Valley news.

==Economy==

Mesquite is home to several casinos, including the Virgin River Casino, CasaBlanca, Eureka, and Stateline Casino and Motel. The city also includes Rising Star Sports Ranch, a non-gaming hotel and sports facility. The Virgin Valley Heritage Museum has exhibits about area pioneers and local history. The museum building, built in 1940, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Mesquite is a stopping point for those traveling along I-15 between Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. Mesquite is also a destination for year-round golf, with over nine public courses in the warm desert climate, it draws golfers from all over. Mesquite Airport provides facilities for general aviation and skydiving. It previously hosted the annual RE/MAX World Long Drive Championship until 2015.

==History==

===Native American===

The Moapa Valley was originally settled around 350 B.C. by the Ancestral Puebloan people (who used to be called Anasazi by early archeologists). Around 500 A.D., farming supplanted hunting as the major food source for the people known as &quot;Basketmakers&quot;. It was also around this time that the art of pottery was introduced. By 600 A.D., Ancestral Puebloan people began building their dwellings above ground, using wood and brush plastered with adobe. Farming was a well-established practice with corn, beans, squash, and cotton being the primary crops. The Puebloans also hunted mule deer, desert bighorn sheep, rabbits, and rodents using bows and arrows.

Around 1000 A.D. Southern Paiutes moved into the Moapa Valley area. The Paiutes were hunter-gatherers who did not utilize agriculture as a primary source of subsistence. They lived in temporary brush dwellings, spoke the Southern Paiute language, and practiced a style of pottery that was less sophisticated than the methods used by the Anasazi. The Paiutes and Anasazi people coexisted with little effort in the valley.

Sometime around 1150 A.D., the Anasazi abandoned Moapa Valley, possibly due to a drought which gripped the Desert Southwest during that time. When the first European (Mormon) settlers arrived, the Paiutes self relocated (banded together) to a reservation north of Moapa Town, where they continue to live today.

===Settlers===

The first Euroamerican settlers in the Moapa Valley were Mormon pioneers in the latter 1860s. The area has remained heavily populated by Mormons to the present time. Many streets bear the names of prominent Mormon families, including Barlow, Hinckley, Leavitt, Lyman, Perkins, Whitmore, Wells, and Andersen. The LDS Logandale Stake has thirteen wards. The Huntsmans, a well known pioneer family of Moapa Valley, established the Huntsman Ranch, which the cabin still remains today near Kane Springs. It is a State of Nevada designated historical site.

===Modern times===
In 1980, residents of Overton and Logandale approved a referendum on merging the two towns into the town of Moapa Valley. The Clark County Commission affirmed the vote, legally creating Moapa Valley on February 13, 1981. The town had a population of about 1,400 people at the time.

==Radio stations==
There are four radio stations licensed to Moapa Valley. KRRN 92.7 has a Spanish format. KXLI 94.5 has a dance format mainly targeted to Las Vegas. KJUL 104.7 has a &quot;middle-of-the road&quot; (MOR) format. KQLL has a simulcast of Henderson&#x27;s 1280 AM on 102.3 FM, which is an oldies music format.

==History==
===Charleston Park===
According to historian Stanley W. Paher, Conrad Keil (a.k.a. Kyle) built a sawmill and cabin in Kyle Canyon circa 1870–1880. It is shown on a 1881 plat map as being across from Fletcher Canyon, where the historic US Forest Service Administrative Site is located. A 1929 plat map shows that area was serviced by a water pipeline from Fletcher Spring. The Civilian Conservation Corps Camp Charleston Mountain was based there beginning in 1933. According to NVCRIS archaeological records in the Nevada State Historical Preservation Office, another pipeline originating from Fletcher Spring was run to three water tanks on present day Mt. Charleston Church property, which serviced the 1950s-1980s era Young Ranch. The historic Young Ranch property is presently the Retreat on Charleston Peak and Spring Mountains Visitor Gateway.

Edmund W. Griffith initially established a campground in Kyle Canyon around 1905, concurrent with establishment of the Tule Station on the Las Vegas &amp; Tonopah Railroad. His development, shown on the 1929 plat map to be in the present day Old Town Subdivision, was named Charleston Park. Griffith&#x27;s Charleston Park Lodge (a.k.a. Griffith&#x27;s Lodge) was built around 1915. A casino was later added to the lodge, which burned down in 1961. Historical postcards in the Pomona, Calif. Public Library show that lodge was at the present location of the Mt. Charleston Library and Volunteer Fire Department

===Mt. Charleston Lodge===

The Mt. Charleston Lodge was a longtime restaurant located adjacent to Cathedral Subdivision at the end of Nevada Rte. 157 Kyle Canyon Road. By 1948, the Mt. Charleston Lodge included a rustic 25-room lodge and 13 cottages, and was owned by the owners of the Frontier casino in Las Vegas.

A fire destroyed the Mt. Charleston Lodge on December 28, 1961. It took firefighters from Las Vegas more than an hour to reach the site, and a fire station was later built in Old Town to help stop any future fires. The Bailey family, owners of the Hacienda resort in Las Vegas, also owned the Mt. Charleston Lodge at the time of the fire, and they announced plans to rebuild it. Construction began in 1962. Four years later, a 150-person restaurant was added to the Mt. Charleston Lodge, which also had a 100-person lounge and 15 slot machines. The Orcutt family took over operations in 1974, and in 1994 added over a dozen cabins, located next to the restaurant. In 2018, it was sold to the Ellis family, which also owned the Ellis Island casino in Las Vegas.

On September 17, 2021, at approximately 4:45 a.m., a large fire destroyed the Mt. Charleston Lodge again. None of the adjacent cabins were damaged. The fire originated in a storage area under an exterior deck, and was not considered suspicious, although firefighters deemed the lodge a total loss. The Ellis family plans to rebuild the lodge, which was a local landmark and a popular gathering spot for the community. The cabins reopened a week after the fire.

In mid-2022, the Ellis family opened a temporary restaurant on the site known as Pine Dining, housed in a tent structure. Later that year, the family unveiled plans for a new Mt. Charleston Lodge that could include a hotel with more than 30 rooms.

===Hotel===

The Mount Charleston Hotel was built along Kyle Canyon Road in 1984. It has 64 rooms and a restaurant. In 2008, it was purchased by The Siegel Group, which renovated and renamed it as the Resort on Mount Charleston. In 2018, it was sold again and renamed as the Retreat on Charleston Peak, following another renovation.

===Canceled project===
In 1996, plans were announced for the Mount Charleston Golf Resort to be built in the area, as part of a project known as Alpine Village. The golf course opened in July 1997, next to the Mount Charleston Hotel. Later that year, the golf course was put up for sale. A hotel had been planned to accompany the course, but it was never built. Mount Charleston residents opposed plans for a shopping center that would also accompany the project. The shopping center was eventually rejected by the Clark County Commission.

The developer then started negotiations to swap the entire property with the federal government, which eventually purchased the site in 2004. The golf course had never been a popular attraction, and the U.S. Forest Service intended to restore the land to its natural state. Unfinished buildings from the project would be demolished, and the Forest Service planned to build a recreational complex on the site.

<text>Barton Hills is a village in Washtenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 316 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Ann Arbor Charter Township just northwest of the city of Ann Arbor.

Originally established by Detroit Edison president Alex Dow on land acquired for the Barton Dam, Barton Hills was designed as an exclusive, forested residential enclave just outside Ann Arbor. In 1944, the community was sold to its residents, and a village was incorporated in 1973. The streets in the village were formerly owned by the Barton Hills Maintenance Corporation but were purchased by the village itself in 2010.

==History==
In the early 1900s the land now occupied by Barton Hills Village was used for cattle grazing by a local firm, Towar Dairy. Around 1910 the Detroit Edison Company needed to increase its electrical generating capacity and decided to construct a series of dams and power stations along the Huron River. For that purpose they purchased 2,000 acres and water rights along both sides of the Huron River, including the Towar Dairy property. The present Barton Dam was built in 1913.

An area known as &quot;Huron Farms&quot; was established by the Detroit Edison Company in 1913 on this property on the north shore of the Huron River, adjacent to the City of Ann Arbor. Land owned by the company was also used for agricultural purposes, including farms, dairy cattle, and fruit orchards.

Detroit Edison&#x27;s president, Alex Dow, devoted parted of the company&#x27;s acquisition as an exclusive residential community for company executives. Dow and his wife Vivienne selected a site just north of the Barton Dam, on former pastureland, for their own house. In 1915, the company contracted with the Olmsted Brothers, famous for their park and subdivision designs, as landscape architects for the new community. The Olmsted Brothers architectural firm, designers of Central Park in New York City, were employed to lay out lot lines and roads which they did in great detail. Most of that plan is still in use today. At first a denuded hill sloping into the pond, jokingly referred to as &quot;Barren Hill&quot;, the Olmstead Brothers plan prescribed that the area be reforested. Several Detroit Edison executives had constructed homes along the river in this area by the early 1920s. In 1924 the company platted and deeded the Towar parcel as a subdivision called Barton Hills, and in the process placed deed restrictions on the property to ensure that it would remain a controlled residential community. When homes were constructed in the 1920s, restrictions attached to each deed stipulated that the homes must be designed by a registered architect.

The Barton Hills Country Club, the only business establishment within the village, was founded in 1917. Membership in the Barton Hills Country Club was considered by many to be a mark of distinction. In 2020, about 45% of Barton Hills residents were members of the country club.

The subdivision was in its early years considered too far from Ann Arbor to be attractive, and grew slowly. The economic depression of the 1930s slowed all types of building, and it was only in the post-World War II years of the 1950s and 1960s that construction of private homes resumed in earnest. This has continued so that few empty lots remain.

By the 1940s, through the economic and social turmoil of the Great Depression and World War II, the community had become an economic liability for a public utility. The company shareholders decided to make an outright gift of its holding to the residents of the community in exchange for assuming responsibility for maintaining the water system, roads, and other municipal services. However, the community did not seek municipal status until some thirty years later. On December 12, 1973, the community became the first home rule village in Washtenaw County.

<text>North Las Vegas is a suburban city in Clark County, Nevada, United States, in the Las Vegas Valley. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 262,527, with an estimated population of 280,543 in 2022. The city was incorporated on May 1, 1946. It is the 4th most populous city in the state of Nevada, and the 75th most populous city in the United States.

==History==
Native Americans were the first to inhabit the area. Paiute Indians settled in the area in around 700 AD.

During the 1860s, Conrad Kiel established a ranch at the modern-day intersection of Carey Street and Losee Road in what would be North Las Vegas. In 1917, libertarian Thomas L. Williams of Eureka, Utah visited the Las Vegas Valley, back when Las Vegas, Las Vegas Indian Colony, and Arden were the only entities in the valley. He did not approve of Las Vegas, perhaps because of its rowdiness (he was a Christian, or at least went to church), or because Las Vegas&#x27; attempts at municipal control over its citizens. However, he was pleased by the abundance of the valley&#x27;s artesian water and potential for agriculture. Two years later in 1919, he moved together with his family (his wife and three sons) to a 160-acre piece of land a mile from Las Vegas. That year, he founded his town, developing the town by building for himself and his family a house, sinking a well, grading roads, extending power lines, and forming a system of irrigation ditches. Williams believed that churches and church people should govern the new town, and so encouraged churches to buy property in the town. In 1919, the federally enforced Volstead Act was passed, which prohibited the sale, possession, and consumption of alcohol. Since there was no local law against alcohol, and because of a system of tunnels that would connect the town&#x27;s underground speakeasies, the town attracted bootleggers from Las Vegas, although Williams was initially unaware of this. This gave his town the nickname of &quot;Old Town&quot;. When he did discover it, he stuck with agriculture for his economic purposes.

In 1924, Williams built his second house that was the first business of the town. It was named the Oasis Auto Court, and it contained a grocery store, a campground, a post office, a community center, and a telephone. At the time, it was the town&#x27;s only telephone. Between 1928 and 1935, a large influx of workers from the Hoover Dam settled in Williams&#x27; town, as Las Vegas was intolerant towards them. In 1932, the town board was created. That same year, the town&#x27;s first grammar school, Washington School, opened. A proper name had not yet been established for the town, and Williams did not want it named after himself, which lead to the town board voting for either &quot;North Las Vegas&quot; or &quot;Vegas Verdes&quot; (which means &quot;Green Meadows&quot; in Spanish). &quot;Vegas Verdes&quot; won, and that became the name for the town for a few months. George Hansen, a town board member who voted for the name &quot;North Las Vegas&quot;, noticed that at one town board meeting, two members who voted the name &quot;Vegas Verdes&quot; were absent. The vote for a name came once again, and &quot;North Las Vegas&quot; won. In 1939, Williams died of stroke, and that left North Las Vegas to the ruling of the town board. An elementary school, and a road, were eventually named after him. During World War II, the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School opened in North Las Vegas. It would eventually become Nellis Air Force Base. North Las Vegas was the subject of many annexation attempts from Las Vegas. On May 1, 1946, North Las Vegas was incorporated as a city. In 1957, North Las Vegas planned to annex an area to its southeast, and in response, the Clark County Commission created the town of Sunrise Manor to prevent further annexation attempts.

On May 13, 1964, First Lieutenant Raynor Lee Hebert, a student pilot from Port Arthur, Texas, took off from Nellis Air Force Base at approximately 2:00 PM on an F-105 fighter jet. He radioed his flight leader saying that he could not retract his nose gear, and thus could not gain altitude. He was at a height high enough to bail out, but too low that if he did, he would&#x27;ve hit Lincoln Elementary School, which was in session with 800 students. He kept the plane nose up long enough to pass the school, and eventually hit nine residential houses on Lenwood Avenue. The crash killed Hebert and four civilians. Hebert Memorial Park was created by the City of North Las Vegas with a plaque at the crash site to commemorate Hebert.

In the early 1960s, North Las Vegas had a major growth boom. The 1970s in North Las Vegas saw a growth in poor neighborhoods, population density, and crime. In 1988, former mayor James Seastrand said in one interview,

In the 1990s, North Las Vegas annexed about of empty desert surrounding the city, reportedly for more &quot;upscale&quot; housing.

On January 29, 2022, nine people were killed and a tenth person was critically injured following a six-vehicle crash at the intersection of Cheyenne Avenue and Commerce Street in North Las Vegas. The crash occurred after a speeding Dodge Challenger ran a red light and struck the other five vehicles. The road accident—the deadliest in the area in recent history—was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board.

<text>Paradise is an unincorporated town and census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Nevada, United States, adjacent to the city of Las Vegas. It was formed on December 8, 1950. Its population was 191,238 at the 2020 census, making it the fifth-most-populous CDP in the United States; if it were an incorporated city, it would be the fifth-largest in Nevada. As an unincorporated town, it is governed by the Clark County Commission with input from the Paradise Town Advisory Board.

Paradise contains Harry Reid International Airport, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), the majority of the Las Vegas Strip, and most of the tourist attractions in the Las Vegas area (excluding downtown). However, all Paradise addresses, as well as other unincorporated areas in the Las Vegas Valley, have &quot;Las Vegas&quot; addresses.

==History==
The southern part of the Las Vegas Valley was referred to as Paradise Valley as early as 1910, owing to a high water table that made the land particularly fertile for farming. County commissioners established a Paradise school district in 1914.
In 1950, mayor Ernie Cragin of Las Vegas sought to annex the Las Vegas Strip, which was unincorporated territory, in order to expand the city&#x27;s tax base to fund his ambitious building agenda and pay down the city&#x27;s rising debt. A group of casino executives, led by Gus Greenbaum of the Flamingo, lobbied the county commissioners for town status, which would prevent the city from annexing the land without the commission&#x27;s approval. The commission voted to create the unincorporated town of Paradise on December 8, 1950. The town encompassed a strip wide and long, from the southern city limits of Las Vegas to just south of the Flamingo. The town board initially consisted of five casino managers, chaired by Greenbaum.

A month after its establishment, the town was expanded to include the residential areas of Paradise Valley, giving it a total area of . Months later, however, it was reported that county officials had determined that the town had not been properly established, because the petition for the town&#x27;s formation had an insufficient number of signatures and because it had violated a state law forbidding formation of a town spanning multiple school districts. On August 20, 1951, county commissioners accepted petitions to create two new towns covering the area of the putative town. Town &quot;A&quot; of Paradise included the areas that lay within a Las Vegas school district, extending from the city limits to a point one mile south, while Town &quot;B&quot; included the areas within the Paradise school district.

In 1953, Town A was renamed as Winchester, and Town B became known simply as Paradise.

In 1975, Nevada enacted a law that would have incorporated Paradise (along with Sunrise Manor and Winchester) into the City of Las Vegas. Before it could take effect, however, the bill was struck down as unconstitutional by the Nevada Supreme Court.

<text>Harper Woods is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Harper Woods borders Detroit to the north and east, roughly northeast of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 15,492.

==Etymology==
According to the city&#x27;s website, Harper Woods was so named because it was then a wooded area and because its main thoroughfare was Harper Avenue (named for Walter Harper, founder of Harper Hospital in Detroit).

==History==
Harper Woods was incorporated as a city on February 19, 1951, from what was left of Gratiot Township. A charter commission was elected, a charter prepared and adopted, and a city council elected. The City of Harper Woods came into existence on October 29, 1951, when the charter took effect, and the first city council was sworn in.

The fledgling suburb faced the usual problems confronting new cities: schools, streets, sidewalks, water systems, drains, etc. In 1956, Harper Woods was the subject of a community service study by the Bureau of Government, Institute of Public Administration, at the University of Michigan.

The development of Harper Woods reflected the growth of metropolitan Detroit. In 1955, Interstate 94 (I-94) (which bisects the eastern part of the suburb) was approved, and construction on the Eastland Shopping Center began soon after. Eastland Center, one of the first outdoor malls in the Midwest, opened in 1957. Harper Woods continued to develop and grow over the decades. In 2001, Harper Woods celebrated its 50th anniversary.

=== Pension fund lawsuit===
In September 2007, the City of Harper Woods Employees’ Retirement Scheme filed suit against British-based defense contractor BAE Systems. The suit alleges that BAE Systems executives funneled approximately $2 billion to Saudi ambassador Prince Bandar. The suit, which made news around the world, seeks governance changes to the BAE Systems board, and efforts to redress the losses due to this alleged corruption.

On December 29, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals rejected the Scheme&#x27;s claim. Representatives for the Scheme later said that they would consider appealing to the Supreme Court.

===City manager controversy===
On June 14, 2021, the Harper Woods City Council voted 4–3 to not renew the contract of City Manager Joseph Rheker. The vote took place shortly after Rheker had returned from active duty with the Navy Reserve, but Mayor Valerie Kindle said that the council&#x27;s decision was unrelated to his military service.

The council later offered the vacant city manager position to Monique Owens, who was mayor of Eastpointe at the time. At the special council meeting, the council did not allow residents to comment on the city manager hiring until after the council had already made its decision. However, Owens did not meet the conditions of the offer, and the city rescinded it the following day.

Owens later became embroiled in multiple scandals. In 2022, she was censured by the Eastpointe City Council, sued by residents who alleged that she violated their civil rights, and was found to have violated Eastpointe&#x27;s ethics ordinance. In 2023, she pleaded no contest to making a false statement on a grant application for her business. She was also ousted as mayor in that year&#x27;s primary election.

===Cultural history===
Though a relatively new city, Harper Woods has played a role in the cultural history of Metro Detroit.

For many years, the city was home to the East Side Drive-In (located at 19440 Harper Avenue, near 7 Mile Road), the first drive-in theater in Metro Detroit and one of the first in the Midwest. The East Side opened May 26, 1938, with &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;, starring W. C. Fields and Dorothy Lamour. Automobile capacity in later years was listed at 970 vehicles. The East Side closed in 1977 and was demolished a year later.

The Hideout (located at 20542 Harper Avenue, at Beaufait Street) was a popular teen dance club in the mid-1960s. Many Detroit-area music acts - including some that would go on to national prominence - performed at the club. Among them were Bob Seger, Mitch Ryder, Ted Nugent, Glenn Frey (later of the Eagles), and Suzi Quatro. One performance at the club by the MC5 was described by their manager John Sinclair. The Hideout spawned a local record label, Hideout Records. A 2001 compact disc, &quot;Friday at the Hideout: Boss Detroit Garage Bands 1964-1967&quot;, documents the scene. One of the first bands to play at the Hideout, The Underdogs, wrote &quot;Friday Night at the Hideout&quot;. Dave Leone is credited as the writer on the record.

Another venue for local bands in the 1960s and 1970s was Notre Dame High School. According to various accounts, &quot;All the Motown artists used to come and lip-sync to their records. Local neighborhood bands got to play live.&quot; Among the local performers of note who played dances and concerts at the school were The Amboy Dukes (featuring Ted Nugent), Bob Seger and the Last Heard, Frijid Pink, The Frost, Salem Witchcraft, Toby Redd, The Almighty Strut, and other acts.

U.S. Poet Laureate Donald Hall&#x27;s 1970s poem, &quot;Poem With One Fact&quot;, alludes to the city. Similarly, in 1986, the critically acclaimed crime fiction writer Loren D. Estleman unflatteringly portrayed the city in his Amos Walker novel &quot;Every Brilliant Eye&quot;. Among other works, the Detroit-area crime fiction writer Elmore Leonard mentions the city in his 2000 novel, &quot;Pagan Babies&quot;. Jeffrey Eugenides&#x27; bestselling 1993 novel &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; as well as his Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Middlesex&quot; also mention Harper Woods.

Betty Bahr, an early local television personality, Leonard H. Bahr, a fine press printer and publisher (Adagio Press), Helen Filarski, professional baseball player from 1945 to 1950, Laura Joh Rowland, author of historical mystery fiction, and Angela Ruggiero, 2006 Olympics bronze medal winner (ice hockey), have been among its better known residents. Dave Coulier, a popular television and voice actor, graduated from Notre Dame High School.

For decades, Eastland Center dominated the cultural and commercial profile of the suburb. The mall housed a celebrated work of public sculpture, &quot;The Lion and Mouse&quot;, by Marshall Fredericks.

==Geography==

The Grosse Pointe School District manages Charles A. Poupard Elementary School in Harper Woods, and residents of Harper Woods in that school district are zoned to Poupard as well as two secondary schools in Grosse Pointe Woods: Parcells Middle School and Grosse Pointe North High School. In June 2019 the school board voted to close Poupard Elementary School as the numbers of students had declined.

Harper Woods is also home to the charter schools of Chandler Park Academy Elementary, Middle, and High Schools, and Starr Academy.

The Chandler Park Academy, a K-12 charter school, is in Harper Woods.

In the fall of 2002, Bishop Gallagher and St. Florian High School in Hamtramck merged to form Trinity Catholic High School in Harper Woods. In 2005 the archdiocese announced that Trinity and Notre Dame, an all-boys parochial school in Harper Woods, would close. The all-girls Regina High School, once located in Harper Woods, moved to the nearby suburb of Warren in the fall of 2007.

=== Satellite college campuses ===

<text>Lincoln Park is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 38,144 at the 2010 census, down from 40,008 at the 2000 census. With a population density of at the 2010 census, Lincoln Park is the second most-densely populated municipality in the state after Hamtramck.

Lincoln Park contains Council Point Park, which dates back to 1763 when Chief Pontiac met with other tribal leaders along the banks of the Ecorse River to plot a rebellion against increasing European settlers, specifically those in nearby Fort Detroit. The Potawatomi eventually ceded the land to the French in 1776.  

Lincoln Park is considered part of the Downriver collection of communities within Metro Detroit. The city borders Detroit to the north and also shares borders with Allen Park to the west, Ecorse to the east, Melvindale to the north, and Southgate and Wyandotte to the south. It developed as a bedroom community, providing homes to workers in the nearby steel mills and automobile plants of the Detroit area, while having no industries of its own. Lincoln Park was originally part of the now-defunct Ecorse Township, incorporating as a village in 1921 and again as a city in 1925.

== History ==

Long before Lincoln Park was incorporated as a city, an area along the Ecorse River was the site of a pivotal meeting during Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion. On April 27, 1763, a council of several American Indian tribes from the Detroit region listened to a speech from the Ottawa leader Pontiac. Pontiac urged the listeners to join him in a surprise attack on the British Fort Detroit, which they attempted on May 9. Today, the area is known as Council Point Park, and a small engraved boulder marks the site of the historic meeting.

Neighborhoods were first laid in the area of Ecorse Township that would become Lincoln Park in 1906. It was incorporated as a village in 1921, and as a city in 1925.

Preston Tucker, famous for his controversial financing and development of the revolutionary 1948 Tucker Sedan, grew up in Lincoln Park in the early 1900s. Tucker joined the Lincoln Park Police Department in his early years to gain access to the high performance cars the department used.

During the 20th century, Lincoln Park grew as a bedroom community for the numerous workers at Henry Ford&#x27;s River Rouge Plant and other mills and factories of the auto industry. Two major shopping hubs were constructed in the 1950s: Lincoln Park Plaza in 1955 on the southeast side and the Lincoln Park Shopping Center the following year on the northwest side.

Among Lincoln Park&#x27;s minor claims to fame is that it was the home of the members of the seminal punk rock group MC5 in the 1960s. The band was rumored to have evolved out of the group&#x27;s habit of listening to music from a car radio in the parking lot of the local White Castle restaurant in the small downtown area. Gary Grimshaw, a noted rock concert poster artist, grew up in Lincoln Park at the same time.

The north and south branches of the Ecorse River run through Lincoln Park and join just before leaving the city. Lincoln Park borders the cities of Detroit, Allen Park, Melvindale, Ecorse, Wyandotte, and Southgate.

<doc id="124387" wikidata="Q853552" url="?curid=124387" title="Livonia, Michigan">
<text>Livonia ( ) is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A western suburb of Detroit, Livonia is located roughly northwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 95,535. Originally organized as Livonia Township in 1835, it was incorporated as a city in 1950.

==History==
After most members of the indigenous tribes were pushed out of the area, ethnic European-American pioneers from New England and New York settled here. The borders of Livonia Township were defined by the Legislature of the Territory of Michigan on March 17, 1835.

The settlers named the community &quot;Livonia&quot;, after Livonia, New York, a town in the western part of the state, from where many had migrated.

Livonia Township was split off from Nankin Township, in which a Livonia post office had been established in June 1834. During the days of the township, a number of small communities developed. One of these was Elmwood, initially known as McKinley&#x27;s Station. It was a stop on the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad. It had a separate post office from 1858 until 1906. Another post office in the township was Giltedge, which operated from 1899 until 1902.

Livonia was incorporated as a city on May 23, 1950, by vote of the citizens of the township. An incentive was that this status would allow the residents to gain tax revenues from the Detroit Race Course (DRC). From 1985, it ran only harness racing for Standardbred, and the track closed in 1998, when the large property was sold for redevelopment. The last race tracks operating in the state were Hazel Park Raceway, which closed in 2018, and Northville Downs, which closed in 2019.

Among the immigrants attracted to Detroit for its industrial jobs in the 20th century have been Palestinian and Lebanese Christians, as well as Muslims. By 1985, Palestinian Christians had settled in Livonia, as well as the western suburbs of Farmington and Westland. As of 2005, there were a number of Christian Palestinian Americans who had immigrated from Ramallah. They have developed and operated several small- and medium-sized businesses.

Six U.S. presidents have visited Livonia: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

==Geography==

<doc id="124389" wikidata="Q177756" url="?curid=124389" title="Searchlight, Nevada">
<text>Searchlight is an unincorporated town and census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Nevada, United States, at the topographic saddle between two mountain ranges. At the 2020 census it had a population of 445.

==History==

According to U.S. Senator Harry Reid (1939–2021), who wrote extensively about his hometown, the most likely story as to how the town received its name was that when George Frederick Colton was looking for gold in the area on May 6, 1897, he supposedly said that it would take a searchlight to find gold ore there. Shortly thereafter, he found gold, leading to a boom era when Searchlight had a larger population than Las Vegas. At the time, it was in Lincoln County, Nevada. As talk surfaced for carving Clark County, Nevada out of Lincoln County, Searchlight was initially considered to be the county seat. Between 1907 and 1910, the gold mines produced $7 million in gold and other precious minerals, and the town had a population of about 1,500. The ore was shipped to Barnwell via the Barnwell and Searchlight Railway.

Other stories on the origin of the name include a story that Colton was lighting a Searchlight brand match when he discovered the gold ore. Reid dismissed this story, saying that the Searchlight matches were not available in 1898. Yet another story says that Colton thought the area would be a good place because it was on a hill. His mine was called the Duplex, because the gold ore was found on two levels.

Searchlight declined after 1917 but remained as a stop on the Arrowhead Highway. In 1927, U.S. Route 91 bypassed the town and its population dropped to 50.

The town had a resurgence in the 1930s and 1940s with the construction of the nearby Hoover Dam and was the site of the El Rey Bordello in the 1940s and early 1950s until the bordello burned down. The last gold mine ceased operating around 1953.

==Geography==
===Climate===
The city experiences a desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters, but it is not uncommon to see temperatures below freezing. Searchlight&#x27;s elevation makes temperatures somewhat cooler than lower-elevation areas in the Mojave Desert, such as Baker, California; Needles, California; and Fort Mohave, Arizona. However, summers can still be extremely hot. Due to Searchlight&#x27;s altitude and aridity, temperatures drop quickly after sunset, especially in the summer. Daytime highs in the winter are usually well above freezing, and nighttime lows drop below freezing only a few nights a year.

==Demographics==

<text>Spring Valley is an unincorporated town and census-designated place in Clark County, Nevada, United States, located west of the Las Vegas Strip. The population was 215,597 at the 2020 census. Spring Valley was formed in May 1981.

==History==
In 1965, the Stardust International Raceway was built by the Stardust Resort and Casino. In 1969, the Stardust was sold to the Parvin-Dohrmann Corporation, which had little interest in the raceway and then leased it until 1970, when Pardee Homes purchased the land. They began developing a master-planned housing community called Spring Valley. The community was named by Doug Pardee and sales manager Jack Whiteman, in reference to its views of the Spring Mountains and its location in the Las Vegas Valley. In 1981, residents grouped together to solicit the Clark County Commission to create an unincorporated town, which it did that May. The residents wanted to create the town due to hypothetical annexations into other communities in the Las Vegas Valley, and because they claimed they did not pay their taxes fairly for county services. The town originally encompassed , but now occupies much of the southwest quarter of the Las Vegas Valley, totaling .

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the census-designated place (CDP) of Spring Valley (which may not exactly coincide with the town boundaries) has a total area of , all of it land.

The predominant boundaries of Spring Valley are Sahara Avenue on the north, Decatur Boulevard on the east, Warm Springs Road on the south, and Hualapai Way on the west.

The area mostly consists of housing subdivisions, with strip malls lining the large boulevards that connect suburban Las Vegas to the Strip. The northern part of Spring Valley includes areas of rural-estate zoning, with large parcels of land on blocks of . The southern part of Spring Valley is quickly developing – fifteen years ago, very little south of Tropicana Avenue was developed within Spring Valley.

A large park, Desert Breeze Park, is located in the north-central part of the town. Next to the park is Roger M. Bryan Elementary School.

===Chinatown===

The strip malls along Spring Mountain Road and surrounding streets, from Valley View to Jones Boulevard in Spring Valley into Paradise, house many ethnic Chinese and other pan-Asian businesses, with the original called &quot;Chinatown Plaza&quot;. The district is primarily a retail destination, rather than a residential enclave, catering to Asian Americans.

The Chinatown Plaza strip mall was conceived by Taiwanese American James Chih-Cheng Chen and opened in February 1995 at the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn; it has of space and was designed by Simon Lee in a style inspired by Tang dynasty buildings. Chen called it &quot;America&#x27;s first master-planned Chinatown&quot;. The plaza was funded by JHK Investment Group, Inc., which Chen had formed with two high school classmates: Henry Chen-Jen Hwang and K.C. Chen (no relation). James Chen, an emigrant from Taiwan who arrived in Los Angeles in 1971 with $30, saw a demand for Asian food and restaurants: &quot;I see so many Asian tourists here [in Las Vegas], but I see no Asian business people. They&#x27;re happy with everything in Las Vegas except the food.&quot; Sharon Hwang, Henry&#x27;s daughter, recalled her father was similarly inspired by stories he would hear from tourists returning from Las Vegas to Los Angeles: &quot;... We figured all the Southern California Chinese, they love to come to Vegas, gambling; that was the thing. So they would come average, I would say, once or twice a year at least. But everybody&#x27;s thing was, there&#x27;s no Chinese food; there&#x27;s no good Chinese food in Las Vegas, nothing authentic, just nothing really. It was kind of a joke almost in California.&quot; By 1996, the plaza was visited by approximately 3,000 to 5,000 daily, and Chen was planning to open the Far East Trade Center later that year for manufacturers to exhibit their goods.

Clark County designated Chinatown Plaza as the Asian Pacific American Cultural Center on May 7, 1996, the first official recognition of the new district. Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn officially designated the district along Spring Mountain from Las Vegas Boulevard to Rainbow Boulevard as Chinatown in October 1999 and it continues to grow as the Asian population in Las Vegas expands rapidly. The Chinatown area has gained much popularity, receiving national attention in a 2004 article by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. &quot;Huffington Post&quot; classifies the Chinatowns in Las Vegas, Atlanta-Chamblee, Dallas-Richardson, and North Miami Beach as &quot;modern&quot; styled Chinatown, in contrast with the historic core Chinatowns in New York and San Francisco. The Las Vegas Chinatown is pan-Asian in nature instead of being completely Chinese according to the previous source. The official website for the Chinatown Plaza indicates that Spring Mountain Road is the general corridor for the neighborhood.

The history of Chinese population in the Las Vegas Valley shows that the Chinese population remained small throughout most of its history. As a result, a Chinatown could only be created with initiative from entrepreneurs that would in essence fabricate a scenario that came naturally in other large cities that have historically important Chinatowns. According to Bonnie Tsui, Las Vegas&#x27;s Chinese population boomed starting from the 1960s and by the 1990s, the Chinese population grew to 15,000 with the majority working in the casino industry. Even as the population grew, the &quot;Chinatown experiment&quot; could not rely on the local Chinese population to create it, but relied on a label on the plaza itself before people knew it was &quot;Chinatown&quot;. In addition, Senator Harry Reid &quot;... ordered a sign to be put up for Chinatown [along Interstate 15]...&quot; but was taken down by the order of the governor of Nevada Bob Miller.

<doc id="124392" wikidata="Q993749" url="?curid=124392" title="Sunrise Manor, Nevada">
<text>Sunrise Manor is a census-designated place in Clark County, Nevada, United States, located on the western base of Frenchman Mountain, east of Las Vegas. The population was 205,618 at the 2020 census. If Sunrise Manor were to be incorporated, it would be one of the largest cities in Nevada. Sunrise Manor was formed in May 1957.

==History==
In 1957, North Las Vegas was planning for annexation of the area; the Clark County Commission did not approve of it and so created Sunrise Manor in May of the same year. It originally only consisted of the northern fraction of its modern-day boundary. By the time of the 1970 Census, the census-designated place of Vegas Creek was formed to the south of Sunrise Manor. It was dissolved in 1980, and added to Sunrise Manor the same year, roughly making Sunrise Manor&#x27;s boundaries similar to its modern-day borders.

In 2018, some of the residents of Sunrise Manor proposed incorporation as its own city. This proposed city would include Sunrise Manor and neighboring Whitney. Residents who were for incorporation argued that Sunrise Manor does not get enough recognition being part of Clark County and that a city would need to address crime, drugs, and homelessness, while residents who were against incorporation argued that incorporation will be costly and inefficient, comparing it to North Las Vegas.

<text>Whitney (formerly East Las Vegas) is an unincorporated town and census-designated place in Clark County, Nevada, United States. The population was 38,585 at the 2010 census.

==Background==
Stowell E. Whitney, a dairy farmer from Bunkerville, Nevada, purchased a ranch in the area in the 1910s. The town of Whitney was established in 1931, when Whitney subdivided his ranch due to the construction of the Boulder Highway. Much of this land is now within Henderson city limits. He didn&#x27;t attract many buyers, since this took place during the Great Depression. A Whitney post office was opened the following year. The town was officially founded in 1942 by the Clark County Commission, and that year Whitney was given official borders. The town was renamed as East Las Vegas in 1958, in response to a petition signed by almost all the residents. The name was changed back to Whitney in 1993.

Prior to the 1970s, Whitney was one of a few small communities between Las Vegas and Henderson along Boulder Highway (which was US 93, US 95 and US 466 at the time). Whitney Elementary School was a converted barracks. It housed grades from first to seventh until the 1960s; after that, seventh-graders were moved to Henderson Junior High. In the early years, the town&#x27;s post office was operated by John and Nellie Bunch, owners of much of the Whitney property and surrounding areas. The town consisted of three streets running east and west: Whitney Avenue, Keenan Avenue, and Missouri Avenue(Ghettos). Cross streets running north and south were 1st Street, 2nd Street, and 3rd Street. Older students attended Basic High School in Henderson. Some students attended [Chaparral high school] in East Las vegas.

In the early 1990s, the outward growth of development in Las Vegas and Henderson, as well as the construction of the Interstate 515 (now Interstate 11) bypass of Whitney, had a negative effect on businesses in the area. Business began to recover in the 2000s. The area has seen several new housing developments on vacant land. The people In this Neighborhood often refer to this neighborhood as East Las Vegas or Boulder district (BD).

It is home to Sam Boyd Stadium (formerly Las Vegas Stadium, Las Vegas Silver Bowl, and Sam Boyd Silver Bowl), the former home venue of the UNLV Rebels college football team.

<text>Winchester is an unincorporated town and census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Nevada, United States that contains part of the Las Vegas Strip. It is one of a number of CDPs in the unincorporated urbanized area directly south of Las Vegas. The population was 36,403 at the 2020 census. It is governed by the Clark County Commission with advice from the Winchester Town Advisory Board. &quot;Winchester, NV&quot; does not appear in postal addresses; the United States Postal Service has assigned &quot;Las Vegas, NV&quot; as the place name for the ZIP codes containing Winchester.

==History==
The southern part of the Las Vegas Valley was referred to as Paradise Valley as early as 1910, owing to a high water table that made the land particularly fertile for farming. County commissioners established a Paradise school district in 1914.

In 1950, mayor Ernie Cragin of Las Vegas sought to annex the Las Vegas Strip, which was unincorporated territory, in order to expand the city&#x27;s tax base to fund his ambitious building agenda and pay down the city&#x27;s rising debt. A group of casino executives, led by Gus Greenbaum of the Flamingo, lobbied the county commissioners for town status, which would prevent the city from annexing the land without the commission&#x27;s approval. The commission voted to create the unincorporated town of Paradise on December 8, 1950. A month after its establishment, the town was expanded to include the residential areas of Paradise Valley. Months later, however, it was reported that county officials had determined that the town had not been properly established, because the petition for the town&#x27;s formation had an insufficient number of signatures and because it had violated a state law forbidding formation of a town spanning multiple school districts. On August 20, 1951, county commissioners accepted petitions to create two new towns covering the area of the putative town. Town &quot;A&quot; of Paradise included the areas that lay within a Las Vegas school district, extending from the city limits to a point one mile south, while Town &quot;B&quot; included the areas within the Paradise school district. In 1953, Town A was renamed as Winchester, and Town B became known simply as Paradise. Ultimately, in 1956 state law consolidated all local school districts into a countywide school district, which in the Las Vegas Valley&#x27;s case is the Clark County School District.

==Geography==
Winchester sits in the east-central part of the Las Vegas Valley. To the north it borders Las Vegas, to the west and south is the CDP of Paradise, and to the east is Sunrise Manor.

<text>Sauk Rapids ( ) is a city in Benton County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 13,862 at the 2020 census and is 13,896 according to 2021 census estimates, about a third of Benton County&#x27;s population. It is on a set of rapids on the Mississippi River near its confluence with the Sauk River.

Sauk Rapids is part of the St. Cloud metropolitan area.

==History==
Sauk Rapids was originally little more than a forest of oak, maple and basswood trees along the Mississippi River until the first home was constructed there in 1851, a large mansion named Lynden Terrace erected by W.H. Wood. Soon other settlers followed and the town was named Sauk Rapids after the rapids just below the Sauk River&#x27;s mouth on the Mississippi. The new settlement was along the Red River Trails.

Soon a general store was built, then a hotel, and a large jail. The first settlers organized a church that was soon followed by a Methodist, an Episcopalian and a Lutheran church. The first paper outside of St. Paul was the &quot;Sauk Rapids Frontiersman&quot;, founded in 1854.

A flour mill was erected in 1875, but was destroyed in 1886. The first bridge was built in 1876, was destroyed later in 1876, and was rebuilt in 1879. The first school was built in 1886.

In 1874, Sauk Rapids was the end of the line for the new railroad. Settlers from as far away as the Red River Valley brought their produce there to ship it. A six-horse stage coach made biweekly trips between St. Cloud and Crow Wing.

In 1856, the county seat moved to Watab, then returned to Sauk Rapids in 1859. A new courthouse was built, but in 1897 the seat moved to Foley, where it remains. In 1917 the courthouse burned down.

Sauk Rapids was one of Minnesota&#x27;s most important cities until 1886, when, on April 14 at approximately 4:00 p.m., a tornado struck the town. It swept through the center of the city, destroying all the stores. In Sauk Rapids, 44 people were killed and several hundred were injured.

The Sauk Rapids Regional Bridge was completed in 2007. The new bridge links to 2nd Street rather than 1st Street, as the original Sauk Rapids Bridge did. Several buildings had to be demolished during the construction process, and some were rebuilt. Some sidewalks were repaved with cobblestone and the medians were filled with granite blocks.

A large share of the first settlers were Germans. Minden was founded on company land of the Dangberg Home Ranch and Dangberg commissioned most of the town&#x27;s early buildings. Minden has had a post office since 1906.

=== Use of sundown siren and sundown town status ===
Minden sounded a &quot;sundown siren&quot; at 6pm almost every evening from 1917 until 2023, originally signifying that members of the Washoe Indian tribe were required to leave town by 6:30pm or face jail or fine. Douglas County fully repealed its sundown ordinance in the mid-1970s.

In 2021, the State of Nevada passed a law that prohibits communities from sounding signals associated with a past law &quot;which required persons of a particular race, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin or color to leave the town by a certain time.&quot; Minden Town Manager J. D. Frisbee claimed the law doesn&#x27;t apply to them stating, “There’s a (Minden) ordinance in place right now that says that the siren sounds every day in commemoration of our first responders. … It never went off at 6:30, when the county had an ordinance to get Native Americans out of town.”

After another Nevada law targeting sundown sirens, S.B. 391, was passed in 2023, Minden finally silenced the siren. Marty Meeden, a retired elementary school teacher of Washoe descent, expressed relief, saying, &quot;Did you hear about the partially deaf senior woman who was verbalized for being in town after sunset? Did you hear about the routine picking up of our young men who were beaten and then left out in the fields?... This is the history we as children learned in regards to the siren.&quot;

<doc id="124409" wikidata="Q1020993" url="?curid=124409" title="Stateline, Nevada">
<text>Stateline is a census-designated place (CDP) on the southeastern shore of Lake Tahoe in Douglas County, Nevada, United States. It lies next to the border with California and is conurbated with South Lake Tahoe. The population was 595 at the 2020 census. The population swells considerably during the busy winter and summer seasons, due to the high number of hotel rooms and rental accommodations available.

==Attractions==
Stateline is home to four casino resorts: Bally&#x27;s Lake Tahoe (formerly Caesars Tahoe and MontBleu), Golden Nugget Lake Tahoe (formerly Horizon and Hard Rock), Harrah&#x27;s Lake Tahoe, and Harveys Lake Tahoe. Until its closure on April 14, 2020, the Lakeside Inn catered to locals and modest gamblers.

Many of the hotels in the neighboring city of South Lake Tahoe, California, organize buses to take residents to the casinos in Stateline. Stateline and South Lake Tahoe are effectively a single settlement, with the state line intersecting with U.S. Route 50 immediately after the Harrah&#x27;s and Harvey&#x27;s casinos. As commercial gambling establishments are illegal in California unless built on Indian reservations, the casinos are extremely popular with California residents due to their strategic location right on the state line.

The Edgewood Tahoe Resort golf course lies along the Lake Tahoe shoreline. The Heavenly Mountain Resort ski area is on the California–Nevada border.

Another well-known feature of Stateline is Kingsbury Grade, which runs up and over a mountain pass, rising from Lake Tahoe and dropping down to the Carson Valley on the other side. Most of Stateline&#x27;s residential and seasonal accommodation, amenities and services are located on or near Kingsbury Grade. The route can be difficult in the winter months and snow chains are essential during this time. Larger vehicles are required to allow traffic to pass when five or more vehicles are queued behind them.

Another new attraction is the brand-new Tahoe Blue Event Center, an arena that plays host to many events and is home to the Tahoe Knight Monsters hockey team of the ECHL.

==Notable events==
* The Harvey&#x27;s Resort Hotel bombing occurred on August 26–27, 1980. The event ended when the bomb was inadvertently detonated during an attempt to disarm it. As a result, the north side of the building was destroyed.
* On the afternoon of January 5, 1998, the Heavenly Ski Resort was the scene of the death of musician and politician Sonny Bono. While skiing alone, Bono struck a tree on &quot;Orion&quot;, an intermediate slope high on Heavenly&#x27;s Nevada side, in Stateline.
* The 2007 film &quot;Smokin&#x27; Aces&quot; was filmed (known at the time) at the Horizon and the MontBleu Resort Casino &amp; Spa (fictionalized in-film as the &quot;Nomad&quot;) featuring many views of the shore from Aces&#x27; suite at the casino.

==History==
Most of the town and surrounding land has been maintained by the heirs of the historic Friday&#x27;s Station of the Pony Express; it is leased to the casinos. The duplex naming of the community originated in part because of an interstate border dispute, resulting from differences in several boundary surveys. The erroneous 1872 Von Schmidt survey of the California–Nevada boundary found the stateline crossing U.S. 50 on the west edge of present-day Applebee&#x27;s, and the east edge of the Ashley Marcus Gallery in Tahoe Crescent V Shopping Center in California. The community of Stateline, California, contended to be in Nevada, emerged just east to benefit from Nevada law—including tax-free status and later gambling which was legalized in 1931. However, an 1893 United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (C.G.S.) placed the border several thousand feet east of 1872 Von Schmidt line, creating a discrepancy which left the community in legal jeopardy. The Stateline Country Club operated in the 1930s. By the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, gambling development moved east across the 1893 C.G.S. line to a new adjacent community of Edgewood, Nevada. After a 1980 US Supreme Court ruling, the east-migrated gambling community of Edgewood formally regained its name Stateline, this time in NV.; the California portion which had been contested by Nevada was dissolved into the city of South Lake Tahoe. The currently accepted interstate border is marked by the 1893 US CGS Federal Survey Monuments No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3.

==Geography==
Stateline is located at (38.970512, −119.945714). It lies on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe to the east of the California–Nevada state line from which it takes its name, and the city of South Lake Tahoe, California.

Elko is home to Great Basin College, as well as to the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office, serving most of northern and central Nevada.

==History==

Though Elko lies along the route of the historic California Trail, its roots as a town date only back to its establishment in 1868 by settlers, when it was at the east end of the railroad tracks built by the Central Pacific Railroad (the portion of the First transcontinental railroad built from California to Utah). When the railroad crews moved on, Elko remained, serving as a center for ranching, mining, rail freight, and general supplies.
Elko is said to have been named by Charles Crocker, a superintendent of the Central Pacific Railroad. He was especially fond of animal names and added the letter &quot;o&quot; to Elk. There is no definitive evidence of this naming history, but it has become the widely accepted version.

The first Elko County Courthouse was built in 1869. Elko was officially incorporated as a city in 1917.

In 1925, the Kelly Act (also known as the Air Mail Act of 1925) authorized the United States Postal Service to contract with private airlines for the feeder routes that fed the main transcontinental route. The first commercial airmail flight in the United States was on the Airmail Route #5 from Pasco, Washington, to what would become Elko Regional Airport on April 6, 1926. The flight was piloted by Leon D. Cuddeback and included a brief stop in Boise, Idaho, to pick up more mail.

The 1910 replacement for the original courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The U.S. Post Office-Elko Main, which was built in 1933, is also listed.

==Economy==

Elko&#x27;s economy is based heavily on gold mining, with ranching, tourism and the casino industry providing additional jobs. The city is considered the capital of Nevada&#x27;s goldbelt. The state of Nevada produces more gold than all but four countries, and most of the gold from Nevada is mined near Elko. This has caused the town to have a boom and bust economy consistent with the rises and declines in the price of gold. The town is surrounded by hundreds of abandoned mining camps, and viewing them is a popular local activity. A gold boom in the 1980s that ended in a bust in the late 1990s left the town with large numbers of abandoned homes and left the local governments struggling to survive on reduced tax revenues. With a new gold boom starting in 2009, city officials have been reluctant to hire new employees and have decided to build a reserve in the city budget to prepare for the next bust.

Elko has struggled to bring in other industries, mostly because of its isolation and the surrounding harsh desert environment. Hunter S. Thompson quipped that in Elko, &quot;The federal government owns 90% of this land, and most of it is useless for anything except weapons testing and poison-gas experiments,&quot; although no experiments have been conducted in Elko or Elko County but were famously carried out at the Nevada Test Site near Rachel, in southern Nevada.

Every July, since 1963, Elko is host to the National Basque Festival. In 2013 they were scheduled to celebrate their 50th anniversary.

The festival includes strongman competitions, handball, a running of the bulls, traditional food and wine, and Basque dancing.

<text>Owyhee (, ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Elko County, Nevada, United States, along the banks of the Owyhee River. The population was 953 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Elko Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is the primary town of the federally recognized Shoshone-Paiute tribe&#x27;s Duck Valley Indian Reservation, which covers portions of northern Nevada and southern Idaho, and the majority of its population are Native American.

Owyhee, along with the rest of Nevada except for the city of West Wendover, is legally in the Pacific Time Zone. But, along with other Idaho border towns such as Jackpot, Mountain City and Jarbidge, it unofficially observes the Mountain Time Zone as it has closer proximity to and greater connections with towns in southern Idaho.

== History ==
The Tribes once freely occupied the land in the tri-state area of what is now Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon. This changed with the coming of migrants from the eastern United States and Europe, especially after the mid-19th century. Land and resources were wrested away from the Shoshone and Paiute. The tribes made treaties with the United States, of which some were ratified by the Senate and others not. The chiefs signed all the treaties in good faith and for the survival of their peoples.

Descendants of the Western Shoshone and the Northern Paiute occupy the Duck Valley Indian Reservation of Idaho and Nevada. Various bands of the two closely related tribes have jointly used the area for seasonal hunting and gathering from time immemorial.

On April 16, 1877, United States President Rutherford B. Hayes established the reservation for the Western Shoshone. In the early days of the Duck Valley reservation, the people built and lived in their traditional earthen, willow and sagebrush huts. Bands of Western Shoshone occupied and revolved on and off the reservation, depending on their survival needs and because of the unfulfilled promises of food and supplies from the federal government. Some bands adapted as best they could.

Others did not want to leave their homelands and campsites which were located off the reservation. The Northern Paiute bands became allied with their kin, the Bannock, in the Bannock War of 1878. After their defeat by the United States, survivors were relocated as prisoners to an Indian reservation in Yakima, Washington. Upon their release, the survivors were returned to their homelands, and the Western Shoshone reservation was expanded for their use in 1886.

In 1884, local settlers tried to get the Western Shoshone removed to the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho, in order to open up Duck Valley lands for non-Indian homesteads, but the chiefs successfully resisted this effort. 
The tribal bands located at Duck Valley were supervised by the Indian Agent and later Indian Police. Farming and ranching became the mainstay for the people. 
From 1884 through 1911 an Indian boarding school operated on the reservation. Thereafter three day schools were operated in three separate locations on the reservation. In Owyhee, the Swayne School was built.

In 1931, during the Great Depression, the day schools were closed, and all students were sent to the Swayne School. Students of the higher grades were sent off reservation to boarding schools until 1946, That year high school classes were finally added to the reservation school. In 1956 the reservation school system was consolidated into the Elko County School District of Nevada and today is known as the Owyhee Combined Schools (K-12). Recently, a community education center was placed in Owyhee for GED and higher education courses.

The first full-time physician was assigned to Duck Valley in 1882. By 1897 a small one-room infirmary hospital was built. It was replaced by 1920 with a structure which had two seven-bed wards.

The Shoshone and Paiute united at Duck Valley under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and formed a tribal government through adopting a constitution and bylaws for elected government in 1936. In July 1937 the native stone hospital was completed with a 20-bed ward, X-ray and laboratory facilities. The native stone hospital was closed in 1976 when the modern Owyhee Community Health Facility was completed.

==Government==
The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley are governed by the Business Council. The Business Council is composed of a chairman, vice-chairman and five council members, all of whom are elected to serve three-year terms. The Business Council directs the tribal government. The chairman manages the operations of tribal government. There are four divisions of tribal administration: Health &amp; Human Services, Judicial Services, Tribal Programs and Support Services.
Farming and ranching are still mainstays for Duck Valley and is reflected in the of lands. The Duck Valley Reservation is composed of held in trust by the United States government for the use and occupancy of the Shoshone-Paiute tribes. Included in the total acreage of the reservation are of wetlands. Wild Horse Reservoir was constructed in 1936 for the Duck Valley Irrigation Project.

Tribal membership is more than 2,000, with approximately 1,700 living on the reservation. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of Duck Valley continue to live within the historic territories of their ancestors.
