<text>Sedalia is a city located approximately south of the Missouri River and, as the county seat of Pettis County, Missouri, United States, it is the principal city of the Sedalia Micropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 21,725. Sedalia is also the location of the Missouri State Fair and the Scott Joplin International Ragtime Festival. U.S. Routes 50 and 65 intersect in the city.

==History==
Indigenous peoples lived along the Missouri River and its tributaries for thousands of years before European contact. Historians believe the entire area around Sedalia was long occupied by the Osage (among historical American Indian tribes). When the land was first settled by European Americans, bands of Shawnee, who had migrated from east of the Mississippi River, lived in the vicinity of Sedalia.

Until the city was incorporated in 1860 as Sedalia, it had existed only &quot;on paper&quot; from November 30, 1857, to October 16, 1860. According to local lore, the town council changed the name from Sedville to Sedalia in part because &quot;towns that end in -ville don&#x27;t amount to anything.&quot; (Lawrence Ditton Sr.). Here is another account:
The area that became the European-American city of Sedalia was founded by General George Rappeen Smith (1804–1879), who also founded nearby Smithton, Missouri. He filed plans for the official record on November 30, 1857, and gave the area the name Sedville. The original plat included the land from today&#x27;s Missouri Pacific Railroad south to Third Street.

The version jointly filed by General Smith and David W. Bouldin on October 16, 1860, displayed the city extending from Clay Street to the north and to Smith Street (today&#x27;s Third Street) in the south, and from Missouri Street in the west to Washington Street in the east; and, although Smith and Bouldin predicted that the city would grow to the north, it grew in a southern direction.

===Railhead===
Following a victory for those proposing the &quot;ridge route&quot; for the railway over those advocating the &quot;river route&quot;, the railway reached Sedalia in January 1861. Sedalia&#x27;s early prosperity was directly related to the railroad industry. Many jobs were associated with men maintaining tracks and operating large and varied machine shops run by both the Missouri Pacific and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad lines. The Missouri-Kansas &amp; Texas Railroad was widely known as the &quot;KATY&quot;, from its &quot;K-T&quot; stock exchange code.

Sedalia was an important for the massive Texas cattle drive of 1866. It maintained stockyards to receive cattle from drives and shipping through much of the 19th century.

For nearly a century, Sedalia&#x27;s economy was tied to the railroads. By the end of the 19th century, the MK&amp;T had numerous buildings and a wide variety of workers in the city: the MK&amp;T shops, stockyards, roundhouse, and the hospital for employees working in the Sedalia Division were among the Katy&#x27;s properties in Sedalia.

After the KATY reduced its operations in the 20th century, its railroad right-of-way through much of Missouri was converted to a 240-mile multi-use trail. The KATY Trail is used by bikers, walkers and horseback riders. This has been the largest new trail developed in the nation among the late 20th-century federal and state &quot;Rails to Trails&quot; projects.

===Civil War===

During the Civil War, the U.S. Army had a small garrison in the area, adding to its boomtown atmosphere of accelerated development as merchants and traders attracted to the military business came to the area. In the postbellum period, two railroads were constructed connecting it to other locations, and Sedalia grew at a rapid pace, with the rough energy of travelers and cowboys. From 1866 to 1874, it was a railhead terminus for cattle drives, and stockyards occupied a large area. At the same time, the town established schools (racially segregated for white and black children), churches, and other civic amenities.

On October 15, 1864, Shelby&#x27;s Confederate cavalry brigade surrounded the Union post of Sedalia. The post commander, Colonel John D. Crawford, fled. Captain Oscar B. Queen of Company M, 7th Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, surrendered the post shortly thereafter. Missouri State Guard Brigadier-General M. Jeff Thompson subsequently paroled the prisoners of war and moved on, leaving Sedalia to itself.

===Late 19th century===

While the Civil War delayed development of the town in some respects, Sedalia was the terminus of the railroad for three years. Once the war was over, many of the thousands of Union soldiers who had been stationed more or less permanently at Sedalia and recognized its potential, made the choice to migrate there from their former homes in other areas. The population grew rapidly.

In the late 19th century, Sedalia was well known as a center of vice, especially prostitution, which accompanied its large floating class of railroad workers and commercial travelers. In 1877 the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; called Sedalia the &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah of the nineteenth century.&quot; Middle-class businessmen made money off illegal prostitution as building owners and lessees; others did business with people in the industry, who banked, used lawyers, etc., in town. Residents were reluctant to raise taxes and services were provided from the fines charged to prostitutes.

In the 1870s brothels were distributed throughout the city, but in the 1890s, they became more concentrated above businesses on West Main Street, as the middle class tried to isolate less desirable elements in town. These establishments also employed musicians, particularly piano players, contributing to a thriving musical culture. It fostered the development of many artists, including the renowned ragtime composer Scott Joplin.

===20th and 21st centuries===
While the city attracted many commercial travelers and railroad workers, its population of married couples and families also grew. By 1900 its population of more than 15,000 made it the sixth-largest city in the state. The entrepreneurial middle class created more formal separations between its residential areas and those of working class whites and African Americans.

During World War II, the military built Sedalia Glider Base in Johnson County to the west. After the war, this facility was transferred to the Strategic Air Command. It was converted to a bomber base, the Whiteman Air Force Base, named after 2nd Lt. George A. Whiteman, an Army Air Corps pilot who was killed during the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. After a massive construction program, the base became the center of 150 ICBM silos and administrative offices. These were decommissioned in the 1990s.

Sedalia is home to the nation&#x27;s first sheltered workshop, which opened in 1965.

The expansion of the railroad and cattle drives in the late 19th century brought many male laborers to the rough town on the frontier. It sparked the related rise of a notorious &quot;red light district&quot;, with numerous prostitutes who did business with the men in saloons and brothels, which also featured musical entertainments.

As more families settled in the area, they made the culture more stable, creating institutions such as schools and churches. In the late 20th century, structural changes in the railroads meant the loss of many industrial jobs, but the city has held on to a population close to its 1960 peak while developing new bases for the economy. The city is informally known as the &quot;Trailer Capital of the Midwest&quot;, due to the high number of trailer manufacturers and dealers in the area.

Residents have emphasized the colorful history of the town for heritage tourism, and identified many significant historic structures for state and national recognition.

According to &quot;The History of the Boy Scouts of America&quot; (William D. Murray, 1937), the first Boy Scout Troop in Missouri (and one of the first in the nation) was formed in Sedalia in 1909, a year before the national organization was officially chartered on February 8, 1910.

==Demographics==
Sedalia had a population of around 300 people in 1860, and what was described as a &quot;bona fide population&quot; of around 1,000 in 1865. Sedalia has recently become home to many immigrants from Russia or former Soviet bloc nations, who may account for up to 15% of the population. Most of the Russian and Ukrainian immigrants who live in Sedalia are members of one of the seven Pentecostal Churches there.

==Arts and culture==
===Carnegie Library===
The Sedalia Public Library was the first Carnegie Grant awarded in Missouri. The Board of Trustees received word of the $50,000 grant in the fall of 1899. After securing the property on which to build, and having gained voter approval of a tax to support the library, the Board laid the cornerstone in 1900. The building was completed in July 1901. Dedicated in 1901, the library is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Museums===
Sedalia is home to the Daum Museum of Contemporary Art, named after its primary benefactor, Sedalia radiologist and art collector Harold Daum. The museum, located on the State Fair Community College campus, is home to the works of many famous artists including Dale Chihuly (1941–), Sam Francis (1923–1994), Helen Frankenthaler (1928–), Sol LeWitt (1928–2007), Robert Motherwell (1915–1991), Julian Schnabel (1951–), and Andy Warhol (1928–1987).

The museum, designed by St. Louis-based Gunn &amp; Smith Architects, features three stories of gallery space—including a main gallery with a translucent clerestory, a cantilevered stairway, a two-story atrium, and an open-air sculpture court. It features both permanent displays as well as temporary displays from world-renowned artists.
Sedalia is also home to The Pettis County Museum and Historical Society, located at 228 Dundee Ave. The building was once a Jewish Synagogue and features many Historical artifacts from all periods of Pettis County history. It is currently open on Friday and Saturday from 1:00pm to 4:00pm, and by appointment at other times.

===State Fair===
Since 1901, the Missouri State Fair has been held in Sedalia every August, with the exception of 1943 and 1944 because of World War II. Many singers and actors make the annual trip to the fair. Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and other presidents have given speeches on the fairgrounds, though not during the State Fair.

In 1974, the Missouri State Fairgrounds was the site of the Ozark Music Festival, one of the largest but least remembered major music festivals of the 1970s. While the plan was for the pop/rock/bluegrass festival&#x27;s selling about 50,000 tickets, an influx of about 184,000 fans and many rock bands strained the capacity of the fairgrounds and the city. Some estimates put the crowd count at 350,000. It counts as one of the largest music events (Rock Festivals) in history. The festival, hosted by Wolfman Jack, took out a full-page ad in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and attracted people from outside the region.

The project was the brainchild of the Scout Commissioner of the (then) Kansas City Area Council, Kansas City businessman J.P. Whitaker.

One of the 200 replicas was donated to Sedalia; and it was installed at the County Courthouse.

===&quot;A Sedalia Christmas&quot;===
&quot;A Sedalia Christmas&quot; is a multi-media play written in celebration of the Christmas traditions and celebrations of Sedalia from 1866 to 1969. It was written by Rebecca Imhauser, a Sedalia native. Local actors and actresses portray Sedalians and the events that shaped their lives. Historic photos are projected during the play to represent pivotal time frames, with an emphasis on Christmas during the depression and World War II eras. Sedalia&#x27;s Christmas heritage is celebrated through favorite holiday and patriotic songs, as well as choreographed dance numbers. This musical is set in Sedalia. Imhauser, a member of the Board of the Liberty Center Arts Association, created the show in 2008, basing it on her own knowledge, extensive research of Sedalia&#x27;s history and from her book &quot;All Along Ohio Street&quot;. The musical was first performed in the Liberty Center, a theater in downtown Sedalia, on December 5, 2008. It was shown again in December 2009 with an improved script and a slightly altered cast.

===Film===
The 1948 film &quot;Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!&quot; premiered at Fox Theatres. The premiere was attended by Lon McCallister, Colleen Townsend, Luanne Hogan and Betty Ann Lynn. A crowd of over 10,000 gathered to watch the celebrities paraded through downtown Sedalia on a donkey cart.
In the American television movie &quot;The Day After&quot; (1983), aired by ABC, Sedalia is destroyed when the Soviet Union attacks the Minuteman II Missile silos around the area. At the time of the movie&#x27;s release, 150 of the missiles were located in the Sedalia area in underground silos. They had been sited there since activation in early 1964 of the first Minuteman missiles under the control of the 351st Missile Wing located at Whiteman Air Force Base. The release of the movie led to a significant (if belated) increase in local community concern about the missiles. Concern remained high until all the missiles were dismantled between 1992 and 1997 as a result of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty between the United States and Russia.

Sedalia was featured in two widely seen 1977 films: &quot;Heroes&quot;, starring Henry Winkler and Harrison Ford; and the made-for-TV movie &quot;Scott Joplin&quot;, starring Billy Dee Williams.

Sedalia was mentioned briefly in the motion picture &quot;MASH&quot;. Parts of the 1941 film &quot;Bad Men of Missouri&quot; are set in Sedalia. The city was mentioned in &quot;Old Yeller&quot;.

===Television===
The classic, long running Western series &quot;Rawhide&quot;, which ran on CBS from 1959 to 1966, featured Sedalia as a destination for cattle drives. It starred Eric Fleming as the trail boss, Gil Favor, and the emerging Clint Eastwood as the &quot;ramrod&quot; (i.e., second in charge), Rowdy Yates.
===Music===
Sedalia is well known as the adopted home of ragtime music&#x27;s most well known musician and stylist Scott Joplin. Joplin&#x27;s famous &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was named for a saloon in Sedalia. Sedalia was also the hometown to Joe Harris, vocalist and trombonist with Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and later MGM Studios.

In 1935, in the midst of the Great Depression, which affected Sedalia severely, Abe Rosenthal along with other music-loving residents formed the Sedalia Symphony Society and established a symphony orchestra, which, as the second oldest in Missouri, celebrated its 75th season in 2009–2010.

Sedalia has been the host to several rock and roll events, such as the Ozark Music Festival in 1974, and the Delicious Rox Festival in 2006.

<text>Doolittle is a city in Phelps County, Missouri, United States. The population was 564 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The town is named for Lt. General Jimmy Doolittle of World War II fame who bombed Tokyo in a daring raid, which helped to turn the tide of the war in the Pacific. The settlement was originally called Centertown because it was halfway between Rolla and Newburg. This name, coined by a local man named Monroe Ramsey, caught on over the years.

The town boomed in the spring of 1941 when construction of Fort Leonard Wood, 20 miles away, began in earnest due to the war effort. Thousands of workers poured in and slept anywhere they could. In some places, it was said beds never got cold because different shifts shared occupancy. So the two mile stretch which was unofficially called Centertown grew and boomed and a local businessman, Lou Hargis, felt it was time for an incorporated city. The idea of naming the new city after General Doolittle was well-received, along with the idea of having General Doolittle dedicate the town after the war effort.

The original trustees of the town when it was incorporated were Lou Hargis, Mr. Durham (principal of the Newburg High School), Bob Crain (an employee of the Missouri Bureau of Mines, resident of Rolla), and Ike Towell (operator of a local filling station and grocery store). They continued as interim trustees until April 1944 when a general election was held and a mayor and city officials elected. It was those five men who presented themselves at the courthouse &quot;to announce the birth of a town and give it a hero&#x27;s name.&quot;

In 1946, Lt. General Doolittle spoke at the dedication ceremony in which the town was christened in his honor. Doolittle flew his own B-25 into the airport in Vichy, fulfilling a promise he had made two years before.

==Geography==
Doolittle is located at the intersection of Missouri Route T and I-44 between Rolla and Jerome. Newburg lies approximately 2.5 miles south on Route T.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Newburg is a city in Phelps County, Missouri, United States. The population was 470 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Newburg was founded in 1883 by St. Louis – San Francisco Railway as a division point for the railroad, where engines would stop for repairs and to change crews. It is currently used heavily by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad as a maintenance stop, with a large supply of railroad materials along the double tracks.

Iron working was attempted twice in Newburg. Easy access to the railroad made heavy industry a viable business. Construction of the Ozark Iron Works began after 1867, but the business went bankrupt in 1877. The Knotwell Iron Company attempted to use the facilities in 1880, but quit shortly afterwards due to a severe drop in iron prices.

After World War II, the railway switched from coal to diesel engines, which could run much longer distances without refueling. The Newburg stop was closed in the 1960’s, removing the roundhouse, turntable, and freight yards. A single &quot;Frisco&quot; caboose remains near the old freight yards.

Missouri University of Science and Technology in nearby Rolla has planned and implemented many projects in the city of Newburg.

The Community Theater, Gourd Creek Cave Archeological Site, Onyx Cave, and Ozark Iron Furnace Stack are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Rolla () is a city in, and the county seat of, Phelps County, Missouri, United States. Its population in the 2020 United States Census was 19,943. It is approximately midway between St. Louis and Springfield along I-44. Its micropolitan statistical area consists of Phelps County, Missouri. Nearby is an inactive township (Rolla Township).

It is the home of the Missouri University of Science and Technology, well known for its many engineering departments and computer science department.

The headquarters of the Mark Twain National Forest is in Rolla. The city is also within the Ozark Highlands American Viticultural Area, with vineyards first established by Italian immigrants to the area.

==History==

The first European-American settlers in Phelps County arrived in the early 19th century, working as farmers and iron workers along the local rivers, such as the Meramec, the Gasconade, and the 
Little Piney. In 1842, John Webber built the first house in what became the City of Rolla. Nine years later, railroad contractor Edmund Ward Bishop, considered to be the founder of Rolla, settled in the area. The state officially established Rolla as a town in 1858.

Three stories account for how Rolla was named. One story, widely regarded as a folk legend, and acknowledged as such by the Phelps County Historical Society, arises from the competition between Rolla and neighboring Dillon, Missouri, to be designated the county seat. When Rolla was made the county seat in 1861, the residents of Dillon, having lost a round, were allowed to choose the name of the new city and named it Rolla, after a good-for-nothing hunting dog.

Another story came from a citizens&#x27; meeting about naming the town. Webber was said to prefer the name Hardscrabble (which was used to describe the soils in the region) and Bishop pushed for the name Phelps Center. George Coppedge, representing new settlers from North Carolina, wanted to name the community after Raleigh. Bishop broke the three-way tie by agreeing with Coppedge as long as the name was spelled properly for the region, Rolla.

But the one story that has some first hand evidence to back it up was that it was named after Rolla Rose of St. Louis. He and others traveled to the area in the 1840s on a hunting trip. He carved his name on a tree so that they would not get lost. His widow, Adeline Rose, related this story in the St. Louis Globe newspaper on July 19, 1903. 

With numerous settlers from the South, many residents of Rolla leaned toward the Confederacy during the American Civil War; however, the town was taken by Union forces in June 1861. They built two minor forts — Fort Wyman and Fort Dette — during their occupation. Rolla was also the location of Camp Glover and Camp Davies. From 1863 to 1865, Rolla was the regimental headquarters of the 5th Missouri State Militia.

For most of its history, Rolla has served as a transportation and trading center. In 1860, it became the western terminus of the first-constructed leg of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway, colloquially known as the &quot;Frisco Line&quot;. Today, the BNSF Railway directly runs through the town.

Rolla was also a regular stop along U.S. Route 66, as it is almost located exactly halfway between the larger cities of St. Louis and Springfield. Today, Interstate 44, U.S. Route 63, and Route 72 all run through Rolla.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Running through the city is the divide line that separates the vast Missouri watershed (via the Little Piney and the Gasconade) from the substantially smaller Meremec watershed (via the Bourbeuse).

<text>Louisiana is a city in Pike County, Missouri, United States. The population was 3,364 at the 2010 census. Louisiana is located in northeast Missouri, on the Mississippi River, south of Hannibal.

Louisiana is located at the junction of State Route 79 and US 54. The former follows the Mississippi River for most of its length from Hannibal to St. Charles County. The latter enters Louisiana from Illinois via the Champ Clark Bridge, named for a former US Speaker of the House from nearby Bowling Green.

==History==

The town was founded in 1816 by John Walter Basye and named after his daughter, Louisiana Basye. Other notable early residents were Samuel Caldwell and Joel Shaw, both of whom purchased land from Basye in 1818. All three properties became the original town plat and comprised mainly riverfront properties. Many of the town&#x27;s residents trace their ancestry to these town pioneers. Louisiana proved to be a profitable shipping point on the Mississippi River, and that wealth led to numerous substantial antebellum homes. Many of those remain and, along with the Georgia Street Historic District in downtown Louisiana, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources has noted that the town has &quot;the most intact Victorian Streetscape in the state of Missouri.&quot;

Louisiana is one of three communities forming the 50 Miles of Art corridor, linked by history, heritage and Route 79; Louisiana, Clarksville and Hannibal are home to many artists, crafts persons and artisans. The community is also home to the annual Louisiana Country Colorfest.

In 1946, the town was the site of a Fischer-Tropsch plant capable of producing liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Seven scientists brought into the United States by Operation Paperclip from Nazi Germany took part in the research.

Louisiana hopes to be part of the &quot;green energy&quot; revolution as a former ammonia plant has been converted for the study and production of synthetic fuels. The city is also the headquarters of Lens.com.

Louisiana is home to Pike County&#x27;s largest festival, the Louisiana Country Colorfest, which began in 1984. The event is held the third weekend in October and is attended by over 8,000 people annually.

In addition to the Georgia Street Historic District, the Charles Bacon House, Capt. George and Attella Barnard House, Bethel Chapel AME Church, City Market, Goodman-Stark House, Louisiana Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad Depot, Louisiana Public Library, North Third Street Historic District, Pike County Hospital, and Gov. Lloyd Crow Stark House and Carriage House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Farley is a village in Platte County, Missouri, within the United States, along the Platte River. The population was 269 at the 2010 census. It lies within the Kansas City metropolitan area.

==History==
A post office called Farley has been in operation since 1852. The community has the name of Joseph Farley, the original owner of the land where the village now is located.

In Farley on August 20, 1900, Sheriff John H. Dillingham responded to a double homicide with two deputies. On Main Street, Sheriff John Dillingham encountered the murderer, Dr. Sterling Price Harrington who was the town&#x27;s doctor. Dr. Harrington and Sheriff Dillingham were friends and related by marriage. Dr. Harrington, who had murdered his mother-in-law and uncle-in-law the day before, was at Farley General store attempting to purchase more ammunition. He did not have enough money and attempted a robbery of the store. The general store owner pulled out a pistol and shots were exchanged between them. The clerk ran out of bullets and dropped his weapon saying he was shot. Dr. Harrington then left the store through the front door. There he encountered Sheriff Dillingham. Gunshots were exchanged and Dr. Harrington shot the Sheriff in the head, killing him instantly. The doctor then stepped over the sheriff&#x27;s lifeless body. The sheriff’s twenty-three-year-old son Henry, a deputy, returned fire fatally wounding Dr. Harrington.

This incident and the murders of Dr. Harrington&#x27;s in-laws were witnessed by Dr. Harrington&#x27;s 10-year-old daughter Maude, as the doctor had his daughter with him during his murderous rampage. The doctor was believed to be intoxicated and on drugs during the crime spree. The doctor was looking for his wife who had sought safety in Platte City, Mo. Deputy Sheriff Henry Dillingham was appointed as Sheriff to fill his father’s unexpired term. Henry Dillingham 30 years later became a U.S. Marshall. Sheriff John Dillingham was the first and the only Platte County Sheriffs Office law enforcement officer to be killed in the line-of-duty as of January 26, 2021.

The General Store where this incident took place was razed many years ago but there is a plaque erected marking this incident at the old store&#x27;s location on Main Street near the current post office. The plaque was erected by the Platte County Historical Society.

Another suggested theory of origin is related to a story about a discharged US Army dragoon by the name of Joseph Moore. He bought the land and then had First Sergeant Tom Weston of D Company, First Dragoons, stationed at Fort Leavenworth across the Missouri River, lay out a town plan. The town may have therefore been named for Sgt. Weston.

William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody was at one time a resident of Weston, and the town was a major &quot;jumping off&quot; point for the Santa Fe Trail, the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush.

In 1881, Weston was the site of the lynching of the biracial Charles Reese after he was accused of the rape and murder of the sixteen-year-old Nancy Stillwell.

Weston was, at one time, the second largest port on the Missouri River, surpassing both Kansas City and St. Joseph and at one point shortly after its founding, claimed to be the second largest city in Missouri. In 1850, over 265 steamboats a year docked at the Port of Weston. A flood in 1881 shifted the river into an old channel some two miles away.

The Weston Brewing Company was first established in 1842
by German immigrant John Georgian, and was one of the first lager beer breweries in the U.S. Five arched, limestone cellars, dug to a depth of 55 feet below ground, were constructed to create the ideal conditions for Georgian&#x27;s lager beer, which needed to be stored below 60 degrees. The brewery closed in 1919 when Prohibition was signed into law. In 2005, the Weston Brewing Company reopened and one of the cellars now houses a unique bar which requires patrons to descend down through a small rock faced tunnel to get to the large, cool, cavern like bar.

The McCormick Distillery, Missouri District Warehouse, Pleasant Ridge United Baptist Church, Sugar Creek Site, and Weston Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
Bolivar began as a settlement around Keeling Spring, with the majority of settlers being from Hardeman County, Tennessee. The settlement became part of Greene County, Missouri when that county was organized in 1833. After the northern part of Greene County was ceded to form Polk County, Missouri, the Polk County Court proclaimed the settlement as a city, named it Bolivar, and designated it as the county seat on 10 November 1835. Bolivar was re-organized as a fourth-class city on 15 February 1881. Bolivar was a full Stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail Period 1858-1861 at the old Franklin Hotel and Relay Station.
The town layout was along the Boonville road that was the main road through the area during that time. 
Bolivar experienced growth in 1884 when the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway was extended to that point.

The name &quot;Bolivar&quot; was proposed by John Polk Campbell and his brothers William St. Clair and Ezekiel Madison. It is named after Bolivar, Tennessee, where their grandfather and Continental Army Colonel Ezekiel Polk had lived. In the 1830s, Polk and Bolivar names were locally associated with liberation. As such, Bolivar, Missouri is an indirect namesake of Simón Bolívar.

The Bolivar Public Library, First National Bank, and North Ward School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Transportation==
Waynesville Regional Airport at Forney Field serves the community with air service; although it is on Fort Leonard Wood, it is jointly run by the cities of Waynesville and St. Robert and is available for civilian use by private pilots and scheduled commercial passenger service.

The major east–west route is Interstate 44; before that, the main highway was U.S. Route 66, which still exists as a scenic route through the area and passes through Devil&#x27;s Elbow, St. Robert, Waynesville, Buckhorn, and Hazelgreen. Names for Route 66 vary - at different places, it is called Teardrop Road, Highway Z, Old Route 66, Historic Route 66, and Highway 17. State-posted signs mark most of the alignment of the road.

Major north–south routes near Crocker include:

* Route 133 runs north from Interstate 44, exit 145, approximately two miles east of Hazelgreen to Richland, Swedeborg, Crocker, and about two miles west of Dixon, then north out of the county.
* Route 17 crosses Interstate 44 at exit 153 at Buckhorn, runs east through Waynesville, turns north to Crocker, and then runs north out of the county to Iberia. South of Interstate 44, Route 17 hugs the western edge of Fort Leonard Wood, passes near Laquey, and circles south of the post until it runs out of the county and eventually joins Highway 32 in Roby.
* Missouri Route T runs north from Route 17 at Waynesville to Swedeborg, where it meets and ends at Highway 133, about halfway between Richland and Crocker.

==Transportation==
Waynesville Regional Airport at Forney Field serves the community with air service; although it is on Fort Leonard Wood, it is jointly run by the cities of Waynesville and St. Robert and is available for civilian use by private pilots and scheduled commercial passenger service.

The major east-west route is Interstate 44; before that, the main highway was &quot;U.S. Route 66&quot;, which still exists as a scenic route through the area and passes through Devil&#x27;s Elbow, St. Robert, Waynesville, Buckhorn, and Hazelgreen. Names for U.S. Route 66 vary - at different places, it is called Teardrop Road, Highway Z, Old Route 66, Historic Route 66, and Highway 17. State-posted signs mark most of the alignment of the road.

Major north-south routes near St. Robert include:

* Route 28 which crosses Interstate 44 at exit 163 at the eastern edge of St. Robert, runs north through Dixon, and then runs north out of the county.
* A secondary road parallels Highway 28, beginning as Highway Y at exit 161 of Interstate 44 in St. Robert, running north to the Gasconade River bridge, where it becomes the county-maintained Cave Road and turning north as Highway O until it meets Missouri 28, a few miles south of Dixon.

== Politics ==

===Local===

St. Robert has a mayor and eight aldermen, each elected for two-year terms. The city has four wards with two aldermen elected from each ward in staggered terms so one alderman from each ward stands for election each year while the mayor is elected citywide. As with most other Missouri cities, elections are held in April.

Non-elected senior positions include Interim City Administrator Anita Ivey. Municipal Judge Tom Julian was re-elected in April 2009 to the position he had held for many years; the city council subsequently converted the municipal judge position to an appointed rather than an elected position and reappointed Julian to the position. Following Julian&#x27;s death, Bill Hardwick, an assistant prosecuting attorney working under County Prosecutor Kevin Hillman, a former St. Robert city attorney, was appointed to fill the position. Bill Hardwick vacated position, Ernest W. Tanner now fills this position.

Hillman and former Ward II Alderman Gene Newkirk both left city government following the results of the August 2010 elections. Hillman was elected as the Pulaski County Prosecuting Attorney; Newkirk was elected the Pulaski County Presiding Commissioner.

The following chart reflects the city&#x27;s elected officials following the April 2014 municipal election in which incumbent Larry Jackson was defeated by challenger Theresa Cook, herself a former alderman who was defeated for re-election several years earlier. Reggie Hall was appointed to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of Butchy Newkirk and George Lauritson, himself a former mayor, ran unopposed for a seat when Freda Hunnicutt decided not to run for re-election. The positions remained unchanged in the 2013 municipal election from those who had been elected in 2014.

== Media ==

Pulaski County historically had one daily and three weekly print newspapers, as well as an online internet daily newspaper. All but the weekly Dixon Pilot and the online Pulaski County Daily News are now closed. The county also has an internet discussion site, the Pulaski County Insider.

KFBD-FM and its AM sister station, KJPW, are the dominant news radio providers in the Pulaski County area, which includes Fort Leonard Wood, Waynesville, and St. Robert. These stations compete with the only other station broadcasting from Pulaski County, KFLW Radio.

&quot;The Daily Guide&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Waynesville Daily Guide&quot;, but based in St. Robert and serving the entire county, closed in September 2018. It was owned by GateHouse Media and was the central printing plant for three other GateHouse newspapers in nearby counties, the daily Camden &quot;Lake Sun Leader&quot; and &quot;Rolla Daily News&quot; as well as the weekly &quot;St. James Leader-Journal&quot;. The Rolla Daily News and the St. James weekly have since closed as well.

The content of the now-closed weekly Fort Leonard Wood Guidon was previously produced under the auspices of Army Public Affairs at Fort Leonard Wood but printed under contract by the Springfield News-Leader, a Gannett-owned newspaper which produced and sold advertisements in the Fort Leonard Wood Guidon. The military contract to produce the Guidon was held by the Lebanon Daily Record until the end of 2002, and before the Lebanon Daily Record had been held by the Waynesville Daily Guide for many years.

The weekly Pulaski County Mirror closed in February 2017 and had been owned by the Lebanon Daily Record, a family owned newspaper in an adjoining county. The paper is a merger of the Richland Mirror and Pulaski County Democrat in St. Robert, which were separate weekly papers owned by the Lebanon Daily Record until their owner merged them in 2009.

The Pulaski County Daily News internet newspaper is privately owned by a Waynesville resident.

The Pulaski County Insider is run and maintained by a businessman from St. Robert and hosted by a Potosi resident.

The other weekly paper in Pulaski County, the Dixon Pilot, does not routinely cover St. Robert.

== Education==

St. Robert residents attend the Waynesville R-VI School District.

Names for U.S. Route 66 vary - at different places, it&#x27;s called Teardrop Road, Highway Z, Old Route 66, Historic Route 66, and Highway 17. State-posted signs mark most of the alignment of the road.

The major north–south routes near Waynesville are:

* Route 17 which crosses Interstate 44 at exit 153 at Buckhorn, runs east through Waynesville, turns north to Crocker, and then runs north out of the county to Iberia. South of Interstate 44, Highway 17 hugs the western edge of Fort Leonard Wood, passes near Laquey, and circles south of the post until it runs out of the county and eventually joins Highway 32 in Roby.
* Highway T which runs north from Highway 17 at Waynesville to Swedeborg, where it meets and ends at Highway 133 about halfway between Richland and Crocker.

Major attractions along U.S. Route 66 include the Old Stagecoach Stop in downtown Waynesville, which is now a museum but began as a tavern and boarding house and is the oldest standing structure in the county. It was used as a Civil War hospital for Union troops who were garrisoned above the city in Fort Wayne, which was demolished after the war. The Old Courthouse Museum in downtown Waynesville is near the Old Stagecoach Stop.

The City Of Waynesville does not provide any public transportation (such as buses or shuttles).

== Media ==

KFBD-FM and its AM sister station, KJPW, are the dominant news radio providers in the Pulaski County area, which includes Fort Leonard Wood, Waynesville and St. Robert. These stations compete with the only other station broadcasting from Pulaski County, KFLW Radio, previously owned by the &quot;Lebanon Daily Record&quot; and working locally from the St. Robert offices of the &quot;Pulaski County Mirror&quot; weekly newspaper.

The &quot;Pulaski County Daily News&quot; online newspaper is privately owned by a Waynesville resident.

The &quot;Pulaski County Insider&quot; is run and maintained by a businessman from St. Robert and hosted by a Potosi resident.

The county&#x27;s weekly paper, &quot;the Dixon Pilot&quot;, does not routinely cover Waynesville.

Pulaski County historically had one daily and three weekly print newspapers, as well as an online internet daily newspaper. All but the weekly Dixon Pilot and the online Pulaski County Daily News are now closed. The county also has an internet discussion site, the Pulaski County Insider.

The Daily Guide, commonly known as the Waynesville Daily Guide, but based in St. Robert and serving the entire county, closed in September 2018. It was owned by GateHouse Media and was the central printing plant for three other GateHouse newspapers in nearby counties, the daily Camden Lake Sun Leader and Rolla Daily News as well as the weekly St. James Leader-Journal. The Rolla Daily News and the St. James weekly have since closed as well.

The content of the now-closed weekly Fort Leonard Wood Guidon was previously produced under the auspices of Army Public Affairs at Fort Leonard Wood but printed under contract by the Springfield News-Leader, a Gannett-owned newspaper which produced and sold advertisements in the Fort Leonard Wood Guidon. The military contract to produce the Guidon was held by the Lebanon Daily Record until the end of 2002, and before the Lebanon Daily Record had been held by the Waynesville Daily Guide for many years.

The weekly Pulaski County Mirror closed in February 2017 and had been owned by the Lebanon Daily Record, a family owned newspaper in an adjoining county. The paper is a merger of the Richland Mirror and Pulaski County Democrat in St. Robert, which were separate weekly papers owned by the Lebanon Daily Record until their owner merged them in 2009.

<text>Huntsville is a city in and the county seat of Randolph County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,376 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Randolph County was organized February 2, 1829, and Huntsville was established as the county seat in 1831. Daniel Hunt, a Kentuckian, was the first settler of Huntsville, in honor of whom the town was named. He settled here between 1820 and 1821. He was soon followed by William Goggin, Gideon Wright and Henry Winburn, also from Kentucky. William Goggins established a mill here, the first in the county. They entered the land from the government upon which Huntsville is located and donated 50 acres for a town site, giving 12 1/2 acres each forming an exact square, the dome of the court house being the center.

The Randolph County Courthouse houses the following county governmental offices: Assessor, Randolph County Commissioners, Collector, Recorder of Deeds, Treasurer and County Clerk. The first courthouse was built in the center of the public square at the precise meeting point of the four parcels of land; it was completed by June 13, 1831. It was razed in either 1858 or 1859. The next courthouse stood on the same site between 1858 and 1882, being expanded and remodeled in 1877 by architect Charles B. Clarke. On August 12, 1882, a fire consumed the courthouse. The third courthouse was completed in April 1884. Another fire occurred in July 1955. The current courthouse stands in the same location as the original court building.

In 1838, the Potawatomi Indians passed near Huntsville on the Trail of Death. A marker was dedicated on September 11, 1997, with Potawatomi descendants present. It reads as thus: &quot;On October 17 and 18, 1838, about 850 Potawatomi Indians camped near Huntsville, on their way from northern Indiana to Kansas; a forced march accompanied by soldiers. Having travelled 13 miles in cold, rain, a flooded camp caused them to stay a second day.&quot; The marker is located on the front lawn of the Randolph County Courthouse.

The Huntsville Historical Society was chartered on June 19, 1973. The Society and friends support and maintain a Museum which opened in 1975 in the old Westlake Hardware store in downtown Huntsville on Main Street. The Museum is available to the public with the mission to collect, preserve and disseminate historical information about Huntsville. The Society supports other community projects as well.

Huntsville is home to both the Westran Elementary School and Westran High School. The Westran High School is home to the Westran Hornets and Lady Hornets. Students are offered participation in football, basketball, softball, baseball, track, golf, cheerleading, as well as other sports.

The Huntsville Lincoln School was built on Randolph Street and provided education for African-American children from first to eighth grade. Later the ninth and tenth grades were added. About 1935, pupils were transported to the Moberly Lincoln High School for the eleventh and twelfth grades. This continued until the schools were integrated in the early 1960s.

During the mid-19th century, Huntsville was also the home to Mount Pleasant College. A charter was granted and the cornerstone was laid and work began on Mount Pleasant College in 1855.

<doc id="123083" wikidata="Q953399" url="?curid=123083" title="Hardin, Missouri">
<text>Hardin is a city in southeast Ray County, Missouri, and part of the Kansas City metropolitan area within the United States. The population was 571 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Hardin was laid out in 1868. The community was named for Charles Henry Hardin, 22nd Governor of Missouri. A post office called Hardin has been in operation since 1858.

===1993 floods===
Hardin and its cemetery were affected by the Great Flood of 1993, due to their location near the Missouri River. On July 12, 1993 a levee protecting the town of Hardin broke, flooding the city and the cemetery. The flood waters cut a pond thru the cemetery and swept away 793 burials. Later, under the leadership of Dean Snow, 645 remains were recovered, but most were unidentified. Some were still inside their vaults or caskets (thus helping making identification easier), while others were scattered in the open. Since DNA testing was still in its infancy, bodies and bones had to be identified by the rate of decay, sex, age range, dental records and family recollections. Of the bodies recovered, only 120 were identified and reburied with their original headstones. The remaining 525 bodies were unidentified. Some had decayed to the point that they were unrecognizable, others were too old to have any surviving records or relatives. The unidentified bodies were reburied in a mass grave in part of a 9.5 acre plot of land that was purchased by the cemetery after the 1993 flood. The unidentified were marked with a headstone listing them as unknown and a number, so in case the bodies were to be disturbed again by another flood or if authorities wanted to try to identify them with newer technology or DNA testing in the future. A memorial was added to the western entrance of the cemetery in 1994 to honor the 1993 flood and the unidentified bodies. Part of the newly acquired acre of land was also used to display the recovered headstones of those whose bodies were not identified. They today function as a Cenotaph for the unidentified bodies so living family members can still pay respects. The rest was used to rebury the 120 identified bodies and for new burials. In 1995, a second memorial was added near the mass grave displaying the names, birth and death years of the displaced bodies that could not be identified. Today, the cemetery is 18.5 acres large, including the pond.

<text>Doniphan is a city and the county seat of Ripley County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,781 at the 2020 census. 

==History== 
The first settlement at Doniphan was made in the 1840s. The community was named for Alexander William Doniphan. A post office called Doniphan has been in operation since 1848.

=== Early years ===
The earliest recorded permanent settlement in the area that would become Doniphan was that of Lemuel Kittrell in 1819. Kittrell built a grist and wood mill near his home that attracted additional settlers to the region. By 1841, the Kittrell settlement had grown to a sizeable village that included an inn, store, distillery, produce warehouse, tannery, justice of the peace and notary office, blacksmith, and a gunsmith.

The town of Doniphan was founded in 1847. Due to most of the population of Ripley County being concentrated in the southern half of the county, the county seat was moved from Van Buren to Doniphan the same year.

=== Civil War ===
Most residents of Southeast Missouri identified as southerners and sympathized with, or fought for, the Confederacy. During the winter of 1861-1862, the combination of harsh conditions and numerous skirmishes ruined crops and many families suffered. The residents of Doniphan were promised protection by Captain W. T. Leeper if they remained loyal to the Union, but the residents were mostly rebel sympathizers.

In 1862, Reverend Timothy Reeves, a Baptist minister in Doniphan, formed Reeves&#x27;s Independent Company of Missouri Scouts, a militia group under the command of Confederate General John Sappington Marmaduke. On April 1, 1862, a skirmish lasting two days took place at the Doniphan Ford on Current River. Union forces were led by Captain Leeper, while pro-Confederate forces were led by Reverend Reeves. The skirmish resulted in many killed, wounded, or captured for both sides.

In 1863, Reeves combined his Independent Scouts with another militia group to form the 15th Missouri Cavalry Regiment, CSA.

In 1864, Union troops entered Doniphan and burned most of the town, including the wooden courthouse.

As of 1900, Doniphan was a sundown town that prohibited African Americans from living there.

==Geography==
Doniphan is located in south-central Ripley County at the intersection of US Route 160 and Missouri Route 142. The Current River flows past the west side of the city.

<text>Arrow Rock is a village in Saline County, Missouri, United States, located near the Missouri River. The entire village is part of the National Historic Landmark Arrow Rock Historic District, designated by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service in 1963. It is significant in the history of Westward Expansion, the Santa Fe Trail, and 19th-century artist George Caleb Bingham. The town is well known for the Arrow Rock Lyceum Theatre, hosting over 33,000 patrons every year.

The first state-designated historic site is located here. Restoration of a 19th-century tavern in 1923 marked the beginning of historic preservation in Missouri. Many structures within the village are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Several locations are also certified sites of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and the Santa Fe National Historic Trail.

The village retains much of its 19th-century Boonslick character, and it attracts more than 100,000 visitors per year. Given the importance of heritage tourism to the village&#x27;s economy, architectural ordinances implemented in 2004 provide guidance for both new construction and restorations of existing structures.

The town has numerous bed and breakfast establishments, and a modern campground nearby is maintained by the Missouri Division of State Parks. Local government consists of an elected five-member Board of Trustees. The Trustees elect their chair person (mayor).

== History ==

Arrow Rock was the name of a prominent flint-bearing bluff on the Missouri River. The name first appeared on a French map from 1732 as &quot;Pierre a Fleche&quot;, meaning &quot;Rock of Arrows&quot;. Edwin James on the 1819 Yellowstone Expedition wrote, &quot;Arrow Rock is so called from its having been formerly resorted to by neighboring Indians for the stone used to point their arrows.&quot; The two dominant Native American tribes in the area encountered by French traders early in the 18th century were the Missouria and the Osage.

The bluff continued to be a landmark to explorers and travelers for over 150 years. Lewis and Clark passed by on June 9, 1804, and noted &quot;Several small Channels running out of the River below a Bluff [Cliff of rocks called the arrow rock] &amp; Prairie (Called the Prairie of Arrows)&quot;. In 1808, William Clark passed through the area again on his way to construct Fort Osage noting a &quot;Big Arrow Rock&quot; and a &quot;Little Arrow Rock&quot; just upstream from it. He declared the area would &quot;make a handsome spot for a town.&quot;

During the first half of the 19th century, this region of central Missouri was called &quot;Boonslick Country&quot; so named for the Boone&#x27;s salt lick about four miles east of Arrow Rock in adjacent Howard County. The term &quot;lick&quot; derived from wildlife licking salt from the ground around the briny springs. Nathan and Daniel Morgan Boone, sons of famed frontiersman Daniel Boone, manufactured salt here from 1805 to 1812, shipping it to St. Louis. Their partners and co-operators, James and Jesse Morrison, continued the salt business until 1833. Salt boiling continued intermittently until the 1860s. The site of this early frontier industry is now managed as Boone&#x27;s Lick State Historic Site by the Missouri Division of State Parks.

Euro-American settlers arrived in 1810, establishing small settlements several miles to the north and to the south of the Arrow Rock bluff and in the river bottoms on the opposite side of the Missouri River. During the War of 1812, these settlers built small defensive forts as protection from Ioway, Sac &amp; Fox Indians allied to Great Britain. When Fort Osage closed in 1813, the fort&#x27;s factor (trader) George C. Sibley moved his operation to the Arrow Rock bluff during the winter of 1813–1814 to carry on trade with the Osage Indians. This helped maintain their loyalty the United States during the war.

By 1815, a ferry was established at the site of Arrow Rock. Westbound settlers poured into the area, crossing the Missouri River on the Arrow Rock ferry. Santa Fe trading caravans departing from Franklin began crossing at the ferry in 1821. From 1819 to 1833, the ferry was owned by Judge David Todd, the uncle of Mary Todd Lincoln. Judge William B. Napton noted that 1827 was an especially busy year for the ferry as the population of Saline County swelled that year. In 1849 and 1850 the covered wagons of emigrants to California &quot;were hardly ever out of sight at Arrow Rock.&quot; Several Arrow Rock residents continued to be involved in the Santa Fe trade as late as the beginning of the Civil War, 1861.

The town was founded in June 1829 and originally called &quot;Philadelphia&quot;. Some documents refer to it as &quot;New Philadelphia&quot;. However, in 1833 the state legislature changed the name because the locale was better known as &#x27;Arrow Rock&#x27;. Joseph Huston, one of the town commissioners, built a two-story brick building in 1834. Due to Arrow Rock&#x27;s location on the Missouri River and along the Santa Fe Trail, travelers undoubtedly asked Huston for overnight accommodations. He began building frame or log additions to the brick building and by 1840 was widely known as a hotel-keeper. The J. Huston Tavern also housed a store and a ballroom used for dances and a meeting hall. As the building passed to other owners, it became known as the Neill House, Scripture House, City Hotel and Old Tavern. The J. Huston Tavern houses the oldest continuously operating restaurant west of the Mississippi and is today operated by the Missouri Division of State Parks in partnership with the Friends of Arrow Rock, Inc.

Settlers in the Arrow Rock area were predominantly migrants from the Upper South of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. They brought slaves and southern culture with them. The town developed as a thriving river port, exporting tobacco and hemp from plantations in the region. Hemp was the most important cash crop in Saline County. Before the Civil War, hemp was made into ropes and bags for baling cotton. Wheat, corn, beef, pork and mules were also shipped from Arrow Rock to supply the cotton districts of the Mississippi delta. The agricultural production of the Boonslick Country depended on slave labor just as cotton production did in the South. This symbiotic relationship led most residents of Arrow Rock and the Boonslick Country to support the South during the Civil War. Saline County and other Missouri counties with a high population of enslaved African Americans later became identified as “Little Dixie.” According to historian Dr. Christopher Phillips, Arrow Rock represented a unique blending of western frontier idealism and southern traditions.

During the town&#x27;s early decades, it was the site of a slave market, and the auction block continued to stand on the river bluff in front of the J. Huston Tavern for many decades after the Emancipation Proclamation and the U.S. victory in the Civil War eradicated human enslavement. Because of the slave market&#x27;s prominence, the large bend in the Missouri River below the town was known as &quot;N***** Bend.&quot;

Arrow Rock&#x27;s population peaked at 1,000 by 1860. Even as late as 1872, the town was considered one of the busiest river ports between St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri. During the Civil War there were no major battles in the area, but guerrilla raids and murders disrupted agricultural production and river commerce. Union militia enforced martial law on the town during most of the war. Town government conducted little business in 1861 and 1862 and did not convene at all from 1863 to 1865. The population began to decline after the war and railroads began supplanting steamboat commerce. Arrow Rock failed in its bids to secure a rail line and a bridge across the Missouri River. The rapid post war growth of urban areas such as Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago began drawing away residents with the promise of better jobs. The town was swept by disastrous fires in 1864, 1872 and 1901. By the turn of the 20th century the population had declined to around 300.

Prior to the Civil War, Arrow Rock&#x27;s black residents worked as household or domestic slaves or as laborers at the docks and business warehouses. Many were skilled tradesmen who were rented out by their masters to business contractors. Much of the town&#x27;s infrastructure such as the massive stone gutters lining Main Street, were built by enslaved African-Americans. Following emancipation in 1865, Arrow Rock&#x27;s African-American population grew as former plantation slaves moved into town. Gradually they were able to purchase their own homes, mostly on the north side of town. By 1880, 51% of the town&#x27;s population was African-American. Owing to segregation of the time, they had to develop their own churches, schools and social institutions. The last black resident of the community died in 2009.

Arrow Rock&#x27;s connection with the Santa Fe Trail led to national recognition by the Old Trails Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) in 1912. As DAR interest in the community grew, they persuaded the Missouri legislature to purchase and preserve the &quot;Old Tavern&quot; (J. Huston Tavern) in 1923. Acreage around the Tavern was purchased as a state park. This was the beginning of publicly funded historic preservation in Missouri and one of the first units of the new Missouri State Park system. The park grew to 169 acres, about a third of which lies within town boundaries. In 1976 the facilities designation was changed from park to historic site to better reflect its cultural mission.

The Friends of Arrow Rock, Inc., formed in 1959 to help preserve historic structures outside the state historic site boundary. They give guided tram tours of town from April though October and work closely with Arrow Rock State Historic in conducting education and interpretive programs about the village.

==Town ordinances==
December 23, 1847, Article 6 of Laws for Conducting Town Meetings; &quot;It shall be the duty of all members of said Board of Trustees to be present at every meeting, and for failing so to do, shall forfeit and pay the sum of fifty cents, unless excused from said fine, upon a reasonable cause given for said absentee absence.&quot;

January 1849 “Be it ordained &amp;c that any one guilty of fighting, or loud and boisterous quarrelling, or engaging in any mob, or making unusual noises, furious or violent riding within the corporation, upon conviction before a magistrate shall be fined in any sum not less than two dollars and fifty cents and not more than twenty dollars.&quot;

March 28, 1850 &quot;It was resolved that Benjamin Hawpe be appointed Captain of Patrol and that William Parks, E. K. Chase &amp; William H. McCowan be and are hereby appointed patrols for the Town of Arrow Rock for six months from date whose duty it shall be to guard the Town and prevent the unlawful meeting of Negroes and see that no Negro is out from home after nine o’clock at night without a pass and if so found shall be dealt with as the Law directs.&quot;

September 6, 1858, the Town Board ordained &quot;...that any person guilty of firing or setting off fire works, fire crackers or throwing turpentine [lighting then throwing it in the air] and gass balls [explosive carbide] ...shall on conviction be fined not less than one or more than five dollars for each offense.&quot;

March 10, 1868 &quot;Be it ordained from &amp; after this date by the trustees of the corporation of the town of Arrow Rock that all and any Billiard Table within the corporate limits of this town, or within one half a mile of the same shall pay an annual tax of Ten Dollars, tax, the same due semiannually in advance.&quot; The board apparently felt their authority extended beyond the corporation limits.

June 2, 1871, the Town Board acting on a complaint from Mr. L. D. Lindsey ordered the Constable to suppress the game of croquet because the players &quot;frequently indulge in profane and obscene language.&quot; The Board has never rescinded the order so modern day residents periodically will get up a game of &quot;outlaw croquet&quot; in town.

April 8, 1872, the Town Board “Ordered that the privy in rear of Levy Bros. Store be declared a nuisance, also D.D. Greens’ Cow-yard.”

==Archaeology==

Archaeologist Dr. Timothy E. Baumann McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture, University of East Tennessee began conducting surveys in 1995 to explore African-American life and culture from the slavery period through emancipation and into the early 20th century. He has led teams in excavating several households, a schoolhouse, a church, and a Masonic Lodge that were part of Arrow Rock&#x27;s African-American community. Dr. Baumann confirmed that the Masonic Lodge had been built over the site of the Caldwell Pottery Works, the third largest pottery works in Missouri during the 1850s and 1860s. Remains of a beehive kiln, outbuildings and thousands of shards of pottery and testing clay were uncovered. In 2005, the probable site of Sibley&#x27;s trading house for the Osage was surveyed, although few remains were found due to the temporary nature of the post and subsequent agricultural activities on the grounds. Dr. Baumann continues to serve as a museum consultant for Friends of Arrow Rock, Inc. He has also excavated slave quarters at two neighboring plantation sites, Prairie Park and Oak Grove.

Several excavations have been carried out on state historic site property. Archaeologists from the University of Missouri have conducted several surveys and excavations on the grounds identifying the remains of a 19th-century mercantile store, the town&#x27;s first public school and a livery stable. Larry Grantham and Brant Vollmann former archaeologists with the Missouri Division of State Parks have conducted limited excavations of a small 19th century store and the grounds around the Dr. Mathew W. Hall House and the J. Huston Tavern. Members of the Missouri Archaeological Society surface surveyed several empty town lots in 2016 and found evidence of 19th century businesses and warehouses. No evidence of a permanent Native American village has been located at Arrow Rock. However, evidence indicates the area had been a major manufacturing site for flint points dating back at least 10,000 years.

==Arts==
Arrow Rock&#x27;s tradition in the arts has its roots in the residency of George Caleb Bingham. He began painting portraits of local residents in 1833. His earliest extant portraits are those of Dr. John Sappington and Jane B. Sappington done in 1834. These two portraits along with a second set of portraits of Dr. and Mrs. Sappington he completed in 1844 an 1875 portrait of James M. Piper, several original lithographic prints and Bingham family memorabilia are on display at the Arrow Rock State Historic Site Visitors’ Center Museum.

Jane Froman (1907–1980) was a popular singer and actress during the 1930s through 1950s. She had her own television show in the 1950s and was known for her charitable work with sick children. A native Missourian, she retired to Columbia Missouri. From 1969 through 1972 she did charitable work for a music camp to help children develop musical abilities. Established in the Old Schoolhouse of Arrow Rock, it was named as the Jane Froman Music Center. The center attracted nationally known artists to Arrow Rock for summer concerts and she performed Christmas concerts there. Although the music center closed in 1972, it gave impetus to development of other artistic venues in town.

The Arrow Rock Lyceum Theater was established in 1960 in the abandoned Baptist Church. Missouri&#x27;s oldest repertory theater, the Lyceum now produces Broadway caliber musicals and plays from June through September with special holiday productions in December. Actors come from as far away as New York and California and audiences are drawn from across Missouri. A 408-seat auditorium was added in 1995 and the old church building itself now serves as the box office and concession area.

In 1973, a musical version of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; was filmed here. The movie, &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, starred Johnny Whitaker as Tom, Jeff East as Huckleberry Finn, Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly, Warren Oates as Muff Potter and Jodie Foster in her third movie role, as Becky Thatcher. Many of the town&#x27;s buildings and landscapes are recognizable in the film. The following year, Jeff East reprised his role in &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; which was partially filmed here. Paul Winfield co-starred as Jim and comedian Harvey Korman as The King. On July 4, 2007, the town also celebrated the 35th anniversary of the film. One hundred people participated in a parade and well over 2,000 spectators lined Main Street from the old schoolhouse to Second Street. Johnny Whitaker, Jeff East and Celeste Holm served as parade marshals and shared their fond memories of making the film with the crowd, and renewed acquaintances they had made with local residents during filming.

In addition to being the home of the Lyceum Theatre, Arrow Rock continues its tradition of supporting the arts by periodically hosting art and crafts shows and workshops and special concerts throughout the year. The second full weekend of each October the town hosts the Fall Heritage Festival hosting a wide variety of craftspeople, artisans, reenactors and musical entertainment.

==Parks and public lands==
Established in 1923, Arrow Rock State Historic Site is administered by the Missouri Division of State Parks. It was one of the first three units to come into the Missouri state park system. The 169 acre site overlooks the Missouri valley and encompasses about one-fourth of the village. The site contains a large visitor center/museum complex, four acre fishing lake, picnic area with a playground, 1 ½ miles of hiking trails and a 48 unit campground with modern amenities.

The state historic site is adjacent to the 1,871 acre Jameson Island Unit of the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, administered by the United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. Established in 1994 following the disastrous flood of 1993, the wetlands and waterways of the refuge provides critical habitat for endangered species such as pallid and lake sturgeon. The refuge also benefits numerous other wildlife species. The area has seen the resurgence in deer, turkey, beaver and otter populations. Species that were absent such as bobcats, Mississippi kites, bald eagles and pileated woodpeckers have returned in recent years. The refuge has minimal development and offers opportunities for hiking and bird watching. Hunting and fishing are also permitted in accordance with state regulations.

* Old Schoolhouse (1923) The white public school was built on this site in 1892 but burned in 1910. The second building burned in 1923 and was replaced with the current structure. The school closed due to consolidation in 1954. The building now houses village government offices and the Stolberg-Jackson Community Center.
* Federated Church (1852) Originally the Methodist Episcopal Church, this church still has an active congregation.
* Zion Church (1870) The congregation is no longer active and the building now serves as the Masonic Lodge Hall No. 55
* African Public School (1948) The black school was first built in 1892 from materials salvaged from the white public school when it was torn down and moved.

<text>Marshall is a city in Saline County, Missouri, United States. The population was 13,806 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Saline County. The Marshall Micropolitan Statistical Area consists of Saline County. It is home to Missouri Valley College.

==History==

Sixty-five acres of land for the city of Marshall was donated by Jeremiah O’Dell, deeded on April 13, 1839. It was named for the United States Supreme Court Chief Justice, John Marshall, when chosen for the county seat. After the first two courthouses in Marshall were lost to fires, the Saline County Courthouse was constructed in January 1882; it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The courthouse is an enduring landmark in the center of the Marshall Square, and a legacy of Nineteenth-Century architecture.

The Nicholas-Beazley Airplane Company was an American aircraft manufacturer headquartered in Marshall in the 1920s and 1930s. At its peak, the company produced as many as one aircraft per day. In 1937, production of aircraft ceased, due to economic pressures from the Great Depression. Today, the Nicholas Beazley Aviation Museum is located at the Marshall Airport, with artifacts of interest from aviation history. ConAgra Foods owns the property of the old Nicholas-Beazley Airplane Company factory building, located right off the Marshall square; the factory building was torn down in the summer of 2015 to expand the ConAgra plant.

Marshall is rich in music history. Marshall is the home of Bob James, the acclaimed jazz musician; the Foothills Fest Music Festival; The Marshall Municipal Band; and, notably, the Marshall Philharmonic Orchestra. The Orchestra performs every year for the public, free of charge, and has been featured in the Los Angeles Times in 2006 and on NBC&#x27;s American Almanac in December 1985, among other media outlets. The Philharmonic Orchestra has been performing for 52 years and counting. The Municipal Band has been performing for over 100 years and usually performs on the Courthouse lawn every Thursday evening during the summer months, filling the town square with music.

Marshall is also home to Jim the Wonder Dog. Jim earned his reputation as a &#x27;wonder dog&#x27; during the 1930s, puzzling psychologists from both Washington University in St. Louis and University of Missouri. Dr. A. J. Durant, director of the School of Veterinary Medicine, tested Jim&#x27;s abilities in a public demonstration. He concluded that Jim, &quot;possessed an occult power that might never come again to a dog in many generations.&quot; Jim seemed to have the ability to guess the sex of an unborn baby and answer to orders in many different languages even though his owner, Sam Van Arsdale, spoke only English. Jim the Wonder Dog picked the winner of the Kentucky Derby seven years in a row, and also predicted the Yankees&#x27; victory in the 1936 World Series. A joint session of the Missouri Legislature was called in order to witness the talents of Jim. He died March 18, 1937.

During the Civil War, Marshall was garrisoned by Union Troops. Although Marshall was strategically unimportant, the town was the victim of two Confederate raids and the site of the October 13, 1863 Battle of Marshall, the climax of Colonel J. O. Shelby&#x27;s 1863 &quot;Great Raid&quot;. Confronted by a larger force of 1,800 Federal troops and Missouri State Militia, Shelby broke through, divided his command and withdrew from Missouri. d.

Missouri Valley College was founded in Marshall in 1889. The history of Missouri Valley College began during a conference at Sarcoxie, Missouri, on October 27, 1874, where the representatives of the several Presbyterian synods in the state of Missouri met to discuss founding the school. The school was affiliated with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church for a long period.

The college&#x27;s original building, Baity Hall, was built in 1889, the year of the college&#x27;s founding, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Victorian Era building is notable for its beautiful wooden staircase, vaulted wooden ceilings, and stained glass windows. Missouri Valley College is a private, four-year liberal arts college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). The 150-acre (60.7 ha) campus is found within the city limits of Marshall. The college supports 27 academic majors and an enrollment close to 1,800 students. Missouri Valley College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, a Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.

In addition to Baity Hall, the Chicago and Alton Depot, First Presbyterian Church, Fitzgibbon Hospital, Free Will Baptist Church of Pennytown, Mt. Carmel Historic District, Saline County Courthouse, Utz Site, Van Meter State Park Combination Building, and Van Meter State Park Shelter Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Downing is a city in Schuyler County, Missouri, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 300. It is part of the Kirksville Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Although not being laid out as a town until 1872, the Downing area was one of the earliest settled areas of Schuyler County, with Henry Downing building a home and claiming land a few miles south of the area &quot;circa&quot; 1837. It was also near present-day Downing that the first school in the county was established. In the spring of 1841, a crude log cabin was built for use as a school near Henry Downing&#x27;s home and Miss Esther Hathaway was employed as a teacher. One of the early names for the unincorporated settlement was Cherry Grove.

During the Civil War, on July 1, 1862, a small skirmish took place near Cherry Grove. Cavalry from the second battalion, Eleventh Missouri State Militia, a pro-Union force, engaged a small number of Confederate troops under Colonel Joseph C. Porter. Porter&#x27;s outnumbered forces were defeated, with four killed and several men and horses captured. The Union forces had one man badly injured, who would die a few days later. At the time of the skirmish, Porter was heavily involved in recruiting men in northeast Missouri for the Confederate cause. The following month, he would suffer a larger defeat some twenty-five miles southwest at the Battle of Kirksville.

In September 1872, the Missouri Town Company created the original town plat, naming it for the president of the company, H. H. Downing. Land for the town, the railroad right of way, and depot were donated by James Prime, and the Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska Railway constructed the depot in April, 1872. By the late 1880s, the Downing business district included four general stores, two drug stores, two grocers, two hardware stores, a restaurant, blacksmith, and two hotels. Manufacturing included two handle factories, a wagon maker, a hoop factory, a harness and saddle maker, and two combination saw/grist mills. Downing had two tobacco-buying warehouses in the late 1800s, with both reporting extensive business. At its peak in 1902, over 155,000 pounds of tobacco were dealt through the Downing warehouses. The town&#x27;s location on the Keokuk &amp; Western railroad provided opportunity for the convenient shipment of goods, crops, and livestock from the Downing area.

The Downing Railroad Depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and now serves as a museum. The depot was moved approximately one-quarter mile from its original trackside location and now serves as the centerpiece of a city park with other nearby buildings, including the former Downing jail.

==Geography==

Downing is located at (40.487682, -92.368022).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The town has a lending library, the Chaffee Public Library.

==Economy==
For many years, the town&#x27;s economy was centered on textile manufacturing. Because large amounts of cotton are produced by southeast Missouri farmers, and owing to the town&#x27;s location near the Mississippi River, it made sense to process the cotton locally. However, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the town&#x27;s economy was devastated by factory closings. The Columbia Sportswear factory and the Florsheim Shoe Company announced that they were idling their plants and laying off workers. Nearly 450 jobs were lost in a period of six months. This was compounded by the closure of previous factories such as the Thorngate Clothing Company, which idled its plant in 1996. Out of a population of just 3000 people, this amounted to losing over 60% of the town&#x27;s employment base.

<text>Commerce is a Mississippi River village in Scott County, Missouri, United States. The population was 67 at the time of the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1788, the present site of Commerce was first occupied by French settlers, making Commerce apparently the third-oldest present-site settlement in Missouri after St Louis and St. Charles as Ste. Genevieve was moved from its original location. A trading post established in 1803 served as the center of commerce for the region, hence the name of the settlement. In 1823, the circuit court ordered a board of commissioners to be appointed to lay out lots here.

Commerce was one of the few areas in Scott County to have uninterrupted mail service during the Civil War, as guerilla bands elsewhere made delivery unsafe for the northern carriers. Commerce, along with the German settlement of New Hamburg, were the two enclaves of Union sympathizers in Scott County during the war. On November 1, 1861, Colonel Oglesby landed in Commerce with about 3,000 men, where his soldiers soon exchanged shots with M. Jeff Thompson — who raided the Commerce on December 29, 1861. On February 21, 1862, General Pope landed here with 140 troops, but when he left a week later his force consisted of 26,153 men. The island in front of Commerce was known as Cat Island at least as early as Mark Twain&#x27;s time; however, it has been absorbed by Powers Island to the south.

Scott County courthouse records were moved to a military post at Cape Girardeau during the Civil War. Around August 1863, the county seat of Scott County was informally moved to Commerce. On January 26, 1864, this move was made official by the legislature of Missouri. In 1864, a brick was built in Commerce for this purpose. In 1878, the county seat was returned to Benton, and the old temporary courthouse brick building then was converted into a grade school. Around the time in 1875, the Vincent Heisserer saloon building erected in 1867 was converted into a Masonic hall. Commerce was originally a Methodist town, with a congregation established as early as 1825 and without a Baptist church until 1906.

<text>Bethel is a village in Shelby County, Missouri, United States. The population was 135 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Bethel was founded as a Bible utopian colony in 1844 by Dr William Keil (1811–1877), a Prussian-born preacher. He and his followers, who were almost exclusively German immigrants to America, believed that the Book of Acts required that Christians hold all property and means of production in common and they organized their Colony accordingly. Traditionally male work was communally performed; however, traditionally female work was still individualized and performed in single family households.

By 1850, the Bethel Colony had a population of 500; by 1860, 600. It owned thousands of sheep, cattle and horses, and had over 3,500 acres under cultivation. It was the commercial center of the region. However, the construction of the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph Railroad threatened Dr. Keil&#x27;s theocracy. In 1855, he led his some of his followers westward over the Oregon Trail, to eventually settle Aurora, Oregon and form the Aurora Colony. Other wagon trains followed in subsequent years. The remainder of the Bethel Colony retained their communal ownership of property and shared means of production until three years after his death in 1877. In 1880, the property was divided among the remaining members, thus ending Missouri&#x27;s most successful communal experiment.

The Bethel Historic District, bounded by Liberty, King, 1st, and 4th Streets, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. At least twenty of the buildings constructed by the Bethel Colony are still extant. These houses are on exhibit to visitors and to the public.

<text>The City of Lake St. Louis is a planned community, and suburb of greater St. Louis, situated around two lakes between Interstate 70 and Interstate 64 in western St. Charles County, Missouri, United States. The population was 16,707 as of the 2020 US Census. Lake St. Louis is 43 miles from the city of St. Louis.

==History==

In January 1961, Ellis Ellerman and Ira Nathan begin developing plans for a private resort community, a popular concept in the 1960s in the St. Louis region. The vision was for a weekend resort with a lake large enough for recreation and a location close to St. Louis. Ellerman and Nathan hired engineers to begin the initial planning of the lake and community, and Nathan named the project &quot;Lake St. Louis&quot; in 1961.

Ellerman and Nathan formed Trails Lake Development Corp. in 1962, and by August 31 of that year, 10 lots had already been sold in the project, which was to feature a 625 lake (PD article 8-25-63). Ellerman and Nathan lacked adequate financing and business experience, and they soon found themselves in over their heads on the project. Ellerman and Nathan were soon joined by several other investors to keep the project afloat, including R. T. Crow. The financial troubles continued for Ellerman and Nathan, and The Healey Discount Corp., owned by Crow and the three other investors, foreclosed on Ellerman and Nathan&#x27;s Trails Lake Development Corp. in June 1966.

R. T. Crow felt the location of &quot;Lake St. Louis&quot; (indicating a change of ownership and the &quot;planned community&quot; concept), between two major highways, I-70 and Rt. 61, and the westward growth of St. Louis justified building a new town, rather than just the weekend community envisioned by Ellerman and Nathan. He investigated the idea of new towns, including visiting many others in the east. In the end, Crow bought out the other three investors who were part of The Healey Discount Corp., and he became the sole developer of the Lake St. Louis development. St. Charles County approved the preliminary plan for Lake St. Louis in April 1967. People who had purchased lots from the first developers were given credits for lots in the new Lake St. Louis project.

The first residents of Lake St. Louis were the Neal family, who moved to an existing home on the property in January, 1968. Gene Neal later became a vice president of one of Crow&#x27;s companies, his wife Hazel managed the Lake St. Louis Country Club. Son Mike played the &quot;boy&quot; of various mythical families in the development&#x27;s television and print advertising, and later was a founding member of the community&#x27;s water ski club.

By 1969, the Lake Ste. Louise, the 9-hole, 3-par golf course, tennis courts, clubhouse and pool were open. Construction on the dam for the Lake St. Louis, the larger of the two lakes in the community, began in 1968. It was completed in 1972, and Crow filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 1974 - an action brought on in part by the energy crisis. Interstate highway speeds were reduced from . Also, the I-70 bridge over the Missouri River was closed partially while the second bridge was added. The combination of events suddenly made Lake St. Louis too far away from employment and retail centers.

With Crow out of the picture, and the looming threat of annexation from O&#x27;Fallon on the East and Wentzville on the West, the residents of the Harbor Town area of the community petitioned St. Charles County Circuit Court for incorporation of the Town of Harbor Town. The Court granted the petition in June, 1975, and with the approval of the incorporation, the Circuit Court appointed a Board of Trustees: George Heidelbaugh, Charles Bailey, David Spitznagel, Betty Patton and Howard Haddock as Chairman. In December 1975, the town boundaries were expanded to include what was known as Phase A, the westernmost portion of the city. In 1976, a special census was conducted that counted 2,445 residents. Residents voted in 1977 to change the name to Lake St. Louis and become a 4th Class City under the Revised Statutes of Missouri. Howard Haddock was elected as the first mayor of the city.

==Community association==
The two lakes in the city of Lake St. Louis are private lakes owned by the membership of the Lake St. Louis Community Association (LSLCA). The LSLCA was formed to maintain and administer the Lake St. Louis amenities and provide services for the recreation-oriented community. The community association is funded by an assessment on all property within the LSLCA membership area. Originally all owners of property inside the city were automatically members of the LSLCA; however, as the city grew, the need to prevent lake overcrowding resulted in newer residential developments not having membership in the LSLCA. Since the lakes, as well as a country club, marinas, and several park areas, are private property of the community association, they are not available for use by non-members. This means that many residents of the city are not permitted to use the lakes, because their property is not covered by LSLCA membership.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Top employers===
According to the Lake St. Louis Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018, the top employers in the city were:

===Commercial development===
When Schnucks opened a store on the city&#x27;s previously undeveloped south side in 2004, at the intersection of I-64 and Lake St. Louis Boulevard, it marked the beginning of a rapid retail and commercial growth for the city. This was the first new retail development the city had seen in 17 years. In addition to the Schnucks development, the National Information Solutions Cooperative (NISC) also announced plans to build its $18 million 135,000-square-foot headquarters near the same intersection in 2004. The initial commercial development of 2004 was soon followed by the development of two large retail districts in the city: The Shoppes at Hawk Ridge and The Meadows at Lake St. Louis. Prior to this period of current retail growth, the city had very little commercial development. Residents of the lakeside community traveled to nearby Wentzville or O&#x27;Fallon for most shopping, dining, and other service needs that were not previously available in the city.

====The Shoppes at Hawk Ridge====
Bounded by I-64 to the north, South Fox Hound Drive to the east, and Hawk Ridge Trail to the South, the Shoppes at Hawk Ridge is an 800,000 sq ft (74,000 m2) retail development situated on the south side of Lake St. Louis. The development was spurred by the new $26 million Hwy N overpass completed in October 2005, which eventually became part of the Page Avenue extension. The development was the largest retail project in St. Charles County at the time of its construction, and it opened in January 2006. The Hawk Ridge development is anchored by several big box and numerous smaller retailers and restaurants. Building styles and landscaping play a vital role in the look of the development. Some businesses were forced to abandon their standard store designs and color schemes in order to comply with style elements of the development.

====The Meadows at Lake St. Louis====
The second major retail development that anchors the Lake St. Louis retail district is The Meadows at Lake St. Louis. Opened in August 2008, the Meadows is an open-air shopping district geared toward the community&#x27;s affluent residents. The Meadows was developed to meet the growing demand for specialty stores and restaurants in St. Charles County, and it was billed as the first lifestyle center in the county. It features two landscaped boulevards in a downtown street grid, surrounded by 500,000 sq ft (46,000 m2) of restaurants and a variety of specialty retail stores. The retail portion of the development is anchored by upscale specialty department store Von Maur. Kansas City-based Ferguson Properties also plans to build a 110- to 120-room Marriott or Hilton branded hotel geared toward business travelers as part of the lifestyle center. The Meadows is located on on the north side of I-64 near Lake St. Louis Boulevard.

<text>Weldon Spring is a city in St. Charles County, Missouri, United States. The population was 5,326 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Weldon Spring was platted in 1864. The community took its name from a spring of the same name near the original town site. A post office called Weldon Spring was established in 1875, and remained in operation until 1957.

In 1941, the United States Army purchased 17,000 acres of land in the surrounding area. The Weldon Spring Ordnance Works built the largest explosives factory in the United States on the site. It was built to produce TNT and DNT for Allied forces during World War II. It closed on August 15, 1945, days after the end of the war. Most of the land was then sold.

A proposal appeared in 1945 suggesting the placement of United Nations Headquarters in the area.

In 1955, the United States Atomic Energy Commission built a uranium ore processing plant on the 2,000 remaining acres. Weldon Spring Uranium Feed Mill Plant produced yellow cake uranium ore. In 1966, the plant closed and remained abandoned for 20 years. The site was contaminated with over 1.5 million cubic yards of asbestos, radioactive uranium and contaminated rubble. The U.S. Department of Energy began a decontamination of the site in the late 1980s and completed it in 2001, with a 45-acre rubble mountain over the site.

==&quot;In God We Trust&quot; insignia controversy==

Sally Hunt of Maryland Heights spoke to the Wentzville Board of Aldermen on February 28, 2018, regarding an &quot;In God We Trust&quot; insignia recently mounted on the dais. Hunt&#x27;s speech to the council was interrupted and she was forcibly removed from the room by police acting on the order of the mayor. Hunt and the mayor differ on whether Hunt had exceeded her allotted time to speak. The ACLU sued Wentzville in April 2018 on behalf of Hunt which was settled in November 2018. City of Wentzville insurance will pay $2,670 to the ACLU to offset lawyers&#x27; fees and legal cost. According to the terms of the settlement, Wentzville law enforcement officers will not remove a person from a council meeting without probable cause.

<text>Osceola is a city in and the county seat of St. Clair County, Missouri, United States. The population was 909 at the 2020 census. During the American Civil War, Osceola was the site of the Sacking of Osceola.

==History==
Located on the Osage River, the land that became the town of Osceola was inhabited by the tribe of Osage Native Americans, also known as NiuKonska, Native Americans who gave the river its name. NiuKonska means &quot;Little Ones of the Middle Waters&quot;. Two treaties, in 1808 and 1825, signed by the Osage and the U.S. government gave up all the tribe&#x27;s land in Missouri. With the way cleared for non-native settlers, more people began to arrive in the St. Clair County area in the mid-1830s. The town is named after the famous Seminole Chief Osceola. The name was first used at a Town Board meeting on March 30, 1859.

The town was the site of the September 1861 Sacking of Osceola by Jayhawkers (anti-slavery patrols) in which the town was burned and its courthouse looted. The town of 2,077 people was plundered and burned to the ground, 200 slaves were freed and nine local citizens were court-martialed and executed. The event inspired the 1976 Clint Eastwood film &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;.

In September 2011, on the 150th anniversary of the Sacking of Osceola, the Osceola Board of Aldermen passed a resolution asking the University of Kansas to no longer to use &quot;Jayhawk&quot; as its mascot and nickname. Further, the resolution asks Missouri residents to stop spelling Kansas or &quot;KU&quot; with a capital letter because &quot;neither is a proper name or a proper place&quot;.

The Osceola Public School Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

<text>Bismarck is a city in St. Francois County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,546 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
Bismarck, situated in the western part of St. Francois County, owes its origin and early growth to the farming interests about it and its location at the intersection of the Belmont branch with the main line of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway. Bismarck was first laid out and platted in 1868. It was named after the Iron Chancellor of Germany, Prince Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck, as there was a strong desire to attract German immigrants to the growing railroad area.

The railroad ran through the town from the northwest to the southeast. All of the original streets of Bismarck, with the exception of Main and Center, were named after trees.

In 1877, Bismarck was incorporated as a town by the County Court and the first trustees were William H. Gullivan, Benjamin Schoch, C. C. Grider, George H. Kelly and A. H. Tegmeyer. In the year 1881, this incorporation was abolished. Since that time, Bismarck has been reincorporated. According to folklorist Margot Ford McMillen the name of the town caused some difficult times for residents following America&#x27;s entry into World War I. With patriotism running high, a town named for a famous German leader was seen as &quot;un-American&quot;, and prompted some citizens to advocate changing the name to &quot;Loyal&quot;. However the majority of residents soundly rejected the idea.

The population about 1910 was 848. It is now 1,579.

<doc id="123152" wikidata="Q518513" url="?curid=123152" title="Bonne Terre, Missouri">
<text>Bonne Terre ( ) is a city in St. Francois County, Missouri, United States with a population of 6,864 at the 2010 census. Situated in the Southeast Missouri Lead District, lead mining shaped the history and character of the area from the earliest French settlers in the 1720s until today, even though Bonne Terre Mine established by St. Joseph lead mining company in 1864 closed in 1962. Mine tailing piles eroded, and contaminated the area as dust, posing residential hazards or were washed into the Big River. Only in 1992, the Bonne Terre Mine Tailings Site was listed as a Superfund site; as of 2022 remediation is still ongoing.

The Bonne Terre Depot from 1909, the St. Joe Lead Company Administration Building and the Bonne Terre Mine, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The latter is spring water filled and has become a scuba diving attraction.

Bonne Terre is also home to the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center, a 3000 bed prison of adult males who may have substance abuse issues or are mentally disabled, where Missouri has conducted all of its executions since April 2005.

==Geography==
Bonne Terre is part of the Southeast Missouri Lead District, an area of rolling hills of the Ozark Plateau with elevations up to 300 feet. The ground is mostly red clay over a base of limestone. The area contains the highest concentration of galena (lead(II) sulfide) in the world.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==History==
===Lead mining era, 1860s-1963===
The community was originally part of the Louisiana Territory and settled by Frenchmen in 1720 after they discovered lead ore. Two Frenchmen, La Motte and Philip Francois Renault, had left France in 1719 with 200 miners in search of minerals as part of the Company of the West. Surface miners referred to it as &quot;La Bonne Terre&quot; around 1825, meaning &quot;the good soil&quot; because of the lead. In 1828, St. Anne, the first Catholic chapel in St Francois County, was built here.

In 1864, Bonne Terre Mine was established by St. Joseph lead mining company which was incorporated in NYC the same year. In 1865, a new superintendent, J. C. Winslow, brought a number of Cornish miners. 
Underground mining began in 1869. After a post office was established in 1868, the corporate name of the town, &quot;St. Joe´s mines&quot; changed to Bonne Terre.

Major lead mining operations from the 1870s also included the Desloge Lead Company, and Doe Run. The Desloge mines were started by Firmin V. Desloge, and above-ground works were bounded approximately by present-day Division Street on the west, Benham Street on the south, Route 67 on the east, and the township line to the north.

In 1880, Bone Terre was platted as a town. The miners were local small farmers, timber cutters and rock quarrymen supplementing their income, and later Hungarian and other Slavic and southern European immigrants. 
In 1890, the Mississippi River &amp; Bonne Terre Railroad hauled ore to Herculaneum smelters. The Bonne Terre Depot from 1909 still exists. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, St. Joe Lead was the only one of initially dozens of mining companies left, as it had bought up the remaining companies. In 1962, the mine closed. Lead mine tailings were used as paving gravel for decades.

In 1977, heavy rains caused about 50,000 cubic yards of tailings to slough into the Big River.

===21st century===
Chat dumps or mine tailing piles remain until today; lead dust contaminated the surrounding area and was a hazard to residents. Only in 1992, the Bonne Terre Mine Tailings Site was listed as a Superfund Site. As of 2021, over 1,400 residential yards have been remediated. The Bonne Terre East Tailings Flat is still used as a repository for lead-contaminated soils. Because lead levels in fish downstream of the mining area are elevated above World Health Organization Standards, the state of Missouri advises people not to eat fish they catch from the Big River.

Bonne Terre is home to the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center, a roughly 3000-bed prison of adult males who may have substance abuse issues or are mentally disabled. Since April 2005, Missouri has conducted all of its executions there.

==Arts and culture==

In 1974, Bonne Terre Mine, and in 1984 St. Joe Lead Company Administration Building were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
The mine was the first in the network of St. Joe Minerals lead mines that led to Missouri producing 70 percent of the United States&#x27; lead in the Southeast Missouri Lead District. The mine was a target of Price&#x27;s Raid during the American Civil War. The mine is open for tours and is also known as a scuba diving attraction.

The French village was a campsite on a trail branching of the Camino Real. Downtown architecture includes as the oldest building the Shepard house from 1869, while the former post office is from 1878 and a bathhouse (natatorium) is from 1889. The city hall from 1909 was built in Tudor style, and reportedly is a replica of Shakespeare´s home, while the modern city hall was built as a cash and carry store.

Bonne Terre is also home to a Space Museum. It has a flag that went to the moon with astronaut Eugene Cernan on Apollo 17.
