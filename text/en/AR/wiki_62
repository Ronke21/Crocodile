<text>Green City is a city in northeast Sullivan County, Missouri, United States. The population was 657 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
The community is located on Missouri Route 129 one half mile north of Missouri Route 6 and ten miles northeast of Milan. Yellow Creek flows past two miles to the west and the Union Ridge Conservation Area on Spring Creek is two miles to the northeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==History==
Green City traces its beginnings to April, 1880 when Sullivan County farmer Henry Pfeiffer commissioned surveyor Thomas J. Dockery to lay out the town in what had previously been a cornfield. The town plat consisted of fifty lots, each 60-by-130 feet. The impetus for the town was the Quincy, Missouri &amp; Pacific railway, which laid tracks close by in the early 1880s. A rail depot was built with donations from area farmers, and in 1881 C. B. Comstock built a store and warehouse. Around the same time a small frame building was moved from the nearby village of Kiddville by S.H. Davis who used it as a post office when he became Green City&#x27;s first postmaster. Green City was officially incorporated on February 10, 1882.

Green City, Missouri, is the site of Widmark Airport (FAA LID: MO83). Towns the size of Green City, whose population numbered only 688 inhabitants in 2000, usually do not have airports, but Richard Widmark owned a cattle ranch in the area during the 1950s and 1960s. Widmark contributed funds to the construction of an airport which led to its being named in his honor.

Green City Presbyterian Church and Green City Railroad Depot are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Notable events===
* May 25, 1885 — Green City College is established. A large three-story brick building was constructed at a cost of $4,500. The first classes were held October 13, 1883 with thirteen students enrolled. By the end of the first term the number had increased to thirty-three, and the second years enrollment totaled eighty. A one-year college preparatory program comprising four terms was offered as well as a full four-year collegiate program.
* June 24, 1918 - A large tornado passed just to the north of Green City. The town proper was spared much damage, however seven people were killed and at least a dozen more injured in the rural areas near the town. Considerable property damage to rural homes and farms also resulted.
* November 5, 1931 — A large fire destroyed much of the east side of the Green City town square. A total of four buildings, housing at least six businesses and the City Hall, were a complete loss. The only building left standing was that which housed the Bank of Green City and the Green City Hotel.
* March 26, 1931 — Noted bank robber and &quot;gangster&quot; Fred &quot;Killer&quot; Burke was apprehended near Green City. He had been living there for some time under an assumed name.

<doc id="123270" wikidata="Q613646" url="?curid=123270" title="Humphreys, Missouri">
<text>Humphreys is a village in southwest Sullivan County, Missouri, United States. The population was 89 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Humphreys is located in southwestern Sullivan County. The community is at the intersection of Missouri State Routes 6 and 139. The community of Galt is about four miles to the west in Grundy County. Medicine Creek flows past about three miles to the west and Muddy Creek flows past the east side of the community.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Humphreys, originally known as Haley City, was first surveyed in April 1881 by G.M. Garvey for the Stringer family. When originally established, it consisted of just seventeen blocks with 246 lots. Additions of three blocks and nine blocks were made in January and May 1882, respectively. It was sometime during that spring of 1882 that the town name was changed to Humphreys. The town experienced rapid early growth, being located on the Quincy, Missouri &amp; Pacific Railroad, with the train depot being constructed in August 1881. James Stringer established the first store in June 1881, and by the end of the year the new town supported four hotels, two drug stores, two dry goods stores, a general merchandise, and a millinery. A harness shop joined the business list in 1884 and blacksmiths in 1886 and 1887.

Light industry of a sort came to Humphreys in 1882 with the establishment of the Humphreys Milling Company, a steam-powered flour mill located in a large three-story building. It was said to have produced up to twenty-five barrels of flour per day at peak capacity. The citizenry&#x27;s need for news was met by the &quot;Humphreys Gazette&quot;, a weekly newspaper founded in late 1881 by Joseph S. Wright. The name was changed to the &quot;Humphreys Advance&quot; in 1884 but the venture ultimately proved unprofitable and publication ceased in August 1887.

=== Education ===

The children of Humphreys were educated in a typical one-room rural schoolhouse, located about three-fourths of a mile northwest of the community until 1885. At that time, the elementary and secondary education were combined with and housed in the building containing the Humphreys College and Business Institute. The College was established in 1884 on four acres of land donated by James M. Stringer. A large two-story brick structure was constructed between June and September 1884, with the first class admission beginning on September 29 of the aforementioned year. Humphreys College was co-education and offered two course tracks of study—preparatory and collegiate, with a reported enrollment in 1887 of 157 students. No dormitories were constructed; however, ample housing was available in the town&#x27;s hotels and private homes. Humphreys College and Business Institute was completely destroyed by fire on April 8, 1893.

==Humphreys today==
Humphreys is largely a &quot;bedroom community&quot; today with little if any businesses. Most citizens must travel to larger cities in the region such as Milan, Trenton, Brookfield and Kirksville for employment. After a population low of 98 in 1990, the town rebounded in 2000 with 164 citizens. Presently, children from Humphreys attend Grundy County R-5 school in Galt. The two small towns merged their schools in 1966 to create the new district. On July 26, 2011, the United States Postal Service announced plans to permanently close the Humphreys post office as part of a nationwide restructuring plan. No official date for closing has yet been announced. Humphreys&#x27; first post office was established in 1881 and has been in continuous operation since.

<text>Pollock is a village in north central Sullivan County, Missouri, United States. The population was 46 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Pollock was established in July 1873 by H.F. Warner and William Lane and originally consisted of thirty-two blocks. Another fourteen blocks, located south of the original, was added to the town plat in 1876 via Godfrey&#x27;s Addition.
By 1877 Pollock included two general stores, a drug store, blacksmith shop, one hotel, a schoolhouse and a small depot for the Burlington &amp; Southwestern Railroad with a town population of one hundred, and a United States Post Office was established in Pollock in 1879. A major fire swept through a portion of the Pollock business district in January 1936. Three buildings—Rosenberry&#x27;s Garage, Morlan General Store, and Anspach Cafe&#x27; -- were total losses, while buildings containing O.L. Casto&#x27;s store and Miller&#x27;s Store received major damage.&lt;br&gt;
The Pollock community had a high school between 1923 and 1939. Class sizes were predictable small considering the towns population, with an average of ten students per class year. The smallest class was 1938 with only three graduates, while the largest was the Class of 1937 with thirteen diploma recipients. Due to economic conditions the junior and senior years were discontinued between 1932 and 1937, and students in those grades had to finish their education elsewhere, primarily Milan, which was readily accessible via rail. The Pollock high school closed for good following the 1939 graduation and all secondary students incorporated into the Milan school district. The elementary school continued a few years longer into the mid 1950s. Currently all children in the Pollock area attend classes in the Milan C-2 school district.&lt;br&gt; 

In the mid-1970s, not long after Pollock celebrated its centennial, eight new apartments—housed in two buildings—were constructed for use by the elderly. A new all-metal community building was constructed in the late 1980s, with an addition to the building to house the U.S. Post Office built in the late 1990s. Significant community support resulted in the building of a Pollock City Park around 1990. Residents William Casteel, Melvin Casto and Dick Stewart spearheaded a fundraising campaign and recruited volunteers from far and wide to acquire park equipment and prepare the grounds. 
Pollock suffered a significant blow on July 26, 2011, when the United States Postal Service announced plans to permanently close the Pollock post office as part of a nationwide restructuring plan. An earlier attempt in the late 1980s to close the Pollock post office was appealed and overturned with the help of U.S. Senator Kit Bond and other Missouri politicians.

==Geography==
Pollock is located about two miles south of the Sullivan-Putnam county line. The community is on Missouri Route M approximately one mile east of Missouri Route 5. A section of the Burlington and Quincy Railroad passes the west side of the town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==Etymology==
The city was named after Kabul, Afghanistan, using an older English spelling of the name, in 1882. The British Army had just withdrawn from Kabul at the end of the Second Anglo-Afghan War the year before. As local legend goes, one of the construction engineers who built the railroad through Cabool also worked on railroad construction in Afghanistan and thought this area of southern Texas County looked similar to the region of Kabul, Afghanistan. Prior to being called Cabool, the community was known as Cedar Bluff. It remains the only &quot;Cabool&quot; in the United States of America.

Old legends claim that Cabool was named after the Indian chief who lived there, whose name was &quot;Chief Kabul&quot; (pronounced Kay-Bull). The story continues with the narrative that Chief Kabul and his sweetheart jumped ( into the &quot;onyx pool&quot; ) together to their deaths off Cedar Bluff at Cabool, as their parents disapproved of their relationship. This legend was depicted in the 1903 poem &quot;Legend of Cabool&quot;, written by Tug Wilson and Ben Durnell.

<text>Houston is a city in Texas County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,079 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Texas County.

==History==
Houston was founded in 1857 and was named after Sam Houston.

During the Civil War, Houston was sometimes defended by units of the 5th Missouri State Militia.

The Arthur W. and Chloe B. Cole House, Houston High School, and Houston Ranger Station Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Emmett Kelly==

Houston&#x27;s most famous resident was Emmett Kelly, who became an internationally known clown. Kelly was born December 9, 1898, and as a young child he and his family moved to a farm in Houston from his birthplace of Sedan, Kansas. Kelly attended his first circus performances in the summer of 1909 when both the Mighty Haag and M.L. Clark and Son&#x27;s circuses appeared in the area.

In 1917, Kelly moved to Kansas City, as an aspiring newspaper cartoonist. It was there that he created the cartoon character of a tramp who later became known around the world as &quot;Weary Willie&quot;. While living in Kansas City, Kelly began working for carnivals and circuses and trained as a trapeze artist.

In August 1920, Kelly returned to his adopted hometown of Houston, Missouri where he appeared as a &quot;cartoonist and comedy specialist&quot; at the town&#x27;s annual &quot;Old Settlers Reunion&quot;.

After a successful career as a trapeze artist with the John Robinson Circus, Kelly was hired in 1932 by the Hagenbeck-Wallace circus as a clown. It was there that he first began performing as &quot;Weary Willie,&quot; a sad-faced character who would become known around the world. After performing with the Cole Bros. Circus and Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Kelly took the character to Hollywood where he appeared in numerous films and on network television programs and advertisements.

===Honors===

On August 9, 1956 the Kelly family visited Houston when the town renamed the open area where the &quot;Old Settlers Reunion&quot; had taken place &quot;Emmett Kelly Park&quot; in his honor. Nineteen years later Kelly returned to Houston for a final time when Governor Kit Bond recognized Houston&#x27;s former resident by declaring October 9, 1975 as &quot;Emmett Kelly Day&quot; in Missouri. Since then, the annual &quot;Emmett Kelly Clown Festival&quot; has attracted clowns from across the region, including Kelly&#x27;s grandson, Joey Kelly, who returned to perform as a special guest in 2007. Although the festival ended its original 21-year run in May 2008, it returned in April 2022 when Kelly&#x27;s daughter, Stasia, was presented with a key to the city.

Kelly was inducted into the Circus Ring of Fame in Sarasota, Florida in 1988 and International Circus Hall of Fame in Peru, Indiana in 1994. On May 1, 1996, a bust of Kelly was dedicated in the &quot;Hall of Famous Missourians&quot; at the state capitol in Jefferson City, Missouri.

<text>Nevada ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Vernon County, Missouri, United States. The population was 8,386 at the 2010 census, and 8,254 in the 2018 estimate. The local government has a council-manager model.

==History==

When French explorers entered the region in the late 17th century, they encountered the indigenous Osage people, who controlled a vast area extending west from present-day Saint Louis, including territories now within several states. The Osage Village State Historic Site, formerly known as the Carrington Osage Village Site, is located on a hilltop above the Osage River valley. Archeological evidence shows an Osage band had nearly 200 lodges and an estimated population of 2000 to 3000 here; they occupied the area from about 1700–1775. They were the most influential people in the region and were integral to the fur trade. 

After the United States acquired the territory west of the Mississippi River in the Louisiana Purchase, through the rest of the 19th century, it gradually forced the Osage to cede their lands and remove to Indian Territory. This site has been designated as a National Historic Landmark for its significance to the Osage people and American history.

Nevada was originally called &quot;Hog Eye&quot; by European-American settlers, and under that name was platted in 1855. The town&#x27;s name was changed to Nevada by circuit and county clerk DeWitt C. Hunter, after Nevada City, California, where he had been a gold miner.

From 1897 to 1933, Nevada was home to the Weltmer Institute of Suggestive Therapeutics, founded by Sidney Abram Weltmer and Joseph H. Kelly. Weltmer bought a 17-room mansion, built in 1886 by Frank P. Anderson, a successful railroad builder. They wanted a facility large enough so that they could have patients stay for extended periods in a kind of boarding house. During the early 20th century, this healing institute attracted thousands of clients who believed in Weltmer&#x27;s cures by mental healing. People paid $100 to stay for a 10-day course of treatment. They also paid for instructional classes. The institute also conducted a large mail-order business for classes and a kind of treatment by mail. It held lectures attracting several hundred people at a time.

The Institute attracted so many clients that the railroad added new trains to its schedule serving the town. In addition, the volume of mail associated with the institute&#x27;s business resulted in the post office being classified as first class, and the government building a new, larger post office to handle it. The Weltmer Institute became the center of associated wellness systems and practitioners in town, which increased in prosperity. It attracted clairvoyants and psychotherapists, emerging as a new profession. It also attracted people promising various types of miracle cures for such illnesses as tuberculosis, which then had no cure.

In the early 20th century, the town attracted many enthusiasts of what was known as the New Thought Movement. In 1905 the Weltmer Auditorium was the site of the Fifth Annual Convention of the New Thought Federation, held on September 26–29, 1905. Ernest Weltmer, the eldest son of Sidney A. Weltmer, was Secretary of the Federation and helped open the convention. Among the several speakers from across the country was Grace Mann Brown, and entertainment was provided by singers including the Weltmer Quartette. Mrs. Brown served as President of the Federation the following year. In 1916, New Thought followers returned to Nevada for the second International Conference of the movement, and Sidney A. Weltmer was among the speakers.

After Weltmer&#x27;s death and the institute&#x27;s closure in 1933, the mansion was sold for use as a funeral home. By late 2004, the building was slated for demolition to redevelop the site. Although some residents were interested in its history and the Weltmer Institute, the building was never nominated as a significant historic building or classified for preservation. The City Council approved it being scheduled to be demolished in late 2004 for other development.

Significant historic properties in Nevada include the Infirmary Building, Missouri State Hospital Number 3, Vernon County Courthouse, and Vernon County Jail, Sheriff&#x27;s House and Office, which are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Potosi is a city in Washington County, Missouri, United States. Potosi is seventy-two miles southwest of St. Louis. The population was 2,538 as of the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Washington County.

Located in the Lead Belt, the city was founded in 1763 by French colonists as &quot;Mine à Breton&quot; or &quot;Mine au Breton&quot;. After the United States acquired this area, American Moses Austin renamed the community for the Bolivian silver-mining city of Potosí. He was involved in lead mining.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Potosi is located in the Lead Belt region of Missouri; as such, it has mining operations in the area. It is also geographically considered part of the St. Francois Mountain Range, meaning it has hilly terrain typical of the region.

The city is within proximity to many nature areas, including Mark Twain National Forest and Washington State Park.

===Climate===
== History ==

A lead mining settlement at this spot, &quot;Mine à Breton&quot; or &quot;Mine au Breton&quot;, was founded between 1760 and 1780 by Francis Azor, of Brittany, France. Moses Austin came here in 1798 with his family, including his son Stephen F. Austin. Moses obtained a grant of 7,153 arpents of land from the Spanish Empire and started large-scale mining operations, building his town to support it. Moses named the town after Potosí in Bolivia, which was famous for its vast silver mines. Austin&#x27;s tomb and the foundation of his home Durham Hall can still be seen. Another mining entrepreneur in Potosi at the time of Moses Austin was James Bryan. Firmin Rene Desloge, who emigrated from Nantes, France in 1822 as the progenitor of the Desloge Family in America, settled in Potosi and established a mercantile, distillery, fur trading and lead smelting business. The Desloge lead mining business, Desloge Lead Company (later Desloge Consolidated Lead Company) was eventually relocated to Bonne Terre, and eventually Desloge, by Firmin V. Desloge.

Potosi was designated county seat in 1814.

Potosi is also home to the oldest standing Presbyterian church west of the Mississippi River. It is located on West Breton Street, also home to the graveyard that contains the tomb of Moses Austin and his wife Maria Brown Austin.

The Potosi Correctional Center, which opened in 1989, housed Missouri&#x27;s death row until 2005. The Potosi Center conducted all but one of the sixty-two Missouri executions between 1989 and 2005, when executions were moved to the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre.

The George Cresswell Furnace, Palmer Historic Mining District, Washington County Courthouse, and Washington State Park CCC Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Greenville is a city located on U.S. Route 67 near the intersection with Route D and E in Wayne County, Missouri, United States, along the St. Francis River. The population was 443 at the 2020 census. Greenville was incorporated and founded as the county seat of Wayne County in 1819.

== History ==
Greenville was named after Fort Greene Ville (now Greenville), Ohio, the site where General Anthony Wayne signed a treaty with the Native Americans after defeating them in the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794. This was the final battle of the Northwest Indian War. Wayne County was named for this military hero and Greenville was named for the place he was most famous for. Incidentally, Fort Greene Ville, Ohio, was named after Nathanael Greene, a friend of Wayne.

In 1826, Greenville flooded. On August 10, 1832, the first post office opened. Confederate Brigadier General William J. Hardee and officers Patrick Cleburne, Thomas C. Hindman, and Basil W. Duke along with about 800 men were stationed close to Greenville near the outset of the Civil War until they began to retreat to Randolph County, Arkansas on August 28, 1861. On July 20, 1862, a camp of two companies of the 12th Missouri State Militia was attacked at daylight, surprising the camp, taking most of their rifles, 16 Savage revolvers, all of their horses, 50 pairs of holster pistols, and killing four of their men.

Greenville was incorporated as a village on February 23, 1893. In 1941, the village was relocated two miles to the north after the construction of Lake Wappapello.

Old Greenville (23WE637) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

==Geography==
Greenville is located on the southern edge of the Ozark Mountains, situated in a hilly, forested landscape. U.S. Route 67 passes through Greenville. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Greenville is on the east shore of Lake Wappapello, on the St. Francis River.

==Education==

There are two elementary schools—Greenville Elementary School and Williamsville Elementary School located in the nearby town of Williamsville for pre-kindergarten through sixth-grade students. Greenville Jr. High School (grades 7–8) and Greenville High School (grades 9-12) compose the remainder of the district. There are 762 students and 57 teachers in grades K-12 in the district. The school colors are red and black and its mascot is the bear. School athletics consist of boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; basketball, girls&#x27; volleyball, boys&#x27; baseball, girls&#x27; softball, and cheerleading.

For adults aged 25 and older in Greenville, 26.7% possess a high school diploma or GED as their highest educational attainment and 5.5% possess a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher educational degree while 2.4% of the population possesses a post-graduate or professional degree.

<text>Jaufre Rudel (Jaufré in modern Occitan) was the prince of Blaye (&quot;Princes de Blaia&quot;) and a troubadour of the early- to mid-12th century, who probably died during the Second Crusade, in or after 1147. He is noted for developing the theme of &quot;love from afar&quot; (&quot;amor de lonh&quot; or &quot;amour de loin&quot;) in his songs.

Very little is known about his life, but a reference to him in a contemporary song by Marcabru describes him as being &quot;oltra mar&quot;—across the sea, probably on the Second Crusade in 1147. Probably he was the son of Girard, also castellan of Blaye, and who was titled &quot;prince&quot; in an 1106 charter. Girard&#x27;s father was the first to carry the title, being called &quot;princeps Blaviensis&quot; as early as 1090. During his father&#x27;s lifetime the suzerainty of Blaye was disputed between the counts of Poitou and the counts of Angoulême. Shortly after the succession of William VIII of Poitou, who had inherited it from his father, Blaye was taken by Wulgrin II of Angoulême, who probably vested Jaufre with it. According to one hypothesis, based on flimsy evidence, Wulgrin was Jaufre&#x27;s father.

According to his legendary &quot;vida&quot;, or fictionalised biography, he was inspired to go on crusade upon hearing from returning pilgrims of the beauty of Countess Hodierna of Tripoli, and that she was his &quot;amor de lonh&quot;, his far-off love. The legend claims that he fell sick on the journey and was brought ashore in Tripoli a dying man. Countess Hodierna is said to have come down from her castle on hearing the news, and Rudel died in her arms. This romantic but unlikely story seems to have been derived from the enigmatic nature of Rudel&#x27;s verse and his presumed death on the Second Crusade.

Seven of Rudel&#x27;s poems have survived to the present day, four of them with music. His composition &quot;Lanquan li jorn&quot; is thought to be the model for the Minnesinger Walther von der Vogelweide&#x27;s crusade song &quot;Allerest lebe ich mir werde&quot; (&quot;Palästinalied&quot;).

==Rudel in legend and literature==

Nineteenth-century Romanticism found his legend irresistible. It was the subject of poems by Ludwig Uhland, Heinrich Heine, Robert Browning (&quot;Rudel to the Lady of Tripoli&quot;) and Giosué Carducci (&quot;Jaufré Rudel&quot;). Algernon Charles Swinburne returned several times to the story in his poetry, in &quot;The Triumph of Time&quot;, &quot;The Death of Rudel&quot; and the now-lost &quot;Rudel in Paradise&quot; (also titled &quot;The Golden House&quot;). In &quot;The Triumph of Time&quot;, he summarises the legend:

&lt;poem&gt;There lived a singer in France of old
By the tideless dolorous midland sea.
In a land of sand and ruin and gold
There shone one woman, and none but she.
And finding life for her love&#x27;s sake fail,
Being fain to see her, he bade set sail,
Touched land, and saw her as life grew cold,
And praised God, seeing; and so died he.&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;Died, praising God for his gift and grace:
For she bowed down to him weeping, and said
&quot;Live&quot;; and her tears were shed on his face
Or ever the life in his face was shed.
The sharp tears fell through her hair, and stung
Once, and her close lips touched him and clung
Once, and grew one with his lips for a space;
And so drew back, and the man was dead.&lt;/poem&gt;

Sir Nizamat Jung Bahadur, of Hyderabad, also wrote an epic poem on the subject, &quot;Rudel of Blaye&quot;, in 1926.

The French dramatist Edmond Rostand took the legend of Rudel and Hodierna as the basis for his 1895 verse drama &quot;La Princesse Lointaine&quot;, but reassigned the female lead from Hodierna to her jilted daughter Melisende, played by Sarah Bernhardt. However, there are older mentions of Rudel loving Melisende, such as Frederic Mistral&#x27;s 1878 Provençal dictionary &quot;Lou Tresor dóu Felibrige&quot; which states (translation): &quot;Mélisende, Mélissande or Mélissène, countess of Tripoli, daughter of Aimeri de Lusignan, loved by the troubadour Geoffroi Rudel&quot;.

More recently, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho has written an opera about Rudel and Clémence (the name used for Hodierna) called &quot;L&#x27;amour de loin&quot;, with a libretto by Amin Maalouf, which was given its world premiere at the Salzburg Festival in 2000 and its US premiere at the Santa Fe Opera in 2002.

<text>Dillon is a city in and the county seat of Beaverhead County, Montana, United States. The population was 3,880 at the 2020 census. The city was named for Sidney Dillon (1812–1892), president of Union Pacific Railroad.

==History==

Dillon was founded in the Beaverhead Valley as a railroad town in 1880. Originally named “Terminus” as it was temporarily the northernmost stop on the Utah and Northern Railway while it was under construction, in 1881, the community was renamed for Union Pacific Railroad President Sidney Dillon, who had directed the project of bringing the railroad through to Butte, Montana. The town&#x27;s location was selected by the railroad in part because of its proximity to gold mines in the area.

The first ore discovered in the Dillon area was silver. Gold was first discovered at Grasshopper Creek in 1862, precipitating a flood of immigration to the area. The last real gold rush in the area occurred near Argenta in 1920 and lasted for 30 years.

Dillon served as a central location for transporting goods to nearby boomtowns such as Bannack, Argenta, Glen, and Virginia City. In 1881, Dillon became part of a contentious battle with Bannack to become the county seat of Beaverhead County. The first brick building in Dillon was built in 1882. In 1884, Dillon became an incorporated town and began building sidewalks and permanent dwellings for the residents.

While many of the gold mining towns around Dillon died, Dillon was able to thrive due to the railroad and talc mining in the area. A cattle industry was established in 1865. The agriculturally rich Beaverhead Valley became an ideal location for sheep ranching, introduced in 1869. Dillon was once the largest exporter of sheep wool in Montana.

The Montana Normal College was established as a teaching college in 1892, and is still functioning today, renowned for its Education program. A circus elephant named Old Pitt was struck by lightning in 1943 and is buried at the Dillon fairgrounds. Captain Joel Rude of the Montana National Guard crashed his F-106 into a grain elevator and died during a Labor Day Parade on September 3, 1979. A plaque in his honor is part of the Southwest Montana Veterans Memorial park in Dillon.

<text>Wisdom is a census-designated place (CDP) in Beaverhead County, Montana, United States. The population was 98 at the 2010 census. The ZIP Code of the area is 59761. The town includes three tourist lodgings, service station, grocery, school (K-8), post office and a Forest Service office.

==History==
Wisdom was named for the Wisdom River, which is now named the Big Hole River, that passes through the town. The post office opened in 1884.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.82%, is water. Wisdom&#x27;s average elevation is , about 1.2 miles above sea level.

Wisdom is located along Montana Highway 43. Tweedy Mountain is nearby as is West Goat Peak.

===Climate===
Wisdom, owing to its high altitude and northerly location, has a subalpine climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) with long, cold, dry winters and short summers with very warm afternoons and cold, clear mornings. With over 277 mornings each year below freezing and only July ever completely frost-free, Wisdom is in terms of frequency of frost one of the coldest places in the United States. During major cold waves, Wisdom’s location in an enclosed valley can make for exceptionally low temperatures: was reached during a great cold wave on December 23, 1983, and has been reached during seven years, though not since February 4, 1989. Typically there are 47 mornings falling to or below , and as many as seven fall as low as , whilst 69.8 afternoons do not top freezing, a tally twice as large as central Montana areas affected by warm chinook winds.

Minimum temperatures during spring do not typically stay above freezing until well into June, although the average last spring ice day date is April 1 and the first fall ice day November 1. Low winter precipitation limits both snowfall and snow depth: the annual mean fall is , and the mean peak snow cover , with the most snow on the ground being on January 2, 1943. Snow cover is usually gone by the end of March, and despite occasional light snowfalls in May, snow on the ground in that month has not been recorded since 1953. Precipitation is heaviest during the spring, but the enclosed valley location means most moisture is always captured before reaching Wisdom: the wettest month since records began in 1923 has been May 1981 with , whilst the wettest calendar year has been 1967 with and the driest 1974 when only fell.

Although summer nights are chilly and even frosty, days can be very warm or even hot, although only 1.3 afternoons typically rise above and has never been recorded: Wisdom’s hottest temperature is on July 13, 2002, and the hottest minimum on July 23, 1936. On average only two mornings remain above each summer, and Wisdom has never recorded so high a minimum between October 20 and May 4 inclusive. By the end of August mornings fall to freezing in five-eighths of all years, and in seven-eighths by the end of September, with the weather continuing to cool into winter with the first minimum under zero expected on November 10.

<doc id="123326" wikidata="Q964578" url="?curid=123326" title="Crow Agency, Montana">
<text>Crow Agency () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Big Horn County, Montana, United States and is near the actual location for the Little Bighorn National Monument and re-enactment produced by the Real Bird family known as Battle of the Little Bighorn Reenactment. The population was 1,616 at the 2010 census. It is the governmental headquarters of the Crow Nation Native Americans. It is also the location of the &quot;agency offices&quot; where the federal Superintendent of the Crow Indian Reservation and his staff (part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, United States Department of the Interior) interacts with the Crow Tribe, pursuant to federal treaties and statutes.

The ending scenes in the film &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970) were filmed in Crow Agency.

==Geography==
Interstate 90 passes through the community, with access from Exit 509. U.S. Route 212 also passes through the town. Custer Creek runs alongside town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==History of the three locations of the &quot;Crow Agency&quot;==

The term &quot;Crow Agency&quot; has been historically used since 1868 for the headquarters where the United States directed the federal interaction with the Crow tribe on its reservation. The Crow Tribe&#x27;s reservations, and the tribe&#x27;s relations to the United States were defined by treaties between the Crow Tribe and the United States, and by United States statutes.

===A Reservation Without An Agency (1851-1868)===

The Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851 created extensive reservation lands for the Indian tribes in Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas at a time when the non-Indian presence in this area was limited to roving traders. A large reservation for the Crow Tribe was set out that was centered on the Big Horn Mountains and extended eastward into the Powder River basin to the banks of the Powder River. However, this treaty did not indicate agency sites for any of the tribes, including the Crows. At the time of the treaty, 1851 the Crow tribe consisted of nomadic bands whose culture was based on hunting the migratory buffalo herds, including those herds in the Powder River Country. Hunting in the Powder River area on the east side of the Big Horn Mountains brought the Crow in increasing conflict with more powerful bands of Sioux who were migrating westward. In 1863 gold was discovered in commercial quantities in the mountains of the western Montana Territory. Travelers to the gold fields left the Oregon Trail and traveled through the Powder River country, going up the east side of the Big Horns to the Yellowstone valley, and then westward. This route became known as the Bozeman Trail, and three forts were built to protect travelers. The Sioux conducted an all out war against the forts and the travelers on the Bozeman Trail called &quot;Red Cloud&#x27;s War&quot;, which finally forced the United States to agree to abandon the forts, and close the trail, and to remake the boundaries of the reservations for the Crow and Sioux in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868.

===The First Crow Agency (1868-1874)===

The Fort Laramie &quot;Treaty with the Crows, 1868&quot;, was one of a series of treaties that recognized the encroaching presence of the Sioux tribes into the Powder River Basin, and gave them that entire area as a hunting preserve. The separate 1868 treaty with the Crow moved the center of the Crow lands to the west of the Powder River Basin, into the western portions of the Yellowstone Valley. The 1868 Treaty provided for annuities and other federal support, and stipulated that the Crow would have an agency &quot;on the south side of the Yellowstone, near Otter Creek&quot;, close to present day Big Timber, Montana. The first Crow Agency (1869-1874) was eventually constructed about eight miles east of present-day Livingston, Montana on Mission Creek, and became known as Fort Parker. This first Crow Agency was located in the western reaches of the Yellowstone River Valley, north of the Absaroka Range of Mountains. The Crows continued a largely nomadic life style hunting on the buffalo ranges to the east, though this brought them in constant but sporadic conflict with the Sioux who dominated the Powder River area.

===The Second Crow Agency (1875-1884)===

In 1874 miners encroached on the western margins of Crow lands in the Absaroka Range, and the reservation was reduced in 1875. The first Crow Agency was within these ceded lands and so the Agency was relocated eastward to a new site just south of modern-day Absarokee, Montana. The second Crow Agency (1875-1884) was still located north of the Absaroka Range of Mountains but about 66 miles further east of Fort Parker in the Yellowstone Valley, on the Stillwater River which was a tributary of the Yellowstone River.

The nine year period from 1875 to 1884 was a time of rapid transition on the plains of eastern Montana and Wyoming. In 1876 the Crows provided scouts for the United States military forces in the Great Sioux War of 1876. The defeat by the Sioux of George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 resulted in a concerted military backlash against the Sioux, and by 1877 and 1878 the hostile bands of Sioux had either fled to Canada, or they had surrendered and were confined to reservations along the Missouri River in the Dakotas. This initially left the Crows more secure in their use of the buffalo ranges on the eastern Montana and Wyoming plains, but in 1876 and 1877 federal forts were built across this area. With hostile Indian presence essentially neutralized, hide hunters came to harvest the northern buffalo herds. By 1882 the buffalo were gone from this area. Also, in 1880 the Northern Pacific Railroad began building eastward from Bismarck, ND, and in 1882 they completed their northern transcontinental line, which passed up the Yellowstone River valley just as the last of the buffalo disappeared. Almost at once large Texas trail herds arrived in the Montana Territory to exploit the now empty open range on the vast plains of central and eastern Montana. These successive rapid changes in this 9-year period eliminated the herds of bison and reduced other wild game on which the Crow culture relied, and ended forever the Crow&#x27;s nomadic way of life.

===The Third Crow Agency (1884 to Present)===

In 1884 these events led to the last movement of the Crow Agency to the site of its third and final location at present day Crow Agency, Montana, 60 miles SE of Billings on the Little Bighorn River. This move of over a hundred miles eastward removed the Crow people from the vicinity of the Absaroka Range of Mountains, and from the Yellowstone River valley, and placed their reservation center on the east side of the Big Horn Mountains, on the western edge of the Powder River Basin of the northern great plains.

It was designed for 464 inmates, and was to be located on a sugar beet field. The facility was slated to open in July 2007 but the state of Montana would not approve it. The Authority bonds defaulted on May 1, 2008. The consortium&#x27;s contract terminated in January 2009 without any prisoners ever being housed in the jail.

<text>Lodge Grass () is a town in Big Horn County, Montana, United States. The population was 441 at the 2020 census.

It is at the confluence of Lodge Grass Creek and the Little Bighorn River, on the Crow Indian Reservation.

==Source and derivation of name==
The two words of the name of &quot;Lodge Grass&quot; are not usually put together, in that order, to make a commonly used name, or meaningful phrase. This is because the name &quot;Lodge Grass&quot; came from a mistake of interpretation of the Crow Indian name for &quot;Greasy Grass&quot;.

Lodge Grass is named after Lodge Grass Creek, which flows through the town, but as explained in a video viewed in 2013 on YouTube by Joe Medicine Crow, Crow tribal historian, the correct Crow name for Lodge Grass Creek is Greasy Grass Creek.

Crow tradition holds that when the Crows camped on the bottoms of the Lodge Grass Creek or the Little Bighorn River in the spring and summer, when the grass in the valley would be high and when the dew was heavy the bellies and legs of the horses would become wet and glisten as if covered with grease. In another traditional version of the same derivation of the name, when the Crows camped on the creek and walked through the thick grass in the morning when it held dew, their moccasins and leggings would get wet and they would look greasy. Thus the Crows called the valley areas of the Little Bighorn River and Lodge Grass Creek &quot;the Greasy Grass&quot;.

The Sioux also called the Little Horn River the Greasy Grass Creek.

The Crow name for &quot;greasy&quot; and the Crow name for &quot;lodge&quot; sound very much alike. The Crow word for &quot;greasy&quot; is &quot;Tah-shay&quot;, and the Crow word for &quot;lodge&quot; is &quot;Ah-shay&quot;, and the words sound so much alike that an early interpreter mistakenly interpreted the Crow name for &quot;Greasy Grass&quot; as &quot;Lodge Grass&quot;.

The misinterpreted name stuck, and so the creek, and then the town became known as Lodge Grass.

==Geography==

<text>Bearcreek is an incorporated town in Carbon County, Montana, United States. It is part of the Billings, Montana Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 91 at the 2020 census. Bearcreek uses the Mayor/Council form of government.

==History==
Bearcreek owes its existence to area coal mining that began in the 1890s to supply coal for the Northern Pacific Railway and the Anaconda Company. The Bearcreek Post Office was established on November 22, 1905, with Sarah Criger as the town&#x27;s first postmaster. The town was platted and incorporated after the arrival of the Montana, Wyoming &amp; Southern Railroad in 1906.

The town of Bearcreek was named for Bear Creek, which runs through the middle of town. Bearcreek came into existence due to coal mines and grew rapidly following the building of a short line railroad connecting the Bearcreek mines to the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1906. Between 1906 and 1953, the mines at Bearcreek produced large volumes of coal, which was a higher grade than other regional sources, from the extensive underground coal mining deposits. The mines were located along the creek and also in the surrounding coulees. The development of the coal mines after 1906 drew miners to the area. They came from other parts of America, and from Serbia, Montenegro, Germany, Scotland and Italy. The recent immigrants built separate ethnic-based communities in the steep coulees that run down into Bearcreek, with names like Washoe, New Caledonia, Chickentown, Scotch Coulee, International, and Stringtown. At one time in the 1920s and 1930s the population of Bearcreek combined with the other surrounding small communities was close to 3,000 persons. Bearcreek and the surrounding communities had seven mercantiles, a bank, two hotels, two billiard halls, a brickyard, numerous saloons, and Bearcreek sported concrete sidewalks and their own water system. Allegedly, the town had no churches. The economy of Bear Creek was based on coal. The Smith Mine Disaster in 1943, followed by the decline in demand for coal in the late 1940s and 1950s caused the closure of the connecting railroad in 1953 and subsequently most of the coal mines, and the population declined steadily to less than 100 persons. Many buildings in Bearcreek and the surrounding communities were moved to other towns or demolished, and only a few structures remain.

The town is home to the Bearcreek Saloon which hosts fundraising pig races throughout the year. In addition, Bearcreek plays host every autumn to Montana Falconer Symposium, the state&#x27;s largest gathering of falcon trainers and birds of prey enthusiasts.

When the legality of betting on pig races was challenged, a law was passed—Montana Code Annotated 23-5-502(b) -- stating that &quot;Only a licensee of premises that are located in an incorporated city or town with a population of less than 100 or located outside the boundaries of an incorporated city or town and that are appropriately licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises under 23-5-119 may conduct a race between animals and conduct one or more sports pools on the race. The race may be conducted only if it is between pigs, gerbils, or hamsters and is conducted on the premises but outside of interior areas of the establishment where food and beverages are usually stored, prepared, or served.&quot;

Featured in the Star Trek Television series &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; Episode 1 of Season 1 as the home of Captain Christopher Pike. 

===The Montana Wyoming and Southern Railroad===
The Montana, Wyoming and Southern (or MW&amp;S) was an independent privately owned short rail spur built in 1906 from the main Northern Pacific Railroad (NP) line at Bridger, Montana through Belfry and on to the mines in and around Bearcreek. The tremendous amounts of coal extracted from the Bearcreek mines all traveled over this 21 mile long spur. The MW&amp;S was built by speculators hoping it could be immediately sold to the NP who used the high grade coal from the Bearcreek mines in their engines. However, since the MW&amp;S&#x27;s single outlet to the wider world was all through the NP terminus at Bridger, the Northern Pacific did not buy this short line but sought to control it through business interactions. The MW&amp;S was forced to operate on its own under constant financial pressure from the NP, and even though it shipped large volumes of high grade coal from Bearcreek it was often in financial and operational difficulties. The Bearcreek mine owners were in turn completely dependent on the MW&amp;S to move their shipments. The MW&amp;S existed as a vacillating and weak but critical link to the continued prosperity of the community of Bearcreek.

===Attraction of American and foreign born workers===
After the MW&amp;S railroad was built, Bearcreek expanded rapidly as coal production increased. American and foreign-born workers moved there, drawn by the expanding coal mining activity and the promise of steady work. By 1917, the mines around Bearcreek were employing 1,200 men. As the miners came they settled in small communities built in the small steep coulees running down into Bear Creek. At its peak, Bearcreek and the surrounding communities of Washoe, New Caledonia, Chickentown, Scotch Coulee, International, and Stringtown, had a population of about 3,000 people, most of whom worked in the coal mines.

From 1906 onward, Bearcreek attracted a large contingent of Serbian/Slavic immigrants from Serbia and Montenegro. The many Serb families brought their culture and their customs to Bearcreek. With its diverse ethnic composition, Bearcreek traditionally celebrated Christmas twice, on December 25 and January 6, the Serbian Orthodox Church holiday.

===Smith Mine Disaster===
On February 27, 1943, the Smith Mine #3 exploded in the worst coal mining accident in the history of Montana. Of the 77 men who had gone underground at the start of the shift, only 3 survived. The bodies were all recovered. Thirty had died instantly. Forty four of the miners survived the initial blast, but were trapped underground in isolated parts of the mine, dying from initial injuries or from suffocation from methane and carbon monoxide poisoning. Some left farewell notes to their families. The Smith Mine never reopened and this disaster dealt a severe blow to the community.

===Events after the Smith Mine Disaster===
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, there was a marked trend away from coal consumption in the American economy, due to utilization of natural gas or fuel oil for heating and the increasing use of diesel to power locomotives. Bearcreek&#x27;s coal production went into a steady decline.

After the abrupt closure of the Smith Mine, and as the demand for coal declined so did the financial health of the Montana, Wyoming and Southern, which had always been precarious. The railroad ceased to operate in 1953. When the railroad ceased to function so did most of mining activity in and around Bearcreek, since the railroad was the only efficient way for mines to ship their coal to market. Some mines struggled on, but the last mine closed in the 1970s. After the closure of the railroad followed by most of the mines the town&#x27;s population rapidly dwindled, eventually declining to under 100 people. The rails and ties were removed from the railroad bed and over time the many empty miners houses that once filled the coulees along Bear Creek were sold and moved, or they simply sat vacant and deteriorated until they were torn down.

Today, the many surrounding communities that made up Bearceek are almost completely gone, with only a few houses marking Washoe, currently the largest of them. In the last decades there is some growth of the tiny remaining community of Bearcreek thanks to its proximity to Red Lodge which has developed an economy to serve tourists who come to ski, or to use summer cabins, or to pass through to Yellowstone Park.

Belfry is predominantly an agricultural community. The primary crops are sugar beets, alfalfa, and feed corn. Ranchers raise cattle and sheep. Water for agricultural use comes mostly from the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River through several cooperative ditch companies, with water rights dating back 100 years or more.

At its peak in the early 1900s, a railway line came into Belfry, with a spur running up to the coal mines in Bearcreek. When the mines closed down and the railway line was removed, Belfry&#x27;s population dropped to its current level. Currently, the community has The Belfry Bar and Silvertip Bar/Casino.There are two antique stores and a picture frame shop called rr frame. The once open general store awhile ago is now closed.

The town was named for a local doctor. The post office was established on February 26, 1906, with Mary Hall as the first postmaster. The town was created by the construction of the Yellowstone Park Railroad.

<text>Red Lodge is a city and county seat of Carbon County, Montana, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 2,257.

==History==

On September 17, 1851, the United States government signed a treaty with the Crow Nation, confirming control of the area which now contains Red Lodge, MT to the Crow Indians. Rich coal deposits were found there in 1866, and gold was discovered nearby in 1870. An 1880 treaty between the U.S. government and the Crow allowed the area to be settled starting April 11, 1882.

The Red Lodge post office was established on December 9, 1884, with Postmaster Ezra L. Benton. A rail line was constructed into town, and coal shipments began in June 1889. The boundaries of the Crow Reservation were redrawn October 15, 1892, opening the whole area to settlement. From then until the 1930s, coal mining defined the town.

In the late 19th century, many new settlers came to Red Lodge, MT. The majority came from Italy, the British Isles, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. By the mid-1880s, migrants were still outnumbered by large numbers of Native Americans. By 1892 the population reached 1,180.

In 1896, Red Lodge had twenty saloons and, as the library records show, riotous and violent living was characteristic of the town. By 1906 the population had grown to 4,000 and by 1911 this had increased to 5,000.

Red Lodge suffered in the Great Depression, which forced many mines to close. To offset this downturn, the manufacture of illegal bootleg liquor, labeled syrup, became an economic mainstay and was sold as far away as Chicago and San Francisco.

In 1931 work began on the Beartooth Highway linking Red Lodge to Yellowstone National Park; it was officially opened in 1936.
In 1943 tragedy hit Smith Mine #3 near Bearcreek, the area&#x27;s largest remaining mine. An explosion trapped and killed 74 men with only three of the workers in the mine that day escaping, making it the worst coal mine disaster in Montana&#x27;s history. The mine was shut down shortly thereafter but was reopened in the late 1970s. The Red Lodge cemetery contains a memorial.

The downtown has been redeveloped since the mid-1980s for historic and cultural tourism, as the Red Lodge Commercial Historic District. The buildings in downtown Red Lodge fell into disrepair in large part because population had dropped from its 1915 peak of 6,000 people to about 2,000.

As of 2006, an estimate suggests that the population of Red Lodge may increase from about 1,200 people in the winter to over 1,800 people during the summer tourist season, arriving via the Beartooth Highway.

Red Lodge was heavily affected by the 2022 Montana floods.

==Geography==
Red Lodge is located adjacent to the Beartooth Mountains just to the south. Rock Creek flows along the eastern border. About 30 miles to the southwest of town, in the Custer Gallatin National Forest, is Granite Peak, the highest point in Montana. Grizzly Peak, of the Red Lodge Mountain ski area, is one of several mountains surrounding the town.

===Climate===
Red Lodge experiences a continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with cold, somewhat dry winters and warm, wetter summers. Summers are cooler than in areas of Montana further north, due to the high elevation. Winters however, are milder than areas further to the east due to the chinook wind influence, as with most of Montana.

<text>Great Falls is the third most populous city in the U.S. state of Montana and the county seat of Cascade County. The population was 60,442 according to the 2020 census. The city covers an area of and is the principal city of the Great Falls, Montana, Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses all of Cascade County. The Great Falls MSA&#x27;s population was 84,414 according to the 2020 census.
A cultural, commercial and financial center in the central part of the state, Great Falls is located just east of the Rocky Mountains and is bisected by the Missouri River. It is from the eastern entrance to Glacier National Park in northern Montana, and from Yellowstone National Park in southern Montana and northern Wyoming. A north–south federal highway, Interstate 15, serves the city.

Great Falls is named for a series of five waterfalls located on the Missouri River north and east of the city. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1805–1806 was forced to portage around a stretch of the river in order to bypass the falls; the company spent 31 days in the area, performing arduous labor to make the portage. Three of the waterfalls, known as Black Eagle, Rainbow and the Great Falls (or the Big Falls), are among the sites of five hydroelectric dams in the area, giving the city its moniker, “The Electric City”. Other nicknames for Great Falls include “The River City” and “Western Art Capital of the World”. The city is also home to two military installations: Malmstrom Air Force Base east of the city, which is the community&#x27;s largest employer; and the Montana Air National Guard to the west, adjacent to Great Falls International Airport. The federally recognized Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians of Montana are located in Great Falls.

Great Falls is a popular tourist destination in Montana, with one million overnight visitors annually, who spend an estimated $185 million while visiting, according to the Great Falls Montana Tourism group. Among Montana cities, Great Falls boasts the greatest number of museums, with 10, including the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center near Giant Springs and the C. M. Russell Museum and Original Log Cabin Studio on the city&#x27;s north side. Great Falls was the largest city in Montana from 1951 to 1970, when it was eclipsed by Billings in the 1970 census; Missoula assumed second place in 2000.

==History==
For much of prehistory, no permanent settlements existed at or near Great Falls, though Salish Indians seasonally hunted bison in the region. Around 1600, Piegan Blackfeet Indians, migrating west, entered the area, pushing the Salish back into the Rocky Mountains and claiming the area now occupied by Great Falls. The area remained territory of the Blackfeet until long after the United States claimed the region in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase.

Meriwether Lewis and William Clark led the Lewis and Clark Expedition into the newly purchased territory from 1804 to 1806. The expedition came upon the &quot;Great Falls of the Missouri River&quot; on June 13, 1805.
Politically, the future site of Great Falls passed through numerous hands in the 19th century. It was part of the unincorporated frontier until May 30, 1854, when Congress established the Nebraska Territory. On March 2, 1861, the site became part of the Dakota Territory. The Great Falls area was incorporated into the Idaho Territory on March 4, 1863, and then into the Montana Territory on May 28, 1864. It became part of the state of Montana upon that territory&#x27;s admission to statehood on November 8, 1889.

===Founding and early years===
The founding of Great Falls was the brainchild of Paris Gibson, a Maine-born entrepreneur who became acquainted with railroad magnate James J. Hill in Minneapolis, Minnesota. By the 1880s, Gibson was a sheep man in Fort Benton, Montana. He visited the Great Falls of the Missouri River in 1880 and was deeply impressed by the possibilities for building a major industrial city near the falls with power provided by hydroelectricity. He returned in 1883 with friend Robert Vaughn and some surveyors and platted a permanent settlement on the south side of the river. The city&#x27;s first citizen, Silas Beachley, arrived later that year. With investments from Hill and from Helena businessman Charles Arthur Broadwater, houses, a store, and a flour mill were established in 1884. The Great Falls post office was established on July 10, 1884, and Gibson was named the first postmaster. A planing mill, lumber yard, bank, school, and newspaper were established in 1885. By 1887 the town had 1,200 citizens, and the arrival of Hill&#x27;s Great Northern Railway in October of that year helped cement the city&#x27;s future. Great Falls was incorporated on November 28, 1888.

Great Falls quickly became a thriving industrial and supply center. A ground-breaking for a smelter in nearby Black Eagle took place in 1890, the same year that construction of a hydroelectric dam atop Black Eagle Falls was completed. The dam provided the fledgling city with electricity and marked the first major instance of hydroelectric power in Montana. In 1894, naturalist Vernon Bailey passed through and described Great Falls as &quot;a very good town, appears prosperous and booming &amp; I should judge contains 15000 inhabitants&quot;. By the early 1900s, Great Falls was en route to becoming one of Montana&#x27;s largest cities. The rustic studio of famed Western artist Charles Marion Russell was a popular attraction, as were the famed Great Falls of the Missouri.

Among structures built in the early years were the sandstone Central High School (completed in 1896), now the Paris Gibson Square Museum of Art; the ornate copper-domed Cascade County Courthouse (1903); and railroad passenger depots of the Great Northern Railway (1909) and the Milwaukee Road (1915), both overlooking the Missouri River.

===Railroad and hydroelectric expansion===
James Jerome Hill, president and primary stockholder of the Great Northern Railway, established a subsidiary, the Montana Central Railway, on January 25, 1886. The mines in Butte were eager to get their metals to market. Gold and silver had been discovered near Helena, and coal companies in Canada sought to transport their fuel to Montana&#x27;s smelters. Hill&#x27;s close friend and business associate, Paris Gibson, promoted Great Falls as a site for the development of cheap hydroelectricity and heavy industry. As Hill was building the Great Northern across the northern tier of Montana, it made sense to also build a north–south railroad through central Montana to connect Great Falls with Helena and Butte. Surveyors and engineers had begun grading a route between Helena and Great Falls in the winter of 1885–1886, and by the end of 1886 had surveyed a route from Helena to Butte.

Construction on the Great Northern&#x27;s line westward began in late 1886, and on October 16, 1887, the link between Devils Lake, North Dakota, Fort Assinniboine (near the present-day city of Havre, Montana), and Great Falls was complete. Service to Helena began in November 1887, and Butte followed on November 10, 1888.

Hill organized the Great Falls Water Power &amp; Townsite Company in 1887, with the goal of developing the town of Great Falls; providing it with power, sewage, and water; and attracting commerce and industry to the city. To attract industry to the new city, he offered low rates on the Montana Central Railway. On September 12, 1889, the Boston and Montana (&quot;B &amp; M&quot;) signed an agreement with Great Falls Water Power &amp; Townsite Company in which the power company agreed to build a dam that would supply the mining firm with at least 1,000 horsepower (or 0.75 MW) of power by September 1, 1890, and 5,000 horsepower (or 3.73 MW) of power by January 1, 1891. In exchange, B &amp; M agreed to build a $300,000 copper smelter near the dam. Black Eagle Dam began generating electricity in December 1890. Water was permitted to flow over the crest of the dam on January 6, 1891, and the dam was considered complete on March 15, 1891. By 1912, Rainbow Dam and Volta Dam (now Ryan Dam) were all operating. Morony Dam was built in 1930 and Cochrane Dam in 1957–1958.

====Smelting operations====
On April 7, 1908, construction began on a masonry/brick chimney measuring tall on the B &amp; M&#x27;s (now the city&#x27;s largest employer) smelting site at Black Eagle by the Alphonse Custodis Construction Co. of New York, for dispersal of fumes from B &amp; M&#x27;s copper smelting process. B &amp; M would soon merge with the Amalgamated Copper Company and become the Anaconda Copper Mining Company or &quot;ACM&quot;. The B &amp; M smelter stack was completed on October 23, 1908. The chimney had an interior measurement of in diameter at the base and in diameter at the top. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest chimney in the world (see List of tallest chimneys). With the moniker &quot;The Big Stack&quot;, it immediately became a landmark for the community; after over 70 years of operation, the smelter closed in 1980.

The Big Stack&#x27;s &quot;sister&quot; stack in Anaconda, also of masonry/brick construction, completed in 1919, and slightly taller at , began to suffer from cracking and the ACM decided to remove the support bands from the upper half of the Big Stack in 1976 and send them to Anaconda. This action proved to be the Big Stack&#x27;s ultimate demise, since the cracks it was also suffering from rapidly worsened such that the ACM, citing concern for public safety (due to the continual deterioration of the stack&#x27;s structural integrity), slated the Big Stack&#x27;s demolition for September 18, 1982.

In an interesting twist of fate, the demolition crew failed to accomplish the task on the first try; the two worst cracks in the stack ran from just above ground level to nearly up. The demolition team&#x27;s intent was to create a wedge in the base so the stack&#x27;s rubble would fall almost vertically into a large trench, but as the of explosives were set off the cracks &quot;completed themselves&quot; all the way to the ground—effectively severing the stack into two-thirds and one-third pieces. Much to the delight of the spectating community, the smaller of the two pieces remained standing, but the failed demolition only solidified the safety issue whereas the community cited the event as the stack&#x27;s defiance. The demolition team who had planted the charges was recalled and later the same afternoon they returned and finished the demolition, after packing another of explosives into the smaller wedge.

===1930–present===
During the first two decades of the 20th century, Great Falls prospered from a homesteading boom, strong agricultural markets and favorable weather. It also became a financial center and regional shopping hub. In the late 1930s, the federal government&#x27;s New Deal programs provided Great Falls with a new Civic Center building, and the city&#x27;s business sector expanded with the arrival of military installations during World War II, helping Great Falls become the state&#x27;s largest city from 1950 to 1970. During World War II, the Northwest Staging Route passed through Great Falls, along which planes were delivered to the USSR according to the Lend-Lease program. Great Falls prospered further with the opening of a nearby military base in the 1940s, but as rail transportation and freight slowed in the later part of the century, outlying farming areas lost population, and with the closure of the smelter and cutbacks at Malmstrom Air Force Base in the 1980s, its population growth slowed.

Great Falls was the location of the Mariana UFO incident in 1950, one of the earliest widely publicized UFO incidents.

On February 11, 2013, the residents of Great Falls were met with a false Emergency Alert System message during an afternoon broadcast of &quot;The Steve Wilkos Show&quot; on CBS affiliate television station KRTV, which simply stated that &quot;the bodies of the dead are rising from their graves and attacking the living. Do not attempt to approach these bodies, as they are considered extremely dangerous.&quot; It was revealed that a default password for the networks was being used, and a few minutes later, the station sent an official on-screen message apologizing for any confusion.

In recent years, the economy of Great Falls has suffered from the decline of heartland industry, much like other cities in the Great Plains and Midwest.

== Geography ==

Great Falls is located near several waterfalls on the Missouri River. It lies near the center of Montana on the northern Great Plains. It lies next to the Rocky Mountain Front and is approximately south of the Canada–US border. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

=== Geology ===
The city of Great Falls lies atop the Great Falls Tectonic Zone, an intracontinental shear zone between two geologic provinces of basement rock of the Archean period which form part of the North American continent. The city lies at the southern reach of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, a vast glacial sheet of ice which covered much of North America during the last glacial period. Approximately 1.5 million years ago, the Missouri River flowed northward into a terminal lake. The Laurentide Ice Sheet pushed the river southward. Between 15,000 BCE and 11,000 BCE, the Laurentide Ice Sheet blocked the Missouri River and created Glacial Lake Great Falls. About 13,000 BCE, as the glacier retreated, Glacial Lake Great Falls emptied catastrophically in a glacial lake outburst flood. The current course of the Missouri River essentially marks the southern boundary of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The Missouri River flowed eastward around the glacial mass, settling into its present course. As the ice retreated, meltwater from Glacial Lake Great Falls poured through the Highwood Mountains and eroded the mile-long, Shonkin Sag, one of the most famous prehistoric meltwater channels in the world.

===Climate===
Great Falls has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;), with a notable amount of summer precipitation occurring in the form of thunderstorms. Winters are very cold, long and often snowy, though periods of chinook winds do cause warm spells and raise the maximum temperature above on an average of fifteen afternoons during the three-month winter period. In the absence of such winds, shallow cold snaps are common; there is an average of 20.8 nights with a low of or colder and 44 days failing to top freezing. The wettest part of the year is the spring. Summers are hot and dry, with highs reaching on nineteen days per year, though the diurnal temperature variation is large and easily exceeds . Freak early and late summer snowfalls such as a two-day total of in August 1992 can occur, although the median snowfall from June to September is zero and on average the window for accumulating () snowfall is October 2–May 13.

==Economy==
===Historic economy===

Built as a railroad hub, Great Falls initially relied heavily on ore smelting in its early years. Black Eagle Dam, opened in 1890, was the first hydroelectric dam built in Montana and the first built on the Missouri River. The energy industry helped give the city of Great Falls the nickname &quot;The Electric City&quot;. The same year, the Boston and Montana Consolidated Copper and Silver Mining Company broke ground on a large smelter in the city, drawn to the location by the power provided by the dam. Elements came online over the next few years, with the final works—an electrolytic refinery and blast furnaces—completed in February and April 1893. By 1892, more than 1,000 workers were employed at the smelter. Energy production received a boost with the discovery of petroleum about north of the city in the late 1910s. Great Falls boasted two oil refineries by 1920, although a devastating fire left the city with just one after 1929.

Great Falls suffered its first major economic crisis in 1893. Banks and industry in the city were severely undercapitalized, and the Panic of 1893 cut off access to money in the east. The price of silver collapsed and nearby mines closed. Markets for beef, mutton, and wool largely disappeared, leaving area ranchers destitute. A large number of businesses in Great Falls shut their doors. The city was largely saved by the smelter, which continued to employ about 900 workers from 1895 to 1900. A North Montana Agricultural Society was formed to bring improvements in the practice of cattle ranching and wheat farming, and to lobby for federal- and state-funded irrigation projects. An attempt to win state legislative approval for an official state fair to be located at Great Falls failed in 1894, but organizers were successful in holding the first Cascade County Fair in May 1895.
The city became even more prominent as an agricultural products center. Wheat production began to soar in Montana during the 1906-1907 growing season, and by 1920 there were 11 railroad spur lines radiating from the city to collect the grain from local farmers. The city&#x27;s easy access to inexpensive electrical power made it ideal for grain milling and meat refrigeration, and enabled Great Falls to become a major center for farmers and ranchers. The Royal Milling Company was founded in Great Falls in 1892, and within seven years was making half the flour in the state. It tripled its capacity to per day in 1917, then in 1928 merged with about 25 other mills nationwide to form General Mills. Montana Flour Mills opened its Great Falls facility in 1916, and had a capacity of per day in 1920. Royal had a regional grain storage capacity in 1920 of more than , while Montana Flour&#x27;s approached . Brewing became a major industry in the city, with the 1892 Montana Brewing Company (makers of Great Falls Select beer) leading the way. The city&#x27;s close proximity to Montana&#x27;s cattle-rich Judith Basin also led to the development of a large meat packing industry. Led by the Great Falls Meat Co., Needham Packing Company, Stafford Meat Co., Valley Meat Market, and other slaughterhouses, Great Falls was the largest meat packing center between Spokane, Washington, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, by the 1930s.

The city&#x27;s population boomed, reaching 30,000 by 1913. The 145-bed Columbus Hospital (a Catholic Church-owned facility) opened in 1892 and the 330-bed Montana Deaconess Medical Center (originally a Methodist Episcopal Church facility) opened in 1898, making the city a destination for those with serious healthcare needs for central Montana. During the 1910s, Great Falls became known as a regional banking city, with three national- and three state-chartered banks (although just two national and one state bank would survive the Great Depression). Large regional deposits of clay, coal, gypsum, limestone, and sandstone led to the emergence of large brick works, cement works, plaster works, and stone cutting facilities in the town.

A major drought hit the counties north of the Missouri River in 1917, and spread to the rest of the state in 1918. Massive swarms of locusts struck the state in 1919, and in 1920 strong, steady winds eroded the topsoil, damaging the productivity of the soil and creating a &quot;dust bowl&quot; effect. Montana farmers were therefore largely unable to take advantage of the high price of wheat and other agricultural products created by wartime demand and the loss of agricultural output in Europe caused by World War I. The drought did not end: Just six of the 13 years from 1917 to 1930 saw average or above-average precipitation in the state. As agricultural production in Europe recovered after 1920, war-inflated agricultural prices collapsed. The high costs associated with the Great Falls-area underground coal mines led to the collapse of this local industry in the 1920s as well, devastating Great Falls coal dealers and shippers. Although the post–World War I recession lifted nationally by 1922, the economy of Great Falls and the rest of the state remained mired in depression until the mid-1920s.

The city&#x27;s economy stagnated during the Great Depression. The price of copper fell by nearly 75 percent to just 5 cents a pound between 1929 and 1933. Anaconda cut production in the state by 75 percent and closed its plant in Great Falls, throwing hundreds out of work. Agricultural prices, too, collapsed. Half of the state&#x27;s farmers lost their land to foreclosure, and 60,000 of the 80,000 homesteaders who had arrived between 1900 and 1917 left the state. By the time the Great Depression ended in 1940, 11,000 farms (20 percent of the state&#x27;s total) had been abandoned and of farmland had gone out of cultivation. Even as the national population grew by 16 percent between 1930 and 1940, Montana&#x27;s population declined. Great Falls was one of the rare places in Montana which saw population growth. The city grew from 28,822 residents in 1930 to 29,928 residents in 1940.
World War II saw the establishment of East Base (now Malmstrom Air Force Base) in Great Falls in 1941, which proved to be a turning point economically. The war not only created a huge demand for the agricultural products and metal products provided by the city but also fueled significant population growth in Great Falls. The base brought 4,000 new residents to the city; by 1943, the city&#x27;s population had shot up by about 5,600 to 35,000. These new residents created a huge demand for goods and services, and a large number of new businesses sprang up to supply the base with its needs. The rapid population growth created a housing construction boom in Great Falls. The federal government paid for the construction of 300 new single-family homes during the war, although this was nowhere near the amount of new housing needed. East Base created a fundamental cultural and social shift in the city, one which became more pronounced over time as active-duty personnel stayed in the city after retirement. The war also saw a major improvement to the Great Falls Municipal Airport. The 1928 facility received its first air traffic control tower in 1942, paid for by the federal government after the vast increase in flights over the city after the construction of the new air base.
By 1950, Great Falls was Montana&#x27;s largest city, having added 33 percent more residents during the 1940s. Much of the city&#x27;s growth was due to rising federal investment in defense and healthcare, and it was an important regional convention, trade, and medical center. In 1951, Anaconda consolidated its statewide zinc production in Great Falls, adding substantial numbers of new workers, and in 1955 opened an aluminum smelter in the city. The O.S. Warden Bridge opened in 1951. Designed to turn a then-mostly undeveloped 10th Avenue S. into a straight-line bypass through the city, Extraordinary increases in traffic on 10th Avenue S. led the state to transform the two-lane street in 1956 into an wide four-lane highway with a central median. Previously an undeveloped area with only the occasional residence, the 1956 changes to 10th Avenue S. turned the highway into a vibrant business district. Construction of the new campus of the College of Great Falls began on 10th Avenue S. in 1959, and the new Deaconess Hospital in 1963. 10th Avenue S. received its first traffic signals in 1964.

Great Falls&#x27; reputation as a retail hub for central Montana emerged in the 1960s. The Holiday Village Mall opened as an open-air shopping center in 1959, and by 1969 had expanded to become a modern enclosed shopping mall. Westgate Mall opened in 1965, Agri-Village Warehouse (later Agri-Village Shopping Center) in 1967, and Evergreen Mall in 1983. The city was one of Montana&#x27;s most important agricultural equipment sales and distribution hubs, and the Great Falls Livestock Commission Company (established in 1936) had become an important multistate livestock auction center.

In the 1960s, Great Falls&#x27; economic future appeared bright. The city&#x27;s population reached 55,357 in 1960, an 85 percent increase since 1940. It was one of the fastest-growing cities in the nation. Including the adjacent unincorporated town of Black Eagle, Malmstrom Air Force Base personnel, and certain minor adjacent residential blocks, the population was estimated to be more than 72,000 by 1964. The largest city in Montana in 1965, state planning agencies believed Great Falls would have a population of 100,000 by 1981.

The economy of Great Falls began a significant diminution in the 1970s. The nation of Chile nationalized Anaconda Copper&#x27;s extensive, lucrative copper mines in 1971, causing the company to suffer massive financial losses. It closed its Great Falls zinc operation in 1971, and the rest of the smelter in 1980. About 1,450 high-wage Anaconda employees lost their jobs during the decade. Changes in the defense posture of the United States led to significant cutbacks at Malmstrom Air Force Base as well. These included the loss of 476 airmen and officers in 1972, 30 airmen in 1974, 1,015 airmen and officers in 1979, 100 airmen in 1981, 30 airmen in 1982, and 360 airmen and officers in 1983. The job losses stripped $18.2 million from the local economy in 1985 alone. The base lost another 1,017 jobs between 1992 and 1996.

===Current economy===
Since the Great Recession of 2008–2010, the Great Falls economy proved sluggish, growing at an annual rate of 0.9 percent, compared to a statewide average of 1.8 percent and a national rate of 2.0 percent. Growth was strongest in construction and manufacturing, followed by back-office business services (such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Montana&#x27;s new insurance claims processing center), healthcare (such as the opening of the Great Falls Clinic Hospital), retail sales, social welfare (such as the opening of the Cameron Family Center, which houses 26 homeless families), and tourism. The city&#x27;s lack of population growth, coupled with low commodity prices for agricultural producers, has significantly hindered growth in the city for two decades.

The lack of growth worsened poverty in the city. There were no neighborhoods of concentrated poverty in the city in 2010, but by 2016 1,254 city residents lived in such areas. The number of Great Falls residents living in poverty during the same period rose by 10.37 percent (1,100 people), for a citywide poverty rate of 19.9 percent. Great Falls suffered from more concentrated poverty than any other city in the state.

Low economic and population growth have also harmed real estate values in the city. While the median price of a home in five other large Montana cities (Billings, Bozeman, Helena, Kalispell, and Missoula) was $262,960 ($ in dollars) in 2017, it was just $169,500 ($ in dollars) in Great Falls during the same period. (That is $93,460, or 35.5 percent, less.) The median price of a home statewide in Montana during that period was $217,200 ($ in dollars), with Great Falls home prices $47,700, or 22 percent, less.

A 2016 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Development at the University of Montana predicted the city&#x27;s economy would be driven by manufacturing, retail sales, and tourism over the next several years. The city had long tried to rebuild its agricultural processing industry, and egg production and specialty milling both saw expanded operations in the city in 2015. In 2016, the city won an $8 million grant from the state of Montana to open a Food and Ag Development Center (only one of four in Montana). Working with BNSF Railway, the city&#x27;s development agency converted of disused railroad yard into a full service heavy industrial food and agricultural processing site. Named AgriTech Park, the site won an Excellence in Regional Transportation Award from the National Association of Development Organizations. FedEx Ground, Helena Chemical, Montana Specialty Mills, Pacific Steel and Recycling, and Cargill all took space in the park by the end of 2018.

===Military===
Great Falls is home to Malmstrom Air Force Base and the 341st Missile Wing. The 341st Operations Group provides the forces to launch, monitor and secure the wing&#x27;s Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and missile alert facilities (MAF). These ICBMs and MAFs are dispersed over the largest missile complex in the Western Hemisphere, an area encompassing some (approximately the size of the state of West Virginia). The group manages a variety of equipment, facilities, and vehicles worth more than $5 billion.

Also at Malmstrom are the 819th RED HORSE Squadron (reactivated August 8, 1997) and the 219th RED HORSE Squadron Montana Air National Guard. Both units are rapid deployment units, and are the first &quot;associate&quot; RED HORSE squadrons in the Air Force, staffed by approximately two-thirds active-duty military and one-third Air National Guard personnel.

Great Falls International Airport is home to multiple military units, including the Montana Air National Guard&#x27;s 120th Airlift Wing, which is composed of C-130H cargo aircraft and associated support personnel. Two U.S. Army Reserve units, the 364th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) and the 889th Quartermaster Company also call the airport home.

==Arts and culture==

Great Falls has a symphony orchestra, founded in 1959, which performs concert series, sponsors the youth orchestras the Cascade String Quartet and Chinook Winds Quintet, offers chamber ensembles, and offers an educational outreach program.

The community also is notable for the unique Sip &#x27;n Dip Lounge, a tiki bar located downtown in the O&#x27;Haire Motor Inn. Built in 1962, it features an indoor swimming pool visible through a window in the bar where women dressed as mermaids swim underwater. In 2003, &quot;GQ&quot; magazine rated the lounge as one of the top 10 bars in the world, and the #1 bar in the world &quot;worth flying for&quot;. With the added feature of an octogenarian piano player named &quot;Piano Pat&quot;, noted for her &quot;unusual covers&quot; of songs by Frank Sinatra and other performers of the 1960s, Frommer&#x27;s travel guide calls it &quot;one of the kitschiest, wackiest, and flat-out coolest nightspots, not just in Montana, but in the entire West&quot;.

===Four Seasons Arena===
The Four Seasons Arena is a multi-purpose indoor sports and exhibition arena located in the city of Great Falls, Montana, in the United States. Constructed in 1979, it served primarily as an ice rink until 2005. The failure of the practice rink&#x27;s refrigeration system in 2003 and the management&#x27;s decision to close the main rink in 2006 led to the facility&#x27;s reconfiguration as an indoor sports and exhibition space. As of May 2011 it was the largest exhibition, music, and sports venue in the city.

==Sports==
For the 1979–80 WHL season, Great Falls and the Four Seasons Arena was the home of the Great Falls Americans hockey team (see below). The team was 2–25 before folding. Great Falls has a rich baseball history with the Voyagers. Formerly called the White Sox, Dodgers and Giants, baseball players such as Pedro Martínez, José Offerman, and Raúl Mondesí have spent time in Great Falls with the team. Since 1988, the team has won the Pioneer League championship six times (1988, 1989, 1990, 2002, 2008, and 2011). In 2007, the Great Falls Explorers basketball team were the CBA National Conference Runner-up.

Great Falls has been home to the Great Falls Americans Junior A ice hockey team since the 2011–2012 season.

Great Falls was home to the Great Falls Gladiators semi-professional football team which played in the Rocky Mountain Football League.

==Government==
The city has a commission-manager form of government. The commission is composed of the mayor and four elected commissioners. The mayor serves a two-year term. Cory Reeves became mayor in 2024. The commissioners are elected to overlapping four-year terms.

==Education==

The Great Falls Public Schools system, including both elementary and high school districts, covers the entire city.

The elementary school district and high school district have the same territory, and include: Great Falls, Black Eagle, Gibson Flats, Malmstrom Air Force Base, and portions of Sun Prairie and Ulm.

There are 20 schools within the system. These include two public high schools, an alternative high school, two middle schools, and 15 elementary schools. The two public high schools are Great Falls High School and Charles M. Russell High School. The alternative high school is Paris Gibson Education Center, located in the former Paris Gibson Junior High School building. The two middle schools are North Middle School and East Middle School.

The state-operated Montana School for the Deaf &amp; Blind is in Great Falls.

Great Falls also is home to many private schools, all of them sponsored by religious organizations. The Catholic Church sponsors several schools in the city, including Great Falls Montessori (grades Pre-K to K), Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School (Pre-K to grade 8), Holy Spirit Catholic School (Pre-K to grade 8), and Great Falls Central Catholic High School (grades 9 to 12). The Conservative Baptist Association of America sponsors two schools in the city: Heritage Baptist School (K to grade 9) and Treasure State Baptist Academy (Pre-K to grade 12). The Seventh-day Adventist Church also sponsors two schools: Adventist Christian (grades 1 to 8) and Five Falls Christian Church (grades 1 to 8). There is also a nondenominational Christian school, Foothills Community Christian School (Pre-K to grade 12).

Great Falls is home to three institutions of higher education. Great Falls College Montana State University is a two-year public institution of higher learning. It was founded as the Great Falls Vocational-Technical Center in 1969, and received its current name after the state restructured the two-year comprehensive colleges in the state in 2012. Although a public institution since its creation, it became part of the Montana University System in 1994. The University of Providence, formerly named the University of Great Falls, a private, four-year Catholic university, was founded in 1932 by the Sisters of Providence and the Ursuline Sisters. Apollos University is a private, distance education university, founded in 2005 and headquartered in Great Falls since 2016. Also opening in July 2023 will be a school of Osteopathic Medicine from the New York-based Touro University System, the first Medical School in Montana. It will operate as TouroCOM Montana under the Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine (TouroCOM) branding and will be the fifth school of Osteopathic Medicine and sixth overall Medical School (five Osteopathic and one Allopathic) under the Touro University System.

<text>Neihart is a town in Cascade County, Montana, United States. It is located in the center of Little Belt Mountains. The population was 43 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Great Falls, Montana, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
The town has a total area of , all land. Its elevation is .
Neihart is on U.S. Route 89, also known as the Kings Hill Scenic Byway. Snow removal crews work throughout the winter to keep the road open. It is the only town between Monarch to the north and White Sulphur Springs to the south. The Lewis and Clark National Forest surrounds the town. The ski area at Showdown, Montana is nearby and takes advantage of the mountainous terrain. Just south of Neihart, Route 89 begins to follow Sawmill Creek. The highway then climbs toward King&#x27;s Hill, a major pass through the Little Belt Mountains.

===Geology===
The Neihart area is rich in mineral deposits. Gold, lead, sapphires, silver, and zinc have all been discovered and mined in the area. Much of the exposed rock in the area is dated to the Precambrian era, or around or before 542 million BC. Rocks in the area belong to what is known as the Belt Supergroup and rest against granitic gneiss. Amethyst and marine fossils are common in the area. Pinto diorite, a red-and-green spotted diorite, is found in large quantities in the area.

The area is one of only three places in the world where Neihart quartzite (a reddish, coarse-grained sandstone with interbedded dark-green sandstone and shale) may be found. The rock unit was named for the locality.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Neihart has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

==History==

On October 20, 1879, E.A. &quot;Buck&quot; Barker and Patrick Hughes, two prospectors, discovered silver ore on Galena Creek in the Little Belt Mountains. The mining towns of Barker, Galena Creek, and Hughesville soon sprang up in the area. Among the many small mining camps which were erected was Jericho, which soon went bust. In July 1881, three prospectors from Barker—James LeRoy Neihart, John O&#x27;Brien, and Richard Harley—discovered silver near the present-day town of Neihart and established the Queen of the Mountains Mine. When the news reached Barker, several parties of prospectors headed for the area and established a new mining camp on Belt Creek named Canyon City. Canyon City was later renamed Neihart after the aforementioned James LeRoy Neihart, who was also an uncle of poet John Neihardt. The mining district was never formally organized, but for many years was called the &quot;Montana District&quot;. More than 40 mines operated in the area over the next 75 years.

In 1882, the town was large enough for the United States Post Office Department to establish a post office there. A road to White Sulphur Springs was constructed shortly thereafter, although ore was packed out by mule to Barker and smelted there. When the Barker smelter closed in 1883, a new smelter was built close to Neihart at the Mountain Chief Mine in 1885. By this time, the town featured a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, a boarding house, restaurants, two saloons, and stables. About 50 houses had been built in Neihart, although many residents still lived in tents. From 1882 to 1929, about $16 million in silver was taken out of the area around Neihart. The Galt and Broadwater mines were dug in 1883, and a year later the Ball and Mountain Chief mines were in operation. The M and I, Rochester, and Silver Dyke mines also opened near Neihart. Despite the area&#x27;s rich ore deposits, investment in mining in the Neihart region remained low due to the expense of ore extraction. In 1887, these early mines largely shut down, as most of the richest and easily accessible veins of ore had been exhausted. By 1890, Neihart was almost deserted.

On November 15, 1891, a spur of the Montana Central Railway reached Neihart, and a strong mining boom began. Now even low-grade ore could be easily and cheaply shipped to the huge smelter in Great Falls. The Panic of 1893 wiped out the area&#x27;s mining economy, but the town continued to exist. This was largely because some mines, such as the Benton, Big Seven, and Florence, continued in operation.

Neihart went through a series of booms and busts over the next half-century. Mining booms occurred during and after World War I, in 1929, and in 1935. The 1935 boom was built primarily around zinc mining, and Neihart continued to be a major source for zinc during World War II. In 1939, the town&#x27;s population was 168. After World War II, the rail spur was abandoned and the track removed.

Portions of Neihart have been abandoned, and ghost town ruins can be seen in the city&#x27;s outer limits, among them being Wu Tang&#x27;s former laundry and drug store. The remains of Jericho can also still be found in Neihart.

<text>Vaughn is a census-designated place (CDP) in Cascade County, Montana, United States. The population was 737 at the 2020 census, compared to 658 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Great Falls, Montana Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is named for Montana pioneer Robert Vaughn, whose homestead on the Vaughn Ranch encompassed part of the town.

==History==
While trying to make his fortune gold mining in Nelson Gulch near what is now Helena, Montana, Welsh American immigrant Robert Vaughn became convinced that Montana was excellent ranching and farming country. In the fall of 1869, he traveled into Chouteau County, Montana, which at the time covered nearly a sixth of the state. About upstream from where the Sun River joined the Missouri River, he decided to homestead. He returned to Helena and filed paperwork to claim the land, and learned he was the first individual to formally file for a homestead in Chouteau County. Although Vaughn started out farming, he quickly turned to ranching. He imported a large number of pure-bred cattle and horses, and his horses were some of the best in the state.

Vaughn&#x27;s young wife, Elizabeth, died of complications from childbirth on January 13, 1888. Devastated by her death, Vaughn determined to sell his ranch and move into nearby Great Falls. Vaughn sold his ranch in 1890 to &quot;Captain&quot; Thomas Couch, a Cornish immigrant and expert miner who managed the Boston and Montana Consolidated Copper and Silver Mining Company in Great Falls.

In 1890, the North Western Coal and Navigation Company constructed the Great Falls &amp; Canada Railway, a narrow-gauge railway () which ran from Sweet Grass, Montana (at the Canada–US border) to a terminus adjacent to the Robert Vaughn Ranch. Designed to carry coal to Lethbridge, Alberta, the railroad was dubbed the &quot;Turkey Trail&quot;. The railroad led to settlement around the terminus, and in 1910 Couch platted a town there. This town he named Vaughn, after Robert Vaughn.

<text>Big Sandy is a town in Chouteau County, Montana, United States. The population was 605 at the 2020 census. 

The Lewis and Clark Trail, following U.S. Route 87, goes through Big Sandy. 

Big Sandy native Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam bassist, built the town a skatepark with his Montana Pool Service non-profit organization in 2010.

Big Bud 747, claimed to be the largest farm tractor in the world, was located here from 1997 until 2009, and returned in 2020.

==History==
At one time the site of a saloon that served Missouri River freighters, the community of Big Sandy is named for nearby Big Sandy Creek. The town began in 1887 with the arrival of the St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Manitoba Railway (later the Great Northern Railway). By early 1900, Cornelius J. McNamara and Thomas A. Marlow, owners of the McNamara Cattle Company, had opened the town&#x27;s first store. Homesteaders began arriving in Big Sandy in 1909, and an influx continued for a decade. 

Several stories explain the creek&#x27;s name. The most colorful involves a muleskinner, “Big Sandy” Lane, who arrived one day near the present townsite and, to his dismay, discovered the creek at flood stage. He cursed the uncooperative weather, his bad luck, and the flooded creek crossing so fluently that the offending stream dried up immediately and he was able to cross. 

For decades Big Sandy&#x27;s primary landmark was the town water tower, which was visible for many miles. The water tower was dismantled in 1993. As of 2019 some local and former residents have banded together to establish a particularly charismatic and recurring puddle on Main Street (which has been dubbed, simply, &quot;Puddle&quot;) as a new and recognizable landmark of the municipality. Two of the higher profile natives of Big Sandy, Craig Edwards and Steve Sibra, are among those who actively promote &quot;Puddle&quot; as a body of water of consequence.

The population was 1,449 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Established in 1846 as Fort Lewis and relocated 15 miles downstream in 1847 by Alexander Culbertson, who worked for Auguste Chouteau and Pierre Chouteau, Jr. of St. Louis, the original fort was the last fur trading post on the Upper Missouri River, which soon made it an important economic center. For 30 years, the port attracted steamboats carrying goods, merchants, gold miners and settlers, coming from New Orleans, Memphis, St. Louis, Hannibal, Bismarck, and Kansas City, among other places. As the eastern terminus for the 642-mile-long Mullan Road, completed by the United States Army in 1860, and at the head of navigation of the Missouri River, Fort Benton was part of the overland link between the Missouri and the Columbia River, with its own head of navigation at Fort Walla Walla in Washington. Twenty thousand migrants used the road to travel to the Northwest in its first year. It became an important route for miners from both directions going into the interior of Idaho and north to Canada. Steamboat travel to Fort Benton from St. Louis, Missouri, helped broadly fuel the development of the American West between 1860 and 1890, when it was supplanted by railroad transport. The river was an important route for miners to the newly discovered gold fields of southern Montana at what became Bannack and Virginia City beginning in 1862, and Helena beginning in 1865.

With the decline of the fur trade, the American Fur Company sold the fort to the Northwest Fur Company in 1865, and the fort became a U.S. Army post from 1868 until the army units departed in 1881. Founder Alexander Culbertson formally named it Fort Benton on Christmas Day 1850, in honor of Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri. Beginning in the early 1860s, with the arrival of the first steamboats, a town began to grow up around the fort. Besides being one of the most important ports on the Missouri-Mississippi river system, Fort Benton was once the &quot;World&#x27;s Innermost Port&quot; – the furthest point of navigable water on the Missouri River. It was served by numerous well-known &quot;mountain boats&quot; (designed specifically for the Missouri River), including the &quot;Yellowstone&quot; and the &quot;Far West&quot;, and their famed captains, Joseph LaBarge and Grant Marsh, respectively.

Fort Benton&#x27;s importance in trade was superseded by the construction of transcontinental railroads in the late 19th century. In 1867, Fort Benton was the site where Union General Thomas Francis Meagher, then acting governor of Montana Territory, fell overboard from his steamboat and drowned in the river; his body was never recovered.

=== Conflict with Natives ===
In 1869, Mountain Chief, then Chief of the Pikuni Blackfeet Indians, travelled to the town of Fort Benton to request the agent of his reservation to remove illegal whiskey traders from Blackfeet land. The chief was physically assaulted by a gang of white residents. In the same year, Mountain Chief&#x27;s brother and a teenage boy were assassinated in Fort Benton, supposedly in retaliation for the death of a white cattle rancher near to the town. In both cases, officials neglected to file criminal charges on behalf of these three Blackfeet Indians. In 1870, a group of 10 Blackfeet Indians would be killed by Fort Benton soldiers and vigilantes for the alleged crime of cattle raiding.

==Geography==

Fort Benton is located off U.S. Route 87

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The community sits in a narrow river valley on the west bank of the Missouri River and is in a geographic area known as the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; (one of several dozen folk regions of Montana) due to the strength of the wheat industry of the region. For example, in 2007, Chouteau County was one of two counties in the United States with the highest wheat production. The long summer days (due to being at almost 48 degrees N latitude) and fertile soil of the area (due in part to ash deposits from the Elkhorn Volcanics to the south) leads to exceptionally &quot;hard&quot; wheat (high protein content) thriving in the area.

===Climate===
Fort Benton experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold, dry winters and hot, wetter summers. On July 5, 1988, the Fort Benton area was struck by an F3 tornado that injured two people.

Whitetail Reservoir, a state fishing access site, is located &quot;7 miles north of Flaxville on Highway 511.&quot;
The town&#x27;s R-Y Trail Bar is named after a historic route. Merv Blevins, who farms in Bengough, Saskatchewan and Flaxville, Montana, describes the K-Y Trail as follows:

“The road that runs from Regina down to Miles City follows Highway 34 [which becomes Highway 511 in Montana] ... (it was used) when they were doing cattle drives and things back in the day, but it’s also used by our Native Americans to come up to the turtle effigy that’s located just south east of Big Beaver, that’s a holy sight for them and they come there and they have a sweat lodge there every once in awhile and they use the port of Big Beaver.”
== History ==
&quot;Flaxville was originally founded as Boyer, about 2.5 miles southwest of where the town is now.&quot; It was named after &quot;the Henry Boyer family at whose home the early railroad construction workers were fed.&quot; The current town was founded in 1913 following the arrival of a Great Northern Railway branch line that eventually ran from Bainville to Opheim. &quot;The first post office was established in 1914 with Martha Bledsoe as postmaster.&quot;

The name refers to the abundance of flax grown in the area. There are grain elevators beside the railroad tracks running through town.

The town was incorporated in 1955. It is home to the Daniels County Chapter of Pheasants Forever, The Barn Theater, Country Roads Mini Horses, and the R-Y Trail Bar.

Printmaker Don Bunse (1934 - 1994), who taught at University of Montana and developed collagraphy with a group of artists, was born in Flaxville. &quot;He was a delegate for the University of Montana in the first academic art exchange between the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.&quot;

<text>Glendive is a city in and the county seat of Dawson County, Montana, United States, and home to Dawson Community College. Glendive was established by the Northern Pacific Railway when they built the transcontinental railroad across the northern tier of the western United States from Minnesota to the Pacific Coast. The town was the headquarters for the Yellowstone Division that encompassed ; in main line and in branches with the main routes from Mandan, North Dakota, to Billings, Montana, and from Billings to Livingston. The town of Glendive is an agricultural and ranching hub of eastern Montana sited between the Yellowstone River and the Badlands. Makoshika State Park is located just east of Glendive.

The population was 4,873 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Sir George Gore, a wealthy Irish sportsman, named the local tributary to the Yellowstone River in his favorite hunting area &quot;Glendive&quot; in 1855. The town later took its name from the stream of the same name.

Glendive was established by the Northern Pacific Railway during the building of the railroad line. The settlement mainly consisted of tents and log cabins until a building boom ensued with the arrival of first load of lumber in 1881.

The Montana territorial legislature created Dawson County in 1869 but did not name a county seat, instead placing it administratively under Meagher County. In 1881, Glendive citizens petitioned to name it the county seat.

In January 2015, Glendive was the site of a major oil spill from a pipeline which also contaminated drinking water.

On October 24, 2023, a fire destroyed the Jordan Inn and the Rose Theater, both located in the Merrill Avenue Historic District. The Inn was a complete loss.

<text>Lewistown is a city in and the county seat of Fergus County, Montana, United States. The population was 5,952 at the 2020 census. Lewistown is located in the geographic center of the state, southeast of Great Falls and northwest of Billings. First planned in 1882, it was the site of an 1880s gold rush, and served as an important railway destination, supplying surrounding communities with bricks via rail.

==History==
The area was the territory of the Blackfoot Native Americans. In 1874, Fort Lewis was established there by Company &quot;F&quot; of the 7th U.S. Infantry to provide military protection for people traveling on the Carroll Trail, then the shortest route between Carroll, Montana and Helena. Lewistown is named after this fort.

The first permanent settlers of Lewistown were Métis. The Metis established Lewistown in 1879. Pierre Berger is credited with being the founder of Lewistown. Berger, along with his wife Judith Wilkie Berger, son Isadore Berger, Isaie Berger, Jean Baptiste Berger and Jacques Berger, as well as several other families made the trek into the Lewistown area in 1879. Francis Janeaux came with the second group. Janeaux founded the first public school house in 1883. Lewistown became an incorporated city in 1899.

Lewistown was the site of a gold rush when gold was discovered in the nearby Judith Mountains in 1880. Before the gold rush, Maiden was the largest city in central Montana. When the gold supply ran out, many of the miners gained new employment in Lewistown and settled there permanently.

Lewistown was the eastern terminus of the Montana Railroad which connected with Lombard, Montana, a distance of approximately . The railroad connected with the national railway network via a connection with the Northern Pacific Railway at Lombard. The Montana Railroad line was constructed between 1895 and 1903, and operated independently until 1908, when it was acquired by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (&quot;the Milwaukee Road&quot;).

During World War II, in 1942 the US Army Air Corps established a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress training base just west of Lewistown to train aircrews for missions in North Africa and Europe. The former airbase is now the Lewistown Municipal Airport, which is home to the last remaining Norden bombsight storage facility, used to keep the device safe from theft by enemy spies during World War II . The city park displays a Minuteman III ballistic missile.
