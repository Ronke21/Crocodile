<text>Union City is a city in the northern part of Hudson County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city was the state&#x27;s 18th-most-populous municipality, with a population of 68,589, an increase of 2,134 (+3.2%) from the 2010 census count of 66,455, which in turn had reflected a decline of 633 (−0.9%) from the 67,088 counted in the 2000 census. As of the 2010 Census, among cities with a population of more than 50,000, it was the most densely populated city in the United States, with a density of 54,138 per square mile of land. The Census Bureau&#x27;s Population Estimates Program calculated that the city&#x27;s population was 65,366 in 2022, ranking the city the 590th-most-populous in the country.

Union City was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on June 1, 1925, with the merger of Union Hill and West Hoboken Township.

Two major waves of immigration, first of German speakers and then of Spanish speakers, greatly influenced the development and character of Union City. Its two nicknames, &quot;Embroidery Capital of the United States&quot; and &quot;Havana on the Hudson&quot;, reflect important aspects of that history. Thousands visit Union City each year to see the nation&#x27;s longest-running passion play.

Union City is where Mallomars were first sold and the site of the first lunch wagon, built by Jerry and Daniel O&#x27;Mahoney and John Hanf, which helped spark New Jersey&#x27;s golden age of diner manufacturing, for which the state is colloquially referred to by author Richard J.S. Gutman as the &quot;diner capital of the world&quot;.

==History==
===Early history and civic boundaries===

The area of what is today Union City was originally inhabited by the Munsee-speaking branch of Lenape Native Americans, who wandered into the vast woodland area encountered by Henry Hudson during the voyages he conducted from 1609 to 1610 for the Dutch, who later claimed the area (which included the future New York City) and named it New Netherland. The portion of that land that included the future Hudson County was purchased from members of the Hackensack tribe of the Lenni-Lenape and became part of Pavonia, New Netherland.

The relationship between the early Dutch settlers and Native Americans was marked by frequent armed conflict over land claims. In 1658 by New Netherland colony Director-General Peter Stuyvesant re-purchased the territory. The boundaries of the purchase are described in the deed preserved in the New York State Archives, as well as the medium of exchange: &quot;80 fathoms of wampum, 20 fathoms of cloth, 12 brass kettles, 6 guns, one double brass kettle, 2 blankets, and one half barrel of strong beer.&quot; In 1660, he ordered the building of a fortified village at Bergen to protect the area. It was the first permanent European settlement in New Jersey, located in what is now the Journal Square area of Jersey City near Academy Street. In 1664, the British captured New Netherland from the Dutch, at which point the boundaries of Bergen Township encompassed what is now known as Hudson County. North of this was the unpopulated Bergen Woods, which would later be claimed by settlers, after whom a number of Union City streets today are named, including Sipp Street, Brown Street, Golden Lane, Tournade Street and Kerrigan Avenue, which is named after J. Kerrigan, the owner of Kerrigan Farm, who donated the land for Saint Michael&#x27;s Monastery.

The area that would one day be Union City, however, remained sparsely populated until the early 19th century. The British granted Bergen a new town charter in 1668. In 1682 they created Bergen County, which was named to honor their Dutch predecessors. That county included all of present-day Hudson, Bergen and Passaic counties. Sparsely inhabited during the 17th and 18th centuries, the southeast section of Bergen County had grown by the early 19th century to the point where it was deemed necessary to designate it a separate county. The New Jersey legislature created Hudson County in 1840, and in 1843, it was divided into two townships: Old Bergen Township (which eventually became Jersey City) and North Bergen Township, which was gradually separated into Hudson County&#x27;s present day municipalities: Hoboken in 1849, Weehawken and Guttenberg in 1859, and West Hoboken and Union Township. West Hoboken was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 28, 1861, from portions of North Bergen Township. The township was reincorporated on April 6, 1871, and again on March 27, 1874. Portions of the township were ceded to Weehawken in 1879. On June 28, 1884, West Hoboken was reincorporated as a town, based on an ordinance passed nine days earlier. The town was reincorporated on April 24, 1888, based on the results of a referendum passed 12 days earlier. Union Township, or simply Union, was formed in 1864 through the merger of a number of villages, such as Dalleytown, Buck&#x27;s Corners and Cox&#x27;s Corners. The largest of these villages, Union Hill, became the colloquial name for the merged town of Union itself. The northern section of Union Township was later incorporated as West New York in 1898. Union City was incorporated on June 1, 1925, by merging the two towns of West Hoboken and Union Hill. The name of one of the city&#x27;s schools, Union Hill Middle School, recalls the former town.

===Immigration and industry===

In the 18th century, Dutch and English merchants first settled the area. Later, German immigrants immigrated from Manhattan. Irish, Polish, Armenians, Syrians, Eastern European Jews and Italians followed. In 1851, Germans moved across the Hudson River from New York City in search of affordable land and open space. During the American Civil War a military installation, Camp Yates, covered an area now bounded by Bergenline and Palisade Avenues from 22nd to 32nd Street. Germans began to settle what would become Union Hill in 1851, and some descendants of the immigrants of this period live in the city today. Although the area&#x27;s diversity was represented by the more than 19 nationalities that made their home in the Dardanelles (a five-block area of Central Avenue from 23rd Street to 27th Street) from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, German Americans and Dutch dominated the area. Along with Swiss and Austrian immigrants, they founded the European-style lace making industries for which they were famous. The introduction of Schiffli lace machines in Hudson County made Union City the &quot;embroidery capital of the United States&quot;. The trademark of that industry is on the Union City Seal, though foreign competition and austere prevailing fashions led to the decline of embroidery and other industries in the area by the late 1990s. In May 2014 the city dedicated &quot;Embroidery Square&quot; at New York Avenue to commemorate that history.

As immigration to the area progressed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Belgians, Armenians, Greeks, Chinese, Jews and Russians found a home in the area, though its domination by Germans by the turn of the 20th century was reflected in the fact that the minutes of town meetings were recorded in German. By this time, the area was witnessing a period of urbanization, as an extensive trolley system was developed by the North Hudson County Railway, spurred by both electrification in 1890 and the arrival of Irish and Italian immigrants, which dominated the city until the late 1960s. Successive waves of immigrants from Eastern Europe, the Near East and Latin America contributed to the embroidery industry in subsequent years. &quot;The Cultural Thread&quot;/&quot;El Hilo&quot;, an exhibit highlighting this industry, is on display at Union City&#x27;s Park Performing Arts Center.

The town was famous for being the home of the rowdy Hudson Burlesque. Theaters in Union City featured vaudeville and burlesque and acts including Fred Astaire and Harry Houdini. It was at a vaudeville theater in Union City that comedian George Burns would meet his longtime partner and wife, Gracie Allen. Union City was also for a time the home to the headquarters of sports publisher Joe Weider. Weider&#x27;s empire included a Weider Barbell store in Union City, whose patrons included body builder Dave Draper.

The first Cubans immigrated to Union City from New York City in the late 1940s, having been attracted to the city in search of work after hearing of its famed embroidery factories. A majority of these Cubans hailed from small towns or cities, particularly Villa Clara Province in central Cuba. After World War II, veterans relocated to Bergen County, causing a short-lived decline in the population. By the 1960s the city was predominantly an old-line Italian enclave. This began to change when large numbers of Cubans emigrated to the city after Fidel Castro took power in 1962. This made Union City for many years the city with the largest Cuban population in the U.S. after Miami, hence its nickname, &quot;Little Havana on the Hudson.&quot; Following the Mariel boatlift in 1980, 10,000 Cubans settled in New Jersey, leading to a second wave of Cubans to Union City, which totaled 15,000 by 1994. The city, as well as neighboring towns such as West New York, experienced a profound cultural impact as a result of this, as seen in such aspects of local culture as its cuisine, fashion, music, entertainment and cigar-making.

Amid a redevelopment boom in the early 1960s, The Troy Towers, a 22-story twin tower luxury apartment complex, was completed in 1966 on the edge of the Palisades cliffs on Mountain Road at 19th Street, at the former site of the Abbey Inn, just north of where a motorized vehicle elevator and a staircase called the Lossburg Steps were located. The former was an angled ramp originally built for horse-drawn carriages, which along with the steps, connected to Hackensack Plank Road beneath the cliffs, in the Shades section of Weehawken. According to the Hudson County Multiple Listing service, between 2016 and 2018 the median list price of residential properties on the market in Union City fluctuated between $345,000 and $509,000. The most expensive home on the market in May 2018 was a four-family building on sale for $1.6 million, while the lowest was a studio apartment in Troy Towers for $148,000. A typical residential property was a six-bedroom, three-family house in need of updating, listed at $568,000.

===Development in the 21st century===

Since its inception in 2000, the Cuban Day Parade of New Jersey became a major annual event in North Hudson, beginning in North Bergen and traveling south to its end in Union City. Union City has historically been a family-oriented city predominantly made up of brownstones, two-family homes and locally owned businesses. Another wave of modestly sized residences began development approximately in 2003, spurred by similar development in neighboring Hoboken, and the city&#x27;s attempt to attract developers to what had historically been a town unfriendly to them, according to Mayor Brian P. Stack. Through approval of varied construction projects to address the needs of residents of different incomes, improved rent control laws and community input on such issues, this &quot;Hobokenization&quot; resulted in positive comparisons with the redeveloped Hoboken of the mid-to-late 1990s, with new restaurants, bars, and art galleries cited as evidence of renewal. The city recorded $192 million in new construction in 2007, and 600 certificates of occupancy, with 500–700 projected for 2008–2009, compared with previous years, in which 50 certificates was considered a high amount. This development continued for several years, reaching a milestone in 2008 with the completion of Union City&#x27;s first high-rise condominium tower, The Thread, whose name evokes the city&#x27;s historical association with the embroidery industry. Other such buildings followed, such as the Altessa, Park City Grand, and Hoboken Heights.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 1.29 square miles (3.33 km2), all of which was land. Part of the New York metropolitan area, it is one of the municipalities which comprise North Hudson. Located atop the ridge of the lower Hudson Palisades (just south of the highest point in the county), many of its streets offer glimpses and views of the surrounding municipalities, the New York City skyline, and the New Jersey Meadowlands.

The city is bisected by New Jersey Route 495, a vehicular cut built in conjunction with the Lincoln Tunnel. Soon after its construction, many street names were abandoned in favor of numbering in most of North Hudson starting at 2nd Street, just north of Paterson Plank Road, which runs through the city&#x27;s only major park and creates its border with Jersey City. 49th Street is the northern boundary with West New York. Apart from a small section between Bergen Turnpike and Weehawken Cemetery, Kennedy Boulevard, a major north–south thoroughfare, creates the western border with North Bergen. A former colonial road and previous border between the merged municipalities takes three names as it diagonally crosses the city&#x27;s urban grid: Hackensack Plank Road, 32nd Street, and Bergen Turnpike. Most of the city north of the street, formerly Union Hill, shares its eastern border along Park Avenue with Weehawken. The southern section of the city, formerly West Hoboken, is indeed west of Hoboken, which it overlooks and is connected by the road which creates their shared border, the Wing Viaduct.

The city borders the Hudson County municipalities of Hoboken, Jersey City, North Bergen, Weehawken and West New York. It is the only municipality in Hudson County to be entirely surrounded by other county municipalities.

==Demographics==
===20th century===
According to the 1910 United States census, the population of West Hoboken and Union Hill, the two towns that would later merge to form Union City was 37,000 and 23,000, respectively.

By the late 20th century, Union City emerged as a working class community. One of Hudson County&#x27;s three homeless shelters, Palisades Emergency Residence Corp. (PERC), is located in Union City. The PERC facility, which includes a soup kitchen, food pantry and 40-bed shelter on 37th Street, lost $100,000 in federal funding in 2011, and in January and August 2012, aided a record-breaking number of guests.

===2000 Census===
According to the 2000 United States Census, Union City had a population of 67,088, making it the second-most populous municipality in the county after Jersey City.

The population density was in 2000, approximately twice as high as New York City as a whole, but less than Manhattan alone. Union City is the most densely populated city in the United States, though neighboring Guttenberg (legally incorporated as a town) was more densely populated. In 2000, the median age was 32 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 98.8 males.

As of the 2000 Census, 58.7% of the population was foreign born and 21.6% of residents were naturalized citizens, while 13.9% only speak English at home, whereas 80.7% reported that they spoke Spanish at home.

===2010 census===
Union City&#x27;s 2010 population of 66,455 made it the state&#x27;s 17th largest municipality, having seen a decline of 633 residents (-0.9%) from its population of 67,088 in the 2000 census, when it was the state&#x27;s 16th most populous municipality. , it was still the country&#x27;s second-most densely populated incorporated municipality (after the nearby Town of Guttenberg) and the most densely populated U.S. city.

The 2010 United States census counted 66,455 people, 22,814 households, and 15,514 families in the city. The population density was 51,810.1 per square mile (20,004.0/km2). There were 24,931 housing units at an average density of 19,436.9 per square mile (7,504.6/km2). The racial makeup was 58.01% (38,549) White, 5.25% (3,487) Black or African American, 1.23% (819) Native American, 2.39% (1,587) Asian, 0.05% (33) Pacific Islander, 27.43% (18,231) from other races, and 5.64% (3,749) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 84.71% (56,291) of the population. , the city had the highest percentage of Hispanic residents in any municipality in New Jersey.

Of the 22,814 households, 34.2% had children under the age of 18; 36.7% were married couples living together; 21.8% had a female householder with no husband present and 32.0% were non-families. Of all households, 23.8% were made up of individuals and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.88 and the average family size was 3.39.

23.7% of the population were under the age of 18, 10.6% from 18 to 24, 32.4% from 25 to 44, 22.8% from 45 to 64, and 10.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.9 years. For every 100 females, the population had 100.4 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 98.3 males.

The Census Bureau&#x27;s 2006–2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $40,173 (with a margin of error of +/− $1,946) and the median family income was $43,101 (+/− $2,185). Males had a median income of $31,987 (+/− $1,696) versus $25,010 (+/− $1,517) for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,506 (+/− $719). About 17.0% of families and 20.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.4% of those under age 18 and 20.8% of those age 65 or over.

Hispanics remained the dominant ethnic group in the city, and their percentage of the population increased from 82.3% in the 2000 Census to 84.7% in the 2010 Census. Non-Hispanic whites made up 15.3% of the city&#x27;s population in 2010; up from 13.3% in the 2000 Census. Blacks made up 5.2% of the city&#x27;s population in 2010; up from 3.3% in the 2000 Census. The rest of the racial makeup of the city was 0.70% Native American, 2.15% Asian, 0.08% Pacific Islander, 28.19% from other races, and 6.87% from two or more races. Though Native Americans comprise less than 1% of the city&#x27;s population, they doubled between the 2000 and 2010 Census, and combined with West New York&#x27;s Native Americans, comprise 38% of the county&#x27;s Native American population. Spanish was spoken at home by more than half of the residents of Union City, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released in 2017.

===Demographics in the 2010s and 2020s===
As of May 2017, the age breakdown of the city was as follows: 22.5% of residents were under the age of 18, of which 6.6% were under the age of five; and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older. In 2019, the median age was 37.8 years.

By July 2019, 19.6% of residents lived in poverty.

===The Latino and Hispanic community===

Immigration from Cuba to Union City began slowly in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when jobs in the local embroidery and textile factories were abundant. By 1955, the city&#x27;s Cuban population was large enough that Fidel Castro visited Union City to raise money for his revolt against Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, though a speech he gave one night at a bar on 26th Street, Le Molino Rojo (&quot;The Red Mill&quot;) led to a brawl that resulted in Castro&#x27;s arrest.

Following the Cuban Revolution of 1959, large numbers of Cubans in professional occupations emigrated to Union City, resulting in Union City&#x27;s status as the nation&#x27;s second-largest Cuban population, behind Miami, Florida, leading to the nickname &quot;Little Havana on the Hudson&quot;. Aspects of the enclave are explored in the 2009 publication &quot;The Cubans of Union City: Immigrants and Exiles in a New Jersey Community&quot;.

In the ensuing decades, Cuban residents spread out to other communities of North Hudson County. West New York, at 19.64%, now has the highest percentage of Cubans in New Jersey, with Union City in second place, with 15.35%. These two municipalities have the highest Cuban population percentage in the United States outside of Florida. Moreover, Union City still boasts the largest Hispanic population percentage in New Jersey, at 84.7% by the 2010 Census.

By the early 2000s Union City had become a mix of the Latin and Asian diasporas, with Dominicans cited as the fastest-growing ethnic group, and other groups including Colombians, Ecuadoreans and Salvadorans. Despite the decline in the size of the Cuban population, the major New York City television news outlets will often journey to Union City to interview citizens when developments in Cuba–United States relations occur.

As of the 2000 Census, 5.94% of Union City&#x27;s residents identified themselves as being of Ecuadorian ancestry, which was the third highest of any municipality in New Jersey and the seventh highest percentage of Ecuadorian people in any place in the United States with 1,000 or more residents identifying their ancestry. That number increased to 12.6%, according to December 2017 Census figures.

==Parks and recreation==
Washington Park, which covers straddling the border of the city and The Heights neighborhood in Jersey City, is part of the Hudson County Park System. Previously a flat expanse of dirt, it had been used to host visiting carnivals, circuses, and Wild West shows, including Buffalo Bill&#x27;s &quot;Wild West&quot; show, performed there in 1908, when the plot was called the North Street Grounds. A movement to develop it into a park began in 1909, though this would not come into fruition until 1917, and the park took its current shape in the 1930s, partially as a result of the input of the Works Progress Administration. Among its features is &quot;Wave&quot;, a high, wide brushed stainless steel sculpture by Chakaia Booker that was installed in 2008.

Reservoir Park, located around Hackensack Reservoir on Palisade Avenue between 20th and 22nd Streets, opened on September 25, 2015. The passive park, at the city border in Weehawken, was created on the site of a reservoir that had been owned by United Water but had not been used since 1996.

==Commerce and economy==

Originally, Bergenline Avenue was the width of a cowpath, and was not regarded as a business center. Street car tracks were expected to be laid on Palisade Avenue where the Town Hall was located. However, an influential citizen named Henry Kohlmeier, who had just built his residence on Palisade Avenue, did not wish to be disturbed by the noise of the passing cars, and proposed that the tracks be laid on Bergenline Avenue, two blocks to the west, and before those who would have objected to this became aware of this change, the motion was approved.

The continuous line of retail stores that appeared on Bergenline Avenue by the time the town of Union Hill was incorporated made it not only the city&#x27;s main commercial thoroughfare, but a major shopping thoroughfare for North Hudson County, one of the leading shopping centers and commercial strips in Northern New Jersey, and the longest commercial avenue in the state. Among the Cuban Americans in the area, it has earned the nickname La Avenida.

Bergenline runs through not only the entire length of Union City from north to south, but also through West New York, Guttenberg and North Bergen. Also known as the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot;, Bergenline&#x27;s largest concentration of retail and chain stores begins at the intersection of 32nd Street and continues north until 92nd Street in North Bergen, and while it is a narrow one-way, southbound street throughout most of Union City, it becomes a four lane, two-way street at 48th Street, one block south of the town&#x27;s northern boundary. Bergenline Avenue is also used as the route for local parades, such as the annual Memorial Day Parade.
At Union City&#x27;s southern end, Bergenline is primarily a residential street, with the shopping district concentrated at Summit Avenue and Transfer Station, so called because it was a transfer point for buses and three trolley lines. A prominent landmark of Transfer Station is its five-corner intersection of Summit Avenue, Paterson Plank Road, and 7th Street, on which sits a five-story, trapezoid-shaped brick building at 707 Summit Avenue, originated in 1910 as the National Bank of North Hudson. It later became the First National Bank of Union City. By the 1960s, it had become the headquarters of Teamsters Local 560, which was controlled by mobster Anthony &quot;Tony Pro&quot; Provenzano, a reported caporegime in the Genovese crime family, and a top associate of Jimmy Hoffa. On July 30, 1975, Hoffa intended to meet Provenzano in Bloomfield Township, a suburb of Detroit, but Hoffa famously disappeared that afternoon. According to &quot;Time&quot;, Provenzano was seen fraternizing with local union members in Hoboken, although Provenzano, according to the Associated Press, told investigators that &quot;he was playing cards with Stephen Andretta in Union City, New Jersey the day Hoffa disappeared&quot;, and denied having arranged any meeting with Hoffa. In 2023, when the building went on sale, the city planned to purchase it for $3.1 million, and convert it into 24 affordable housing units.

Transfer Station was also the site, in 1912, of the first lunch wagon built by Jerry and Daniel O&#x27;Mahoney and John Hanf, which was bought for $800 and operated by restaurant entrepreneur Michael Griffin, who chose the location for its copious foot traffic. The wagon helped spark New Jersey&#x27;s so-called &quot;golden age of diner manufacturing&quot;, which in turn made the state the informal &quot;diner capital of the world&quot;. In the decades that followed, nearly all major U.S. diner manufacturers, including Jerry O&#x27;Mahoney Inc., started in New Jersey. During World War II, the area was a 24-hour hotspot for U.S. servicemen, who patronized the dozens of nightclubs located there. In later decades, Summit Avenue was not as busy a shopping area as upper Bergenline, so the city implemented a series of improvements in 2009 to improve business there, such as improved sidewalks, landscaping and street lights from Seventh Street to 13th Street.

In terms of business, Union City is notable for being the location where Mallomars were first sold. Nabisco sold them to a grocer in the southern half of the town, when it was West Hoboken.

Union City is one of several cities in Hudson County that contains a state-established Urban Enterprise Zone (UEZ), under a program that was implemented in 1983 by the New Jersey Department of Commerce and Economic Development assist businesses and revitalize economically distressed communities in New Jersey. One of 32 zones covering 37 municipalities statewide, Union City was selected in 1994 as one of a group of 10 zones added to participate in the program and one of four of those chosen based on a competition. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment and investment within the UEZ, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the % rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants. Established in April 1995, the city&#x27;s Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in April 2026. There are approximately 180 UEZ-certified businesses in the city, which includes Bergenline Avenue from 49th to 15th Streets, 32nd Street from Bergenline Avenue to Kennedy Boulevard, Summit Avenue from 18th to Fifth Street, and Paterson Plank Road from Fifth to Seventh Streets. In addition to providing an incentive for shoppers and for business owners to invest in the area without raising taxes, up to $30,000 in annual UEZ revenue is also used for area upkeep and safety projects, marketing campaigns, and holiday decorations.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Union City&#x27;s unemployment rate as of September 2009 was 15%, the highest in the state, compared with the lowest, Hoboken, at 6.3%, and a statewide rate of 9.8%. By 2018, the city&#x27;s unemployment rate was 4.5%, compared to a rate of 3.9% in Hudson County.

==Government==
===Local government===

Union City&#x27;s City Hall is located at 3715 Palisade Avenue. The oldest municipal building in North Hudson, it was built in the 1890s as the town hall for Union Hill. Prior to the 1914 opening of Union Hill High School, classes were also held in the building. After the 1925 consolidation of West Hoboken and Union Hill into Union City, the town hall for the former was converted into the new fire headquarters for the city. It also served as the second police precinct for many years.

==Education==

The student population was 9,730 as of November 2009. In 2021, its 14 public schools served 11,893 students.

Historically, Union City schools have ranked among the highest in Hudson County in reported incidents of violence compared to the size of the student population more than once, most recently in a November 2009 report by the New Jersey Department of Education, which annually records incidents of violence, vandalism, weapons and substance abuse or possession. According to the report, such incidents declined statewide between the 2006–2007 and the 2007–2008 school years, but rose slightly in Hudson County, with Union City schools having the second-highest number of reported incidents behind the Jersey City Public Schools.

University of California, Berkeley Professor David L. Kirp, in his 2011 book, &quot;Kids First&quot;, and his 2013 book, &quot;Improbable Scholars&quot;, praised Union City&#x27;s education system for bringing poor, mostly immigrant kids (three quarters of whom live in homes where only Spanish is spoken and a quarter of which are thought to be undocumented and fearful of deportation) into the educational mainstream. Kirp, who spent a year in Union City examining its schools, notes that while in the late 1970s, Union City schools faced the threat of state takeover, they now boast achievement scores that approximate the statewide average. Kirp also observes that in 2011, Union City boasted a high school graduation rate of 89.5 percent—roughly 10 percentage points higher than the national average, and that in 2012, 75 percent of Union City graduates enrolled in college, with top students winning scholarships to the Ivy League. Kirp singles out the city&#x27;s practice of enrolling almost every 3- and 4-year-old in kindergarten, and the leadership of Union City High School principal John Bennetti for the positive educational atmosphere in that school.

The NHHEC also houses offices for the Hudson County Career Development Center and the County Clerk.
Colin Powell Elementary School opened in September 2012 and was dedicated on February 7, 2013. It is the seventh educational facility created over the course of a decade, and the 14th school in the city. For the 2013–2014 school year students from Gilmore and Hudson Schools were relocated to Colin Powell, so that the former schools, both of which are over 100 years old, could undergo renovations. The K-5 school, which is located on New York Avenue and 15th Street, was visited by its namesake, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, in June 2013.

Woodrow Wilson School was awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive, during the 2004–2005 school year.

The city&#x27;s newest school is Union City Middle School, which began construction in September 2023. The 15th school in the city, the six-story, $93.7 million project, which is located at 518 36th Street between Kennedy Boulevard and Bergenline Avenue, was conceived to ease overcrowding in the city&#x27;s classrooms. It will house students that otherwise would have attended Emerson and Union Hill Middle Schools, as well as some ninth graders that would have otherwise attended Union City High School, and enable the city to move all sixth graders into its elementary schools. It is expected to open for the 2025 Fall semester. Although it will be able to host 936 students, the city will limit it to 827. Its specialized classrooms will include a robotics lab, a hydroponics lab, and a dance studio.

===Private schools===
St. Francis Academy is a K-8 Catholic school operated under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark. In September 2013, St. Francis Academy was one of 15 schools in New Jersey to be recognized by the United States Department of Education as part of the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program, an award called the &quot;most prestigious honor in the United States&#x27; education system&quot; and which Education Secretary Arne Duncan described as honoring schools that &quot;represent examples of educational excellence&quot;. In the wake of declining enrollment and lingering financial issues, Mother Seton Interparochial School (which had been formed in 2006 from the merger of St. Michael&#x27;s and St. Anthony of Padua) and St. Augustine&#x27;s School were closed by the Newark Archdiocese after the 2019–20, school year and merged into Academy of St. Joseph of the Palisades in West New York, New Jersey.

==Notable landmarks==
The former Monastery and Church of Saint Michael the Archangel on West Street, once the largest Roman Catholic church in Hudson County, is the one landmark on the National Register of Historic Places in Union City, and one of several locations which have been designated by New Jersey Register of Historic Places. It is now known as the Hudson Presbyterian Church. In 2002 José Martí Middle School and the southern branch of the Union City Public Library were built on the southern side of the Monastery grounds, on 18th Street. They opened in 2004. When Union City High School opened in September 2009, the middle school converted to José Martí Freshman Academy to house most of town&#x27;s ninth graders. In 2019 that building was repurposed as José Martí STEM Academy, in order to expand access to instruction in Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

The Park Performing Arts Center was originally built in 1931 by the German congregation the Catholic parish of Holy Family Church (and still owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark) to house their cultural and educational programs Its outstanding feature is the Park Theater which seats 1,400. Incorporated in 1983 the non-profit arts center presents works of local, national, and international artists, as well as permanent and rotating exhibitions.

Union City High School and Athletic Complex opened in September 2009 on the site of the former Roosevelt Stadium, demolished in 2005 to make way for it. The sports field is located on the second floor roof of the building, which also houses the Union City Performing Arts Center and a community health center.

Emerson Middle School, was opened in April 1915 as West Hoboken High School, and was home to the Bulldogs. It was renamed Emerson High School for the writer Ralph Waldo Emerson, when the two towns merged. Located on New York Avenue at 18th Street, the original building is connected with the gym building, built in the 1980s, by a second story enclosed bridge that runs over New York Avenue. The school became the South campus of Union City High School in September 2008, before converting to a middle school in September 2009, with the opening of the new Union City High School proper. The mascot of Union City was also changed to the Soaring Eagles. Alumni of the school include DJ and music producer Erick Morillo and former Green Bay Packers center Frank Winters.

Union City is home to two Carnegie Libraries funded by the donations of steel magnate Andrew Carnegie. Both are considered historically and architecturally significant by the city. The first was built in 1903 by the Cranwell family builders, who were active in the construction of many of the city&#x27;s buildings, with a $25,000 donation by Carnegie in what was once West Hoboken on 15th Street between Bergenline Avenue and New York Avenue. The second was built in 1905 at the corner of 43rd Street and New York Avenue in what was once Union Hill, and is the main branch. The 15th Street library retains its original stained glass, but was closed in 2004 upon the completion of a new library on the corner of Summit Avenue and 18th Street, housed in the same building as José Martí Middle School. It was converted into the William V. Musto Cultural Center, which opened in June 2011. It houses the Union City Museum of Art, the Union City Police Museum, the Union City Art Gallery &amp; Concert Hall, the Union City Museum of History, and a senior citizen center.
Celia Cruz Park On June 4, 2004, nearly a year after the death of Cuban-American salsa singer Celia Cruz (who lived in nearby Fort Lee), Union City heralded its annual Cuban Day Parade by dedicating a park to Cruz, which is also known as Celia Cruz Plaza, at 31st Street and Bergenline Avenue, with Cruz&#x27;s widower, Pedro Knight, present. The park featured a sidewalk star in Cruz&#x27;s honor, and an 8&#x27; × 10&#x27; mural by Union City&#x27;s Edgardo Davila, a collage of Cruz&#x27;s career throughout the decades. There are four other similar dedications to Cruz around the world. The Latin American Kiwanis Club refurbished the park in early June 2006, replacing the mural with a backlit photograph of Cruz. Cruz&#x27;s star has expanded into Union City&#x27;s &quot;Walk of Fame&quot;, as new marble stars are added each spring to honor Latin entertainment and media personalities. People so honored at the park include merengue singer Joseíto Mateo, salsa singer La India, Cuban musician Israel &quot;Cachao&quot; Lopez, Cuban tenor Beny Moré, Tito Puente, Spanish language television news anchor Rafael Pineda, salsa pioneer Johnny Pacheco, singer/bandleader Gilberto Santa Rosa and music promoter Ralph Mercado.
9/11 Memorials The city&#x27;s first memorial to honor the five Union City citizens who died in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was a sculpture placed in Doric Park, in whose courtyard citizens gathered on September 11, 2001 to view the attacks&#x27; aftermath. On September 11, 2007, the city dedicated its Liberty Plaza to commemorate the event. The Plaza, which serves as a transit hub through which commuters pass on their way to and from Manhattan, includes two memorial markers. Doric Park was later rebuilt as Firefighters Memorial Park, which opened in August 2009. The park includes a public swimming pool, and a new memorial to local fallen firefighters that stands at the entrance. Its popularity has attracted visitors from Manhattan and Staten Island.

The Monastery of the Perpetual Rosary, known as The Blue Chapel, was constructed between 1912 and 1914. In 2010, the chapel was included on Preservation New Jersey&#x27;s annual 10 Most Endangered Historic Sites list, which is intended to draw attention to historical sites in need of preservation. The site&#x27;s caretakers have previously indicated that it will likely be abandoned or sold, but the city Board of Commissioners passed a November 3, 2010 resolution designating it as a historic site as part of efforts to protect it.
Historical markers In 2009, Union City began installing a series of historical markers to commemorate the lives of its noteworthy natives. The first marker was dedicated to the memory of boxer Joe Jeanette on April 17, 2009, and placed at the corner of Summit Avenue and 27th Street on April 17, 2009, where Jeanette&#x27;s former residence and gym once stood. The marker lies two blocks from a street, located between Summit Avenue and Kennedy Boulevard, that was named Jeanette Street in his honor. Present at the dedication ceremony was Jeanette&#x27;s grandniece, Sabrina Jennette. Another historical marker was dedicated September 26, 2009 to Peter George Urban, a 10th degree karate grandmaster, writer and teacher who founded an American karate system, American Goju Do. Present at the dedication ceremony was Urban&#x27;s daughter, Julia Urban-Kimmerly. On May 22, 2010 the city dedicated a marker to novelist and screenwriter Pietro di Donato, and placed at Bergenline Avenue and 31st Street, where di Donato once lived. That area was named Pietro di Donato Plaza in his honor. Present at the dedication ceremony was di Donato&#x27;s son, Richard. The fourth marker was dedicated to painter William Tylee Ranney on September 18, 2010. In addition to those honoring people, subsequent markers were erected to honor particular sites. As of December 2012, the city had eight historic markers.

COVID-19 Victims Memorial On March 25, 2022, the city dedicated a memorial in Ellsworth Park, in tribute to the citizens who died and suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A plaque on the forward side of the pedestal reads, &quot;In memory of all those who perished from the COVID-19 Pandemic. You will always be in our hearts.&quot;

==Media and culture==
Union City is located within the New York media market, with most of its daily papers available for sale or delivery. Until its closing in 1991, the &quot;Hudson Dispatch&quot;, a morning daily newspaper that once had a circulation of 39,132, was based in Union City for 117 years. It later relaunched as a free bilingual weekly. Local, county, and regional news is covered by the daily &quot;Jersey Journal&quot;. &quot;The Union City Reporter&quot; was part of the &quot;Hudson Reporter&quot; group of local weeklies until that chain closed in January 2023. Other publications that cover local news include the &quot;River View Observer&quot; and &quot;El Especialito&quot;, which is as of 2016, is headquartered in Union City.
Among the films set or shot in the city are &quot;Union City&quot; (1980) (which was released in conjunction with the Blondie song &quot;Union City Blue&quot;), &quot;Out of the Darkness&quot; (1985), and &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002). The low-budget film directed by former Guttenberg mayor Peter Lavilla, &quot;Oak Hill&quot;, features local institutions including Union City&#x27;s Palisades Emergency Residence Corporation homeless shelter and a synagogue in North Bergen.

The mixed-use, two-story building at 2312 Summit Avenue, at the corner of 24th street, which features two ballrooms, has hosted performers including Frank Sinatra, Tito Nieves, La Sonora, Bacilos, Guayacan, and Nelson N. The 1989 film &quot;Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot;, which starred Madonna, Matt Dillon, and Jennifer Grey, was also partially filmed at the building. Specifically, one of the two ballrooms in the building was used as a major setting for much of the film, which is set on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1928. During shooting at that location, the property was rented for six months, and Madonna lived in an apartment in the building. It was put up for sale in October 2023 for $2.5 million. Not far away, Madonna also recorded her self-titled debut album at the former Quantum Sound Studios near Washington Park at 512 Paterson Plank Road, across the street from the Union City side of that road.

In the late 2000s, Union City, West New York, Weehawken and North Bergen came to be dubbed collectively as &quot;NoHu&quot;, a North Hudson haven for local performing and fine artists, many of whom are immigrants from Latin America and other countries, in part due to lower housing costs compared to those in nearby art havens such as Hoboken, Jersey City and Manhattan. The Union City area is a major training ground for actors in the county. In September 2008, Union City held its first annual month-long Art Month, which originated with the September 2006 &quot;Celebrate Art&quot; show at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. Art Month includes events such as the Union City Arts and Crafts Festival, held the second week of every September. Group shows are also arranged by organizations such as La Ola, a group formed to help unite local artists, and Federación Mercantil, which provides support to artists in the form of bank loan assistance and help avoiding foreclosure, and puts on an annual show of work by Spanish-American painters. Another is the Union City Artists Collective, founded in 2007 by a group of artists and public officials that includes painter/sculptor Amado Mora, who was named Union City&#x27;s first Art Curator, responsible for the Union City Art Gallery at City Hall. Locations in which artists reside or have put on tours or shows include the Yardley Building, a former Yardley of London soap factory on Palisade Avenue that overlooks Hoboken, and the old R.H. Simon Silk Mill on 39th Street, which has been dubbed the &quot;Union Hill Arts Building&quot;. The Park Performing Arts Center is also a popular arts venue in the city, as it houses Hudson Theatre Works, a theatre company founded in 2011. It was also the first venue for the Park Players, an acting troupe founded in the early 1980s by local teacher Joseph Conklin, and formerly hosted the &quot;NoHu Visions&quot; show, and the annual two-day Multi-Arts Festival until 2010, when the latter moved to Union City High School, which houses the Union City Performing Arts Center.
In 2009 poet/musician Graciela Barreto was named Union City&#x27;s first poet laureate. By April 2010 she was succeeded by Ben Figueroa. During the late 2000s the city also named a City Historian and organized a Historical Committee.

The 2010 independent gothic horror art film, &quot;Vampire in Union City&quot;, was filmed entirely in Union City, and was directed by entertainer and Union City Commissioner Lucio Fernandez. Produced by MeLu Films, it premiered on September 3, 2010 at the Summit Theater, marking the city&#x27;s first movie premiere, and the 2010 Celebrate Art Month, which included art exhibits, jazz, dance and opera performances, a film festival, and the public release of Francisco Rivadeneira&#x27;s book, &quot;Los Amos del Planeta, Tomo II&quot;.

On April 20, 2018, Union City&#x27;s Performing Arts Center hosted the official premiere of &quot;Union City, U.S.A.&quot;, a documentary on the city&#x27;s history and culture. It was written, directed, and produced by Fernandez, who began research for the film in 2008 with city historian Gerard Karabin, conducting interviews with numerous past and current residents of the city. The film was edited by director of photography Mauro De Trizio, and narrated by Tom Colavito.

The Multi-Arts Festival is an exhibition of artwork, musical performances and workshops held every May since 1981. Students and alumni of the various schools of Union City display their artwork, put on musical performances, and put on free demonstrations of sculpture, portraiture and caricature for attendees. It was created by Agnes Dauerman, a Union Hill High School art teacher, who coordinated the program for 25 years before she retired in 2005. The Union City Museum of Art, the Union City Police Museum, the Union City Art Gallery and Concert Hall and the Union City Museum of History are housed in the William V. Musto Cultural Center, formerly the 15th Street library. The Musto Center hosts a number of events, including various concerts and theatrical performances. Specific events it has hosted include the Union City Artist Awards, the NoHu International Film Festival, and Artists Assemble!, a comics convention first held in February 2013.

The first annual Union City International Film Festival began in December 2010, with the short film &quot;X&quot;, which was written and directed by Josh Brolin, as the opening film. Later that month Union City unveiled the Union City Plaza of the Arts on Bergenline Avenue between 30th and 31st Streets, as a venue for artists to congregate and showcase their work. The location, which sees copious traffic to and from Midtown Manhattan, was chosen in order to showcase the city in a positive light to commuters, and so that the plaza could represent fine arts alongside the adjacent Pietro Di Donato Plaza and Celia Cruz Plaza, which represent literature and music, respectively.

On June 11, 2014, the city&#x27;s Board of Commissioners passed a resolution adopting &quot;Union City&quot; as the city&#x27;s official song. The song was composed by Union City native Phil Gallo and Weehawken native Mike Boldt, and performed by the group Dez Manku, which features Boldt and Gallo. An accompanying music video was produced and edited by Mauro DeTrizio for Action Productions, and released on YouTube and iTunes. The guitar-driven rock song&#x27;s lyrics make references to local streets such as Bergenline Avenue and Monastery Place, and landmarks such as the Roosevelt Theater, the Hudson Burlesque, and the former high schools, Emerson and Union Hill.

<doc id="125244" wikidata="Q176410" url="?curid=125244" title="Weehawken, New Jersey">
<text>Weehawken is a township in the northern part of Hudson County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located on the Hudson Waterfront and Hudson Palisades overlooking the Hudson River. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 17,197, an increase of 4,643 (+37.0%) from the 2010 census count of 12,554, which in turn reflected a decline of 947 (−7.0%) from the 13,501 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
===Name===
The name &quot;Weehawken&quot; is generally considered to have evolved from the Algonquian language Lenape spoken by the Hackensack and Tappan. It has variously been interpreted as &quot;maize land&quot;, &quot;place of gulls&quot;, &quot;rocks that look like trees&quot;, which would refer to the Palisades, atop which most of the town sits, or &quot;at the end&quot;, among other suggested translations.

Three U.S. Navy ships have been named for the city. The USS &quot;Weehawken&quot;, launched on November 5, 1862, was a &quot;Passaic&quot;-class monitor, or ironclad ship, which sailed for the Union Navy during the American Civil War, encountered battles at the Charleston, South Carolina, coast and sank in a moderate gale on December 6, 1863. The &quot;Weehawken&quot; was the last ferry to the West Shore Terminal on March 25, 1959, at 1:10 am, ending 259 years of continuous ferry service. Weehawken Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Greenwich Village was the site of a colonial Hudson River ferry landing.

The name and the place have inspired mention in multiple works of popular culture.

===Founding===

The township&#x27;s written history began in 1609, when Henry Hudson, on his third voyage to the New World, sailed down what was later named the North River on the Half Moon and anchored in Weehawken Cove. At the time it was the territory of the Hackensack and Tappan, of the Turtle Clan, or Unami, a branch of the Lenape. They were displaced by immigrants to the province of New Netherland, who had begun to settle the west bank of the Hudson at Pavonia in 1630. On May 11, 1647, Maryn Adriansen received a patent for a plantation (of 169 acres) at &quot;Awiehaken&quot;. In 1658, Director-General of New Netherland Peter Stuyvesant negotiated a deal with the Lenape to purchase all the land from &quot;the great rock above Wiehacken&quot;, west to &quot;Sikakes&quot; (Secaucus) and south to &quot;Konstapels Hoeck&quot; (Constable Hook). In 1661, Weehawken became part of Bergen when it (and most of northeastern New Jersey) came under the jurisdiction of the court at Bergen Square.

In 1674, New Netherland was ceded to the Netherlands by the British and the town became part of the Province of East Jersey. In 1677, John Luby acquired several parcels covering along the Hudson. Most habitation was along the top of the cliffs since the low-lying areas were mostly marshland. Descriptions from the period speak of the dense foliage and forests and excellent land for growing vegetables and orchard fruits. As early as 1700 there was regular, if sporadic ferry service from Weehawken. In 1752, King George II made the first official grant for ferry service, the ferry house north of Hoboken primarily used for farm produce and likely was sold at the Greenwich Village landing that became Weehawken Street.

Weehawken was formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature, on March 15, 1859, from portions of Hoboken and North Bergen. A portion of the township was ceded to Hoboken in 1874. Additional territory was annexed in 1879 from West Hoboken.

===Revolutionary War===

During the American Revolutionary War, Weehawken was used as a lookout for the patriots to check on the British, who were situated in New York and controlled the surrounding waterways. In fact, in July 1778, Lord Stirling asked Aaron Burr, in a letter written on behalf of General George Washington, to employ several persons to &quot;go to Bergen Heights, Weehawk, Hoebuck, or any other heights thereabout to observe the motions of the enemy&#x27;s shipping&quot; and to gather any other possible intelligence. Early documented inhabitants included a Captain James Deas, whose stately residence at Deas&#x27; Point was located atop a knoll along the river. Lafayette had used the mansion as his headquarters and later Washington Irving came to gaze at Manhattan.

Not far from Deas&#x27; was a ledge 11 paces wide and 20 paces long, situated above the Hudson on the Palisades. This ledge, long gone, was the site of 18 documented duels and probably many unrecorded ones in the years 1798–1845. The most famous is the duel between Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury, and Aaron Burr, then Vice President of the United States, which took place on July 11, 1804; this duel was re-enacted on its 200th anniversary (July 11, 2004) by descendants of Hamilton and Burr. Three years earlier, a duel was held at this spot between Hamilton&#x27;s son, Philip Hamilton, and George Eacker. (Another source, however, puts the duel in Paulus Hook in Jersey City.) Phillip, who had been defending his father&#x27;s honor, suffered a fatal wound in his hip and his left arm and died two days later on November 24, 1801.

===19th century===
In the mid-19th century, James G. King built his estate Highwood on the bluff that now bears his name and entertained many political and artistic figures of the era, including Daniel Webster.

With the ferry, the Hackensack Plank Road (a toll road that was a main artery from Weehawken to Hackensack), and later, the West Shore Railroad, built during the early 1870s, the waterfront became a transportation hub. The wealthy built homes along the top of the New Jersey Palisades, where they might flee from the sweltering heat of New York and breathe the fresh air of the heights. Weehawken became the playground of the rich during the middle to late 19th century. A series of wagon lifts, stairs and even a passenger elevator designed by the same engineer as those at the Eiffel Tower (which at the time was the world&#x27;s largest) were put in place to accommodate the tourists and summer dwellers. The Eldorado Amusement Park, a pleasure garden which opened in 1891, drew massive crowds.

===20th century===
The turn of the 20th century saw the end of the large estates, casinos, hotels, and theaters as tourism gave way to subdivisions (such as Highwood Park and Clifton Park) and the construction of many of the private homes in the township. This coincided with the influx of the Germans, Austrians, and Swiss, who built them and the breweries and embroidery factories in nearby Union City and West New York. While remaining essentially residential, Weehawken continued to grow as Hudson County became more industrial and more populated. Shortly after World War I, a significant contingent of Syrian immigrants from Homs (a major textile center in its own right) moved into Weehawken to take advantage of the burgeoning textile industry.

==Geography==
Weehawken is part of the New York metropolitan area. Situated on the western shore of the Hudson River, along the southern end of the New Jersey Palisades across from Midtown Manhattan, it is the western terminus of the Lincoln Tunnel. Weehawken is one of the towns that comprise North Hudson, sometimes called NoHu in the artistic community.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 1.48 square miles (3.82 km2), including 0.78 square miles (2.03 km2) of land and 0.69 square miles (1.79 km2) of water (46.69%).

The township borders the municipalities of Hoboken, Union City and West New York in Hudson County; and the New York City borough of Manhattan, across the Hudson River.

While the Palisades defines Weehawken&#x27;s natural topography, the Lincoln Tunnel Helix is prominent man-made and Lincoln Tunnel toll plaza are prominent man-made structures. Geographically, Weehawken has distinct neighborhoods: Downtown (known as &quot;The Shades&quot;), the Heights, Uptown (which includes Kingswood Bluff, known as &quot;The Bluff&quot;), and the Waterfront, which since the 1990s has been developed for transportation, commercial, recreational and residential uses. Though some are long abandoned (e.g., Grauert Causeway), there are still several outdoor public staircases (e.g., Shippen Steps) throughout the town and more than 15 &quot;dead-end&quot; streets. At its southeastern corner is Weehawken Cove which, along with the rail tracks farther inland, defines Weehawken&#x27;s border with Hoboken. Its northern boundary is shared with West New York. Traversing Weehawken is Boulevard East, a scenic thoroughfare offering a sweeping vista of the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline. Local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in the township. In a 1999 decision that blocked the development of a pair of waterfront towers that would have stood , a judge cited the panoramic vistas from Weehawken as &quot;a world-class amenity that encourages people to live, work and locate businesses in the area&quot;. In 2021, the development company Roseland donated of land on the Palisades cliff face to the town in order to preserve its beauty and its history.

===Hamilton Monument===

The Alexander Hamilton Monument on Hamilton Avenue, next to Hamilton Park, is the site of the second memorial to the Burr–Hamilton duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. The first, on the original duel site, was constructed in 1806 by the Saint Andrew Society, of which Hamilton had been a member. A 14-foot (4.3-m) marble cenotaph, consisting of an obelisk, topped by a flaming urn and a plaque with a quote from Horace, surrounded by an iron fence, was raised about where Hamilton was believed to have fallen. Duels continued to be fought at the site and the marble was slowly vandalized and removed for souvenirs, disappearing entirely by 1820. The tablet turned up in a junk store and found its way to the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan, where it still resides.

From 1820 to 1857, the site was marked by two stones, with the names Hamilton and Burr, placed where they were thought to have stood during the duel. When a road from Hoboken to Fort Lee was built through the site in 1858, an inscription on a boulder where a mortally wounded Hamilton was thought to have rested—one of the many pieces of graffiti left by visitors—was all that remained. No primary accounts of the duel confirm the boulder anecdote. In 1870, railroad tracks were built directly through the site and the boulder was hauled to the top of the Palisades, where it remains today, located just off the Boulevard East. In 1894, an iron fence was built around the boulder, supplemented by a bust of Hamilton and a plaque. The bust was thrown over the cliff on October 14, 1934, by vandals and the head was never recovered; a new bust was unveiled on July 12, 1935.

The plaque was stolen by vandals in the 1980s and an abbreviated version of the text was inscribed on the indentation left in the boulder, which remained until the early 1990s, when a granite pedestal was added in front of the boulder; the bust was moved to the top of the pedestal. New historical markers were added on July 11, 2004, the 200th anniversary of the duel.

The 181 and 188 routes offer service to the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal. Travel to other New Jersey communities, including Jersey City, is offered on the 22, 23, 84, 86, 88 and 89.

The Bergenline Avenue station of Hudson-Bergen Light Rail is located at the city line with Union City, while the Weehawken Port Imperial station is located on the Weehawken waterfront at the foot of Pershing Road near the NY Waterway ferry terminal. Regular ferry crossings of the Hudson River run daily.

Jitney commuter buses operate along Bergenline Avenue, providing service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, the Newport Centre and other local destinations. The county&#x27;s most frequent route for dollar buses, jitneys operate along Bergenline Avenue as frequently as one bus every minute.

The closest airport in New Jersey with scheduled passenger service is Newark Liberty International Airport, located away in Newark and Elizabeth. New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport is away in Queens via the Lincoln Tunnel.

==Media and culture==
West New York is located within the New York media market, with most of its daily papers available for sale or delivery. &quot;The Jersey Journal&quot; is a local daily paper based in Jersey City. Local weeklies include the free bilingual paper, &quot;Hudson Dispatch Weekly&quot;, a former daily, &quot;The West New York Reporter&quot;, which is part of the Hudson Reporter group of local weeklies, and the Spanish language &quot;El Especialito&quot;. &quot;River View Observer&quot; is a monthly newspaper that covers the Hudson County waterfront market.

In the late 2000s, West New York, Weehawken, Union City and North Bergen came to be dubbed collectively as &quot;NoHu&quot;, a North Hudson haven for local performing and fine artists, many of whom are immigrants from Latin America and other countries, in part due to lower housing costs compared to those in nearby art havens such as Hoboken, Jersey City and Manhattan.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===
Alexandria Township is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The governing body is comprised of a five-member Township Committee, whose members are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with one seat coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as mayor and another as deputy mayor.

In the November 2020 general election, voters approved a ballot question that asked if they wanted to expand the township committee from three members to five. In November 2021, voters chose two candidates to serve three-year terms and one to serve a two-year term, so that there were five members elected to the Township Committee starting in January 2022.

, members of the Alexandria Township Committee are Mayor James Kiernan (R, term as mayor ends December 31, 2026; term as mayor ends 2024), Deputy Mayor Jay M. Arancio (R, term on committee and as deputy mayor ends 2024), Tom Hudanish (R, 2025), Robert Mortara (R, 2026) and Rudolph C. &quot;Chris&quot; Pfefferle (R, 2024).

In September 2015, the Township Committee selected Michelle Garay from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by Harry Swift until his death in office earlier that month.

Christian Pfefferle took office in November 2014 after running unopposed to fill the 14 months remaining in the term of the seat that had been vacated by Gabe Plummer when he resigned after he had moved outside of the township in January 2014; Curtis Schick had filled the seat on an interim basis.

<doc id="125248" wikidata="Q43274" url="?curid=125248" title="Charles III">
<text>Charles III (Charles Philip Arthur George; born 14 November 1948) is King of the United Kingdom and the 14 other Commonwealth realms since 2022.

Charles was born in Buckingham Palace during the reign of his maternal grandfather, King George VI, and became heir apparent when his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, acceded to the throne in 1952. He was created Prince of Wales in 1958 and his investiture was held in 1969. He was educated at Cheam School and Gordonstoun, and later spent six months at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia. After completing a history degree from the University of Cambridge, Charles served in the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy from 1971 to 1976. In 1981, he married Lady Diana Spencer. They had two sons, William and Harry. Charles and Diana divorced in 1996, after they had each engaged in well-publicised extramarital affairs. Diana died as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash the following year. In 2005, Charles married his long-term partner, Camilla Parker Bowles.

As heir apparent, Charles undertook official duties and engagements on behalf of his mother and represented the United Kingdom on visits abroad. He founded The Prince&#x27;s Trust in 1976, sponsored the Prince&#x27;s Charities, and became patron or president of more than 800 other charities and organisations. He advocated for the conservation of historic buildings and the importance of traditional architecture in society. In that vein, he generated the experimental new town of Poundbury. An environmentalist, Charles supported organic farming and action to prevent climate change during his time as the manager of the Duchy of Cornwall estates, earning him awards and recognition as well as criticism; he is also a prominent critic of the adoption of genetically modified food, while his support for alternative medicine has been criticised. He has authored or co-authored 17 books.

Charles became king upon his mother&#x27;s death in 2022. At the age of 73, he was the oldest person to accede to the British throne, after having been the longest-serving heir apparent and Prince of Wales in British history. Significant events in his reign have included his coronation in 2023 and his cancer diagnosis the following year, the latter of which temporarily suspended planned public engagements.

== Early life, family, and education ==

Charles was born at 21:14 (GMT) on 14 November 1948, during the reign of his maternal grandfather, King George VI, as the first child of Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh (later Queen Elizabeth II), and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He was delivered by Caesarean section at Buckingham Palace. His parents had three more children, Anne (born 1950), Andrew (born 1960) and Edward (born 1964). He was christened &quot;Charles Philip Arthur George&quot; on 15 December 1948 in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace by the archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher.

George VI died on 6 February 1952 and Charles&#x27;s mother acceded to the throne as Elizabeth II; Charles immediately became the heir apparent. Under a charter of Edward III in 1337, and as the monarch&#x27;s eldest son, he automatically assumed the traditional titles of Duke of Cornwall and, in the Scottish peerage, the titles Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. The following year, Charles attended his mother&#x27;s coronation at Westminster Abbey.

When Charles turned five, Catherine Peebles was appointed as governess to oversee his education at Buckingham Palace. He then commenced classes at Hill House School in west London in November 1956. Charles was the first heir apparent to attend school, rather than be educated by a private tutor. He did not receive preferential treatment from the school&#x27;s founder and headmaster, Stuart Townend, who advised the Queen to have Charles train in football, because the boys were never deferential to anyone on the football field. Charles subsequently attended two of his father&#x27;s former schools: Cheam School in Hampshire, from 1958, followed by Gordonstoun, in the north-east of Scotland, beginning classes there in April 1962. He later became patron of Gordonstoun in May 2024.

In his 1994 authorised biography by Jonathan Dimbleby, Charles&#x27;s parents were described as physically and emotionally distant and Philip was blamed for his disregard of Charles&#x27;s sensitive nature, including forcing him to attend Gordonstoun, where he was bullied. Though Charles reportedly described Gordonstoun, noted for its especially rigorous curriculum, as &quot;Colditz in kilts&quot;, he later praised the school, stating it had taught him &quot;a great deal about myself and my own abilities and disabilities&quot;. He said in a 1975 interview he was &quot;glad&quot; he had attended Gordonstoun and that the &quot;toughness of the place&quot; was &quot;much exaggerated&quot;. In 1966, Charles spent two terms at the Timbertop campus of Geelong Grammar School in Victoria, Australia, during which time he visited Papua New Guinea on a school trip with his history tutor, Michael Collins Persse. In 1973, Charles described his time at Timbertop as the most enjoyable part of his whole education. Upon his return to Gordonstoun, he emulated his father in becoming head boy, and left in 1967 with six GCE O-levels and two A-levels in history and French, at grades B and C respectively. On his education, Charles later remarked, &quot;I didn&#x27;t enjoy school as much as I might have; but, that was only because I&#x27;m happier at home than anywhere else&quot;.

Charles broke royal tradition when he proceeded straight to university after his A-levels, rather than joining the British Armed Forces. In October 1967, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied archaeology and anthropology for the first part of the Tripos and then switched to history for the second part. During his second year, he attended the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth, studying Welsh history and the Welsh language for one term. Charles became the first British heir apparent to earn a university degree, graduating in June 1970 from the University of Cambridge with a 2:2 Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. Following standard practice, in August 1975, his Bachelor of Arts was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Cantab) degree.

== Prince of Wales ==
Charles was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester on 26 July 1958, though his investiture was not held until 1 July 1969, when he was crowned by his mother in a televised ceremony held at Caernarfon Castle; the investiture was controversial in Wales owing to growing Welsh nationalist sentiment. He took his seat in the House of Lords the following year and he delivered his maiden speech on 13 June 1974, the first royal to speak from the floor since the future Edward VII in 1884. He spoke again in 1975.

Charles began to take on more public duties, founding the Prince&#x27;s Trust in 1976 and travelling to the United States in 1981. In the mid-1970s, he expressed an interest in serving as governor-general of Australia, at the suggestion of Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser; however, because of a lack of public enthusiasm, nothing came of the proposal. In reaction, Charles commented, &quot;so, what are you supposed to think when you are prepared to do something to help and you are just told you&#x27;re not wanted?&quot;
===Military training and career===
Charles served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy in the 1970s. His military training began in 1969, during his second year at Cambridge, where he received Royal Air Force training, learning to fly the Chipmunk aircraft with the Cambridge University Air Squadron, and was presented with his RAF wings in August 1971.

After the passing out parade that September, Charles embarked on a naval career and enrolled in a six-week course at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. Following his naval training he then served from 1971 to 1972 on the guided-missile destroyer and the frigates , from 1972 to 1973, and in 1974. That same year, he also qualified as a helicopter pilot at RNAS Yeovilton, and during his training to be a helicopter pilot underwent commando training at Commando Training Centre Royal Marines at Lympstone. Charles subsequently joined a Royal Marines air support squadron of the Fleet Air Arm, 845 Naval Air Squadron, operating as a pilot, from , flying the Royal Marines commando variant of the Westland Wessex helicopter. 

Charles spent his last 10 months of active service in the Navy commanding the coastal minehunter , beginning on 9 February 1976. He retired from active military service in 1976 at the rank of Commander. Two years later He took part in the parachute training course at RAF Brize Norton after being appointed colonel-in-chief of the Parachute Regiment in 1977, and was a member of Parachute Course 841a. Charles gave up flying after crash-landing a BAe 146 in Islay in 1994, as a passenger who was invited to fly the aircraft; the crew was found negligent by a board of inquiry.

===Relationships and marriages===
====Bachelorhood====
In his youth, Charles was amorously linked to a number of women. His girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of Sir John Russell, who was the British ambassador to Spain; Lady Jane Wellesley, the daughter of the 8th Duke of Wellington; Davina Sheffield; Lady Sarah Spencer; and Camilla Shand, who later became his second wife.
Charles&#x27;s great-uncle Lord Mountbatten advised him to &quot;sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down&quot;, but, for a wife, he &quot;should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for ... It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage&quot;. Early in 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with 25-year-old Charles about a potential marriage to Amanda Knatchbull, Mountbatten&#x27;s granddaughter. Charles wrote to Amanda&#x27;s mother, Lady Brabourne, who was also his godmother, expressing interest in her daughter. Lady Brabourne replied approvingly, but suggested that a courtship with a 16-year-old was premature. Four years later, Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 visit to India. Both fathers, however, objected; Prince Philip feared that his famous uncle would eclipse Charles, while Lord Brabourne warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.

In August 1979, before Charles would depart alone for India, Mountbatten was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army. When Charles returned, he proposed to Amanda. But in addition to her grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and younger brother in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family.

====Lady Diana Spencer====

Charles first met Lady Diana Spencer in 1977, while he was visiting her home, Althorp. He was then the companion of her elder sister Sarah and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While Charles and Diana were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend&#x27;s barbecue in July, she mentioned that he had looked forlorn and in need of care at the funeral of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten. Soon, according to Dimbleby, &quot;without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride&quot; and she accompanied him on visits to Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House.

Charles&#x27;s cousin Norton Knatchbull and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her. Meanwhile, the couple&#x27;s continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and paparazzi. When Charles&#x27;s father told him that the media speculation would injure Diana&#x27;s reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten&#x27;s criteria), Charles construed his father&#x27;s advice as a warning to proceed without further delay. He proposed to Diana in February 1981, with their engagement becoming official on 24 February; the wedding took place in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 29 July. Upon his marriage, Charles reduced his voluntary tax contribution from the profits of the Duchy of Cornwall from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. The couple lived at Kensington Palace and Highgrove House, near Tetbury, and had two children: William, in 1982, and Harry, in 1984.

Within five years, the marriage was in trouble due to the couple&#x27;s incompatibility and near 13-year age difference. In 1986, Charles had fully resumed his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. In a videotape recorded by Peter Settelen in 1992, Diana admitted that, from 1985 to 1986, she had been &quot;deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment.&quot; It was assumed that she was referring to Barry Mannakee, who had been transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986, after his managers determined his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate. Diana later commenced a relationship with Major James Hewitt, the family&#x27;s former riding instructor.

Charles and Diana&#x27;s evident discomfort in each other&#x27;s company led to them being dubbed &quot;The Glums&quot; by the press. Diana exposed Charles&#x27;s affair with Parker Bowles in a book by Andrew Morton, &quot;&quot;. Audio tapes of her own extramarital flirtations also surfaced, as did persistent suggestions that Hewitt is Prince Harry&#x27;s father, based on a physical similarity between Hewitt and Harry. However, Harry had already been born by the time Diana&#x27;s affair with Hewitt began.

In December 1992, John Major announced the couple&#x27;s legal separation in the House of Commons. Early the following year, the British press published transcripts of a passionate, bugged telephone conversation between Charles and Parker Bowles that had taken place in 1989, which was dubbed &quot;Camillagate&quot; and &quot;Tampongate&quot;. Charles subsequently sought public understanding in a television film with Dimbleby, &quot;&quot;, broadcast in June 1994. In an interview in the film, Charles confirmed his own extramarital affair with Parker Bowles, saying that he had rekindled their association in 1986, only after his marriage to Diana had &quot;irretrievably broken down&quot;. This was followed by Diana&#x27;s own admission of marital troubles in an interview on the BBC current affairs show &quot;Panorama&quot;, broadcast in November 1995. Referring to Charles&#x27;s relationship with Parker Bowles, she said, &quot;well, there were three of us in this marriage. So, it was a bit crowded.&quot; She also expressed doubt about her husband&#x27;s suitability for kingship. Charles and Diana divorced on 28 August 1996, after being advised by the Queen in December 1995 to end the marriage. The couple shared custody of their children.

Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997. Charles flew to Paris with Diana&#x27;s sisters to accompany her body back to Britain. In 2003, Diana&#x27;s butler Paul Burrell published a note that he claimed had been written by Diana in 1995, in which there were allegations that Charles was &quot;planning &#x27;an accident&#x27; in [Diana&#x27;s] car, brake failure and serious head injury&quot;, so that he could remarry. When questioned by the Metropolitan Police inquiry team as a part of Operation Paget, Charles told the authorities that he did not know about his former wife&#x27;s note from 1995 and could not understand why she had those feelings.

====Camilla Parker Bowles====

In 1999, Charles and Parker Bowles made their first public appearance as a couple at the Ritz London Hotel, and she moved into Charles&#x27;s official residence, Clarence House, in 2003. Their engagement was announced on 10 February 2005. The Queen&#x27;s consent to the marriageas required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772was recorded in a Privy Council meeting on 2 March. In Canada, the Department of Justice determined the consent of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada was not required, as the union would not produce any heirs to the Canadian throne.

Charles was the only member of the royal family to have a civil, rather than a church, wedding in England. British government documents from the 1950s and 1960s, published by the BBC, stated that such a marriage was illegal; these claims were dismissed by Charles&#x27;s spokesman and explained by the sitting government to have been repealed by the Registration Service Act 1953.

The union was scheduled to take place in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, with a subsequent religious blessing at the castle&#x27;s St George&#x27;s Chapel. The wedding venue was changed to Windsor Guildhall after it was realised a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to be available to anyone who wished to be married there. Four days before the event, it was postponed from the originally scheduled date of 8 April until the following day in order to allow Charles and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.

Charles&#x27;s parents did not attend the marriage ceremony; the Queen&#x27;s reluctance to attend possibly arose from her position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. However, his parents did attend the service of blessing and held a reception for the newlyweds at Windsor Castle. The blessing by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was televised.

=== Official duties ===
In 1965, Charles undertook his first public engagement by attending a student garden party at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. During his time as Prince of Wales, he undertook official duties on behalf of the Queen, completing 10,934 engagements between 2002 and 2022. He officiated at investitures and attended the funerals of foreign dignitaries. Charles made regular tours of Wales, fulfilling a week of engagements each summer, and attending important national occasions, such as opening the Senedd. The six trustees of the Royal Collection Trust met three times a year under his chairmanship. Charles also represented his mother at the independence celebrations in Fiji in 1970, The Bahamas in 1973, Papua New Guinea in 1975, Zimbabwe in 1980, and Brunei in 1984.

In 1983, Christopher John Lewis, who had fired a shot with a .22 rifle at the Queen in 1981, attempted to escape a psychiatric hospital in order to assassinate Charles, who was visiting New Zealand with Diana and William. While Charles was visiting Australia on Australia Day in January 1994, David Kang fired two shots at him from a starting pistol in protest of the treatment of several hundred Cambodian asylum seekers held in detention camps. In 1995, Charles became the first member of the royal family to visit the Republic of Ireland in an official capacity. In 1997 he represented the Queen at the Hong Kong handover ceremony.
At the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Charles caused controversy when he shook hands with the president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, who had been seated next to him. Charles&#x27;s office subsequently released a statement saying that he could not avoid shaking Mugabe&#x27;s hand and that he &quot;finds the current Zimbabwean regime abhorrent&quot;.

Charles represented the Queen at the opening ceremony of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India. In November 2010, he and Camilla were indirectly involved in student protests when their car was attacked by protesters. In November 2013, he represented the Queen for the first time at a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

Charles and Camilla made their first joint trip to the Republic of Ireland in May 2015. The British Embassy called the trip an important step in &quot;promoting peace and reconciliation&quot;. During the trip, he shook hands in Galway with Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Féin and widely believed to be the leader of the IRA, the militant group that had assassinated Lord Mountbatten in 1979. The event was described by the media as a &quot;historic handshake&quot; and a &quot;significant moment for Anglo-Irish relations&quot;.
Commonwealth heads of government decided at their 2018 meeting that Charles would be the next Head of the Commonwealth after the Queen. The head is chosen and therefore not hereditary. In March 2019, at the request of the British government, Charles and Camilla went on an official tour of Cuba, making them the first British royals to visit the country. The tour was seen as an effort to form a closer relationship between Cuba and the United Kingdom.

Charles contracted COVID-19 during the pandemic in March 2020. Several newspapers were critical that Charles and Camilla were tested promptly at a time when many NHS doctors, nurses and patients had been unable to be tested expeditiously. He tested positive for COVID-19 for a second time in February 2022. He and Camilla, who also tested positive, had received doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021.
Charles attended the November 2021 ceremonies to mark Barbados&#x27;s transition into a parliamentary republic, abolishing the position of monarch of Barbados. He was invited by Prime Minister Mia Mottley as the future Head of the Commonwealth; it was the first time that a member of the royal family attended the transition of a realm to a republic. In May of the following year, Charles attended the State Opening of the British Parliament, delivering the Queen&#x27;s Speech on behalf of his mother, as a counsellor of state.

== Reign ==
Charles acceded to the British throne on his mother&#x27;s death on 8 September 2022. He was the longest-serving British heir apparent, having surpassed Edward VII&#x27;s record of 59 years on 20 April 2011. Charles was the oldest person to succeed to the British throne, at the age of 73. The previous record holder, William IV, was 64 when he became king in 1830.

Charles gave his first speech to the nation at 6 pm on 9 September, in which he paid tribute to his mother and announced the appointment of his elder son, William, as Prince of Wales. The following day, the Accession Council publicly proclaimed Charles as king, the ceremony being televised for the first time. Attendees included Queen Camilla, Prince William, and the British prime minister, Liz Truss, along with her six living predecessors. The proclamation was also read out by local authorities around the United Kingdom. Other realms signed and read their own proclamations, as did Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the British Overseas Territories, the Crown Dependencies, Canadian provinces, and Australian states.
Charles and Camilla&#x27;s coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 6 May 2023. Plans had been made for many years, under the code name &quot;Operation Golden Orb&quot;. Reports before his accession suggested that Charles&#x27;s coronation would be simpler than his mother&#x27;s in 1953, with the ceremony expected to be &quot;shorter, smaller, less expensive, and more representative of different faiths and community groupsfalling in line with the King&#x27;s wish to reflect the ethnic diversity of modern Britain&quot;. Nonetheless, the coronation was a Church of England rite, including the coronation oath, the anointment, delivery of the orb, and enthronement. In July that year, the royal couple attended a national service of thanksgiving where Charles was presented with the Honours of Scotland in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral.

In July 2023, Charles asked for the profits from Britain&#x27;s growing fleet of offshore windfarms to be used for the &quot;wider public good&quot; rather than as extra funding for the monarchy. It was announced that the funding of the monarchy would be reduced to 12 per cent of the Crown Estate&#x27;s net profits.

In November 2022, the King and Queen hosted the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, during the first official state visit to Britain of Charles III&#x27;s reign. In March the following year, the King and Queen embarked on a state visit to Germany; Charles became the first British monarch to address the Bundestag. Similarly, in September, he became the first British monarch to give a speech from France&#x27;s Senate chamber during his state visit to the country. The following month, Charles visited Kenya where he faced pressure to apologise for British colonial actions. In a speech at the state banquet, he acknowledged &quot;abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence&quot;, but did not formally apologise.
In May 2024, the British prime minister Rishi Sunak asked the King to call a general election; subsequently royal engagements which could divert attention from the election campaign were postponed. In June 2024, Charles and Camilla travelled to Normandy to attend the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day. The same month, he received Emperor Naruhito of Japan during the latter&#x27;s state visit to the United Kingdom. In July the annual Holyrood Week, which is usually spent in Scotland, was shortened so that Charles could return to London and appoint a new prime minister following the general election. After Sunak&#x27;s Conservatives lost the election to the Labour Party led by Sir Keir Starmer, Charles appointed Starmer as prime minister.
In October 2024, the King and Queen toured Australia and Samoa; Australia was the first overseas Commonwealth realm he visited since his accession. In Samoa, Charles attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting for the first time as head of the Commonwealth. The tour was significantly scaled back owing to his cancer diagnosis, a planned visit to New Zealand being among the cancelled events. Charles temporarily paused cancer treatment during the tour.

== Health ==
In March 1998, Charles had laser keyhole surgery on his right knee. In March 2003, he underwent surgery at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital to treat a hernia injury. In 2008, a non-cancerous growth was removed from his nasal bridge.

In January 2024, Charles underwent a &quot;corrective procedure&quot; at the London Clinic to treat benign prostate enlargement, which resulted in the postponement of some of his public engagements. In February, Buckingham Palace announced that cancer had been discovered during the treatment, but that it was not prostate cancer. Although his public duties were postponed, it was reported Charles would continue to fulfil his constitutional functions during his outpatient treatment. He released a statement espousing his support for cancer charities and that he &quot;remain[ed] positive&quot; on making a full recovery. In March, Camilla deputised for him in his absence at the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey and at the Royal Maundy at Worcester Cathedral. He made his first major public appearance since his cancer diagnosis at the Easter service held at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 31 March. In April 2024, it was announced that he would resume public-facing duties after making progress in his cancer treatment.

===Diet===
As early as 1985, Charles was questioning meat consumption. In the &quot;1985 Royal Special&quot; television programme&quot;,&quot; he told host Alastair Burnet that &quot;I actually now don&#x27;t eat as much meat as I used to. I eat more fish.&quot; He also pointed out the societal double standard whereby eating meat is not questioned but eating less meat means &quot;all hell seems to break loose.&quot; In 2021, Charles spoke to the BBC about the environment and revealed that, two days per week, he eats no meat nor fish and, one day per week, he eats no dairy products. In 2022, it was reported that he eats a breakfast of fruit salad, seeds, and tea. He does not eat lunch, but takes a break for tea at 5:00 p.m. and eats dinner at 8:30 p.m., returning to work until midnight or after. Ahead of Christmas dinner in 2022, Charles confirmed to animal rights group PETA that foie gras would not be served at any royal residences; he had stopped the use of foie gras at his own properties for more than a decade before becoming king. During a September 2023 state banquet at the Palace of Versailles, it was reported that he did not want foie gras or out-of-season asparagus on the menu. Instead, he was served lobster.

== Charity work ==
Since founding the Prince&#x27;s Trust in 1976, using his £7,500 of severance pay from the Navy, Charles has established 16 more charitable organisations and now serves as president of each. Together, they form a loose alliance, the Prince&#x27;s Charities, which describes itself as &quot;the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom, raising more than £100 million annually ... [and is] active across a broad range of areas including education and young people, environmental sustainability, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise, and international&quot;. As Prince of Wales, Charles became patron or president of more than 800 other charities and organisations.

The Prince&#x27;s Charities Canada was established in 2010, in a similar fashion to its namesake in Britain. Charles uses his tours of Canada as a way to help draw attention to youth, the disabled, the environment, the arts, medicine, the elderly, heritage conservation, and education. He has also set up the Prince&#x27;s Charities Australia, based in Melbourne, to provide a coordinating presence for his Australian and international charitable endeavours.
Charles has supported humanitarian projects; for example, he and his sons took part in ceremonies that marked the 1998 International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Charles was one of the first public figures to express strong concerns about the human rights record of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, initiating objections in the international arena, and subsequently supported the FARA Foundation, a charity for Romanian orphans and abandoned children.

=== Investigations of donations ===
Two of Charles&#x27;s charities, the Prince&#x27;s Foundation and the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Charitable Fund (later renamed the King&#x27;s Foundation and King Charles III Charitable Fund, respectively), came under scrutiny in 2021 and 2022 for accepting donations the media deemed inappropriate. In August 2021, it was announced that the Prince&#x27;s Foundation was launching an investigation into the reports, with Charles&#x27;s support. The Charity Commission also launched an investigation into allegations that the donations meant for the Prince&#x27;s Foundation had been instead sent to the Mahfouz Foundation. In February 2022, the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into the cash-for-honours allegations linked to the foundation, passing their evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service for deliberation in October. In August 2023, the Metropolitan Police announced that they had concluded their investigations and no further actions would be taken.

&quot;The Times&quot; reported in June 2022 that, between 2011 and 2015, Charles accepted €3 million in cash from Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. There was no evidence that the payments were illegal or that it was not intended for the money to go to the charity, although, the Charity Commission stated it would review the information and announced in July 2022 that there would be no further investigation. In the same month, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Charitable Fund received a donation of £1 million from Bakr bin Laden and Shafiq bin Ladenboth half-brothers of Osama bin Ladenduring a private meeting in 2013. The Charity Commission described the decision to accept donations as a &quot;matter for trustees&quot; and added that no investigation was required.

== Personal interests ==
From young adulthood, Charles encouraged the understanding of Indigenous voices, saying they held crucial messages about preservation of the land, respecting community and shared values, resolving conflict, and recognising and making good on past iniquities. He dovetailed this view with his efforts against climate change, as well as reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and his charitable work in Canada. At CHOGM 2022, Charles, who was representing his mother, raised that reconciliation process as an example for dealing with the history of slavery in the British Empire, for which he expressed his sorrow.

Letters sent by Charles to government ministers in 2004 and 2005 expressing his concerns over various policy issuesthe so-called black spider memospresented potential embarrassment following a challenge by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper to release the letters under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In March 2015, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom decided that Charles&#x27;s letters must be released. The Cabinet Office published the letters in May that year. The reaction was largely supportive of Charles, with little criticism of him; the press variously described the memos as &quot;underwhelming&quot; and &quot;harmless&quot;, and concluded that their release had &quot;backfired on those who seek to belittle him&quot;. It was revealed in the same year that Charles had access to confidential Cabinet papers.

In October 2020, a letter sent by Charles to the governor-general of Australia, Sir John Kerr, after Kerr&#x27;s dismissal of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in 1975, was released as part of the collection of palace letters regarding the Australian constitutional crisis. In the letter, Charles was supportive of Kerr&#x27;s decision, writing that what Kerr &quot;did last year was right and the courageous thing to do&quot;.

&quot;The Times&quot; reported in June 2022 that Charles had privately described the British government&#x27;s Rwanda asylum plan as &quot;appalling&quot; and he feared that it would overshadow the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Rwanda that same month. It was later claimed that Cabinet ministers had warned Charles to avoid making political comments, as they feared a constitutional crisis could arise if he continued to make such statements once he became king.

=== Built environment ===
Charles has openly expressed his views on architecture and urban planning; he fostered the advancement of New Classical architecture and asserted that he &quot;care[s] deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life.&quot; In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects in May 1984, he described a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London as a &quot;monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend&quot; and deplored the &quot;glass stumps and concrete towers&quot; of modern architecture. Charles called for local community involvement in architectural choices and asked, &quot;why has everything got to be vertical, straight, unbending, only at right anglesand functional?&quot; Charles has &quot;a deep understanding of Islamic art and architecture&quot; and has been involved in the construction of a building and garden at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, which combine Islamic and Oxford architectural styles.
In Charles&#x27;s 1989 book &quot;A Vision of Britain&quot;, and in speeches and essays, he has been critical of modern architecture, arguing that traditional designs and methods should guide contemporary ones. He has continued to campaign for traditional urbanism, human scale, restoration of historic buildings, and sustainable design despite criticism in the press. Two of his charitiesthe Prince&#x27;s Regeneration Trust and the Prince&#x27;s Foundation for Building Community, which were later merged into one charitypromote his views. The village of Poundbury was built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall to a master plan by Léon Krier, under the guidance of Charles and in line with his philosophy. In 2013, developments for the suburb of Nansledan began on the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall with Charles&#x27;s endorsement. Charles helped purchase Dumfries House and its complete collection of 18th century furnishings in 2007, taking a £20m loan from his charitable trust to contribute toward the £45m cost. The house and gardens remain property of the Prince&#x27;s Foundation and serve as a museum and community and skills training centre. This led to the development of Knockroon, called the &quot;Scottish Poundbury&quot;.

After lamenting in 1996 the unbridled destruction of many of Canada&#x27;s historic urban cores, Charles offered his assistance to the Department of Canadian Heritage in creating a trust modelled on Britain&#x27;s National Trust, a plan that was implemented with the passage of the federal budget in 2007. In 1999, Charles agreed to the use of his title for the Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership, awarded by the National Trust for Canada to municipal governments that have committed to the conservation of historic places.

Whilst visiting the US and surveying the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, Charles received the National Building Museum&#x27;s Vincent Scully Prize in 2005 for his efforts in regard to architecture; he donated $25,000 of the prize money towards restoring storm-damaged communities. For his work as patron of New Classical architecture, Charles was awarded the 2012 Driehaus Architecture Prize from the University of Notre Dame. The Worshipful Company of Carpenters installed Charles as an Honorary Liveryman &quot;in recognition of his interest in London&#x27;s architecture.&quot;

Charles has occasionally intervened in projects that employ architectural styles such as modernism and functionalism. In 2009, Charles wrote to the Qatari royal familythe financier of the redevelopment of the Chelsea Barracks sitelabelling Lord Rogers&#x27;s design for the site &quot;unsuitable&quot;. Rogers claimed that Charles had also intervened to block his designs for the Royal Opera House and Paternoster Square. CPC Group, the project developer, took a case against Qatari Diar to the High Court. After the suit was settled, the CPC Group apologised to Charles &quot;for any offence caused... during the course of the proceedings&quot;.

=== Natural environment ===
Since the 1970s, Charles has promoted environmental awareness. At the age of 21, he delivered his first speech on environmental issues in his capacity as the chairman of the Welsh Countryside Committee. An avid gardener, Charles has also emphasised the importance of talking to plants, stating that &quot;I happily talk to the plants and trees, and listen to them. I think it&#x27;s absolutely crucial&quot;. His interest in gardening began in 1980 when he took over the Highgrove estate. His &quot;healing garden&quot;, based on sacred geometry and ancient religious symbolism, went on display at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2002.

Upon moving into Highgrove House, Charles developed an interest in organic farming, which culminated in the 1990 launch of his own organic brand, Duchy Originals, which sells more than 200 different sustainably produced products; the profits (more than £6 million by 2010) are donated to the Prince&#x27;s Charities. Charles became involved with farming and various industries within it, regularly meeting with farmers to discuss their trade. A prominent critic of the practice, Charles has also spoken against the use of GM crops, and in a letter to Tony Blair in 1998, Charles criticised the development of genetically modified foods.

The Sustainable Markets Initiativea project that encourages putting sustainability at the centre of all activitieswas launched by Charles at the World Economic Forum&#x27;s annual meeting in Davos in January 2020. In May of the same year, the initiative and the World Economic Forum initiated the Great Reset project, a five-point plan concerned with enhancing sustainable economic growth following the global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The holy chrism oil used at Charles&#x27;s coronation was vegan, made from oils of olive, sesame, rose, jasmine, cinnamon, neroli, and benzoin, along with amber and orange blossom. His mother&#x27;s chrism oil contained animal-based oils.

Charles delivered a speech at the 2021 G20 Rome summit, describing COP26 as &quot;the last chance saloon&quot; for preventing climate change and asking for actions that would lead to a green-led, sustainable economy. In his speech at the opening ceremony for COP26, he repeated his sentiments from the previous year, stating that &quot;a vast military-style campaign&quot; was needed &quot;to marshal the strength of the global private sector&quot; for tackling climate change. In 2022, the media alleged that Liz Truss had advised Charles against attending COP27, to which advice he agreed. Charles delivered the opening speech at COP28, saying among others he prayed &quot;with all my heart that COP28 will be a critical turning point towards genuine transformational action.&quot;

Charles, who is patron of the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, introduced the Climate Action Scholarships for students from small island nations in partnership with University of Cambridge, University of Toronto, University of Melbourne, McMaster University, and University of Montreal in March 2022. In 2010 he funded The Prince&#x27;s Countryside Fund (renamed The Royal Countryside Fund in 2023), a charity which aims for a &quot;confident, robust and sustainable agricultural and rural community&quot;.

=== Alternative medicine ===
Charles has controversially championed alternative medicine, including homeopathy. He first publicly expressed his interest in the topic in December 1982, in an address to the British Medical Association. This speech was seen as &quot;combative&quot; and &quot;critical&quot; of modern medicine and was met with anger by some medical professionals. Similarly, the Prince&#x27;s Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) attracted opposition from the scientific and medical community over its campaign encouraging general practitioners to offer herbal and other alternative treatments to NHS patients.

In April 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; published a letter from Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, which asked the FIH to recall two guides promoting alternative medicine. That year, Ernst published a book with Simon Singh called &quot;Trick or Treatment: Alternative Medicine on Trial&quot; and mockingly dedicated to &quot;HRH the Prince of Wales&quot;. The last chapter is highly critical of Charles&#x27;s advocacy of complementary and alternative treatments.

Charles&#x27;s Duchy Originals produced a variety of complementary medicinal products, including a &quot;Detox Tincture&quot; that Ernst denounced as &quot;financially exploiting the vulnerable&quot; and &quot;outright quackery&quot;. Charles personally wrote at least seven letters to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency shortly before it relaxed the rules governing labelling of such herbal products, a move that was widely condemned by scientists and medical bodies. It was reported in October 2009 that Charles had lobbied the health secretary, Andy Burnham, regarding greater provision of alternative treatments in the NHS.

Following accounting irregularities, the FIH announced its closure in April 2010. The FIH was re-branded and re-launched later in 2010 as the College of Medicine, of which Charles became a patron in 2019.

=== Sports ===
From his youth until 2005, Charles was an avid player of competitive polo. Charles also frequently took part in fox hunting until the sport was banned in the United Kingdom, also in 2005. By the late 1990s, opposition to the activity was growing when Charles&#x27;s participation was viewed as a &quot;political statement&quot; by those who were opposed to it. Charles suffered several polo and hunting-related injuries throughout the years, including a two-inch scar on his left cheek in 1980, a broken arm in 1990, a torn cartilage in his left knee in 1992, a broken rib in 1998, and a fractured shoulder in 2001.

Charles has been a keen salmon angler since youth and supported Orri Vigfússon&#x27;s efforts to protect the North Atlantic salmon. He frequently fishes the River Dee in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and claims his most special angling memories are from his time spent in Vopnafjörður, Iceland. Charles is a supporter of Burnley F.C.

Apart from hunting, Charles has also participated in target rifle competitions, representing the House of Lords in the Vizianagram Match (Lords vs. Commons) at Bisley. He became President of the British National Rifle Association in 1977.

=== Visual, performing, and literary arts ===

Charles has been involved in performance since his youth, and appeared in sketches and revues while studying at Cambridge.
Charles is president or patron of more than 20 performing arts organisations, including the Royal College of Music, Royal Opera, English Chamber Orchestra, Philharmonia Orchestra, Welsh National Opera, Royal Shakespeare Company (attending performances in Stratford-Upon-Avon, supporting fundraising events, and attending the company&#x27;s annual general meeting), British Film Institute, and Purcell School. In 2000, he revived the tradition of appointing an official harpist to the Prince of Wales, in order to foster Welsh talent at playing the national instrument of Wales.

Charles is a keen watercolourist, having published books on the subject and exhibited and sold a number of his works to raise money for charity; in 2016, it was estimated that he had sold lithographs of his watercolours for a total of £2 million from a shop at his Highgrove House residence. For his 50th birthday, 50 of his watercolours were exhibited at Hampton Court Palace and, for his 70th birthday, his works were exhibited at the National Gallery of Australia. In 2001, 20 lithographs of his watercolour paintings illustrating his country estates were exhibited at the Florence International Biennale of Contemporary Art and 79 of his paintings were put on display in London in 2022. To mark the 25th anniversary of his investiture as Prince of Wales in 1994, the Royal Mail issued a series of postage stamps that featured his paintings. Charles is Honorary President of the Royal Academy of Arts Development Trust and, in 2015, 2022, and 2023, commissioned paintings of 12 D-Day veterans, seven Holocaust survivors, and ten members of the Windrush generation, respectively, which went on display at the Queen&#x27;s Gallery in Buckingham Palace.

Charles is the author of several books and has contributed a foreword or preface to numerous books by others. He has also been featured in a variety of documentary films.

=== Religion and philosophy ===
Shortly after his accession to the throne, Charles publicly described himself as &quot;a committed Anglican Christian&quot;; at age 16, during Easter 1965, he had been confirmed into the Anglican Communion by Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The King is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England and a member of the Church of Scotland; he swore an oath to uphold that church immediately after he was proclaimed king. He attends services at various Anglican churches close to Highgrove and attends the Church of Scotland&#x27;s Crathie Kirk with the rest of the royal family when staying at Balmoral Castle.
Laurens van der Post became a friend of Charles in 1977; he was dubbed Charles&#x27;s &quot;spiritual guru&quot; and was godfather to Prince William. From van der Post, Charles developed a focus on philosophy and an interest in other religions. Charles expressed his philosophical views in his 2010 book, &quot;&quot;, which won a Nautilus Book Award. He has also visited Eastern Orthodox monasteries on Mount Athos, in Romania, and in Serbia, and met with Eastern Church leaders in Jerusalem in 2020, during a visit that culminated in an ecumenical service in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and a walk through the city accompanied by Christian and Muslim dignitaries. Charles also attended the consecration of Britain&#x27;s first Syriac Orthodox cathedral, St Thomas Cathedral, Acton. Charles is patron of the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies at the University of Oxford and attended the inauguration of the Markfield Institute of Higher Education, which is dedicated to Islamic studies in a multicultural context.
In his 1994 documentary with Dimbleby, Charles said that, when king, he wished to be seen as a &quot;defender of faith&quot;, rather than the British monarch&#x27;s traditional title of &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;, &quot;preferr[ing] to embrace all religious traditions and &#x27;the pattern of the divine, which I think is in all of us. This attracted controversy at the time, as well as speculation that the coronation oath might be altered. He stated in 2015 that he would retain the title of &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;, whilst &quot;ensuring that other people&#x27;s faiths can also be practised&quot;, which he sees as a duty of the Church of England. Charles reaffirmed this theme shortly after his accession and declared that his duties as sovereign included &quot;the duty to protect the diversity of our country, including by protecting the space for faith itself and its practice through the religions, cultures, traditions, and beliefs to which our hearts and minds direct us as individuals.&quot;

His inclusive, multi-faith approach and his own Christian beliefs were expressed in his first Christmas message as king. In line with his multi-faith approach, Charles has served as a patron of the Council of Christians and Jews and of the Jewish Museum London.

== Media image and public opinion ==

Since his birth, Charles has received close media attention, which increased as he matured. It has been an ambivalent relationship, largely impacted by his marriages to Diana and Camilla and their aftermath, but also centred on his future conduct as king.
Described as the &quot;world&#x27;s most eligible bachelor&quot; in the late 1970s, Charles was subsequently overshadowed by Diana. After her death, the media regularly breached Charles&#x27;s privacy and printed exposés. Known for expressing his opinions, when asked during an interview to mark his 70th birthday whether this would continue in the same way once he is king, he responded &quot;No. It won&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not that stupid. I do realise that it is a separate exercise being sovereign. So, of course, you know, I understand entirely how that should operate.&quot; In 2009 Charles was named the world&#x27;s best-dressed man by &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. In 2023 the &quot;New Statesman&quot; named Charles as the fourth most powerful right-wing figure of the year, describing him as a &quot;romantic traditionalist&quot; and &quot;the very last reactionary in public life&quot; for his support of various traditionalist think-tanks and previous writings.

A 2018 BMG Research poll found that 46 per cent of Britons wanted Charles to abdicate immediately on his mother&#x27;s death, in favour of William. However, a 2021 opinion poll reported that 60 per cent of the British public had a favourable opinion of him. On his accession to the throne, &quot;The Statesman&quot; reported an opinion poll that put Charles&#x27;s popularity with the British people at 42 per cent. More recent polling suggested that his popularity increased sharply after he became king. , Charles had an approval rating of 62 per cent, according to statistics and polling company YouGov.

=== Reaction to press treatment ===
In 1994 the German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; published nude photos of Charles that were taken while he was vacationing in Le Barroux; they had reportedly been put up for sale for £30,000. Buckingham Palace reacted by stating that it was &quot;unjustifiable for anybody to suffer this sort of intrusion&quot;.

Charles, &quot;so often a target of the press, got his chance to return fire&quot; in 2002, when addressing &quot;scores of editors, publishers, and other media executives&quot; gathered at St Bride&#x27;s Fleet Street to celebrate 300 years of journalism. Defending public servants from &quot;the corrosive drip of constant criticism&quot;, he noted that the press had been &quot;awkward, cantankerous, cynical, bloody-minded, at times intrusive, at times inaccurate, and at times deeply unfair and harmful to individuals and to institutions.&quot; But, he concluded, regarding his own relations with the press, &quot;from time to time we are probably both a bit hard on each other, exaggerating the downsides and ignoring the good points in each.&quot;
In 2006 Charles filed a court case against &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, after excerpts of his personal journals were published, revealing his opinions on matters such as the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China in 1997, in which Charles described the Chinese government officials as &quot;appalling old waxworks&quot;. Charles and Camilla were named in 2011 as individuals whose confidential information was reportedly targeted or actually acquired in conjunction with the news media phone hacking scandal.

&quot;The Independent&quot; noted in 2015 that Charles would only speak to broadcasters &quot;on the condition they have signed a 15-page contract, demanding that Clarence House attends both the &#x27;rough cut&#x27; and &#x27;fine cut&#x27; edits of films and, if it is unhappy with the final product, can &#x27;remove the contribution in its entirety from the programme&#x27;.&quot; This contract stipulated that all questions directed at Charles must be pre-approved and vetted by his representatives.

== Residences and finance ==
In 2023 &quot;The Guardian&quot; estimated Charles&#x27;s personal wealth at £1.8 billion. This estimate includes the assets of the Duchy of Lancaster worth £653 million (and paying Charles an annual income of £20 million), jewels worth £533 million, real estate worth £330 million, shares and investments worth £142 million, a stamp collection worth at least £100 million, racehorses worth £27 million, artworks worth £24 million, and cars worth £6.3 million. Most of this wealth which he inherited from his mother was exempt from inheritance tax.

Clarence House, previously the residence of the Queen Mother, was Charles&#x27;s official London residence from 2003, after being renovated at a cost of £6.1 million. He previously shared apartments eight and nine at Kensington Palace with Diana before moving to York House at St James&#x27;s Palace, which remained his principal residence until 2003. Highgrove House in Gloucestershire is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, having been purchased for Charles&#x27;s use in 1980, and which he rented for £336,000 per annum. Since William became Duke of Cornwall, Charles is expected to pay £700,000 per annum for use of the property. Charles also owns a property near the village of Viscri in Romania.

As Prince of Wales, Charles&#x27;s primary source of income was generated from the Duchy of Cornwall, which owns 133,658 acres of land (around 54,090 hectares), including farming, residential, and commercial properties, as well as an investment portfolio. Since 1993, he has paid tax voluntarily under the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding on Royal Taxation&quot;, updated in 2013. Her Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs were asked in December 2012 to investigate alleged tax avoidance by the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy is named in the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment that were leaked to the German newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;.

== Titles, styles, honours, and arms ==


=== Titles and styles ===
Charles has held many titles and honorary military positions throughout the Commonwealth, is sovereign of many orders in his own countries and has received honours and awards from around the world. In each of his realms, he has a distinct title that follows a similar formula: &quot;King of Saint Lucia and of His other Realms and Territories&quot; in Saint Lucia, &quot;King of Australia and His other Realms and Territories&quot; in Australia, etc. In the Isle of Man, which is a Crown Dependency rather than a separate realm, he is known as Lord of Mann. Charles is also styled &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;.

There had been speculation throughout Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign as to what regnal name Charles would choose upon his accession; instead of &quot;Charles III&quot;, he could have chosen to reign as &quot;George VII&quot; or used one of his other given names. It was reported that he might use George in honour of his grandfather George VI and to avoid associations with previous controversial kings named Charles. Charles&#x27;s office asserted in 2005 that no decision had yet been made. Speculation continued for a few hours following his mother&#x27;s death, until Liz Truss announced and Clarence House confirmed that Charles had chosen the regnal name &quot;Charles III&quot;.

Charles, who left active military service in 1976, was awarded the highest rank in all three armed services in 2012 by his mother: Admiral of the Fleet, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force.

=== Arms ===
As Prince of Wales, Charles&#x27;s coat of arms was based on the arms of the United Kingdom, differenced with a white label and an inescutcheon of the Principality of Wales, surmounted by the heir apparent&#x27;s crown, and with the motto (, &quot;I serve&quot;) instead of &quot;Dieu et mon droit&quot;.

When Charles became king, he inherited the royal coats of arms of the United Kingdom and of Canada. The design of his royal cypher, featuring a depiction of the Tudor crown instead of St Edward&#x27;s Crown, was revealed on 27 September 2022. The College of Arms envisages that the Tudor crown will be used in new arms, uniforms and crown badges as they are replaced.

=== Banners, flags, and standards ===
==== As heir apparent ====
The banners used by Charles as Prince of Wales varied depending upon location. His personal standard for the United Kingdom was the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom differenced as in his arms, with a label of three points &quot;argent&quot; and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre. It was used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when Charles was acting in an official capacity associated with the British Armed Forces.

The personal flag for use in Wales was based upon the Royal Badge of Wales. In Scotland, the personal banner used between 1974 and 2022 was based upon three ancient Scottish titles: Duke of Rothesay (heir apparent to the King of Scots), High Steward of Scotland, and Lord of the Isles. In Cornwall, the banner was the arms of the Duke of Cornwall.

In 2011, the Canadian Heraldic Authority introduced a personal heraldic banner for the Prince of Wales for Canada, consisting of the shield of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada defaced with both a blue roundel of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers surrounded by a wreath of gold maple leaves and a white label of three points.
==== As sovereign ====
The royal standard of the United Kingdom is used to represent the King in the United Kingdom and on official visits overseas, except in Australia and Canada. It is the royal arms in banner form undifferentiated, having been used by successive British monarchs since 1702. The royal standard of Canada is used by the King in Canada and while acting on behalf of Canada overseas. It is the &quot;escutcheon&quot; of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada in banner form undifferentiated.

<text>Bethlehem Township is a township in Hunterdon County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 3,745, a decrease of 234 (−5.9%) from the 2010 census count of 3,979, which in turn reflected an increase of 159 (+4.2%) from the 3,820 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Before European settlement, the land was settled by the Lenape Native Americans, whose presence remains in the names of places and bodies of water in the township.

Bethlehem was first mentioned in official records dating back to 1730, though details of its formation are uncertain. Bethlehem was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form Kingwood Township (1749, date uncertain), Alexandria Township (March 5, 1765), Union Township (February 17, 1853), Junction borough (February 20, 1895, now known as Hampton borough), Bloomsbury (March 30, 1905) and Glen Gardner (March 26, 1919).

The township was named for the city of Bethlehem.

==Geography==

<doc id="125251" wikidata="Q515694" url="?curid=125251" title="Califon, New Jersey">
<text>Califon is a borough in Hunterdon County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,005, a decrease of 71 (−6.6%) from the 2010 census count of 1,076, which in turn reflected an increase of 21 (+2.0%) from the 1,055 counted in the 2000 census.

The borough&#x27;s name is said to have been inspired by the California gold rush of 1849. The name was shortened to Califon, supposedly because the longer name could not be fit on signs at the train station.

==History==

Califon was a station on the High Bridge Branch of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The station was built in 1875 and is now used as a museum by the Califon Historical Society. The rail line was abandoned in 1976 and now serves as a Hunterdon County-administered rail trail called Columbia Trail, which runs south to High Bridge and north to points in Morris County.

Though the mills were present in the area of Califon for some time prior to its incorporation as a town, it was quite a while before growth became evident in the mid-nineteenth century. The J. K. Apgar Farmhouse, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, exemplifies the early stone farmhouses constructed in the region in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The area that would become Califon was first called California, from Jacob Neighbor&#x27;s enthusiasm in the milling business about the time the California Gold Rush broke out. The borough was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of both Lebanon and Tewksbury Townships on April 2, 1918.

Local legend has it that California became a regular stop for weekend excursion trains through the countryside. When riders bought their tickets they were issued a voucher good for an ice cream; the train would stop so tourists could wander around and cash in their ice cream coupons. Anxious to exploit this source of outside revenue, residents petitioned the railroad to let them build a real station, which they did as a community project. Citing the local account again, two sign painters who came to letter the sign rode the train from Dunellen, but the background paint wasn&#x27;t dry when they arrived. They sat and drank at the hotel, which later burned down. By the time the sign was ready for their artistic touch, the local tale says, &quot;Califon&quot; was as close to California as the inebriated painters could manage.

Califon is situated just north of the Ken Lockwood Gorge on the South Branch of the Raritan River; this pristine stretch of clear water and forest is a well-known treasure for New Jersey trout fishermen. It is regularly restocked by the state fisheries service.
The center of Califon is the historic iron bridge spanning the South Branch of the Raritan River, which divides the borough. Recently the State of New Jersey announced that the bridge would be replaced because a loaded school bus represented more weight than the aging bridge could safely carry. Incensed citizens objected, protective of the landmark, and found a colorful but simple solution; the school bus stops at one end of the bridge unloading the students, who then walk across to the other side. Then the empty bus, within imposed weight limits, drives across and the students get back on the bus to continue their ride. Thus the bridge was saved. (Account featured on Califon website).

The 1943 short story, &quot;The Greatest Gift,&quot; was set in a town inspired by Califon and adapted into the 1946 classic film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life.&quot; Author Philip Van Doren Stern said in a 1946 interview, &quot;Incidentally, the movie takes place in Westchester County. Actually, the town I had in mind was Califon, N.J.&quot; The historic iron bridge in Califon is similar to the bridge that George Bailey considered jumping from in the movie.

Califon became a regional household name when frequently mentioned by Merv Griffin on his TV show during the 1970s. He and his wife Juliette owned a home in nearby Lebanon Township, which had a Califon mailing address, and, while they were married, they were often seen visiting the village in a fringed-top Bermuda-style resort cart, though they lived over 2 miles away. Califon Productions created all of his television ventures.

Hoffman&#x27;s Crossing was named for Issac Hoffman, who farmed land that lies just south of Califon Bridge, along present day County Route 513.

==Historic district==

The Califon Historic District is a historic district encompassing much of the borough. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 14, 1976, for its significance in commerce. The district includes 154 contributing buildings, three contributing structures, and one contributing site. It was created through the efforts of the Califon Historical Society. Califon is a Victorian-style enclave where the houses are marked with the names of the builders and their dates of establishment rather than with street numbers.

The Joseph Tiger House was built of stone in 1846. A stone raceway runs under the former Beatty&#x27;s Store, indicating a possible mill site. The mid-19th century house at 1 First Street features a gable roof with an intersecting dormer. The Califon Main Street Bridge is a Pratt thru truss design built in 1887 by I. P. Bartley &amp; Co. of Morris County.

<text>Clinton is a town in Hunterdon County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located on the South Branch of the Raritan River in the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 2,773, an increase of 54 (+2.0%) from the 2010 census count of 2,719, which in turn reflected an increase of 87 (+3.3%) from the 2,632 counted in the 2000 census. Despite its relatively small population, Clinton is the predominant control city for Interstate 78 traveling westbound from Newark.

==History==
When the Clinton post office was established in 1829, it was named for DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York and the primary impetus behind the then-newly completed Erie Canal.

Clinton was incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 5, 1865, within portions of Clinton, Franklin and Union Townships. Clinton gained full independence from its three parent townships in 1895.

The town is perhaps best known for its two mills which sit on opposite banks of the South Branch Raritan River. The Red Mill, with its historic village, dates back to 1810 with the development of a mill for wool processing. Across the river sits the Stone Mill, home of the Hunterdon Art Museum, located in a former gristmill that had been reconstructed in 1836 and operated continuously until 1952. In 1952, a group of local residents conceived of a plan to convert the historic building into an art museum, which is still in operation today.

On October 30, 1891, a major fire destroyed 23 buildings and 17 businesses on Main Street. This is known here as the Great Fire of 1891.

Described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1988 as having &quot;conquered the worst residential radon hotspot known in the United States&quot; which resulted from uranium in the limestone under sections of the town, Clinton and mayor-at-the-time Robert A. Nulman received state, national, and international attention for the town&#x27;s successful efforts to combat the radon using ventilation systems in affected homes.

The Clinton Historic District encompassing much of the town was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995 for its significance in architecture, commerce, engineering, industry and exploration/settlement. The district includes 270 contributing buildings.

In 1998, Republican Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll proposed to honor former president Ronald Reagan by changing the town&#x27;s name to Reagan, New Jersey, and renaming Clinton Township to Reagan Township.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 1.44 square miles (3.72 km2), including 1.35 square miles (3.49 km2) of land and 0.09 square miles (0.24 km2) of water (6.39%).

The town borders the Hunterdon County municipalities of Clinton Township, Franklin Township and Union Township.

Clinton is considered an exurb of New York City, as Hunterdon County lies on the western fringe of the New York City Metropolitan Area, which is mainly rural with scattered housing developments and old farm homes. Clinton is part of the Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area of Middlesex, Somerset and Hunterdon counties in New Jersey. It serves as a bedroom community for many commuters working in and around Northern New Jersey and New York City, often younger residents who have supplanted long-time residents of Clinton.

===Climate===

Clinton falls under the North Jersey climate zone. According to the Office of the New Jersey State Climatologist at Rutgers University, the Northern climate zone covers about one-quarter of New Jersey and consists mainly of elevated highlands and valleys which are part of the Appalachian Uplands. Surrounded by land, this region can be characterized as having a continental climate with minimal influence from the Atlantic Ocean, except when the winds contain an easterly component. Prevailing winds are from the southwest in summer and from the northwest in winter. Being in the northernmost portion of the state, and with small mountains up to in elevation, the Northern Zone normally exhibits a colder temperature regime than other climate regions of the State of New Jersey. This difference is most dramatic in winter when average temperatures in the Northern Zone can be more than ten degrees Fahrenheit cooler than in the Coastal Zone. Annual snowfall averages in the northern zone as compared with an average of in the extreme south.

Clinton falls under the USDA 6b Plant Hardiness zone.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 2,719 people, 1,057 households, and 727 families in the town. The population density was 2,032.6 per square mile (784.8/km2).

<text>Berkhamsted ( ) is an historic market town in Hertfordshire, England, in the Bulbourne valley, north-west of London. The town is a civil parish with a town council within the borough of Dacorum which is based in the neighbouring large new town of Hemel Hempstead. Berkhamsted, along with the adjoining village of Northchurch, is encircled by countryside, much of it in the Chiltern Hills which is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

The High Street is on a pre-Roman route known by its Saxon name: Akeman Street. The earliest written reference to Berkhamsted was in 970. The settlement was recorded as a &quot;burbium&quot; (ancient borough) in the Domesday Book in 1086. The most notable event in the town&#x27;s history occurred in December 1066. After William the Conqueror defeated King Harold&#x27;s Anglo-Saxon army at the Battle of Hastings, the Anglo-Saxon leadership surrendered to the Norman encampment at Berkhamsted. The event was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. From 1066 to 1495, Berkhamsted Castle was a favoured residence of royalty and notable historical figures, including King Henry II, Edward, the Black Prince, Thomas Becket and Geoffrey Chaucer. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the town was a wool trading town, with a thriving local market. The oldest-known extant jettied timber-framed building in Great Britain, built between 1277 and 1297, survives as a shop on the town&#x27;s high street.

After the castle was abandoned in 1495, the town went into decline, losing its borough status in the second half of the 17th century. Colonel Daniel Axtell, captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the trial and execution of King Charles I in 1649, was among those born in Berkhamsted. Modern Berkhamsted began to expand after the canal and the railway were built in the 19th century. In the 21st century, Berkhamsted has evolved into an affluent commuter town.

The town&#x27;s literary connections include the 17th-century hymnist and poet William Cowper, the 18th-century writer Maria Edgeworth and the 20th-century novelist Graham Greene. Arts institutions in the town include The Rex (a well regarded independent cinema) and the British Film Institute&#x27;s BFI National Archive at King&#x27;s Hill, which is one of the largest film and television archives in the world. Schools in the town include Berkhamsted School, a co-educational boarding independent school (founded in 1541 by John Incent, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral); Ashlyns School a state school, whose history began as the Foundling Hospital established in London by Thomas Coram in 1742; and Ashridge Executive Education, a business school offering degree level courses, which occupies the Grade I listed neo-Gothic Ashridge House.

==History==
===Origin of the town&#x27;s name===

The earliest recorded spelling of the town&#x27;s name is the 10th century Anglo-Saxon &quot;Beorhðanstædæ&quot;. The first part may have originated from either the Old English words &quot;beorg&quot;, meaning &quot;hill&quot;, or &quot;berc&quot; or &quot;beorc&quot;, meaning &quot;birch&quot;; or from the older Old Celtic word &quot;Bearroc&quot;, meaning &quot;hilly place&quot;. The latter part, &quot;hamsted&quot;, derives from the Old English word for homestead. So the town&#x27;s name could be either mean &quot;homestead amongst the hills&quot; or the &quot;homestead among the birches&quot;.

Through history spellings of the town&#x27;s name have changed. Local historian Rev John Wolstenholme Cobb identified over 50 different versions of the town&#x27;s name since the writing of the Domesday Book (such as: &quot;Berkstead&quot;, &quot;Berkampsted&quot;, &quot;Berkhampstead&quot;, &quot;Muche Barkhamstede&quot;, &quot;Berkhamsted Magna&quot;, &quot;Great Berkhamsteed&quot; and &quot;Berkhamstead&quot;.) The present spelling was officially adopted in 1937 when the local council formally changed its name from Great Berkhampstead to Berkhamsted. The town&#x27;s local nickname is &quot;Berko&quot;.

===Prehistory and Roman period===

 Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman artefacts show that the Berkhamsted area of the Bulbourne Valley has been settled for over 5,000 years. The discovery of a large number of worked flint chips provides Neolithic evidence of on-site flint knapping in the centre of Berkhamsted. Several settlements dating from the Neolithic to the Iron Age (about 4500–100 BC) have been discovered south of Berkhamsted. Three sections of a late Bronze Age to Iron Age (1200–100 BC) bank and ditch, wide by high and known as Grim&#x27;s Ditch, are found on the south side of the Bulbourne Valley. Another Iron Age dyke with the same name is on Berkhamsted Common, on the north side of the valley.

In the late Iron Age, before the Roman occupation, the valley would have been within Catuvellauni territory. The Bulbourne Valley was rich in timber and iron ore. In the late Iron Age, a area around Northchurch became a major iron production centre, now considered to be one of the most important late Iron Age and Roman industrial areas in England. Iron production led to the settlement of a Roman town at Cow Roast, about northwest of Berkhamsted. Four Roman first century AD iron smelting bloomeries at Dellfield ( northwest of the town centre) provide evidence of industrial activity in Berkhamsted. Production ceased at the end of the Roman period. Other evidence of Roman-British occupation and activity in the Berkhamsted area, includes a pottery kiln on Bridgewater Road. The town&#x27;s high street still follows the line of the Roman-engineered Akeman Street, which had been a pre-existing route from St Albans (&quot;Verulamium&quot;) to Cirencester (&quot;Corinium&quot;).

During Roman occupation the countryside close to Verulamium was subdivided into a series of farming estates. The Berkhamsted area appears to have been divided into two or three farming estates, each including one or more masonry villa buildings, with tiled roofs and underfloor heating.
*The remains of a villa were found close to the river in 1973 in the adjacent village of Northchurch. The oldest building, made of timber, was built in AD 60, rebuilt using stone in the early 2nd century, and enlarged to a ten-room building around AD 150. The house may have been empty for a period, reoccupied in the 4th century, and abandoned in the late 4th or early 5th century.
*A Roman-British villa, dyke, and temple were found NNW of the castle, near Frithesden, at the edge of the Berkhamsted Golf Course. Excavations in 1954 revealed masonry foundations and tesserae floors. Together, the villa, dyke and temple form a unique complex, suggesting occupation in the late Iron Age and Roman period.
*Two flint and tile walls from a Roman building were found north of Berkhamsted Castle in 1970. The construction of the castle&#x27;s earthworks in the Middle Ages may have damaged this building.

===Anglo-Saxon settlement===

The earliest written reference to Berkhamsted is in the will of Ælfgifu (died AD 970), queen consort of King Eadwig of England (r. 955–959), who bequeathed large estates in five counties, including Berkhamsted. The location and extent of early Saxon settlement of Berkhamsted is not clear. Rare Anglo-Saxon pottery dating from the 7th century onwards has been found between Chesham Road and St John&#x27;s Well Lane, with water mills near Mill Street in use from the late 9th century, show that an Anglo-Saxon settlement existed in the centre of modern-day Berkhamsted. The nearest known structural evidence of the Anglo-Saxon period are in the south and west walls of St Mary&#x27;s Northchurch, to the north-west of modern Berkhamsted. The church may have been an important minster, attached to a high status Anglo-Saxon estate, which became part of the medieval manor of Berkhamsted after the Norman conquest.

The parish of Berkhamsted St Mary&#x27;s (in Northchurch) once stretched from the hamlet of Dudswell, through Northchurch and Berkhamsted to the former hamlet of Bourne End. Within Berkhamsted, the Chapel of St James was a small church near St John&#x27;s Well (a &#x27;holy well&#x27; that was the town&#x27;s principal source of drinking water in the Middle Ages). The parish of this church (and later that of St Peter&#x27;s) was an enclave of about surrounded by Berkhamsted St Mary&#x27;s parish. By the 14th century the adjoining village of &quot;Berkhamsted St Mary&quot; or &quot;Berkhamsted Minor&quot; name had become &quot;North Church&quot;, later &quot;Northchurch&quot;, to distinguish the village from the town of Berkhamsted.

===1066 and the Domesday survey===

The Anglo-Saxons surrendered the crown of England to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted in early December 1066. After William defeated and killed Harold II at the Battle of Hastings in October, he failed in an attempt to capture London from the south. William led his army around London, crossing the River Thames at Wallingford, &quot;laying waste&quot; while travelling through southeast England. At Berkhamsted, he received the surrender of Edgar the Ætheling (heir to the English throne), Archbishop Ealdred, Earl Edwin, Earl Morcar and the leaders of London. It is not known why the town was chosen as the meeting place, except that it was in a defensive location north-west of London. William was crowned in Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day, 1066. After his coronation, William granted the &quot;Honour of Berkhamsted&quot; to his half-brother, Robert, Count of Mortain, who after William became the largest landholder in the country. Robert built a wooden fortification that later became a royal retreat for the monarchs of the Norman and Plantagenet dynasties.

According to the Domesday Book, the lord of Berkhamsted before the Norman conquest was Edmer Ator (also referred to as Eadmer Atule), thegn of Edward the Confessor and King Harold. The Domesday survey records that there was enough land for 26 plough teams, but only 15 working teams. There were two flour mills (Upper and Lower Mill), woodland for 1,000 pigs, and a vineyard. The total population was calculated to be either 37 or 88 households; the families included 14 villagers, 15 smallholders, 6 slaves, a priest, a dyke builder (possibly working on the earthworks of the castle) and 52 burgesses. Some historians have argued that the number of 52 burgesses in Berkhamsted was a clerical error, as it is a large number for a small town. Berkhamsted was described in the Domesday Book as a &quot;burbium&quot; (ancient borough) in the Tring Hundred.() Marjorie Chibnall argued that Robert, Count of Mortain intended Berkhamsted to be both a commercial and a defensive centre; while John Hatcher and Edward Miller believed that the 52 burgesses were involved in trade, but it is unknown if the burgesses existed before the conquest.

===Royal medieval castle (11th to 15th centuries)===

Berkhamsted Castle is a (now ruined) motte-and-bailey Norman castle. Radiocarbon dating of organic remains from within the motte indicates that it was probably built post-1066 (a dyke builder is recorded in the town at the time of the Domesday Book). The castle was a high-status residence and an administrative centre for large estates (including the Earldom of Cornwall). Through the High and Late Middle Ages the close proximity of the royal castle and court helped fuel Berkhamsted&#x27;s growth, prosperity and sense of importance. It created jobs for the local population, both within the castle itself and also, for example, in the large deer park and in the vineyard, which were maintained alongside the castle.

After Robert, Count of Mortain, the castle passed to his heir William, who rebelled against Henry I and lost the castle to the king. In 1155 Henry in turn gave it to his favourite Thomas Becket, who held it till 1165. Becket was later alleged to have spent over £300 on improvements to the castle, a claim that led Henry to accuse him of corruption and may have contributed to his downfall. Henry II extensively used the castle, making it one of his favourite residences. Both King Richard I and King John gave the castle to their queens, Berengaria of Navarre and Isabella of Angoulême, respectively. In King John&#x27;s reign, Geoffrey Fitz Peter (c. 1162–1213), Earl of Essex and the Chief Justiciar of England (effectively the king&#x27;s principal minister) held the Honour and Manor of Berkhamsted from 1199 to 1212. During his time in the castle he was responsible for the foundation of the new parish church of St Peter (the size of which reflects the growing prosperity of the town); two hospitals, St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist (one of which was a leper hospital), which survived until 1516; and for the layout of the town.

Following the signing of Magna Carta (1215), King John&#x27;s reneging on the royal charter, the castle was besieged during the ensuing civil war, known as the First Barons&#x27; War, between John and barons supported by Prince Louis (the future Louis VIII of France), the French laid siege to Berkhamsted Castle (only a quarter of a mile from the town centre) in late December 1216. The queen&#x27;s constable of the castle was the German Walerand Teutonicus.
After reducing the castle of Hertford, Louis marched on St Nicholas&#x27;s day (6 December) to the castle of Berkhamsted and surrounded it with his engines of war. Whilst the English barons, after pitching their tents, were employed in setting them in order, the knights and soldiers of the garrison made a sally, seized the baggage and conveyances of the barons and gained possession of the standard of William de Mandeville with which they returned to the castle, regretting that they could do no further injury to them. On the same day, whilst the barons were sitting at table, the knights and soldiers of the garrison again made a sally, and, in order to put the barons in confusion, they carried before them the standard which they had taken a short time before, and thought to come on them unawares, but the latter were forewarned of this, and drove them back to the castle. When the following day dawned Louis ordered the petrarie (stone-throwing machines) and other engines of war to be erected around the city, which being done, they kept up a destructive shower of stones: but Waleran, a German, well tried in warfare, made a brave resistance against them and caused great slaughter amongst the excommunicated French.—The contemporary chronicler, Roger of Wendover, based at St Albans abbey, 12 miles from Berkhamsted, describing the siege

During the siege, Prince Louis introduced a new destructive siege engine to England at Berkhamsted, the counterweight &quot;trebuchet&quot; (or &quot;mangonel)&quot;. After a siege of twenty days the young new King (Henry III) ordered his constable to surrender the castle to Louis on 20 December. Following the siege at Berkhamsted Louis suffered several defeats. 11 September 1217 Louis signed the Treaty of Lambeth, relinquishing his claim to the English throne and surrendering French-held castles including Berkhamsted. Walerand went on to hold several other posts including the senior position of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

In 1227, Henry III&#x27;s younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, was given the manor and castle, beginning the long association of the castle with the Earls and later the Dukes of Cornwall. Richard redeveloped the castle as a palatial residence and the centre for the administration of the Earldom of Cornwall. Richard&#x27;s coat of arms as Earl of Cornwall, along with bezants, is included in Berkhamsted&#x27;s coat of arms. Richard&#x27;s wife, Sanchia of Provence, died in the castle in 1260. Richard was succeeded by his son, Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who founded Ashridge Priory, a college of the monastic order of Bonhommes, in 1283. In 1300, after Edmund died, Edward I took the castle; he subsequently granted it to his second queen, Margaret of France. In 1309, Edward I&#x27;s and Margaret&#x27;s son, Edward II, granted Berkhamsted to his favourite, Piers Gaveston. In 1317, the castle was given to Edward II&#x27;s queen, Isabella of France.

Edward III further developed the castle and gave it (as part of the Duchy of Cornwall) to his son, Edward, the Black Prince, who expanded the hunting grounds. The castle was used to hold royal prisoners, including John II of France. In 1361, Edward the Black Prince and Joan, the Maid of Kent, spent their honeymoon in Berkhamsted. Under Edward the Black Prince, Berkhamsted become a centre of English longbow archery. A decisive factor in the English victory at the Battle of Crécy (1346) was the introduction of this new weapon onto the Western European battlefield. The longbow was a superior weapon to the cumbersome and slower crossbow. The Berkhamsted bowmen successfully took part in this significant battle in medieval Western European history. The Black Prince was supported at the Battle of Crecy by local bowmen Everard Halsey, John Wood, Stephen of Champneys, Robert Whittingham, Edward le Bourne, Richard of Gaddesden and Henry of Berkhamsted (who was rewarded with 2d a day and appointed porter of Berkhamsted Castle after he saved the prince&#x27;s baggage at the Battle of Poitiers). Richard II inherited Berkhamsted Castle in 1377 and gave it to his favourites, Robert de Vere and John Holland.

In 1400, Henry IV lived in the castle after he deposed Richard, and he used the castle to imprison others attempting to obtain the throne. During this time, Geoffrey Chaucer – later famous for writing &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; – oversaw renovation work on the castle in his role as Clerk of the Works at Berkhamsted. It is unknown how much time he spent at Berkhamsted, but he knew John of Gaddesden, who lived in nearby Little Gaddesden and was the model for the Doctor of Phisick in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. Henry V and Henry VI owned the castle, the latter making use of it until he was overthrown in 1461. In 1469, Edward IV gave the castle to his mother, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York. The arrival of Neville and her household at Berkhamsted had a significant social and financial impact on the town. Men and women from the town joined her service, such as Robert Incent who became her secretary and whose memorial brass can still be seen in St Peter&#x27;s Church in Berkhamsted. Mother to both Edward IV and Richard III, grandmother to Edward V, and mother in law to Henry VII, she was the last person to live in the castle.

====Recent history of the castle====
In 1833, the castle was the first building to receive statutory protection in the United Kingdom. In 1834, construction of the railway embankment demolished the castle&#x27;s gatehouse and adjacent earthworks. Today the castle ruins are managed by a charitable trust, the &quot;Berkhamsted Castle Trust&quot;, in partnership with English Heritage, on behalf of the Duchy of Cornwall (which still officially owns the site), and are freely open to the public.

===Medieval market town (12th to 15th centuries)===
The town continued to develop separately on the old Akeman Street to the south of the castle and to the west of St Peter&#x27;s Church; with a triangle formed by Mill Street, Castle Street and Back Lane pointing towards the castle. In 1156, Henry II officially recognised Berkhamsted as a town in a royal charter, which confirmed the laws and customs enjoyed under Edward the Confessor, William I and Henry I, and freed the town&#x27;s merchants from all tolls and dues. The charter also stated that no market could be set up within of the town.
The town became a trading centre on an important trade route in the 12th and 13th centuries, and received more royal charters. In 1216, Henry III relieved the men and merchants of the town from all tolls and taxes everywhere in England, and the English Plantagenet possessions in France, Normandy, Aquitaine and Anjou. The growing wool trade brought prosperity to Berkhamsted from the 12th century until the early Tudor period. Four wealthy Berkhamsted wool merchants were amongst a group in Bruges to whom Edward III wrote in 1332, and Berkhamsted merchants sold cloth to the royal court.

In 1217, Henry III recognised by royal charter the town&#x27;s oldest institution, Berkhamsted&#x27;s pre-existing market. Trades within medieval Berkhamsted were extensive: early in the 13th century the town had a merchant, two painters, a goldsmith, a forester, two farriers, two tailors, a brewer of mead, a blacksmith, carpenters, wood turners, tool makers, a manufacturer of roofing tiles and wine producers. In the mid–13th century, a banker, the wealthy Abraham of Berkhamsted, financier to the Earl of Cornwall, lived in the town; this was unusual for a small town in a time of heightened persecution of Jews.

A 1290 taxation list mentions a brewer, a lead burner, a carpenter, leather workers, a fuller, a turner, a butcher, a fishmonger, a barber, an archer, a tailor, a cloth-napper, a miller, a cook, a seller of salt and a huntsman. At this time, larger houses of merchants and castle officials appeared on the south side of the high street (including 173 High Street, the oldest known extant jettied building in England). In 1307 Berkhamsted was a large town by English medieval standards with an estimated population of 2,000 to 2,500. In 1355, there were five butchers, two bakers, nine brewers, two cobblers, a pelter, a tanner, five cloth dyers, six wheelwrights, three smiths, six grain merchants, a skinner and a baker/butcher. In the 14th century, Berkhamsted (recorded as &quot;Berchamstede&quot;) was considered to be one of the &quot;best&quot; market towns in the country. In a survey of 1357, Richard Clay was found to own a butcher&#x27;s shop wide, William Herewood had two shops, and there were four other shops in length. In 1440, there is a reference to lime kilns.

The town benefited when Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, founded Ashridge Priory in 1283, away and within the castle&#x27;s park. At the foundation of the abbey, the Earl donated a phial claimed to contain Christ&#x27;s blood. Pilgrims from all over Europe passed through the town to see the holy relic. The abbey grew quite wealthy as a result. Edward I held parliament at the abbey in 1290 and spent Christmas there. Berkhamsted burgesses sent two members to parliament in 1320, 1338 and 1341, but the town was not represented again. In the mid-14th century, the Black Prince took advantage of the Black Death to extend the castle&#x27;s park by , eventually producing a park covering . In the 15th century, the town was reaffirmed as a borough by a royal charter granted by Edward IV (1442–1483), which decreed that no other market town was to be set up within .

===Castle abandoned, the town in decline (16th to late 18th centuries)===
In the 16th century, the town fell into decline after abandonment of the castle following the death of Cicely Neville, Duchess of York, in 1495, and the rise of the nearby town of Hemel Hempstead (which was granted a Charter of Incorporation by Henry VIII on 29 December 1539). The population of the town in 1563 has been estimated at only 545. In 1580, the castle ruins and the park were leased by Elizabeth I to Sir Edward Carey, for the nominal rent of one red rose each year. Stone from the castle was used to build Berkhamsted Place, a local school, and other buildings in the late 16th century. Brewing and maltings was noted as one of the town&#x27;s principal industries in the reign of Elizabeth. Around 1583, a new market house was erected west of St Peter&#x27;s Church at the end of Middle Row (alternatively named Le Shopperowe or Graball Row). The market house was destroyed in a fire in 1854.

In 1612, Berkhamsted Place was bought by Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales for £4,000. Henry died later that year, and bequeathed the house to his brother Charles (later King Charles I), who leased the property to his tutor, Thomas Murray, and his wife, Mary Murray, who had been his nurse and Lady of the Privy Chamber to the prince&#x27;s mother. John Norden wrote in 1616 that the making of malt was then the principal trade of the town. In 1618, James I reaffirmed Berkhamsted&#x27;s borough status with a charter. Following surveys in 1607 and 1612 the Duchy of Cornwall enclosed from the Common (now known as Coldharbour farm) despite local opposition led by Rev Thomas Newman. In 1639 the Duchy tried to enclose a further of the Berkhamsted and Northchurch Commons, but was prevented from doing so by William Edlyn of Norcott. The castle&#x27;s park, which had reached by 1627, was broken up over the next two decades, shrinking to only , to the benefit of local farmers. In 1643, Berkhamsted was visited by a violent pestilential fever.

Born in Berkhamsted, Colonel Daniel Axtell (1622 – 19 October 1660), a Baptist and a grocer&#x27;s apprentice, played a zealous and prominent part in the English Civil War, both in England and in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. He participated as a lieutenant colonel in Pride&#x27;s Purge of the Long Parliament (December 1648), arguably the only military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in English history, and commanded the Parliamentary Guard at the trial of King Charles I at Westminster Hall in 1649. During Cromwell&#x27;s Protectorate, he appropriated Berkhamsted Place. Shortly after the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, the unrepentant Axtell was hanged, drawn and quartered as a regicide. After the Restoration, the town lost its charter granted by James I and its borough status. The surveyor of Hertfordshire recommended that a new tenant and army officers were needed at Berkhamsted Place &quot;to govern the people much seduced of late by new doctrine preacht unto them by Axtell and his colleagues.&quot; The population of the town in 1640 and in the 1690s was estimated at 1075 and 767, respectively. The town was a centre of religious nonconformity from the 17th century: over a quarter of the town were Dissenters in the second half of the century, and in 1700, there were 400 Baptists recorded as living in Berkhamsted. Three more shops are mentioned in the row next to the church, and the Parliamentary Survey of 1653 suggests that the area near the Market House was used for butchery.

===Development of the modern town (19th and 20th centuries)===

====19th century urban growth====

In the 17th and 18th centuries Hemel Hempstead, with its thriving market, eclipsed Berkhamsted as the major town in the area. Georgian Berkhamsted barely extended beyond the medieval triangle and the High Street. With the coming of the Industrial Age, Berkhamsted was well placed at a gateway through the Chilterns, between the markets of London and the industrial Midlands. The town became a link in the growing network of roads, canals and railways. These developments led Berkhamsted&#x27;s population to expand once again. In 1801, the population of St Peter&#x27;s parish had been 1,690 and by 1831, this had risen to 2,369 (484 houses). An 1835 description of the town found that &quot;the houses are mostly of brick, and irregularly built, but are interspersed with a fair proportion of handsome residences&quot;. The town&#x27;s population increased as &quot;hundreds of men arrived to build the railway line and needed lodging&quot;; by 1851, the population was 3,395, From 1850 large estates around Berkhamsted were sold, allowing for housing expansion. In 1851 the Pilkington Manor estate, east of Castle Street, was sold, and the land developed both as an industrial area and for artisans&#x27; dwellings. In 1868 streets of middle-class villas began to appear on the hill south of the High Street. Lower Kings Road was built by public subscription in 1885 to join Kings Road and the High Street to the station. In 1887, John Bartholomew&#x27;s &quot;Gazetteer of the British Isles&quot; recorded the population at 4,485.

====19th century industry and utilities====
Industries in the 19th century included:
*&quot;Timber:&quot; In the mid-18th century, Berkhamsted had been noted for turned wood products. Based on the extensive woodland resources of the area (principally alder and beech), the milling and turning of wood was the town&#x27;s most prominent industry in the 19th century. The Crimean War contracts for supplying the army with lance poles and tent pegs led to major expansion. The largest manufacturer was East &amp; Sons.
*&quot;Brush making:&quot; An offshoot of the timber industry. The largest employers were Goss Brushworks at the west end of the High Street (closed 1930s) and T.H. Nash in George Street (closed 1920s).
*&quot;The Canal trade&quot; provided a considerable economic stimulus to the town, enabling the development of industries which involved bulk transport of materials. These included timber and malt.
*&quot;Boat building:&quot; Berkhamsted also became a centre for the construction of the barges needed for the canal trades. A yard for building canal barges and other boats, between Castle Street and Raven&#x27;s Lane wharves, was one of three important boatyards in Hertfordshire. It was owned by John Hatton until 1880 and then by William Costin until 1910, when it was taken over by Key&#x27;s, the timber merchants which in 1969 was bought by another timber merchant J. Alsford before being redeveloped into flats in 1994. At this site, next to the canal, is the Berkhamsted Canadian totem pole. 
*&quot;Watercress:&quot; The construction of the canal had helped to drain the marshy areas along the valley of the River Bulbourne. In 1883, the &quot;Berkhamsted Times&quot; congratulated Mr Bedford on having converted the remaining &quot;dirty ditches and offensive marshes&quot; into watercress beds.
*&quot;Chemical:&quot; Cooper&#x27;s sheep dip works. William Cooper was a vet who arrived in Berkhamsted in the early 1840s and experimented in treatments for scab in sheep. He formulated an innovative arsenic and sulphur sheep-dip. The Cooper family firm was later inherited by his nephew, Sir Richard Cooper, 1st Baronet.
*&quot;Nurserymen:&quot; Henry Lane&#x27;s nurseryman business, founded in 1777, became one of the largest employers in the town in the 19th century. Extensive nurseries are shown on the 1878 Ordnance Survey 25 inch plan, at the western end of the town.
*&quot;Iron working:&quot; Wood&#x27;s Ironworks was set up in 1826 by James Wood.

Utilities in the 19th century included:
*&quot;Gasworks:&quot; The Great Berkhamsted Gas, Light &amp; Coke Co., at the junction of Water Lane and the Wilderness, was set up to provide street lighting in 1849. In 1906, the Berkhamsted Gas Works moved to Billet Lane; it closed in 1959.
*&quot;Water and sewage:&quot; The Great Berkhamsted Waterworks Company was set up in 1864 on the High Street (on the present site of W.H. Smith and Boots). Mains drainage was first supplied in 1898–99, when effective sewerage was installed.

====Provision for the destitute====

In 1725 &quot;An Account of Several Workhouses&quot; records a parish workhouse in Berkhamsted, and a parliamentary report of 1777 refers to a parish workhouse for up to 34 inmates in Northchurch. A small &quot;wretched, straw-thatched&quot; house was used to house poor families in Berkhamsted, on the corner of what is now Park View Road, until it was demolished in the 1820s. In 1831 a bequest of £1,000 by the Revd George Nugent led to a new parish workhouse being set up on the site of a workhouse which had operated in a row of tenements on the High Street (at the Kitsbury Road junction) known as Ragged Row. The &quot;Berkhampstead Poor Law Union&quot; was formed in June 1835 covering ten parishes centred on the town. The Union took over the existing Berkhamsted parish workhouse, and by August 1835 it had become the sole workhouse for the union. The workhouse had no schoolroom, so in 1849 the Poor Law Board recommended that pauper children be sent to the local National School. However in 1858 the school complained about the state of the children attending from the workhouse. A fever ward was erected in 1855, and a full-time nurse was engaged in 1868. The workhouse system officially came to an end in 1930, and control over the workhouse was given to local council. Nugent House, the Berkhamsted workhouse, finally closed in 1935 and its function was relocated to Hemel Hemspstead. In 1841, the Countess of Bridgewater built a soup kitchen for the local poor within the ruins of Berkhamsted Castle. The soup kitchen was used by an estimated 15 per cent of the population of Berkhamsted (about 500 people) during the winter months, until at least 1897. The building still stands connected to the cottage in the castle grounds; why it was placed outside the town and inside the ruins of the historic castle is unknown. 

====Land dispute: &quot;The Battle of Berkhamsted Common&quot;====

The &quot;Battle of Berkhamsted Common&quot; played an important part in the preservation of common land nationally. After 1604 the former Ashridge Priory became the home of the Edgerton family. In 1808–1814 Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, demolished the old priory, and built a stately home, Ashridge House. In 1848 the estate passed to the Earls Brownlow, a branch of the Egerton family.

In 1866, Lord Brownlow of Ashridge House (encouraged by his mother, Lady Marian Alford) in an action similar to many other large estate holders tried to enclose Berkhamsted Common with steel fences (built by Woods of Berkhamsted) in order to claim the land as part of his family&#x27;s estate. In response to the enclosure action and in defence the historic right of the public to use the ancient common land, Augustus Smith MP and George Shaw-Lefevre organised local people and 120 hired men from London&#x27;s East End to dismantle the fences on the night of 6 March, in what became known nationally as the Battle of Berkhamsted Common.

Lord Brownlow brought a legal case against Smith for trespass and criminal damage, Smith was aided in his defence by Sir Robert Hunter (later co-founder of the National Trust in 1895) and the Commons Preservation Society. Lord Justice Romilly determined that pulling down a fence was no more violent an act than erecting one. The case, he said, rested on the legality of Brownlow&#x27;s action in building the fence and the legal right of people to use the land. He ruled in favour of Smith. This decision, along with the Metropolitan Commons Act 1866, helped to ensure the protection of Berkhamsted Common and other open spaces nationally threatened with enclosure. In 1926 the common was acquired by the National Trust.

====First World War====

During the First World War, under the guidance of Lt Col Francis Errington, the Inns of Court Officers&#x27; Training Corps trained men from the legal profession as officers. Over the course of the war, 12,000 men travelled from Berkhamsted to fight on the Western Front. Their training included trench digging: of trenches were dug across the Common (of which remain). The Inns of Court War Memorial on the Common has the motto &quot;Salus Populi Suprema Lex&quot;—the welfare of the people is the highest law—and states that the ashes of Colonel Errington were buried nearby.

====20th century urban developments====

In 1909 Sunnyside and later in 1935 Northchurch were added to Berkhamsted Urban District. Shortly after 1918 much of the extensive estate belonging to Berkhamsted Hall, at the east end of the High Street, was sold; many acres west of Swing Gate Lane were developed with council housing. More council housing was built at Gossoms End. Development on the north side of the valley was limited until the sale of the Ashridge estate in the 1930s, after which housing appeared at each end of Bridgewater Road. In the second half of the 20th century, many of the old industrial firms in Berkhamsted closed, while the numbers of commuters increased.

After the Second World War, in July 1946, the nearby town of Hemel Hempstead was designated a New Town under the New Towns Act (&quot;New Towns&quot; were satellite urban developments around London to relieve London&#x27;s population growth and housing shortages caused by the Blitz). In February 1947 the Government purchased of land and began construction. As a result Hemel Hempstead&#x27;s population increased from 20,000 to over 90,000 today, making it the largest town in Hertfordshire. In 1974, the old hundred of Dacorum became the modern district of Dacorum formed under the Local Government Act 1972, based in Hemel Hempstead.

==Geography==

Berkhamsted is situated northwest of London within the Chiltern Hills, part of a system of chalk downlands throughout eastern and southern England, believed to have formed between 84 and 100 million years ago in the Cretaceous Period when the area was a chalk-depositing marine environment. The town is located in a narrow northwest to southeast valley falling from above sea level to . The valley is at the southernmost limit of the Pleistocene glaciation ice erosion throughout the Chiltern scarp, giving it a smooth rounded appearance, with alluvial soils in the valley bottom and chalk, clay and flint on the valley sides. In the early Mesolithic period (Middle Stone Age, mid to late 8th millennium BC), the local upland was mostly pine woodland and the low area of central Berkhamsted probably a grass-sedge fen. In the 6th Millennium BC the dense deciduous forest became well established. By the Mid to late 3rd millennium BC during the Neolithic period (the New Stone Age) human activity can be seen in wood clearances; the woodland being then dominated by lime trees, with alder trees growing on the flood plain. The River Bulbourne, a chalk stream, runs through the valley for in a southeast direction, starting at Dudswell and the adjoining village of Northchurch and running through Berkhamsted, Bourne End and Boxmoor, where it merges with the River Gade at Two Waters in Apsley, near Hemel Hempstead. Rich in eels and other fish, it was fast-moving and full, and prone to frequent localised flooding. The river created a marsh environment (at times referred to as an &#x27;unhealthy swamp&#x27;) in the centre of the valley. The river powered the watermills (recorded in 1086) and fed the three moats of the large Norman Motte and Bailey castle, that stands close to the centre of the town where a small dry combe joins the Bulbourne valley. 

The countryside surrounding the town includes parts of the Green Belt and the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Urban Nature Conservation Study (UNCS) recognises the town&#x27;s hinterland as a biodiversity resource. The hills gently rise to an undulating and open plateau, which has a mix of arable farmland, common land and mixed oak, ash and beech woodland. On the northeast side of town are the Berkhamsted and Northchurch commons, the largest in the Chilterns at , and forming a large arc running from Northchurch, through Frithsden and down to Potten End. Ownership of Berkhamsted Common is divided between the National Trust and Berkhamsted Golf Club. Beyond the common is the historic wooded parkland of Ashridge; once part of Berkhamsted Castle&#x27;s hunting park, it is now managed by the National Trust. Ashridge is part of the Chilterns Beechwood Special Area of Conservation (SAC), a nationally important nature conservation area, and is also designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Agriculture is more dominant to the south of the town; close to the Buckinghamshire border there are two former large country estates, Ashlyns and Rossway. The ancient woodland at Dickshills is also located here.

The layout of Berkhamsted&#x27;s centre is typical of a medieval market settlement: the linear High Street (aligned on the Akeman Street) forms the spine of the town (roughly aligned east–west), from which extend medieval burgage plots (to the north and south). The surviving burgage plot layout is the result of a comprehensive plan carried out at the beginning of the 13th century, most probably instigated by Geoffrey fitz Peter. The town centre slowly developed over the years and contains a wide variety of properties that date from the 13th century onwards. The modern town began to develop after the construction of the Grand Junction Canal in 1798. The canal intersects the river at numerous points, taking most of its water supply and helping to drain the valley. The locality became further urbanised when the London to Birmingham railway was built in 1836–37. The townscape was shaped by the Bulbourne valley, which rises on either side at its narrowest point; the residential area is elongated and follows the valley&#x27;s topography. The southwest side of the valley is more developed, with side streets running up the steep hillside; on the northeast side, the ground gently slopes down to the castle, railway, canal and small river, was less available for development. Today, Berkhamsted is an affluent, &quot;pleasant town tucked in a wooded fold in the Chiltern Hills&quot;; with a large section of the settlement protected as a conservation area.

===Neighbouring settlements===
Traveling on the high street away from the town, along the Bulbourne valley south-eastwards towards London, the A4251 road passes through the village of Bourne End and the large new town of Hemel Hempstead ( distant). To the south south-east is the large village of Bovingdon. Taking the A416 road south from Berkhamsted, along the Chiltern Hills into Buckinghamshire lies the nearby hamlet of Ashley Green and the fellow market towns of Chesham ( distant) and Amersham. Further southwest is the village of Great Missenden and to the west is the small market town of Wendover.

Along the A4251 and valley northwestwards is the adjoining village of Northchurch, and the hamlets of Dudswell and Cow Roast, the village of Wigginton and the small market town of Tring ( distant) and the county town of Buckinghamshire Aylesbury at ( distant). Following the Chiltern Hills northwards, to the north-northwest is the village of Aldbury; situated to the north of Berkhamsted are the villages of Ringshall and Little Gaddesden ( distant); finally located to the north-east of the town are the villages and hamlets of Potten End, Frithsden and Great Gaddesden. The nearest large settlements to the north of Berkhamsted are the Bedfordshire towns of Dunstable ( distant) and Luton (.

===Climate===
Like most of the United Kingdom, Berkhamsted has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;).
Near-real-time weather information can be retrieved from Berkhamsted Weather Station page on the Met Office Weather Observation website.

==Governance==
Berkhamsted is within the UK parliamentary constituency of Harpenden and Berkhamsted. Following the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Victoria Collins (Liberal Democrats) is the constituency&#x27;s current Member of Parliament (MP).

Berkhamsted has a town council, the first tier of local government that represents the local people to two higher tiers of local government, Dacorum Borough Council and Hertfordshire County Council. The modern district of Dacorum based in Hemel Hempstead was formed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972; the local government district&#x27;s main population centres include Hemel Hempstead, Tring and the western part of Kings Langley. Berkhamsted accounts for just over 12 per cent of the district&#x27;s population of 153,300 in 2017.

Berkhamsted is split into three local government Wards—East, West and Castle. In the 2019 town council elections the political composition of the council was Liberal Democrat 10; Conservative 3; Green 2 . Following the 2023 town council elections the political composition of the council changed to Liberal Democrat 11; Green 2; Labour 2. In the 2021 local elections on 6 May, the Berkhamsted seat at Hertfordshire County Council was won with 51.8 per cent of the vote by the Liberal Democrat Nigel Taylor, compared to the Conservative vote of 29.8per cent.

===Administrative history===
Berkhamsted was an ancient borough, but lost this status in the seventeenth century. The town was then governed by its parish vestry until the nineteenth century, in the same way as most rural areas. In 1835 Berkhamsted was made the centre of a poor law union which covered the town and the surrounding parts of western Hertfordshire, as well as parts of Buckinghamshire. Under the Public Health Act 1872, sanitary districts were created, and the boards of guardians of poor law unions were made responsible for public health and local government for any part of their district not included in an urban authority. As Berkhamsted had no local board or other urban authority, it was therefore included in the rural sanitary district.

In 1893 the town petitioned for the creation of a local board covering both Berkhamsted and Northchurch parishes, which would make it independent of the rural sanitary authority. An inquiry was held by a government inspector in December 1893, but he advised against the scheme. Hertfordshire County Council therefore did not pursue it, although did comment that an urban authority covering just the town itself rather than the two whole parishes might be more favourably received.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, rural sanitary districts became rural districts on 28 December 1894, and so the town became part of the Berkhampstead Rural District. Parish councils were also established under the act, to take over the civil functions of the old vestries. The new parish councils came into being on 31 December 1894 if an election had been needed to choose the first parish councillors, as was the case at Berkhamsted. The first meeting of the parish council was held on 31 December 1894 at the Town Hall in Berkhamsted, with the first chairman of the parish council being Arthur Johnson, who was the rector of St Peter&#x27;s Church in the town.

===Berkhamsted Urban District (18981974)===
Efforts to make the town independent of the rural district council continued. Eventually it was agreed that the parish would be split into a &quot;Great Berkhampstead Urban&quot; parish, which would become an urban district, and a &quot;Great Berkhampstead Rural&quot; parish, which would remain in the Berkhampstead Rural District. These changes came into force on 15 April 1898. The first meeting of the Great Berkhampstead Urban District Council was held on 15 April 1898, with David Osborn being elected the council&#x27;s first chairman. The Great Berkhampstead Rural parish ceded land to the urban district in 1935 and was abolished two years later, being split between Nettleden with Potten End, Northchurch, and Great Gaddesden on 1 April 1937.

In 1908 the urban district council acquired a builder&#x27;s yard and former Wesleyan chapel at 135 High Street (renumbered 161 High Street around 1950) to act as its offices and meeting place. By the 1930s the council needed more space. In 1936 the council bought the shop adjoining the old chapel. Both buildings were demolished and the new Berkhamsted Civic Centre was built on the site, which formally opened on 14 October 1938.

Until 1937 the official name of the council&#x27;s area was the &quot;Great Berkhampstead Urban District&quot;. At a meeting on 15 April 1937 the council discussed whether to change the name. It was commented that the inclusion of the &quot;Great&quot; in particular caused problems for people looking for the council&#x27;s telephone number in the directory. The spelling &quot;Berkhamsted&quot; was also the more commonly used by this time. The change of name to &quot;Berkhamsted Urban District&quot; was agreed, and came into effect on 19 July 1937. The neighbouring Berkhampstead Rural District followed suit a few months later, becoming Berkhamsted Rural District on 1 November 1937.

Berkhamsted Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the district of Dacorum on 1 April 1974. Berkhamsted Town Council was created as a successor parish to the old urban district council. The town council continues to be based at the Civic Centre at 161 High Street.

The Hertfordshire Local Information System (HertsLIS) website (based on data from the Office for National Statistics and other UK government departments) has the following data regarding the 7,363 households in Berkhamsted in 2011. 72 per cent of homes were owner occupied (34 per cent owned outright and 38 per cent owned with a mortgage) compared to 63 per cent for England. 26.5 per cent of homes were rented (13 per cent each for social rented and private rented) compared to a national figure of 34.5 per cent. In 2011, 77 per cent of household spaces in Berkhamsted were houses or bungalows and 23 per cent were flats or maisonettes. 30 per cent of houses and bungalows were detached compared to 22 per cent nationally: 47 per cent of dwellings are semi-detached or terraced, compared to 55 per cent nationally. According to HertsLIS in the third quarter of 2017 the average price of houses and flats in Berkhamsted was £724,900, compared to £474,400 for Hertfordshire, and £304,500 for England. Detached houses were £1,070,600 compared to £424,400 nationally. Berkhamsted was shown as the best place to live in southeast England in the Sunday Times &#x27;Best Places to Live 2018&#x27; list, with the average prices of different types of homes in Berkhamsted ranging from £273,760 for starter homes to £999,920 for family homes, with rents from £850 to £2,490 per calendar month.

Overall, in 2021 property house prices in Berkhamsted were four per cent up on the previous year and five per cent up on the 2018 peak of £661,336.

===Employment and economic wellbeing===
In mid-2016, the Office for National Statistics estimated the working age population of Berkhamsted (males and females aged 16 to 64) as 11,400, i.e. 62 per cent of the town&#x27;s population. People from Berkhamsted were employed as follows: 17.5 per cent worked as managers, directors and senior officials; 27.5 per cent professional occupations and 8.5 per cent in associate professional and technical occupations; 10 per cent were employed in administrative and secretarial occupations; 7 per cent in skilled trades; 6 per cent Caring, leisure and other service occupations; 5 per cent were in sales and customer service occupations; 3 per cent were in process, plant and machine operatives; and 5.5 per cent worked in elementary occupations.

According to HertsLIS in 2011, 76 per cent of Berkhamsted residents between the ages of 16 and 74 were employed (of which: full-time, 43 per cent; part-time, 13 per cent; self-employed, 14 per cent); and 24 per cent economically inactive (retired, 13 per cent; long-term sick/disabled, 2 per cent). 1.5 per cent of Berkhamsted households included a person with a long-term health problem or disability, while nationally this figure is 4.05 per cent. In April 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics on benefit claimants by constituency, the number of claimants on Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance (unemployment benefit) in Berkhamsted&#x27;s South West Hertfordshire parliamentary constituency was 1.7 per cent, compared to 7.8 per cent for the UK.

===Diversity===
Looking at broad ethnic heritage in 2011, HertsLIS data found that 90 per cent of residents were described as white British. Of the remainder, 1 per cent were Irish, 4 per cent were of other white origin, 1.7 per cent were described as mixed or multiple ethnic, 2.1 per cent were Asian or Asian British, 0.3 per cent were black African/Caribbean or black British and 0.3 per cent were Arab or any other ethnic group.

Looking at the qualifications table, 12 per cent of residents had no qualifications, 10 per cent reached level 1, 13 per cent achieved level 2, 2 per cent had apprenticeship qualifications, 10 per cent were level 3 and 49 per cent achieved level 4 or above. In 2018, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; found 76 per cent of young people went on to higher education.

==Transport==
===Road===
In 1762, this section of Akeman Street became part of the Sparrows Herne Turnpike Road, a main thoroughfare between London and Aylesbury; it was notorious for its rutted and pitted state, even after becoming a toll road. Many coaching inns thrived along its route, including, in Berkhamsted, the King&#x27;s Arms (where the exiled King Louis XVIII of France carried on a romance with Polly Page, the innkeeper&#x27;s daughter). The town&#x27;s historic high street is now the A4251. A bypass, originally proposed in the 1930s, was opened in 1993 and the main A41 road now passes south-west of Berkhamsted. A study of car ownership in Berkhamsted, Northchurch and Tring found that 43–45 per cent of households had two or more cars, compared to the county average of 40 per cent and the national average of 29 per cent. Conversely, the proportion of households who did not own a car was 14–20 per cent (about 7 per cent lower than the national average). Local bus routes passing through Berkhamsted town centre provide links to Hemel Hempstead, Luton, Watford and Whipsnade Zoo. Services include the 30, 31, 62, 207, 500 (Aylesbury and Watford), 501, 502 and 532. Buses are managed by Hertfordshire County Council&#x27;s &quot;Intalink&quot; transport service.

===Canal===

In 1798, the Grand Junction Canal (built by William Jessop) from the River Thames at Brentford reached Berkhamsted; it reached Birmingham in 1805. Castle Wharf, the port of Berkhamsted, on the south side of the canal between Ravens Lane and Castle Street, was the centre of the town&#x27;s canal trade, navigation and boat building activities. It was a hub of the country&#x27;s inland water transport system, linking the ports and industrial centres of the country. Goods transported included coal, grain, building materials and manure. Timber yards, boating wharves, breweries, boat building and chemical works flourished as a result of the canal, with over 700 workers employed locally. It is still known as the &quot;Port of Berkhamsted&quot;. Separately, Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater (the &quot;Canal Duke&quot; and &quot;father of the inland waterway system&quot;), lived in Ashridge, near Berkhamsted. The canal became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929.

===Railway===

In 1834, after opposition from turnpike trusts and local landowners was resolved, the first Berkhamsted railway station was built by chief engineer Robert Stephenson. Though the castle was the first building to receive statutory protection from Parliament, the railway embankment obliterated the old castle barbican and adjacent earthworks. Most of the raw materials used to build the railway were transported by the canal. The present station was built in 1875 when the railway was widened. It is unusual, on its line, in that most of the original buildings have been retained. The &#x27;large trunk station&#x27; is located immediately next to Berkhamsted Castle on one side and overlooks the Grand Junction Canal on the other. The station is situated north-west of London Euston on the West Coast Main Line.&#x27;

One and a half million journeys are made annually to and from Berkhamsted, the vast majority by commuters to and from London. Principal services, operated by West Midlands Trains, run between London Euston and , with additional trains running to and . Southern also runs an hourly service direct to East Croydon, via .

==Economy and commerce==
In 1986, farming, service and light industry were characteristic local employers. In 2015, schools and retail (predominantly Waitrose) were the town&#x27;s largest employers; these are both situated in Berkhamsted Castle ward. The Berkhamsted West ward (especially around Billet Lane, close to the canal and railway) is where most of the town&#x27;s small to medium-sized industrial firms are located. The British Film Institute (BFI) is an important local employer to the south of Berkhamsted. As in many settlements, local industry has declined and more people commute elsewhere to work. Of the employed residents living in both Berkhamsted and Tring, 35 per cent live and work in the towns, while 65 per cent commute to workplaces away from the towns, particularly to London. Of the 7,100 people who work in Berkhamsted, 58 per cent commute to Berkhamsted to work. In 2011, 9.5 per cent of Berkhamsted residents (aged 16 to 74 in employment) worked mainly at or from home; 52 per cent drove to work by car (2.5 per cent as a passenger in a car); 22 per cent travelled by public transport; and 13 per cent cycled or walked to work. In 2011, an average commute to work was 21 kilometres.

In November 2014, the Academy of Urbanism&#x27;s &quot;Urbanism Awards&quot; found Berkhamsted&#x27;s High Street to be a &quot;vibrant&quot; and &quot;bustling&quot; road, which &quot;worked extremely well as a quality high street.&quot; They considered the layout for the street to be exemplary for its time (it was put in place after the bypass was built in the early 1990s), creating a &quot;pleasant&quot; and &quot;successful&quot; shopping environment and providing a good &quot;range of specialist shops and numerous cafes, restaurants and pubs&quot;, together with the &quot;strong supermarket&quot; offering set in &quot;well-crafted re-configured streetscape&quot;. The long high street had 100 per cent retail occupancy, independent traders and a &quot;cafe culture&quot;. The Academy considered the good working collaboration between individual businesses and the Chamber of Trade to be a particularly strong aspect of the street. In the &quot;2017 Vitality Index&quot; of 1000 retail locations in the UK carried out by Harper Dennis Hobbs, Berkhamsted was ranked as the 16th best shopping location in the country; in 2021, it ranked 9th. The index measured the quality of retail locations, including factors such as how well the retail mix met the needs of the local community, the number of vacant shops, and the proportion of &#x27;undesirable&#x27; shops such as pawnbrokers and bookmakers. Coming top in the south-east region in Sunday Times 2018 Best Places to Live, Berkhamsted was described as &quot;affluent and attractive; its medieval centre is filled with chic shops and great places to eat&quot;, with 76 per cent of shops being independent stores. Berkhamsted has an active Transition Town community.

==Education==
===Independent schools===
Berkhamsted School is a private public school. It was founded in 1541 by Dean John Incent, ( 1480–1545) Born in Berkhamsted &quot;circa&quot; 1480, John Incent was the Dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London from 1540 to 1545 (during the early years of the English Reformation).

Incent was noted as one of the agents of the Lord Chancellor Thomas Cromwell responsible for the sequestration of religious properties during the Dissolution of the Monasteries Incent financed the foundation of Berkhamsted school from the combined revenues of the town&#x27;s two medieval hospitals, St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, which he had closed down in 1516. In 1523 he took the lands of the two former hospitals and joined them to his own land, donating the enlarged estate towards the creation of a school. In 1541 he obtained a royal charter for &quot;one chauntry perpetual and schools for boys not exceeding 144 to be called Dean Incent&#x27;s Free School in Berkhamstedde&quot;. John Incent died intestate 18 months after his school opened. To protect the school from legal challenges, it was incorporated by an Act of Parliament as &quot;The Free Schole of King Edwarde the Sixte in Berkhampstedde&quot;. Amongst the school&#x27;s former students was the author Graham Greene. The school&#x27;s oldest building, the Old Hall, was built in 1544 and is Grade I listed. Contemporary records state that Incent &quot;builded with all speed a fair schoole lartge and great all of brick very sumptuously&quot;, and &quot;when ye said school was thus finished, ye Deane sent for ye cheafe men of ye towne into ye school where he kneeling gave thanks to Almighty God&quot;. In 1988, the school merged with Berkhamsted School for Girls (another large independent school in the town), which had been founded in 1888. The school has 1,500 fee-paying pupils, aged 3 to 18.

Egerton Rothesay School, an independent school founded in 1922, has 150 pupils between the ages of 5 and 19.

===State schools===

In the 1970s, the town adopted a three-tier state school education system, but reverted to the two-tier system of primary and secondary schools in 2013.

Primary schools are: Victoria (founded in 1838), Bridgewater, Greenway, St Thomas More, Swing Gate, Thomas Coram and Westfield. The secondary school is Ashlyns School, a Foundation school with 1,200 pupils aged 11 to 19 years; it is a specialist language college. The school started in the 18th century, when Thomas Coram, a philanthropic ship&#x27;s captain, was appalled by the abandoned babies and children starving and dying in London. He campaigned for a hospital to accommodate them and was successfully granted a royal charter &quot;for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Children&quot; in 1739. Three years later, in 1742, he established the Foundling Hospital at Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Fields in Bloomsbury, London. It was the first children&#x27;s charity in the country and a precedent for incorporated associational charities everywhere. The school moved to its purpose-built location in Berkhamsted in 1935. The residential home side at Berkhamsted closed following the Children Act 1948, when family-centred care replaced institutional care. In 1951 Hertfordshire County Council took over running the school. The large school contains stained glass windows, especially around the chapel, a staircase and many monuments from the original London hospital. The school&#x27;s chapel formerly housed an organ donated by George Frideric Handel. The school was used a backdrop to the 2007 comedy film, &quot;Son of Rambow&quot;.

===Business school===
 Hult Ashridge (formerly Ashridge Business School/Ashridge Executive Education) is located in the Grade I listed Ashridge House, the former stately home of the Duke of Bridgewater, set in of rolling parkland, two miles outside Berkhamsted. The house occupies the site of the earlier Ashridge Priory, a college of the monastic order of Bonhommes founded in 1283 by Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, who resided in the castle. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry VIII bequeathed the property to his daughter, Elizabeth. In 1800, it was the home of Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, affectionately known as the Father of Inland Navigation.Ashridge House was constructed between 1808 and 1814 to a design by James Wyatt with later work by his nephew Jeffrey Wyattville. Architecture critic Nikolaus Pevsner described it as the &quot;largest of the romantic palaces near London ... a spectacular composition&quot;. In 1928, Urban Hanlon Broughton purchased the house as a gift for the Conservative Party intended to commemorate former prime minister Andrew Bonar Law. For its first 15 years it was a &quot;College of Citizenship&quot;, established to help the party develop its intellectual forces in struggles with socialist organisations such as the Fabian Society. It became a cross between a think-tank and a training centre, with Arthur Bryant as its educational adviser.

In 2015, Ashridge merged with Hult International Business School, an American business school with campuses in seven cities around the world. Its activities include open and tailored executive education programmes, MBA, MSc and Diploma qualifications, organisation consulting, applied research and online learning. Ashridge is the only UK specialist business school with degree-awarding powers, giving it the equivalent status to a university in awarding its degrees.

==Religious sites==

The oldest extant church locally is St Mary&#x27;s in the adjacent village of Northchurch. Between 1087 and 1104, there is reference to a chaplain called Godfrey and to a chapel of St James with parochial status within St Mary&#x27;s Berkhamsted&#x27;s parish. The chapel situated close to St Johns, located close to St John&#x27;s Lane, was the base for a small community of monks, the Brotherhood of St John the Baptist, in the 11th and 12th centuries.

During King John&#x27;s reign, Geoffrey Fitz Peter, was instrumental in the foundation the parish church of St Peter, and in 1222, Robert de Tuardo, was registered as the first known rector. Because of the church&#x27;s proximity to the castle, the reigning monarch was patron of Berkhamsted rectors for several centuries. In 1648, St Peter&#x27;s Church was requisitioned during the English Civil War by General Fairfax as a military prison to hold soldiers captured from the siege of Colchester. The poet William Cowper was christened in St Peter&#x27;s, where his father John Cowper was rector.

The parish church of St Peter, which stands on the high street, is one of the largest churches in Hertfordshire. The church is in the Latin cross plan, with an clock tower at the crossing and measures from the west door to the east window, and the width across the transepts is . The oldest part of the church is the chancel, which is dated at c. 1200; it is in the Early English style common in that period. Further additions were made up until the 15th century; in 1871, it underwent a restoration by William Butterfield. There are two altar tombs with alabaster effigies dating from the 14th century: the tombs are of a knight (thought to be Henry of Berkhamsted, one of the Black Prince&#x27;s lieutenants at the Battle of Crecy) and his lady. There are two other Anglican churches in the town – &#x27;St Michael and All Angels&#x27; (Sunnyside)(original building 1886) and &#x27;All Saints&#x27; Church &amp; St Martha&#x27;s&#x27; (built in 1906, to cater for the growing population in the west end of the town). In 1842 a detached churchyard to St Peter&#x27;s Church was established, using land to the rear of Egerton House (where the Rex cinema now stands) on Rectory Lane. It expanded to 3.275 acres and was phased out of use in 1976.

The town has a strong Non-conformist tradition, in 1672 a survey found that there were 400 Anglian conformists and 150 Non-conformists in Berkhamsted, when such beliefs could bring you foul of the law. The Baptist community in Berkhamsted, dates from 1640 making it one of the oldest nationally; first gathering in secret, they built a large chapel in 1722, and moved to their current place of worship at the junction of Ravens Lane on the High Street in 1864. A Quaker community is present in the town from the second half of the 17th century, they opened their Meeting House in 1818 on the High Street opposite St John&#x27;s Well Lane. The Congregationlists can be traced back to 1780, they now worship combined with the Presbyterian church at St Andrew&#x27;s United Reformed Church on the corner of Castle Street and Chapel Street. The Methodists arrived with the hundreds of men who came to build the railway, via various places of worship, today they share All Saints&#x27; Church with the Anglians. The Evangelist (Latter Day Saints) began life has part of the Plymouth Brethren, their Hope Hall opened in 1875, which was rechristened the Kings Road Evangelical Church in 1969. The Roman Catholic tradition from the 17th to 20th century appears to be limited, General de Gaulle worshiped at their original Church of the Sacred Heart in Park View Road, they moved to a larger modern church in 1980 on Park Street.

==Culture and leisure==
===Literary connections===
Geoffrey Chaucer was clerk of works at Berkhamsted Castle from 1389 and based his Doctor of Phisick in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; on John of Gaddesden, who lived in nearby Little Gaddesden. William Cowper was born in Berkhamsted Rectory in 1731. Although he moved away when still a boy, there are frequent references to the town in his poems and letters. In the Victorian era, Cowper became a cult figure and Berkhamsted was a place of pilgrimage for his devotees. Maria Edgeworth, a prolific Anglo-Irish writer of adults&#x27; and children&#x27;s literature who was a significant figure in the evolution of the novel in Europe, lived in Berkhamsted as a child in the 18th century. Between 1904 and 1907, the Llewelyn Davies boys were the inspiration for the author and playwright J. M. Barrie&#x27;s Peter Pan. A little later, novelist Graham Greene was born in Berkhamsted and educated at Berkhamsted School, alongside literary contemporaries Claud Cockburn, Peter Quennell, Humphrey Trevelyan and Cecil Parrott. Children&#x27;s authors H. E. Todd and Hilda van Stockum both lived in Berkhamsted. The comic character Ed Reardon from Radio 4&#x27;s semi-naturalistic radio drama Ed Reardon&#x27;s Week resides in Berkhamsted.

===Cinema===

The Rex Cinema is regarded by some, including &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, as Britain&#x27;s most beautiful cinema. Described by Dame Judi Dench as &quot;absolutely awe-inspiring&quot;, the Rex was declared Britain&#x27;s Best Cinema in the inaugural &quot;Guardian&quot; film awards in 2014. Built in 1937, the Rex is recognised by English Heritage as a fine example of a 1930s art deco cinema. The cinema was designed by architect David Evelyn Nye for the Shipman and King circuit. Closed in 1988, the cinema was extensively restored in 2004 and has become a thriving independent local cinema. The Rex frequently has sold-out houses for evening showings, the cinema is a &quot;movie palace with all the original art deco trimmings&quot; (its interior features decorations of sea waves and shells). Inside is a step &quot;back into the golden age of film&quot; when going to the movies was an experience; the cinema features luxurious seating and two licensed bars. It is managed by its owner James Hannaway, who introduces films. Sometimes there is a question-and-answer session with directors and actors involved in the films; these sessions have included Dame Judi Dench, Charles Dance, Mike Leigh and Terry Jones.

Prior to the cinema&#x27;s construction, an Elizabethan mansion, Egerton House, had occupied the site at the east end of the high street for 350 years. The house was occupied briefly (1904–07) by Arthur and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, whose children were J. M. Barrie&#x27;s inspiration for Peter Pan.

===British Film Institute National Archive at King&#x27;s Hill===
Rarely open to the public, the BFI National Archive&#x27;s &quot;The J. Paul Getty, Jr. Conservation Centre&quot; in Berkhamsted is the archive of the British Film Institute. With over 275,000 feature, non-fiction and short films (dating from 1894) and 210,000 television programmes, it is one of the largest film archives in the world. Two of the archive&#x27;s collections were added to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) UK Memory of the World Register, in 2011. The archive collects, preserves, restores and shares the films and television programmes which have shaped and recorded British life and times since the development of motion picture film in the late 19th century. The majority of the collection is British-originated material, but the archive also features internationally significant holdings from around the world and films that feature key British actors and the work of British directors.

===Sport and outdoor pursuits===
The town benefits from having a large National Trust Common and woodland on its long north-east edge. Running east–west through the centre of the town, along the town&#x27;s length the Grand Union Canal (once an important trade artery) today it provides an open space with recreational opportunities, and acts with the small River Bulbourne as a wildlife corridor through the town. Other long standing public green spaces are the castle and Butts Meadow. In 2016 The Friends of St Peter&#x27;s Berkhamsted received £907,000 in a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund from the National Lottery (United Kingdom) to repurpose the Rectory Lane Cemetery - as one of 12 sites across the country sharing £32m. The grant is to restored heritage features and create a new green community space in the town.

The Berkhamsted Bowmen are the oldest archery club in England. Founded in 1875 Berkhamsted Cricket Club competes in the Herts League and in 2015 it ran twenty-five separate teams. The club is based at the Berkhamsted Community Cricket and Sports Club, Kitcheners Field, Castle Hill, Berkhamsted. The nine Berkhamsted and Hemel Hempstead Hockey Club teams are based just outside the town at Cow Roast, playing their matches on their astroturf pitch at the club grounds in Cow Roast. There are two Bowls clubs, Berkhamsted and Kitcheners.
The town&#x27;s football club, Berkhamsted FC, play in the Southern Football League Division One Central, part of the 8th Level in the English League (the town&#x27;s football ground is at Broadwater). The team was formed in 2009 after the demise of Berkhamsted Town FC, which had been established in 1895. Founded in 1996, Berkhamsted Raiders CFC football club was recognised as the FA Charter Standard Community Club of the Year at the English Football Association Community Awards in 2014 and awarded the UEFA Grassroots Silver Award in 2015 for their work across the local community. The club, in 2023, had more than 1,300 affiliated players, including 250 girls in 94 youth teams plus Senior, Veterans, Ladies, Walking Football and Inclusive Football sections. In 2022, the Club was awarded the Herts FA Grassroots Club of the Year.

There is a sports centre off Douglas Gardens, managed by EveryoneActive. The facilities comprise a large indoor multi-purpose sports hall, squash courts, swimming pool and outdoor all-weather pitch. This facility is complemented by dual use of the leisure facilities of Ashlyns School and Berkhamsted Collegiate School. A deficit in leisure space is compounded by a high level of sports participation locally and consequent heavy use of outdoor sports pitches. Berkhamsted and the surrounding area has a variety of road cycling and mountain biking routes, including traffic-free off-road routes in Ashridge Estate. The town was visited by the Tour of Britain in 2014.

==Media==
Berkhamsted is within the BBC London and ITV London region. Television signals are received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in Hemel Hempstead.

Local radio stations are BBC Three Counties Radio on 103.8 FM, Heart Hertfordshire on 96.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Bucks, Beds and Herts (formerly Mix 96.2) on 92.2 FM and community based stations, Radio Dacorum and Tring Radio, which both broadcast online. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, Hemel Hempstead Gazette &amp; Express.

==Sites of interest==
The majority of Berkhamsted&#x27;s eighty-five listed or scheduled historical sites are on in the high street and the medieval core of the town (a significant number of them contain timber frames). Four are scheduled, one is Grade I, seven are Grade II*, the remaining 75 are Grade II. In addition to the sites noted in the article above (such as the castle and schools) the following structures and locations are of interest:

* 173 High Street is a Victorian façade hiding what is considered to be the oldest extant jettied timber-framed building in Great Britain, dated by dendrochronology of structural timbers to between 1277 and 1297. The building was originally thought to have been a jeweller&#x27;s or goldsmith&#x27;s shop with a workshop behind. It is now believed to have been a jettied service wing to a larger aisled hall house, which has since disappeared. It represents an early example of transition in carpentry technology, from the use of passing braces to crown posts. The 13th-century origin of the structure was discovered by chance in 2000 by builders who had begun work on what appeared to be a Victorian property. The shop was, from 1869, Figg&#x27;s the Chemists; post-restoration (with expertise and a £250,000 grant from English Heritage), the shop is currently used as an estate agency. Dr Simon Thurley, Chief Executive of English Heritage, said &quot;This is an amazing discovery. It gives an extraordinary insight into how Berkhamsted High Street would have looked in medieval times.&quot;
* 125 High Street, a house and shop opposite St Peter&#x27;s Church, is a timber-framed building with a wing that is one bay of a 14th-century open hall. The layout suggests that it once had a second bay of similar size – a length of in all. This was an unusually large house; its size and central position suggests a manor house or other high status house, possibly supporting the castle. The building underwent extensive alterations in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.
* The Swan, 139 High Street, contains the remains of a medieval open hall. Parts of the roof date from the 14th century, and the street range was extended and a chimney stack added c. 1500. It sits on the ancient junction with the old Roman road of Akeman Street (High Street) and the main route between Berkhamsted and Windsor Castle (Chesham Road).
* Castle Street began life as the medieval lane from the town&#x27;s high street to the drawbridge of the royal castle. At the other end of the lane was the parish church of St Peters. In the 16th century, next to the church, Berkhamsted school was founded, while in the 17th century there were seven public houses among the street&#x27;s trade outlets.
* To the northwest of Berkhamsted stand the ruins of Marlin&#x27;s Chapel, a 13th-century chapel next to a medieval fortified farm. The walls and moat surrounding the modern farm still remain and are reputed to be haunted.

* 129 High Street is the Grade II* listed house known as Dean Incent&#x27;s House. (John Incent, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, founded Berkhamsted School.) A 15th century half-timbered house, the interior has original exposed timber framing and several Tudor wall paintings. The building incorporates part of an even older structure and was used as public meeting place before the Court House was built. The house is not normally open to the public.
* The Court House, next to the church, dates from the 16th century, and is believed to lie on the site of the medieval court where the Portmote or Borough Court was held.
* Sayer&#x27;s Almshouses, were the legacy of John Sayer, chief cook to Charles II, at 235–241 High Street, comprise a single-storey row of almshouses built in 1684.
* The Bourne School, at 222 High Street, was the legacy by Thomas Bourne (1656–1729) (Master of the Company of Framework Knitters) to build a charity school in Berkhamsted for 20 boys and 10 girls. The front was rebuilt in 1854 in Jacobean-style red brick; it is not clear if any part of the building predates 1854. In 1875, the pupils were transferred to the National School and the funds used for scholarships.
* The site now occupied by the Pennyfarthing Hotel dates from the 16th century, having been a monastic building used as accommodation for religious guests passing through Berkhamsted or going to the monastery at Ashridge.
* Berkhamsted Town Hall, a Victorian gothic market house and town hall, designed by architect Edward Buckton Lamb (built in 1859, extended in 1890 and restored in 1983–1999), was built by public subscription from Berkhamstedians. It comprised a market hall (now the Copper House restaurant), a large assembly hall and rooms for the Mechanics&#x27; Institute. When Berkhamsted became part of the new Dacorum Borough Council (based in Hemel Hempstead) there were plans to demolish the building; these plans were stopped in the 1970s and 1980s by a ten-year citizens&#x27; campaign, which eventually ended at the High Court.

* The Berkhamsted Canadian totem pole sits adjacent to the canal, close to Castle Street Bridge. In the early 1960s, Roger Alsford, a great-grandson of the founder of the timber company, James Alsford (1841–1912), went to work at the Tahsis lumber mill on Vancouver Island. During a strike, he was rescued from starvation by a local Kwakiutl community. Alsford&#x27;s brother, William John Alsford, visited the island, and in gratitude for the local people&#x27;s hospitality, commissioned a totem pole from the Canadian First Nations artist Henry Hunt. The western red cedar pole, high and in diameter, was carved by Hunt at Thunderbird Park, a centre for First Nation monuments. The completed pole was shipped to Britain and erected at Alsford&#x27;s Wharf in 1968. Alsford&#x27;s warehouses were replaced in 1994 by a private housing development which limit access to the pole, so that it can be viewed only at a distance from the public road. It is one of only a handful of totem poles in the United Kingdom, others being on display at the British Museum and Horniman Museum in London, Windsor Great Park, Bushy Park and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. The carvings on the totem pole represent four figures from First Nations legend: at the top sits Raven, the trickster and creator deity; he sits on the head of Sunman, who has outstretched arms representing the rays of the sun and wears a &quot;copper&quot; (a type of ceremonial shield); Sunman stands on the fearsome witch-spirit Dzunukwa; at the base is the two-headed warrior sea serpent, Sisiutl, who has up-stretched wings.
* Ashridge is a country estate and stately home. Ashridge House is a large Gothic Revival country house built between 1808 and 1814. Since 2015 it has been the home of Hult International Business School&#x27;s Ashridge Executive Education programme (see above for more information about the building). The surrounding country estate is a park managed by the National Trust, consisting of of native broadleaf woodlands, commons and chalk downland on a Chiltern ridge just to the north of Berkhamsted. Ashridge has been featured many times in film and television series due to its distinction as an area of natural beauty. Scenes were filmed for &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; at Golden Valley and &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; at Ashridge&#x27;s ancient Frithsden Beeches Wood. The climbable monument to Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, a tall Doric column with urn (a Grade II* listed building), stands in a grove within Ashridge.

==Associations with the town==
===Twin towns===

Berkhamsted is twinned with:
* Beaune, Burgundy, France
* Neu Isenburg, Hesse, Germany (as part of Dacorum)

The town also has an informal relationship with Barkhamsted, Connecticut, in the United States. The latter presented a gavel and block on 4 July 1976, the U.S. bicentennial, which Berkhamsted Town Council now uses in meetings.

==History==
Clinton Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 12, 1841, from portions of Lebanon Township, based on the results of a referendum held that same day. Portions of the township have been taken to form Clinton town (April 5, 1865, within the township; became independent in 1895), High Bridge township (March 29, 1871) and Lebanon borough (March 26, 1926). The township was named for Governor of New York DeWitt Clinton.

In 1998, Republican Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll proposed to honor former president Ronald Reagan by changing the township&#x27;s name to Reagan Township and renaming Clinton to Reagan, New Jersey.

The council is the township&#x27;s legislative body and is responsible for ordinances, resolutions and the annual budget, as well as most hiring other than those positions delegated to the mayor. The mayor presides over and is eligible to vote at council meetings, but has no veto power.

<text>Delaware Township is a township in Hunterdon County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Part of the township is on the Hunterdon Plateau, while the southern portions are in the Amwell Valley. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 4,560, a decrease of three people (−0.1%) from the 2010 census count of 4,563, which in turn reflected an increase of 85 (+1.9%) from the 4,478 counted in the 2000 census.

The historic community of Sergeantsville is located within Delaware Township, as well as the unincorporated community of Raven Rock.

==History==
The township was first settled in the early 18th century by Colonel John Reading (1657–1717), who was instrumental in the creation of Amwell Township in 1708 and also worked for the creation of Hunterdon County in 1714. The Township adjoins the Delaware River on the southwestern portion of Hunterdon County, which provides its name. The state&#x27;s lone surviving historic covered bridge, Green Sergeant&#x27;s Covered Bridge, crosses the Wickecheoke Creek between Sergeantsville and Rosemont. The Delaware and Raritan Canal parallels the Delaware River along the southern border of the township. Sergeantsville is at the township&#x27;s center and includes the municipal building, local public school and Post Office. A &quot;Thanksgiving in the Country&quot; offers a tour of notable homes in Sergeantsville, which raises funds for the Facial Reconstruction Unit of the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Delaware was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 2, 1838, from a portion of a larger municipality then known as Amwell Township (now defunct). Historian and cartographer John P. Snyder has erroneously stated that a referendum was held on that date, but there was in fact no referendum and the people of Amwell knew nothing about the division until after the Legislature passed the bill. A portion of the township was taken to form Stockton borough (April 14, 1898).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 37.05 square miles (95.95 km2), including 36.66 square miles (94.94 km2) of land and 0.39 square miles (1.01 km2) of water (1.06%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Bowne, Brookville, Dilts Corner, Grover, Headquarters, Locktown, Prallsville, Raven Rock, Rosemont, Sand Brook, Sandy Ridge and Sergeantsville.

The township borders the municipalities of East Amwell Township, Franklin Township, Kingwood Township, Lambertville, Raritan Township, Stockton and West Amwell Township in Hunterdon County; as well as Plumstead Township and Solebury Township in Bucks County across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.

<text>Bolingbroke Castle is a ruined castle in Bolingbroke (now Old Bolingbroke) in Lincolnshire, England.

==Construction==

Most of the castle is built of Spilsby greenstone, as are several nearby churches. The local greenstone is a limestone that proved to be porous, prone to rapid deterioration when exposed to weather and a substandard building material. The castle was constructed as an irregular polygonal enclosure. The castle is one of the earliest examples of a uniform castle designed and built without a keep. It was originally surrounded by a large water-filled moat wide. The curtain wall was up to thick and defended by five D-shaped towers and a twin-towered gate house.

Similar to another castle built by Ranulf during the same period at Beeston in Cheshire, Bolingbroke had no inner defensive keep. The castle relied instead on thick walls and the five D-shaped defensive corner towers. Some design similarities are noted with the contemporary castle at Boulogne-sur-Mer, France that was also constructed without a central donjon.

==History==
The area was first fortified by the Saxons in the 6th or 7th century. In the 12th century the Normans built a Motte-and-bailey on a nearby hill above the settlement of Bolingbroke.
The present structure was founded by Ranulf, Earl of Chester, in 1220 shortly after he returned from the Fifth Crusade.

Ranulf died in 1232 without a male heir, and his titles, lands and castles passed to his sisters. Following the death of Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster in 1361 Bolingbroke passed through marriage into the ownership of John of Gaunt. His wife Blanche of Lancaster, daughter of Henry of Grosmont, was born at the castle in 1342. John and Blanche&#x27;s son, Henry (the future Henry IV), was also born at Bolingbroke Castle in 1367 and consequently was known as &quot;Henry Bolingbroke&quot; before he became king in 1399.

By the 15th and 16th century, the castle had fallen into disrepair although repairs were carried out during the Tudor period. The castle was used by auditors of the Duchy of Lancaster. Structures were named after the officials, including the &quot;Receiver&#x27;s Tower&quot; and the &quot;Feodary&#x27;s Tower&quot;. Lead for the roof of the gatehouse was brought from an abandoned chapel at Trusthorpe. In 1636 a survey found that all of the towers were effectively beyond repair.

At the start of the First English Civil War, Bolingbroke was again put to use as a military fortification garrisoned by Royalist forces. In 1643 it was badly damaged in a siege during the Battle of Winceby. The following year, the castle was recaptured from the Parliamentarians but due to defeats elsewhere was relinquished again. In 1652 the castle was slighted to prevent any further use. The towers and walls were torn down and dumped into the moat.

The last major structure collapsed in 1815.

==Present day==

The castle, which is now a national monument, was excavated in the 1960s and 1970s. It was maintained by English Heritage until 1995 when Heritage Lincolnshire took charge. Much of the lower walls are still visible as are the ground floors of the towers.

In the summertime, the castle is home to numerous events including performances of Shakespeare.

<doc id="125265" wikidata="Q501080" url="?curid=125265" title="Kimbolton Castle">
<text>Kimbolton Castle is a country house in Kimbolton, Cambridgeshire, England. It was the final home of King Henry VIII&#x27;s first wife, Catherine of Aragon. Originally a medieval castle but converted into a stately palace, it was the family seat of the Earls and Dukes of Manchester from 1615 until 1950. It now houses Kimbolton School.

==History==
The castle was built by Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex, in the late 12th century. The inner court was rebuilt by Anne, Duchess of Buckingham, in the late 15th century.

The castle was acquired by Sir Richard Wingfield in 1522 but after his death in 1525, was inherited by his eldest son, Charles. The Wingfield family reconstructed the medieval castle as a Tudor Manor house, parts of which survive to this present day. Catherine of Aragon was sent here in April 1534 for refusing to give up her status or deny the validity of her marriage. In July 1534, a fool in the retinue of the diplomat Eustache Chapuys tried to swim the moat, drawing attention to her imprisonment. The fenland climate damaged her health, and she died in the castle on 7 January 1536.

The castle was bought by Sir John Popham in 1600 and was later purchased by Sir Henry Montagu, later created 1st Earl of Manchester, in 1615. The 4th Earl of Manchester, who was created 1st Duke of Manchester in 1719, had many works of reconstruction carried out between 1690 and 1720. These works included the rebuilding of the south wing, which had fallen down, to a design by Sir John Vanbrugh who was assisted by another great architect of the time, Nicholas Hawksmoor. The 4th Duke of Manchester commissioned Robert Adam to design the gatehouse which was constructed in 1766.

Many members of the Montagu family (Earls and Dukes of Manchester) are buried at St Andrew&#x27;s Church in Kimbolton. Several Montagu monuments still exist in the South Chapel, while the Montagu vault (extended in 1853) is located beneath the North Chapel.

The 10th Duke of Manchester sold the contents in 1949, and the castle and were sold to Kimbolton School in 1951.

==Warren House==
On the grounds of the castle is Warren House, where the warrener (estate&#x27;s rabbit gamekeeper) used to live, converted into a late 18th-century folly on command of one of the castle&#x27;s inhabitants to add interest to his horizon, complete with a single decorative facade facing the castle; it is Grade II* listed and owned by the Landmark Trust. The Trust renovated the house, under a design from architect Oliver Caroe, between 2011 and 2012.

<doc id="125267" wikidata="Q153330" url="?curid=125267" title="Prince Andrew, Duke of York">
<text>Prince Andrew, Duke of York (Andrew Albert Christian Edward; born 19 February 1960) is a member of the British royal family. He is the third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and a younger brother of King Charles III. Andrew was born second in the line of succession to the British throne and is now eighth, and the first person in the line who is not a descendant of the reigning monarch.

Andrew served in the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot and instructor and as the captain of a warship. During the Falklands War, he flew on multiple missions including anti-surface warfare, casualty evacuation, and Exocet missile decoy. In 1986, he married Sarah Ferguson and was made Duke of York. They have two daughters: Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Their marriage, separation in 1992, and divorce in 1996 attracted extensive media coverage. As Duke of York, Andrew undertook official duties and engagements on behalf of his mother. He served as the UK&#x27;s Special Representative for International Trade and Investment for 10 years until July 2011.

In 2014, Virginia Giuffre alleged that, as a 17-year-old, she was sex trafficked to Andrew by convicted sex offenders Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Andrew denied any wrongdoing. Following criticism for his association with Epstein and Maxwell, Andrew resigned from public roles in May 2020, and his honorary military affiliations and royal charitable patronages were removed by the Queen in January 2022. He was the defendant in a civil lawsuit over sexual assault filed by Giuffre in New York State. The lawsuit was settled out of court in February 2022; in the settlement, Andrew paid an undisclosed sum to Giuffre. 

==Early life==

Andrew was born in the Belgian Suite of Buckingham Palace on 19 February 1960 at 15:30 (GMT), the third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He was baptised in the palace&#x27;s Music Room on 8 April 1960.

Andrew was the first child born to a reigning British monarch since Princess Beatrice in 1857. As with his siblings, Charles, Anne, and Edward, Andrew was looked after by a governess, who was responsible for his early education at Buckingham Palace. He was sent to Heatherdown School near Ascot in Berkshire. In September 1973, he entered Gordonstoun, in northern Scotland, which his father and elder brother had also attended. He was nicknamed &quot;the Sniggerer&quot; by his schoolmates at Gordonstoun, because of &quot;his penchant for off-colour jokes, at which he laughed inordinately&quot;. While there, he spent six months—from January to June 1977—participating in an exchange programme to Lakefield College School in Canada. He left Gordonstoun in July two years later with A-levels in English, history, and economics.

==Military service==

===Royal Navy===
The Royal Household announced in November 1978 that Andrew would join the Royal Navy the following year. In December, he underwent various sporting tests and examinations at the Aircrew Selection Centre, at RAF Biggin Hill, along with further tests and interviews at HMS &quot;Daedalus&quot;, and interviews at the Admiralty Interview Board, . During March and April 1979, he was enrolled at the Royal Naval College Flight, undergoing pilot training, until he was accepted as a trainee helicopter pilot and signed on for 12 years from 11 May 1979. On 1 September of the same year, Andrew was appointed as a midshipman, and entered Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. During 1979 he also completed the Royal Marines All Arms Commando Course for which he received his Green Beret. He was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant on 1 September 1981 and appointed to the Trained Strength on 22 October.

After passing out from Dartmouth, Andrew went on to elementary flying training with the Royal Air Force at RAF Leeming, and later, basic flying training with the navy at HMS &quot;Seahawk&quot;, where he learned to fly the Gazelle helicopter. After being awarded his wings, he moved onto more advanced training on the Sea King helicopter, and conducted operational flying training until 1982. He joined carrier-based squadron, 820 Naval Air Squadron, serving aboard the aircraft carrier, .

===Falklands War===
On 2 April 1982, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a British overseas territory claimed by it, leading to the Falklands War. &quot;Invincible&quot; was one of the two operational aircraft carriers available at the time, and, as such played a major role in the Royal Navy task force assembled to sail south to retake the islands.

Andrew&#x27;s place on board and the possibility of the Queen&#x27;s son being killed in action made the British government apprehensive, and the cabinet desired that Prince Andrew be moved to a desk job for the duration of the conflict. The Queen, though, insisted that her son be allowed to remain with his ship. Prince Andrew remained on board &quot;Invincible&quot; to serve as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot, flying on missions that included anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, Exocet missile decoy, casualty evacuation, transport, and search and air rescue. He witnessed the Argentine attack on the SS &quot;Atlantic Conveyor&quot;.

At the end of the war, &quot;Invincible&quot; returned to Portsmouth, where Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip joined other families of the crew in welcoming the vessel home. The Argentine military government reportedly planned, but did not attempt, to assassinate Andrew on Mustique in July 1982. Though he had brief assignments to HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;, RNAS Culdrose, and the Joint Services School of Intelligence, Prince Andrew remained with &quot;Invincible&quot; until 1983. Commander Nigel Ward&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Sea Harrier Over the Falklands&quot;, described Prince Andrew as &quot;an excellent pilot and a very promising officer.&quot;

===Career naval officer===
In late 1983, Andrew transferred to RNAS Portland, and was trained to fly the Lynx helicopter. On 1 February 1984, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, whereupon Queen Elizabeth II appointed him as her personal aide-de-camp. Prince Andrew served aboard HMS &quot;Brazen&quot; as a flight pilot until 1986, including deployment to the Mediterranean Sea as part of Standing NRF Maritime Group 2. He undertook the Lieutenants&#x27; Greenwich Staff course. On 23 October 1986, the Duke of York (as he was by then) transferred to the General List, enrolled in a four-month helicopter warfare instructor&#x27;s course at RNAS Yeovilton, and, upon graduation, served from February 1987 to April 1988 as a helicopter warfare officer in 702 Naval Air Squadron, RNAS Portland. He also served on HMS &quot;Edinburgh&quot; as an officer of the watch and Assistant Navigating Officer until 1989, including a six-month deployment to the Far East as part of exercise &quot;Outback 88&quot;.

The Duke of York served as flight commander and pilot of the Lynx HAS3 on HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; from 1989 to 1991. He also acted as force aviation officer to Standing NRF Maritime Group 1 while &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was flagship of the NATO force in the North Atlantic from 1990 to 1991. He passed the squadron command examination on 16 July 1991, attended the Staff College, Camberley the following year, and completed the Army Staff course. He was promoted to lieutenant-commander on 1 February and passed the ship command examination on 12 March 1992. From 1993 to 1994, Prince Andrew commanded the Hunt-class minehunter HMS &quot;Cottesmore&quot;.

From 1995 to 1996, Andrew was posted as senior pilot of 815 Naval Air Squadron, then the largest flying unit in the Fleet Air Arm. His main responsibility was to supervise flying standards and to guarantee an effective operational capability. He was promoted to commander on 27 April 1999, finishing his active naval career at the Ministry of Defence in 2001, as an officer of the Diplomatic Directorate of the Naval Staff. In July of that year, Andrew was retired from the Active List of the Navy. Three years later, he was made an honorary captain. On 19 February 2010, his 50th birthday, he was promoted to rear admiral. Five years later, he was promoted to vice admiral.

He ceased using his honorary military titles in January 2022. The action came after more than 150 Royal Navy, RAF and Army veterans signed a letter, requesting that Queen Elizabeth II remove his honorary military appointments in light of his involvement in a sexual assault civil case. It was reported that he would still retain his service rank of vice admiral.

==Personal life==

===Personal interests===
Andrew is a keen golfer and has had a low single-figure handicap. He was captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews between 2003 and 2004—during the club&#x27;s 250th anniversary season—was patron of a number of royal golf clubs, and had been elected as an honorary member of many others. In 2004, he was criticised by Labour Co-op MP Ian Davidson, who in a letter to the NAO questioned Andrew&#x27;s decision to fly to St Andrews on RAF planes for two golfing trips. Andrew resigned his honorary membership of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews when the Queen removed royal patronages at several golf clubs. His honorary membership of the Royal Dornoch Golf Club was revoked in the following month.

Andrew is a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights, the senior maritime City livery company.

===Relationship with Koo Stark===
Andrew met the American photographer and actress Koo Stark in February 1981, before his active service in the Falklands War. In October 1982, they took a holiday together on the island of Mustique. Tina Brown said that Stark was Andrew&#x27;s only serious love interest. In 1983, they split up under pressure from press, paparazzi, and palace. In 1997, Andrew became godfather to Stark&#x27;s daughter. When Andrew was facing accusations in 2015 over his connection to Jeffrey Epstein, Stark came to his defence.

===Marriage to Sarah Ferguson===
Andrew married Sarah Ferguson at Westminster Abbey on 23 July 1986. On the same day, Queen Elizabeth II created him Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, and Baron Killyleagh; the first two of these titles were previously held by both his maternal grandfather and great-grandfather. Prince Andrew had known Ferguson since childhood; they had met occasionally at polo matches, and became reacquainted with each other at Royal Ascot in 1985.

The couple appeared to have a happy marriage and had two daughters together, Beatrice and Eugenie, presenting a united outward appearance during the late 1980s. Sarah&#x27;s personal qualities were seen as refreshing in the context of the formal protocol surrounding the royal family. However, Andrew&#x27;s frequent travel due to his military career, as well as relentless, often critical, media attention focused on the Duchess of York, led to fractures in the marriage. On 19 March 1992, the couple announced plans to separate and did so in an amicable way. In August of that same year, tabloid media outlets published pictures of John Bryan sucking on Sarah&#x27;s toes, which effectively ended any hopes of a reconciliation between Andrew and Ferguson. The Duchess had claimed throughout the separation that Bryan was her financial adviser, a claim that Prince Andrew believed.

The marriage ended in divorce on 30 May 1996. The Duke of York spoke fondly of his former wife in 2008: &quot;We have managed to work together to bring our children up in a way that few others have been able to and I am extremely grateful to be able to do that.&quot;
In May 2010, Sarah was filmed by a &quot;News of the World&quot; reporter saying Andrew had agreed that if she were to receive £500,000, he would meet the donor and pass on useful top-level business contacts. She was filmed receiving, in cash, $40,000 as a down payment. The paper said that Andrew did not know of the arrangement. In July 2011, Sarah stated that her multi-million pound debts had been cleared due to the intervention of her former husband, whom she compared to a &quot;knight on a white charger&quot;.

In 2012, Sarah admitted that she had made a &quot;gigantic error of judgement&quot; in allowing Jeffrey Epstein to pay off a debt for her, and apologised for accepting money from him. She did, however, continue to defend Andrew&#x27;s controversial former friendship with Epstein.

===Residences===
As Andrew and Sarah shared custody of their two daughters, the family continued to live at Sunninghill Park (built near Windsor Great Park for the couple in 1990) until Andrew moved to the Royal Lodge in 2004. In 2007, Sarah moved into Dolphin House in Englefield Green, less than a mile from the Royal Lodge. In 2008, a fire at Dolphin House resulted in Sarah moving into Royal Lodge, again sharing a house with Andrew. As of April 2024 they are still cohabiting there. Andrew&#x27;s lease of Royal Lodge is for 75 years, with the Crown Estate as landlord, at a cost of a single £1 million premium and a commitment to spend £7.5 million on refurbishment. In March 2023, it was reported that Andrew had been offered Frogmore Cottage after his nephew Prince Harry was requested to vacate the residence. The offer came amid reports that Andrew could no longer afford the Royal Lodge&#x27;s running costs as he was about to lose his annual grant.

===Health===
On 2 June 2022, Andrew tested positive for COVID-19, and it was announced that he would not be present at the Platinum Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 3 June.

Andrew is a teetotaller.

== Allegations of sexual abuse ==

===Jeffrey Epstein and related associations===
Andrew was friends with Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2008. BBC News reported in March 2011 that the friendship was producing &quot;a steady stream of criticism&quot;, and there were calls for him to step down from his role as trade envoy. Andrew was also criticised in the media after his former wife, Sarah, disclosed that he helped arrange for Epstein to pay off £15,000 of her debts. Andrew had been photographed in December 2010 strolling with Epstein in Central Park during a visit to New York City. In July 2011, Andrew&#x27;s role as trade envoy was terminated and he reportedly cut all ties with Epstein.

On 30 December 2014, a Florida court filing by lawyers Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell alleged that Andrew was one of several prominent figures, including lawyer Alan Dershowitz and &quot;a former prime minister&quot;, to have participated in sexual activities with a minor later identified as Virginia Giuffre (then known by her maiden name Virginia Roberts), who was allegedly trafficked by Epstein. An affidavit from Giuffre was included in an earlier lawsuit from 2008 accusing the US Justice Department of violating the Crime Victims&#x27; Rights Act during Epstein&#x27;s first criminal case by not allowing several of his victims to challenge his plea deal; Andrew was otherwise not a party to the lawsuit.

In January 2015, there was renewed media and public pressure for Buckingham Palace to explain Andrew&#x27;s connection with Epstein. Buckingham Palace stated that &quot;any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue&quot;, and later repeated the denial. Requests from Giuffre&#x27;s lawyers for a statement from Andrew about the allegations, under oath, were returned unanswered.

Giuffre asserted that she had sex with Andrew on three occasions, including a trip to London in 2001 when she was 17, and later in New York and on Little Saint James in the U.S. Virgin Islands. She alleged Epstein paid her $15,000 after she had sex with Andrew in London. Flight logs show Andrew and Giuffre were in the places she alleged their meetings took place. Andrew and Giuffre were also photographed together with his arm round her waist, with an Epstein associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, in the background, though Andrew&#x27;s supporters have repeatedly said the photo is fake and edited. Giuffre stated that she was pressured to have sex with Andrew and &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have dared object&quot; as Epstein, through contacts, could have her &quot;killed or abducted&quot;.

On 7 April 2015, Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that the &quot;sex allegations made against Andrew in court papers filed in Florida must be struck from the public record&quot;. Marra made no ruling as to whether claims by Giuffre are true or false, specifically stating that she may later give evidence when the case comes to court.

Juan &quot;John&quot; Alessi, who was Epstein&#x27;s butler, stated in a deposition he filed for Giuffre&#x27;s 2016 defamation case against Maxwell that Andrew&#x27;s hitherto unremarked visits to the Epstein house in Palm Beach were more frequent than previously thought. He maintained that Andrew &quot;spent weeks with us&quot; and received &quot;daily massages&quot;.

In August 2019, court documents associated with a defamation case between Giuffre and Maxwell revealed that a second girl, Johanna Sjoberg, gave evidence alleging that Andrew had placed his hand on her breast while in Epstein&#x27;s mansion posing for a photo with his &quot;Spitting Image&quot; puppet. Later that month, Andrew released a statement that said, &quot;At no stage during the limited time I spent with [Epstein] did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction,&quot; though he expressed regret for meeting him in 2010 after Epstein had already pleaded guilty to sex crimes for the first time. At the end of August 2019, &quot;The New Republic&quot; published a September 2013 email exchange between John Brockman and Evgeny Morozov, in which Brockman mentioned seeing a British man nicknamed &quot;Andy&quot; receive a foot massage from two Russian women at Epstein&#x27;s New York residence during his last visit to the mansion in 2010, and had realised &quot;that the recipient of Irina&#x27;s foot massage was His Royal Highness, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York&quot;.

In July 2020, Caroline Kaufman, an alleged victim of Epstein, said in a federal lawsuit that she had seen Andrew at Epstein&#x27;s New York mansion in December 2010. In November 2021 Lawrence Visoski, Epstein&#x27;s pilot, testified in court during Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s trial that Prince Andrew flew in Epstein&#x27;s private plane along with other prominent individuals, including Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and John Glenn. Visoski stated he did not notice any sexual activity or wrongdoing on the plane. Similarly, Andrew&#x27;s name was recorded on 12 May 2001 by Epstein&#x27;s pilot David Rodgers in his logbook, and he testified that Andrew flew three times with Epstein and Giuffre in 2001. The following month a picture of Epstein and Maxwell, sitting at a cabin on the Queen&#x27;s Balmoral estate, around 1999, at the invitation of Andrew, was shown to the jury to establish their status as partners.

On 5 January 2022, Virginia Giuffre&#x27;s former boyfriend, Anthony Figueroa, said on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; that Giuffre told him Epstein would take her to meet Prince Andrew. He alleged the meeting had taken place in London. In a court filing, Andrew&#x27;s lawyers had previously referred to a statement by Figueroa&#x27;s sister, Crystal Figueroa, who alleged that in her bid to find victims for Epstein, Giuffre had asked her, &quot;Do you know any girls who are kind of slutty?&quot; The same month, Carolyn Andriano, who as a 14-year-old was introduced by Giuffre to Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein and was a prosecution witness in Maxwell&#x27;s trial, said in an interview with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that then 17-year-old Giuffre told her in 2001 that she had slept with Prince Andrew. She stated, &quot;And [Giuffre] said, &#x27;I got to sleep with him&#x27;. She didn&#x27;t seem upset about it. She thought it was pretty cool.&quot;

In an ITV documentary, former royal protection officer Paul Page, who was convicted and given a six year sentence following a £3 million property investment scam in 2009, recounted Maxwell&#x27;s frequent visits to Buckingham Palace, and suggested the two might have had an intimate relationship, while Lady Victoria Hervey added that Andrew was present at social occasions held by Maxwell. The Duke of York&#x27;s name and contact numbers for Buckingham Palace, Sunninghill Park, Wood Farm and Balmoral also appeared in Maxwell and Epstein&#x27;s &#x27;Little Black Book&#x27;, a list of contacts of the duo&#x27;s powerful and famous friends. In February 2022, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; published a photograph of Andrew along with Maxwell giving a tour of Buckingham Palace to Andrew&#x27;s guests Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey, with a member of the tour party describing Maxwell as &quot;the one who led us into Buckingham Palace&quot;.

In October 2022, Ghislaine Maxwell was interviewed by a documentary filmmaker while serving her sentence in prison, and when asked about her relationship with Andrew, Maxwell stated that she felt &quot;bad&quot; for him but accepted their &quot;friendship could not survive my conviction. He is paying such a price for the association. I consider him a dear friend. I care about him.&quot; She also stated that she now believed the photograph showing her together with Andrew and Virginia Giuffre was not &quot;a true image&quot;, and added that in an email to her lawyer in 2015 she was trying to confirm that she recognised her own house, but the whole image cannot be authentic as &quot;the original has never been produced&quot;. In another interview from prison, she said the photo was &quot;a fake … there&#x27;s never been an original and further there is no photograph. I&#x27;ve only ever seen a photocopy of it.&quot; Following the allegations, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, which first published the photograph in 2011, was contacted by photographer Michael Thomas who took 39 copies of the image, both front and back. The back of the photo has a time stamp showing it was developed on 13 March 2001 – three days after Andrew allegedly engaged in sexual activity with Giuffre – and it was printed at a one-hour photo lab at Walgreens in Florida, near Giuffre&#x27;s former home.

Giuffre has claimed that on the first night she allegedly had sex with Andrew they got into the bath where &quot;he started licking my toes, between my toes, the arches of my feet&quot; before they went into the bedroom and had sex. She repeated these claims in a 2019 BBC interview. She described the bathroom in her unpublished memoir, stating &quot;It was a beige marble tiled floor with a porcelain Victorian-style bathtub in the middle of the room.&quot; In January 2023, Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s brother Ian Maxwell disputed the claims by releasing photos showing his acquaintances sitting in the bathtub where the incident allegedly took place. The photos were originally reserved as a defense for Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s legal team if Giuffre was asked to testify. Ian Maxwell believed the photos &quot;show conclusively that the bath is too small for any sort of sex frolicking. There is no &#x27;Victorian bath&#x27;, as Giuffre has claimed, which is proved both by the attached plan of the bathroom and the photos themselves.&quot;

In January 2024, a series of documents related to Epstein were released by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, including a motion from 2015 by two women which described Andrew having sexual relations with one of them – speculated to be Giuffre – at Maxwell&#x27;s flat in London, in New York, and on Epstein&#x27;s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands &quot;in an orgy with numerous other underaged girls&quot;. In a separate document, Maxwell recalled Andrew visiting Epstein&#x27;s private island only once, adding there were no girls or women there other than the staff. She also stated that she had &quot;no recollection&quot; as to whether she introduced Andrew to Giuffre. In another unsealed document, Juan Alessi, who worked at Epstein&#x27;s Palm Beach residence, stated under oath that Andrew &quot;spent weeks with us&quot; and had &quot;daily massages&quot;. Another deposition contained references to Johanna Sjoberg&#x27;s claim that Andrew had groped her breast while she was sitting on his lap. The Metropolitan Police announced that they would not be launching an investigation into the allegations but would assess &quot;new and relevant&quot; information should they come to light.

===&quot;Newsnight&quot; interview===

In November 2019, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; arranged an interview between Andrew and presenter Emily Maitlis in which he recounted his friendship with Epstein for the first time. In the interview, Prince Andrew says he met Epstein in 1999 through Maxwell; this contradicts comments made by Andrew&#x27;s private secretary in 2011, who said the two met in &quot;the early 1990s&quot;. The Duke also said he did not regret his friendship with Epstein, saying &quot;the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful&quot;.

In the interview, Andrew denied having sex with Giuffre on 10 March 2001, as she had accused, because he had been at home with his daughters after attending a party at PizzaExpress in Woking with his elder daughter Beatrice. Prince Andrew also added that Giuffre&#x27;s claims about dancing with him at Tramp while he was sweaty were false due to him temporarily losing the ability to sweat after an &quot;adrenaline overdose&quot; during the Falklands War. According to physicians consulted by &quot;The Times&quot;, an adrenaline overdose typically causes excessive sweating in humans. He also said that he does not drink, despite Giuffre&#x27;s account of him providing alcohol for them both. Accounts from other people have supported his statement that he does not drink.

Andrew said that he had stayed in Epstein&#x27;s mansion for three days in 2010, after Epstein&#x27;s conviction for sex offences against a minor, describing the location as &quot;a convenient place to stay&quot;. The Duke said that he met Epstein for the sole purpose of breaking off any future relationship with him. He also said that he would be willing to testify under oath regarding his associations with Epstein. A series of emails published as part of a civil case in 2023 included snippets showing Andrew, Epstein and Jes Staley exchanging emails, which suggested that the Duke was in contact with Epstein on several occasions in 2010. Another series of emails published in court documents from a different civil case showed that in February 2011 Epstein was in contact with a &quot;member of the British Royal Family&quot;, believed to be Andrew.

The interview was believed by Maitlis and &quot;Newsnight&quot; to have been approved by the Queen, although &quot;palace insiders&quot; speaking to &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; disputed this. One of Prince Andrew&#x27;s official advisors resigned just prior to the interview being aired. Although Andrew was pleased with the outcome of the interview – reportedly giving Maitlis and the &quot;Newsnight&quot; team a tour of Buckingham Palace – it received negative reactions from both the media and the public, both in and outside of the UK. The interview was described as a &quot;car crash&quot;, &quot;nuclear explosion level bad&quot;, and the worst public relations crisis for the royal family since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Experts and those with ties to Buckingham Palace said that the interview, its fallout and the abrupt suspension of Andrew&#x27;s royal duties were unprecedented.

===Civil lawsuit===

In August 2021, Virginia Giuffre sued Prince Andrew in the federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, accusing him of &quot;sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress.&quot; The lawsuit was filed under New York&#x27;s Child Victims Act, legislation extending the statute of limitations where the plaintiff had been under 18 at the time, 17 in Giuffre&#x27;s case. On 29 October 2021, Andrew&#x27;s lawyers filed a response, stating that their client &quot;unequivocally denies Giuffre&#x27;s false allegations&quot;. On 12 January 2022 Judge Kaplan rejected Andrew&#x27;s attempts to dismiss the case, allowing the sexual abuse lawsuit to proceed. In February, the case was settled out of court, with Andrew making a donation to Giuffre&#x27;s charity for victims of abuse. Criminal proceedings in the United States over Virginia Giuffre&#x27;s claims remained possible.

===Repercussions===
On 20 November 2019, a statement from Buckingham Palace announced that Andrew was suspending his public duties &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;. The decision, made with the consent of the Queen, was accompanied by the insistence that Andrew sympathised with Epstein&#x27;s victims. Other working royals took over his commitments in the short term. On 24 November, the palace confirmed that Andrew was to step down from all 230 of his patronages, although he expressed a wish to have some sort of public role at some future time.

On 16 January 2020, it was reported that the Home Office was recommending &quot;a major downgrade of security&quot; for Andrew, which would put an end to &quot;his round-the-clock armed police protection&quot;. On 28 January 2020, US Attorney Geoffrey Berman stated that Prince Andrew had provided &quot;zero co-operation&quot; with federal prosecutors and the FBI regarding the ongoing investigations, despite his initial promise in the &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview when he said he was willing to help the authorities. Sources close to Andrew said that he &quot;hasn&#x27;t been approached&quot; by US authorities and investigators, and his legal team announced that he had offered to be a witness &quot;on at least three occasions&quot; but had been refused by the Department of Justice. The US authorities responded to the claim and denied being approached by Andrew for an interview and labeled his statements as a way &quot;to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate&quot;. Spencer Kuvin, who represented nine of Epstein&#x27;s victims, said Andrew could be arrested if he ever returns to the United States.

In March 2020, Andrew hired crisis-management expert Mark Gallagher, who had helped high-profile clients falsely accused by Operation Midland. In April 2020, it was reported that the Duke of York Young Champions Trophy would not be played anymore, after all activities carried out by the Prince Andrew Charitable Trust were stopped. In May 2020 it was announced that Andrew would permanently resign from all public roles over his Epstein ties.

In June 2020, it became known that Andrew is a person of interest in a criminal investigation in the United States, and that the United States had filed a mutual legal assistance request to British authorities in order to question Andrew. Following the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell in July 2020, Andrew cancelled a planned trip to Spain, reportedly due to fears that he might be arrested and extradited to the United States. In the 2019 BBC interview, Andrew told &quot;Newsnight&quot; his association with Epstein was derived from his long-standing friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell, who was later convicted of colluding in Epstein&#x27;s sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc30/12/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2020, anti-child trafficking protesters chanting &quot;Paedophile! Paedophile!&quot; referencing Andrew gathered outside Buckingham Palace, and videos of the protest went viral. In 2020, prosecutors seeking access to Andrew made a formal mutual legal assistance request to the British government. In early 2021 there were at least two trespassing incidents reported at his Windsor property, and in December he was verbally abused by a woman as he was driving.

In January 2022, Andrew&#x27;s social media accounts were deleted, his page on the royal family&#x27;s website was rewritten in the past tense and his military affiliations and patronages were removed to put an emphasis on his departure from public life. He also stopped using the style His Royal Highness (HRH), though it was not formally removed. In the same month, York Racecourse announced that it would rename the Duke of York Stakes, and Prince Andrew High School in Nova Scotia, which had announced two years earlier that it was considering a name change, stated that it would have a new name at the next academic year. In February 2022, Belfast City Council and the Northern Ireland Assembly decided not to fly a union flag for Andrew&#x27;s birthday. In the same month, the Mid and East Antrim Borough Council announced that they would hold a debate in June 2022 regarding a motion to rename Prince Andrew Way in Carrickfergus. On 27 April 2022 York City Council unanimously voted to remove Andrew&#x27;s Freedom of the City. Rachael Maskell York Central MP said Andrew was the &quot;first to ever have their freedom removed&quot;. In June 2022, Maskell introduced a &#x27;Removal of Titles&#x27; private members bill in the House of Commons. The bill would have enabled people considered unworthy to be stripped of aristocratic titles, which is not presently possible without a parliamentary act. The monarch or a committee of Parliament would have been able to remove a title instead.

In March 2022, Andrew made his first official appearance in months, helping the Queen to walk into Westminster Abbey for a memorial service for his father, the Duke of Edinburgh. There was a mixed reaction by commentators to his presence, with some saying that it would send the wrong message to victims of sexual abuse &quot;about how powerful men are able to absolve themselves from their conduct&quot; and others arguing that his appearance was required as &quot;a son, in memory of his father&quot;.

In June 2022, Andrew took part in private aspects of the Garter Day ceremony, including lunch and investiture of new members, but was excluded from the public procession following an intervention by his brother Charles and his nephew William that banned him from appearing anywhere the public could see him.

Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022, Andrew appeared in civilian clothing at various ceremonial events. As he walked behind his mother&#x27;s coffin in a funeral procession in Edinburgh on 12 September, a 22-year-old man shouted &quot;Andrew, you&#x27;re a sick old man&quot;; the heckler was arrested and charged with committing a breach of the peace. Andrew wore military uniform for a 15-minute vigil by the Queen&#x27;s coffin at Westminster Hall on 16 September.

In October 2022, it was reported that Andrew no longer received any government funding. In November 2022, it was reported that he was set to lose his police protection as he was no longer expected to carry out public duties in accordance with the King&#x27;s wishes. In December 2022, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that Andrew had written to the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police to complain about the situation. His armed personal protection officers were expected to be replaced by private security guards, who are likely to be paid for by the King, at an estimated cost of up to £3 million a year. In January 2023, it was reported that he could no longer use his suite of rooms at Buckingham Palace. In August 2024, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that the King would be withdrawing funds for Andrew&#x27;s security by the end of October, which would require him to pay for future security operations at his Royal Lodge home.

== Activities and charitable work ==
===Patronages===

The Duke was patron of the Middle East Association (MEA), the UK&#x27;s premier organisation for promoting trade and good relations with the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey and Iran. Since his role as Special Representative for International Trade and Investment ended Andrew continued to support UK enterprise without a special role. Robert Jobson said he did this work well and wrote, &quot;He is particularly passionate when dealing with young start-up entrepreneurs and bringing them together with successful businesses at networking and showcasing events. Andrew is direct and to the point, and his methods seem to work&quot;.

The Duke was also patron of Fight for Sight, a charity dedicated to research into the prevention and treatment of blindness and eye disease, and was a member of the Scout Association. He toured Canada frequently to undertake duties related to his Canadian military role. Rick Peters, the former commanding officer of the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada stated that Prince Andrew was &quot;very well informed on Canadian military methods&quot;. He became the patron of the charity Attend in 2003, and was a member of the International Advisory Board of the Royal United Services Institute.

On 3 September 2012, Andrew was among a team of 40 people who abseiled down The Shard (tallest building in Europe) to raise money for educational charities the Outward Bound Trust and the Royal Marines Charitable Trust Fund. The Duke of York lent his support to organisations that focus on science and technology by becoming the patron of Catalyst Inc and TeenTech. In 2014, Andrew visited Geneva, Switzerland, to promote British science at CERN&#x27;s 60th anniversary celebrations.
In 2013, it was announced that Andrew was becoming the patron of London Metropolitan University and the University of Huddersfield. In July 2015, he was installed as Chancellor of the University of Huddersfield. In recognition of Andrew&#x27;s promotion of entrepreneurship he was elected to an Honorary Fellowship at Hughes Hall in the University of Cambridge on 1 May 2018. On 19 November 2019, the Students&#x27; Union of the University of Huddersfield passed a motion to lobby Andrew to resign as its chancellor, as London Metropolitan University was considering Andrew&#x27;s role as its patron. On 21 November, Andrew relinquished his role as chancellor of the University of Huddersfield.

In March 2019, Andrew took over the patronage of the Outward Bound Trust from his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, serving up until his own resignation in November 2019. Prince Andrew had held the position of chairman of the board of trustees of the organisation since 1999. In May 2019, it was announced that Andrew had succeeded Lord Carrington as patron of the Royal Fine Art Commission Trust.

On 13 January 2022, it was announced that his royal patronages had been handed back to the Queen to be distributed among other members of the royal family. In January 2023, it was reported that King Charles III had agreed to let Andrew pursue some business interests.

===Initiatives===
While touring India as a part of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 2012, Andrew became interested in the work of Women&#x27;s Interlink Foundation (WIF), a charity which helps women acquire skills to earn income. He and his family later initiated Key to Freedom, a project which tries to &quot;find a route to market for products made by WIF&quot;.

In 2014, Andrew founded the Pitch@Palace initiative to support entrepreneurs with the amplification and acceleration of their business ideas. Entrepreneurs selected for Pitch@Palace Bootcamp are officially invited by Andrew to attend St James Palace in order to pitch their ideas and to be connected with potential investors, mentors and business contacts. In May 2018, he visited China and opened the Pitch@Palace China Bootcamp 2.0 at Peking University. On 18 November 2019, accountancy firm KPMG announced it would not be renewing its sponsorship of Prince Andrew&#x27;s entrepreneurial scheme Pitch@Palace, and on 19 November Standard Chartered also withdrew its support.

In addition, the Duke founded The Prince Andrew Charitable Trust which aimed to support young people in different areas such as education and training. In May 2020, it was reported that the Prince Andrew Charitable Trust was under investigation by the Charity Commission regarding some regulatory issues about £350,000 of payments to his former private secretary Amanda Thirsk. He also founded a number of awards including Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award (iDEA), a programme to develop the digital and enterprise skills, the Duke of York Award for Technical Education, given to talented young people in technical education, and the Duke of York Young Entrepreneur Award, which recognised talents of young people in entrepreneurship.

== Controversies and other incidents ==

===Special Representative for International Trade and Investment===

From 2001 until July 2011, Andrew worked with UK Trade &amp; Investment, part of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, as the United Kingdom&#x27;s Special Representative for International Trade and Investment. The post, previously held by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, involved representing and promoting the UK at various trade fairs and conferences around the world. His suitability for the role was challenged in the House of Commons by Shadow Justice Minister Chris Bryant in February 2011, at the time of the 2011 Libyan civil war, on the grounds that he was &quot;not only a very close friend of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, but also ... a close friend of the convicted Libyan gun smuggler Tarek Kaituni&quot;. Further problems arose as he hosted a lunch for Sakher El Materi, a member of the corrupt Tunisian regime, at the Palace around the time of the Tunisian Revolution. Andrew also formed a friendship with Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan who has been criticised for corruption and for abuses of human rights by Amnesty International, and visited him both during and after his tenure as the UK trade envoy. As of November 2014, Andrew had met Aliyev, on 12 occasions. The controversies, together with his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, made him step down from the role in 2011.

Andrew did not receive a salary from the UK Trade &amp; Investment for his role as Special Representative, but he went on expenses-paid delegations and was alleged to have occasionally used trips paid for by the government for his personal leisure, which earned him the nickname &quot;Airmiles Andy&quot; by the press. On 8 March 2011, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported: &quot;In 2010, the Prince spent £620,000 as a trade envoy, including £154,000 on hotels, food and hospitality and £465,000 on travel.&quot;

===Banque Havilland scandal===

In November 2020, and following reviews of emails, internal documents, and unreported regulatory filings as well as interviews with 10 former bank insiders, &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; reported on Andrew using his royal cachet and role as trade envoy for helping David Rowland and his private bank, Banque Havilland, with securing deals with clients around the world. The Rowland family are among the investment advisers to Andrew, and he was present for the official opening ceremony of their bank in July 2009. It has been alleged that Banque Havilland sought to service dictators and kleptocrats.

===Allegations of Government coverup===
Official documents covering Andrew&#x27;s business trips between 2001 and 2011 will not be released by the Foreign Office until 2065. This is part of what has been claimed to be a concerted Government coverup to prevent Andrew&#x27;s activities being publicly known, even when national security was potentially compromised.

===Alleged comments on corruption and Kazakhstan===
As the United Kingdom&#x27;s Special Trade Representative, Andrew travelled the world to promote British businesses. It was revealed in the United States diplomatic cables leak that Andrew had been reported on by Tatiana Gfoeller, the United States Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, discussing bribery in Kyrgyzstan and the investigation into the Al-Yamamah arms deal. The Duke, she explained, &quot;was referencing an investigation, subsequently closed, into alleged kickbacks a senior Saudi royal had received in exchange for the multi-year, lucrative BAE Systems contract to provide equipment and training to Saudi security forces.&quot; The dispatch continued: &quot;His mother&#x27;s subjects seated around the table roared their approval. He then went on to &#x27;these (expletive) journalists, especially from the National Guardian , who poke their noses everywhere&#x27; and (presumably) make it harder for British businessmen to do business. The crowd practically clapped!&quot;

In May 2008, he attended a goose-hunt in Kazakhstan with President Nursultan Nazarbayev. In 2010, it was revealed that the President&#x27;s billionaire son-in-law Timur Kulibayev paid Andrew&#x27;s representatives £15 million – £3 million over the asking price – via offshore companies, for Andrew&#x27;s Surrey mansion, Sunninghill Park. Kulibayev frequently appears in US dispatches as one of the men who have accumulated millions in gas-rich Kazakhstan. It was later revealed that Andrew&#x27;s office tried to get a crown estate property close to Kensington Palace for Kulibayev at that time.
In May 2012, it was reported that Swiss and Italian police investigating &quot;a network of personal and business relationships&quot; allegedly used for &quot;international corruption&quot; were looking at the activities of Enviro Pacific Investments which charges &quot;multi-million pound fees&quot; to energy companies wishing to deal with Kazakhstan. The trust is believed to have paid £6 million towards the purchase of Sunninghill which now appears derelict. In response, a Palace spokesman said &quot;This was a private sale between two trusts. There was never any impropriety on the part of The Duke of York&quot;.

Libby Purves wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; in January 2015: &quot;Prince Andrew dazzles easily when confronted with immense wealth and apparent power. He has fallen for &#x27;friendships&#x27; with bad, corrupt and clever men, not only in the US but in Libya, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tunisia, wherever.&quot;

In May 2016, a fresh controversy broke out when the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; alleged that Andrew had brokered a deal to assist a Greek and Swiss consortium in securing a £385 million contract to build water and sewerage networks in two of Kazakhstan&#x27;s largest cities, while working as British trade envoy, and had stood to gain a £4 million payment in commission. The newspaper published an email from Andrew to Kazakh oligarch Kenges Rakishev, (who had allegedly brokered sale of the Prince&#x27;s Berkshire mansion Sunninghill Park), and said that Rakishev had arranged meetings for the consortium. After initially saying the email was a forgery, Buckingham Palace sought to block its publication as a privacy breach. The Palace denied the allegation that Andrew had acted as a &quot;fixer&quot; calling the article &quot;untrue, defamatory and a breach of the editor&#x27;s code of conduct&quot;.

A former Foreign Office minister, MP Chris Bryant stated: &quot;When I was at the Foreign Office it was very difficult to see in whose interests he [Andrew] was acting. He doesn&#x27;t exactly add lustre to the Royal diadem&quot;.

===Arms sales===
In March 2011, Kaye Stearman of the Campaign Against the Arms Trade told Channel 4 News CAAT sees Prince Andrew as part of a bigger problem, &quot;He is the front man for UKTI. Our concerns are not just Prince Andrew, it&#x27;s the whole UKTI set up. They see arms as just another commodity but it has completely disproportionate resources. At the London office of UKTI the arms sector has more staff than all the others put together. We are concerned that Prince Andrew is used to sell arms, and where you sell arms it is likely to be to despotic regimes. He is the cheerleader in chief for the arms industry, shaking hands and paving the way for the salesmen.&quot;

In January 2014, Prince Andrew took part in a delegation to Bahrain, a close ally of the United Kingdom. Spokesman for CAAT, Andrew Smith said, &quot;We are calling on Prince Andrew and the UK government to stop selling arms to Bahrain. By endorsing the Bahraini dictatorship Prince Andrew is giving his implicit support to their oppressive practices. When our government sells arms it is giving moral and practical support to an illegitimate and authoritarian regime and directly supporting their systematic crackdown on opposition groups. (...) We shouldn&#x27;t allow our international image to be used as a PR tool for the violent and oppressive dictatorship in Bahrain.&quot;

Andrew Smith has also said, &quot;The prince has consistently used his position to promote arms sales and boost some of the most unpleasant governments in the world, his arms sales haven&#x27;t just given military support to corrupt and repressive regimes. They&#x27;ve lent those regimes political and international legitimacy.&quot;

===Reaction to election to the Royal Society===
Andrew&#x27;s election to the Royal Society prompted &quot;Britain&#x27;s leading scientists&quot; to &quot;revolt&quot; due to Andrew&#x27;s lack of scientific background, with some noting he had only a secondary school level of education. In an op-ed in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, pharmacologist, Humboldt Prize recipient, and Fellow of the Royal Society, David Colquhoun opined, in references to Andrew&#x27;s qualifications, that &quot;if I wanted a tip for the winner of the 14.30 at Newmarket, I&#x27;d ask a royal. For most other questions, I wouldn&#x27;t.&quot;

=== Allegations of racist language ===
Rohan Silva, a former Downing Street aide, claimed that, when they met in 2012, Andrew had commented, &quot;Well, if you&#x27;ll pardon the expression, that really is the nigger in the woodpile.&quot; Former home secretary Jacqui Smith also claims that Andrew made a racist comment about Arabs during a state dinner for the Saudi royal family in 2007. Buckingham Palace denied that Andrew had used racist language on either occasion.

=== Allegations of ramming gates in Windsor Great Park ===
In March 2016, Republic CEO Graham Smith filed a formal report to the police, requesting an investigation into allegations that Andrew had damaged sensor-operated gates in Windsor Great Park by forcing them open in his Range Rover to avoid going an extra mile on his way home. The Thames Valley Police dismissed the reports due to lack of details.

===Treatment of reporters, servants and others===
During his four-day Southern California tour in 1984, Andrew squirted paint onto American and British journalists and photographers who were reporting on the tour, after which he told Los Angeles county supervisor Kenneth Hahn, &quot;I enjoyed that&quot;. The incident damaged the clothes and equipment of reporters and the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; submitted a $1,200 bill to the British consulate asking for financial compensation.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2022, &quot;his brusque manner with servants is well-documented. A senior footman once told a reporter who worked undercover at Buckingham Palace that on waking the prince &#x27;the response can easily be &quot;fuck off&quot; as good morning&#x27;.&quot; Former royal protection officer Paul Page said, in an ITV documentary, that Andrew maintained a collection of &quot;50 or 60 stuffed toys&quot; and if they &quot;weren&#x27;t put back in the right order by the maids, he would shout and scream and become verbally abusive.&quot; Page later stated in the documentary &quot;Prince Andrew: Banished&quot; that different women would visit Andrew every day, and when one was denied entry into his residence by the security Andrew allegedly called one of the officers a &quot;fat, lardy-ass cunt&quot; over the phone. The Duke&#x27;s former maid, Charlotte Briggs, also recalled setting up the teddy bears on his bed and told &quot;The Sun&quot; that when she was bitten by his Norfolk Terrier in 1996 he only laughed and &quot;wasn&#x27;t bothered&quot;. She said that she was reduced to tears by Andrew for not properly closing the heavy curtains in his office and added that his behaviour was in contrast to that of his brothers Charles and Edward who &quot;weren&#x27;t anything like him&quot; and his father Philip whom she described as &quot;so nice and gentlemanly&quot;.

Massage therapist Emma Gruenbaum said Andrew regularly overstepped the mark, making creepy sexual comments when she came to give him a massage. Gruenbaum maintained Andrew talked continually about sex during the first massage and wanted to know when she last had sex. Gruenbaum said Andrew arranged regular massages for roughly two months, and she believed requests for massages stopped when he realised he would not get more.

===Finances and debt problems===

The Duke of York received a £249,000 annuity from the Queen, which was cut from April 2023. In the twelve-month period up to April 2004, he spent £325,000 on flights, and his trade missions as special representative for UKTI cost £75,000 in 2003. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported in July 2008 that for &quot;the Duke of York&#x27;s public role... he last year received £436,000 to cover his expenses&quot;. He has a Royal Navy pension of £20,000.

The Duke is also a keen skier and in 2014 bought a skiing chalet in Verbier, Switzerland, for £13 million jointly with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. In May 2020, it was reported that they were in a legal dispute over the mortgage. To purchase the chalet, they secured a loan of £13.25 million and were expected to pay £5 million in cash instalments which, after applying interests, amounted to £6.8 million. Despite claims that the Queen would help pay the debt, a spokesperson for Andrew confirmed that she &quot;will not be stepping in to settle the debt&quot;. 

&quot;The Times&quot; reported in September 2021 that Andrew and Sarah had reached a legal agreement with the property&#x27;s previous owner and would sell the house. The owner agreed to receive £3.4 million, half of the amount that she was owed, as she had been under the impression that Andrew and Sarah were dealing with financial troubles. The money from selling the property is reportedly to be used to pay Andrew&#x27;s legal expenses over the civil lawsuit as well. In June 2022 it was reported in &quot;Le Temps&quot;, a Swiss newspaper, that the chalet has been frozen because of a £1.6 million debt Andrew owes unnamed people. Law professor Nicolas Jeandin told &quot;Le Temps&quot; &quot;A sale is in principle impossible, except with the agreement of the creditor.&quot;

In 2021, Bloomberg News reported that a firm connected to David Rowland had been paying off Andrew&#x27;s debts. In November 2017, Andrew borrowed £250,000 from Banque Havilland, adding to an existing £1.25 million loan that had been &quot;extended or increased 10 times&quot; since 2015. Documents showed that while &quot;credibility of the applicant&quot; had been questioned, he was given the loan in an attempt to &quot;further business potential with the Royal Family&quot;. 11 days later and in December 2017, £1.5 million was transferred from an account at Albany Reserves, which was controlled by the Rowland family, to Andrew&#x27;s account at Banque Havilland, paying off the loan that was due in March 2018.

Several months after Andrew&#x27;s controversial 2019 &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview, his private office established the Urramoor Trust, which owned both Lincelles Unlimited (established 2020) and Urramoor Ltd (established 2013), and according to &quot;The Times&quot; was set up to support his family. Lincelles was voluntarily wound up in 2022. Andrew was described as a &quot;settlor but not a beneficiary&quot;, and did not own either of the companies, though Companies House listed him and his private banker of 20 years Harry Keogh as people with &quot;significant control&quot;.

In March 2022, it was reported that, on 15 November 2019, the wife of the jailed former Turkish politician İlhan İşbilen transferred £750,000 to Andrew in the belief that it would help her secure a passport. The Duke repaid the money 16 months later after being contacted by İşbilen&#x27;s lawyers. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that the money sent to Andrew&#x27;s account had been described to the bankers &quot;as a wedding gift&quot; for his elder daughter, Princess Beatrice, though the court documents did not include any suggestions that Beatrice was aware of the transactions. İşbilen alleges that a further £350,000 payment was made to Andrew through businessman Selman Turk, who İşbilen is suing for fraud. Turk had been awarded the People&#x27;s Choice Award for his business Heyman AI at a Pitch@Palace event held at St James&#x27;s Palace days before the £750,000 payment was made by İşbilen. 

Libyan-born convicted gun smuggler, Tarek Kaituni introduced Andrew to Selman Turk in May or June 2019 and held later meetings on at least two occasions. Kaituni, for whom Andrew allegedly lobbied a British company, had reportedly given Princess Beatrice a £18,000 gold and diamond necklace for her 21st birthday in 2009, and was invited to Princess Eugenie&#x27;s wedding in 2018. Andrew also got &quot;half&quot; of £100,000 that Turk claimed was a payment to businessman Adrian Gleave to fund a search for &quot;finding yoghurt production facilities in America&quot;.

===Relationship with alleged Chinese spy===
In December 2024, it was reported that Andrew had invited Chris Yang, a Chinese businessman who was initially given the name &quot;H6&quot; in legal documents, to events at royal residences. Yang was given permission by a royal aide, Dominic Hampshire, to act on the duke&#x27;s behalf when dealing with potential investors in China. Yang was barred from entry to the United Kingdom in 2023 due to alleged engagement in &quot;covert and deceptive activity&quot; on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. Andrew ceased all contact with Yang following government concerns.

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==

===Titles and styles===

Andrew was originally styled &quot;His Royal Highness The Prince Andrew&quot;. On 23 July 1986, he was granted the Dukedom of York, the Earldom of Inverness, and the Barony of Killyleagh, and assumed the style &quot;His Royal Highness The Duke of York&quot;.

, Andrew is eighth in the line of succession to the British throne. On rare occasions, he is known by his secondary titles of Earl of Inverness in Scotland, and Baron Killyleagh in Northern Ireland.

In January 2022, it was reported that, while Andrew retains the style of His Royal Highness, he would no longer use it in a public capacity. He has since used it in a private capacity.

In 2019, Inverness residents started a campaign to strip him of the Earldom of Inverness, saying that &quot;it is inappropriate that Prince Andrew is associated with our beautiful city&quot;, in light of his friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There was a renewed petition in Inverness in 2022. Similar pleas have been made by people affiliated with the village of Killyleagh regarding his title of Baron Killyleagh, and the city of York, with Labour Co-op MP for York Central, Rachael Maskell, stating that she would look for ways to make Andrew give up his ducal title if he did not voluntarily relinquish it. In April 2022, several York councillors called for Andrew to lose the title of Duke of York.

<text>Pembroke Castle () is a medieval castle in the centre of Pembroke, Pembrokeshire in Wales. The castle was the original family seat of the Earldom of Pembroke. A Grade I listed building since 1951, it underwent major restoration during the early 20th century.

In 1093, Arnulf of Montgomery built the first castle at the site when he fortified the promontory beside the Pembroke River during the Norman invasion of Wales. A century later, the castle was given by Richard I to William Marshal, who became one of the most powerful men in 12th-century Britain. He rebuilt Pembroke Castle in stone, creating most of the structure that remains today. The castle is open to the public and is the largest privately owned castle in Wales.

==Construction==
The castle is sited on a strategic rocky promontory by the Milford Haven Waterway. The first fortification on the site was a Norman motte-and-bailey. It had earthen ramparts and a timber palisade.

In 1189, Pembroke Castle was acquired by William Marshal. He soon became Lord Marshal of England, and set about turning the earth and wood fort into an impressive Norman stone castle. The inner ward, which was constructed first, contains the huge round keep with its domed roof. Its original first-floor entrance was through an external stairwell. Inside, a spiral staircase connected its four stories. The keep&#x27;s domed roof also has several putlog holes that supported a wooden fighting-platform. If the castle was attacked, the hoarding allowed defenders to go out beyond the keep&#x27;s massive walls above the heads of the attackers.
The inner ward&#x27;s curtain wall had a large horseshoe-shaped gateway. But only a thin wall was required along the promontory. This section of the wall has a small observation turret and a square stone platform. Domestic buildings including William Marshal&#x27;s Great Hall and private apartments were within the inner ward. The 13th century keep is tall with walls up to thick at its base.

In the late 13th century, additional buildings were added to the inner ward, including a new Great Hall. A 55-step spiral staircase was also created that led down to a large limestone cave, known as Wogan Cavern, beneath the castle. The cave, which was created by natural water erosion, was fortified with a wall, a barred gateway and arrowslits. It may have served as a boathouse or a sallyport to the river where cargo or people could have been transferred.

The outer ward was defended by a large twin-towered gatehouse, a barbican and several round towers. The outer wall is thick in places and constructed from Siltstone ashlar.

Although Pembroke Castle is a Norman-style enclosure castle with great keep, it can be more accurately described as a linear fortification because, like the later 13th-century castles at Caernarfon and Conwy, it was built on a rocky promontory surrounded by water. This meant that attacking forces could only assault on a narrow front. Architecturally, Pembroke&#x27;s thickest walls and towers are all concentrated on its landward side facing the town, with Pembroke River providing a natural defense around the rest of its perimeter.

== History ==
Pembroke Castle stands on a site that has been occupied at least since the Roman period. Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury founded the first castle here in the 11th century. Although only made from earth and wood, Pembroke Castle resisted several Welsh attacks and sieges over the next 30 years. The castle was established at the heart of the Norman-controlled lands of southwest Wales. Arnulf de Montgomery appointed Gerald de Windsor as his castellan at Pembroke.

When William Rufus died, Arnulf de Montgomery joined his elder brother, Robert of Bellême, in rebellion against Henry I, William&#x27;s brother and successor as king; when the rebellion failed, he was forced to forfeit all his British lands and titles. Henry appointed his castellan, but when the chosen ally turned out to be incompetent, the King reappointed Gerald in 1102. By 1138 King Stephen had given Pembroke Castle to Gilbert de Clare who used it as an important base in the Norman invasion of Ireland.
In August 1189 Richard I arranged the marriage of Isabel, de Clare&#x27;s granddaughter, to William Marshal who received both the castle and the title, Earl of Pembroke. He had the castle rebuilt in stone and established the great keep at the same time. Marshal was succeeded in turn by each of his five sons. His third son, Gilbert Marshal, was responsible for enlarging and further strengthening the castle between 1234 and 1241. All of Marshal&#x27;s sons died childless. In 1247, the castle was inherited by William de Valence (a half-brother of Henry III), who had become Earl of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan de Munchensi, William Marshal&#x27;s granddaughter. 

The de Valence family held Pembroke for 70 years. During this time, the town was fortified with defensive walls, three main gates and a postern. Pembroke Castle became de Valence&#x27;s military base for fighting the Welsh princes during the conquest of North Wales by Edward I between 1277 and 1295. On the death of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, William de Valence&#x27;s son, the castle passed through marriage to the Hastings family. In 1389, 17-year-old John Hastings died in a jousting accident, ending a line of inheritance stretching back 250 years.
Pembroke Castle then reverted to Richard II. Short tenancies were then granted by The Crown for its ownership. By 1400 Owain Glyndŵr had begun a rebellion in Wales. However, Pembroke escaped attack because the castle&#x27;s Constable, Francis а Court, paid off Glyndŵr in gold. Then in 1452, the castle and the earldom were presented to Jasper Tudor by his half-brother Henry VI. Tudor brought his widowed sister-in-law, Margaret Beaufort, to Pembroke where, in 1457, she gave birth to her only child, who was to become King Henry VII of England.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the castle was a place of peace until the outbreak of the English Civil War. Although most of South Wales sided with the King, Pembroke declared for Parliament. It was besieged by Royalist troops but was saved after Parliamentary reinforcements arrived by sea from nearby Milford Haven. Parliamentary forces then went on to capture the Royalist castles of Tenby, Haverfordwest and Carew. 

In 1648, at the beginning of the Second Civil War, Pembroke&#x27;s commander Colonel John Poyer led a Royalist uprising alongside Colonel Powell, Tenby Castle, and Sir Nicholas Kemoys, Chepstow Castle. Oliver Cromwell came to Pembroke on 24 May 1648 and took the castle after a seven-week siege. Its three leaders were found guilty of treason and Cromwell ordered the castle to be destroyed. Townspeople were even encouraged to disassemble the fortress and re-use its stone for their purposes.

The castle was then abandoned and allowed to decay. It remained in ruins until 1880, when a three-year restoration project was undertaken. Nothing further was done until 1928, when Major-General Sir Ivor Philipps acquired the castle and began an extensive restoration of the castle&#x27;s walls, gatehouses, and towers. After his death, a trust was set up for the castle, jointly managed by the Philipps family and Pembroke town council.

== Archaeology ==

In July 2022, archaeological survey funded by the Natural History Museum and the British Cave Research Society uncovered evidence of prehistoric megafauna such as reindeer and woolly mammoth bones, in addition to seashells, pigs and deer at Wogan Cavern. According to the researchers, the cave was occupied by residents as far back as the Paleolithic and Mesolithic Periods.

==Film location==
Pembroke has appeared in numerous feature films. These include the 1968 film &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;, the 1976 film &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, the BBC adaptation of C.S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, the film of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot;, and the 2016 Anglo-American romantic film &quot;Me Before You&quot;. It features as the fictional Penleven Castle in Cornwall in the 2015 comedy film &quot;The Bad Education Movie&quot;.

<doc id="125269" wikidata="Q1025341" url="?curid=125269" title="Cadw">
<text> (, a Welsh verbal noun meaning &quot;keeping/preserving&quot;) is the historic environment service of the Welsh Government and part of the Tourism and Culture group. works to protect the historic buildings and structures, the landscapes and heritage sites of Wales, to make them available for the public to visit, enjoy, and understand their significance. manages 127 state-owned properties and sites. It arranges events at its managed properties, provides lectures and teaching sessions, offers heritage walks, and hosts an online shop. Members of the public can become members of to gain membership privileges.

Cadw marked its 40th year in 2024, by which time more than 33,000 properties, structures and monuments were under its care.

==Aims and objectives==

As the Welsh Government&#x27;s historic environment service, is charged with protecting the historic environment of Wales, and making it accessible to members of the public. To this end, in 2010–11 it identified four aspects of its work: it would take measures to conserve the heritage of Wales, its ancient buildings, and monuments; it would aim to sustain the distinctive characters of the different landscapes and urban areas; it would try to help people understand and care about their country, their locality, its history, and Wales&#x27; place in the world; and it would aim to improve the wellbeing of people in Wales.

===Conservation and protection=== 
 is responsible for the care and upkeep of four World Heritage Sites in Wales: the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, the Slate Landscape of Northwest Wales, and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape.

Many of these listed sites are in private ownership, but has a specific responsibility (as of 2022) for the care and upkeep of the 130 historic sites that are in state ownership, employing staff at 28 sites. Many of Wales&#x27; great castles and other monuments, such as bishop&#x27;s palaces, historic houses, and ruined abbeys, are protected and maintained in this way, as well being opened to the public. has been appointed by the Welsh Government and is the successor body in Wales to the Ministry of Works.

Cadw also identifies (and develops the criteria for identification) of historical assets in Wales. In 2011 there were 29,936 listed buildings in Wales; of these, 493 were the most important Grade I listed buildings, 2,124 were Grade II* and 27,319 were Grade II listed. Most of these were in private ownership. Also in Wales were 4,175 Scheduled Monuments, 6 Designated historic wrecks, and 523 Conservation Areas; these designations means that the buildings or objects concerned are protected by statute. A register of significant Welsh battlefield sites is also under preparation.

Cadw also provides support to other organisations with responsibility for understanding, conserving and interpreting the archaeology and cultural heritage of Wales. These include the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales which functions as an archive (around 90% of its funding comes from Welsh Government), and the Welsh Archaeological Trusts which are active in research, heritage management and supporting sustainable development across Wales (only 50% of their funding is from Cadw).

===Area character studies===

There are 58 Historic Landscapes and 384 Historic parks and gardens in Wales. Cadw is also undertaking urban character studies of urban areas. Eight had been completed by September 2013. Combined with a register of buildings and ancient monuments at risk these aim to enable management decision making and grant allocation to strengthen the character of different areas.

===Care and operation===


Cadw operates most of the heritage sites in its care and opens them to the public. In 2010–11 there were an estimated two million visits to Cadw properties. In some cases, these are major tourist attractions and offer tours of the monuments, exhibitions and display panels. Cadw also produces books and guidebooks on many of their properties. Many of the sites are unstaffed, free to access and have interpretation boards to explain their significance. Alongside this, a mobile app was released in 2016, which provides basic information for visitors as well as an interpretative aspect for larger sites.

The five most frequently visited properties in 2010–11 were Caernarfon Castle (192,695 visits), Conwy Castle (190,031 visits), Caerphilly Castle (94,707 visits), Harlech Castle (93,242 visits) and Beaumaris Castle (80,660 visits).

To provide a better context for the history of Wales, in 2010–11 Cadw was developing thematic &#x27;All Wales Interpretation Plans&#x27;, that could develop themes across numerous sites and localities. There were eight themes:-
* Origins and prehistory.
* Roman invasion and settlement.
* Celtic saints and pilgrimage.
* Churches, chapels and monastic landscapes.
* Castles and Princes of Medieval Wales.
* Artistic responses to the landscape.
* The Defence of the Realm – Pembrokeshire.
* Wales – the first industrial nation.

==Membership==
Cadw Membership, formerly known as Heritage in Wales, gives the member free admission to all Cadw properties and World Heritage Sites in Wales for the length of their membership (annual or life). Other membership advantages are a free magazine (Heritage in Wales), reduced prices at the online gift shop and free entry to most Cadw-organised events. Cadw has also entered into reciprocal agreements with English Heritage, Historic Scotland and Manx National Heritage for free entry to the properties they manage.

==Events==
Cadw organises events for adults and families. These include lectures, re-enactments of historical events, and training sessions for teachers, informing them on how to use visits to historic sites to help deliver literacy and numeracy skills and an appreciation of history.

Some 200 historical and cultural events a year are held. Cadw also provides work experience opportunities for young people, and sandwich courses for undergraduates.

Every autumn since 2014 CADW has held an Open Doors festival, with sites, buildings (and parts of buildings) being made accessible which are not normally open to the public. Though funded and organised by CADW, the event includes many non-CADW sites and generally takes place in September.

==Equivalent organisations==
Equivalent organisations in other parts of the United Kingdom are: 
* England – Historic England and English Heritage
* Scotland – Historic Environment Scotland
* Northern Ireland – Northern Ireland Environment Agency and Department for Communities (formerly the Environment and Heritage Service)
* Isle of Man – Manx National Heritage

<doc id="125270" wikidata="Q55720" url="?curid=125270" title="Sarah, Duchess of York">
<text>Sarah, Duchess of York (born Sarah Margaret Ferguson; 15 October 1959), also known by the nickname Fergie, is a British author, philanthropist, television personality, and member of the extended British royal family. She is the former wife of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, who is the second son of Queen Elizabeth II and a younger brother of King Charles III.

Ferguson was raised in Dummer, Hampshire, and attended the Queen&#x27;s Secretarial College. She later worked for public relations firms in London, and then for a publishing company. She began a relationship with Andrew in 1985, and they were married on 23 July 1986 at Westminster Abbey. They have two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Their marriage, separation in 1992, and divorce in 1996 attracted much media coverage.

Both during and after her marriage, Sarah has been involved with several charities as a patron and spokesperson. Her charity work primarily revolves around helping cancer patients and children. She has been the patron of Teenage Cancer Trust since 1990 and founded Children in Crisis and Sarah&#x27;s Trust. In the years after her divorce, Sarah was the subject of scandals that affected her relationship with the royal family, but she has appeared in various royal events in recent years. She has written several books for children and adults and has worked on TV and in film production.

==Early life==
Sarah Margaret Ferguson was born on 15 October 1959 at London Welbeck Hospital, London. She is the second daughter of Major Ronald Ferguson (1931–2003) and Susan Barrantes (née Wright; 1937–1998). She has one older full sister, Jane. After Ferguson&#x27;s parents divorced in 1974, her mother married polo player Héctor Barrantes in 1975 and moved to Trenque Lauquen in the Argentine pampas. Sarah stayed at the Dummer Down Farm at Dummer, Hampshire, her father&#x27;s home since age 8. Major Ferguson married Susan Deptford in 1976 and had three more children: Andrew, Alice, and Elizabeth. Sarah later mentioned that at the age of 12, when her parents&#x27; marriage started to fall apart, she developed an eating disorder and &quot;turned to overeating for comfort&quot;.

Ferguson, known informally as &quot;Fergie&quot;, once described her family as &quot;country gentry with a bit of old money&quot;. She is a descendant of King Charles II of England via three of his illegitimate children: Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond; James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth; and Anne Lennard, Countess of Sussex. She has aristocratic ancestry, being the great-great-granddaughter of the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, a great-granddaughter of the 8th Viscount Powerscourt, and a descendant of the 1st Duke of Abercorn and the 4th Duke of Devonshire. Ferguson is distantly related to Prince Andrew, as they are both descended from the Duke of Devonshire as well as King James VI and I.

Ferguson attended Daneshill School, Stratfield Turgis. The staff of the school described her as a &quot;courageous, bubbly and outgoing little girl&quot;. She then attended Hurst Lodge School in Ascot. She did not shine academically but showed talent in swimming and tennis. At a young age, she developed an interest in skiing and later briefly worked as a chalet girl. In her teenage years, she worked both as a cleaner and waitress. After finishing a course at Queen&#x27;s Secretarial College at the age of 18, Ferguson went to work for an art gallery. Later she worked in two public relations firms in London, and then for a publishing company. Prior to marriage, she dated Kim Smith-Bingham, a stockbroker, and Paddy McNally, a motor racing manager more than 20 years her senior.

==Marriage to Prince Andrew==

On 19 March 1986, Prince Andrew (fourth in line to the throne at the time) and Sarah Ferguson announced their engagement. Prince Andrew had known Ferguson since childhood, and they had met occasionally at polo matches and became reacquainted with each other at Royal Ascot in 1985. Also prior to their engagement, Ferguson had accompanied Diana, Princess of Wales, during her official tour of Andrew&#x27;s ship HMS &quot;Brazen&quot;. Prince Andrew designed the engagement ring himself. It consisted of ten diamonds surrounding a Burmese ruby. He chose the Burmese ruby to complement Sarah&#x27;s red hair. Her friendly approach and fun spirit made her a welcomed addition to the royal family.

After securing the Queen&#x27;s consent (which at that time was required by the Royal Marriages Act 1772 for all descendants of King George III), Andrew and Sarah were married in Westminster Abbey on 23 July 1986. The Queen bestowed the title Duke of York upon Prince Andrew, and, as his new wife, Sarah automatically assumed her husband&#x27;s royal and ducal status and became &quot;Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York&quot;. As Duchess of York, Sarah joined her husband in carrying out royal engagements, including official overseas visits.
In 1987, the Duke and Duchess of York undertook a 25-day tour of Canada. In February 1987, Sarah got a private pilot&#x27;s licence and, after passing a 40-hour training course that was paid for by Lord Hanson as a wedding gift, was presented with her wings at RAF Benson in December. On 22 January 1988, during the trip to New York to attend a fundraising event, Sarah was attacked by a young man at the entrance of her hotel. The man, who was screaming &quot;murderers 3/8&quot; and had the Irish Republican Army flag in his hands when he rushed at Sarah, was &quot;charged with attempted assault on the Duchess and assault on a federal agent&quot;. Later, a State Department press officer stated that &quot;she was unharmed in the incident&quot;. In March 1988, the Duke and Duchess of York visited California. The trip was described by two British newspapers as a &quot;brash, vulgar, excessive, weak-humored exhibition by two royals&quot;. The couple was defended by city officials of Los Angeles who stated that the criticism was &quot;awful&quot; and offensive, and observers described the Duke and his wife&#x27;s behaviour as friendly and said that they fulfilled their duties. In May 1989, Sarah went on an official solo trip to Berlin.

The couple became parents on 8 August 1988, with the birth of their daughter Beatrice. Sarah suffered from high blood pressure and excessive water retention during her pregnancy. In September, Sarah joined her husband in Australia for an official visit. The decision to leave her newborn daughter at home in the UK while she was touring the country brought her criticism from the press and media. Their second child, another daughter, Eugenie, was born on 23 March 1990 by caesarean section. During her marriage, the tabloid press ridiculed the Duchess of York for her weight (which climbed to (220 lbs) during her first pregnancy), labelling her the &quot;Duchess of Pork&quot; and &quot;Fat Fergie&quot;. She vowed to lose weight after the birth of her first daughter. In 1989 Sarah was credited with kickstarting the UK popularity of exercise regime Callanetics after it was widely reported that founder Callan Pinckney had given her private tuition. Sarah received praise for her weight loss and some criticism for not gaining enough weight during her second pregnancy. Sarah later discussed the negative effect of the press stories about her weight on her self-esteem and added that they made her eating disorder worse.

=== Separation and divorce ===
Biographer Sarah Bradford described how Andrew&#x27;s duties as a naval officer required him to stay away from home for long periods. According to Sarah&#x27;s account, the couple saw each other 40 days a year in the first five years of their marriage. By 1991, the marriage was in trouble, as Sarah was finding life as a member of the royal family increasingly difficult. Her friendship with Texan multimillionaire Steve Wyatt (son of Lynn Wyatt) gained much publicity when photographs, including one of Wyatt with Sarah&#x27;s toddler daughter, appeared in newspapers in January 1992. The Duke and Duchess of York announced their separation on 19 March 1992. Following the separation, the palace announced that Sarah would no longer carry out public engagements on behalf of the Queen. Furthermore, the Queen announced in a statement that she would not take responsibility for Sarah&#x27;s debts. Sarah separated her residence from her husband and moved to Romenda Lodge on the Wentworth Estate, Surrey, in 1992.

In August 1992, the British tabloid &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; published surreptitiously taken photographs of John Bryan, an American financial manager, sucking on Sarah&#x27;s toes as she sunbathed topless. Sarah endured widespread public ridicule, contributing to her further estrangement from the British royal family. French magazine &quot;Paris Match&quot; was ordered to pay £84,000 in damages for publishing the photographs, though the original amount sought was £1.32 million. On 28 March 1993, it was announced that the formal separation agreement between the Duke and Duchess had been settled, despite months of speculation that the couple might be reconciling. In 1995, Prince Andrew&#x27;s aunt Princess Margaret, who had received a bouquet of flowers sent by Sarah, reportedly wrote in a letter to Sarah: &quot;You have done more to bring shame on the family than could ever have been imagined&quot;.

Reports and speculation about the couple reuniting continued into late 1995, ending when the Duke and Duchess announced their mutual decision to divorce in April 1996. In the years after her divorce, Sarah claimed that she had received £15,000 a year as a divorce settlement and cited her deal as a spokeswoman with Weight Watchers as her main &quot;source of income&quot;. However, subsequent information given by senior officials to &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; revealed that Sarah had received £350,000 in cash, £500,000 from the Queen to buy a new house for her and the children, and a monthly allowance that was estimated to have reached £500,000 in total by 2010. The couple shared custody of their children. In November 1996, Sarah published her autobiography &quot;My Story&quot; and embarked on a promotional tour to support it. On a US chat show she implied she and Andrew had had an open relationship, and that throughout the marriage and separation &quot;He always knew exactly what was going on&quot;, she said. &quot;It&#x27;s not a one-way street. We respect each other&#x27;s space.&quot; In a 2007 interview, as to why they finalised their divorce she said, &quot;I wanted to work; it&#x27;s not right for a princess of the royal house to be commercial, so Andrew and I decided to make the divorce official so I could go off and get a job.&quot;

The decree nisi was granted on 17 April 1996 and the divorce was finalised on 30 May 1996, after which she legally retained the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; with the style of other divorced peeresses. However, it was announced in April that Sarah had chosen not to use the style &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; and would relinquish it under the divorce terms. In accordance with letters patent issued in August 1996 regulating post-divorce royal titles, Sarah formally ceased being a &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.
Since her divorce, Sarah has attended some functions with her daughters, such as the investitures of the Duke of York into the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the Garter, and Royal Ascot, and on those occasions, she is afforded the courtesy of treatment as a member of the royal family. Sarah hinted at the idea of remarrying Andrew in several interviews. In August 2013, she was invited to stay at Balmoral Castle with Prince Andrew and their daughters as guests of the Queen, and in September 2013, in response to a question about the possibility of remarrying Andrew, Sarah said, &quot;He&#x27;s still my handsome prince, he&#x27;ll always be my handsome prince.&quot;

She was not invited to the 1999 wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones or the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, but she attended the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018. However, she did not receive an invitation to the evening reception at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles, and was reportedly &quot;deeply upset&quot; by her exclusion.

The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office has listed Sarah as a member of the royal family, along with other extended family members such as Daniel Chatto and Mike Tindall. she is not, however, listed on a section of the royal family&#x27;s website titled &quot;Members of the Royal Family&quot;. She attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022, and was seated by her daughters&#x27; side, but she was not invited to the coronation of King Charles III in May 2023.

On 25 December 2023, Sarah joined the royal family for Christmas at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham for the first time since 1992.

==Personal life after divorce==

After the divorce, the British tabloids continued to cover Sarah&#x27;s lifestyle. In 1995, a baggage handler at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City pleaded guilty to stealing her $382,000 diamond necklace and bracelet. Sarah&#x27;s commercial interests have included an eleven-year endorsement with Weight Watchers and product development and promotion with Wedgwood and Avon.

Until 2004, the Duke of York and his former wife shared the family&#x27;s home, Sunninghill Park in Berkshire. That year, the Duke moved to the refurbished Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, previously the home of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who resided there until her death in 2002. In 2007, Sarah rented Dolphin House in Englefield Green, less than a mile from Royal Lodge; a fire at Dolphin House in 2008 caused her to vacate the premises and move into Royal Lodge with her former husband.

In 2015, Sarah was reported to have moved out of Royal Lodge and assumed residence in Verbier, Switzerland, where she and the Duke of York owned a £13 million chalet. She applied for Swiss residency in 2016. Sarah also maintains a rented apartment in Eaton Square in London and a room at Royal Lodge.

As one of the victims of the News International phone hacking scandal which came into public notice in 2006, Sarah received an undisclosed amount in an out-of-court settlement. In April 2016, she was named in the Panama Papers.

===Debt problems===
In the mid-1990s, Sarah reportedly had a £4.2 million deficit in her bank account which she paid off by going on &quot;a four-year earning spree&quot; in the United States.

In 2006, Sarah used the money she had earned from her career as a film producer and writer to found Hartmoor LLC in the US. A lifestyle company, it was set to help with her &quot;career in publishing, media and public speaking&quot;. The company collapsed in 2009, leaving Sarah with a debt of £630,000. Later in the same year, it was revealed that she was in a financial dispute with three firms and in September she was summoned &quot;to court in the UK for unpaid bills&quot;. It was reported in August 2010 that Sarah might declare voluntary bankruptcy with debts of £5 million, though other sources had suggested she owed about £2 million.

In March 2011, it was reported that Jeffrey Epstein had helped Sarah avoid bankruptcy by paying off some of her debts. The payments were reportedly made after intervention from the Duke of York. She later admitted getting money from Epstein and called it a &quot;gigantic error&quot;. In the summer of 2011, &quot;Finding Sarah&quot; aired on the OWN network. One episode of the U.S.-filmed reality series depicted Sarah meeting with Suze Orman, the internationally known financial advisor, receiving from Orman a strict lecture and practical advice on how to resolve her financial issues. Juan Alessi, a staff member at Epstein&#x27;s Florida residence for 12 years, said in an unsealed deposition that he believed Ferguson visited &quot;only once and for a short time&quot;.

In May 2020, it was reported that Andrew and Sarah were in a legal dispute over a debt from the 2014 purchase of their Swiss chalet. They had taken out a mortgage of £13.25 million and were expected to pay the remaining £5 million of the purchase price in cash instalments by the end of 2019; interest had increased this to £6.8 million. Despite reports that the Queen would assist them, a spokesperson for the Duke of York confirmed that she &quot;will not be stepping in to settle the debt&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; reported in September 2021 that Sarah and Andrew had reached a legal agreement with the property&#x27;s previous owner, and would sell the house to pay back their debt. The owner agreed to receive £3.4 million, half of the amount that she was owed, as she had been under impression that Sarah and Andrew were dealing with financial troubles. In August 2022, it was reported that Sarah had purchased a £5 million townhouse in Mayfair after the success of her novel &quot;Her Heart for a Compass&quot;.

===Cash for access===
In May 2010, Sarah was filmed by the &quot;News of the World&quot; offering Mazher Mahmood, an undercover reporter posing as an Indian businessman, access to Prince Andrew for £500,000. On the video made as a documentary source for the story, which is publicly available, Sarah is heard to say, &quot;£500,000 when you can, to me, open doors&quot;. She is seen taking away a briefcase containing £40,000 in cash. Exposure surrounding the incident increased Sarah&#x27;s public profile and notoriety.

Sterling Publishers substantially increased the print run of &quot;Ashley Learns About Strangers&quot;, Sarah&#x27;s latest book for children; however, the notoriety did not translate into additional book sales. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, titled &quot;Oprah and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York&quot;, Sarah explained her behaviour by saying that she had been drinking prior to soliciting the cash, and was &quot;in the gutter at that moment&quot;. She also claimed that her intention was initially to help a friend who &quot;needed $38,000 (£28,000) urgently&quot; but she ultimately asked for more money due to her own financial problems.

In November 2016, it was reported that Sarah intended to sue News Group Newspapers (parent company of the &quot;News of the World&quot;) and its owner Rupert Murdoch for £25 million in damages citing her &quot;loss in earnings&quot; as well as the subsequent &quot;distress&quot; that the media sting brought to her as the main reasons. In January 2018, it was reported that the actual amount Sarah was seeking was £45 million.

In March 2022 it was reported that the wife of jailed Turkish politician İlhan İşbilen alleged that Sarah received at least £225,000 from businessman Selman Turk, whom Mrs İşbilen is suing for fraud. An additional £25,000 was sent by Turk in October 2019 to the bank account of Sarah&#x27;s younger daughter, Eugenie, the second instalment of which was referenced &quot;birthday gift&quot;, reportedly &quot;to pay for a surprise birthday party for the Duchess&quot;. Sarah was owed £225,000 by Pegasus Group Holdings for her role as brand ambassador, but she received the full amount from Turk, who was then set to reclaim the money from Pegasus.

===2012 Turkey legal incident===
On 13 January 2012, the Ministry of Justice of Turkey issued an international arrest warrant for Sarah. She had travelled to Turkey in 2008 and covertly filmed a Turkish state orphanage. The Turkish authorities alleged that Sarah made a false declaration when entering the country (in regard to her motives for visiting Turkey), trespassed into a Turkish Government institution, and also invaded the privacy of children. These charges carry sentences of up to 22 years imprisonment. Turkey and Britain have an extradition treaty; however, Home Office officials have stated:
Turkey maintains that Sarah distorted information about the orphanage and used an isolated incident in a smear campaign against the Republic of Turkey. Turkey invited international human rights organisations to inspect any orphanage of its choosing to show its transparency in relation to the issue.

On 5 May 2012, the trial began into the charges brought by the Ankara State Prosecutor&#x27;s office. Cansu Şahin, representing Ferguson, who was not present, told the Ankara court that her client has apologised and would like to plea-bargain with the prosecution.

===Health===
In June 2023, it was announced that Sarah had been diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer following a routine mammogram. She successfully underwent a single mastectomy at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital, and her doctors stated her prognosis as &quot;good&quot;. She also underwent reconstructive surgery following her mastectomy.

In January 2024, it was announced that Sarah had been diagnosed with malignant melanoma after having several moles removed for analysis.

==Charity work==
Since her marriage to Prince Andrew, and continuing after the divorce, Sarah has been involved with a number of charities.

In 1990, Sarah became patron of the Teenage Cancer Trust. She has since opened most of the charity&#x27;s various units, including those at Middlesex Hospital, University College London, St James&#x27;s University Hospital, Cardiff University Hospital and Royal Marsden Hospital. Sarah began her work with people suffering from motor neurone disease in the 1990s. In her capacity as patron of the Motor Neurone Disease Association, she promoted fundraising campaigns for research about the disease and later became president of the International Alliance for ALS. To help and support those affected by drug misuse, she joined therapy sessions at the Chemical Dependency Centre and was later made their patron. In 1993, Sarah founded Children in Crisis, a children&#x27;s charity focused on education and grant making to international programmes. Sarah serves as founder and life president. She founded the charity after meeting a young cancer victim named Ania during her visit to Poland in 1992.

In December 1994, Sarah went to the US to take part in a fundraising event for Peace Links and to launch her own charity, Chances for Children, in the US. Her decision to launch a fundraising event for her charity in the US was criticised by the British press, who claimed that through her &quot;Budgie the Little Helicopter&quot; series she was &quot;expected to earn 400 million pounds over the next five years, with 3 million pounds a year going into her royal pocket&quot; despite her promise to donate part of her earnings to charity. The claims were denied by Sarah&#x27;s representative, and she later responded to the criticism by saying, &quot;What you all must understand is that the Budgie books were produced in 1987. That&#x27;s when I gave a large percentage to charity. ... And maybe after costs, after the animation is made, after everything else and the popcorn and everything else, then perhaps in five to ten years, maybe I might receive a little bit of my percentage, and that I hope will be at that time going back into Chances for Children&quot;. &quot;Little Red&quot;, the doll that was used as a logo for her American charity, later inspired her to write a series of books named after the doll. The proceeds from selling the doll also went to Chances for Children.
In June 1998, Sarah made a brief trip to Bethesda to receive an award from the Journal of Women&#x27;s Health. She also visited the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. NIH associate director for communications said, &quot;The Duchess has many opportunities to talk to women via television, at lectures and through print media interviews&quot; and was interested &quot;in learning from NIH scientists what major health messages she should deliver to women, based on the research conducted through NIH.&quot; Sarah, whose elder daughter Beatrice was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of seven, became a patron of Springboard for Children, a charity that helps students who struggle with reading and writing. Sarah has also described herself as &quot;a little bit dyslexic&quot;.
In 2003, Sarah joined the American Cancer Society at a congressional briefing. She was a founding supporter of the American Cancer Society&#x27;s Great American Weigh In, an annual campaign (modelled after the Society&#x27;s Great American Smoke Out) aimed at raising awareness of the link between excess weight and cancer. In 2004, Sarah was named the official spokesperson of SOS Children&#x27;s Villages – USA and in 2005 she became a global ambassador for Ronald McDonald House Charities. In 2006, Sarah established The Sarah Ferguson Foundation based in Toronto, which derives funds from Sarah&#x27;s commercial work and private donations with the aim of supporting charities internationally that serve children and families in dire need. Included under this umbrella organisation is her patronage and support of several British charities, including Mental Disability Rights International, the African-Caribbean Leukaemia Trust, Tommy&#x27;s, the Motor Neurone Disease Association, and CARE International. In 2009, it was reported that despite its income of £250,000 over 18 months, the foundation had spent only £14,200 on grants, £6,300 of which was given to the charitable arm of a South African private game reserve owned by Sir Richard Branson, a friend of Sarah&#x27;s. Following the report, the foundation released a list that showed they spent around $400,000 on donations in 2008.

In 2007, Sarah joined the Advisory Council of the Ophelia Project, an American initiative aimed to support people dealing with relational and other non-physical forms of aggression. In 2008, Sarah became patron of Humanitas, a charity focused on providing children with education, healthcare and family support. In the same year, she became an ambassador for New York mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s anti-poverty campaign. In 2010, Sarah became a supporter of the Mullany Fund, whose aim is to support British students wishing to study medicine or physiotherapy. In 2011, Sarah became the global ambassador for Not For Sale, a charity focused on human slavery. In 2013, Sarah, along with her former husband, the Duke of York and their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, founded Key To Freedom, a business structure for women in vulnerable situations in India who can sell their wares through the British retailer Topshop. In 2014, Sarah was appointed an ambassador for the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London. In 2015, Sarah revealed her connection with India and polo when she attended as a chief guest of HVR Baroda Cup in New Delhi under the invitation of Harshavardhan Reddy, chairman of HVR Sports.
In 2016, Sarah collaborated with British contemporary artist Teddy McDonald and her daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, to create the first Royal contemporary painting. Titled Royal Love, it was painted on the lawn of Royal Lodge and features positive thoughts and quotes by Sarah and the princesses. The painting was exhibited in London at the Masterpiece Art Fair, Chelsea in June/July 2016 and later auctioned at private dinner. The proceeds from the sale of the painting were donated by McDonald to the charity Children in Crisis. British &quot;GQ&quot; magazine published an exclusive on the creation of the painting. In 2017, Sarah was joined by her daughter Eugenie to mark the second anniversary of the Teenage Cancer Trust unit at Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital. In the same year, she was named an ambassador for the British Heart Foundation.

On the 25th anniversary of Children in Crisis&#x27;s foundation in 2018, Sarah said that working with this charity &quot;gave her a sense of perspective and purpose during tough times&quot;. Sarah merged her charity foundation with Street Child, an organisation run by Tom Dannatt in Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, of which Sarah has become a patron, and her daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, are the ambassadors. Sarah is also a patron of Julia&#x27;s House, a children&#x27;s hospice in Corfe Mullen.

In June 2019, Sarah became the patron of Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, an organisation founded in honour of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died in 2016 due to an allergic reaction after consuming a sandwich. Sarah, whose own paternal uncle died following an allergic reaction, was asked by Ednan-Laperouse&#x27;s parents to become their charity&#x27;s patron. The organisation is working on a bill called &quot;Natasha&#x27;s Law&quot;, which &quot;requires all food businesses in England and Northern Ireland to list every ingredient in their pre-packaged foods&quot;. Later in July, she became an ambassador for the technology infrastructure company Pegasus Group Holdings. Sarah was chosen to initiate &quot;the company&#x27;s philanthropic endeavors&quot; as they develop an &quot;off-grid renewable energy data center&quot;.

In June 2020, Sarah launched her new charitable foundation called Sarah&#x27;s Trust. The charity has provided aid for NHS, care home and hospice staff by delivering more than 150,000 items, including food, masks, scrubs, and toiletries. Organisations such as Under One Sky and NOAH Enterprise have helped the foundation by giving sleeping bags to homeless people in the UK. Essentials and supplies have also been sent to Ghana. In March 2022, Sarah visited Denver after being chosen as the keynote speaker at a Junior League of Denver fundraiser. In the same month, she travelled to Poland amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine to meet with Ukrainian refugees and help her charity the Sarah&#x27;s Trust in organising goods donated by UK citizens. In the following month, she travelled to Albania and met Afghan refugees at a resort in Golem. In her capacity as chief ambassador of the Montessori Group, Sarah visited Croatia in June 2022 where she promoted the organisation&#x27;s work on providing help for Ukrainian refugees and supporting children. In July 2022, her charity secured money to fund £14,000-worth of computers for Ukrainian refugees in Poland. She also helped with setting up the &#x27;Play in a Box&#x27; tent in Upper Silesia to host refugee children for reading, playing, and baking. In December 2022, she hosted a choir for the blind from Kharkiv&#x27;s Special Training Educational Complex during their visit to the UK, for which she was awarded with a certificate and badge from Poland&#x27;s National Institute for the Blind.

In March 2024, Sarah co-chaired the Global Citizen NOW summit in Melbourne, Australia with the aim to end extreme poverty and address the climate crisis.

==Film and television career==

In 2000, Sarah co-produced and served as presenter in a documentary for BBC television called &quot;In Search of the Spirit&quot;. In September 2003, she was a co-host for three days on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s afternoon show &quot;Steve Wright&quot;. In May 2004, Sarah hosted an eleven-minute production featurette on Universal&#x27;s DVD &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, titled &quot;The Legacy of Pan&quot;. Five months later, Walt Disney Feature Animation released a DVD &quot;The Cat That Looked at a King&quot;, with Sarah&#x27;s voice in the role of the Queen; the story is derived from the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; books by P. L. Travers.

In 2008, Sarah was a special correspondent to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; for which she presented segments for a series called &quot;From the Heart&quot;. In May 2008, her two-part film &quot;The Duchess in Hull&quot; premiered on ITV1, showing Sarah helping a family on a council estate in Hull to improve their lifestyle. In the same year she travelled to Romania and Turkey for the documentary &quot;Duchess and Daughters: Their Secret Mission&quot;, shown on ITV1 on 6 November 2008, investigating poor treatment and conditions in children&#x27;s institutions in those two countries. In August 2009, her documentary &quot;The Duchess on the Estate&quot;, which was about Northern Moor, Manchester, was shown on the same network. Her report on the suburb area in Manchester caused criticism for exaggerating crime in the area.

Sarah had a producing role (credited as &quot;Sarah Ferguson&quot;) in the 2009 Jean-Marc Vallée film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;, starring Emily Blunt and featuring a background player role for Sarah&#x27;s daughter Princess Beatrice. It was Sarah who conceived the idea for a film based upon the early years of Queen Victoria. Since her marriage to Prince Andrew, she had been interested in the Queen, and had written two books about her with the help of a historian. The Victoria-Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen&#x27;s history, as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew, as they both &quot;fought for their love&quot; in the midst of public scrutiny.

Sarah had the leading role on &quot;Finding Sarah&quot;, a mini-series on Oprah Winfrey Network which premiered in June 2011. She talked about her struggles through life and financial issues in the show.

In 2019, Sarah said that she was producing a TV documentary about Prince Albert&#x27;s mother Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. The documentary will focus on her life, particularly her separation from her husband Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

In April 2020, Sarah launched a new series on her YouTube channel, called &quot;Storytime with Fergie and Friends&quot;, in which she and a number of authors, including Nanette Newman and Imogen Edwards-Jones, read stories to children from their homes during the lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. From March to July 2021, the same channel showed 10 short episodes of &quot;Little Red News&quot; featuring characters from Ferguson&#x27;s book series, &quot;Little Red&quot;.

In May 2022, she co-founded the independent production house Vestapol Films, which is based in Paris. In May 2023, she launched the weekly podcast &quot;Tea Talks with the Duchess &amp; Sarah&quot; together with Sarah Thomson, which premiered in June 2023.

According to various media outlets, Sarah called Fergie after the release of her album and remarked: &quot;Fergie, it&#x27;s Fergie...

<text>Kilpeck is a village and civil parish in the county of Herefordshire, England. It is about southwest of Hereford, just south of the A465 road and Welsh Marches Line to Abergavenny, and about from the border with Wales. On 1 April 2019, the parishes of Kenderchurch, St Devereux, Treville and Wormbridge were merged with Kilpeck.

The village is renowned for its small but outstanding Norman (Romanesque) church, SS Mary and David&#x27;s, but also has the earthworks of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle that is no longer standing. The church is a Grade I listed building. There is a public house called the Kilpeck Inn, formerly the Red Lion, situated in the centre of the village opposite the village green. Other amenities include a village hall and post office. 

==History==
Until the 9th century, when it was taken over by Mercia, the area around Kilpeck was within the Welsh kingdom of Ergyng. After the Norman conquest, the area became known as &quot;Archenfield&quot; and was governed as part of the Welsh Marches. It became part of Herefordshire, and England, in the 16th century, although the use of Welsh in the area remained strong until the 19th century. The English name for the village derives from the Welsh name, &quot;Llanddewi Kil Peddeg&quot;, with &quot;Llanddewi&quot; meaning &quot;church of St David&quot; and &quot;Cil Peddeg&quot; probably meaning the &quot;cell of Pedic&quot;, an otherwise unknown local early Christian hermit.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Kilpeck (entered as &quot;Chipeete&quot;) was given by William the Conqueror to William Fitz Norman de la Mare, son of Norman de la Mare. The clan de la Mare is one of the oldest in Normandy and is descended from Ragnvald Eysteinsson, earl of Møre and Romsdal. According to the Domesday survey, Kilpeck had &quot;3 ploughs, 2 serfs and 4 oxmen and there are 57 men with 19 ploughs.&quot; There are mentions of a church on the site possibly from as early as the 7th century. There are vestiges of an enclosure, 200 yds (183 metres) by 300 yds (274 m) in the field, defining an Anglo-Saxon village.

==Landmarks==

The St Mary and St David&#x27;s Church was built around 1140. It consists of a nave, chancel and semicircular apse. It is remarkable for its wealth of Norman stone carvings (and their fine state of preservation), both inside and out, all original both in form and position and incorporating many corbels with representations of human faces, hares, fish, fowl, stags etc. Eighty-five of 91 corbels survive, an extraordinarily high percentage.

West of the church lies a ruined motte and bailey with earthworks. The castle is thought to have been first built around 1090 as the administrative centre of Archenfield. A few walls of the 12th- or 13th-century keep still stand on top of the motte; these are not well preserved. A fireplace and chimney flues are visible, as are two sections of standing castle walls.

A little over a mile to the north is the surviving motte of another castle, at Didley Court Farm.
