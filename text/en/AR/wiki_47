<text>Alblasserdam () is a town and municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. It covers an area of , of which is water, and has a population of as of . Alblasserdam is officially a part of the Drechtsteden region. A portion of the small village of Kinderdijk, which boasts the largest and most famous concentration of windmills in the Netherlands, is part of Alblasserdam.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Alblasserdam&quot; is derived from its location near the creek Alblas where a dam was built. Inhabitants of Alblasserdam are called &quot;Alblasserdammers&quot; (singular: &quot;Alblasserdammer&quot;).

==History==

=== 13th-19th century ===
The town of Alblasserdam was first mentioned in the chronicles of Melis Stoke in 1299, but the municipality wasn&#x27;t formed until 1447. Before that, it was part of Oud-Alblas.

Because of its location on the Noord river, one of the busiest waterways in Western Europe, water has played a major role in Alblasserdam&#x27;s history. The river was important for its development and makes it an advantageous location for industry. Alblasserdam&#x27;s strategic location also brought it negative consequences. For example, between 1350 and 1821, the Alblasserwaard polder flooded 32 times.

===20th century===
During World War I, mayor Simon Berman and the local government of Alblasserdam kept busy with 60 Belgian refugees within the municipal boundaries. An ad hoc municipal fund for the unemployed was established.

Alblasserdam suffered during the German raid on Rotterdam on 11 May 1940, when its town centre was severely damaged. The historic Kerkstraat (Church Street) and the characteristic dike construction along the river, however, were spared. 
The invaders placed the Netherlands under German occupation.

The North Sea flood of 1953 also affected a portion of Alblasserdam. The Delta Works program included reinforcements to the dikes and improvement of the locks. Therefore, water no longer poses a direct danger to Alblasserdam. 
In 1987, the custom yacht builder Oceanco started building yachts in the 80 metre+ range.

In 1999 the town celebrated its 700th anniversary.

===21st century===
Bert Blase served as mayor from 1999 to 2014, when he was appointed as mayor of Vlaardingen. Subsequently, the mayor of Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, Jan Heijkoop, also acted as mayor Alblasserdam. On 1 July 2015 Jaap Paans became mayor of Alblasserdam.

Both villages have a metro station on Rotterdam Metro line D (Poortugaal station and Rhoon station), which connect them to Rotterdam and to the main railway network from Rotterdam Centraal in the east, and to Hoogvliet and Spijkenisse in the west.

<text>Alphen aan den Rijn (; or &quot;Alphen on the Rhine&quot;) is a city and municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The city is situated on the banks of the river Oude Rijn (Old Rhine), where the river Gouwe branches off. The municipality had a population of in , and covers an area of of which is water.

The municipality of Alphen aan den Rijn also includes the communities of Aarlanderveen, Zwammerdam, and Boskoop. The city is located in what is called the &#x27;Green Heart&#x27; of the Netherlands, which is a somewhat less densely populated centre area of the Randstad.

The name &quot;Alphen&quot; is probably derived from the name of the Roman fort &quot;Albaniana&quot;, meaning &quot;settlement at the white water&quot;. Its remains still lie underneath the city centre.

== History ==
The area around Alphen aan den Rijn has been inhabited for 2000 years. In the Roman era, the Oude Rijn was the main branch of the Rhine River and formed the north border of the Roman Empire. Since the rule of Emperor Claudius (41–54 AD), divisions of the Roman army were stationed here. Consequently, several Roman fortifications were located along the Oude Rijn, including castellum &quot;Albanianae&quot; in the centre of Alphen. The Romans had also built the first bridge over the Oude Rijn. Alphen was therefore an important commercial site in the area until Germanic raids ended that in 240 AD.

After recurring problems with flooding, especially in Utrecht and Leiden, the Oude Rijn was dammed at Wijk bij Duurstede in 1122, thereby making the Lek River the main branch of the Rhine. The Oude Rijn has not flooded since. During the Middle Ages, Alphen was a fiefdom called Alphen en Rietveld.
In the 17th century, Alphen became prominent again as a hub for commerce. The Oude Rijn was used for boat traffic; there are still portions along the river where the towpath is present.

The current municipality was formed in 1918 through the amalgamation of the smaller municipalities of Alphen, Aarlanderveen, and Oudshoorn. In 1964, the municipality of Zwammerdam was added as well. In 2014 the municipalities of Boskoop and Rijnwoude were amalgamated as well, doubling the land area and increasing the population to over 100,000.

During the Second World War, the majority of Jews from Alphen were deported and subsequently murdered; only a few survived. After the war, the Jewish congregation was disbanded and merged with the one in Leiden. A Jewish cemetery on the Aarkade was founded in 1802, but it was abandoned and razed in the 1960s, with the remains re-interred in Katwijk; in 2012, after fifteen years of community activism by local historian Anke Bakker and CDA council member Alice Besseling, a monument was installed and the area turned into a city park.

Since the 1950s, the city began to grow rapidly. A large new neighbourhood was built on the north side and Alphen became mostly a commuter city. Other urban developments however did create local employment. Since the 1990s, a similar new development was built at the city&#x27;s south side.


In recent years, a large part of the city centre has undergone a full urban renewal. Many buildings from the 1950s and earlier have been demolished to make place for modern architecture. This &quot;masterplan&quot; included the addition of a new public square next to the riverbank, the construction of a performing arts theatre/cinema, an upgrade of local shops and the creation of pedestrian streets. As of 2006, all of these projects on the left riverbank &quot;Hoge Zijde&quot; have been finished and a new similar masterplan for the right riverbank &quot;Lage Zijde&quot; has been developed and is being executed now.

On 9 April 2011, a gunman opened fire at a shopping centre in Alphen aan den Rijn, killing six people and subsequently taking his own life.

On 3 August 2015, a newly built bridge flap of the under-renovation Juliana Bridge on the Oude Rijn collapsed. It was being hoisted by two cranes, different in size, floating on a pontoon that was not stabilized. It became unbalanced shortly after the lifting started, fell and collapsed onto buildings. There were no injuries and fatalities, many inhabitants having already cleared the area. In total 51 properties were damaged.

<text>Barendrecht () is a town and municipality in the west of the Netherlands, near Rotterdam, South Holland. The municipality had a population of in , and covers an area of of which is water.

The municipality of Barendrecht also includes Barendrecht-Carnisselande and Smitshoek.

==History==
The name &quot;Barendrecht&quot; is derived from the Germanic word &quot;birni&quot;, translated as &quot;mud&quot; or &quot;muddy&quot;, and the Latin word &quot;trāiectum&quot; translated as &quot;to cross (a river)&quot; to denote a muddy river crossing.

The current municipality of Barendrecht is located in the area of three former fiefdoms: East-Barendrecht, West-Barendrecht, and Carnisse. The oldest reference to East-Barendrecht is from 1264. These fiefdoms were in Riederwaard, an area reclaimed from water since the 12th century but had to deal with frequent dike breaches throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. Further stages in land reclamation, constituting the major part of modern Barendrecht, were the Binnenland polder (1484), Buitenland polder (1555) and Zuidpolder (1649).

During the French Period, the three fiefdoms were merged into one municipality Barendrecht. After the French Period, it was split into East and West-Barendrecht, but in 1836 it was again united as one municipality.

==Demographics==

The population of Barendrecht increased ten-fold in the last 80 years from just under 5,000 in 1930 to close to 50,000 in 2010. During this time the number of homes increased as well, there was an eight-fold increase in the number of homes in the last 50 years from 2,200 in 1961 to 18,400 in 2011. The overall population increased, whereas the number of persons per household decreased. This is consistent with the general trend in the Netherlands over this period.

In 2021, Barendrecht had a population of 48,771, of which 23,231 were male (49.4%) and 23,825 female (50.6%). According to the civil registry, 21% of its population were under the age of 14, 11% were between 15 and 24 years old, 27% were from 25 to 44, 28% were from 45 to 64 and 13% were 65 years of age or older. The marital status of the municipality was distributed such that 46% of its population was married, 45% never married, 6% divorced and 4% widowed. 26,08% of the population of Barendrecht was from foreign origin. The foreign origin of the municipality was 7,99% Western, 4% Suriname, 3% Turkey, 2% Morocco, 1% Dutch Caribbean and 8,81% from other countries.

Barendrecht had 18,615 households in 2012, this corresponds to an average of 2.5 persons per household. Of these households, 24% were made up of individuals, 30% were couples with no children under 18 living with them and 45% contained children under 18.

===Subdivisions===
Municipalities are the lowest tier of public administration in the Netherlands. They are, however, further subdivided into districts (&quot;wijken&quot;) and neighbourhoods (&quot;buurten&quot;) for administrative use. Barendrecht is subdivided into 23 districts, of which 20 are residential, two rural and one all business parks combined. The latter three have the lowest population density and largest area of all districts. The district with the highest population is Meerwede in Vinex-location Carnisselande, this district also has the highest population density. Each district is further subdivided in neighbourhoods. Some district consist of one neighbourhood, others consist of up to 14 neighbourhoods; the rural and business park districts are subdivided the most. The smallest neighbourhood has a size of , the largest spans . Some neighbourhoods are unpopulated; the largest population density for a neighbourhood in Barendrecht is .

==Sports==
Barendrecht is home to two football clubs; BVV Barendrecht, which plays at the fourth level of the Dutch football pyramid, and VV Smitshoek which plays at the fifth tier of the football pyramid. BVV Barendrecht won the KNVB Amateur Cup in the 2008–09 season, they were banned from the 2011–12 KNVB Cup after winning their first round matchup. In addition to these clubs there are also numerous other sport clubs, including organized badminton, basketball, handball, hockey, korfball, tennis, track and field, volleyball and water polo. Due to its proximity to Rotterdam, Barendrecht occasionally is the scene for road events starting or finishing in Rotterdam, it is the penultimate municipality on the route of the annual Paris-Rotterdam relay run.

Athletes from Barendrecht have also had individual success, mostly notably quadruple Olympic swimming champion Inge de Bruijn. She won four gold medals, two silver medals and two bronze medals in the freestyle and butterfly events at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. During her career she won a total of 36 medals in major competitions, 18 of these medals were gold. She has also held three world records in long course swimming. Several players on the Dutch water polo teams during the 1984 and 2000 Summer Olympics were from Barendrecht as well.

== Government ==
Barendrecht, as all Dutch municipalities, is ruled by both a board of mayor and aldermen and a municipal council. The municipal council is elected every four years. The number of councillors varies over time due to changes in the municipal population. It is the highest administrative body in the municipality and controls public policy. The executive power lies with the executive board, which consists of a mayor and multiple aldermen. The mayor is appointed by the crown and the alderman are elected by the municipal council, typically after each municipal election. Thieu van de Wouw, member of the CDA party, was major of Barendrecht from 1989 to his retirement in 2005. Jan van Belzen was appointed as mayor in July 2005, Van Belzen was mayor of Graafstroom before taking the same function in Barendrecht. In 2011 Van Belzen was appointed for another six-year term as mayor. The municipal council has traditionally been contested by national parties, the first local party was founded for the 2014 elections. The local representation per party typically changed with the national fortunes of these parties. The municipal elections of 2014 had the following results: the local party Our Interest Barendrecht won nine out of 29 seats, Christian Democratic Appeal won the largest share of the popular vote of all national parties in that election. Our Interest Barendrecht won also the elections of 2018 but did not participate in the local government. They also won the elections of 2022, but this time they are the only party governing the municipality.

Most policy decisions by the municipality do not garner widespread attention. Barendrecht is faced with the same issues as other suburban municipalities in providing public services and managing land-use planning. To study industrial scale carbon capture and storage methods, large-scale demonstration projects have been suggested to study what happens – the safety and other effects can only be fully studied in large-scale experiments. In 2007 it was suggested to inject of carbon dioxide underground in former gas fields in Barendrecht. Earlier studies had suggested to avoid trials in densely populated areas, such as Barendrecht, to eliminate the risk of a repeat of the Lake Nyos disaster. The suggestion to make Barendrecht a test site was met with local criticism, because of the experimental nature of the plan and because no ongoing monitoring of the fields would be performed. The municipal council of Barendrecht rejected the plan in June 2009 after their concerns were not met. The central government initially opted to overrule the council; they reversed their opinion in October 2010 and cancelled the plan.

==Infrastructure==
===Road===
Two Dutch motorways pass through Barendrecht:

* The A15 runs west to east along the northern part of the town and is part of the Rotterdam ring road. Its exit at &quot;IJsselmonde&quot; is located in the north-east of Barendrecht.
* The A29 runs north to south and divides Smitshoek and Carnisselande from the rest of Barendrecht. Its exit at &quot;Barendrecht&quot; is located in the south of the municipality. South of Barendrecht, it passes through the Heinenoordtunnel under the Oude Maas.

Vaanplein, the interchange between the A15 and A29, is situated within the borders of Barendrecht.

===Rail===
A number of railways pass through Barendrecht:

* The Breda–Rotterdam railway, originally known as &quot;Staatslijn I&quot; when it opened in 1872, runs along the east side of Barendrecht. The Barendrecht railway station is located on this line; it was initially opened in 1872 before moving to its current location in 2001.
* The HSL-Zuid is the high-speed rail line between Amsterdam and the Belgium border passing through Rotterdam. The southern section of the dedicated line branches off from the conventional line just north of Barendrecht and runs parallel to it through the town, but trains do not stop.
* The Betuweroute, a double track freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, runs along the north and eastern sides of Barendrecht, at one point paralleling the passenger line and HSL-Zuid. Queen Beatrix opened this route in 2007.

The nine tracks of all three of these lines, which run through the railway station, are covered over a length of 1.5 km (0.9 mi) to reduce the noise to the surrounding neighbourhoods. Nederlandse Spoorwegen services the station, with trains departing towards Dordrecht to the southeast and Rotterdam to the northwest four times an hour during the day during weekdays, reduced to two times an hour during the rest of the railways&#x27; normal service hours.

A major junction between the three railway lines north of the station was the site of a train accident in 2009. Two freight trains collided head on, killing one of the drivers and serious injuring another. A passenger train could not stop in time and collided with the wreckage.
===Local public transit===
As a suburb of Rotterdam, commuters in Barendrecht have access to extensive local transport services operated by RET, whose tram line 25 runs north-south through the western part of Barendrecht with its southern terminus in Carnisselande. The tram runs to the Rotterdam Centraal railway station through the city centre and beyond to its northern terminus in Schiebroek.

The RET also operates several bus lines through Barendrecht:

* three lines, via different routes, from the railway station to Zuidplein,
* a line from the railway station to Kralingse Zoom,
* a short local route from Zuidplein to the Barendrecht community of Smitshoek, and
* another short line departing from the east side of the railway station.

<text>Bergschenhoek () is a town and former municipality in the municipality of Lansingerland, in the province of South Holland, Netherlands. It is situated roughly 10 km to the north of Rotterdam. The town had a population of 18,475 in 2019, and covered an area of of which is water. On 1 January 2007, the town was merged with neighbouring towns Berkel en Rodenrijs and Bleiswijk to form the new municipality Lansingerland; these three towns collectively are known locally as the &quot;3B Hoek&quot;.

Due to the continuing influx of people to Bergschenhoek, it is in a constant state of expansion and is now predominantly a commuter town as most of its residents work in the neighbouring cities, such as The Hague and Rotterdam. The town had a large population increase since 1990, because of the Vinex-plans. The town grew from 7,600 inhabitants in 1990 to nearly 18,500 in 2019.

The name of the town is derived from a district of the nearby city of Rotterdam, Hillegersberg. There was a road leading to this municipality. On a corner of this road (&#x27;hoek&#x27; in Dutch) a settlement grew, leading to a village. This village was named after Hillegersberg, and the corner was incorporated in the name, hence the name (Hillegers)Bergschenhoek.

<text>Bodegraven () is a town and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The former municipality covers an area of of which is water.

The former municipality of Bodegraven also includes the communities Meije, and Nieuwerbrug.

On January 1, 2011, Bodegraven merged with Reeuwijk to Bodegraven-Reeuwijk.

==Geography==
Bodegraven is centrally located in the Green Heart of the Randstad, roughly equally distant (about 30 km) from Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. It is surrounded by the municipalities (clockwise, starting in the north): Nieuwkoop, Woerden, Reeuwijk (former municipality), Boskoop, and Alphen aan den Rijn.

The town is situated on both shores of the Oude Rijn, in which a set of locks are in the middle of town. The oldest part of town is the Reformed St. Gallus Church, on the north side of the river.

==History==
Bodegraven was already inhabited in the Roman Era. It was situated at the Roman Empire&#x27;s northern border, the Limes Germanicus. As such, many army camps, ports, and roads were built by the Romans. Many settlements originated on the road along the Limes, including Bodegraven.

Not much is known about Bodegraven after that. According to folklore, a lost map from 809 made reference to a fiefdom &quot;Bodelo&quot;. There is certainty however that circa 1050 a small settlement had formed, probably near the current Dorpskerk (Village Church). After two centuries of dispute between the bishop of Utrecht and the Counts of Holland, Bodegraven eventually became part of Holland.

In the late Middle Ages, large tracts of land around Bodegraven were prepared for cultivation by digging division ditches (&quot;kavelsloten&quot;) perpendicular to the rivers (such as Oude Rijn, Meije, and Oude Bodegrave) between land parcels and then ditches cross-wise some from and parallel to the rivers (&quot;achtersloten&quot;). This created the distinctive grid pattern of field divisions. Circa 1350, a lock was built at Bodegraven.

In 1672 when war was declared between the Dutch Republic and England, France, Münster, and Cologne, Bodegraven was just behind the Water Defense Line. The Water Line was inundated and formed a barrier to the advancing French troops. But during the winter the French could advance over the frozen polders to Meije and Zwammerdam. Before reaching Alphen aan den Rijn they could be repelled by the Dutch. Thaw had set in so the only retreat route was along the dike of the Oude Rijn. The French therefore came through Bodegraven and destroyed it. Afterwards, the fort Wierickerschans was built just east of the town.
Until 1870 Bodegraven prospered. But in that year fire broke out in a bakery which subsequently burnt a large part of the town. In all a 100 homes had burnt down and 130 families were homeless. A national collection was held and the town quickly recovered.

In the 20th century, Bodegraven expanded: the southside between the Oude Rijn and the railway was built up circa 1900, the northside between the World Wars, and since the 1950s the area between the railway and the A12 Motorway has been built up.

==Economy==
Bodegraven is known as a centre for the cheese trade, controlled by the powerful Goebel family, though the number of cheese warehouses has decreased and, the Tuesday Cheese Market is no longer held since 2001. There still is a cheese museum and a cheese monument in front of the church.

It was also known for its shampoo because of the Andrélon Factory, founded in the 1940s by barber André de Jong. In 2005 the factory closed and was demolished.

Bodegraven has a strategic location in the middle of the Green Heart, resulting in a relative high number of industries located here.

There is a picturesque historic windmill located in the town, which dates from the late seventeenth century and is now known as &quot;De Arkduif&quot; (the &#x27;ark-dove&#x27; of the biblical Noah&#x27;s Ark story). This currently houses a small brewery called Brouwerij De Molen.

==Transportation==
The A12 Motorway, running next to Bodegraven, connects The Hague via Utrecht and Arnhem to the German border. The State Highway N11 connects the A12 with the A4 Motorway at Leiden.

===Railway===
Railway Station: Bodegraven. There is a train between Leiden and Utrecht stopping in Bodegraven, four times an hour.

===Bus===
There is only one bus (Line 178) in Bodegraven, connecting it with Reeuwijk and Gouda. A local bus (Line 724) drives between the communities Bodegraven, Zwammerdam, De Meije, Zegveld, Woerden, Nieuwerbrug, and back to Bodegraven. A second local bus (Line 722) connects Alphen aan den Rijn and Bodegraven via Zwammerdam. A steam tram formerly ran between Bodegraven and Gouda. Between 1892 and 1917 it used horses instead of steam locomotives.

<text>Boskoop () is a town in the province of South Holland. It was a separate municipality until it merged into Alphen aan den Rijn in 2014. The town had a population of 15,050 in 2012 and covers an area of of which is water. It&#x27;s the world&#x27;s biggest joined floriculture area.

Boskoop is famous for its nurseries, particularly woody plant and perennial nurseries, of which some 774 are situated on long stretches of land, divided by narrow canals. Before World War II almost all transport was conducted using narrow boats. A few exceptionally high footbridges crossing some of the broader (main) canals remain from these days. Between the World Wars the transition was made from fruit culture to decorative garden plants and trees. As a source of technical knowledge about the art of growing decorative plants, Boskoop remains world-renowned and unique.

The name &quot;Boskoop&quot; has been given to an apple cultivar (Belle de Boskoop) which is widely distributed in the Low Countries, to a grape variety (&quot;Boskoop Glory&quot;) and also to a variety of Calluna (&quot;Boskoop&quot;) and Weigela (&quot;Boskoop Glory&quot;) and blackcurrant (&quot;Boskoop Giant&quot;).

==Geography==
Boskoop is located in the Green Heart (nl: Groene Hart) of the Randstad, spanning both sides of the river Gouwe between Alphen aan den Rijn (to the north) and Waddinxveen (to the south), both also along the river. The municipality is bordered in the east by Reeuwijk and Bodegraven, and in the west by Rijnwoude. A vertical-lift bridge in the centre of the village connects both shores of the Gouwe.

==History==
It is assumed that Boskoop originated from the settlement &quot;Ten Bussche&quot;, founded by William I, Count of Holland, in 1204. In 1222, the Abbey of Rijnsburg became owner of Boskoop. The Abbey decided to enlarge its tree and shrub inventory by making the farmers grow more trees than they would need for their own orchards. From the 15th to the 17th century more and more trees were produced and decorative plants were introduced. At the end of the 19th century, Boskoop began with the export of its products, Germany being its first client.

The history of Boskoop was greatly influenced by its location on top of a thick peat layer. When the Abbey of Rijnsburg became owners of Boskoop, the harvesting of peat for fuel began. But unlike other towns in the &quot;Green Heart&quot; where extensive peat harvesting led to the formation of large ponds and lakes, Boskoop was too far from the major cities and peat harvesting was not profitable. Also the abbey did not permit the excavation of the peat layer on its lands. So Boskoop still has fertile soil for agriculture and horticulture.

An obstacle to the arboriculture was the high groundwater level, which was just below the surface at Boskoop. Many canals and ditches were dug to drain the rain waters, up to 2000 km at one point in its history. Consequently, much transportation was done by means of these waterways. By introducing new drainage methods which lowered the groundwater level, many ditches could be filled again. Yet at the beginning of the 21st century, there are still many canals in Boskoop on which many nurseries rely for transportation. As a result, Boskoop is sometimes called &quot;Small Giethoorn&quot;. Nowadays, most plants are grown directly in pots, as opposed to open ground, and shipped to auction directly from the nursery. The viability of the nursery industry in Boskoop is also at risk, as nursery production has switched to container production, as opposed to field growing. The small size of the nurseries, the inability to mechanize, government regulations, the high cost of land, and the high cost of labor have all increased the economic pressure on the Boskoop nursery industry.

The municipality of Boskoop had been in financial straits for the several years, in part because of the high cost of maintaining the constantly sinking roads, before it was amalgamated into Alphen aan den Rijn. On 1 January 2014 the municipality was merged into Alphen aan den Rijn at the same time as Rijnwoude. When it was dissolved, the municipality had a population of 15,196 and a total area of .

==Transport==
Boskoop is served by Boskoop railway station, which is in the west part of town. In 2017, Boskoop Snijdelwijk railway station was opened. Boskoop is connected to the RijnGouweLijn, which runs from Alphen aan den Rijn to Gouda. Trains travel every thirty minutes in either direction. In peak hours, an additional two trains travel every hour in the directions of Gouda and Leiden.

==Attractions==
The vertical-lift bridge at Boskoop is one of three similar bridges over the Gouwe; the other two are in Alphen aan den Rijn and Waddinxveen. Because of its central location, the bridge characterizes the village skyline. A new bicycle path was added to the bridge during its renovation at the beginning of the 1990s.

Another historic building is the (now partially dismantled) Water Tower of Boskoop. It is located on the north-east side of the village on the same road crossing the lift bridge.

Near the train station is an extensive rose garden (rosarium), with free access and open the whole year. More than 160 types of roses are exhibited here together with numerous other shrubs, trees, and plants.

In view of its history, it is not surprising Boskoop has a nursery museum. It is located in an old nursery residence from 1870. Behind the museum is another rose garden with rose varieties from the 17th to the 20th century.

From spring to fall, boat tours are organized through the many canals of Boskoop, which tour along the nurseries and nature areas and provide information about the history and surroundings of Boskoop. And once per year, a nursery canoe tour is organized.

<text>Brielle (), also called Den Briel in Dutch and Brill in English, is a town and historic seaport in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland, on the north side of the island of Voorne-Putten, at the mouth of the New Maas. The former municipality covered an area of of which was water. In its population was .

The former municipality of Brielle also included the communities of Vierpolders and Zwartewaal.

On 1 January 2023, the municipality of Brielle merged with Hellevoetsluis and Westvoorne into the new municipality of Voorne aan Zee.

Brielle, New Jersey was named after Brielle by the Dutch colonists of New Jersey, originally New Netherland.

==History==

Brielle is a very old, fortified town. Its name is derived from the Celtic word &quot;brogilo&quot; (meaning &quot;closed area&quot; or &quot;hunting grounds&quot;). The oldest writings about Brielle indicate that the current location is the &quot;new&quot; Brielle. &quot;Den ouden Briel&quot; (Old Brill) must have been situated somewhere else on the Voorne-Putten Island. It grew into a town of prestige in the 14th century. In 1330, Gerard van Voorne, independent Lord of Voorne and Viscount of Zeeland, granted town rights to Brielle. This gave the town governmental and jurisdictional powers and certain trading rights, such as the right to trade fish and collect port taxes. The town was for a long time the seat of the Lords of Voorne, until this fiefdom was added to the County of Holland in 1371. It had its own harbour and traded with the countries around the Baltic Sea. Brielle even had its own trading colony in Sweden.
During the Eighty Years&#x27; War between the Netherlands and Spain, the Capture of Brielle on April 1, 1572, by Protestant rebels, the Watergeuzen, marked a turning point in the conflict, as many towns in Holland then began to support William of Orange against the Spanish Duke Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba who was sent to pacify The Netherlands. This event is still celebrated each year on April 1 and the night before (known as Chalk Night (kalknacht) when the town is defaced with chalk - and now also white paint). Dutch students are taught a short rhyme to remember this fact, which rhyme refers to April Fools&#x27; Day:

In Dutch, &quot;de bril&quot; is the word for &quot;the glasses,&quot; and closely rhymes with Den Briel; as does &quot;Fles&quot; which stands for the town of Vlissingen or Flushing, the next town to be captured by the Dutch rebels.

After the capture of Brielle the Protestant rebels tortured and murdered the Catholic Martyrs of Gorkum and Brielle has become a pilgrimage location since then.

In August 1585, Brielle was one of the three Dutch towns that became an English possession by the Treaty of Nonsuch when Queen Elizabeth I received it as security of payment for 5000 soldiers (led by the Earl of Leicester) and used by the Dutch in their struggle against the Spanish. The first English governor of Brielle was Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, succeeded by Edward Conway, 1st Viscount Conway who named his daughter Brilliana in honour of the town. English garrisons were stationed here and at Flushing. Edmund Sheffield, 3rd Baron Sheffield governed the town from 1598. In 1617, these cities returned to the Netherlands.

<doc id="121111" wikidata="Q1975464" url="?curid=121111" title="Fergus Falls, Minnesota">
<text>Fergus Falls ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Otter Tail County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 14,119 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The falls from which the city gets part of its name were discovered by Joe Whitford (a Scottish trapper) in 1856 and promptly named in honor of his employer, James Fergus. It is not known whether Fergus ever visited the city, but Whitford did not live to see the city develop, as he was killed during the 1862 Dakota war in western Minnesota. In 1867, George B. Wright was at the land office at St. Cloud and found Whitford&#x27;s lapsed claim, purchased the land, and built what is now the Central Dam in downtown Fergus Falls around 1871. After Wright died in 1882, his son Vernon moved from Boston to Minnesota and took over his father&#x27;s interests in the town. Vernon Wright was also one of the two people who established the Otter Tail Power Company in 1907. The city was incorporated in the late 1870s and is situated along the dividing line between the former great deciduous forest of the Northwest Territories to the east and the great plains to the west, in a region of gentle hills, where the recent geological history is dominated by the recession of the glaciers from the last great Ice Age, with numerous lakes and small rivers.

Two major tornadoes hit Fergus Falls during the early 20th century, the second, the 1919 Fergus Falls tornado, being the greater. The only church edifice left standing after the great cyclone was the predominantly black Baptist church.

===21st century===
Fergus Falls features different parks, including tallgrass prairie and eastern woodlands, stores, and other tourist attractions. The Union Avenue Bridge spans the Otter Tail River, and was reconstructed in 2004. Just below the bridge is part of scenic River Walk Park, which spans about a mile of the river. The part nearest the Union Avenue Bridge was redone along with the bridge. The town hall was modeled after Independence Hall in Philadelphia. Its west wing housed the city fire station until the 1970s. Other points of interest include the county museum, Lake Alice, George B. Wright Park, Pebble Lake Golf Course, and Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Park. Arts in Fergus Falls are booming with a community theater program downtown. Many local and professional artists perform at A Center for the Arts.

The city also lends its name to the song &quot;Fergus Falls&quot; by the band Field Report on its 2012 self-titled album.

Fergus Falls received international coverage in early 2017 and late 2018 after a news article in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; falsely claimed there was an anti-Mexican sign at the city&#x27;s entrance and fabricated other things about the town. The story&#x27;s author, Claas Relotius, admitted to numerous instances of journalistic fraud. In December 2018 two residents of Fergus Falls, Michele Anderson and Jake Krohn, published a report pointing out the &quot;11 most absurd lies&quot; of the 2017 article. The same month &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; also sent a reporter to Fergus Falls to investigate and apologize.

===Ethnicity===
A strong economic division between later Scandinavian immigrant farmers and the earlier English and Scottish war veterans who retained control of the principal businesses of the city center, the banks, and the increasingly important Otter Tail Power Company, persisted for decades until several generations of ethnic intermarriage and continuing inward and outward migration largely erased the divisions along ethnic lines. The small black community, largely Baptist, which clustered in the Southeast section of the city, gradually dwindled as people departed for larger cities.

===Growth===

The dams built on the Otter Tail River beginning in the 1880s were powerful economic forces that shaped the area&#x27;s development. Returning soldiers from the American Civil War settled in the region, mostly as farmers (wheat and corn in the western plains and dairy and hogs in the eastern hills and forests). The importance of the Civil War experience to these early settlers is highlighted by the town&#x27;s street names: the intersecting principal thoroughfares are Lincoln Avenue and Union Avenue. The oldest parts of the town have streets with names such as Sherman, Sheridan, and Vernon. The early English wave of settlement claimed control of the falls along the Otter Tail River and established the first Episcopalian and Presbyterian churches.
===Immigration===

Almost as soon as the foundational structure of the town was laid, an influx of Norwegian immigrants arrived, by way of the Scandinavian migration of Chicago and Minneapolis, often on the Great Northern Railway. Primarily dairy farmers, they established numerous Lutheran churches in the area. The Lutheran Brethren (Church of the Lutheran Brethren of America) established an academy in Fergus Falls, which today operates a private high school, theological seminary and mission society, with an office in Fergus Falls. The pietistic, low-church Lutherans constituted one cultural center of the Norwegian-German community, while the high-church First Lutheran constituted a separate center, which attracted a more upwardly mobile class of parishioner.

===Population growth and loss===
After the Interstate Defense Highway System built Interstate 94 along the western edge of Fergus Falls in the late 1950s, population mobility increased dramatically, and high school graduates increasingly left the town to attend colleges in Morris, Fargo-Moorhead, or the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. As farming declined as an occupation and lifestyle, with large-scale commercial farming gradually replacing the family farm system during the second half of the 20th century, the city appeared increasingly destined to become a retirement and nursing community until a new migration of younger remote workers moved to the city. The bucolic environment, with abundant sporting opportunities that had long attracted summer vacationers. The relatively low cost of real estate, cost of living, and a variety of public school locations has also attracted families to the city.

The song was written from her perspective.&quot; The song has received critical acclaim.

<text>Dirksland () is a village and former municipality on Goeree-Overflakkee Island in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The former municipality had a population of about 8,000 in 2007, and covered an area of about 74 km2 of which about 19 km2 was water. The former municipality of Dirksland also included the communities of Herkingen, and Melissant. On 1 January 2013, Dirksland merged with Goedereede, Middelharnis, and Oostflakkee into the new municipality of Goeree-Overflakkee.

The North Sea flood of 1953 did not have as much of a destructive effect on Dirksland as the rest of the island, because Dirksland is somewhat higher. Dirksland is the largest of the three communities within the former municipality and also has the only hospital on Goeree-Overflakkee island. The Van Weel-Bethesda Hospital is one of the smallest in the country, but has an excellent reputation. Dirksland can be recognized from a distance by the tallest water tower in the country. The towns are agriculturally focused and have several campgrounds for people who prefer a bit of rest over the busy Ouddorp area but still want to be close to shore. Dirksland has an inland harbor with a newly restored gate complex.

<text>Goedereede () is a little city and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The former municipality had a population of about 11,000 in 2010. It consisted of the west part of the island of Goeree-Overflakkee. Goedereede merged with Dirksland, Middelharnis, and Oostflakkee into the new municipality of Goeree-Overflakkee on January 1, 2013. The town have a population of about 2,000 in 2012.

Goedereede received city rights in 1312 from Sir Gereart van Voorne.

The future Pope Adrian VI (1459–1523) was at one time pastor of the parish church of Goedereede. During a great fire in Goedereede in 1482 the old &quot;Katharina Church&quot; and its tower were destroyed.

A new church was erected in 1512 beside the Toren van Goedereede (Goederede Tower), which still stands today.

Goederede went into a long decline, losing trade to better-sited ports. There were insufficient funds to maintain the church. In 1706 the dilapidated building was pulled down, but the tower was preserved.

The former municipality of Goedereede also included the communities of, from west to east, Ouddorp, Goedereede (with Havenhoofd), Oostdijk, and Stellendam.

<text>Gorinchem ( ), also spelled Gorkum, is a city and municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The municipality covers an area of of which is water. It had a population of in .

The municipality of Gorinchem also includes the population centre of Dalem.

== History ==

It is generally assumed that Gorinchem was founded 1000 AD by fishermen and farmers on the raised land near the mouth of the river Linge at the Merwede. &quot;Goriks Heem&quot; (&quot;Home of Gorik&quot; in early Middle Dutch) is first mentioned in a document from 1224 in which Floris IV granted people from Gorinchem exemption of toll payments throughout Holland.

Somewhere between 1247 and 1267, Gorinchem became property of the Lords of Arkel. At the end of the 13th century earthen mounds reinforced with palisades were built around the settlement to protect it from domination by the neighboring counties of Holland and Gelre. Half a century later real city walls were built complete with 7 gates and 23 watchtowers. Otto van Arkel granted it city rights on 11 November 1322.

Jan van Arkel had a dispute with Albert I, brother of Willem V of Holland, leading to war and subsequently to the annexation of Gorinchem to Holland in 1417. This resulted in increased trade and Gorinchem grew to be the eighth city of Holland.

Charles the Bold constructed the Blue Tower palace in Gorinchem in 1461. This castle was already demolished in 1578.

On 9 July 1572, the Watergeuzen (Dutch rebels against Spanish rule) conquered the city and captured 19 Catholic priests and monks. Because they refused to renounce their faith, these priests and monks were brought to Brielle where they were hanged and were from then on known among Catholics as the Martyrs of Gorkum.

The Martyrs of Gorkum were canonized by Pope Pius IX in 1867. Their martyrdom is commemorated annually in Gorinchem and has become an integral part of the city’s religious and cultural identity. As victims of religious persecution during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, their story symbolizes the broader conflict between Catholicism and Protestantism in the region. The martyrs hold a notable place in Dutch religious history, and their legacy continues to resonate with Catholics around the world.

By the 16th century, the city walls had deteriorated and were replaced with new fortifications and eleven bastions that are still almost completely intact. The new walls were completed in 1609 and were located further from the town centre, making the city twice as large. In 1673, Gorinchem became part of the old Dutch Water Line.

The city walls had four city gates: the Arkel Gate in the north, the Dalem Gate in the east, the Water Gate in the south (where the ferry to Woudrichem was), and the Kansel Gate in the west. Of these four gates, only the Dalem Gate remains. The others were removed in the 19th century to make way for vehicular traffic. A portion of the Water Gate was preserved in the gardens of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.
In the 18th century, the economy went into decline. After the French domination, the retreating French troops established themselves in the bastion fortress of Gorinchem. After a three-month siege they capitulated but the city was heavily damaged.

During the Industrial Revolution, Gorinchem recovered. Increased shipping led to new canals being dug and a railway connection to the city. Its population quickly increased, filling the inner city, and new neighbourhoods had to be built outside the city walls.

At the beginning of the 20th century, expansion took place in the Lingewijk and West neighbourhoods. After World War II, expansion started in the north-western portion of the municipality which was completed in the 1970s. This was followed by development of the neighbourhoods Wijdschild and Laag Dalem east of the city center. In 1986, the town Dalem was added to the municipality.

In August 2021 ANWB named Gorinchem the most beautiful star fort in the Netherlands.
== Demographics ==

Gorinchem had 37,456 inhabitants on 1 January 2021.

== Politics ==
The current mayor of Gorinchem is Reinie Melissant-Briene of the CDA. In 2023 a new municipal executive was agreed, consisting of the City Interest, VVD, CU-SGP, Gorcum Active and SP.

The municipal council of Gorinchem has 25 members, which are directly elected. The composition of the council at the 2022 Dutch municipal elections is shown in the table below.

==Transport==
The city is crossed by two motorways; the A15 on the northside, and the A27 on the westside.

The city also has a railway station: Gorinchem.

<text>″s-Gravendeel () is a village and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. &#x27;s-Gravendeel is on the eastern side of Hoeksche Waard Island on the river Dordtsche Kil. It is connected to Dordrecht by means of the Kil Tunnel.

The village was first mentioned in 1645 as Schravendeel, and means &quot;settlement of the Count (of Holland)&quot;. The village was founded after the new polder Nieuw-Bonaventura was drained in 1593. It used to be property of the States of Holland. In 1731, the village was sold to Dordrecht. &#x27;s-Gravendeel developed into the centre of the flax industry.

The Dutch Reformed church is a cruciform church built in 1905 after the 1637 church had burnt down. The tower was destroyed in 1945 and rebuilt in 1951.

&#x27;s-Gravendeel was home to 928 people in 1840. It was affected by the North Sea flood of 1953. In 1970, the old harbour was filled up and a new harbour was built on the Dordtsche Kil.

The municipality of &#x27;s-Gravendeel was merged with Binnenmaas on 1 January 2007. Since 1 January 2019, it is part of the new municipality Hoeksche Waard.

<text>″s-Gravenzande is a town in the province of South Holland, in the Netherlands. It is a part of the municipality of Westland, and lies about southwest of The Hague. Until 2004 it was a separate municipality and covered an area of 20.77 km2 (of which 3.38 km2 water).

The town of &#x27;s-Gravenzande had 15,241 inhabitants in 2011. The built-up area of the town was 2.7 km2, and contained 5,879 residences.

As of 1 January 2009, &#x27;s-Gravenzande is the largest town in Westland with 19.428 inhabitants.

The former municipality of &#x27;s-Gravenzande also included the township of Heenweg.

==History==

&#x27;s-Gravenzande is the only place in the Westland with a history as a town (&quot;stad&quot;). &#x27;s-Gravenzande was granted town rights (&quot;stadsrechten&quot;) in 1246 by Count William II of Holland who, just like his father Count Floris IV, regularly resided at his estate near the town. It is therefore the only town in Westland.

Machteld van Brabant, daughter of Duke Henry I and wife of Floris IV, was responsible for building the town&#x27;s church, and gave it a Madonna statue to which miraculous powers were attributed. &#x27;s-Gravenzande subsequently became a pilgrimage site.

The neighborhood of Gravesend, Brooklyn, New York in the United States is said by some to have been named for &#x27;s-Gravenzande. A 1656 Dutch map of Nova Belgica (New Netherland) confirms this, as it shows several Dutch names of towns like Vlissingen (Flushing), Breukelen (Brooklyn), Amersfoort (Flatlands), Heemstee (Hempstead) and Gravesant (&#x27;s-Gravenzande).

<text>Hardinxveld-Giessendam () is a municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. It is located about 10 km east of Dordrecht, on the river Beneden-Merwede. The municipality had a population of in and covers an area of of which is water.

The municipality of Hardinxveld-Giessendam consists of the two population centres Giessendam/Neder-Hardinxveld and Boven-Hardinxveld. Until they were merged in 1957, Giessendam and Hardinxveld were two municipalities, consisting of only a few streets and dykes and only a few thousand inhabitants.

The town&#x27;s economy is for a large part dependent on ship building (e.g. Damen Shipyards Group) and general contracting. Several industry parks are present.

==History ==
The village Hardinxveld is one of the oldest settlements of the Alblasserwaard. It is known that in 1105 a priest was present here, and therefore a church as well. Since 1282, Hardinxveld became a grand fiefdom. Through the centuries it suffered from warfare such as the Gelder Wars and the Eighty Years&#x27; War

The name Giessendam first appeared in 1231 and is most likely derived from the dam on the little peat river Giessen. This dam was the boundary between Hardinxveld and Giessendam for a long time.

The municipality was formed in 1957 by the merger of the former municipalities Hardinxveld and half of Giessendam. The rest of Giessendam&#x27;s territory went to the new municipality of Giessenburg which in turn was merged with Giessenlanden in 1986.

Since the 1960s, the municipality has grown significantly through the development of new neighbourhoods such as De Peulen, de Wielwijk, de Westwijk, and Tienmorgen. In recent years, the municipality had serious fiscal problems, resulting in direct oversight by the Province for a period of time. Considerable savings had to be made, necessitating significant increases to the relative low taxation in the town.

==Archeology==
Before the construction of the Betuweroute Highspeed Railway, thorough soil research was performed in 1997. During that research in Hardinxveld-Giessendam, some archeological items were found, including a 7500-year-old skeleton of a woman, now named &quot;Trijntje&quot;. It is the oldest skeleton found in the Netherlands up to this time. Since December 2003, the reconstructed corpse has been added to the collection of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden (National Museum of Antiquities) in Leiden. In April 1998, a dugout canoe was found.

==Transportation==
The Hardinxveld-Giessendam railway station, on the Elst–Dordrecht railway, is situated in the municipality.

== Notable people ==

* Job de Ruiter (1930 in Giessendam – 2015) a Dutch politician, diplomat and jurist
* Kommer Damen (born 1944) a Dutch billionaire, and the chairman of Damen Shipyards

<text>Heerjansdam () is a village in the western Netherlands, in the municipality of Zwijndrecht, South Holland. It has a population of 3,590.

==History==

It was originally called &quot;Heren Heyenland&quot;, a name which first appeared in a document from 1323. In 1331, Hendrik of Brederode started to build dikes around the Zwijndrechtse Waard. This project was financed by eight other persons, including Jan of Rosendaele, who subsequently were made landlords of the Waard. On November 25, 1368, Jan of Rosendaele renamed it to Heerjansdam (Dutch for &quot;Lord John&#x27;s dam&quot;), after the dam on the Waaltje.

In 2003 the municipality of Heerjansdam merged into Zwijndrecht.

<text>Hellevoetsluis () is a town and former municipality in the west of Netherlands. It is located in Voorne-Putten, South Holland. The former municipality covered an area of of which was water and it included the population centres of Nieuw-Helvoet, Nieuwenhoorn, and Oude en Nieuwe Struiten, all former municipalities.

Hellevoetsluis is located on the Haringvliet with the sea, beach, and dunes close by, on the extreme southern edge of the Rijnmond and Europoort areas, close to the broad Zeeland landscape. The name translates as &quot;lock at the foot of the Helle&quot;. The Helle was a small local river that disappeared over time.

On 1 January 2023, the municipality of Hellevoetsluis merged with Brielle and Westvoorne into the new municipality of Voorne aan Zee.

==History==
The area has been settled since before Roman times and was concentrated around a body of water called the &quot;Helle&quot;, which was later Latinized by the Romans to &quot;&quot;Helinium&quot; and &quot;Helius&quot;&quot;. The name Hel(le) Voet, &quot;Helius&#x27; foot&quot; or &quot;(land at) the lowest point of Helius&quot;, appears in documents from the 13th century and later, such as in 1395, when the Nieuw-Helvoet Polder is issued for inspection. This polder had a drainage sluice (Dutch: &quot;sluis&quot;) in the southern dike: the &quot;Hellevoetse sluis&quot;.

The history of Hellevoetsluis has always been connected with water. During the time of the Eighty Year&#x27;s War and the forming of the United Provinces Hellevoetsluis was the naval port of the Admiralty of de Maze (Rotterdam) and could accommodate an entire fleet within a special land-enclosed fortress with harbour and dockyard facilities, accessible through a canal. Thanks to its strategic situation the town grew from the beginning of the 17th century to be the homeport for the Dutch war fleet. In later years the port was fortified more and more and Hellevoetsluis, therefore, became a unique combination of a fortified town and a naval port. The Admirals Maarten Tromp, Michiel de Ruyter, and Piet Heyn had their home base here and in 1688 during the Glorious Revolution William III of Orange&#x27;s invasion fleet departed from the port.

In the early 1700s the English painter John Thornhill lamented on how townspeople in ports took advantage of travellers who often had to wait for the weather to calm before a ship could sail. Hellevoetsluis was one of the ports mentioned in his journal in 1711:

&quot;Gravesend, Dover, Deal and Harwich

&quot;The devil gave his daughter in marriage&quot;

&quot;And further to fulfil his will&quot;

&quot;He threw in Helvoetsluice and Brill&quot;&quot; 
The Voorne Canal &quot;Kanaal door Voorne&quot; was built in 1830 from Hellevoetsluis to Nieuwesluis (near Heenvliet) and made Hellevoetsluis an outport of Rotterdam. It was a period when the town grew and flourished; the shipping industry provided prosperity. Its neighbourhood may have been named after a vlotbrug constructed over the canal.

In the first half of the 20th century, however, Hellevoetsluis went into decline. Ocean-going ships became too large to use the canal and the Nieuwe Waterweg was dug, making the Canal through Voorne redundant. The naval base was relocated to Den Helder in the 1930s, the Government shipyard was closed, and during World War II the Germans destroyed three-quarters of all buildings in 1944. They also used the canal as a base for Biber submarines.

After World War II Hellevoetsluis grew considerably. As a New Town, the population doubled in the 1970s. Today 43,000 inhabitants live in modern houses with abundant green areas nearby. It is home to many commuters working in Europoort or Rotterdam.

During the flood of 1953 Hellevoetsluis was inundated and after this flood, the Netherlands implemented the &quot;Deltawerken&quot;, a vast plan that put in place sea-defenses such as dams to protect vulnerable Islands in the Meuse-Rhine river delta.

The town is home to several buildings from the 16th-19th Centuries that are listed monuments. Among these are the &quot;Admiraliteitsgebouw&quot; (currently used as town hall), the &quot;de Hoop&quot; windmill, Fort/Bastion Haerlem, &quot;Droogdok Jan Blanken&quot;: a historic shipbuilding site and, the Water Tower Hellevoetsluis, designed by architect N. Biezeveld and built in 1896.

==Facilities==
Hellevoetsluis has many shops: in addition to the various small (community) shopping centres, there is the covered shopping centre &quot;De Struytse Hoeck&quot;, which has over 120 shops and is partly built over the Canal through Voorne. Education up to secondary school level, a library, community centres, health care, and modern facilities for water sport are all available. Following the construction of the Haringvliet locks, the Haringvliet is ideal water for surfing and sailing. There are also extensive mooring facilities. Close by are the beach and the dunes at Voorne, a nature reserve.

==Tourism==

===Water sports===
Hellevoetsluis is one of the largest water sports centres in the country. There are 2,000 mooring places, spread over five harbours. With such a broad expanse of water as the Haringvliet and the North Sea close by, it is popular with water sports lovers and the Haringvliet is being used increasingly for national and international water sports events.


===Entertainment===
The old town centre, the fortress, has many terraces that look out upon the busy harbour and plenty of bars and restaurants serving &#x27;international&#x27; food. There are also restaurants and bars outside the fortress. A petting zoo, a sailing school, a fitness centre, tennis courts, a sauna, etc., are nearby.

===Events===
In August the &quot;Fortress Days&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Vestingdagen&quot;) are held. During the festivities which includes live music and a market, there are also displays of ships, aeroplane demonstrations, and a big firework display. However due to responsibility issues, the &quot;Fortress Day&quot; organization decided to no longer organize this event.

Every two years, the Dutch Classic Yacht Regatta is held in the harbour. A large number of classic, sharp yachts can be seen.

===Museums===
The town has well-preserved fortifications in the fortress. A walking tour leads to historical buildings such as the lighthouse, the Prinsehuis, Corn Mill &quot;De Hoop&quot;, and several museums. The museum &quot;Gesigt van &#x27;t Dok&quot;, situated at Oostzanddijk, contains a replica of the town, fortress, and naval shipyard as it was in 1834. This replica forms the heart of an exhibition on the development of Hellevoetsluis into a modern naval port at the beginning of the previous century.

The National Firefighting Museum, located in what used to be the Kuiperij and Grootmagazijn on Industriehaven, contains a rich collection ranging from the most primitive fire fighting equipment from centuries ago to the highly sophisticated equipment of today. Water buckets, fire hoses, water barrels, uniforms, hand- and steam engines, and many other devices that mark a point in the history of fire fighting are represented.

In the &quot;Oudheidskamer&quot;, also situated on the Industriehaven, there is a collection of items from the daily life of the past two centuries. It includes items that relate to the past of Hellevoetsluis as a naval port as well as agriculture-related articles.

Hellevoetsluis Dry Dock dates from 1806. It marks a revolutionary development in the history of shipbuilding and ship repair. The dry dock is still operational and has become a major historical and industrial/archaeological monument.

==International relations==
===Twin towns — Sister cities===
Hellevoetsluis is twinned with Torbay, England because on 5 November 1688 a fleet of 463 ships with 14,000 men landed William III of Orange in Torbay having sailed from Hellevoetsluis to claim thrones of Great Britain, as part of the Glorious Revolution

<text>Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht () is a town and municipality in the western Netherlands. It is located on the island of IJsselmonde, and borders with Zwijndrecht, Ridderkerk, and the Noord River (with Alblasserdam and Papendrecht on the other side).

The jurisdiction of the municipality covers an area of of which is water. The municipality comprises no other population centres.

== Name ==
Until 1855, the town was known as &quot;Hendrik-Ido-Schildmanskinderen-Ambacht en de Oostendam&quot;. Then it merged with Sandelingen-Ambacht and its full name for a period of time was said to be &quot;Hendrik-Ido-Oostendam-Schildmanskinderen-Groot-en-Klein-Sandelingen-Ambacht&quot;. This used to be the longest name of any town on the mainland of Europe.

== Topography ==
&quot;Dutch topographic map of the municipality of Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, June 2015&quot;
== History ==

The area has been populated from circa the year 1000 CE. Agriculture and animal husbandry were the only means of existence for many centuries. During these days, the land would often get flooded. Most of the land belonged to the Bishop of Utrecht during this period, except Heyenland (later known as Heerjansdam), which belong to Lord Hendrick I van Brederode (1305-1345). In 1323 the abbey sold its land to William III of Holland.

To combat the floods and utilize the lands more productively, William III and Hendrick van Brederode built up a dike around the land and had it dredged in 1332. To fund this endeavor, they sold parts of the lands to wealthy families (who held high public ranks within other cities) offering lordship titles and land ownership in return (as dictated by Zeelandic Laws concerning land ownership). Among these men were Hendrik Ido Wittens and his brother Schiltman Wittens, sons of the municipal executive of Gorinchem, Hendrik Yens Wittens. They received lordship of small pieces of land around the dead arm of the river Wale. The town Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht was made of a fusion of these two lordships. Over the years it expended by annexation and fusion with other lands of different lords. 

Not until the Eighty Years&#x27; War some industrial activities began to appear along the river dikes, like stonebakery and shipbuilding. Horticulture and flax growing also developed within the polders.

Because of the rapid industrial growth in iron foundries and shipyards in nearby villages (which produced lots of scrap waste), several families opened up ship breaking yards which grew into an industry resulting in the town becoming worldwide known as the &quot;ship breaking village&quot;.

The establishment of industries in the region changed the centuries-old seasonal labour to permanent work opportunities with higher wages. These industries were lost in later times when they moved abroad to lower wage countries. Nowadays the village functions as a commuter town, since its citizens mainly work elsewhere. 

Several monumental farms and buildings, including the 14th century Reformed Church, remain as a reminder of its historic past.

The municipal council of Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht has 23 seats. The Christian parties are strong in Ambacht.

<text>Hillegom () is a town and municipality in the Western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. Hillegom is part of an area called the Duin- en Bollenstreek (&quot;Dune and Bulb Region&quot;). As such, a large portion of the local economy was traditionally geared to the cultivation of bulb flowers.

The name Hillegom is derived from the abbey named &quot;Hijlighem&quot; (Old Frankish for &quot;Holy Home&quot;). This abbey no longer exists. The current Lord of Hillegom is Jan Six X.

==History==
Hillegom was formed on the eastern edge of the coastal dunes where the old Leiden to Haarlem route crossed the &quot;Hillegommerbeek&quot; (Hillegom&#x27;s Creek), not far from the shores of the &quot;Haarlemmermeer&quot; (Haarlem&#x27;s Lake). Places with the suffix &quot;-heim&quot; (or variant spellings) usually developed before the year 1000 and therefore it is assumed that this may apply to Hillegom as well. In 1150 the abbot of Egmond had the rights to naming priests in Hillegom, indicating that a church or chapel existed there. In 1248 the count Willem II gave the Chapel of Hijllinghem and all its buildings to the Abbot of Egmond.

In the middle of the 14th century, Hillegom gained some prominence when the counts of Holland convened there 3 times for council. In 1369, there were 46 houses with a population of 283, growing to 67 houses and 412 people in 1477.
During the Eighty Years&#x27; War, Hillegom found itself several times between the opposing Spanish and Dutch Rebel armies, resulting in its near destruction in 1577. But after the middle of the 17th century, the area became prosperous through the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, growing on the sandy soil of fields dug out the dunes.

In 1722, the rich Amsterdam merchant Jan Six II bought the fiefdom Hillegom and built improvements, including a stone bridge over the Hillegommerbeek and a pump in the village square as well as paving a portion of the main road. In 1749, he purchased &quot;Het Hof&quot; (The Courtyard), an estate in the centre of Hillegom. At this time, there were many other estates of rich merchants and stadtholders in Hillegom, such as Bethlehem, Oostende, Horstendael, Weeresteyn, Treslong, Duin en Weg, Meer en Dorp, Het Hof, Lapinenburg and Elsbroek (many of these names survive as neighborhood names). The population grew to 930 in 1732 and to 1050 in 1795.

In 1855 Hillegom absorbed the former municipality of De Vennip. During the 19th century, the beauty of the area and its estates slowly began to disappear. Developers bought the estates, cut down the forests, and excavated the sand dunes to create fields for bulb flower cultivation. This process accelerated in 1904 when a lime-sand brick factory was built just south of Hillegom, which needed large amounts of sand. By the early 1920s, all estates had disappeared, except for &quot;Het Hof&quot; which became Hillegom&#x27;s town hall. This same period saw the rapid growth of the bulb flower industry and Hillegom&#x27;s population, up to 8800 in 1916.

Hillegom&#x27;s convenient location led to another rapid growth period during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, when many new neighborhoods were built to accommodate families working in either Haarlem, Amsterdam, or Leiden. Its economy became less dependent on the bulb flower trade and more diversified with the establishment of a few business parks.

==Geography==

Hillegom is bordered by the municipalities of Bloemendaal (and formerly Bennebroek) to the north, Haarlemmermeer to the east, Lisse to the south, and Noordwijk (formerly Noordwijkerhout) to the west. The municipality covers an area of of which is water.

==Transportation==
Historically, much of the town&#x27;s transportation was done by water, either canals or streams.

The Hillegommerbeek (Hillegom&#x27;s Creek) was used to transport goods from the town to Haarlemmermeer (Haarlem&#x27;s Lake) and, after its reclamation, to the Ringvaart. Several docks and wharfs still line the creek and canal.

The &quot;Leidsevaart&quot; (Leiden Canal) was completed in 1657 and runs between Leiden and Haarlem just west of Hillegom. This canal has fallen in disuse because of its many non-operable bridges.

Hillegom is served by Provincial Roads 207, 208, and 442.

===Railway===

Hillegom is served by Hillegom railway station, with direct connections to Haarlem in the north and Leiden and The Hague southward.

==Tourism and attractions==
The most interesting time to visit is during the spring when the fields around Hillegom are in a colourful bloom. At this time a flower parade, the &quot;Bloemencorso&quot;, travels through its main streets.

Hillegom was home to the Den Hartogh Ford Museum, which had the world&#x27;s largest collection of Ford automobiles, until it closed down in 2016. It had over 200 classic cars, all from before World War II.

<text>Jacobswoude () is a former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland, now part of municipality Kaag en Braassem. Before the merger with Alkemade, the municipality covered an area of of which is water, mainly the lakes Braassemermeer and Wijde Aa. It consisted of the communities Bilderdam, Hoogmade, Leimuiden, Rijnsaterwoude, and Woubrugge, all located around the above-mentioned lakes. It had a population of 10,692 on 1 January 2004.

Jacobswoude is located in the center of the &quot;Groene Hart&quot; (Green Heart), the slightly less densely populated center area of the Randstad. Inhabitants of Jacobswoude depend on Alphen aan den Rijn, Leiden and Amsterdam for facilities not offered in the smaller villages. Most of its inhabitants commute daily to one of the larger cities in the region for work.

Jacobswoude was created on 1 January 1991 by merging the municipalities of Leimuiden, Rijnsaterwoude and Woubrugge. On 1 January 2009, Jacobswoude merged with Alkemade and formed the new municipality of Kaag en Braassem.

The municipality was named after the lost village of Jacobswoude that was located within the former municipal boundaries. The first mention of this village is from 823, when it is thought that Lord Jacob van den Woude was granted the area as a fiefdom from Louis the Pious. The peat surrounding the village was excavated, making Jacobswoude an island by the middle of the 18th century. This caused the village to deteriorate and its population moved to Woubrugge. Only a monument on the site of the original village remains.

Wireless Jacobswoude is a wireless community network under construction, starting in Woubrugge, connected to Wireless Leiden.

<text>Katwijk () is a coastal municipality and town in the province of South Holland, which is situated in the mid-western part of the Netherlands.

The Oude Rijn (&quot;Old Rhine&quot;) river flows through the town and into the North Sea.
Katwijk is located on the North Sea, northwest of Leiden and 16 km north of The Hague. It shares its borders with the municipalities of Noordwijk, Teylingen, Oegstgeest, Leiden, and Wassenaar.

In August 2020, Katwijk had a population of 65,929 and covers an area of , of which is water.

Katwijk is by far the largest town in the Duin- en Bollenstreek (&quot;Dune and Bulb Region&quot;).

==Districts==
The town consists of a number of districts, including namesakes Katwijk aan den Rijn and Katwijk aan Zee. On 1 January 2005 the various districts had the following populations:

:*Katwijk aan den Rijn (5,916)
:*Katwijk aan Zee (22,405)
:*Katwijk-Noord (13,845)
:*Rijnsburg (15,450)
:*Valkenburg (3,904)

Lying on the coast, Katwijk aan Zee is (and has always been) the larger town. Katwijk aan den Rijn lies just slightly inland. Rijnsburg is situated east of Katwijk aan den Rijn whereas Valkenburg finds itself to the south. Katwijk-Noord is situated north of Katwijk aan Zee.

Although consisting of historically separate towns (except Katwijk-Noord) that still today maintain separate identities, the towns have more or less grown together and merged into a single conurbation. The creation of the municipality of Katwijk is a recognition of that fact. The town hall of the current municipality of Katwijk is located in Katwijk aan den Rijn, near the boundary of Katwijk aan Zee. All these districts lie along the Oude Rijn.

==History==
The name &quot;Katwijk&quot; probably has its origins in the name of a Germanic tribe called the Chatten (Chatti). The Dutch word &quot;wijk&quot; means &quot;area&quot;, so the name probably meant something like &quot;the Chatti area&quot;.

In Roman times, Katwijk was a place of strategic importance. It was located at the Roman Empire&#x27;s northern border, at the mouth of the Rhine river, which in Roman times was larger in this area than it is today. There was a good deal of traffic along the Rhine. Katwijk was also a jumping-off point for the voyage to Britain.

Built during the reign of Emperor Claudius (41-54), the town&#x27;s name was &quot;Lugdunum Batavorum&quot;. The town&#x27;s name was later associated with the name of the city of Leiden, but this is now thought to be incorrect.

In 1231, the first reference to &quot;Catwijck&quot; appeared in records.

The history of the modern municipality of Katwijk is essentially the history of its constituent parts, which for each village extends back to Roman times. However, Katwijk aan Zee, Katwijk aan den Rijn and Valkenburg were part of the same heerlijkheid called &quot;Beide de Katwijken en &#x27;t Zand&quot; (or something similar). They have been administratively joined for centuries despite their differing characters. Katwijk aan Zee was a fishing town and Katwijk aan den Rijn had an agricultural character.

During World War II, Katwijk aan Zee was heavily damaged. On 1 May 1942 beach access was no longer permitted and large scale evacuation took place. From October 1943 houses were demolished as part of the construction of the Atlantic Wall.

On 1 January 2006, Rijnsburg and Valkenburg were also merged into the municipality, it&#x27;s called nowadays Katwijk.

==Public transportation==

Katwijk is a larger town in the Netherlands without a railway station, and the largest without any railway connection. The nearest railway stations are Voorhout and Leiden. Katwijk is connected by bus with Noordwijk, Leiden, The Hague and Lisse. The public transport by bus is served by Arriva.

==Tourist attractions==
Katwijk is a seaside resort with a wide sandy beach. Its attractiveness is mainly due to its laid-back atmosphere. The boulevard along the shore is not spoiled by large hotels or apartment blocks and has not given in to an excessive commercialisation. Although most buildings lining the boulevard are tourist apartments and pensions, most are just three floors high (and none more than five) and offer a distinctive &#x27;feel&#x27; of the 1950s. Besides the beach, there are a few museums in Katwijk, like the old fisherman&#x27;s museum Katwijks Museum and the Spinoza-museum. A few kilometers inland is the Valkenburg Lake Steam Train, a narrow-gauge railway museum where a scenic steam locomotive driven train ride can be taken around Lake Valkenburg. Katwijk has many hotels and three camping places, mostly situated in the dunes.

<text>Krimpen aan den IJssel () is a town and municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The municipality had a population of in , and covers an area of of which is water.

==History==
Krimpen is first mentioned in a document from 1277. Like other hamlets, many different spellings of its name have occurred over time, among which the name &quot;Tingenijssel&quot; deviated the most from today&#x27;s spelling. The municipality is on the south shore of the river Hollandse IJssel. For many centuries, the only buildings in Krimpen were farm houses built along the river dike. They formed more or less autonomous communities along the dike.

Before the 20th century, the two principal industrial employers were the brick factory &quot;Mijnlieff&quot; and the shipyard &quot;Van der Giessen de Noord&quot;.

In the beginning of the 20th century development began inland from the river dikes, and the municipality began to lose its agricultural character.

During the North Sea flood of 1953, the tidal barrier in the river IJssel proved to be inadequate. So in 1954 construction started on a new storm surge barrier, the first installation of the Delta Works.
In 1958 it was completed together with the Algera Bridge which connects Krimpen with Capelle aan den IJssel.

In the mid 1960s, Krimpen became a commuter town for people working in Rotterdam, resulting in major expansion. Today most of the municipality has been built up, except for the Krimpenerwaard where the town council aims to retain the rural character.

<text>Leerdam () is a city and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of Utrecht.
The municipality was merged with the municipalities of Vianen and Zederik on 1 January 2019. The name of the new municipality is Vijfheerenlanden which is a part of the province Utrecht. The former municipality Leerdam was a part of the province South Holland.

The south border of the town is formed by the river Linge. The name originates from a dam in the river Lede which was a branch from the river Linge towards Meerkerk. Leerdam is situated almost exactly in the middle of the three highways A2, A15, and A27.

==History==
Leerdam received city rights in 1407. The small river Linge, bordered by beautiful water meadows, defines the atmosphere and tone of the landscape. Several centuries ago Leerdam formed a part of the Vijfheerenlanden domain, before it was raised to the level of County in 1498.

In 1551, Leerdam, together with Acquoy, became property of the House of Orange and part of the County of Holland.

The rich history of Leerdam can be found in well-kept historic buildings such as the &quot;Grote Kerk&quot; (Great Church), the &quot;Hofje van Mevrouw van Aerden&quot; (Mrs. Aerden Almshouses, now a museum), the remaining and restored city walls on the &quot;Zuidwal&quot; and the &quot;Oude Raadhuis&quot; (Old City Hall).

In South Africa a fort was built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679 in the coastal city Cape Town. It is called Castle of Good Hope. The corners of this fort received names in honour of William of Orange-Nassau and because Leerdam was part of the House of Orange-Nassau one of those corners were named Leerdam.

==Glass industry==
Since the 18th century, the town&#x27;s culture has been strongly influenced by the glass industry and the timber industry. The glass currently manufactured in Leerdam is internationally known as Royal Leerdam or (particularly in respect of designer glass and glass art) as Royal Leerdam Crystal. This, with the National Glass Museum, the Glass Centre (with its glassblowing and demonstration activities), and several art galleries, make Leerdam a major tourist attraction in the Netherlands.

Glassblowers work in the Glass Centre in Leerdam, which is open to the public.

== Cheese ==

The cheese Leerdammer is named after Leerdam, but is actually producted in Schoonrewoerd, located in the same municipality.

==Public transport==
The Leerdam railway station is situated on the Elst–Dordrecht railway.

==Born in Leerdam==
* Cornelis Pieter van den Hoek (1921–2015), resistance fighter during World War II
* Jan van Houwelingen (1939–2013), politician
* Manon van Rooijen (born 1982), freestyle swimmer

<text>Leiderdorp () is a town and municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland near the city of Leiden. It had a population of in .

The municipality covers an area of of which is water. Leiderdorp has now become a suburb of the city of Leiden, although the Oude Rijn (Old Rhine) river and the Zijl river separate the two. The HSL-Zuid high-speed rail line between Amsterdam and Brussels crosses Leiderdorp in a tunnel.

It is one of the oldest towns in South Holland province and was a base for the Spanish army in the Eighty Years&#x27; War.

== History ==
Excavations have shown that as early as during the Iron Age in the area of current day Leiderdorp hunters and fishers roamed around and lived on the dry places around the river.

=== Roman Period ===
The Rhine, which passes through Leiderdorp, functioned as the Northern border of the Roman Empire. Close to Leiderdorp, the Romans built a fort, Matilo. Around the fall of the Western Roman Empire the Romans retreated from the area.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the middle ages, the first permanent settlement appeared. The Rhine served as a connection between the sea and the hinterland, and there is evidence of trade taking place. During the late Middle Ages three castles were built in Leiderdorp, Huis ter Zijl (1260), Huis ter Does (around 1300) and Huis Berendrecht (around 1420).

In 1396 the Augustinian monastery Engelendael was founded. The monks copied books, cared for the sick and worked the fields. The monastery was abandoned in 1574, but its legacy is still present as the arterial road of Leiderdorp is called Engelendaal.

=== Eighty Years&#x27; War ===
In 1492 the first bridge crossing the Rhine was built. In 1514 Leiderdorps population had grown to 500. During the Siege of Leiden Leiderdorp was the headquarters of the Spanish General Francisco de Valdez, who ultimately failed to capture the city. In 1620 the Protestant Dorpskerk (town church) is constructed. The Dorpskerk celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2020 with a series of concerts and exhibitions.

=== 1700-1940 ===
From 1597 till 1795 Leiden had administrative rights over Leiderdorp, which led to the town becoming even more dependent on the larger city. In 1795 Leiderdorp decreases in size as the neighbouring Leiden expands. A rope factory was constructed in 1806, and in 1862 the first school was established on the Hoofdstraat (main street). A shipyard was constructed in 1877, and in 1915 social housing designed by famous Dutch architect Willem Marinus Dudok was erected.

=== Second World War ===
During the Second World war a bunker was constructed in the neighbouring fields, and a pen factory and community centre were destroyed to make way for it. The spires of one of the churches was used as a sniper&#x27;s nest.

<text>Leidschendam-Voorburg () is a municipality in the Western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland, just northeast of The Hague. It had a population of in , and covers an area of of which is water.

==Origin==
The municipality of Leidschendam-Voorburg is the result of merging the municipalities Leidschendam and Voorburg in 2002. It consists of the two towns Leidschendam and Voorburg, which grew towards each other in the first half of the 20th century. The village Stompwijk and a hamlet called Wilsveen also belong to the municipality.

Leidschendam-Voorburg abuts the city of The Hague and is often regarded as its suburb, even though it is an independent municipality. It is part of the Haaglanden conurbation. Stompwijk is still a rural village, located a few kilometres northeast of Leidschendam.

==Historic town centers==

Both Leidschendam and Voorburg have their own historic town center, which are decentrally situated.
Historic Leidschendam lies around the ancient locks in the Vliet canal in the eastern part of the town.
About 3 kilometers to the south is the beginning of the Herenstraat, the main street of the Voorburg town center. The center of Voorburg is mainly situated between this half a kilometer long street and the Vliet. The canal also forms the eastern border of the town. The most important buildings like Swaensteyn House, the Old Church (Oude Kerk) and Hofwijck are in or very near the Herenstraat.

== Mall of the Netherlands ==
Until 2019 the Leidschendam shopping mall Leidsenhage was undergoing a total makeover. The new shopping area was expanded to 117.000 square meters. The center also got a new name: &quot;Westfield Mall of the Netherlands&quot;.

==Sister cities==
Leidschendam-Voorburg is twinned with:
The municipality was also twinned with Temecula in California, United States from 1993 to 2019.

==Transport==
===Public transport===
====Railway====
Three railway stations are located within the municipality, providing links with all major cities in the Randstad. The main train station is Voorburg station on The Hague-Utrecht railway line. This station is on the Southern edge of the town centre. 
There are two stations on the Rotterdam-Amsterdam line, which are situated on the border of The Hague: Den Haag Laan van NOI (for some Intercity trains and local trains) and Den Haag Mariahoeve (only for local trains).

====Light rail====
Leidschendam-Voorburg has two stations on the RandstadRail lines. RandstadRail is the official name for a light rail project connecting the cities of The Hague, Rotterdam and Zoetermeer. These lines use former train routes, which are now converted for use by light rail vehicles. 
It is a somewhat confusing name as for travelers &quot;RandstadRail&quot; is only used for tram 3 and 4 to Zoetermeer. The line to Rotterdam is exploited as a branch of the Rotterdam metro: Rotterdam metro line E. 
Stations in Leidschendam-Voorburg (for both trams and metro) are &quot;Voorburg &#x27;t Loo&quot; and &quot;Leidschendam-Voorburg&quot;. RandstadRail also stops at &quot;Den Haag Laan van NOI&quot; train station.

====Bus and tram====
There are two major bus services running through this municipality. They are HTM and EBS.
Several tram trajectories through Leidschendam-Voorburg - run by HTM - connect various parts of the city with each other, as well as with various neighbouring cities.

===Roads===
Leidschendam-Voorburg is connected to the A4 (Amsterdam - Belgian border by Rotterdam) and A12 (The Hague - German border by Utrecht) motorways, which cross each other near the city center of Voorburg.

The N14 dual carriageway, which connects the A4 at Leidschendam to the N44 dual carriageway at Wassenaar runs through a series of tunnels in the municipality.

Together with a part of motorway A4 and several local roads the N14 forms the Ring Den Haag.

===Cycle paths===
Like every Dutch municipality, Leidschendam-Voorburg provides a wide range of facilities for cyclers. As an example, on the eastern edge, there are two large cycle bridges that cross different roads and ditches.

The former municipality had a population of 9,810 in 2006, and covered an area of of which was water. Since 2013 Liesveld had been a part of the new municipality of Molenwaard (ceased to exist in 2019).

The former municipality of Liesveld was formed on 1 January 1986 from the former municipalities of Groot-Ammers, Langerak, Nieuwpoort, and Streefkerk. It consisted of the population centres Groot-Ammers, Langerak, Nieuwpoort, Streefkerk, and Waal.

Its name is probably derived from a low-lying swampy area filled with reed grasses (Dutch: &quot;lies&quot; - &quot;Glyceria maxima&quot;) near Gelkenes. Castle Liesvelt was built on such a reedy field, giving its name to the Lords of Liesvelt, who owned lands within the municipality.

<text>Lisse () is a town and municipality in the province of South Holland in the Western Netherlands. The municipality, which lies within the Duin- en Bollenstreek, covers an area of of which is water. Its population was in . Located within the municipal boundary is also the community De Engel.

==History==
===Early history===

The history of Lisse is closely related and similar to the neighboring towns of Hillegom and Sassenheim. Based on a document from 1198 which makes official mention of the town&#x27;s name, Lisse celebrated its 800-year anniversary in 1998, although there is an indication that there was already a settlement there in the 10th century.

In the Middle Ages, Lisse was a small settlement; there were only 50 houses in 1500. Because of prolonged warfare (particularly the wars of Charles the Bold and the Eighty Years&#x27; War), poverty was prevalent. Its population lived from agriculture, animal husbandry and peat harvesting.

===Recent history===
In the 17th and 18th centuries, Lisse was, like Hillegom, home to many estates of rich merchants and nobility. The forests and gardens of Keukenhof, Meerenburg, Wildlust, Zandvliet, Overduin en Akervoorde, Wassergeest, Grotenhof, Ter Specke, Dubbelhoven, Rosendaal, Veenenburg en Berkhout, Middelburg, Ter Beek and Uytermeer estates all added to the town&#x27;s beauty and glory.

Yet in the following centuries, every one of these estates (except Keukenhof) was removed to make way for the cultivation of bulb flowers. The sandy soil in Lisse&#x27;s surroundings were highly suitable for its growth provided the soil was fertilised. The nearby dunes were excavated and forests cut down progressively over time for more fields for the flower business. This brought employment and prosperity to this area.

==Floriculture centre==
In the 20th century, the bulb flower business continued to boom, resulting in the establishment of auction and trading houses, large-scale cultivators and cooperatives. Today, Lisse exports bulbflowers in large quantities to over a hundred countries worldwide.

Located at the centre of the &quot;Dune and Bulb Region&quot; (Duin- en Bollenstreek), Holland&#x27;s flower-growing region, Lisse is also a major tourist attraction. During the spring when the fields around Lisse are in a colourful bloom, hundreds of thousands of local and foreign tourists visit the area. The only remaining estate that was not removed for flower cultivation (Keukenhof) became world-famous for its flower displays.

==Tourism and attractions==
The most popular attraction in Lisse is Keukenhof, open only during spring when the tulips are flowering. Also each spring a flower parade called the Bollenstreek &quot;Bloemencorso&quot; is held through the main streets of Lisse. In August the fantasy festival Castlefest is held in the gardens of Castle Keukenhof.

Other places of interest are the museums:
*Huys Dever, a restored castle tower from the 14th century
*Castle Keukenhof, part of the Keukenhof estate but open year-round
*Museum De Zwarte Tulp (Black Tulip Museum), exhibiting the history of the Dutch bulb-growing region
*LAM Museum, an art gallery about food

==Sports==
Lisse is the home of FC Lisse, a football team currently playing in the Zaterdag Topklasse. On 3 May 2008 FC Lisse sealed the championship of the 2007/2008 season in the Hoofdklasse A.

<text>Maasland (population: 6,844) is a village in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. It lies in the municipality (&quot;gemeente&quot;) of Midden-Delfland and covers an area of 24.42 km2 (of which 0.64 km2 water). It is located in a countryside area with dairy farms that is surrounded by various urban concentrations, namely the city of Rotterdam, the municipality of Westland (area with intensive greenhouse horticulture activities), and the towns of Vlaardingen and Maassluis.

==History==
From approximately 700, the area was populated, presumably by Frisians. It was first the royal domain, and later went to the local counts. During the later period, an area of about was made dry and suitable for living. The first signs of a community at the current location of the village started back in 985 when the area was given by the Emperor Otto III to Graaf Dirk II and a church was built. After severe floodings during the 12th century, the Maasdijk was rebuilt and the village centre relocated to its current site. In 1241 Graaf Willem II let the German Teutonic Knights draw on the territory of Maasland. Furthermore, in 1243 a nobleman, Diederik van Coldenhove, gave all his property in Oude Campspolder, north of the current village center, to the Order, and a commandery was established there to manage the properties of the Order in Maasland.

In 1450 the &#x27;Poldermolen&#x27; (translation: Poldermill) was built in Maasland.

During the war between Spain and the Netherlands a huge area of the Netherlands was flooded which was part of the strategy of Willem van Oranje. In 1574, these floodings affected Maasland, and once again the village was flooded. It took a couple of years before the villagewas rebuilt and in 1614 part of the village Maasland (which included the Maeslandsluys) gained independency and is known as the town Maassluis.

Until the new village hall was built in 1874 meetings of the village council meetings were held in the tavern &#x27;de Pynas&#x27;.

In the late 20th century the village of Maasland and its surrounding communities were governed as the municipality (&quot;gemeente&quot;) of Maasland, with most governmental functions based in the village.

In 2004, the village of Maasland became part of the municipality (&quot;gemeente&quot;) of Midden-Delfland upon the merger of the municipality of Maasland and the municipality of Schipluiden.

<text>Maassluis () is a town in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The municipality had a population of in and covered of which was water.

It received town rights in 1811.

==History==

Maassluis was founded circa 1340 as a settlement next to a lock (in Dutch: &quot;sluis&quot;) in the sea barrier between the North Sea and Rotterdam. Originally &quot;Maeslandsluys&quot;, it was part of Maesland. In 1489 the settlement was sacked. During the Eighty Years&#x27; War, Philips of Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde, started to build a defense wall but before its completion, the Spanish captured it in 1573 and Philips of Marnix was taken prisoner. A year later Maeslandsluys was looted by mutinous Spanish troops.

On 16 May 1614, Maeslandsluys was separated from Maesland by the counts of Holland and renamed Maassluis. This separation may have been religiously motivated: Maassluis was predominantly Protestant and Maasland Catholic. In 1624 the defense wall was demolished to make way for the Great Church, started in 1629. Construction stopped for five years because privateers from Dunkirk raided fishing boats from Maassluis, throwing their crew overboard. It was finished in 1639. On 4 December 1732, the Garrels Organ was inaugurated. Built from 1730 to 1732 by Rudolf Garrels, a pupil of Arp Schnitger, it was a gift by Govert van Wijn, ship-owner from Maassluis.

In 1811 Napoleon Bonaparte granted town rights.

During World War II, the working population was transferred to Germany for the war industry. Maassluis&#x27; ancient church was hit by allied bombers.

===Jewish history===
The Jewish community had its own synagogue, a teacher, a singer and a ritual butcher. Its most common professions were salesman, street trader and butcher. The economy was vulnerable and community growth ended with the industrial revolution. The area became easier to reach and competition became too much. The number of Jews fell from 92 to eight between 1892 and 1930. A cause was the building of a railway in 1881 between Maassluis and Rotterdam. Most Jewish traders moved to Rotterdam, The Hague and Amsterdam, which in the last decade of the 19th century had a growing Jewish population.

Integration in Maassluis ended during the Second World War. The Coltof and Van Gelderen families were deported in 1942 and murdered in Auschwitz.

==Economy==
Maassluis was historically dependent on the fishing near the coast and off Iceland. In the 19th century the tugboat company, L. Smit, and the marine salvage company W.A. van den Tak merged to become Smit-Tak, now a division of the world&#x27;s largest salvage company, Smit International. Also, there is still a large shipping agency called Royal Dirkzwager. Maassluis is now mainly a commuter town for Rotterdam.

<text>Middelharnis () is a town and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland, on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee. The town had a population of about 6,800 in 2012. On 1 January 2013, Middelharnis merged with Goedereede, Dirksland, and Oostflakkee into the new municipality of Goeree-Overflakkee. 

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1466 as &quot;die Middelharnisse&quot;. The etymology is disputed. Middelharnis developed after a dike was built around the Oudeland &quot;polder&quot; in 1465. In 1598, a fish auction was built in Middelharnis and it developed into a regional centre.

The Dutch Reformed church is a double aisled cruciform church from the 15th century. The tower was built in stages from 1475 until 1520. The church was devastated by fire in 1904 and later restored.

The former town hall is a prominently situated neoclassic building with ridge turret built between 1639 and 1640. It was designed by . It was extended between 1834 and 1839. The town hall is in use as the Rien Poortvliet since 1992.

Middelharnis was home to 3,104 people in 1840 and was home to 7,755 people in 2022. It merged with Sommelsdijk into a single urban area. It was an independent municipality until 2013 when it merged into Goeree-Overflakkee. The town hall of the new municipality is located in Middelharnis.

Middelharnis has a shopping area called &quot;D&#x27;n Diek&quot;. This shopping center settled itself on a dike which used to be the last barrier for the town from the Haringvliet. The town hosts two public and one Christian high school. Middelharnis has an inland harbor with connection to the Haringvliet. There is also a small beach which can get very crowded in the summertime. In Middelharnis the old main street has the old municipality building.

Tourism is an increasingly important economic factor in the area; Otter Tail County contains 1,048 of the state&#x27;s lakes,

===New York Mills Regional Cultural Center===
Faced with the economic challenges and decreasing population of many rural communities, New York Mills decided to invest in a Regional Arts Center in an attempt to bring tourism to the area. In 1991, the city contributed $35,000 to the Regional Arts Retreat and Cultural Center to convert a downtown mercantile building into a multi-use arts and cultural facility. As a per-capita investment, this expenditure was the equivalent of Minneapolis giving $13.7 million to an arts facility. The center, remodeled through a community-wide volunteer effort, opened in June 1992, as a nonprofit arts organization founded by John Davis. Further renovations include a hardwood maple floor in the main gallery and an outdoor deck completed in 2005. While other communities withered in the face of declining populations and deteriorating main streets, New York Mills has remained stable economically, and the Cultural Center continues to draw people, activity, revenue and national attention.

<doc id="121159" wikidata="Q846242" url="?curid=121159" title="Nieuw-Lekkerland">
<text>Nieuw-Lekkerland () is a town in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. It is situated on the southern shores of the Lek River, in the north-west of the Alblasserwaard.

The town&#x27;s name evolved slightly over time: in 1280 Leckerlant, in 1331 Niewe Leckerland, and in 1903 Nieuw Lekkerland. It means &quot;land of or near the river Lek&quot; with the addition of &quot;nieuw&quot; (&quot;new&quot;) to distinguish it from Old Lekkerland (now Lekkerkerk) across the river.

==History==
The name Nieue-Leckelant appears for the first time around 1325. The most notable building used to be Castle Schoonenburg. Because of its elevated location on a mount, it served as a refuge for the people during floods before the reclamation of the Alblasserwaard. After 1456, the castle was abandoned and became a ruin. Its remains were thereafter probably used to rebuild a church tower. Only the mount is still visible. In 1848, the Reformed Church was built.

Nieuw-Lekkerland&#x27;s economy was based on agriculture, cattle raising, and fishing. In the 19th century, ship building and industry developed, resulting in an increasing population: from 770 in 1820, 1153 in 1840, 2000 in 1867, to 9400 in 2004.

In 2013, the municipality of Nieuw-Lekkerland merged into the new municipality of Molenwaard. In 2019, Molenwaard merged into Molenlanden.

== Attractions ==
The number one attraction nearby are the adjacent windmills at Kinderdijk.

In Nieuw-Lekkerland, a retirement home on the Lek dike was built in 1885, designed by Aart den Boer. It was commissioned as a dike management house by Leendert Smit Fopzoon, Ambachtsheer van Nieuw-Lekkerland and his spouse Neeltje Smit. The eclectic-styled building has space for about 15 inhabitants and a landlord. The basement houses the kitchen, the ground floor holds the common room and the second floor contains the room of the regent.

<text>Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel (; population: 22,344 in 2004) is a town and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. Since 2010 it is part of the new municipality of Zuidplas.

It is situated along the Hollandsche IJssel river, across from the town Ouderkerk aan den IJssel.

Within the boundaries of this municipality lies the lowest point of the Netherlands: below Amsterdam Ordnance Datum (mean summer sea level in Amsterdam). It is the hometown of Miss Universe 1989, Angela Visser.

==History==

Nieuwerkerk was probably first formed circa 1250. The first reference to &quot;Nuwekerke&quot; is from 1282 when Count Floris V loaned the land between Kralingen and Gouda to a certain Traveys of Moordrecht. Another reference is from 22 January 1317 when Count William III of Holland sold the fiefdoms Capelle and Nieuwerkerk to John III van de Werve, Lord of Hovorst for 325 Dutch Pounds.

The original old village formed on a mount between shallow lakes. These lakes were the result of peat harvesting. In 1839 the first one was drained and made into a polder, the current Zuidplaspolder, and in 1866, the Alexanderpolder was made.

The railway between Rotterdam and Gouda was built in 1855 and resulted in the growth of the village. Other periods of rapid development followed after the Second World War and in the early 1980s.

During the North Sea Flood of 1953, a dike along that river broke, and the mayor of Nieuwerkerk successfully managed to plug the hole by ordering shipper Arie Evegroen to navigate his grain barge &quot;Twee Gebroeders&quot; (Two Brothers) into it.

<text>Noordwijk () is a town and municipality in the west of the Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The municipality covers an area of of which is water and had a population of in .

On 1 January 2019, the former municipality of Noordwijkerhout became part of Noordwijk.

Besides its beaches, Noordwijk is also known for its bulb flower fields. It is located in an area called the &quot;Dune and Bulb Region&quot; (Duin- en Bollenstreek).

Noordwijk is also the location of the headquarters for the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), part of the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA&#x27;s visitors&#x27; centre Space Expo is a permanent space exhibition.

==Communities==
The municipality of Noordwijk consists of the communities Noordwijk aan Zee and Noordwijk-Binnen, separated by a narrow green belt, as well as Noordwijkerhout and De Zilk.

===Noordwijk aan Zee===

Noordwijk aan Zee was founded around 1200 as a fishing village. Until the beginning of the 19th century, fishing remained its primary business, but then began to be replaced by the growing tourism industry. Nowadays because of its long sandy beaches, it is a popular resort town with 1,000,000 overnight stays per year.
It has a lighthouse &amp; a KNRM rescue station. Furthermore, it has a reformed church (1647) with a pulpit from the 17th century.

Noordwijk aan Zee is rated as the 12th richest location in the Netherlands.

A small part of the indigenous population of Noordwijk aan Zee speaks Noordwijks, a very original Dutch dialect, which sounds like Katwijks, but in Noordwijk the dialect is almost gone, compared to Katwijk, where more people speak in (partly) dialect.

===Noordwijk-Binnen===

Because of the martyrdom of Priest Jeroen in 857, the Archbishop of Utrecht made Noordwijk-Binnen a pilgrimage location in 1429. Both the Catholic and Protestant churches here are named after this priest.

Noordwijk-Binnen has retained its historic character and is therefore protected by the Dutch Monument Law. An interesting historic view is shown by the picture of Gerard van der Laan with the view to the Jeroenskerk. In the foreground is a canal with two sailboats for inland waterways.

The area around Noordwijk-Binnen has long been an important part of the regional bulb flower industry. The dunes were dug out and transformed into fields for the cultivation of bulb flowers.
The territory of Noordwijk still consists mostly of geest. The bulb region is formed of Noordwijk together with surrounding municipalities.

===Noordwijkerhout===
==Nature==
North (and to a lesser extent south) of Noordwijk spreads a relatively vast dune area, in which a varied wild flora and fauna (with among others pine forests and deer) is observable for bikers, walkers and gallopers. North of Noordwijk, large areas of dunes are covered by the natura 2000 act. Part of which holds house to the Kennemer Zweefvlieg Club.

==Personalities and public figures in Noordwijk==

Public figures who lived in Noordwijk or sought recovery were Thomas Mann, Maria Montessori (buried in Noordwijk) among others, the entrepreneur Alfred Heineken, ex-Empress Soraya, the poet Henriette Roland Holst, the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, the writer Stefan George, the pianist Pia Beck, the tenor Jacques Urlus, the writer Margriet de Moor as well as painters and artists such as Marinus Gidding, Gerard van der Laan, Max Liebermann, Daniël Noteboom, Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller and known film actors.

The landscape painter Ludolph Berkemeier (buried in Noordwijk) moved in 1896 to Noordwijk. His paintings are in the style of the Hague School.

Noordwijk is also home of football coach Louis van Gaal.

In March 2014, the US President Barack Obama and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping stayed in Noordwijk

Part of Martin Ritt&#x27;s adaptation of John le Carre&#x27;s The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), starring Richard Burton, was filmed at Koningin Astrid Boulevard in Noordwijk. This is where Burton&#x27;s character Alec Leamas is taken for initial interrogation after appearing to defect to the East.

===Notable people===
* Janus Dousa (1545–1604) Lord of Noordwyck, a Dutch statesman, jurist, historian, poet and philologist 
* Petrus Jacobus Runckel (1822 in Noordwijk-Binnen – 1860) a Dutch colonial government official in the Dutch Gold Coast

==World War II bunker complex==

Just north of Noordwijk, buried in the North Sea dunes, lies one of the biggest and most extensive bunker complexes in the Netherlands of the World War II Atlantic Wall defenses, constructed under Nazi Germany occupation. Some 80 bunkers and underground structures housed 180 soldiers, and were connected by 400 metres (a quarter-mile) of tunnels, equipped with narrow rail-tracks for moving heavy ammunition. The central, S414 design, fire command bunker alone counts three-man-high stories deep, and with walls up to thick, it consists of more than 1,800 m3 of concrete – the equivalent content of some 300 modern cement trucks. Four heavy gun bunkers housed 155mm cannons and doubled as living quarters. Two other large bunkers stored ammunition.

The fire control bunker offered an excellent view of the coastal sea, used for observation and ballistic trajectory calculation, to control the entire gun battery. In 2001, the central command bunker was reopened as a museum, refitted with mostly original equipment. Because the Germans kept the men busy building further bunkers, pill-boxes, etc., by war&#x27;s end the complex counted almost one underground structure for every two men.

==Museum of Comic Art, Noordwijk==
* Since 2021 Noordwijk has its own comics museum, the MoCA, or Museum of Comic Art, Noordwijk.

<text>Oegstgeest () is a town and municipality in the province of South Holland in the western Netherlands. Its population was in .

== Etymology ==

The portion &quot;geest&quot; in the name refers to the geest lands, which were excavated in the seventeenth century for the benefit of the urban expansion of Leiden.

There exists more uncertainty about the &#x27;Oegst&#x27; part. There are various stories. The name was formerly often spelled Oestgeest or Oostgeest, which could indicate the geographical location of the village: east of the geest lands. However, the oldest spelling found in a copy of a list of goods of the St. Martin&#x27;s Cathedral in Utrecht from the tenth century states Osgeresgeest. This could indicate an original resident and owner of the territory: Osger.

In the Middle Ages they also spoke of the Church of Kerckwerve if one referred to the Oegstgeester parish church (now the Green Church).

==History==

Oegstgeest is one of the earliest inhabited places along the coast. Evidence of a Batavian settlement from the second century was found in 1946 in an extension of a coastal dune in the Elgeesterpolder, although it is not certain whether this location remained permanently inhabited in the centuries after that.

By the 9th century, there was already a little church in the same location as the current Little Green Church (&quot;Groen Kerkje&quot;) which, according to legend, was dedicated by Willibrord. The existence of this church is an indication that there may have been a community there.

From the 11th to the 14th century, Oegstgeest enjoyed a period of progress. This ended when Leiden was granted city rights. The carrying out of trades and construction were no longer permitted within a certain distance from the city. In 1399, the heerlijkheid of Oegstgeest and that of Poelgeest were merged because their declining populations could no longer afford to pay the required taxes to the Count of Holland.

Until the 19th century the boundary of Oegstgeest extended right to the city walls and moats of Leiden. But in the 19th and 20th century, it conceded more and more of its territory to the rapidly expanding city of Leiden.

Before the early 20th century, Oegstgeest had a rural character and did not have a centre of population. It consisted of several unconnected smaller settlements. Only after 1900 were new neighbourhoods built between the settlements. First Wilhelminapark was built, followed by Prins Hendrikpark (circa 1915), Buitenlust or Indische Buurt (1925), Julianapark, Oranjepark, and Emmapark (1920-1950), and Grunerie and the area between Emmalaan and Lange Voort (1950s). In the 1980s and 1990s, the Haaswijk and Morsebel neighbourhoods were built, followed by Poelgeest in the 2000s. In 2006 construction started on a new neighbourhood, Nieuw Rhijngeest.
== Geography ==
The municipality of Oegstgeest covers an area of of which is water. Oegstgeest lies just to the north of Leiden, with which it is conjoined in a conurbation and formed the Leiden region. Oegstgeest is a separate municipality, but it is effectively a suburb of Leiden. The municipality of Katwijk is to the west, the municipality of Teylingen to the north, the Kaag Lakes (Kagerplassen) to the northeast and Leiderdorp to the east.

== Sports ==
Oegstgeest has 2 football clubs: FC Oegstgeest and ASC. At the latter cricket is also played. FIKS is the local korfball team. At LOHC hockey is played and the neighbouring OLTC (founded 1886) is the tennis club of the municipality. Oegstgeest has one volleyball club called VCO.

<text>Oostflakkee () is a former municipality on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The former municipality covered an area of about 107 km2 (of which about 33 km2 was covered by water), and had a population of about 10,000 in 2007. On January 1, 2013, Oostflakkee merged with Goedereede, Dirksland, and Middelharnis into the new municipality of Goeree-Overflakkee.

The former municipality of Oostflakkee was formed by the amalgamation of the former municipalities of Den Bommel, Ooltgensplaat, and Oude Tonge in 1966. It consisted of the communities of Achthuizen, Langstraat, Den Bommel (with Zuidzijde), Ooltgensplaat, Oude-Tonge, and Zuidzijde.

Oude Tonge was the main town of this former municipality and has a considerable industrial area. It also has a large busstation. Den Bommel is quite similar as Stad aan &#x27;t Haringvliet with a harbor and beach on the shores of the Haringvliet. A few kilometers east of Den Bommel there is Zuidzijde, a very small town with a neat looking watertower. Ooltgensplaat is the most eastward town on the island with a harbor on the Volkerak. The town has a very old and beautiful municipal building. This town is the yearly start and finish of De Omloop - a 100+ km walk around the island in a 24-hour period. This event attracts thousands every year either participants or bystanders. It is held yearly in the latter half of August. Achthuizen and Langstraat are other small towns nearby Ooltgensplaat.

<text>Oud-Beijerland () is a town and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland, now a part of the Hoeksche Waard municipality. With a population of 24,575 in 2020, it is the most populous town of the Hoeksche Waard island. The town is located adjacent to the confluence of the Oude Maas and Spui River.

The town of Oud-Beijerland also includes the communities Vuurbaken and Zinkweg.

==History==

After the St. Elizabeth&#x27;s flood (1421), large parts of the islands Putten and Grote Waard were lost and became clay banks and salt marshes which would be inundated at high tide and be unsuitable for habitation. In subsequent centuries, portions of land would be reclaimed.

Oud-Beijerland was formed in 1559 as &quot;Beijerland&quot; by Lamoral, Count of Egmont. He was granted the rights to this area in 1557 and had the land reclaimed. This new polder was named &quot;Beijerland, Moerkerken, Cromstrijen en de Greup&quot;. Circa 1624 the smaller polders Bosschenpolder and Nieuwlandpolder were added to it. Beijerland was named after Sabina of Bavaria (Dutch: &quot;Beijeren&quot;), wife of the Count of Egmont.

In 1582 the name was changed to Oud-Beijerland, in order to distinguish it from Nieuw-Beijerland which was formed several kilometers to the west.

In 1604 the village got its churchtower from Sabina van Beijeren, and in 1622 the town hall was built. Oud-Beijerland then became one of the most important market places of the Hoeksche Waard. Its economy was dependent on trade, industry, agriculture and fishing. This brought prosperity which is still reflected in the elegant mansions along the Vliet.

From the end of the 19th century until ca. 1955, a tram connected Oud-Beijerland with Rotterdam. The tram was nicknamed &quot;Het Moordenaartje&quot; (The Little Murderer) because of the high rate of casualties involved with its operation.

<text>Reeuwijk () is a former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The former municipality covers an area of 50.11 km2 (of which 11.89 km2 is water). Since January 1, 2011 Reeuwijk merged with Bodegraven to Bodegraven-Reeuwijk.

The former municipality of Reeuwijk includes the communities of Driebruggen, Hogebrug, Langeweide, Middelburg, Oud-Reeuwijk, Oukoop, Platteweg, Randenburg, Reeuwijk-Brug, Reeuwijk-Dorp, Sluipwijk, Tempel, Waarder and Westeinde.

==History==
Reeuwijk was established as a good location for peat harvesting. The earliest known reference to the town is from 1248.

The area prospered in the 18th century when layers of peat were dug up, dried, and used as fuel for industries in Gouda. Eventually these peat quarries struck a fresh-water spring, forming the Reeuwijk Ponds (&quot;Reeuwijkse Plassen&quot;). Reeuwijk added neighboring municipalities: in 1855, Middelburg was added, in 1857, Oukoop, in 1870, Sluipwijk and Stein.

On January 1, 1989, when the municipality Driebruggen (formed in 1964) was dissolved, its communities Waarder and Driebruggen were added to Reeuwijk.

<text>Rijnsburg () is a village in the eastern part of the municipality of Katwijk, in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. It lies on the Oude Rijn, from which it takes its name.

==History==
Rijnsburg used to be a separated municipality until 1 January 2006, when, together with Valkenburg, it was added to the municipality of Katwijk. Before that, the municipality covered an area of of which was water, and had a population of 14851 inhabitants (1 June 2005).

Rijnsburg&#x27;s main claim to fame is that the philosopher Spinoza lived there from 1661 to 1663. The modest house in which he lived is still preserved, and can be visited.

Rijnsburg is located in an area called the &quot;Dune and Bulb district&quot; (Duin- en Bollenstreek) and is one of the locations of the flower auction company Royal FloraHolland.

Rijnsburg Abbey was established by Petronilla of Lorraine, consort of Floris II, Count of Holland, in 1133. It flourished for many years. Two of her granddaughters, Sophie and Hedwig, would later join this abbey, one of them as abbess.

=== Archeological finds ===
In 1913 a buckle, the mount with red, white and blue enamel, and the square coin were found together in a cemetery at Rijnsburg. The impressive gilded buckle with interwoven filigree and enamel inlay was probably made in Kent (England) across the Channel. These finds amongst others indicate that the mouth of the Rhine was home to some people of very high status, perhaps even royalty.

===Burials at Rijnsburg Abbey===
* Floris the Black
* Petronilla of Lorraine
* Dirk VI, Count of Holland
* William I, Count of Holland
* Floris IV, Count of Holland

<text>Rijswijk (), formerly known as Ryswick ( ) in English, is a town and municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. Its population was 59.642 in 2024, and it has an area of , of which is water.

The municipality also includes the former hamlets of &#x27;t Haantje and Sion, currently also known as RijswijkBuiten.

==Demographics==
62% Dutch background, 
38% No Dutch background.

== History ==
Archeological excavations indicate that this area of the coastal dunes was already inhabited some 5500 years ago. The village of Rijswijk formed in the 13th century, and its history was dominated by the presence of mansions and estates of the nobility and affluent.

The Treaty of Ryswick was signed at the Huis ter Nieuwburg in 1697, ending the Nine Years&#x27; War. A monument, the Needle of Rijswijk (1792), was erected to commemorate the treaty in the Rijswijk Forest.
Until 1900 Rijswijk remained a relative small community but it became urbanized during the 20th century when it expanded rapidly. Today, Rijswijk&#x27;s area has almost been completely built-up. The last major development is the new Ypenburg neighbourhood, built on the lands of the former Ypenburg Airfield but this part of Rijswijk was annexed by The Hague in 2002. Rijswijk is part of the Haaglanden conurbation. During the years its built-up area has grown to the point where it has effectively merged with The Hague, even though it is still a separate municipality.
Up until 2009 Rijswijk had a polytechnic college for applied sciences; TH Rijswijk (Technische Hogeschool Rijswijk). After a merger with the Haagse Hogeschool, this was moved to the campus of the TUDelft in Delft. The building still remains.

Istana Negara, one of the six presidential palaces of Indonesia, in the Jakarta neighbourhood of Harmoni (formerly Rijswijk-Molenvliet), was called &quot;Paleis te Rijswijk&quot; during Dutch colonial times.

<text>Rozenburg () is a town and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The municipality had a population of 13,173 in 2004, and covers an area of 6.50 km2 (of which 1.99 km2 water). It was the second-smallest municipality in the Netherlands in area (behind Bennebroek). On 10 July 2008, the local council decided to disband the municipality and to form a submunicipality of Rotterdam. This was ratified on 27 October 2009 by the Eerste Kamer (the Dutch Senate), and came into effect on 18 March 2010.
The town is located on the former island by the same name: Rozenburg Island. Its current form was created out of three separate parts: Rozenburg proper (a former sand bar between Het Scheur and Brielse Maas – part of the Nieuwe Maas river – both being branches of the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta), the sand bar Welplaat, and the southernmost part of the Hook of Holland (which was cut off from mainland Holland by the construction of the Nieuwe Waterweg ship canal in 1870 and subsequently was connected to Rozenburg when the remainder of Het Scheur was dammed off). The island is now connected to Voorne-Putten by a sea barrier and a dam.

Rozenburg Island was formed centuries ago from several sand bars in the mouth of the river Maas. In 1568 construction started on the first set of dikes and in 1586 the land known as &quot;Roosenburgh&quot; was leased to Dirk Ariensz. Bisdommer and Son, the first permanent inhabitant of Rozenburg.

In 1950, the Nieuwe Maas (or Brielse Maas) was dammed off at both ends of Rozenburg Island, thereby forming Brielse Meer and connecting it to Voorne-Putten Island.

Beginning in the same period, most of the island was given to industrial enterprise, part of the Port of Rotterdam (Botlek and Europoort). When these sea ports were being planned in the 1950s, the councils of Rotterdam and Rozenburg made the arrangement that Rotterdam would lead the development of the ports and industry, whereas Rozenburg would take care of housing development for the expected population increase. The village of Blankenburg on the island had to be completely removed to make way for new canals and industry. The new housing developments were concentrated around the old village centre of Rozenburg on Het Scheur. In a short period, its population rose from 3500 to over 14000.

The Hook of Holland bit was extended with a large polder called Maasvlakte, which contains large sea harbours and petrochemical industry.

There is a refinery located in Rozenburg. The Rozenburg refinery is now owned by Kuwait Petroleum Europort BV which is a subsidiary of Kuwait Petroleum International, KPI.

<doc id="121185" wikidata="Q1615386" url="?curid=121185" title="Sassenheim">
<text>Sassenheim () is a town and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland.

The former municipality covered an area of 6.62 km2 (of which 0.23 km2 water) and had a population of 14,906 in 2005. Since 1 January 2006, it is part of the Teylingen municipality. In 2020, the population reached 15,755.
The name &quot;Sassenheim&quot; consists of two parts; the first (&quot;Sassen&quot;) means Saxons, and the second portion (&quot;heim&quot;) is Old Frankish for &quot;home&quot;.

==History==

The name Sassenheim is mentioned in documents for the first time in 870 as &quot;Hostsagnem&quot; (&#x27;East Sassenheim&#x27;) and &quot;Westsagnem&quot; (&#x27;West Sassenheim&#x27;). Later, in the 10th century, the name Saxnem, Zassenem or Sassem was used. It was formed between the towns of Leiden and Lisse on the eastern edge of the old coastal beach ridges where the main road from Leiden to Haarlem was located. Along this road many castles and estates were built, including the mansions along Sassenheim&#x27;s Main Street (&quot;Hoofdstraat&quot;) dating from the early 1900s. The village church is built on a dune top and portrays a variety of construction styles. Sassenheim is located in an area called the &quot;Dune and Bulb Region&quot; (Duin- en Bollenstreek). Historically, Sassenheim had a large bulbflower industry but this has now all but disappeared, only a few fields remain.

One of the most interesting attractions in Sassenheim are the ruins of Castle Teylingen. This stronghold was built to guard the north–south route in Holland and later became a residence of countess Jacoba of Bavaria. Its outer walls date from the beginning of the 13th century. Around 1570 during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the castle was heavily damaged but rebuilt afterwards. It was bought by the State in 1889 and restored in 1900.

Since World War II it has placed much emphasis on attracting light industry. The territory of Sassenheim is partly used for this purpose and partly for residential construction. The few bulbs lands owned by the municipality, have virtually disappeared. The many bulbs barns are almost all demolished. Trade and production have moved to areas outside Sassenheim. In the second half of the 20th century Sassenheim becomes a greater town with new districts around the historical town center, first in the Southeast and the West (during the 60s-70s) and later in the rest of the village.

On December 11, 2011 Sassenheim Train station has opened near the motorway A44.

<text>Schipluiden is a village in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. It is the seat of the council of the municipality of Midden-Delfland.

The village was founded relatively late in the 15th century and evolved around the Keenenburg castle, which no longer exists. The current Dutch Reformed church in the village centre belonged to the Catholic Teutonic Knights before 1572, when the Calvinists took over control of the church. The village inhabitants worked in the food trade from the agrarian area Westland to the cities of Vlaardingen and Delft. Most of the population became Roman Catholic in the 17th century. For sermons, they had to go to the Roman Catholic Church, some kilometres out of the village.

In 1855, the municipality of Sint Maartensregt was merged into Schipluiden.

A new Roman Catholic church was built in the 1960s. Schipluiden remained a small agrarian village until the 1950s. Its population began to grow significantly in the second half of the twentieth century as many middle-class people from the cities came to live in the village, but the village has maintained its village culture.

Schipluiden was a separate municipality until 2004, when it became part of Midden-Delfland.

<doc id="121188" wikidata="Q478036" url="?curid=121188" title="Schoonhoven">
<text>Schoonhoven () is a city and was a former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. Since 2015 it has been a part of the municipality of Krimpenerwaard, before it had been an independent municipality.

The former municipality had a population of in , and covered an area of of which water. From 2010 to 2014, it was the smallest municipality in the Netherlands in land area, following the merger of Rozenburg into Rotterdam.

The first winner of the Dutch version of Pop Idol, Jamai Loman, is from this city. Also Jan-Arie van der Heijden, football player for Feyenoord, lives in Schoonhoven.

==History==
 a castle was built on the north side of a small stream called &quot;Zevender&quot;, near its mouth at the Lek River. The town Schoonhoven was then formed near the castle. The oldest reference to the town is in a document from 1247, where it is referred to as &quot;Sconhoven&quot;. In 1280, it was granted town rights.

Around 1350, walls and gates were constructed around the city. The city&#x27;s economy depended on shipping, brewing, fishing and agriculture. Schoonhoven was also the marketplace for the region. In 1518, the castle burned down and its remains were removed in subsequent decades.

Between 1582 and 1601 the city&#x27;s defense walls were renewed and expanded to include the shipyards as well. At this point, the fortifications mainly faced eastward (as can be seen on the 1652 map of Schoonhoven by Joan Blaeu), because of the historically strategical location on the border between the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht. Following the Disaster Year of 1672, they were reinforced once again and expanded on the west and north sides. Yet in 1816, when bastion fortifications were no longer relevant to the warfare of the time, they were mostly demolished and made way for a cemetery and a park. Nowadays, most of the town walls and gates too have disappeared. The only remaining medieval entrance gate of Schoonhoven is the &quot;Veerpoort&quot; (Ferry Gate) that faces the Lek River. This &quot;Veerpoort&quot; has protected Schoonhoven from the floods of the river Rhine and from the sea during the devastating North Sea flood of 1953 and is still fully functional as a water barrier today.

By 1860, the city had 2900 inhabitants. Not until the middle of the 20th century did the city expand beyond the former fortress limits; firstly in a north-westerly direction, and then eastward since the 1990s.

==Tourism and attractions==
Schoonhoven is known for its silver and therefore carries the nickname: &quot;Zilverstad&quot; (&quot;Silver City&quot;). Since the 17th century, silver and gold smiths have been working here. Today, Schoonhoven is still known for its silver. It is the host of &quot;Het Nederlands Zilvermuseum&quot; (the Dutch Silver Museum) and the International Silver School.

Schoonhoven is also known for is its production of clocks. There still is a variety of clock makers in Schoonhoven, some of which can be visited. A beautiful example of a large clockwork is the &quot;Van den Gheyn Beiaard&quot; in the tower of the medieval town hall of Schoonhoven.

The city is a popular stop for inland cruise ships, especially during the summer period. Tourists are often offered a guided tour of the city and its museums, or a relaxing cycling day trip through Schoonhoven&#x27;s rural surroundings. The city is also popular among Dutch day-trippers and bicycle tourers. The grassy polders of the Krimpenerwaard, Lopikerwaard and Alblasserwaard surrounding the city of Schoonhoven are home to a magnificent variety of birds such as storks.

Popular events that take place in Schoonhoven include the annual well-visited Silver day (&quot;Zilverdag&quot;) on Whit Monday and &quot;Spookhoven&quot;, a celebration of Halloween. Also, Koningsdag and the arrival of Sinterklaas are celebrated each year.

Schoonhoven has two main shopping streets with a variety of shops and boutiques. There are several restaurants and bars, as well as a hotel and a discotheque.

== Transport ==
Schoonhoven lies in the middle of the Dutch Green Heart (&quot;Groene Hart&quot;), which is mostly a rural area with a relatively low population density. It therefore has no railway connection (although there was a tram connection with Gouda from 1914 until 1942, when it was broken up by the German Nazi authorities) and lacks a direct connection to a motorway. The city can be reached within half an hour from the major cities of Rotterdam and Utrecht via the N210 road, and from Gouda via the N207. It also has a frequent bus connection (lines 295 and 497) with these cities. Amsterdam is about an hour away by car.

A ferry transporting both vehicles and pedestrians across the Lek River connects Schoonhoven with Gelkenes in the municipality of Molenwaard. From here, the cities of Gorinchem, Dordrecht and the town of Kinderdijk can each be reached within half an hour.

<text>Spijkenisse () is a large town in the province of South Holland, Netherlands. Following an administrative reform in 2015, it is part of the municipality of Nissewaard, and has a population of 72,500. It covers an area of of which is water. It is part of the Greater Rotterdam area.

==History==

Archaeological evidence suggests that the area around Spijkenisse has been inhabited for several thousand years. The area&#x27;s prehistoric inhabitants depended on fishing in the Maas and hunting in the surrounding swamps for sustenance.

The oldest known reference to the name &quot;Spickenisse&quot; is in a source from 1231. Spijkenisse is a portmanteau of the words &quot;&quot; (spit) and &quot;nesse&quot; (nose) meaning &quot;pointy nose.&quot; The name is a reference to the settlement&#x27;s location on a spit of land protruding into the river.

Spijkenisse formed as a farming and fishing village on a creek along the Oude Maas. It originally belonged to the Lord of Putten (whose coat of arms is now used by the town) but in 1459 the fiefdom of Putten, including Spijkenisse, was transferred to Philip III, Duke of Burgundy. In 1581, after the Dutch declaration of independence, the area came under the control of the States of Holland and West Friesland.

In the 16th century, the village suffered several floods, and endured destructive fires in the following two centuries which hampered its economic growth. In the 20th century Spijkenisse heavily urbanised as part of the Greater Rotterdam area. Contemporary Spijkenisse includes the communities of Hekelingen, Den Hoek, and Beerenplaat.

==Transport==
Spijkenisse has a connection to the city of Rotterdam by Rotterdam Metro lines C and D, through Spijkenisse Centrum, Heemraadlaan and De Akkers stations. The metro is operated by RET.

On 2 November 2020, at about 00:30, a train ran through buffers at the end of the line and was saved from plunging 10 metres by the &quot;Whale tails&quot; sculpture.

There are also several bus services operated by EBS and 1 line of Connexxion to Ouddorp.

In 2011, the town built seven bridges designed by Robin Stam, replicating Robert Kalina&#x27;s fictional designs on the euro banknotes.

The Vlist was formerly used as a drainage basin for polders around the river; there were many windmills on the banks of the river, to pump water out of the adjacent polders and into the river. It was also used for the transport of goods, particularly from Schoonhoven to Utrecht.
Today the river has a larger function in tourism, and is particularly popular among cyclists and pedestrians, who enjoy walking or riding along the river. The river itself is often navigated with canoes which can be rented in Haastrecht. If the river is sufficiently frozen in winter, the Two Provinces skating tour is organized for the ice-skate enthusiasts.

== Arrest at Goejanverwellesluis ==
Famously, along the river Vlist, Wilhelmina of Prussia, was halted by patriots from Gouda while on her way to The Hague. She was planning to attempt to convince the States General to let her husband William V return to the city. The patriots tried to prevent this and she was then brought to a farm near the Goejanverwellesluis (in present Hekendorp). Afterwards, she was not allowed further passage into Holland and returned to Nijmegen without result. This event, that directly led to the invasion of the Dutch Republic by Frederick William II of Prussia and the fall of the patriots, occurred on June 28, 1787, and is (incorrectly, because it happened at Bonrepas) known as the &quot;Arrest at Goejanverwellesluis&quot;.

<text>Voorhout () is a village and former municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The former municipality covered an area of of which is covered by water, and had a population of 14,792 in 2004. Together with Sassenheim and Warmond, it became part of the Teylingen municipality on January 1, 2006. Voorhout is located in an area called the &quot;Dune and Bulb Region&quot; (Duin- en Bollenstreek).

It also included the communities of Piet Gijzenbrug (partly) and Teijlingen with the Slot Teylingen.

==History==

In 1988 Voorhout celebrated its 1000th anniversary. A letter mentioning Voorhout from 988 states that count Dirk II of Holland granted the church of “Foranholte” (the old name of Voorhout) to Egmond Abbey. The second part of the name –holte or –hout (meaning “wood”) is a reference to the dune area that was supposedly very wooded at the time. Settlements arose around this area, and Voorhout arose in front of a forest. The nearby Noordwijkerhout also refers to this forest, just like Holland, which is a degeneration of Holtland, meaning woodland.

The area was inhabited long before 988 with Roman coins having been found. In 1907 a farmer found 18 bronze axes and 1 chisel, about 3500 years old, at the Rijnsburgerweg. They are now on display in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden.

Since 1150 the nobles of Teylingen took an important role in the area. Dutch Counts regularly met at Slot Teylingen. The most important inhabitant of the castle was Jacoba van Beieren. Voorhout still remained a small settlement. In 1514 there were only 40 recorded houses.

In 1657 the Leidsevaart canal was dug, going from Haarlem to Leiden and Voorhout started to grow because of this. In 1842 the Haarlem-Leiden train line was opened and Voorhout got two halts, one in the hamlet of Piet Gijzenbrug near Noordwijk and another called Voorhout. In 1900 Voorhout had about 2000 inhabitants. After 1944 new roads were constructed and both stations closed for passenger transport. In 1960 about 5000 people lived in Voorhout. By 1988 that number had grown to 9360, the growth caused by the establishment of the new neighbourhood of Oosthout. In 1997 Voorhout got a train station again. More neighborhoods were constructed and the population continued to grow. On January 1, 2005, Voorhout had 14,919 inhabitants.

Until World War II the main source of income in Voorhout was from the flower bulb industry. Today only a small proportion of the population still work in bulb cultivation. Most work outside of Voorhout. On January 1, 2006, the municipalities of Voorhout, Warmond and Sassenheim merged to form the new municipality of Teylingen to the dismay of some of the inhabitants.

The town is relatively affluent, and the majority of Voorschoten&#x27;s population are commuters, generally to either the Hague or Leiden. Despite the fact that it is situated in one of the most densely populated areas in the Netherlands, and, indeed, the world, the town retains a strong, independent identity and village-like atmosphere. Several buildings of historical importance are situated in Voorschoten. For example, the old Castle Duivenvoorde, and the Manor &quot;Vredenhof&quot; – rebuilt by Dirck Jansz Graeff, and until the 18th century in the hands of the De Graeff family – are located in or near Voorschoten.

The town&#x27;s proximity to the Hague, as well as the presence of the British School in the Netherlands in the town, and the American School of the Hague in nearby Wassenaar, means that Voorschoten has a large community of expatriates, particularly British nationals.

Floris V of Holland granted Voorschoten market rights in 1282.

In recent years, the settlement has seen considerable expansion, with the addition of several new areas of housing, such as Starrenburg, Krimwijk II and, most recently, Voorsche Park. The town benefits from excellent sporting and recreational facilities, including hockey, football and baseball clubs, a tennis club, a swimming pool and a golf course. There are a number of churches located throughout the town, the two most striking of which are the main church, located in Voorschoten&#x27;s historic centre, and the St. Laurentius Church, located in the north of the town.

A small piece of artwork named &quot;&quot; (Dutch for &#x27;The Forgotten Place&#x27;) marks the lowest point on the Dutch polders, 7.01 meters below Amsterdam Ordnance Datum.

==History==
The first reference to the area is from 1233, when on April 20, Floris IV, Count of Holland, sold an area of peat lands along the Gouwe River for 200 Dutch pounds to Nicolas of Gnepwijk, Lord of Aalsmeer and Woubrecht. The area was given the name &quot;Waddinxvene&quot;. Because of this event, Waddinxveen celebrated its 750-year anniversary in 1983.

Between 1817 and 1870, Waddinxveen was dissolved and its area split into the municipalities of Noord-Waddinxveen and Zuid-Waddinxveen. Due to further expanding, those two municipalities reunited into one.

<text>Wassenaar (; population: in ) is a municipality and town located in the province of South Holland, on the western coast of the Netherlands.

An affluent suburb of The Hague, Wassenaar lies north of that city on the N44/A44 highway near the North Sea coast. It is part of the Haaglanden region and the Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area. The municipality covers an area of , of which is covered by water.

Wassenaar is home to some of the Netherlands&#x27; richest residential neighborhoods as well as the country&#x27;s most expensive street, the &quot;Konijnenlaan&quot;.

== History ==
By tradition, the 12th-century Romanesque church in Wassenaar is the spot where the Northumbrian missionary Willibrord landed in the Netherlands; the high dunes to the west were not formed until later.

Wassenaar long remained an unremarkable small town, known only as the home of the House of Wassenaer. It only began to gain prominence in the 19th century when Louis Bonaparte ordered the construction of the &quot;Heerweg&quot; (&quot;Army Road&quot;) between The Hague and Leiden, which forms the current Rijksstraatweg. In approximately 1840, Prince Frederik had the &quot;De Paauw&quot; (Peacock) palace built, where he lived for many years; it now serves as the city hall of Wassenaar.

In 1907 a railway was built, connecting Rotterdam, The Hague, Wassenaar and Scheveningen, the course of which now forms the &quot;Landscheidingsweg&quot;. Wassenaar became attractive as a residence for wealthy people from Rotterdam. Buildings such as the monumental Huize Ivicke were constructed.

Some remnants of the Atlantic wall are located on Wassenaar&#x27;s beach, the &quot;Wassenaarseslag&quot;; nearly a thousand metres of underground walled tunnels are present, connecting five bunkers. The network now serves as a bat sanctuary and is no longer open to visits.

From September 1944 to March 1945 Wassenaar was one of launch sites used by the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for the V-2 rockets directed mainly towards London.

The American World War II and Korean War general Haywood Hansell, who helped plan the Allied bombing offensive against both Germany and Japan, lived in Wassenaar in retirement from 1957 to 1966.

In 1982 the Wassenaar Agreement between employers&#x27; organisations and trade unions in the Netherlands was signed here. This groundbreaking agreement helped in restraining wage growth in return for the adoption of policies to combat unemployment and inflation.

The Wassenaar Arrangement, a post Cold War era arms control convention, was signed here by forty member nations in May 1996.

===Modern history===

Since the days of Prince Frederik, Wassenaar has often served as an official residence: King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, his wife, Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, and their daughters lived in the villa &quot;Eikenhorst&quot; at the estate &quot;De Horsten&quot; in Wassenaar from 2003 until 2019; Princess Alexia was baptized at the Romanesque church in Wassenaar. The princesses attended the Bloemcampschool in Wassenaar, founded in 1931.

From 1970 until its relocation to Amsterdam in 2016, the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study (NIAS) which provides research time, space and support for foreign and Dutch scholars, was located in Wassenaar and the Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael, is situated in Huys Clingendael.

The U.S. Embassy The Hague as well as several ambassadorial residences are located here, including those of Canada, South Korea, Indonesia, and Ireland. In general, there is a large expatriate community of diplomats and business people in Wassenaar, largely due to its proximity to both the international organizations and embassies in The Hague. There are several international schools located in Wassenaar, including the American School of The Hague (ASH), and The International School Wassenaar, part of Rijnlands Lyceum Foundation.

Wassenaar has several parks and a network of bicycle paths. Trees, mainly beech, oak, and horse chestnut, are widespread, giving the town a green character. The town centre supports a number of high-end shops, delicatessens and bakeries as well as cafes, bars, and restaurants. There are Football, Field Hockey, Cricket, Rugby, and Tennis clubs. The theme park Duinrell and the race track Duindigt, the only remaining grass race track in the Netherlands, are also here. The art Museum Voorlinden was opened by King Willem-Alexander in 2016.

Despite being a relatively small town, Wassenaar is well known in the Netherlands for its conspicuous wealth. Areas of the town are amongst the most affluent in the Netherlands, and residents have a reputation for being &quot;bekakt&quot; or posh. Wassenaar is home to some of the most expensive neighbourhoods in the nation. In 2018 the &quot;Konijnen laan&quot; had an average house price of around 2.5 million Euros, making it the most expensive street in the Netherlands. The Dutch artists Ross and Iba released a song entitled &#x27;Wassenaar,&#x27; which poked fun at the wealth of the town.

Wassenaar has always enjoyed good relations with the neighbouring town of Voorschoten, with which it has shared a history. The House of Wassenaer, for example, historically resided in the Kasteel Duivenvoorde in Voorschoten. A merger into one municipality has been discussed.

<text>Zoetermeer () is a city in the Western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. The municipality covers an area of of which is water. A small village until the late 1960s, it had 6,392 inhabitants in 1950. By 2023 this had grown to 126.998, making it the fourth largest population centre in the province of South Holland, after Rotterdam, The Hague and Leiden. While now a city in its own right, Zoetermeer started out as a suburb of The Hague and is still a part of the Greater The Hague urban area.

The name Zoetermeer (Dutch for &quot;freshwater lake&quot;) refers to the former lake north of the town (reclaimed in 1614). Because the name literally translates as &quot;sweet lake&quot; local residents have dubbed Zoetermeer &quot;Sweet Lake City&quot;.

==History==

The Zoetermeer Archaeological Working Group has found some Roman shards, but they are so few that it is not clear whether Zoetermeer already existed in Roman times. Excavation did find older animal material. During the extraction of sand for the new housing estates, bones of mammoths, aurochs and saber-toothed tigers surfaced from great depths. Those animals walked around here ten to a hundred thousand years ago.

The village of Zoetermeer is more than a thousand years old. In the Middle Ages, farmers dug so-called valley holes. The clay from those holes was used to improve their peatland. At the bottom of one such hole, Zoetermeer archaeologists found a carved wooden pole a few years ago, dating back to the year 985.

Zoetermeer used to have to pay a certain tax, the botting, to the Count of Holland. It is known that only the oldest towns in this province paid that tax. This shows that Zoetermeer must have been founded at least before 1100. The first written evidence for the existence of a village on the site of present-day Zoetermeer is found in 1269. Count Floris V then gave away part of the tax revenue here as a dowry.

In the 13th century a village center was formed, which still exists as the historic Dorpsstraat. Until the 17th century there was a lake called the Zoetermeer. A reminder of this is the &quot;Zoetermeerse Plas&quot; in the Noord Aa recreation area at the northern edge of town; this artificial lake was created when tons of sand were needed to lay the foundation for new housing development, and the area north of Zoetermeer was a good source of this resource.

After the foundation of Zoetermeer, the settlement Zegwaart arose at the site of the present Zegwaartseweg. It was probably named after the sedge-covered worth, a low-lying area, where most people went to live. In the 13th century the settlement centers moved from Langeland and Zegwaartseweg to Dorpsstraat. In 1296 there was probably already a church on the site where the Oude Kerk now stands. Zoetermeer and Zegwaart remained independent, but formed one parish.

Zoetermeer developed more prosperously over the centuries than Zegwaart. That village suffered relatively often from fires and floods. On May 1, 1935, both municipalities were merged into the present municipality of Zoetermeer. Seghwaert, an older way of spelling of Zegwaard, is now the name of a neighbourhood outside the old village centre.

Zoetermeer began to grow slightly when the first train service came around 1868. A few decades later the Numico factory started near the station. The real growth started in 1966, when there was an urgent need of houses from people around The Hague. From then they started to build new quarters around the old village centre, so Zoetermeer began to grow and became a city in the meantime.

Although contemporary Zoetermeer has the image of a modern city, there are still remains of the past. Like the old village centre with its small houses and the church with late medieval 15th-century clock tower (on picture, wooden top from 1642), and the old farms, surrounded by modern houses nowadays.

Lake Dobbe divides the old town from the new city centre, with the medieval village centre on one side of the lake and the modern high-rise and skyscrapers on the other side.

==Neighbourhoods==
Zoetermeer is divided into 6 neighbourhoods (wijken), which cover most of the municipality&#x27;s territory, with the remainder being the commercial area in the east and the mostly green and undeveloped &quot;Buitengebied&quot; in the west. Every neighbourhood has at least one (smaller) shopping mall and (except for Noordhove) a tram stop. Each neighbourhood consists of one or more &quot;wijken&quot;, each of which has a separate postcode with differing last two digits following &quot;27&quot;, from within Zoetermeer&#x27;s 2710-2729 assigned postcodes (2700, 2701 and 2702 are used for post-office boxes and the rest are not used )

These neighbourhoods have the following names (in brackets the year the neighbourhood was designated, although some of the neighbourhood already existed before designation):
=== Meerzicht (1969) ===
Literally meaning &quot;lake view&quot;, Meerzicht is divided by the RandstadRail light rail tracks into Meerzicht-Oost (postcode 2715), with taller block of flats, and Meerzicht-West (postcode 2716) with low-rise residential development. Further to the west is the water-rich, 280-hectare urban park and recreation area Westerpark.

=== Buytenwegh de Leyens (1974) ===
The development of this area marked the shift to the development of single-family homes with private gardens more popular with Dutch families of that and coming decades, and encompasses the much older settlements of Buytenwegh (postcode 2717) and De Leyens (postcode 2725), and an area called &quot;Buytenwegh de Leyens&quot; per se (postcode 2726).

=== Centrum (1978) ===
The construction of a new centre of Zoetermeer actually started only in 1981, to serve as a shopping and administrative heart of the city. It followed modern urban planning principles, placing parking garages, some storage facilities and a RandstadRail station on the ground level, which is covered by pedestrian- and bicycle-only area with shops on the lower floors and apartments above them, to ensure the centre does not die out outside of the business hours.

The centre was completed in phases, the last one being the Cadenza residential development in 2017. The Stadscentrum has two RandstadRail stations. The Centrum-West station is the terminus of RandstadRail line 3 and is the locations of Zoetermeer&#x27;s busiest bus station. The Stadscentrum includes the modern town hall of Zoetermeer and the local police station. A small lake called &quot;Grote Dobbe&quot; is placed directly in between Stadscentrum and Dorp, with the promenades and bicycle paths along the lake connecting the old and the new centres of Zoetermeer. The postcode for Stadscentrum is 2711.

=== Noordhove &amp; Seghwaert (1986) ===
Noordhove (postcode 2728) is located between Seghwaert to the south and the artificial lake known as &#x27;Zoetermeerse Plas&#x27; to the north. Unlike the other &quot;wijken&quot;, it has no dedicated RandstadRail station, as both RandstadRail track branches run to the south of it.

=== Rokkeveen (1987) ===
Rokkeveen is separated from the other &quot;wijken&quot; by the A12 motorway and the Den Haag-Gouda railway line. As such, it enjoys direct access to Zoetermeer&#x27;s railway stations and features numerous crossings under or over both transport corridors to allow access to the rest of Zoetermeer. Rokkeveen is further divided into Rokkeveen-Oost and Rokkeveen-West. A significant turning point in the development of this part of town was the Floriade 1992, which took place there.

Rokkeveen-Oost (postcode 2718) extends between the railway stations Zoetermeer-Oost and Zoetermeer. The &quot;Mandelabrug&quot; (Nelson Mandela bridge) was built over the latter for the Floriade (replacing an earlier smaller bridge, deemed insufficient for the increased traffic) as a covered bicycle and pedestrian passage over the railway, motorway and the RandstadRail, which adjoins it at this point from the North. The &quot;Mandelabrug&quot; connects the train station, the Randstadrail station Driemanspolder and the &quot;wijken&quot; of Rokkeveen-Oost and Driemanspolder. Next to the Mandelabrug runs a road crossing - a bridge between Afrikaweg on the northern side and Zuidweg in Rokkeveen.

The other crossing are the road, pedestrian and bicycle tunnels between Tweede and Eerste Stationsstraat next to Zoetermeer-Oost train station, connecting Rokkeveen-Oost with Dorp. The historic water tower &quot;De Tien Gemeenten&quot; is also now located in Rokkeveen-Oost.

Rokkeveen-West (postcode 2719) mainly encompasses newer development on the grounds of the former Floriade-park, which includes both residential and office buildings.

=== Oosterheem (1999) ===
Oosterheem is the newest district of Zoetermeer, a Vinex-location and the source of Zoetermeer&#x27;s most recent and continuing growth, which allowed it to become the third most populous municipality in South Holland. The districts development was not without problematic issues and delays, stemming first from the concerns over the environmental impacts of such development, and later from the planning and construction of HSL-Zuid, which now forms the district&#x27;s and municipality&#x27;s eastern border. An enduring concern is an old pipeline, now used for the transportation of pressurized CO2, which runs through Oosterheem.

Oosterheem is served by three stations on RandstadRail line 4, whose tracks branch out from the original RandstadRail loop in Seghwaert. It is further divided into Oosterheem-Oost (postcode 2721) and Oosterheem-West (postcode 2729).

=== Wijkposten ===
Zoetermeer has a network of &quot;wijkposten&quot; (&quot;neighbourhood stations&quot;), which provide more direct contacts between the municipality and the inhabitants of the neighbourhoods. The &quot;wijkposten&quot; employ personnel to deal with housing issues and provide space for local police officers. There are six &quot;wijkposten&quot; throughout Zoetermeer. Buytenwegh de Leyens, Meerzicht, Oosterheem and Rokkeveen have a &quot;wijkpost&quot; each, while Noordhove and Seghwaert share a common station and &quot;Wijkpost Center&quot; serves Dorp, Driemanspolder, Palenstein and Stadscentrum, which are for some purposes also lumped together as &quot;Zoetermeer Centrum&quot;.

=== Other Former Neighbourhoods ===

==== Dorp (1962) ====
Literally meaning &quot;village&quot;, this &quot;wijk&quot; covers mostly the territory of the pre-existing village of Zoetermeer, with the central &quot;Dorpstraat&quot; (village street) with historic buildings serving as a shopping and recreation area. The area also features the historic &quot;De Hoop&quot; windmill, which unlike many other windmills in the area used for drainage, has always been used as a flourmill. The postcode for Zoetermeer-Dorp is 2712.

==== Driemanspolder (1965) ====
Driemanspolder (postcode 2713) was the first area to be developed as part of modern Zoetermeer, and contains mostly large multi-apartment buildings characteristic of the era. It is next to the A12 motorway, which forms the southern border of the &quot;wijk&quot;, and directly north of the Zoetermeer railway station (which is on the other side of A12).

==== Palenstein (1966) ====
Palenstein (postcode 2722) is north of the Dorp, deriving its name from the former Castle of Palenstein, which used to be there. It mainly consists of highrise residential development. A rejuvenation project was started in Palenstein in 2006, providing for the renovation of some and demolition of other older buildings.

==== Seghwaert (1975) ====
Seghwaert was formed around what was the former village of Zegwaart (or Zegwaard), which fused with Zoetermeer in 1935, using the archaic spelling of the locale&#x27;s name. The old Zegwaart was a ribbon development along what remains until today as &quot;Zegwaartseweg&quot;, which is perpendicular to &quot;Dorpstraat&quot;. It is further divided into Seghwaert-Oost (postcode 2723), -Midden (postcode 2724) and -Noord (postcode 2727).

==Economy==

Zoetermeer&#x27;s economy is primarily dependent and revolving around Information technology. With modern infrastructure, a highly digitised centre called &#x27;het Forum&#x27; that houses city hall, the central library and numerous other organisations, and many schools that offer IT-related education, it also is a major software development centre, with many software developers based here. There are a large number of IT companies with branches in Zoetermeer, like Siemens, which has its Dutch Tech Campus in Zoetermeer, and Toshiba Medical Systems Europe BV. 20% of the population of Zoetermeer has an IT-related job. The local government designates a comparatively large part of the budget to computers for schools.

To stress the IT tradition of Zoetermeer, the city is the first in the world to have a city hall in Second Life.

==Transport==

===Light rail===
The former Zoetermeer Stadslijn urban railway was rebuilt as light rail in 2006/2007. The stadslijn was the only urban railway in The Netherlands. It had 12 stations in Zoetermeer and ran to and from The Hague Central Station.

The new light rail system is part of the RandstadRail network between The Hague, Rotterdam and Zoetermeer. Besides the rebuilt original Stadslijn, which now has 13 stations, the added Oosterheemlijn leads to the new suburb Oosterheem. The Oosterheemlijn has five stations and ends at the heavy rail Station Lansingerland-Zoetermeer.

===Heavy rail===
Zoetermeer has three stations on the main railway between The Hague and Utrecht. Zoetermeer-Zegwaard, built when the city was connected by railway in 1868, burnt down in 1906. Later the station reopened 1965 on the same location as Zoetermeer-Oost. The main station, Zoetermeer station, was opened in 1973. Lastly, the newest station, Station Lansingerland-Zoetermeer, was completed in May 2019.

The HSL-Zuid high speed line from Amsterdam to Paris passes Zoetermeer on its eastern side. Although there have been proposals to open a station on the line, this seems highly unlikely this will be realized.

===Motorway===
Zoetermeer is next to the A12 motorway, connecting The Hague with Utrecht, Arnhem and Germany.

==Religion==
Zoetermeer is the only place in the Netherlands with a temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is situated near the old village centre.

==Entertainment and recreation==
This former new town used to be a satellite city of The Hague, as many residents worked, shopped and were entertained in The Hague. With the growth of Zoetermeer came a large theatre, mega cinema, and other entertainment such as go-karts, laser gaming, survival centre, and a golf centre. 

===Museums===
The city has two museums, Museum deVoorde and the National Videogame Museum. In 2022, subsidy for Museum deVoorde was stopped by the local government because of low visitor numbers after the COVID19-pandemic. 

===SnowWorld===

SnowWorld was the first indoor ski slope made of real snow in Europe, opened in 1996. It now has three slopes, of which the slope is the longest. Plans are being made to extend this to . Open since December 2016, SnowWorld attracts over a million visitors each year, making it the most important tourist attraction in Zoetermeer.

===Dutch Water Dreams===
Dutch Water Dreams (DWD) was an artificial Olympic wild water rafting circuit. It was a copy of the one built in China for the 2008 Olympic Games and was mainly used for training by European rafting teams, and also for team building and recreation. DWD also had an indoor Flowrider centre. Dutch Water Dreams closed in 2015.

===Silverdome===
Silverdome is an indoor Olympic ice skating track and convention centre. It is used as a training centre for the KNSB, the Dutch Olympic and world championship ice skaters. It is also home to the only curling rink in the Netherlands. Outside the skating season it is used as a convention centre and concert hall and for large raves.

===Parks===
Zoetermeer has many parks, the biggest being the &quot;Westerpark&quot; on the west side of town. It is almost as large as Central Park in New York. Other notable parks are the &quot;Buytenpark&quot;, the &quot;Aldo van Eyckpark&quot;, the &quot;Binnenpark&quot;, the &quot;Van Tuyllpark (with Dutch Water Dreams and Aquapark Keerpunt), the &quot;Hoekstrapark&quot;, the &quot;Wilhelminapark&quot;, the &quot;floriade park&quot;, the &quot;Seghwaertse Hout&quot; and the &quot;Seghwaertpark&quot;.

At the north side there is a lake, the &quot;Zoetermeerse Plas&quot;, often called &quot;Noord Aa&quot; because it is in the Noord Aa Recreational Area. There is a beach along one side of the lake and a marina on the other. Wind- and kite surfing, sailing and fishing are the most popular activities on the lake.

On both the west and east side of the city forests are being planted, called &quot;Balijbos&quot; (west side) and Bentwoud (east side). These forests are intended to form a &quot;natural&quot; barrier between The Hague and Zoetermeer.

==Topography==

==History==

The name Zoeterwoude is first mentioned in a document from 1205, which references a certain &quot;Florentius van Sotrewold&quot;. It is uncertain if this is a reference to the village. The first confirmed existence is from 1276 when Dirk van Santhorst received the &quot;Soetrewold&quot; fiefdom from Floris V, Count of Holland.

Its municipal boundaries were set circa 1300. At that time it was one of the largest municipalities in the Netherlands, but later much land was annexed by surrounding cities, notably Leiden. In 1450, the first bridge between Leiderdorp and Zoeterwoude was built. In 1574, Zoeterwoude was burnt to the ground and its polders inundated by Leideners in order to increase the range of the city&#x27;s cannons. Almost no inhabitants remained in Zoeterwoude.

Around 1650, Zoeterwoude had been almost rebuilt and 50 years later it was prospering. After 1800, Leiden started a long series of annexations, reducing the land area of Zoeterwoude.

In 1960, the A4 motorway was built and since 1966 it has been the municipal boundary between Leiden and Zoeterwoude.

==History==
Thief River Falls takes its name from a geographic feature, the falls of the Red Lake River at its confluence with the Thief River. The name of the river is a loose translation of the Ojibwe phrase &quot;Gimood-akiwi ziibi&quot;, literally, the &quot;Stolen-land river&quot; or &quot;Thieving-land river&quot;, which originated when a band of Dakota Indians occupied a secret encampment along the river, hence &quot;stealing&quot; the land, before being discovered and routed by the neighboring Ojibwe. In the Treaty of Old Crossing of 1863, the &quot;Moose Dung&#x27;s Indian Reservation&quot; was established on the west bank of the Thief River, at its confluence with Red Lake River. This Indian Reservation was dissolved in 1904 and their population incorporated as part of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa.

Thief River Falls marked the limit of navigation on the Red Lake River. The eponymous town site was established in 1887 and later incorporated as a city in 1896. Thief River Falls first developed as a lumber-milling town. It is located in a major agriculture area because of the rich soil left by ancient Glacial Lake Agassiz. The Great Northern and the Soo Line railroads brought prosperity when Thief River Falls became a center for shipping wheat.

==Geography==

==Economy==

Thief River Falls (and surrounding region) has been home to major industry including snowmobiles, farm machinery, and global electronics distribution. The town is the home of snowmobile manufacturer Arctic Cat. South of Thief River Falls is a casino, 7 Clans Casino, which also contains a hotel and indoor water park. Thief River Falls is home to the electronic parts distributor Digi-Key, one of the largest employers in the area, and was the birthplace of the vaunted Steiger Tractor, produced from 1958 to the late 1980s. Thief River Falls was home to the headquarters of the Cycle Detection Warning System up until its shutdown on April 13, 2009.

===Rivers and rails===
Thief River Falls is situated on the junction of two rivers, Red Lake River from the east-southeast and the Thief River from the north. The proximity to forests and shipping made Thief River Falls ideal for logging. In the late 19th century the Great Northern Railway was built, and in 1904, the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway (“Soo Line”) passed through on its route from Saint Paul to Winnipeg. Branches were later built to Drake, North Dakota, and Duluth, Minnesota. The Minnesota Northwestern Electric Railway, an electric-powered passenger train, ran from Thief River Falls to Goodridge between 1914 and 1940.

Today, the river and rails still power the local economy with tourism and shipping. Canadian Pacific Railway and Minnesota Northern Railroad now occupy tracks through town. To this day, Soo Line engine 1024 rests outside city hall (formerly the Soo Line Depot).

On Tuesday, August 21, 2007, the Empress Express (Canadian Pacific 2816) spent the night in front of the historic Soo Line depot in Thief River Falls. Thief River Falls Radio reported that the classic steam engine was built in 1930, and the 45 ticketed passengers were to leave for Glenwood, Minnesota, on Wednesday morning.

===Major industries===
====Snowmobiles====
Arctic Cat, Inc. can trace its roots to former Polaris Industries founder Edgar Hetteen who left Polaris in 1960 and started Polar Manufacturing in Thief River Falls. Shortly after changing name to Arctic Enterprises, the new company produced snowmobiles. Arctic Cat purchased several boat manufacturers including Spirit Marine which produced the first Wetbike in 1978. A few snowless winters in the early 1980s bankrupted the 20-year-old company, which closed its facilities by 1982. In 1984, Arctic Cat was reborn under a new company name, Arctco, which was changed to Arctic Cat in 1996. It was announced at the end of 2024 that Arctic Cat would close during the first half of 2025 in Thief River Falls.

====Electronics distribution====
Digi-Key Electronics is one of the largest electronics distributors in North America. The company started in 1972 with Dr. Ronald A. Stordahl&#x27;s interest in ham radio, which led him to assemble and sell digital electronic keyer kits to other ham radio operators for sending radiotelegraph messages. This device was called the Digi-Keyer.

====Tractors====
Steiger Tractors were invented by Douglas and Maurice Steiger from Thief River Falls during the 1950s. The brothers built their first tractor the winter of 1957–58 after seeing a need to cover their ground more efficiently. After designing and building the tractors on their farm for six years, the brothers opened a production facility in Fargo, North Dakota. A new plant built in 1974 could produce a new tractor every 18 minutes. Steiger produced many models of tractor with the main feature being the horsepower. Ford chose Steiger to manufacture the Ford tractors of the late 1970s and early &#x27;80s. As the farm economy slumped in the late 1980s, Steiger had trouble selling tractors. Steiger filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986, and was soon after sold to Tenneco, parent company of J. I. Case. Case IH continued to produce and sell Steiger tractors while introducing its own lines of 4wd tractors. Case still produces Steiger tractors at the Fargo, North Dakota, facility.

==Education==
Thief River Falls is home to Thief River Falls Public Schools, a public school district operating a high school (Lincoln High School), middle school (Franklin Middle School), and elementary school (Challenger Elementary School).

The arena is called Ralph Engelstad Arena, the same name as the University of North Dakota&#x27;s $100 million hockey arena in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Thief River Falls is also home to Northland Community and Technical College, which also has a campus in East Grand Forks, Minnesota. The college has experienced steady growth in enrollment in the past decade.

==In popular culture==
===&quot;Thief River&quot;, the play===
The celebrated American playwright Lee Blessing’s work, &quot;Thief River&quot;, premiered in 2000 at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. It subsequently ran Off-Broadway in New York in June 2001 to mixed reviews, and later had a longer run in San Francisco. The Wall Street Journal called it &quot;an old fashioned gay love story - one where love is upstaged by shame, secrecy and social defiance.&quot; It is the story of Gil and Ray, who at age 17 were secret lovers in what one reviewer called &quot;a small homophobic Minnesota town in the &#x27;40s&quot;—presumably Thief River Falls. The plot portrays a love between these two men that spans 53 years. As stated by another reviewer, &quot;The play attempted to show what it would be like to be a gay man in a small town in the late &#x27;40s, when two men kissing would have been a revolutionary act.&quot; The play most recently ran in Chicago in early 2007, where it was called &quot;the definitive work capturing the homosexual experience in the rural American Midwest over the last 50 years.&quot;. The specific Minnesota connection of the play is unstated, but playwright Blessing grew up in the Twin Cities area and attended Minnetonka High School before leaving for Reed College in Oregon in the late 1960s.

<text>Askov is a city in Pine County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 364 at the 2010 census.

Minnesota State Highway 23 serves as a main route in the community, and Interstate 35 is nearby.

==History==
The village was originally within the lands of the village of Partridge, at a stop far outside the original village along Great Northern Railway; here a post office was set up, called Partridge from 1889 to 1909, before changing its name to Askov in 1909. Most of the original village of Partridge was destroyed in the 1894 Hinckley fire. The immigrants to the Danish &quot;colony&quot; of Askov were nationalistic Lutheran followers of the theologian and cultural leader N. F. S. Grundtvig. Danish immigrants had previously been mostly economic migrants fleeing poverty, but the first migrants to Askov were almost all Grundvigian Danes from elsewhere in the U.S. The &quot;Dansk Folkesamfund&quot; (Danish Peoples Society) was founded in 1887 by Svend Hersleb Grundtvig, N. F. S. Grundtvig&#x27;s son, to conserve Danish social heritage and promote immigration to the U.S. The &quot;Dansk Folkesamfund&quot;, with help from the railroad company, bought 45 parcels of land around the train station and post office in 1906 and by 1909 had sold them exclusively to Danish settlers, some 25 families. The name &quot;Askov&quot; was chosen to commemorate the village of Askov, Denmark, the site of one of the largest folk high schools (&quot;Askov Højskole&quot;) founded by N. F. S. Grundtvig. The name Askov is derived from &quot;ash forest&quot; (&quot;ask skov&quot;) in Danish. By 1916, almost 1,000 settlers of Danish descent lived here, although 1920 U.S. census data records only 242 inhabitants in Askov; most people lived in Partridge. This was Minnesota&#x27;s largest concentration of Danish settlers. The new village was incorporated on April 25, 1918, and officially separated from the township as the City of Askov on April 8, 1921. Initially the main economic activity was dairy (the first cooperative creamery being built in 1910) supplemented by mixed intensive farming. Nearly all the streets in Askov have Danish names.

Askov&#x27;s population now has the following ancestries: German (20.8%), Irish (12.0%), Norwegian (7.3%), Danish (6.3%), Scandinavian (5.2%), American (4.7%).

The fashion brand Askov Finlayson was named after this city and neighboring Finlayson, Minnesota, which share a freeway exit on I-35.

All classes have fewer than 20 students, making the enrollment around 80 for seven grades.

Due to budget cuts, the teacher to student ratio is approximately 1/14. In 2006, classes were combined; first and second, third and fourth, and fifth and sixth grades were taught together in one room by one teacher.

; High school
The former Finlayson High School was torn down in 2004 due to instability. The last class to graduate was the class of 1990. Students who attend high school in Finlayson were moved to Hinckley High School to finish their education. Finlayson High School&#x27;s colors were maroon and gold and the mascot was a falcon. Later, the high school in Hinckley changed its name to Hinckley-Finlayson High School. Hinckley changed its mascot from the Vulcans (red and silver) to the Jaguars (red, black, and silver) during this switch. Finlayson students make a 30-minute commute to Hinckley for high school. The average class size is between 50-80 students with around 400 students total. Finlayson students make up about 18% of the school.
