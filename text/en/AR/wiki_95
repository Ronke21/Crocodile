<text>Long Beach Township is a Walsh Act Township situated on the Jersey Shore, in southeastern Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 3,153, an increase of 102 (+3.3%) from the 2010 census count of 3,051, which in turn reflected a decline of 278 (−8.4%) from the 3,329 counted in the 2000 census.

Most of the township is located on Long Beach Island, a barrier island along the Atlantic Ocean whose summer population swells to as much as 130,000, including part-time residents and tourists. In October 2012, Long Beach Township was severely affected by Hurricane Sandy, with township mayor Joe Mancini estimating that potential costs to repair the damage estimated as high as $1 billion across Long Beach Island. As a result of the storm surge, flooding and high winds, dozens of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed. After the waters receded, streets were left covered with up to four feet of sand in some spots. Governor Chris Christie issued a mandatory evacuation order on October 28, and it remained in place until a full 13 days after the storm. The township established a Sandy Relief Fund to assist residents in their recovery from the hurricane.

Long Beach Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1899, from portions of Eagleswood Township, Little Egg Harbor Township, Ocean Township, Stafford Township and Union Township (now known as Barnegat Township). Portions of the township were taken to form Barnegat City (March 29, 1904, now Barnegat Light) and Ship Bottom-Beach Arlington (March 3, 1925, now Ship Bottom). The name derives from the length of the island along Barnegat Bay.

== Education ==
For pre-kindergarten through sixth grade, public school students attend the Long Beach Island Consolidated School District, which serves students from Barnegat Light, Harvey Cedars, Long Beach Township, Ship Bottom and Surf City. As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of two schools, had an enrollment of 215 students and 30.7 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 7.0:1. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Ethel Jacobsen School in Surf City with 111 students in pre-kindergarten to second grade and 
Long Beach Island Grade School in Ship Bottom with 125 students in grades 3–6. The district&#x27;s board of education is comprised of nine members who are directly elected from the constituent municipalities on a staggered basis, with three members elected each year. Of the nine seats, four are elected from Long Beach Township.

Students in public school for seventh through twelfth grades attend the Southern Regional School District, which serves the five municipalities in the Long Beach Island Consolidated School District, along with students from Beach Haven and Stafford Township, as well as students from Ocean Township (including its Waretown section) who attend as part of a sending/receiving relationship. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Southern Regional Middle School with 902 students in grades 7–8 and 
Southern Regional High School with 1,975 students in grades 9–12. Both schools are in the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township.

At the time of its founding in 1957, the Southern Regional School District had a roughly equal number of students from Long Beach Island and Stafford Township. By 2016, the overwhelming majority of students were from Stafford Township, accounting for nearly 90% of enrollment. These demographic changes have led to significant discrepancies in the cost per pupil sent to the district from each community, with Harvey Cedars and Long Beach Township paying more than $200,000 per pupil, while Stafford Township&#x27;s costs are $3,600 for each student. These widely different costs result from a formula that uses the taxable property value in each municipality to apportion costs, which means that municipalities with relatively high property values and small numbers of students pay a higher share of total district costs. Some residents of Long Beach Island communities are seeking to amend the formula to take advantage of a 1993 law that allows districts to use both property value and enrollment to allocate property taxes, though that would require passage of referendums in each municipality.

St. Mary Academy near Manahawkin, a K–8 school of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton, is in the area. From 1997, until 2019 it operated as All Saints Regional Catholic School and was collectively managed by five churches, with one being St. Francis of Assisi Church in Brant Beach. In 2019, St. Mary Church in Barnegat took entire control of the school, which remained on the same Manahawkin campus, and changed its name. The other churches no longer operate the school but still may send students there.

Students from neighboring Lakehurst attend the district&#x27;s high school as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Lakehurst School District. As of 2012, Lakehurst has been considering the possibility of sending its students to Jackson Liberty High School, as part of a prospective agreement with the Jackson School District under which students would gain access to a broader range of academic programs and which could result in annual savings of $400,000 per year off of the $2 million that the Lakehurst district spends annually for the 150 students it sends to the Manchester district.

St. Mary Academy in Manahawkin, a K–8 school of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton, is in the area. From 1997, until 2019 it operated as All Saints Regional Catholic School and was collectively managed by five churches, with one being St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in Whiting. In 2019 St. Mary Church in Barnegat took entire control of the school, which remained on the same Manahawkin campus, and changed its name. The other churches no longer operate the school but still may send students there.

<text>Mantoloking (, ) is a coastal borough in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 331, an increase of 35 (+11.8%) from the 2010 census count of 296, which in turn reflected a decline of 127 (−30.0%) from the 423 counted in the 2000 census. The borough has an estimated summer population of approximately 5,000.

As of the 2000 census, Mantoloking was the highest-income community in the state of New Jersey with a per capita money income of $114,017 as of 1999, an increase of 29.8% from the $87,830 recorded in 1989. Based on data from the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, the borough had a per-capita income of $97,938, ranked 4th in the state. In the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine 2012 rankings of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes&quot;, the borough was ranked 139th, with a median price of $1,403,349.

Mantoloking was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 10, 1911, from portions of Brick Township. The name Mantoloking is derived from the Unami language of the Lenni Lenape Native Americans who once inhabited New Jersey. Various meanings have been attributed to the community&#x27;s name including &quot;frog ground&quot; or &quot;sand place&quot;.

The borough is a Jersey Shore community situated on the Barnegat Peninsula, also known as Barnegat Bay Island, a long, narrow barrier island that separates Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. The town is linked to the New Jersey-mainland via the Mantoloking Bridge, linking the town with Brick Township across the Barnegat Bay. Mantoloking is home to the Olympic-champion producing Mantoloking Yacht Club. Some old &quot;summer cottages&quot; in the borough were designed by architect Stanford White of McKim, Mead &amp; White. Together with Bay Head to the north, Mantoloking is considered part of the Jersey Shore&#x27;s &quot;Gold Coast&quot;. It is a dry town where alcohol is not permitted to be sold by law.

<doc id="125629" wikidata="Q1087077" url="?curid=125629" title="Mystic Island, New Jersey">
<text>Mystic Island (also called Mystic Islands or Mystic) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Little Egg Harbor Township, in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 8,301.

Mystic Island is a large, mostly waterfront development originally planned as a resort community that started in the early 1960s as a waterfront community with vacation bungalows. In the past few years, however, many of the original bungalows are slowly being replaced with much larger homes on pilings that are popular in nearby beach communities such as Long Beach Island.

==Early history==
The area that is currently Mystic Island was once called &quot;Hickory Island&quot;, and was serviced by the Tuckerton Railroad and one two-lane street named &quot;Shore Road&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Radio Road&quot; after the Tuckerton Wireless Tower.

The Tuckerton Wireless Tower () was built in 1912 by the German &quot;Hochfrequenzmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft für drahtlose Telegraphie&quot; company (The High Frequency Machine Corporation for Wireless Telegraphy, often referred to as HOMAG) when the present-day Mystic Island was called Hickory Island. The tower was used to communicate with an identical radio telegraph station in Eilvese, Germany starting on Jun 19, 1914, less than two weeks before the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. The station continued to communicate with Eilvese until America entered World War I on . It is rumored that it was used to send the message to order the attack by a German U-boat on the RMS Lusitania. After President Wilson&#x27;s Declaration of Neutrality, the President ordered the US Navy to take over the station on Sep 9, 1914 to assure the neutrality of messages sent to and from the station; however, the station continued to be operated by German nationals employed by HOMAG and continued to communicate only with the Eilvese radio station. When America entered the war, all U.S. radio stations were seized and shut down by Executive Order. The Tuckerton Radio Station was assigned to the US Navy, which used it primarily to back-up the communications of the US Navy&#x27;s main transatlantic radio station in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The remaining German personnel at Tuckerton became war prisoners and were replaced by Navy personnel when the U.S. entered the war. After the war, the Tuckerton Wireless Station was included in German war reparations paid to America. Shortly afterwards, it was sold to RCA, which operated it until 1948 as a backup to their Radio Central facility in Rocky Point, New York. In 1921, RCA installed two massive Alexanderson alternators, which were removed in 1948. For transatlantic communications, the radio station operated under the call signs WCI and WGG. For coastal communications, after World War I, the station operated under the callsign WSC. The 680-foot (820?) (865?) steel tower, anchored by three large concrete blocks, was taken down on December 27, 1955, or 1950. The three huge anchor blocks still exist today, in a backyard on North Ensign Drive, in the middle of South Ensign Drive, and Staysail Drive. Many smaller anchor blocks providing foundations for smaller towers that supported the umbrella antenna are still visible in the lagoons. Remains of the tower can be seen at the Giffordtown Museum.

===Development===

After the demise of the tower, RCA sold the Hickory Island property at a sum of $55,000 to Lagoon Parks, Inc., a land development company of the 1950s and 60s, whose corporate partners are now deceased. The development was named &quot;Mystic Islands&quot;, plural, encompassing seven small islands where the waterways were filled in to produce buildable land. Construction began slowly in 1959. The lagoons were dredged up until the early 1970s, when it was stopped by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection with the passage of CAFRA I and CAFRA II. Several unfinished lagoons can still be seen along the west end of Calabreeze Way and on the Osborn Island section. Mystic Islands only encompasses all areas south of Calabreeze Way; locals commonly refer to surrounding neighborhoods and streets as part of the community.

The first sections to be completed were the Radio Road terminus, while the Twin Lakes Boulevard section was constructed well into the 1970s. The island currently known as &quot;Osborn Island&quot; was dubbed by its developers as &quot;Oceanview&quot;, which was only accessible via a bridge on Radio Road. Up until the early 1990s, all homes part of the original were addressed by a confusing lot-and-block numbering system, which were eventually replaced with more conventional house numbers. Street signs were originally on wooden posts, with the names written vertically. They were slowly replaced with more conventional street signs, one on the corner of Twin Lakes Boulevard and Mountain Lake Drive still existed well into the late 2000s. Street signs in the Oceanview section were replaced by custom signs created by the Osborn Island Resident&#x27;s Association.

Some of the original bases of the Tuckerton Wireless tower were never removed. One is located in the backyard of a home on North Ensign Drive, while two stand on the middle of both Staysail Drive and South Ensign Drive, in which roundabouts were built around the blocks. Some smaller bases are also found in surrounding lagoons and marshes.

====Home designs====

The original home designs were basic bungalows, with 2 or 3 bedrooms and one bathroom, and a carport at the left side. The homes were intended to be sold as recreational or year round homes, as standard equipment included a furnace and Johns Manville R-7 Insulation. Over time, several more models were added, nearly a dozen during its boom period. Home designs included slab homes, raised homes, two-story, flat tops, raised roofs, etc. Two- and three-bedroom homes were also available. Model homes were located on Radio Road across from the Shops of Mystic Isle strip mall; the homes were later torn down to make way for the model homes for the Westwood development, all of which still stand and currently serve as commercial properties.

The homes were made in a warehouse on the intersection of Radio Road and Playhouse Drive, near the site of the Tuckerton Wireless tower. Buyers ordered the design by catalog, and the homes were delivered a week later. The model homes were located on Radio Road, across from the present-day &quot;Shoppes of Mystic Isle&quot; shopping center.

After the dredging of the lagoons was stopped, construction began on the non-waterfront section north of Calabreeze Way. The area east of Radio Road was named &quot;Pulaski Village&quot; and consisted of small, narrow homes, while the much larger section west of Radio Road, named &quot;Westwood&quot;, contained suburban-style ranches and split-level homes. While these areas are not officially called &quot;Mystic Islands&quot;, some homes of the original bungalow designs were constructed in these outlying areas, while at the same time, the larger, suburban homes were also offered on the original waterfront lots. However, tough economic times halted the development of the Westwood subdivision. In the early-1990s, development resumed in this unfinished area, when the empty lots were filled in with mid-size suburban homes built by several different developers. Homes on Oneida Lake Drive and Greenwood Lake Drive are part of the Noble Homes community titled &quot;Fairwinds&quot;, while most homes from Mountain Lake Drive and north were dubbed &quot;Drewes Landing&quot;. However, Drewes Landing was plagued with failed loans and racketeering, and in August 1995, one of the developers and investors, 35-year-old Joseph G. Paggi Jr. killed himself after he failed to pay back loans for the development.

==Recreation==

During the boom period of Mystic Island, there were several social centers and amenities. In the Oceanview section of the resort community, there was formerly a 9-hole golf course, bathing beach, and a small amusement park. The golf course was closed and is now a preserved forest, while the amusement park also went out of business and no longer exists. However, the beach was rebuilt and reopened as part of a townhouse community; the bathing beach is currently known as &quot;Graveling Point&quot;. A circular building at the intersection of Radio Road and Bayview Drive was originally constructed as a &quot;Boatel&quot;, where boaters could dock, eat, and even sleep. This concept didn&#x27;t last, and it later became a boat sales showroom, later a pizza parlor, and then a bar named &quot;The Rotunda&quot;. It is currently home to the Living Water Christian Center.

Diagonally from the Boatel was &quot;The Playhouse&quot;, on Playhouse Drive between Radio Road and S. Captains Drive, originally a welcome center which featured gift shops, an Olympic-sized saltwater swimming pool and marina. The building was eventually turned into a restaurant called the &quot;Mystic Island Casino&quot;, which burned down in the 1970s, and opened in a new building on Mathistown Road, which still operates to this day. The original site is now home to condominiums, the residents of which have exclusive rights to use the former marina.

The building currently home to the Little Egg Harbor Community Center on Calabreeze Way was originally a shop functioning as part of the prefabrication process. It later became a Roman Catholic church known as &quot;St. Michael the Archangel&quot;. In 2002, it was sold to the Township of Little Egg Harbor and is currently used as the township&#x27;s community center.

<text>New Egypt is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Plumsted Township, in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2010 United States Census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 2,512. The community is located at the trijunction of Burlington County, Monmouth County and Ocean counties.

==History==
There are several explanations for how New Egypt received its name. One possibility is it was a reference by George Washington in December 1776 after the victory at the Battle of Trenton. Joseph Curtis, Washington&#x27;s secretary, was sent to the town to retrieve grain for the army, and upon his return from the area, Washington exclaimed, &quot;Joseph has been to Egypt and gotten the corn.&quot; Having added &#x27;New&#x27; sometime around 1845. Other references have that the town was originally given the name &quot;Egypt&quot; in 1793 and &quot;New Egypt&quot; in 1801, the name is believed to be a biblical allusion about &quot;going to Egypt for corn&quot; that was plentiful in the area.

Around 1890, the area was once known as Timmins Mill, a reference to the mill owner who owned most of the land in the area.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of , including of land and of water (1.38%).

Author Henry Charlton Beck gave Timmins Mill the distinction of the approximate geographical center of New Jersey. Upon reading the estimate by Beck, a Christmas tree farmer used their own methods to approximate the geographic center of New Jersey to be on their farm. They have since placed a marker on the location they determined as the geographic center of New Jersey (Coordinates 40° 05’02” N Latitude 74° 32’ 01” W longitude). The marker is on their farm located across the street from the New Egypt High School.

==Community==
The community has a volunteer fire station, a first aid station, and a police department. New Egypt is also home to the New Egypt Historical Society, a clay race track called the New Egypt Speedway, and the Plumsted Branch of the Ocean County Library system.

The town also includes several Christian religious centers, Assumption Roman Catholic Church, Bethel AME Church, Accessed October 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Church of Christ, Iglesia Ni Cristo, Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, New Egypt United Methodist Church, Plumsted Presbyterian Church, the Christian Fellowship Church of New Egypt, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Oakford Lake is located in the middle of the town. In the early 1900s the location thrived as a tourist and vacation attraction.

New Egypt also has a recreation center which includes four baseball fields, a football field, two softball fields, and a basketball court and three small fields used for tee ball.

McGuire Air Force Base is immediately south of New Egypt.

<text>Ocean Township is a township located on the Jersey Shore in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 8,835, its largest ever decennial count and an increase of 503 (+6.0%) from the 2010 census count of 8,332, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,882 (+29.2%) from the 6,450 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Ocean Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 13, 1876, from portions of both Lacey Township and Union Township (now Barnegat Township). Portions of the township were taken to create Long Beach Township (March 23, 1899) and Island Beach (June 23, 1933; dissolved in 1965 and absorbed into Berkeley Township). The township derives its name from its seaside location.

Even though Waretown constitutes only one incorporated community within Ocean Township, many people use &quot;Waretown&quot; to refer to all of Ocean Township. The local custom is so widespread that it surprises some new residents that the official name is Ocean Township. Non-residents have been known to confuse Ocean Township with the Ocean Township of Monmouth County. There was a petition drive in 2006 to get a name change to Township of Waretown on the ballot but it failed to obtain enough signatures. The Waretown neighborhood is home to Albert Music Hall.

The name Waretown is derived from Abraham Weair (1683–1768), who came to the area with a colony of Rogerine Baptists (Quaker Baptists) . When the colony left the area eleven years later, Weair, who had built a sawmill, stayed behind and became a prominent member of the community.

During the American Revolutionary War, British ships sailed into the nearby Barnegat Inlet in an attempt to protect their New York-bound supply vessels from attacks by local privateers sailing schooners and whaleboats. Another British objective was to destroy Newlin&#x27;s salt works, a local supplier of a crucial commodity to the Revolutionary army, needed for food preservation and gunpowder manufacture. A massacre of local patriots occurred in October, 1782, when Captain John Bacon, loyal to the British crown, led a surprise attack on Long Beach.

During the War of 1812, the British returned to Barnegat Inlet to blockade the Jersey coast. Local privateers were caught and their schooners burned.

In the 1700s and 1800s, Waretown was a shipbuilding center. Vessels such as barques, barkentines, sloops, schooners, whaleboats and sneakboxes were constructed of white cedar native to the area. During this period, many sea captains built stately homes on bay front lots.

Around the turn of the twentieth century, Waretown fishermen sold oysters, clams and scallops to dealers such as the Fulton Fish Market in New York City. Other local industries included charcoal production, cranberry farming and &quot;mossing,&quot; or gathering sphagnum moss for sale to florists. Local hunters supplied New York and Philadelphia with wildfowl via the railroads. Waretown became known for its hunting and fishing grounds, and celebrities like Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, baseball great Babe Ruth, and Wild West entertainer Buffalo Bill Cody came to participate in these pursuits.

During World War II, blimps cruised along the Jersey coast looking for German U-boats. Local fishermen reported periscopes of U-boats within 20 miles of the shore. As a precaution, troops were stationed in town at the Bayview Hotel on Barnegat Bay. In 1960, the landmark structure burned to the ground, nearly 70 years after its opening in 1890.

<text>Ocean Acres is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) split between Barnegat Township and Stafford Township, in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2010 United States Census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 16,142, of which 925 were in Barnegat Township and 15,217 were in Stafford Township. Ocean Acres is located in the northwestern end of Stafford Township and part of Barnegat Township, and is the newest and biggest part of both communities, with approximately 5,500 lots in an area of .

==History==
Ocean Acres was started in the early 1960s, on a large tract west of the Garden State Parkway sprawling between Stafford Township and Barnegat Townships. Potential buyers were bused to the site and in its first year, 2,000 lots were sold. The original Ocean Acres development offered three home designs, two ranch styles and a bi-level design. The original models were located on New Jersey Route 72, west of the present site of the Southern Ocean Medical Center, all three are currently used as businesses.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, growth on the community was slow. Only a handful of the streets were paved, and most homes were used as summer homes. The community offered several recreation centers, such as a lakefront park near the Nautilus Drive entrance (it was eventually leveled to make way for an expanded lake), a second lakefront park with tennis and basketball courts off of Buccaneer Lane was created. This included a bathing beach and pool, and an 18-hole golf course. The pool has since been removed, but the bathing beach is still open to swimmers after being closed for several years throughout the 1990s. This lake also serves as a popular area for fishing and kayaking. While many original recreational centers original to Ocean Acres, many new parks and recreation centers owned by Stafford Township were built since the 1990s.

For years, a state-mandated moratorium on construction west of the Garden State Parkway had limited the 5,500-lot community to fewer than 800 homes. In the 1990s, when the moratorium was lifted and sewer lines were installed; development skyrocketed. Several area developers built nearly thousands of homes in the 1990s. Large areas of vacant land in Ocean Acres were even set aside for other individual subdivisions, such as The Oaks at Stafford development. The Ocean Acres Elementary School opened to grades K-2 in 1999.

Development in the Barnegat side of the development was restricted for years due to environmental concerns, development was jump-started in the 2000s starting with the completion of Nautilus Boulevard, which was formerly a &quot;missing link&quot;. The Walters Group became the first developer to build in the Barnegat section, an early sales promotion for the Ocean Acres Barnegat homes included a free Toyota Yaris hatchback to be included with the homes.

In 2010, the Garden State Parkway exit 67 in Barnegat was redesigned to redirect the southbound exit ramp onto the Lighthouse Drive entrance to Ocean Acres. The opening of the exit and redesign of the interchange fueled growth of the Barnegat section starting in the 2010s, with a major shopping center under construction at the intersection.

<text>Point Pleasant is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore, in northern Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 18,941, an increase of 549 (+3.0%) from the 2010 census count of 18,392, which in turn reflected a decline of 914 (−4.7%) from the 19,306 counted at 2000 census.

The borough is a Jersey Shore community situated south of the Manasquan River and north and east of the Beaverdam Creek and its confluence with the Metedeconk River.

Point Pleasant was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 21, 1920, from portions of Brick Township, based on the results of a referendum held on May 19, 1920. The borough was reincorporated on March 12, 1928. Point Pleasant is distinct from Point Pleasant Beach, which is a separate community. The borough gets its name from Point Pleasant Beach, which gets its name from its location at the northern end of the Barnegat Peninsula, a long, narrow barrier peninsula that divides the Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean at the Manasquan Inlet.

== History ==
Around 1500, the area that included the future Point Pleasant was the ceremonial meeting place of the Lenape Native Americans, who called it the &quot;Land of Tall Timber&quot;. In approximately 1665, the first European settlers arrived in the area, mainly fishermen, farmers and boat builders.

On February 15, 1850, Governor Daniel Haines and the New Jersey Legislature separated Ocean County from Monmouth County, and created Brick Township, including the Point Pleasant area, which became independent of Brick Township in 1920, though the post office carried the designation &quot;West Point Pleasant&quot; until 1956. According to the town&#x27;s official website, many longtime residents still use that name. The town&#x27;s first mayor was Melville B. Parker, chosen after J.H. Harvey declined the position after being elected. The town was initially a logging town, although logging was never a significant part of the local economy.

In 1925, the Manasquan River-Bay Head Canal was completed as part of the inland waterway. The canal, which divides Point Pleasant in half, provides a passage for boats, and is the northernmost leg of the Intracoastal Waterway which traverses the East Coast of the United States along the Atlantic Ocean between New Jersey and Florida. In 1964, Senator Clifford P. Case introduced legislation that changed the canal&#x27;s name to the Point Pleasant Canal. The two lift bridges over the canal, at Route 88 and Bridge Avenue, can be opened as many as 300 times per day during the summer to allow boats to pass underneath as marine traffic has the right of way.

Though often regarded as a summer resort, the borough&#x27;s website emphasizes that it is a &quot;year round community of approximately 19,000 residents&quot;.

The borough&#x27;s flag was designed by Carlo Kirk Polino, who created it at the age of 12 and presented it to the borough council in 2024, which adopted it unanimously.

<doc id="125641" wikidata="Q674008" url="?curid=125641" title="Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey">
<text>Point Pleasant Beach is a coastal borough situated on the Jersey Shore, and the northernmost community directly facing the Atlantic Ocean within Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It lies at the northern end of the Barnegat Peninsula, which serves as a barrier island separating Barnegat Bay from the open Atlantic Ocean. The borough&#x27;s name is derived from its location.

As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,766, an increase of 101 (+2.2%) from the 2010 census count of 4,665, which in turn reflected a decline of 649 (−12.2%) from the 5,314 counted in the 2000 census.

Point Pleasant Beach was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 18, 1886, from portions of Brick Township, subject to the results of a referendum passed the previous day. Point Pleasant Beach lies immediately to the east of Point Pleasant borough, an entirely separate municipality within Ocean County.

The borough&#x27;s boardwalk is approximately one mile long, spanning the coastline from the Manasquan Inlet at the north to New Jersey Avenue in the south. The central third of the boardwalk is largely amusement rides, the Jenkinson&#x27;s Aquarium, the Jenkinsons Arcades, pizza joints, ice cream parlors, games-of-chance and miniature golf courses. There are fees of up to $10 per person age 12 or over to access the various beaches, as well as parking fees of up to $2.50 per hour or more.

The beach was ranked eighth-best in New Jersey in the &quot;2008 Top 10 Beaches Contest&quot; sponsored by the New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium.

==History==
The area that includes Point Pleasant Beach was first occupied by the Lenape Native Americans. On September 2, 1609, Henry Hudson and the crew of his ship, &quot;Half Moon&quot;, noticed the area on their way north to explore the Hudson River. Crew member Robert Juet noted in his journal, &quot;This is a very good Land to fall with and a pleasant Land to see.&quot; The first European settlers were fisherman and farmers who first arrived in the 18th century. Summer tourism began in the early 19th century when Quaker Thomas Cook Jr. opened his farmhouse on the site of the current Antrim Elementary School to boarders, which began the trend that transformed the area into an oceanfront haven for visitors, a trend further established in the 1870 by Captain John Arnold, who built a roadway to the ocean, now known as Arnold Avenue. In 1875, he built the first bridge over the Manasquan River, linking the town to Brielle. He later convinced the Central Jersey Railroad to extend its service to Point Pleasant Beach, which it did beginning on July 3, 1880.

The Borough of Point Pleasant Beach was established on June 2, 1886.

The 1870s was an era of major tourism expansion, driven by developers who subdivided old farms for vacation home lots. Captain Arnold devised Arnold City between Central and what was to become Arnold Avenue. In 1877, the Point Pleasant Land Company bought the old Forman Farm, on what is now Route 35 South, between Forman and Elizabeth Avenues and began selling lots. In 1878, it built the four-story, 200-guest Resort House, the largest building in town. It also began a horse-drawn trolley service to attract tourists. Other hotels were built before the turn-of-the-20th century, including the largest, the Leighton, as well as the Beacon, and Zimmerman&#x27;s, though many of these, including the Resort House, burnt down, succumbed to changing tastes, or were dismantled for wood during World War II. Initially, visitors focused their attention on the Manasquan River, cedar groves and farmhouses, but their interest in the ocean led to development on the waterfront, beginning with the first beachfront pavilion on Atlantic Avenue in 1880. Ten years later, the first flimsy, portable boardwalk was built, but it washed away within two years.

The original amusement area was Clark&#x27;s Landing, which opened on the Manasquan River in 1892. In 1897, the decision for privately owned beaches in Point Pleasant Beach was made when, as noted in the Council minutes of August 16, &quot;Ownership of the Beach turned down by the Council because of the extreme cost to the Borough for maintenance.&quot; In 1915, the first permanent boardwalk was built between Philadelphia and Central Avenues, and eventually expanded along the entire length of Point Pleasant Beach, but shortened to its present length by a September 1938 hurricane that destroyed its southern portion. It evolved from a mere promenade for strolling to a more active amusement area, beginning with Charles Jenkinson&#x27;s construction in the 1920s of Jenkinson&#x27;s Pavilion and Swimming Pool. The boardwalk pavilion became the center of nightlife, featuring sophisticated dancing, well-known big bands, and occasional live nationally broadcast radio. Today it features a number of amusement rides, video arcades, and diverse cuisine, ranging from sausage sandwiches to sushi. Point Pleasant Beach hosts an annual Seafood Festival in September.

On February 12, 1900, the steel-hulled, Scottish barque, &quot;County of Edinburgh&quot; was blown ashore at high tide and became stranded. The event became national news when it was extensively reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, illustrated by a high quality photograph that became the resource for a famous painting by Antonio Jacobsen. The undamaged vessel was successfully re-floated on the spring tide of February 14 and continued on her voyage from Cape Town to New York.

In October 2012, Point Pleasant Beach and numerous other Jersey Shore communities, such as Seaside Heights and Long Beach Island, were devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Nearly of the borough&#x27;s boardwalk was destroyed, with the cost of repairs estimated as up to $2 million.

After Hurricane Sandy a seawall was constructed to protect the area from future storms. In addition, the borough required residents who wished to rebuild their homes to elevate them on pilings above the height of Sandy&#x27;s storm surge.

<text>Seaside Heights is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore, within Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 2,440, a decrease of 447 (−15.5%) from the 2010 census count of 2,887, which in turn had reflected a decline of 268 (−8.5%) from the 3,155 counted in the 2000 census. Seaside Heights is located on the Barnegat Peninsula, a long, narrow barrier peninsula that separates the Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. During the summer, the borough attracts a crowd largely under the age of 21, mainly highschoolers and young adults, drawn to a community with boardwalk entertainment and one of the few shore communities with sizable numbers of apartments, attracting as many as 65,000 people who are often out until early morning visiting bars and restaurants.

Based on the results of a referendum held on March 25, 1913, Seaside Heights was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 26, 1913, from portions of both Berkeley Township and Dover Township (now Toms River). The borough was named for its location on the Atlantic Ocean.

As a resort community, the beach, an amusement-oriented boardwalk, and numerous clubs and bars, make it a popular destination. Seaside Heights calls itself, &quot;Your Home For Family Fun Since 1913!&quot; The beach season runs from March to October, with the peak months being July and August, when the summer population explodes to as many as 30,000 to 65,000. Route 37 in Toms River is routinely gridlocked on Friday afternoons in the summer months as vacationers travel to the barrier islands. The community is also known as the location of the hit MTV show &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;, with the director of the borough&#x27;s business improvement district saying in 2010 that &quot;we can&#x27;t even calculate the economic benefit&quot; to Seaside Heights from the continued presence of the show.

==History==

In 1915, Senate Amusement Company of Philadelphia planned to build an ocean-side attraction in Seaside Heights within feet of the border to Seaside Park. Their plan was to build a covered pier to house a carousel. The structure was built in 1915 under the direction of Joseph Vanderslice of Senate Amusement Company. Budget issues stalled the project in 1916, and the amusement ride and building was subsequently sold to Frank Freeman. The combination of the completion of the Toms River Bridge on October 23, 1914, and the DuPont Avenue carousel and boardwalk are what likely led to the 159% population growth shown between the 1920 and 1930 censuses in Seaside Heights.

===Disasters===
On June 9, 1955, a malfunctioning neon sign component caused a fire at a shop on the corner of Ocean Terrace and DuPont Avenue. The fire was driven by winds estimated at , blowing the fire south and engulfing the entire pier. The fire was stopped at Stockton Avenue due in part to the fact that the boardwalk and pier ended there. In what became known as Freeman&#x27;s Fire, a total of 85 buildings were destroyed with an estimated $4 million in damage.
Beginning on October 29, 2012, substantial portions of the boardwalk were damaged and much of the borough was flooded as a result of Hurricane Sandy. Both the Funtown Pier and Casino Pier suffered devastating major damage, with sections of both piers torn apart by powerful storm surges and waves causing many of the rides to collapse into the ocean. With a curfew set at 4:00 pm to prevent looting, a New Year&#x27;s Eve party was held at the Beachcomber for hundreds of area residents at which the arrival of 2013 was celebrated at 3:00 in the afternoon. Casino Pier began cleanup attempts soon after, in an attempt to reopen in time for the summer 2013 season. The Star Jet roller coaster that fell into the water with the Casino Pier had become an attraction in itself. It was taken apart by a wrecker from Weeks Marine on May 14, 2013, just a short time after Prince Harry&#x27;s visit to the site the same day with Governor Chris Christie. Repairs to the boardwalk were completed on June 21, 2013, with New Jersey&#x27;s First Lady, Mary Pat Christie, hammering the nail into the final board of the project.

On September 12, 2013, a ten-alarm fire swept from the Funtown Pier northward. The fire is believed to have started under the boardwalk, below the Kohr&#x27;s Custard stand at the southern end of the pier. The wind pushed it northward, and fire crews were able to make a stand at Lincoln Avenue by tearing up the newly replaced boardwalk which had been destroyed less than a year before by Hurricane Sandy. Jack &amp; Bill&#x27;s Bar and Kohr&#x27;s Custard were two businesses that were both destroyed in the 1955 and 2013 fires.

<text>Seaside Park is a borough in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is part of the New Brunswick–Lakewood, NJ Metropolitan Division, which is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,436, a decrease of 143 (−9.1%) from the 2010 census count of 1,579, which in turn had reflected decline of 684 (−30.2%) from the 2,263 counted in the 2000 census. Seaside Park is situated on the Barnegat Peninsula, a long, narrow barrier peninsula that separates Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the barrier island were Lenape Native Americans who came in search of fish, crabs, clams, and scallops. They called this area &quot;Seheyichbi,&quot; meaning land bordering the ocean. The Atlantic Ocean provided more than food; these people began using shells in place of wooden beads as their form of currency. These Native Americans, who stayed during the summer and went inland for winter, were part of the principal Algonquian tribe that lived mainly on and around the North American Seaboard. The Algonquians in New Jersey called themselves &quot;Lenni Lenape&quot;, which means &quot;original people.&quot;
What is now Seaside Park was a section of Dover Township (now known as Toms River Township) until the creation of Berkeley Township in 1875. The area then became known as the Sea Side Park section of Berkeley Township. Over the next 25 years, lots were sold, houses and roads were built, and the population of Seaside Park began to grow.

On March 3, 1898, New Jersey Senate President Foster M. Voorhees, the acting governor of New Jersey, signed a bill incorporating &quot;Sea Side Park&quot; as an independent borough, created from portions of Berkeley Township. Originally, the town ran from 14th Avenue to North Avenue, about half its present size. An area known as the Berkeley Tract, north of the original area of the borough, was annexed on or about May 12, 1900. The borough was named for its location on the Atlantic Ocean.

As the community grew, the name of the borough lost a space. In 1914, a newly appointed municipal clerk wrote the name of the borough as &quot;Seaside Park&quot; in the council minutes, combining the first two words. This practice continues to this day.

While Sea Side Park was going through the process of being incorporated, the Senate Amusement Company of Philadelphia was working on plans to build an oceanside attraction in Seaside Heights within feet of the border to Sea Side Park. Their plan was to build a covered pier to house a carousel. The structure was built in 1915 under the direction of Joseph Vanderslice of Senate Amusement Company. Budget issues caused the business to not open in 1916, and the amusement ride and building was subsequently sold to Frank Freeman. The combination of the completion of the Toms River Bridge on October 23, 1914, and the DuPont Avenue carousel and boardwalk are what likely led to the 219% population growth shown between the 1910 and 1920 censuses in Sea Side Park.

===Disasters===
On June 9, 1955, a malfunctioning neon sign component caused a fire at a shop on the corner of Ocean Terrace and DuPont Avenue. The fire was driven by winds estimated at , blowing the fire south and engulfing the entire pier. The fire was stopped at Stockton Avenue due in part to the fact that the boardwalk and pier ended there. In what became known as Freeman&#x27;s Fire, a total of 85 buildings were destroyed with an estimated $4 million in damage from the conflagration.

On March 8, 1962, Seaside Park was affected by a nor&#x27;easter that had churned offshore for two days. The storm, which destroyed a large section of the borough&#x27;s boardwalk, is variously referred to as the Ash Wednesday Storm, the Five High Storm and the Great March Storm of 1962.

On September 12, 2013, a ten-alarm fire swept from the Funtown Pier northward. The fire is believed to have started under the boardwalk, below the Kohr&#x27;s Kustard stand at the southern end of the pier. The wind pushed it northward, and fire crews were able to make a stand at Lincoln Avenue by tearing up the newly replaced boardwalk which was destroyed less than a year before by Hurricane Sandy. Jack &amp; Bill&#x27;s Bar and Kohr&#x27;s Kustard were two businesses that were destroyed in both the 1955 and 2013 fires.

On September 17, 2016, a suspected pipe bomb was placed in a trashcan and detonated, causing a small explosion, but no injuries or deaths. It is currently unclear who placed the bomb and under what motivation, but it is believed the bomb&#x27;s intended target was the Seaside Semper Five, a 5K run taking place in the surrounding area. The run had been delayed due to unforeseen circumstances regardless, but was canceled soon after details of the explosion became clear.

==Education==
After the Seaside Park School District, which had served public school students in kindergarten through sixth grade, closed in 2010, a sending/receiving relationship was established with the Toms River Regional Schools for Seaside Park students in grades K–6.

In 2015, the Seaside Park district submitted a petition to the New Jersey Department of Education to allow Seaside Park to establish a second send / receive relationship with the Lavallette School District, under which Seaside Park students would have the choice of attending K–6 school in either Toms River or Lavallette. A number of students from Seaside Park had already been attending Lavallete Elementary School, including four of the five board of education members who voted in favor of the petition. The Lavallete district actively supported the proposal and the Toms River Schools had posed no objection when Seaside Park had originally submitted the petition. In 2017, the Appellate Division affirmed a decision by the commissioner of education to allow Seaside Park to establish the dual send / receive relationship with the Lavallette district, rejecting the claims made by the Toms River Schools and noting the fact that the district had posed no objection when Seaside Park had submitted a petition to advance the proposal in 2015.

Students in public school for seventh through twelfth grades attend the schools of the Central Regional School District, which also serves students from the municipalities of Berkeley Township, Island Heights, Ocean Gate and Seaside Heights. Schools in the district (with 2017–2018 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Central Regional Middle School for grades 7 and 8 (761 students) and 
Central Regional High School for grades 9–12 (1,401 students). The district&#x27;s Board of Education consists of nine members, who are directly elected by the residents of the constituent municipalities to three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three seats up for election each year. Seaside Park is allocated one of the board&#x27;s nine seats.

<text>Ship Bottom is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore, within Ocean County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,098, a decrease of 58 (−5.0%) from the 2010 census count of 1,156, which in turn had reflected a decline of 228 (−16.5%) from the 1,384 counted in the 2000 census. The borough is located on Long Beach Island and borders the Atlantic Ocean. The summer population can climb as high as 20,000.

The borough&#x27;s name was derived from a March 1817 incident in which a woman was saved from a wrecked ship that had capsized as her rescuers used axes to cut through the bottom of the hull.

What is now Ship Bottom was originally incorporated as the borough of Ship Bottom-Beach Arlington by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 3, 1925, from portions of Long Beach Township, based on the results of a referendum held on May 23, 1925. The borough name was shortened to Ship Bottom in 1947.

The borough is known as the &quot;Gateway to Long Beach Island&quot;, as Route 72 provides the sole road access from Manahawkin in Stafford Township, ending in Ship Bottom as it crosses Manahawkin Bay via the Manahawkin Bay Bridge (formally known as the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.99 square miles (2.58 km2), including 0.71 square miles (1.84 km2) of land and 0.28 square miles (0.73 km2) of water (28.48%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Beach Arlington.

The borough borders the Ocean County municipalities of Long Beach Township, Stafford Township, and Surf City.

<text>Stafford Township is a township situated on the Jersey Shore in southern Ocean County, within the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 28,617, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 2,082 (+7.8%) from the 26,535 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,003 (+17.8%) from the 22,532 counted in the 2000 census.

Stafford Township is the gateway to the resort communities on Long Beach Island, with Route 72 providing the sole road access to the island, ending in Ship Bottom as it crosses Barnegat Bay via the Manahawkin Bay Bridge (formally known as the Dorland J. Henderson Memorial Bridge). The Garden State Parkway and U.S. Route 9 pass through the township and provide access to Route 72.

==History==
Stafford Township was formed by royal charter on March 3, 1750, from portions of Shrewsbury Township, while the area was still part of Monmouth County. It was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s first 104 townships by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, and became part of the newly formed Ocean County on February 15, 1850. Portions of the township were taken to form Union Township (March 10, 1846, now Barnegat Township), Eagleswood Township (March 17, 1874), Long Beach City Borough (September 19, 1894, now Surf City) and Long Beach Township (March 23, 1899). The township was named after Staffordshire, England.

Historically, Stafford Township was a rural area, with the notable exception of the downtown hub of Manahawkin. Significant growth began in the 1950s with the development of resort communities like Beach Haven West and Ocean Acres. These developments coincided with the completion of the Garden State Parkway and the expansion of Route 72, which formerly ran along the two-lane Bay Avenue.

While growing quickly, development was still sparse. Route 72 was still mostly wooded, aside from several car dealerships, gas stations, a drive-in movie theater, and the Manahawkin Executive Airport. The pace of development increased during the 1980s with new residential projects, including the expansion of Beach Haven West and Ocean Acres, transforming the area from seasonal vacation homes to year-round residences. This period also saw the establishment of Stafford Square, the township&#x27;s first major shopping center. The Manahawkin Airport closed in the early 1990s to make way for commercial developments, including a Walmart and Pathmark. However, part of the runway was left intact until the 2000s, when the St. Mary&#x27;s of the Pines Catholic Church and All Saints Regional Catholic School were built on the land.

Stafford Township celebrates its history and community spirit through an annual Founders Day event held each June. Originating in 1964 as part of New Jersey’s 300th anniversary celebrations, Founders Day has grown into a vibrant tradition featuring a hometown parade, pie-eating contests, inflatable rides, the Miss Stafford, Jr. Miss Stafford, Little Miss Stafford, and Little Town Crier pageants, and concludes with a fireworks display.

In July 2021, the township buried a 50-year time capsule, which will be opened in 2070. Stafford Township officials included various items, and residents submitted memorabilia from 2020 to give future residents a glimpse of life in Stafford Township during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Surf City is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore in southern Ocean County, within the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,243, an increase of 38 (+3.2%) from the 2010 census count of 1,205, which in turn had reflected a decline of 237 (−16.4%) from the 1,442 counted in the 2000 census. The borough borders the Atlantic Ocean on Long Beach Island.

What is now Surf City was originally formed as Long Beach City borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 19, 1894, from portions of Stafford Township, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day. The borough was renamed Surf City by a resolution of the Borough Council as of May 26, 1899. The name was changed to avoid confusion with other places on the island and along the Jersey Shore.

==History==
Present-day Surf City was home to one of the earliest big boarding hotels on the Jersey Shore, called the Mansion of Health, one of whose owners was Hudson Buzby. In the 1830s and 1840s, the area surrounding this hotel was called &quot;Buzby&#x27;s Place&quot;. The Mansion of Health burned down in 1874, but some old-timers still call the cove at the foot of South First Street on the bay side &quot;Mansion Cove.&quot;

In 1875, the 20 or so permanent residents of the area decided to call the area Long Beach City, even though the area was still part of Stafford Township. In 1894, Surf City was incorporated, changing its name to Surf City in 1899 after the United States Postal Service required a name change before the town could incorporate, preventing it from being confused with Long Branch in Monmouth County.

<text>Tuckerton is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore, within Ocean County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 3,577, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 230 (+6.9%) from the 3,347 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn had reflected a decline of 170 (−4.8%) from the 3,517 counted in the 2000 census.

Tuckerton was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 18, 1901, from portions of Little Egg Harbor Township.

The borough is surrounded by Little Egg Harbor Township, but is politically independent. Because Tuckerton and Little Egg Harbor share the same 08087 ZIP code and Little Egg Harbor has no true &quot;downtown&quot; area, many refer to Little Egg Harbor and surrounding suburbs as &quot;Tuckerton&quot;.

Tuckerton is home to the Tuckerton Seaport, a working maritime museum and village.

==History==

The area that is now Tuckerton was settled in 1698. Some of the early settlers were Andrews, Falkinburgs, Shourds, Ongs, Willets and Osborns. Edward Andrews, settled on the east side of Pohatcong Creek; his brother, Mordecai Andrews settled on the west side of the same creek. Edward, tired of going to Mount Holly Township with his grain, constructed a cedar log grist mill on the site of a dam built by beavers at the mouth of what is known as Tuckerton Creek. He built the grist mill in 1704, and it still stands to this day.

Tuckerton became a Port of Entry of the United States, but not the third port as is commonly believed. The community was named for founder Ebenezer Tucker (1758–1845), who was appointed Collector, his commission bearing the date March 21, 1791, signed by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Six years later, Tuckerton became a post-town with Reuben Tucker as its first postmaster.

Former names of the town included &quot;Andrew Mills&quot;, &quot;Middle-of-the-Shore&quot;, &quot;Clamtown&quot;, &quot;Quakertown&quot;, and &quot;Fishtown&quot;. In March 1789, Ebenezer Tucker hosted a feast at the then-named Clamtown for the residents, at which time they officially changed the name to Tuckerton.

In 1816, Isaac Jenkins established the first stage line between Tuckerton and Philadelphia, making one trip a week, each trip taking two days to travel each way. John D. Thompson bought the line in 1828 and ran the stages each way in a day and carried the mail. The stages and vessels were the only public conveyances to the cities until the Tuckerton Railroad was built in 1871.
What was probably New Jersey&#x27;s first summer resort was on Tucker&#x27;s Island offshore from Little Egg Harbor. The island sported boarding houses, private cottages, and a school. In 1848 a Lighthouse was erected there, with Eben Rider as its first lightkeeper. In 1869 the Little Egg Harbor Lifesaving&#x27;s Station was constructed there. Also known as Sea Haven, the island contained two hotels. The island was wiped away in a storm, including its lighthouse, which fell into the sea. At the Tuckerton Seaport Museum, a re-created lighthouse has been built as well as other re-created buildings that were on Tuckers Island. In the lighthouse, there are several wall-mounted pictures showing the instant that the original lighthouse fell into the sea. The original island remains underwater.

The area surrounding present-day Tuckerton was part of Burlington County until 1891 when it joined with Ocean County. Tuckerton was established in March 1901, with its first mayor being Frank R. Austin.

By the turn of the 1800s, Tuckerton was home to a robust downtown area of shops, boarding houses, and hotels. Around 1800, Ebenezer Tucker built the &quot;Union House&quot; on the corner of Main Street &amp; Green Street, which served as a post office, stagecoach stop, and lodge. The Union House was later known as the &quot;Carlton House&quot;, which operated as an inn and tavern until it was destroyed by fire in 1964. The &quot;Everett House&quot; was built in the 1870s as a first-class temperance hotel to serve railroad passengers; the building, on Main Street between Green Street and Water Street, was demolished by the mid-20th Century. The Lakeside Hotel, situated on Main Street next to Lake Pohatcong, operated well into the 20th Century before its closure and demolition; a plaque commemorating World War I veterans on the side of the building was moved to its current site in Greenwood Cemetery.

The Tuckerton Methodist Episcopal Church was originally established in 1797. In 1868, the congregation broke ground on an elaborate Colonial-style church building featuring a slate-covered steeple, forged stained glass windows, a town clock, bell, and pipe organ. The building was constructed by shipwrights, as the boro was a bustling shipping and fishing village at the time.

In 1921, Reuben Gerber opened Gerber&#x27;s Department Store on Main Street. The store&#x27;s art deco interior was modeled after the Macy&#x27;s Herald Square flagship store in New York City. Gerber&#x27;s served as Tuckerton&#x27;s main general store and was an authorized dealership for early Ford vehicles. The building remains and is currently known as the &quot;Tuckerton Emporium&quot;, which houses a consortium of local vendors.
On May 7, 1979, a large wind-driven fire destroyed the century-old Tuckerton United Methodist Church, two stores, and several homes on Main Street, leaving 23 people homeless. The conflagration started in the Tuckerton Variety Store on 25 W. Main Street and spread to a vacant storefront and two second-floor apartments next door; 20-mph sea breeze winds carried embers 200 yards to the church, which quickly burned out of control. The embers also ignited fires in five homes on N. Green Street and several brush fires, all of which were quickly extinguished. Eighteen fire departments from Ocean and Burlington counties responded to the blaze.

<doc id="125654" wikidata="Q885389" url="?curid=125654" title="Bloomingdale, New Jersey">
<text>Bloomingdale is a borough in Passaic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,777, an increase of 121 (+1.6%) from the 2010 census count of 7,656, which in turn reflected an increase of 46 (+0.6%) from the 7,610 counted in the 2000 census.

Bloomingdale is home to four membership lake communities including Glen Wild Lake, Lake Iosco, Kampfe Lake, and Morse Lakes; a suburban neighborhood featuring an upper and lower lake.

==History==
Bloomingdale&#x27;s Federal Hill was the site of the 1781 Pompton Mutiny, a winter revolt of Continental Army troops that was crushed by General Robert Howe on direct orders of General George Washington.

Growth in Bloomingdale was driven by the development in the late 1860s of a rubber mill and other factories in neighboring Butler. The New Jersey Midland Railroad, later known as the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway, laid tracks adjacent to the settlement, with a Bloomingdale station located in what today is Riverdale. The northern section of Riverdale and most of Butler were known as East Bloomingdale and West Bloomingdale respectively during most of the 19th century. Despite crossing a county border, they also shared a school district and residents considered the whole area as &quot;Bloomingdale&quot; until about 1881 when a Post Office named Butler was designated. This began a period of rivalry which caused a schism between the residents of Butler and Bloomingdale resulting in separate schools, churches and even town bands.

Bloomingdale was incorporated as an independent borough on February 23, 1918, when Pompton Township was split up into three new municipalities along with Wanaque and Ringwood. Prior to that, the area was known as Bloomingdale throughout the 19th century and was initially a farming community starting about 1712 with the &quot;Bloomingdale Forge&quot; built shortly thereafter to take advantage of the iron in the hills. The business district along the Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike and the Pequannock River began about the middle of the 19th century.

Bloomingdale, like most municipalities in northeastern North Jersey, is a suburb of New York City. Some of the things that still link Bloomingdale to its past are its two churches (Methodist and Baptist), the Samuel R. Donald School (originally built in 1886) and the Bloomingdale Cornet Band continuously active since 1884.

DeLazier Field, used by the Triboro Little League, was the home field for the Minor League Baseball team known as the Bloomingdale Troopers of the North Atlantic League from 1946 to 1948.

The History of Bloomingdale can be found in three separate books published by the borough in 1958, 1968 and 1993. Additionally, more history can be found in microfilmed local newspapers located at the Butler Museum, the Morristown Library, the Paterson Library and the New Jersey State Archives.

<doc id="125655" wikidata="Q254428" url="?curid=125655" title="Clifton, New Jersey">
<text>Clifton is a city in Passaic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Criss-crossed by several major highways, the city is a regional commercial hub for North Jersey and is a bedroom suburb of New York City in the New York Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 United States Census, the city retained its position as the state&#x27;s 11th-most-populous municipality, just behind tenth-ranked Trenton, and well ahead of Cherry Hill in twelfth place, with a population of 90,296, reflecting an overall increase of 6,160 (+7.3%) from the 2010 census count of 84,136, which in turn reflected an overall increase of 5,464 (+6.9%) from the 78,672 counted in the 2000 census. The Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 88,461 for 2023, making Clifton the 394th-most populous municipality in the nation.

Clifton was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 26, 1917, replacing Acquackanonk Township, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier. Clifton is listed under five different ZIP codes. 07011, 07012, 07013, 07014, and 07015. Clifton has been named as one of the best cities to live in the United States.

==History==
The city of Clifton turned 100 years old in April 2017, but documented European settlements in the area date back to 1679, when a leader of the Lenape Native Americans gave a deed for along the shores of the Passaic River to Hans Frederick. The modern name of &quot;Clifton&quot; was derived from the cliffs of Garrett Mountain, which borders the Albion Place neighborhood in the western part of the city. Clifton was once an agricultural hub, and home to the U.S. Animal Quarantine Station, which was operated in Clifton by the United States Department of Agriculture, starting in 1903. It was served by the Newark Branch of the Erie–Lackawanna Railroad. It was the primary location on the East Coast where animals from poultry, horses, and cattle, to zoo animals, were held in quarantine after being brought into the United States, to ensure that the animals were not infected with diseases that could be spread in the U.S. The federal station operated in Clifton until the late 1970s, when the facility was relocated to Stewart International Airport.

Although Clifton has long converted from farmlands to suburban neighborhoods, given its close proximity to Manhattan, the city still has three small working farms that sell fresh and organic vegetables in-season:

* Ploch&#x27;s Farm is a family-run farm since 1867. The farm is still in operation as Clifton&#x27;s last remaining farm. Ploch&#x27;s Farm is open seasonally selling fruits and vegetables during the months of August and September.
* City Green Farm Eco Center is an organic farm and 501(c)3 non-profit focused on promoting urban farming and education since 2011. The property, which was the site of the Schultheis Farm, was acquired by the city in 2005 for permanent preservation as open space.
* Richfield Farms is a family-run farm and garden center since 1917, which had escaped redevelopment efforts in 2018.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 11.43 square miles (29.60 km2), including 11.27 square miles (29.19 km2) of land and 0.16 square miles (0.41 km2) of water (1.37%).

The Passaic River provides part of the boundary of Clifton at its northeastern edge. Weasel Brook is a tributary of the Passaic, which links from Plog Brook, passing through its namesake Weasel Brook Park, before turning south and joining the Passaic River close to Route 21.

Unincorporated communities, localities, and place names, located partially or completely within the city, include:
* Albion Place – mostly residential, and adjacent to Garret Mountain Reservation in the northwestern corner of the city;
* Allwood – the other main &quot;business district&quot; in the city, along its main highway, State Route 3;
* Athenia – one of the more centrally located neighborhoods in the city, as well as home to one of the city&#x27;s two train stations, and adjacent to the 3rd Ward Park neighborhood in Passaic;
* Botany Village – the northernmost neighborhood in the city, historically containing European ethnic groups, but mostly populated by Hispanic/Latino immigrants in recent years;
* Delawanna – home to one of the two train stations locally, in the southeastern corner of the city, and adjacent to Nutley/the 3rd Ward Park neighborhood in Passaic;
* Dutch Hill – mostly residential, and largely situated near downtown and one of the two local train stations;
* Lakeview – shares its name with the adjacent neighborhood in Paterson, along the western edge of the city, and mostly populated by Arabic and Hispanic/Latino residents;
* Main Mall – largely considered the main &quot;downtown&quot; section of the city;
* Montclair Heights – one of the wealthiest neighborhoods locally, adjacent to both Montclair State University, as well as Upper Montclair, in the southwestern corner of the city;
* Richfield – another of the more centrally located neighborhoods in the city, along with Athenia;
* Rosemawr – largely residential and wealthier, falling partially within Allwood, and home to an Orthodox Jewish community associated with a neighboring one in the city of Passaic, with which it shares the Passaic/Clifton Eruv
* Styertowne – home to the main namesake shopping plaza in the city;
* Yanticaw Pond – adjacent to the neighboring municipalities of Bloomfield, Nutley, and Montclair

Clifton is located off both Route 3 and Route 46, and is situated west of Midtown Manhattan, which is accessible via the Lincoln Tunnel. The city is also served by the Garden State Parkway, Route 19 and Route 21; all of those highways pass either around or through parts of the city.

The city borders the municipalities of Little Falls, Passaic, Paterson, and Woodland Park in Passaic County; Elmwood Park, Garfield, Lyndhurst, and Rutherford in Bergen County, and Bloomfield, Montclair, and Nutley in Essex County.

==Government==

===Local government===
The city of Clifton is governed under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law. The city is one of seven municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. The governing body is the City Council, which is comprised of seven council members, with all positions elected at-large on a non-partisan basis to concurrent four-terms of office as part of the November general election. The mayor is chosen by the City Council, with the position traditionally given to the top vote getter in the previous election. Clifton&#x27;s municipal elections had been held in May, as required for municipalities conducting non-partisan elections. Following the passage of a state law in 2010 allowing non-partisan elections to be shifted to November, Clifton voters were overwhelmingly in favor of the move in a non-binding referendum held in November 2013. On December 13, 2013, the Clifton City Council voted 6–0, with one abstention, to make the move to November local elections binding, which had the effect of extending the terms of all sitting council members by six months, from June 30 to December 31. Officials cited increased voter participation and reduced costs as the justifications behind supporting the shift.

As of 2023, Clifton&#x27;s mayor is Raymond Grabowski, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. He replaced James Anzaldi, who had been one of the members of the City Council since 1978, and was first selected to be mayor in 1990, succeeding two-term mayor Gloria Kolodziej. Anzaldi was the first mayor in Clifton&#x27;s history to be elected to six terms. The other current members of the City Council are Chris D&#x27;Amato, William &quot;Bill&quot; Gibson, Antonio Latona, Joseph Kolodziej, Rosemary Pino, Mary Sadrakula, all of whom are serving concurrent terms of office that end on December 31, 2026.

Grabowski&#x27;s election and Council nomination as mayor ended up being considered the most contentious local political event since 1966, when the then-top vote getter, Bill Bate, the only Democrat on the Council at that time, ended up getting passed over in favor of Joseph Vanecek, as, this time around, Grabowski would only get four of the seven possible votes on the Council, as opposed to Anzaldi, who won most, if not all, of those votes unanimously, in each of his terms, with the other three votes going to newcomer Antonio Latona (Grabowski/Kolodziej/Murphy/Sadrakula voting for Grabowski; Gibson/Latona/Pino, surprisingly, voting for Latona, all despite Gibson reportedly privately considering taking enough of those votes away from Grabowski to become mayor himself as of January 2023, even though Grabowski won at the polls in November 2022 by the final margin of roughly 9,400–8,200).

===Vacancies===
If at any time a seat becomes vacant on the council, it is filled by special election unless the vacancy occurs during a council election year. If the vacancy comes before a council election year, the council must decide whether or not to appoint someone to serve as an interim councilperson within thirty days of the creation of the vacancy; if they choose to appoint someone, that person serves until the special election can be held and is eligible to run for the remainder of the term if he/she so desires. The appointee will usually be the first runner up in the previous 
council election. 

The city has done this five times since 1990:

*In 1992, Councilman George Bayeux died in office. His seat was left vacant and in the special election held in November 1992, Richard Stockinger was elected to take his place.
*In March of 1996, a vacancy was created when Stockinger, who had been elected to a full term when the council stood for election in 1994, died from lung cancer. His seat remained vacant, and the special election to fill his seat was held in November 1996 and won by Edward Welsh.
*After the newly elected council had been sworn in in 2006, Antonio Latona was forced to vacate his seat as it was determined that, as a city employee (at the time, Latona was a working member of the city fire department), serving on the council would be a conflict of interest. Matt Ward, who had finished eighth in the election, was appointed to fill the vacancy in November of that year. The city held a special election in November 2007 to fill the remainder of the term; Ward defeated three other candidates to win.
*In February 2015, just after he was sworn into office for his second term, Councilman Matt Grabowski died from cancer. The council appointed Joseph Cupoli, the highest vote-getter among the previous losing candidates, to fill the seat until the November election. Raymond Grabowski, the councilman&#x27;s brother, won the special election to serve out the remainder of the term.
*On January 13, 2024, Councilwoman Lauren Murphy died after a battle with pancreatic cancer. The council chose Chris D’Amato, who finished eighth in the previous council election, to fill the vacancy on February 3; D&#x27;Amato won the special election to fill the remainder of the term in November 2024.

===Federal, state and county representation===
Clifton is located in the 9th Congressional District, and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s 27th state legislative district.

As of the state legislative elections in November 2023, Clifton will be part of the 27th Legislative District, with both Clifton and Montclair leaving the 34th, and joining Livingston, Millburn, Roseland, and West Orange in Essex County, in that Legislative District; that reapportionment decision represented compromise between state legislators in both parties - the initial Democratic plan would have kept the existing 34th District entirely intact, while the initial Republican plan would have added it to the 40th Legislative District, placing it with some of the longtime Republican-leaning municipalities in that district.

<doc id="125656" wikidata="Q1083356" url="?curid=125656" title="Haledon, New Jersey">
<text>Haledon ( ) is a borough in Passaic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 9,052, an increase of 734 (+8.8%) from the 2010 census count of 8,318, which in turn reflected an increase of 66 (+0.8%) from the 8,252 counted in the 2000 census.

Haledon was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1908, replacing the now-defunct Manchester Township, based on the results of a referendum held on May 21, 1908.

==History==
Haledon developed along the northern side of the industrial city of Paterson. It was settled by farmers with colonial Dutch heritage including the Van Riper, Berdan, Banta, Post and Zabriskie families. Prior to the Civil War they were joined by the Roe, Leonhard and Stansfield families, who helped establish St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church and leading businesses including a general store and the Leonhard Wax Company.

The area became a streetcar suburb of Paterson in the years following the Civil War, with the central area known as Haledon, while the area surrounding the large pond along High Mountain Road was called Oldham. The Paterson and Haledon Horse Rail Road Company, formed in 1871, laid trolley tracks from Paterson along the current-day Belmont Avenue, which were electrified by 1888.

Many of the trolley company&#x27;s owners were among the founders of the Cedar Cliff Land Company, which bought up large portions of the area, and the street names in the borough reflect these industrialists and businessmen: Morrissee, Hoxey, Van Dyke, John Ryle and Barbour.

The flat, lower part of the community was laid out in city-sized lots of , while the hillsides were plated as sites for larger Victorian &quot;villas&quot; for such individuals as Vice President Garret A. Hobart (now the location of William Paterson University) and the Barbour family of linen flax manufacturers. Haledon&#x27;s villa development was rather limited and throughout much of the 20th century Haledon was a typical blue-collar community set by the small property sizes planned by the Cedar Cliff Land Company.

A never-constructed grand hotel was planned for the highest point of the community above the intersection of the current day Central and West Haledon Avenues. The Cedar Cliff Land Company ran newspaper advertisements targeted at upwardly mobile immigrants who worked in Paterson&#x27;s silk industry, offering the city-sized lots for sale at auctions (with free lunches and brass bands) held at St. Mary&#x27;s Parish Hall, and also opened the Cedar Cliff Silk Mill, which became one of several silk mills in the community.

The residential appeal of Haledon was to escape the crowded industrial city and still have access to the textile mills by using the trolley. As a result of the land sales of Cedar Cliff Land Company and of independent landowner William Buschmann, the town was settled by immigrants who came as skilled workers from textile centers in Europe.

Paramount Dining Car Company was based in Haledon, and built many of New Jersey&#x27;s iconic stainless steel modular diners, including White Manna in Hackensack and Rosie&#x27;s Diner that was once on Route 46 in Little Ferry.

Haledon was incorporated in 1908, having been the Oldham district of the former Passaic County municipality of Manchester Township.

Socialist William Bruekmann was elected mayor in 1912 by the borough&#x27;s immigrant resident base of skilled silk workers. During the 1913 Paterson silk strike, Haledon&#x27;s mayor offered the strikers the opportunity to hold meetings in Haledon, as worker meetings were prohibited in Paterson. The Pietro and Maria Botto House, located on the side of a hill surrounded by open spaces, provided a natural amphitheater for labor leaders of the day to address thousands of people who gathered to hear Big Bill Haywood, Carlo Tresca, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and John Reed. The Botto House is now a National Historic Landmark and the home of the American Labor Museum.

In 2008, Councilman Alan Souto, at the time an officer with the Passaic County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, was arrested for stealing heroin and cocaine from the evidence room from the sheriff&#x27;s department in order to distribute narcotics, amounting to over $250,000. After being found guilty, he was sentenced to 85 months in federal prison in May 2009. Souto was replaced in April 2008 by Marc Battle, a commercial litigator and former civil rights attorney.

The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the seven-member borough council. A Charter Study Commission, formed in the 1980s after two major commercial businesses left the borough, led to a recommendation for the adoption of a mayor–council form in which there are four wards to give residents a representative in each area of the community, in addition to a mayor and two at-large members of the borough council, all of whom are directly elected by residents, with all members of the governing body serving four-year terms of office. After residents approved the commission&#x27;s recommendations, the first election under the mayor–council form was held in 1989.

Matthews (R, Ward 4, 2023), Dominic Mele (R, at-large, 2025), Ann Marie Sasso (R, at-large, 2025), Michael Sciarra (R, Ward 3, 2023; elected to serve an unexpired term) and Joseph R. Wojtecki (D, Ward 1, 2023).

Sinning, who died two weeks after winning re-election; Sciarra served on an interim basis until the November 2020 general election, when voters chose him to serve the balance of the term of office.

Little Falls traces its first European settlement to 1711, when seven Bergen Dutch settlers banded together to begin farming. The Speer Homestead dates from (and may have originally been built in 1680).

The Morris Canal, once an important artery of trade and transportation until 1925 between the Delaware and Hudson rivers, wound its way through the township, and vestiges of it still remain today, some parts of which form a greenway.

Little Falls was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 2, 1868, from portions of Acquackanonk Township. On March 25, 1914, portions of the township were taken to form the borough of West Paterson (now Woodland Park).

Singac (with a 2010 Census population of 3,618) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Little Falls Township.

The township has three main sub-divisions. Great Notch is the easternmost part of Little Falls. The downtown area is frequently referred to as &quot;The Center of Town&quot;, mainly by longtime residents, and is usually referred to as simply Little Falls. Singac is in the westernmost portion of the township. Much of Singac borders the Passaic River.

Effective January 1, 2005, the form of government in Little Falls was changed (based on the results of a public referendum passed in November 2003) to the Mayor-Council form authorized by the Faulkner Act. The township is one of 71 (of the 564) municipalities statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the five-member Township Council. Voters directly elect the mayor and the five township council members to four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either three seats or two seats (together with the mayoral seat) up for election in even-numbered years as part of the November general election. For most of its history, until 2003, Little Falls had been governed under the Township form of government by a township committee consisting of five committee members elected by the voters. Under this system, a chairman (mayor) and deputy-chair (deputy mayor) were selected annually by the Township Committee members.

, the mayor of Little Falls is Democrat James Belford Damiano, whose term of office ends December 31, 2024. Members of the Township Council are Council President Anthony Sgobba (D, 2024), Christine Hablitz (D, 2024), Michael Murphy (R, 2026), Jayna Patel (R, 2026) and Christopher Vancheri (D, 2026).

In the November 2017 general election, Vancheri was elected to serve the balance of Damiano’s term of office and Democrat Tanya Seber defeated Benitez for Maceri’s unexpired seat. When Seber was sworn into office, it marked the first time in township history that all of the township&#x27;s elected officials were Democrats.

<text>Phonograph cylinders (also referred to as Edison cylinders after its creator Thomas Edison) are the earliest commercial medium for recording and reproducing sound. Commonly known simply as &quot;records&quot; in their heyday (c. 1896–1916), a name which has been passed on to their disc-shaped successor, these hollow cylindrical objects have an audio recording engraved on the outside surface which can be reproduced when they are played on a mechanical cylinder phonograph. The first cylinders were wrapped with tin foil but the improved version made of wax was created a decade later, after which they were commercialized. In the 1910s, the competing disc record system triumphed in the marketplace to become the dominant commercial audio medium.

==Early development==
In December 1877, Thomas Edison and his team invented the phonograph using a thin sheet of tin foil wrapped around a hand-cranked, grooved metal cylinder. Tin foil was not a practical recording medium for either commercial or artistic purposes, and the crude hand-cranked phonograph was only marketed as a novelty, to little or no profit. Edison moved on to developing a practical incandescent electric light, and the next improvements to sound recording technology were made by others.

Following seven years of research and experimentation at their Volta Laboratory, Charles Sumner Tainter, Alexander Graham Bell, and Chichester Bell introduced wax as the recording medium, and engraving, rather than indenting, as the recording method. In 1887, their &quot;Graphophone&quot; system was being put to the test of practical use by official reporters of the US Congress, with commercial units later being produced by the Dictaphone Corporation. After this system was demonstrated to Edison&#x27;s representatives, Edison quickly resumed work on the phonograph. He settled on a thicker all-wax cylinder, the surface of which could be repeatedly shaved down for reuse. Both the Graphophone and Edison&#x27;s &quot;Perfected Phonograph&quot; were commercialized in 1888. Eventually, a patent-sharing agreement was signed, and the wax-coated cardboard tubes were abandoned in favor of Edison&#x27;s all-wax cylinders as an interchangeable standard format.
Beginning in 1889, prerecorded wax cylinders were marketed. These have professionally made recordings of songs, instrumental music or humorous monologues in their grooves. At first, the only customers for them were proprietors of nickelodeons—the first jukeboxes—installed in arcades and taverns, but within a few years, private owners of phonographs were increasingly buying them for home use. Unlike later, shorter-playing high-speed cylinders, early cylinder recordings were usually cut at a speed of about 120 rpm and can play for as long as three minutes. They were made of a relatively soft wax formulation and would wear out after they were played a few dozen times. The buyer could then use a mechanism which left their surfaces shaved smooth so new recordings could be made on them.

Cylinder machines of the late 1880s and the 1890s were usually sold with recording attachments. The ability to record as well as play back sound was an advantage of cylinder phonographs over the competition from cheaper disc record phonographs, which began to be mass-marketed at the end of the 1890s, as the disc system machines could be used only to play back prerecorded sound.

In the earliest stages of phonograph manufacturing, various incompatible, competing types of cylinder recordings were made. A standard system was decided upon by Edison Records, Columbia Phonograph, and other companies in the late 1880s. The standard cylinders are about long, in diameter, and play about two minutes of recorded material.

Originally, all cylinders sold needed to be recorded live on the softer brown wax, which wore out after as few as 20 plays. Later cylinders were reproduced either mechanically or by linking phonographs together with rubber tubes.

Over the years, the type of wax used in cylinders was improved and hardened, so that cylinders could be played with good quality over 100 times. In 1902, Edison Records launched a line of improved, hard wax cylinders marketed as &quot;Edison Gold Moulded Records&quot;. The major development of this line of cylinders is that Edison had developed a process that allowed a mold to be made from a master cylinder, which then permitted the production of several hundred cylinders to be made from the mold. The process was labeled &quot;Gold Moulded&quot; because of the gold vapor that was given off by gold electrodes used in the process.

==Commercial packaging==

The earliest soft wax cylinders were sold wrapped in thick cotton batting. Later, molded hard-wax cylinders were sold in boxes with a cotton lining. Celluloid cylinders were sold in unlined boxes. These protective boxes were normally kept and used to house the cylinders after purchase. Their general appearance allowed bandleader John Philip Sousa to deride their contents as &quot;canned music&quot;, an epithet he borrowed from Mark Twain.

==Hard plastic cylinders==
On March 20, 1900, Thomas B. Lambert was granted a US patent (645,920) that described a process for mass-producing cylinders made from celluloid, an early hard plastic. ( of France was producing celluloid cylinders as early as 1893, but they were individually recorded rather than molded.) That same year, the Lambert Company of Chicago began selling cylinder records made of the material. They would not break if dropped and could be played thousands of times without wearing out. The color was changed to black in 1903, but brown and blue cylinders were also produced. The coloring was purportedly because the dyes reduced surface noise. Unlike wax, the hard, inflexible material could not be shaved and recorded over, but it had the advantage of being nearly permanent. A 1905 Edison Phonograph may be seen and heard playing a celluloid cylinder at the Musical Museum, Brentford, England and the quality of the sound is surprisingly good.

This superior technology was licensed by the Indestructible Record Company in 1906 and Columbia Phonograph Company in 1908. The Edison Bell company in Europe had separately licensed the technology and were able to market Edison&#x27;s titles in both wax (popular series) and celluloid (indestructible series).

In late 1908, Edison had introduced wax cylinders that played for nominally four minutes (instead of the usual two) under the &quot;Amberol&quot; brand. They were made from a harder (and more fragile) form of wax to withstand the smaller stylus used to play them. The longer playing time was achieved by reducing the groove size and placing them half as far apart. In 1912, the Edison company eventually acquired Lambert&#x27;s patents to the celluloid technology, and almost immediately started production under a variation of their existing &quot;Amberol&quot; brand as &quot;Edison Blue Amberol Records&quot;.

Edison designed several phonograph types, both with internal and external horns for playing these improved cylinder records. The internal horn models were called &quot;Amberolas&quot;. Edison marketed its &quot;Fireside&quot; model phonograph with a gearshift and a &#x27;model K&#x27; reproducer with two different styli, which allowed it to play both two-minute and four-minute cylinders.

==Decline==
Cylinder records continued to compete with the growing disc record market into the 1910s, when discs won the commercial battle. In 1912, Columbia Records, which had been selling both discs and cylinders, dropped the cylinder format, while Edison introduced his Diamond Disc format, played with a diamond stylus. Beginning in 1915, new Edison cylinder issues consisted of acoustic dubbings from Edison disc masters; they therefore had lower audio quality than the disc originals. Although his cylinders continued to be sold in steadily dwindling and eventually minuscule quantities, Edison continued to support the owners of cylinder phonographs by making new titles available in that format until the company ceased manufacturing all records and phonographs in November 1929. Many of the later issued Blue Amberols were dubbed electrically from electrical recorded masters 

==Later applications==
Cylinder phonograph technology continued to be used for Dictaphone and Ediphone recordings for office use for decades.

In 1947, Dictaphone replaced wax cylinders with their Dictabelt technology, which cut a mechanical groove into a plastic belt instead of into a wax cylinder. This was later replaced by magnetic tape recording. However, cylinders for older style dictating machines continued to be available for some years, and it was not unusual to encounter cylinder dictating machines into the 1950s.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, new recordings have been made on cylinders for the novelty effect of using obsolete technology. Probably the most famous of these are by They Might Be Giants, who in 1996 recorded &quot;I Can Hear You&quot; and three other songs, performed without electricity, on an 1898 Edison wax recording studio phonograph at the Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, New Jersey. This song was released on &quot;Factory Showroom&quot; in 1996 and re-released on the 2002 compilation &quot;Dial-A-Song: 20 Years of They Might Be Giants&quot;. The other songs recorded were &quot;James K. Polk&quot;, &quot;Maybe I Know&quot;, and &quot;The Edison Museum&quot;, the last a song about the site of the recording. These recordings were officially released online as MP3 files in 2001.

Small numbers of cylinders have been manufactured in the 21st century out of modern long-lasting materials. Two companies engaged in such enterprise are the Vulcan Cylinder Record Company of Sheffield, England, and the Wizard Cylinder Records Company in Baldwin, New York.

In 2010 the British musical group The Men That Will Not Be Blamed for Nothing released the track &quot;Sewer&quot;, from their debut album, &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Steampunk! Volume 1&quot; on a wax cylinder in a limited edition of 40, of which only 30 were put on sale. The box set came with instructions on how to make a cylinder player for less than £20. The BBC covered the release on Television on BBC Click, on BBC Online, and on Radio 5 Live.

In June 2017 the Cthulhu Breakfast Club podcast released a special limited wax cylinder edition of a show.

In April 2019, the podcast &quot;Hello Internet&quot; released ten limited edition wax cylinder recordings.

In May 2023, Needlejuice Records released wax cylinder singles for Lemon Demon songs &quot;Touch-Tone Telephone&quot; and &quot;The Oldest Man On MySpace&quot;, from albums &quot;Spirit Phone&quot; and &quot;Dinosaurchestra&quot;, respectively.

==Preservation of cylinder recordings==
Because of the nature of the recording medium, playback of many cylinders can cause degradation of the recording. The replay of cylinders diminishes their fidelity and degrades their recorded signals. Additionally, when exposed to humidity, mold can penetrate a cylinder&#x27;s surface and cause the recording to have surface noise. Currently, the only professional machines manufactured for the playback of cylinder recordings are the Archéophone player, designed by Henri Chamoux and the &quot;Endpoint Cylinder and Dictabelt Machine&quot; by Nicholas Bergh. The Archéophone is used by the Edison National Historic Site, Bowling Green State University (Bowling Green, Ohio), the Department of Special Collections at the University of California, Santa Barbara Library, and many other libraries and archives, including the Endpoint by The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

In an attempt to preserve the historic content of the recordings, cylinders can be read with a confocal microscope and converted to a digital audio format. The resulting sound clip in most cases sounds better than stylus playback from the original cylinder. Having an electronic version of the original recordings enables archivists to open access to the recordings to a wider audience. This technique also has the potential to allow for reconstruction of damaged or broken cylinders.

<doc id="125661" wikidata="Q312212" url="?curid=125661" title="Battle of Nördlingen (1634)">
<text>The Battle of Nördlingen, fought over two days from 5 to 6 September 1634, was a major battle of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. A Imperial-Spanish force led by the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand and Ferdinand of Hungary inflicted a crushing defeat on the Swedish-German army led by Gustav Horn and Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar.

By 1634, the Swedes and their German allies occupied much of southern Germany. This allowed them to block the Spanish Road, an overland supply route running from Italy to Flanders, used by the Spanish to support their war against the Dutch Republic. Seeking to re-open this, a Spanish army under the Cardinal-Infante linked up with an Imperial force near Nördlingen, which was held by a Swedish garrison.

Horn and Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar marched to its relief, but significantly underestimated the numbers they faced. After limited fighting on 5 September, on the 6th they launched a series of assaults south of Nördlingen, all of which were repulsed. Superior numbers meant the Spanish-Imperial commanders could continually reinforce their positions, and Horn eventually began to retreat. As they did so, they were outflanked by Imperial cavalry and the Protestant army collapsed. 

Defeat had far-reaching territorial and strategic consequences. The Swedes withdrew from Bavaria, and in the May 1635 Peace of Prague, their German allies made peace with Emperor Ferdinand II. France now intervened on behalf of Sweden and the Dutch Republic, and responded by declaring war on Spain, and entering the Thirty Years&#x27; War as an active belligerent.

==Background==
Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years&#x27; War began in June 1630 when nearly 18,000 troops under Gustavus Adolphus landed in the Duchy of Pomerania. Provided with subsidies as part of a French policy of opposition to the Habsburgs, and supported by Saxony and Brandenburg-Prussia, Gustavus won a series of victories over Imperial forces, including Breitenfeld in September 1631, then Rain in April 1632. 

Despite the death of Gustavus at Lützen in November, Sweden and its German Protestant allies formed the Heilbronn League in April 1633, once again financed by France. In July, the coalition defeated an Imperial army at Oldendorf in Lower Saxony; a few months later, Emperor Ferdinand II dismissed his leading general Albrecht von Wallenstein, who was assassinated by Imperial agents in February 1634.

The removal of Wallenstein made Emperor Ferdinand more reliant on the Spanish, Since their primary objective was re-opening the Spanish Road to support their campaign against the Dutch Republic, the focus now shifted to the Rhineland and Bavaria. Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, newly appointed Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, recruited an army of 11,700 in Italy, which in May crossed the Alps through the Stelvio Pass. At Rheinfelden, he linked up with forces previously commanded by the Duke of Feria, who died in January 1634. This brought his numbers up to 18,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. 

The Swedish army and their German allies largely operated as separate units, each with their own objectives. While Johan Banér and Hans von Arnim invaded Bohemia, Gustav Horn tried to block the Spanish by investing Überlingen, and Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar sought to consolidate his position in Franconia by taking Kronach. Neither attempt was successful and left Regensburg isolated, which was besieged on 23 May by an Imperial army of 25,000 under Ferdinand of Hungary. Horn and Bernhard met at Augsburg on 12 July and marched towards the Bohemian border, hoping the threat of them combining with Arnim would force Ferdinand to abandon the siege. 

Although they defeated an Imperial blocking force under Johann von Aldringen at Landshut on 22 July, the siege continued and Regensburg surrendered on 26 July. With 15,000 men, Ferdinand marched down the Danube (&quot;see Map&quot;) and reached Donauwörth on 26 August, where he turned aside to besiege the Swedish-held town of Nördlingen, which had to be taken before continuing his advance. Horn and Bernhard marched to Bopfingen but delayed their attack; with both sides short of supplies and suffering from plague, they were confident the outnumbered Imperials would have to withdraw. 

However, on 2 September the Imperial and Spanish armies linked up, and Nördlingen nearly fell to an assault two days later. The Protestant commanders agreed the political impact of losing the town outweighed the military risk of accepting battle. Although they had just been joined by 3,400 men under Scharffenstein, Horn wanted to wait for additional troops, which were a week&#x27;s march away. Bernhard argued they could not wait and urged an immediate attack, while he estimated the Spanish reinforcements as less than 7,000. The true figure was over 18,000, which meant the Habsburg army totalled over 33,000, compared to the Protestant figure of around 26,000. This included 8,000 poorly trained Württemberg militia, many of whom had previously served in the Imperial army.

==Battle==
Early on 5 September, the Protestant army broke camp and first feinted west as if retreating to Ulm, then moved across country to seize a line of hills two kilometres south of Nördlingen. From west to east, these included the Himmelrech, Ländle, Lachberg, Heselberg, and Albuch, the latter arguably being the most important. Their goal was to seize the Albuch, which would allow them to gain a positional advantage over the Spanish left. In response, the Cardinal-Infante ordered several several units to occupy the line of hills, with Spanish troops being placed in the forested hill of Heselberg.

Around 16:00, troops led by Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar made contact with Spanish and Imperial pickets on the Himmelreich, which they quickly captured. They also occupied the Ländle and Lachberg, before the advance was stopped on the Heselberg by 200 musketeers of the Tercio of Fuenclara. Gustav Horn had to order the Swedish infantry to fully commit to the Heselberg with cannons being utilized to bombard the Spanish. The combat over the Heselberg ended up lasting until midnight. 

The failure of the Swedes to capture the Heselberg was exactly what the Cardinal-Infante needed as he knew that pinning Gustav Horn&#x27;s men on the hill would buy him time to secure the Albuch. In knowing so, the Cardinal-Infante had already instructed Cerbellón and the Tercio of Toraldo to construct light fortifications and earthworks on the Albuch. The Spanish would eventually fall back from the Heselberg next morning &quot;(2:00 am, 6 September)&quot; and reach their positions at the Albuch. 

This was occupied by 6,600 Spanish under Count Leganés and Cerbellón, and 1,500 Bavarian infantry under Ottavio Piccolomini, who also spent the night digging trenches and positions for a battery of 14 guns, along with 2,800 Burgundian and Italian cavalry was stationed nearby on the flank. This means that the Spanish-Imperial side would have had some 10,000–10,900 men at the Albuch with the rest of their army holding a line running north to Nördlingen. On the opposing side, Horn would deploy 8,800 infantry divided in five brigades along with up to 4,000 cavalry and 800 dragoons; their objective would be to seize the Albuch hill. The rest of the Protestant army under Bernhard would mirror their Catholic counterpart in a line stretching north towards Nördlingen (&quot;see Phase 1 map above&quot;). 

In the rearguard, 2,000–2,500 Württemberg militia were left to protect the baggage train. Including 4,000 cavalry led by Scharffenstein, Horn had a force of 13,600 men with which to take the Albuch, opposed by 10,000 Imperial troops whose loss would force the Spanish-Imperial forces to retreat and abandon the siege of Nördlingen. At the same time, Bernhard&#x27;s troops would be tasked with distracting the Imperial right, although it soon became clear he was badly outnumbered and thus restricted to limited skirmishing. At 5:00 am on 6 September, the Swedish artillery opened fire on the Albuch, followed by a general assault led by the Scottish and Vitzhum brigades along with 3 cavalry squadrons. Scharffenstein&#x27;s men were quickly repelled by the Spanish cavalry, but the relatively inexperienced infantry gave ground as the Scottish and Vitzhum brigades beat them back. 

With the breakthrough in the centre of the Albuch, Horn believed that he had a great victory at hand, not knowing more failures were to come. Salm&#x27;s and Wurmser&#x27;s infantry was in absolute disorder; routing from the Albuch. It was only the Tercio of Idiáquez, composed of veteran Spanish troops (&quot;españoles viejos&quot;), that would save the day with their actions. The veteran Spaniards would drop their pikes in face of their routing German allies, daring to kill any who try to leave the battlefield. With this bold action, the German allies rallied back into the fight. The Tercio of Idiáquez, deployed in the Spanish &quot;escuadron&quot; formation employed by the Cardinal-Infante, with a &quot;manga&quot; of arquebusiers preceding along with some cavalry squadrons, counterattacked the Swedes at the breach with devastating effect by taking advantage of the explosion of a powder wagon; and routing the Scottish and Vitzhum brigades in less than an hour. 

By 6:00 am, the Imperial troops had regained full control of the Albuch. Whilst reorganizing the Scottish and Vitzhum brigades, Horn sent his own personal &quot;Horn brigade&quot; and the Rantzau brigade, along with some cavalry, to once again attack the center of the Albuch in order to maintain pressure. Unlike the last assault, the Protestants were met by the veteran Spanish units instead of the German levies and could not get as close to the enemy positions. On the other side of the battlefield, Bernhard and the Catholic opposition made no movements but continued with their artillery duel. Meanwhile, at the Albuch, the Swedish brigades were suffering heavy losses from the Spanish musket fire. 

Horn rallied his men for a fourth attack; this time with the Scottish, Vitzhum, and Württemberg brigades along with the cavalry. Much like the previous assault, this one failed in the face of heavy musket fire and the Protestant cavalry failed to best the Catholic cavalry in their engagement. While reorganizing his force at 7:30 am, Horn sent a messenger to Bernhard asking for reinforcements. Bernhard then sent the Thurn brigade over to the Albuch. During the next hour, Horn continued to launch several assaults on the Spanish position, mainly with the Scottish and Horn brigades; yet despite their near &#x27;suicidal&#x27; attacks, each assault was repulsed. The superior number of troops elsewhere in the battlefield allowed Leganés and Gallas to feed in a constant stream of fresh troops to support their comrades on the Albuch. By 8:00 am, the Thurn brigade was also engaged against the Tercio of Toraldo, and despite receiving reinforcements, their attack also failed (&quot;see Phase 2 map above&quot;). 

On the left flank of the Protestants, the dragoons of Taudapel were able to block a party of Croats trying to outflank them near Kleinerdlingen. Further to the right of the dragoons, Bernhard moved his first line of cavalry, making way through the Catholic skirmishers to reach the Catholics&#x27; main line. They were met with intense musket fire from the Bavarian infantry near Herkheim. While in disorder from the enemy volleys, they were counterattacked by the Catholic cavalry supported by musketeers from the Tercio of Fuenclara and had to retreat to their previous positions while Bernhard sent 5 cavalry squadrons to restore the situation. By 9:30 am, Horn and his men were exhausted, and even in the case where the Catholic side suffered casualties, the Protestants had taken the worst of it. After a last attack before 10:00 am, Horn&#x27;s men were much dispersed by now and the Albuch was deemed out of reach and so in a short meeting between the Protestant commanders, they decided to stop the offensive and hold the positions along the line of hills to wait for the night and withdraw towards Ulm. 

Once the Catholics noted that their adversaries were pulling back, a general advance was ordered. The Protestant cavalry on the left was engaged in melee combat by the Catholic cavalry and was defeated; leading into a rout of the cavalry and dragoons towards the Ländle hill with Gratz being captured during his attempt to rally his troops. This exposed Bernhard&#x27;s infantry on the other hills, while Croat light cavalry simultaneously outflanked him on the left. The Imperial, Bavarian, and Spanish cavalry then attacked the Protestants on the Heselberg supported by Bavarian infantry and musketers of the Tercio of Fuenclara; driving into the woods and destroying the Protestant infantry in the process. Horn soon realized that there was combat at the Heselberg hill. With the Spanish infantry and cavalry from the Albuch advancing simultaneously, squadrons of Imperial cuirassiers then appeared charging out of the woods, cutting Horn&#x27;s retreat. A massacre ensued, with the Catholic side and especially the Spanish, showing relentless brutality.

Under this pressure, the Protestant army disintegrated despite attempts to rally them, and suffered heavy losses during the pursuit (&quot;see Phase 3 map above&quot;). Two thousand of the militia guarding the baggage were killed and another 4,000 taken prisoner, most of whom then enrolled in the Imperial army. Scharffenstein, previously a senior commander in the Bavarian army, was captured and later executed for treason; Horn was also taken and held in custody until 1642. Including prisoners, the Protestants suffered a total of 12,000 to 14,000 casualties, compared to 3,500 for their opponents; Bernhard and von Taupadel reached Heilbronn with the remaining 12,000 men (&quot;according to Wilson&#x27;s figures&quot;) a few days later. Primary accounts suggest that another 9,000 of the Protestant troops who survived the battle were pursued and mostly killed.

==Aftermath==
Nördlingen effectively destroyed Swedish power in southern Germany, and has been described by some commentators as &quot;arguably the most important battle of the war&quot;. Van der Essen states that the battle was &quot;above all a Spanish victory,&quot; owing credit to the Spaniards and their general for their feats. Despite being his first major field battle, the Cardinal-Infante, along with his German allies, had pulled off a victory to be remembered for centuries. In response to his first &#x27;masterpiece,&#x27; the Cardinal-Infante spared not the praising of his own troops, acknowledging his subordinates and their men for their valor in battle. He eventually continued on his path with his army the towards the Spanish Netherlands and arrived a hero governor of the Lowlands, with the people displaying their gratitude to his successes. The Cardinal-Infante would continue to conduct multitudes of campaigns against the Dutch and French in the upcoming years, experiencing much success despite fighting a two-front war.

The Imperial army retook most of Württemberg and moved into the Rhineland, while Swedish Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna faced pressure from his domestic opponents to end the war. Oxenstierna himself also stated that &quot;the misfortune was so terrible that it couldn&#x27;t have been worse.&quot; In December, two of their main allies, Saxony and Hesse-Darmstadt, negotiated a peace agreement with Emperor Ferdinand, later formalised in the May 1635 Treaty of Prague. Its terms included the dissolution of the Heilbronn and Catholic Leagues and the treaty is generally seen as the point when the Thirty Years&#x27; War ceased to be primarily a German religious conflict. 

However, the collapse of the anti-Habsburg alliance in Germany now prompted direct French intervention. In February 1635, Cardinal Richelieu signed a treaty agreeing a joint Franco-Dutch offensive in the Spanish Netherlands, while a French army under Henri, Duke of Rohan, cut the Spanish Road by invading the Valtellina in March. This was followed in April by a new alliance with Sweden, as well as financing an army of 12,000 under Bernard of Saxe-Weimar in the Rhineland. In May, France formally declared war on Spain, starting the 1635 to 1659 Franco-Spanish War.

==Government==

===Local government===
North Haledon is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by North Haledon is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of North Haledon is Republican Randolph J. &quot;Randy&quot; George, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2026. Members of the North Haledon Borough Council are Council President Bruce O. Iacobelli (R, 2025), Rocco Luisi (R, 2023), Vince Parmese (R, 2025), George Pomianek (R, 2024), Donna Puglisi (R, 2024), and Jacqueline Roscio (R, 2023).

In December 2019, Sandra Salviano was selected from a list of three candidates nominated by the municipal committee to fill the term expiring in December 2022 that had been become vacant following the death earlier that month of her husband, Keith Salviano. Sandra Salviano served on an interim basis until the November 2020 general election, when she was elected to serve the balance of the term of office, though she stepped down from office in February 2021 and was replaced by Vince Parmese, who was elected in November 2021 to serve the remainder of the term.

In 2013, Mayor Randy George was criticized by residents for his use of two borough-owned generators in the persistent electric outages during the days following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy to provide power to the refrigerators in his ice cream store, while Police Chief Robert Bracco had used another municipal-owned generator to provide power at his home. A special committee formed of borough council members found that the actions were justifiable in light of the circumstances and enabled them to serve the borough during the emergency, but recommended that rules be established to govern personal use of borough property by municipal employees and officials.

===Federal, state, and county representation===
North Haledon is located in the 9th Congressional District and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s 35th state legislative district.

For ninth through twelfth grades, public school students attend Manchester Regional High School, which serves students from Haledon, North Haledon, and Prospect Park. The school is located in Haledon. North Haledon residents had successfully voted in 2003 to leave the district, choosing to send their high school aged students to Midland Park High School in nearby Bergen County, New Jersey. In August 2004, the New Jersey Supreme Court decided against North Haledon, citing that the town&#x27;s exit from the district would shift the ethnic and racial balance of the high school. As of the 2023–24 school year, the high school had an enrollment of 819 students and 60.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.7:1. Seats on the high school district&#x27;s nine-member board of education are allocated based on the population of the constituent districts, with four seats assigned to North Haledon.

<text>Passaic ( or ) is a city in Passaic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city was the state&#x27;s 16th-most-populous municipality, with a population of 70,537, falling behind Bayonne (ranked 16th in 2010), an increase of 756 (+1.1%) from the 2010 census count of 69,781, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,920 residents (+2.8%) from the 2000 census population of 67,861. The Census Bureau&#x27;s Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 68,903 for 2023, making it the 552nd-most populous municipality in the nation. Among cities with more than 50,000 people, Passaic was the fifth-most densely populated municipality in the United States, with more than 22,000 people per square mile.

Located north of Newark on the Passaic River, it was first settled in 1678 by Dutch traders, as Acquackanonk Township. The city and river get their name from the Lenape word &quot;pahsayèk&quot; which has been variously attributed to mean &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;place where the land splits.&quot;

==History==

The city originated from a Dutch settlement on the Passaic River established in 1679 which was called Acquackanonk. Industrial growth began in the 19th century, as Passaic became a textile and metalworking center.

A commercial center formed around a wharf at the foot of present-day Main Avenue. This came to be commonly known as Acquackanonk Landing, and the settlement that grew around it became known as the Village of Acquackanonk Landing or simply Acquackanonk Landing Settlement. In 1854 Alfred Speer (later owner of the city&#x27;s first newspaper and public hall) and Judge Henry Simmons were the principals in a political battle over the naming of village. Simmons wished to keep the old name while Speer wanted to simplify it to Passaic Village. Speer was losing the battle however he convinced the U.S. Postmaster General to adopt the name, and hung a Passaic sign at the local railroad depot. The de facto name change was effective.

Passaic was formed as an unincorporated village within Acquackanonk Township (now Clifton) on March 10, 1869. It was incorporated as an independent village on March 21, 1871. Passaic was chartered as a city on April 2, 1873. The Okonite company owned an industrial site here from 1878 to 1993. It was the company&#x27;s headquarters and primary manufacturing plant for most of the company&#x27;s history. Early uses of the company&#x27;s insulated wires include some of the earliest telegraph cables, and the wiring for Thomas Edison&#x27;s first generating plant, Pearl Street Station in Lower Manhattan. The property was then turned into a furniture factory, whose owners have been attempting to redevelop the property into an upscale mall since 2015.

The 1926 Passaic Textile Strike led by union organizer Albert Weisbord saw 36,000 mill workers leave their jobs to oppose wage cuts demanded by the textile industry. The workers successfully fought to keep their wages unchanged but did not receive recognition of their union by the mill owners.

Passaic has been called &quot;The Birthplace of Television&quot;. In 1931, experimental television station W2XCD began transmitting from DeForest Radio Corporation in Passaic. It has been called the first television station to transmit to the home, and was the first such station to broadcast a feature film. Allen B. DuMont, formerly DeForest&#x27;s chief engineer, opened pioneering TV manufacturer DuMont Laboratories in Passaic in 1937, and started the DuMont Television Network, the world&#x27;s first commercial television network, in 1946.

In 1992, the voters of Passaic Township in Morris County voted to change the name of their municipality to Long Hill Township, to avoid confusion between the City of Passaic and the largely rural community away, as well as association with the more urban city.

Passaic is served by two regional newspapers, &quot;The Record&quot; and &quot;Herald News&quot; which are both owned by the Gannett company and its predecessor North Jersey Media Group.

The city previously had many of its own newspaper companies, among them Speer&#x27;s &quot;The Passaic Item&quot; (1870–1904), the &quot;Passaic City Herald&quot; (1872–1899), the &quot;Passaic Daily Times&quot; (1882–1887), the &quot;Passaic City Record&quot; (1890–1907), the &quot;Passaic Daily News&quot; (1891–1929), the &quot;Passaic Daily Herald&quot; (1899–1929), and the &quot;Passaic Herald News&quot; (1932–1987). The &quot;Passaic Herald News&quot; went through several mergers with other Passaic County newspapers to become the current &quot;Herald News&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 3.24 square miles (8.39 km2), including 3.13 square miles (8.11 km2) of land and 0.11 square miles (0.28 km2) of water (3.33%).

Passaic&#x27;s only land border is with neighboring Clifton, which borders Passaic to the north, south, and west. The namesake Passaic River forms the eastern border of Passaic. Four additional neighboring municipalities in southern Bergen County, immediately across the river from Passaic, are East Rutherford, Garfield, Rutherford, and Wallington.

Passaic and Wallington are connected via the Gregory Avenue, Market Street, and Eighth Street bridges. The city connects with Garfield at both the Monroe and Passaic Street Bridges. The road connection with Rutherford is via the Union Avenue Bridge, which is located on an extension off the northbound lanes of Route 21. One cannot cross from Passaic into East Rutherford by vehicle directly, however, as there is no bridge directly connecting the two municipalities. Drivers wanting to cross from Passaic to East Rutherford must use either the Gregory Avenue Bridge, which is located near Wallington&#x27;s line with East Rutherford, or the Union Avenue Bridge, where East Rutherford can be accessed via surface streets briefly passing through Rutherford.

Passaic is located from New York City, and from Newark Airport.

===The city===

Passaic has several business districts: Main Avenue begins in Passaic Park and follows the curve of the river to downtown. Broadway runs east–west through the center of the city, ending at Main Avenue in downtown. Main Avenue has many shops, restaurants, and businesses reflecting the city&#x27;s growing Latino, and declining Eastern European populations in the city.

The city is home to several architecturally notable churches, including St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church, First Presbyterian of Passaic, and St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church.

====Passaic Park====
Many residents of the Passaic Park section of Passaic are part of Orthodox Jewish communities.

It is home to over 20 yeshivas and other educational institutions, as well as many kosher food and other shopping establishments.

The Passaic Park section is noted for its large park and large homes of various architectural styles, especially Queen Anne and Tudor. Several condominium and cooperative apartment complexes are also located there including:
* Carlton Tower, a condominium of 21 floors, the city&#x27;s tallest structure
* Passaic Towers Apartments, rental across the street from Carlton Tower
* Barry Gardens, co-operative garden apartments built following World War II on a portion of the former Barry Estate
* Presidential Towers, condominium at 180 Lafayette Ave.

===Climate===

==Government==
===Local government===

Passaic is governed by the Faulkner Act system of municipal government, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council (Plan B), enacted by direct petition as of July 1, 1973. The city is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. Under this form of government, the governing body is comprised of a mayor and a city council. The mayor is elected directly by the voters for a four-year term of office. The seven members of the city council serve four-year terms on a staggered basis, with either three seats (together with the mayoral seat) or four seats up for election in odd-numbered years. Elections are non-partisan, with all positions selected at-large in balloting held in May.

, Passaic&#x27;s mayor is Hector Carlos Lora, whose term of office ends June 30, 2025. Lora was appointed in 2016 to fill a vacancy that followed the resignation of Democratic mayor Alex Blanco after he was indicted on federal corruption charges; Lora was the Director of the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders at the time and chose to resign his position and accept an appointment to serve as Mayor and finish the remainder of Blanco&#x27;s unexpired term. Lora was elected to a full term in 2017. Members of the Passaic City Council are Council President Gary Schaer (term ends 2023), Jose R. &quot;Joe&quot; Garcia (2025), Terrence L. Love (2025), Thania Melo (2023), Chaim M. Munk (2023) and Daniel J. Schwartz (2025), with one seat currently declared vacant.

The seat expiring in June 2023 that had been held by Salim Patel was declared vacant in June 2022, after it was determined that he had missed more council meetings than allowed by statute.

In addition to his role as council president, Schaer also holds a seat in the 36th Legislative District of the New Jersey General Assembly. This dual position, often called double dipping, is allowed under a grandfather clause in the state law enacted by the New Jersey Legislature and signed into law by Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine in September 2007 that prevents dual-office-holding but allows those who had held both positions as of February 1, 2008, to retain both posts.

Corruption charges over the past decades have resulted in the federal convictions of two mayors, seven councilman and other public officials, all members of the Democratic Party. Passaic Business Administrator Anthony Ianoco was terminated in February 2011, after he was charged with cocaine possession, following his arrest in Hoboken, where police arrested him after he was caught driving the wrong way in a Passaic city vehicle.

Alex Blanco became the first Dominican-American elected as mayor in the United States winning a special election in November 2008 to succeed acting mayor Gary Schaer, who as City Council president automatically moved into the position upon the resignation by previous mayor Samuel Rivera, after Rivera pleaded guilty to corruption charges. Blanco was elected to serve the remainder of Rivera&#x27;s term, and was re-elected to a full term on May 12, 2009, with 53.1% of votes cast. He won running against Passaic Board of Education member Vinny Capuana.

In November 2016, Blanco pled guilty to a single federal count of bribery, agreeing to resign immediately Blanco admitted in court to accepting $110,000 in bribes from two unnamed housing developers in exchange for directing more than $200,000 in HUD funds to a failed low-income housing development. He faced up to 10 years in federal prison upon sentencing, scheduled for February 2017. He was succeeded by Passaic County Freeholder Hector Lora, in an appointment made by the City Council. Blanco is the second consecutive elected mayor of Passaic, and the third in two decades (following Joseph Lipari and Sammy Rivera), to be convicted of or plead guilty to official misconduct charges.
