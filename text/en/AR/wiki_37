<text>Dearborn is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Dearborn borders Detroit to the south and west, roughly west of downtown Detroit. In the 2020 census, it had a population of 109,976, ranking as the seventh-most populous city in Michigan. Dearborn is best known as the hometown of the Ford Motor Company and of its founder, Henry Ford.

The first written settlement of Dearborn is from the 18th century by French Canadian voyageurs who initially called the settlement La Belle Fontaine or Place aux Fontaines because of the abundant springs in the city. Therefore, Dearborn was once named Springwells, an anglicization of the French name. The settlement was connected to the Detroit River ribbon farm communities and other farms connected to the Rouge River and the Sauk Trail. The community grew in the 19th century with the establishment of the Detroit Arsenal on the Chicago Road linking Detroit and Chicago. During the 20th century, it developed as a major manufacturing hub for the automotive industry.

Henry Ford was born on a farm that was once at the intersection of Ford Road and Greenfield Road. Ford later built his estate, Fair Lane, and his River Rouge Complex, the largest factory of his empire, in Dearborn. He developed mass production of automobiles, and based the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company here. The city has a campus of the University of Michigan, and Henry Ford College. The Henry Ford is the largest indoor-outdoor historic museum complex in the United States, and Metro Detroit&#x27;s leading tourist attraction.

Dearborn residents are Americans primarily of European or Middle Eastern ancestry, many descendants of 19th and 20th-century immigrants. The census identifies primary European ethnicities as German, Polish, Irish, and Italian. New waves of immigration came from the Middle East in the late 20th century, mostly Muslims and far less Christians minorities from Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Dearborn has the proportionally largest Muslim population in the United States and the largest mosque in North America. In 2023, Dearborn became the first Arab majority city in the US, with 55% of its residents claiming to be of Middle Eastern or North African ancestry in a 2023 census.

==History==
Before European encounter, the area had been inhabited for thousands of years by successive First Nations peoples. Historical tribes belonged mostly to the Algonquian-language family, especially the Council of Three Fires, the Potawatomi and related peoples. In contrast, the Huron (Wyandot) were Iroquoian speaking. French colonists had a trading post at Fort Detroit and a settlement developed there in the colonial period. Another developed on the south side of the Detroit River in what is now southwestern Ontario, near a Huron mission village. French and French-Canadian colonists also established farms at Dearborn in this period. France ceded all of its territory east of the Mississippi River in North America to Great Britain in 1763 after losing to Britain in the Seven Years&#x27; War.

Beginning in 1786, after the United States gained independence in the American Revolutionary War, more European Americans entered this region, settling in Detroit and the Dearborn area. With population growth, Dearborn Township was formed in 1833 and the village of Dearbornville in 1836, each named after Henry Dearborn, a general in the American Revolution who became Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson. The Town of Dearborn was incorporated in 1893. Through much of the 19th century, the area was largely rural and dependent on agriculture.

Stimulated by industrial development in Detroit and within its own limits, in 1927 Dearborn was established as a city. Its current borders result from a 1928 consolidation vote that merged Dearborn and neighboring Fordson (previously known as Springwells), which feared being absorbed into expanding Detroit.

According to historian James W. Loewen, in his book &quot;Sundown Towns&quot; (2005), Dearborn discouraged African Americans from settling in the city. In the early 20th century, both white and black people migrated to Detroit for industrial jobs. Over time, some city residents relocated in the suburbs. Many of Dearborn&#x27;s residents &quot;took pride in the saying, &#x27;The sun never set on a Negro in Dearborn&#x27;&quot;. According to Orville Hubbard, the segregationist mayor of Dearborn from 1942 to 1978, &quot;as far as he was concerned, it was against the law for a Negro to live in his suburb.&quot; Hubbard told the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; in the mid-1950s, &quot;Negroes can&#x27;t get in here. Every time we hear of a Negro moving in, we respond quicker than you do to a fire.&quot;

The area between Dearborn and Fordson was undeveloped, and remains so in part. Once farm land, much of this property was bought by Henry Ford for his estate, Fair Lane, and for the Ford Motor Company World Headquarters. Later developments in this corridor were the Ford airport (later converted to the Dearborn Proving Grounds), and other Ford administrative and development facilities.

More recent additions are The Henry Ford (a reconstructed historic village and museum), the Henry Ford Centennial Library, the super-regional shopping mall Fairlane Town Center, and the Ford Performing Arts Center. The open land is planted with sunflowers and often with Ford&#x27;s favorite crop of soybeans. The crops are never harvested.

The Arab American National Museum (AANM) opened in 2005, the first museum in the world devoted to Arab American history and culture. Arab Americans in Dearborn include descendants of Lebanese Christians who immigrated in the early twentieth century to work in the auto industry, and more recent Arab immigrants and their descendants from other, primarily Muslim nations.

On February 2, 2024, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; published an opinion piece titled &quot;Welcome to Dearborn, America&#x27;s Jihad Capital&quot;, claiming that there were a large number of supporters of Islamic extremism in the area. Mayor Abdullah Hammoud said the article was inflammatory and was responsible for increased online hate speech against the city&#x27;s citizens, so he increased police patrols.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.37%) is water. The city developed on both sides of the Rouge River. An artificial waterfall/low head dam was constructed by Henry Ford on his estate to power its powerhouse. The Upper, Middle, and Lower Branches of the river come together in Dearborn. The river is widened and channeled near the Rouge Plant to allow lake freighter access.

Fordson Island () is an island about three miles (5 km) upriver on the River Rouge from its confluence with the Detroit River. It is the only major island in a tributary to the Detroit River. It was created in 1922 when engineers dug a secondary trench to reroute the River Rouge to increase navigability for shipping purposes, and businesses needed it to be navigable by the large lake freighters. The island is privately owned, has no public access, and is part of the city of Dearborn which has no frontage along the Detroit River.

Dearborn is among a small number of municipalities that own property in other cities. It owns the Camp Dearborn in Milford, Michigan, which is located from Dearborn. Dearborn was among an even smaller number of cities that hold property in another state. For a time, the city owned the Dearborn Towers apartment complex in Clearwater, Florida, but this has been sold. Camp Dearborn is considered part of the city of Dearborn. Revenues generated by camp admissions are incorporated into the city&#x27;s budget.

The average household size was 2.65 and the average family size was 3.42.

In the city, 27.8% of the population was under the age of 18, 8.3% was from 18 to 24, 29.2% from 25 to 44, 19.1% from 45 to 64, and 15.6% was 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years.

The median income for a household in the city was $44,560, and the median income for a family was $53,060. Males had a median income of $45,114 versus $33,872 for females. The per capita income for the city was $21,488. About 12.2% of families and 16.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 24.4% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 and over.

As of the 2012 estimate, Dearborn&#x27;s population was thought to have fallen to 96,474, a decrease of 1.7% since 2010. Over the same period, though, SEMCOG, the local statistics agency of Metro Detroit Council of Governments, has estimated the city to have grown to 99,001, or an increase of 1.2% since 2000. SEMCOG&#x27;s July 2014 estimate listed Dearborn with a population of 102,566.

===Ethnic groups===
Dearborn has a large community of descendants of ethnic Europeans who arrived as immigrants from the mid-19th into the 20th centuries. Their ancestors generally first settled in Detroit: Irish, German, Italians, and Polish. It is also a center of Maltese American settlement, from the Mediterranean island of Malta. Also attracted to jobs in the auto industry, some were among immigrant Maltese who first settled in Corktown.

The city has a small African-American population, many of whose ancestors came to the area from the rural South during the Great Migration of the early twentieth century.

The city&#x27;s population includes 40,000 Arab Americans. Per the 2000 census, Arab Americans totaled 29,181 or 29.85% of Dearborn&#x27;s population; many are descendants of families who have been in the city since the early 20th century. The city has the largest proportion of Arab Americans in the United States. As of 2006 Dearborn has the largest Lebanese American population in the United States.

The first Arab immigrants came in the early-to-mid-20th century to work in the automotive industry and were chiefly Lebanese Christians (Maronites). Other immigrants from the Middle East, such as Assyrians, have also immigrated to the area. Since then, Arab immigrants from Yemen, Iraq and the Palestinian territories, most of whom are Muslim, have joined them. Lebanese Americans comprise the largest group of ethnic Arabs. The Arab Muslim community has built the Islamic Center of America, the largest mosque in North America, and the Dearborn Mosque. More Iraqi refugees have come, fleeing the continued war in their country since 2003.

Warren Avenue has become the commercial center of the Arab-American community. The Arab American National Museum is located in Dearborn. The museum was opened in January 2005 to celebrate the Arab American community&#x27;s history, culture and contributions to the United States.

In the 2019 U.S. Census estimates, the largest ethnic group were Lebanese Americans, and the second largest were Yemeni Americans.

===Christian missionaries and politicians===
In 2010, Nabeel Qureshi, David Wood, and two other people acting as Christian missionaries, were arrested at the Dearborn International Arab Festival. They had been handing out Christian literature aimed at Muslim believers. The four were prosecuted for breach of the peace. Police ordered them to stop filming the incident, to provide identification, and to move at least five blocks from the border of the fair. After reviewing the video evidence, the jury acquitted the defendants. The four defendants filed a separate civil suit against the city. Dearborn was found to have violated their constitutional rights related to freedom of speech. The city settled the lawsuit and issued a formal apology to the individuals.

Sharron Angle, a Republican senatorial candidate in Nevada, said in an October 2010 political speech that the Arab Americans in Dearborn contributed to a &quot;militant terrorist situation,&quot; and that the city government was enforcing Islamic &quot;sharia&quot; law. Mayor Jack O&#x27;Reilly strongly criticized Angle, saying, &quot;She took it as face value and maligned the city of Dearborn and I consider that totally irresponsible&quot;.

Preacher Terry Jones of Gainesville, Florida, known for burning a Quran, the sacred book of Islam, planned a protest in 2011 outside the Islamic Center of America. Local authorities required him either to post a $45,000 &quot;peace bond&quot; to cover Dearborn&#x27;s cost if Jones incited violence, or to go to trial. Jones contested that requirement, and he and his co-pastor Wayne Sapp refused to post the bond. They were held briefly in jail, while claiming violation of First Amendment rights. That night Jones was released by the court. The ACLU had filed an &quot;amicus brief&quot; in support of Jones&#x27;s protest plans. One week later, on April 29, Jones led a rally at the Dearborn City Hall, in a designated free speech zone. Riot police were called out to control counter protesters. Jones also planned to speak at the annual Arab Festival on June 18, 2011, but his route was blocked by protesters, six of whom were arrested. Police said they did not have enough officers present to maintain safety. Christian missionaries accompanied Jones with their own protest signs.

On November 11, 2011, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Robert Ziolkowski vacated the &quot;breach of peace&quot; ruling against Jones and Sapp on the grounds that they were denied due process. On April 7, 2012, Jones led another protest in front of the Islamic Center of America, where he spoke about Islam and free speech. The mosque officials had locked it down to prevent damage. The city used thirty police cars to block traffic from the area in an effort to prevent a counter protest.

===Public libraries===

Dearborn Public Library includes the Henry Ford Centennial Library, which is the main library; and the Bryant and Esper branches.

Dearborn&#x27;s first public library opened in 1924 at the building now known as the Bryant Branch. This served as the main library until the Ford library opened in 1969. In 1970 what became known as the Mason building was classified as a branch library. The library was renamed in 1977 after Katharine Wright Bryant, who developed a plan for the library and campaigned for it.

Around April 1963 the Ford Motor Company granted the City of Dearborn $3 million to build a library as a memorial to Henry Ford. The company deeded of vacant land for the public library to the city on July 30, 1963, the centennial or 100th anniversary of Henry Ford&#x27;s birth. The Ford Foundation later granted the library an additional $500,000 for supplies and equipment. On November 25, 1969, the library was dedicated. Originally only the library had offices in the building but in 1979, the library gave up the western side&#x27;s meeting rooms for the City of Dearborn Health Department.

The Esper Branch, the smallest branch, is located in what is known as the Arab residential quarter of the city, dedicated on October 12, 1953. Originally named the Warren Branch, this structure had replaced the Northeast Branch, which opened in a storefront in 1944. In October 1961, it was named after city councilman Anthony M. Esper.

===Post office===
During the years 1934 to 1943, during and after the Great Depression, murals were commissioned for federal public buildings in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.

==Politics==

Dearborn has historically firmly voted for the Democratic Party.

In 2021, Niraj Warikoo of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reported that Yemeni Americans in Dearborn were advocating for more of a role in their city&#x27;s government.

In the 2022 Michigan elections, there was a shift in east Dearborn (heavily Arab and Muslim) toward the Republican Party as LGBTQ+ materials in schools became a political issue. According to Niraj Warikoo of &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, &quot;Democrats still won the city overall by a comfortable margin&quot;.

In the 2024 Michigan Democratic presidential primary, the Uncommitted vote won a majority in Dearborn, as well as in the cities of Hamtramck and Dearborn Heights. All three cities have a significant Arab American and Muslim population. They protested against Biden over his handling of the Israel–Hamas war.

In the run-up to the 2024 United States presidential election, mayor Abdullah Hammoud refused to endorse President Joe Biden for re-election due to the government&#x27;s position in the Israel–Hamas war. In that election, within Dearborn, 42.48% of the voters voted for Trump, 36.26% voted for Kamala Harris, and 18.37% voted for Jill Stein, the Green party candidate. Trump became the first Republican to win the city since the 2000 presidential election.

<text>Ecorse ( &quot;&quot;) is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 9,512 at the 2010 census.

Ecorse is part of the Downriver community within Metro Detroit. The city shares a northwestern border with the city of Detroit and also borders the cities of Lincoln Park to the west, River Rouge to the north, and Wyandotte to the south. The city shares its name with the Ecorse River, which forms its southern border with Wyandotte. The Detroit River forms the city&#x27;s eastern border as part of the Canada–United States border with LaSalle, Ontario.

==Etymology==
Native American tribes of this area used this area as a burial ground. When French colonists settled here in the last two decades of the 18th century, they named the waterway &quot;&quot;Rivière Aux Échorches&quot;,&quot; which means &quot;The River of the Barks&quot; in English.

==History==
In 1836, after the community had become part of United States territory, it was settled by more English speakers, who named it Grand Port. The community was unincorporated within Ecorse Township. In 1903 the settlement was incorporated as the village of Ecorse. With the opening of its first steel mill in 1923, Michigan Steel Mill, Ecorse began to become an economic force in the region. The village incorporated as a city in 1942.

Since the later 20th century and restructuring of heavy industry, the city, like many industrial inner-ring suburbs, has fallen into economic decline. In December 1986, the Wayne County Circuit Court issued a court order appointing a receiver for the bankrupt city. The receivership would last until August 1990, but the city&#x27;s finances were monitored by the state of Michigan for another ten years.

By September 2009, with the city facing a $9 million deficit and a federal corruption probe, Governor Jennifer Granholm declared a financial emergency for Ecorse, and appointed an emergency financial manager. On September 25, 2009, Ecorse Mayor Herbert Worthy and city Controller Erwin Hollenquest were arrested on charges of conspiracy, bribery, and fraud.

On May 1, 2013, the City of Ecorse was moved from under an emergency manager to a state transition advisory board, which includes the previous emergency manager.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (24.12%) is water.

The Detroit River forms the eastern border of the city, and the Ecorse River forms the southern boundary. Mud Island within the Detroit River is part of Ecorse and is included in the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge.

===Public libraries===
Ecorse Public Library is located in the city. Two Dearborn architects, Bennett and Straight, designed the current library complex, which was built to be fireproof.

The first library services appeared in Ecorse in 1922, when a group of books from the Wayne County Library Service were placed for local use at Loveland&#x27;s Pharmacy. During the following year, the owner of the pharmacy moved his business to gain a larger space and dedicated a section of the new location to the library. Due to a lack of space for a new book collection, library services were stopped in 1925. Services resumed on March 22, 1926, when the library re-opened in the DeWallot building with 600 volumes of books; for the first time the library had its own quarters. By 1929 the Ecorse library had four staff members. Two operated other library branches in Ecorse: one in the Ecorse Municipal Building and one located on Visger Road.

The current Ecorse Public Library opened on December 12, 1948, with a dedication by Mayor William Vosine. The library&#x27;s cost was $150,000. The American Library Association selected the library as one of the best small libraries in the United States.

==Parks and recreation==

<text>Flat Rock is a city in Wayne County, Michigan, United States, with a small portion of the city extending into Monroe County. At the 2020 census, the population was 10,541.

==History==
Flat Rock began as a Wyandot settlement. It was later designated as a reservation for the Wyandot, and still functioned as such in 1830.

The first European-American settlers in Flat Rock were Michael Vreeland and his five grown sons between 1811 and 1820. Vreeland had been captured by British Rangers during the Revolutionary War and released after American independence. The family purchased . The town was called the &quot;Village of Vreeland&quot; until 1838, when the Vreeland family sold off most of the land and relinquished control of the area. The Vreeland families built the first grain and lumber mill, having brought the grinding stones from New York. Descendants of Michael Vreeland still live in the town and attend Flat Rock public schools, being the seventh generation to reside in the town their family founded.

The first mention of any settlers in the area later to become Flat Rock was made by a French priest, Father Jean Dilhet. In describing his parish in 1798 he included &quot;Grosse Roche&quot;, referring to a settlement named after the outcropping of limestone rock on the south side of the Huron River.

In 1818, a land office opened in Detroit, and Soloman Sibley purchased of land. In 1824 it was sold to Michael and Jacob Vreeland. Vreeland and Smooth Rock villages were platted on part of this acreage. At this time there were Huron, Seneca, and Wyandot Indian villages in the area.

With the Erie Canal opening in 1825, many people, especially from New York, came to Michigan to settle. By 1828 the village had four stores, two saw mills, a wool carding mill, a flour mill, and 250 inhabitants - serving as a center mainly for farmers who lived in the area immediately surrounding the settlement.

The village of Flat Rock was platted and recorded in 1838 by the Gibraltar and Flat Rock Land Co. They were attempting to build a canal to connect Lake Erie with Lake Michigan. This effort ultimately failed.

Henry Ford was attracted to the water power of the Huron River, and in 1925 he established the Ford Motor Company Lamp Factory along its banks. The Flat Rock Dam was constructed to provide hydroelectricity to the factory.

The area was incorporated as a village in 1923 and as a city in 1965.

In 2021, Ford Motor Company dumped benzene into the city sewer system, causing 1,100 people to evacuate their homes.

== Geography ==
Flat Rock is in southern Wayne County, but a very small portion of the city lies to the south in Monroe County, because the border along the Huron River follows the course of the river in 1923, the year Flat Rock was incorporated as a village. At the time, the river had two meanders, but they have since been filled in. The city is bordered to the northeast by Woodhaven, to the southeast by Rockwood, and to the south, across the Huron River in Monroe County, by South Rockwood.

U.S. Route 24 (Telegraph Road) passes through the center of Flat Rock, leading north to the western part of Dearborn and southwest the same distance to Monroe. Interstate 75 runs along the eastern border of Flat Rock, with direct access from Exit 29 (Gibraltar Road). I-75 leads northeast to Detroit and southwest to Toledo, Ohio.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city of Flat Rock has a total area of , of which are land and , or 2.06%, are water.

The city is listed by the U.S. Census Bureau as belonging to both Wayne County and Monroe County. In the 2010 census, the city is listed as having a total land area of , while mentioning no measurable land area or population statistics within Monroe County. However, the city is still listed in several categories as being part of Monroe County. The official Flat Rock city website also mentions the city&#x27;s boundaries extending into Monroe County.

Flat Rock has a higher overall tornado average than the state of Michigan as a whole, and a 40% greater average than the United States as a whole. Two F4 tornadoes have hit Flat Rock—one in 1956 and another in 1965 resulting in 23 deaths and over 300 injuries.

<text>Garden City is a city in Wayne County of the U.S. state of Michigan. A western suburb of Detroit, Garden City is located roughly west of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 27,380. Garden City is notable as the home of the first locations of Kmart and Little Caesars.

== History ==
The origins of Garden City started with the transfer of the property to John Lathers from Andrew Jackson for in October 1835. The city was patterned after the &quot;garden city&quot; concept that became popular in England during the 19th century, with most home sites sectioned off into plots to allow adequate farming area to support the family with fruit and vegetables. Most sites are now considerably smaller, some as small as 40 feet by 135 feet, with little room for gardening of fruits and vegetables, though the city maintains some large lots where an extra street has not been placed between two of the older streets, such as between some parts of Bock Street and John Hauk Street where Donnelly Avenue does not cut through.

In June 1927, Garden City became a village within Nankin Township, with Arnold Folker as Village President. Six years later the village became the city of Garden City. Areas of interest in Garden City include the first Kmart store (opened in 1962, closed in early 2017, now demolished), the first Little Caesars (opened in May 1959, closed in October 2018), located at 32594 Cherry Hill Road, and the first dine-in McDonald&#x27;s in Michigan. The Folker Building, a gray stone structure located at the southeast corner of Ford and Middlebelt Roads, at what is considered downtown Garden City, was the first city hall. It later contained Orin Jewelers and other retail establishments. A new city hall was eventually constructed on Middlebelt Road between Ford and Warren Roads. The honeymoon cottage of Henry Ford and his wife, Clara Jane Bryant, was moved here from Dearborn in 1952.

The main source of education for Garden City is their school district, Garden City School District, which includes four elementary schools, one middle school, one public high school which also houses a performing arts center and a swimming pool, and an alternative education high school called Cambridge High School. During the baby boom, a second high school was constructed, Garden City West High School, with teams called the Tigers. At that time, Garden City High School, whose teams had the name the Panthers, was renamed Garden City High School - East. After the census at both schools declined, Garden City West became Garden City Middle School with the four middle schools from the baby boom being dissolved. These middle schools were Burger, Radcliff, Vogel, and Cambridge. Burger Middle School became Burger School for Students with Autism, which has been renamed to Burger Baylor School, while still being under the authority of Garden City Public Schools. Radcliff Middle School became a satellite campus for Schoolcraft College; the school has since sold Radcliff Center to the City for their Parks and Recreation Department. The former middle school and Schoolcraft campus are located directly next to the current Garden City Middle School. Vogel has since been razed, while Cambridge now serves as the district&#x27;s alternative high school. After the dissolution of the two high schools, Garden City East resumed the name Garden City High School, with teams now called the Cougars. Tipton Academy, a charter school serving grades PK-7, is also located in Garden City.

St. Raphael Catholic School in Garden City closed in 2016.

<doc id="119254" wikidata="Q2346899" url="?curid=119254" title="Grosse Ile Township, Michigan">
<text>Grosse Ile Township is a civil township of Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 10,777 at the 2020 census.

The township encompasses several islands in the Detroit River, of which the largest is named as Grosse Ile. Named by French explorers in 1679, &quot;Grosse Île&quot; means &quot;Big Island&quot;. Later taken under British rule after 1763, the island was not settled by European Americans until after the United States achieved independence in the American Revolutionary War. Grosse Ile Township was organized in 1914 after it split away from Monguagon Township.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (50.72%) is water.

Grosse Ile is the largest island on the Detroit River. The township of Grosse Ile is composed of twelve islands, although the community is most often identified with the main island (which residents simply refer to as &quot;The Island&quot;). Grosse Ile&#x27;s main island is technically composed of two islands. Grosse Ile Township is one of only seven municipalities in the state of Michigan to consist entirely of islands, including St. James Township, Drummond Township, Bois Blanc Township (in northern Michigan, not to be confused with the nearby Bois Blanc Island, which is in Canada), Mackinac Island, Peaine Township, and Sugar Island Township.

The tip of the main island&#x27;s northern section is named Hennepin Point in honor of the 17th-century French explorer Father Louis Hennepin. It is uninhabited and separated from the remainder of the northern section by an unnamed canal that cannot be navigated in a power boat.

The southern section of the main island is separated from the northern section by the Thorofare Canal, which runs on a diagonal course from east to west connecting the main channel of the Detroit River with the Trenton Channel of the river. The southern section of the main island is connected by bridges to Elba Island, Meso Island (also known as Upper Hickory Island), Hickory Island, and Swan Island, which are all inhabited.
Not far from the shoreline of the main island in the river lie Calf Island, Celeron Island (charted as Tawas Island), Dynamite (also known as Powder House Island), Fox Island, Stony Island, and Sugar Island, which are all uninhabited. Stony and Celeron are owned by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Calf Island is owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. The other islands are privately owned. The low-lying Mamajuda Island is off the northeastern tip of Grosse Ile and is visible only during times of low water level.

Two bridges connect the main island to the mainland of Michigan. The bridge on the north end of the island is called the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge (off-white color). The bridge on the south end of the island is officially named the Wayne County Bridge (light green in color), but is commonly called the &quot;Free Bridge&quot; by locals.

==History==
===Founding and early times===
The Potawatomi occupied areas of the island, which they called &quot;Kitcheminishen&quot;, for a long period prior to European encounter. They were one of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires.

The flags of three nations—France, England, and the United States—have flown over Detroit and Grosse Ile since the first French explorers visited the island during the late 17th century. The early French explorers named the island as &quot;la grosse île&quot;—the &quot;big island&quot; in French. Father Louis Hennepin, a Catholic priest and missionary, accompanied fellow French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1679 on the ship &quot;Le Griffon&quot; in exploring the Great Lakes. The Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church on Grosse Ile says that Father Hennepin came ashore and said mass at a location on the east shore of the island near the present site of St. Anne&#x27;s Chapel. No record exists of this event, but Father Hennepin wrote in his journals about the fruit orchards and wild animals on Grosse Ile, showing he was here. The north end of Grosse Ile is named Hennepin Point in his honor.

French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and his convoy of 25 canoes sailed down the Detroit River and camped on the shore of Grosse Ile during the evening of July 23, 1701. On the morning of July 24, Cadillac returned upriver and landed ashore, where he claimed French possession of the territory under the authority of King Louis XIV. This site is in present-day Detroit, near the present intersection of West Jefferson and Shelby streets.

Grosse Ile maintained its own name and identity as a community through the 18th century. The British established control of the island and present-day Michigan in 1763 after their victory in the French and Indian War. They anglicized the spelling to &quot;Grosse Isle&quot;.

Although the Potawatomi, like most Native Americans, did not have the same sense of property ownership as did Europeans and Americans, they considered the island to be part of their ancestral lands. On July 6, 1776, they deeded the island to brothers Alexander and William Macomb, brothers from Albany who had become leading fur traders and merchants in Detroit, partly from selling supplies to the British at Fort Detroit and the local Indian Department. They are considered to be the founders of the European-American community on the island.

===Settlement to present===
Settlement started in the 19th century. At least three homes still standing on the island were built during this period by a descendant or relative of the Macomb brothers. The Rucker Homestead, the oldest structure in use on Grosse Ile, has portions that date to 1816. The front structure was added by John Anthony Rucker in 1835. The Rucker-Stanton House on West River Road was built in 1848 by the great-grandson of William Macomb. The Wendell House on East River Road was built in the late 1860s by John Wendell, who married a granddaughter of William Macomb.

Westcroft Gardens, a Michigan Centennial Farm located on West River Road, is operated by descendants of the Macombs. Westcroft, which is open to the public, features a nursery well known for growing and selling hybrid azaleas and rhododendrons. Westcroft is one of the oldest farms in Michigan still owned by the same family. Most of the original buildings at Westcroft Gardens are still standing and well preserved.

Macomb Street of the central business district of Grosse Ile was named in honor of Alexander and William Macomb. A monument commemorating the day that the tribal chiefs and elders signed the deed to the Macomb brothers is located at the foot of Gray&#x27;s Drive and near the shoreline of the Detroit River. The original deed, which was written on parchment, is stored in the Burton Historical Collection at the Detroit Public Library.

===Trenton Channel and boating===

Boating has been both a means of transportation and recreation since the first residents lived on the island. Native Americans used canoes to travel between Grosse Ile&#x27;s islands and the mainland in Michigan and Canada. Early European settlers primarily used sail-powered vessels to travel to and from the islands.

By the late 19th century, Grosse Ile was known as a popular destination for recreational boaters. It was also served by steamboats operating from Detroit and small towns along the river and lakes. During this time period, Sugar Island, which is one of the twelve islands commonly considered to comprise Grosse Ile, featured an amusement park, dance pavilion, and bathing beach. Paddle steamers regularly carried people from Detroit and other points along the Michigan side of the Detroit River to Sugar Island.

During this era and into the early 20th century, a number of wealthy residents from Detroit and other nearby towns built summer homes along the shoreline (mainly on the southern end) of Grosse Ile in order to enjoy views of the Detroit River or Lake Erie. The interior section of the island was sparsely populated, as most of the land was undeveloped woodlands or part of farms. The residential population of Grosse Ile totaled 802 at the 1920 U.S. Census. The majority of houses were located around the perimeter of the island and main roads crossed the community chiefly in either a north–south or east–west direction.

In 1894, the federal government funded and constructed a series of channel range lights to assist ships to avoid shallow areas in the Detroit River and its shoreline. The northernmost of the channel range lights was the Grosse Ile Light, which is now the only lighthouse remaining on the island. The original 1894 Grosse Ile lighthouse resembled a water tower on stilts, as it was constructed on wooden pilings along with a walkway to shore.

It was rebuilt in 1906 and designed as the classic white structure that has become one of the iconic landmarks on the island. The lighthouse is considered a symbol of Grosse Ile; its image is used on the masthead of the &quot;Ile Camera&quot; community newspaper and many other places. The lighthouse&#x27;s beacon was turned off in the 1940s, and the structure is no longer an important navigation aid for lake freighters. Small boaters still refer to the lighthouse in their navigation of the area.

In 1965, the Grosse Ile Township purchased the lighthouse from the U.S. Department of the Interior for $350, with funds provided by the Grosse Ile Historical Society (GIHS). The GIHS was given the responsibility to preserve and maintain the lighthouse. The GIHS annually holds a tour of the lighthouse during a weekend each fall, which is the only time of the year that it is open to the public.

Island resident Cameron Waterman invented the outboard motor and successfully tested his invention during February 1905 in the ice-filled Detroit River off the shore of Grosse Ile. He established the Waterman Marine Motor Company in Detroit. The company eventually manufactured and sold up to 1,000 outboard motors per year until Waterman sold the business in 1917. During the fall of 2005, the GIHS celebrated the 100th anniversary of Waterman&#x27;s invention by hosting a public exhibition featuring fully restored Waterman outboard motors. These are highly collectible and very rare.

During the Prohibition era, Grosse Ile became a crossing point for bootleggers illegally smuggling alcoholic beverages from Canada. They typically arrived at the island via small speed boats. During the winter months, some daring smugglers drove cars across the frozen river.

===Aviation and military===

During the 1920s and 1930s, a small airport on the southern end of Grosse Ile was the location of historic early aviation activities. The Curtiss-Wright Flying Service operated a flying school at the airport. The Aircraft Development Corporation built the world&#x27;s first all-metal airship, the ZMC-2, for the Navy in a large hangar. Amelia Earhart is rumored to have stopped at the airfield on occasion.

Grosse Ile was the home of a U.S. Navy base for forty years. The U.S. Naval Air Station Grosse Ile opened in 1929 after three years of construction of seaplane and dirigible facilities. During World War II, the naval base developed into an important center for military flight training. The base was expanded considerably to accommodate large numbers of American and British fliers who trained on the island. As a young man during WWII, George H. W. Bush was stationed at the base for training during 1945 for about two months. He later became a politician and President of the United States.

During the height of the Cold War, in 1954 the U.S. Army installed an Ajax-Nike missile base at the airfield; it was functional until being decommissioned in 1963. The Navy closed the base during November 1969. The federal government transferred it in 1971 to the township government for civilian use as a municipal airport.

Today, the Grosse Ile Municipal Airport is used primarily for general aviation. It has also been the site of public airshows. Occasionally it serves as a temporary docking area for blimps that visit southeastern Michigan to fly over major sporting events. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) operated the Large Lakes Research Station in one of the buildings on the airport grounds, until its closure in 2019. The airport campus is also the site of Grosse Ile Township Hall, which was moved to this location in 2000 from Macomb Street, and a number of private businesses.

===Railroads and bridges===

In 1873 the Canada Southern Bridge Company, a subsidiary of the Canada Southern Railroad Company, established a railroad from the Michigan mainland to the island that carried both passengers and freight. The company laid tracks across Grosse Ile and built bridges over the Detroit River to enable trains to be transferred to a ferryboat on Stony Island (one of the islands near the east shoreline of Grosse Ile&#x27;s &quot;main island&quot;). Once on the ferryboat, the train cars were taken to Ontario, Canada across the river, where they were put back on a rail track to travel to Buffalo, New York and other points east. Canada Southern operated trains on this route for about ten years before ceasing service due to financial difficulties.

After Canada Southern ended its operations, the Michigan Central Railroad (MCR) operated a train that provided service between the island and Trenton, Michigan. From Trenton, travelers could connect with trains or streetcars to Detroit and other cities in the region. In 1904, the Michigan Central Railroad built a small brick and stone depot along the tracks near East River Road on the east side of the island.

Train service peaked during the early 20th century, but rapidly declined after Edward W. Voigt&#x27;s Grosse Ile Bridge Company opened the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge for automobile traffic on November 27, 1913 (Thanksgiving Day). The bridge, which is privately owned, is on the west side of the island and connects to the city of Riverview. After automobile traffic crossing the bridge became the most popular means of traveling to and from the island, the Michigan Central Railroad ceased daily passenger service in early 1924; in 1929 it ended its occasional freight service.

During 1931, the county government converted the Michigan Central Railroad&#x27;s defunct rail bridge crossing the Trenton Channel into the Wayne County Bridge for use by vehicular, bike and pedestrian traffic. The rail tracks across the island were replaced by a roadway that is now known as Grosse Ile Parkway. The Wayne County Bridge is commonly referred to as the &quot;Free Bridge&quot; by residents because of it does not charge a toll.

Today, about three-quarters of the vehicle traffic going to and from Grosse Ile travels over the Wayne County Bridge, while one-quarter crosses the Toll Bridge. The Toll Bridge has been hit twice by lake freighters, causing it to close temporarily (in 1965 and in 1992). The Wayne County Bridge was closed to vehicle traffic for major renovations between May 2, 2007, and December 21, 2007. During the 2007 county bridge closure period, the Toll Bridge provided the only route for vehicles to travel to and from the island.

===Grosse Ile Historic District===
Today, the MCR train depot is owned and operated as a community museum by the Grosse Ile Historical Society (GIHS). Nearby is the old U.S. Customs House, which was relocated to the current site in 1980 from Macomb Street. The GIHS also owns the Custom House, and these are the only structures in the National Historic District along East River Road that are regularly open to the public. The district features Saint James Episcopal Church, the oldest church building on the island, constructed during 1867 in part with funds provided by a freed slave named Elizabeth Denison. The district includes six homes, built from the 1840s to 1860s, that are outstanding examples of period architecture, particularly Gothic Revival and Jacobethan Revival.

===Modern times, growth and preservation===

Grosse Ile has good views of commercial shipping and pleasure boat traffic on the Detroit River. Lake freighters and oceangoing ships traveling to destinations around the Great Lakes regularly pass near the east side of the island, where the main channel of the Detroit River separates Grosse Ile from Ontario, Canada.

While the shoreline areas of Grosse Ile feature the majority of historically significant places and structures, approximately a dozen 1920s-era homes in the Jewell Colony subdivision, located in the middle of the island, are listed on the Michigan Register of Historic Places. Jewell Colony was the first planned subdivision on the island.

During the later 20th century, Grosse Ile had a significant increase in the rate of residential development, given its advantageous location and other amenities. By the 1980 census, the population of Grosse Ile had increased to approximately 9,300— about 106% over its population in the 1960 census.

Fearing the destruction of the natural character and small-town charm of the community, during the early 1990s the Grosse Ile Township established an &quot;Open Space Program&quot;, to be funded by a voter-approved dedicated local property tax to buy undeveloped land. The township acquired large tracts of environmentally sensitive land to slow the pace of development, preserve the environment, and protect housing values.

In 1993, a group of residents established a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization named the Grosse Ile Land &amp; Nature Conservancy, to aid in the protection and stewardship of the diverse natural resources on the island. A number of private owners donated environmentally important woodland and wetland areas to the Conservancy to protect them (and to get a tax write-off.) 

The U.S. EPA granted stewardship responsibilities to the Conservancy for a marsh and upland area on the federally owned section of the Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. This tract of land, which at one time was the location of the Navy&#x27;s seaplane base and later the Army&#x27;s Nike missile base, has been restored to its natural state; it features rich biodiversity and rare coastal wetlands. Named the Nature Area by the Conservancy, this land is periodically used by local teachers and Boy Scout groups to teach children about nature and the importance of conservation. 

Grosse Ile is a community of about 10,371 residents. &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Grosse Ile as one of the &quot;Top 100 Best Places to Live&quot; in 2009.

==Culture==

The annual &quot;Islandfest&quot; (formerly &quot;Azalea Festival&quot;) takes place around Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. On the same site as Islandfest, the Grosse Ile Youth Recreational Association (GIYRA), a 501c3 charity, runs a haunted house every Halloween. GIYRA coordinates the youth sporting events for the island children. The sports offered by GIYRA are Football and Cheer, Flag Football, Basketball, Baseball and Softball.

The island has an indoor tennis facility: six courts inside an old hangar at the city&#x27;s municipal airport. The Grosse Ile Soccer Association coordinates the township&#x27;s soccer league. The rapidly expanding soccer association, which started by hosting a recreational league, has expanded into a larger association. The Grosse Ile Soccer Association has more than 15 select travel / premier level teams on top of the in-house recreational program.

Grosse Ile&#x27;s community theatre, The Islanders, is Downriver&#x27;s oldest theatre club and one of the oldest civic theatre groups in the state of Michigan. The club has been active on Grosse Ile since 1925, when friends and neighbors developed a means of entertainment during the long Michigan winters. The first major play was produced on May 21, 1926, by a group of 40 founding members.

Grosse Ile social clubs include the Grosse Ile Yacht Club, the Ford Yacht Club, the Elba-Mar Boat Club, the Grosse Ile Golf and Country Club, West Shore Golf Course, Water&#x27;s Edge Golf Course, the Kiwanis Club of Grosse Ile, and the Grosse Ile Rotary Club (founded in 1947).

==Education==
Grosse Ile Township Schools serves the township.

On the island, there are two elementary schools: Parke Lane Elementary which serves grades K-2nd, and Meridian Elementary which serves grades 3rd-5th. The Grosse Ile Middle School enrolls students in 6–8, and Grosse Ile High School provides college preparatory education for grades 9–12. Their mascot is the Red Devil.

In 2001, Grosse Ile was ranked the highest out of 88 school districts in Michigan by &quot;The Detroit News&quot;.

==Demographics==
The U.S. Census Bureau also defined Grosse Ile Township as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2000 Census so that the community would appear on the list of places (like cities and villages) as well on the list of county subdivisions (like other townships). The final statistics for the township and the CDP were identical.

As of the census of 2020, there were 10,786 people, and 4,250 households residing in the township. The population density was 1,194.2 persons per square mile. The racial makeup of the township was 90.5% White, 3.4% African American, 0.2% Native American, 2.6% Asian, 0% Pacific Islander, and 3.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.2% of the population.

The median income for a household in the township was $125,469. The per capita income for the township was $65,696. About 3.2% of the population were below the poverty line.

The township is considered to be among the safest communities in Michigan.

<doc id="119255" wikidata="Q671188" url="?curid=119255" title="Tilting train">
<text>A tilting train is a train that has a mechanism enabling increased speed on regular rail tracks. As a train (or other vehicle) rounds a curve at speed, objects inside the train experience centrifugal force. This can cause packages to slide about or seated passengers to feel squashed by the outboard armrest, and standing passengers to lose their balance. In such excessive speeds, it could even cause the train to derail. Tilting trains are designed to counteract this by tilting the carriages towards the inside of the curve, thus compensating for the g-force. The train may be constructed such that inertial forces cause the tilting (&quot;passive tilt&quot;), or it may have a computer-controlled powered mechanism (&quot;active tilt&quot;).

The first passive tilting car design was built in the US in 1937, and an improved version was built in 1939. The beginning of World War II ended development. Talgo introduced a version based on their articulated bogie design in 1950s, and this concept was used on a number of commercial services. Among these was the UAC TurboTrain, which was the first (albeit short-lived) tilting train to enter commercial service in 1968 in the US and Canada. Japan similarly experimented, from the late 1960s, through the 591 Series that developed into the highly successful Hitachi 381 series, that has been in service since 1973.
In parallel Fiat Ferroviaria produced the experimental Y 0160 in 1970, that would evolve into the Pendolino family, in 1976, and operated in 11 countries. All of these had problems with short curves like those in switchyards, where they tended to sway about. Also, because of the way the carriages always swung outward, they placed more weight on the outside of the curve, which limited their improvement in cornering speed to about 20%.

Starting in the late 1960s, British Rail also began experiments with its Advanced Passenger Train (APT) which pioneered the active-tilt concept, along with in-cab signalling, to permit High Speed Rail services on conventional tracks. The APT family used hydraulic rams on the bottoms of the carriages to tilt them, rotating them around their centre point rather than swinging outward. This had the advantage of keeping the carriage centred over the bogies, which reduced load on the rails, and could be turned off when navigating switches. Due to lengthy political delays, the APT did not begin service testing until 1979, entering limited scheduled service in December 1981, the media describing the initial revenue run as both &quot;fifteen years late&quot;, and the &quot;queasy rider&quot;; the sets only briefly entering full revenue operation in 1985, before being withdrawn and the associated technologies sold to Alstom / Fiat Ferroviaria. By this time, the Canadian LRC design had become the first active tilting train to enter full commercial service, starting with Via Rail in 1981.

== Design ==

Aeroplanes and bicycles tilt inwards when cornering, but automobiles and trains cannot do this on their own. Vehicles with high centres of gravity rounding sharp curves at high speeds may topple over. To make their turns easier, the outer edge of a roadway of a high-speed highway or outer rail of a railway may be canted (raised) upward around the curve. The combination of tilt and centrifugal force combines to produce an effective acceleration that is down through the floor, reducing or eliminating any sideways component.

The particular angle of tilt (&quot;superelevation&quot;) is determined by the intended vehicle speed — higher speeds require more banking. However, with a growing desire in the 1960s and 1970s to build high-speed rail networks, a problem arose: the amount of tilt appropriate for high-speed trains would be over-tilted for lower-speed local passenger and freight trains sharing the lines. Japan&#x27;s early bullet train efforts of the 1960s avoided this problem by laying all-new lines as part of a re-gauging effort, and France&#x27;s TGV followed the same pattern. Other operators did not have this luxury and were generally limited to much lower speeds.

Spain&#x27;s national railway Renfe took a domestic invention, the Talgo, and developed it into a reliable high-speed train for a low-traffic-density railway. British Rail invested heavily in tilting-train technology to overcome the limitations of a rail network located in space-constrained built-up areas. Italy&#x27;s Trenitalia and the Japan National Railways have used tilting technology to speed express trains on conventional tracks through mountainous terrain.

Tilting trains are meant to help reduce the effects of centrifugal force on the human body, but they can still cause nausea, a problem that was widely seen on early &quot;passive&quot; tilting trains that exactly balanced the outward force. The effect could be felt under maximum speed and tilt, when the combination of tilting outside view and lack of corresponding sideways force can be disconcerting to passengers, like that of a &quot;thrill ride&quot;.

More limited and slower tilt could be achieved using active, or &#x27;forced&#x27;, tilting mechanisms. In trains adopting these mechanisms tilt is initiated by computers, which &#x27;force&#x27; train bodies to tilt at specific angles based on track information. This information could be stored on board or detected using a sensor at the front of the train or using Automatic train stop beacons. The slight delay in reacting to this information leads to a short period of sideways force while the cars react. It was found that when the cars tilt just at the beginning of the curves instead of while they are making the turns, there was no motion sickness. Researchers have found that if the tilting motion is reduced to compensate for 80% or less of lateral apparent force, then passengers feel more secure. Also, motion sickness on tilting trains can be essentially eliminated by adjusting the timing of when the cars tilt as they enter and leave the curves.

A similar technology widely adopted across Asia and Oceania, known as &quot;controlled passive tilt&quot;, achieves a similar effect by using on-board computers to limit tilt, initiated using inertia (as in traditional passive tilt). Automatic train stop beacons are used to inform computers of the precise location of these trains and limit natural tilt to angles specified by track data.

=== High-speed trains ===

A &quot;high-speed tilting train&quot; is a tilting train that operates at high speed, typically defined as by the European Union to include for upgraded track and or faster for new track.

Tilting trains operating at or more on upgraded track include the Acela in the US, the X 2000 in Sweden, the Pendolinos and Super Voyagers in the United Kingdom, and the ICE TD in Germany (the latter two being diesel powered).

Some older high-speed lines were built for lower line speeds (≤ ); newer tilting trainsets can maintain higher speeds on them. For example, the Japanese N700 Series Shinkansen may tilt up to one degree on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, allowing the trains to maintain even on radius curves that previously had a maximum speed of .

Many high-speed trainsets are designed to operate on purpose-built high-speed lines and then continue their journeys on legacy lines, upgraded or not. Where the legacy lines justify it, a tilting train may operate at higher speeds on the latter, even if below the normal threshold, whilst operating at or faster, usually with tilt disabled, on the high speed lines.

==History==

===Pendulum car===
The first experimental tilting train concept was the pendulum-suspension &quot;chair&quot; cars designed by the Pacific Railway Equipment Company. The first prototype, with an articulated bogie system, was built in 1937 and tested on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway that year. The company built another three pre-production models in 1939, using more conventional fore-and-aft bogies, and these saw some use with the &quot;San Diegan&quot;, among others. Mounted on high springs, the car tilted inwards on curves to counterbalance the cant deficiency with the induced centrifugal force. The opening of World War II prevented any immediate orders, and the concept was not revived in the post-war era.

===SNCF experiment===
In 1956, SNCF experimented with a self-propelled pendulum car, which also relied on centrifugal force. This experiment demonstrated the need for an active suspension system to tilt the coach bodies.

===Talgo Pendular===
The Spanish Talgo company had introduced the first widely successful shared-bogie system, which allowed cars to be connected end-to-end using a single bogie instead of each car having its own bogies at either end. This design saves weight and can reduce rail wear.

In the early 1950s, the Spanish National Railway, Renfe, experimented with passenger cars that combined the Talgo bogie with a new passive tilting system. This system used a large A-frame connected to the centre of the bogie that was as high as the cars. At the top of the A was a bearing system that the cars attached to, and a spring and damping system to smooth its motion. Because the cars were connected at this high point, they could swing to either side around the bearing axis, and this caused them to naturally pendulum outward on curves.

The first test of a Talgo in the United States was the &quot;John Quincy Adams&quot; with Fairbanks-Morse P-12-42 tested by the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad in 1957–1958. Due to technical troubles and the precarious financial state of the New Haven railroad, the trainset was stored. The idea caught the interest of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway, who began development of what would become the UAC TurboTrain using the same system. The TurboTrain entered service in the US and Canada in 1968.

The first successful European tilting train design was the Talgo in Spain, developed in the 1970s as a lightweight, fast train using passive tilt. Renfe, adopted the system widely, but was restricted to the Iberian peninsula initially.

The first full commercial application of passive tilting trains appeared in early 1980s with the Talgo Pendular. Talgo is currently in its 21st generation of production. Talgo trains are in service in various parts of Europe, and built under licence in Latin America and Asia. In North America, Amtrak uses Talgo trains in its &quot;Cascades&quot; service in the Northwest.

The first Talgo tilting series were the &quot;pendular&quot; ones from 400 series onwards.

===UAC TurboTrain===

The first tilting train to enter into regular service in North America was the UAC TurboTrain, used by Canadian National in 1968. Some figures have considered it to be the first tilting train in service in the world. It provided daily service between Montreal and Toronto at speeds of , until it was replaced by Bombardier LRC trains in 1982, reaching the maximum speed of during Canadian trials. TurboTrains were also operated by Amtrak between Boston and New York. The UAC Turbos had a passive tilt mechanism based on a four-bar arrangement, and they inspired the second generation of TALGO trains.

===Pendolino===
In Italy, the studies for a tilting train started in the mid 1960s and the concept was patented in 1967 by two engineers of Fiat railway materials, Franco di Maio and Luigi Santanera. A number of prototypes were built and tested, including an &quot;automotrice&quot; (self-propelled) derived from ALn 668, the ALn 668 1999 diesel car, provided with tilting seats to test the effects of active tilting technologies. The first working prototype using a tilting carbody was ETR Y 0160, an electrically powered car launched by FIAT in 1969. This was the first to be christened &quot;Pendolino&quot;.

This design led to the construction of an entire EMU in 1975, the ETR 401, built in two units by FIAT. One was put into public service on 2 July 1976 on the Rome-Ancona (later extended to Rimini) line, operated by Italian State Railways. Between Roma and Ancona (km. 295), the train took 2 hours 50 minutes, while ordinary trains took 3 hours 30 minutes. The train had four cars and was mostly considered a travelling laboratory for the new technology. Initially the ETR 401 was conceived as the first of a series of four trains, but the government lost interest to the project because of financial problems, and the project was temporarily interrupted, as the service in 1983. The train was used in demonstration campaigns to foreign countries like Germany, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. A second unit was built for service to the wide-gauge Renfe Spanish lines in 1977, under the nickname of Platanito. The service didn&#x27;t last of long, because problems with Spanish tracks made Platanito of little use.

New interest by the Italian government in the project in the mid 1980s, and the introduction of new technologies, led to the revision of the project with the ETR 401 with electronic systems, that led to the introduction of the slightly more advanced ETR 450, the first Pendolino to enter regular service in the world. Characterized by an 8-car configuration, and a maximum tilt reduced to 8° from the 10° of the ETR 401, for safety and comfort reasons, ETR 450 could run the Rome-Milan line in under four hours, at speeds up to . Passenger numbers increased from 220,000 in 1988 to 2.2 million in 1993.

In 1989, the old technologies and concepts of some parts of the ETR 450, and the introduction of new technologies in traction, led to the development of the next generation. The result was the ETR 460, styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro, a train that began service in 1996. Though plagued by technical problems, the ETR 460 introduced several innovations, such as more powerful AC asynchronous motors. The pistons actuating the tilting action were placed in the bogie instead of on the carbody sides: this permitted the reorganisation of the vestibules and passenger compartment areas, improving comfort. The bogie-to-body connection is extremely simple and easy to build, with maintenance advantages.

ETR 460 keeps axle load to an extremely low level (14.5 ton/axle), to allow the train to negotiate curves up to 35% faster than conventional Intercity trains (locomotive plus coaches). The body, which exploits large aluminium extrusion technology, has substantial modularity and allows for extremely low axle weight, whilst fully respecting the highest safety standards, and allows the best exploitation of the space with different loading gauges.

ETR 460 was built in only 10 units. Improved versions include ETR 470 for the Italo-Swiss Cisalpino company, the ETR 460 France, later called as ETR 463, used by FS to the route Milan Lione, and the ETR 480, used by Trenitalia under AC-powered Italian high speed lines. A total of 34 EMUs of the ETR 460/470/480 series were built for FS.

The development of the Pendolino technology continued in the Italian factories of Alstom and the next generation, the New Pendolino, was delivered to Trenitalia and Cisalpino as the ETR 600 and the ETR 610 from 2006.

Italian Pendolinos and their derivatives still represent the most popular solution for active tilting in passenger trains. The technology still in use today is almost the same developed by Fiat Ferroviaria in the 1960s-70s.

The British version of the Pendolino, the British Rail Class 390, is a electric tilting train operated by Avanti West Coast. It runs on the West Coast Main Line (London Euston to Glasgow Central, Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly). Class 390s commenced operation in 2001 with only one being in a major derailment. Due to signalling constraints, Class 390s are limited to in regular service.

===Japanese designs===
Japan was an early adopter of tilting trains and continues to use them on many express services. Due to the slow and twisty nature of its conventional-speed, narrow gauge network, tilting trains were introduced as a way to speed up services on its congested main lines. The interurban Odakyu Electric Railway began Japan&#x27;s first experiments in tilting technology in the 1960s by fitting pneumatic bogies to their electric railcars, while the Japanese National Railways pioneered their form of passive-tilt technology on their experimental 591 series EMU with commercial express services on mountain lines in mind. The 381 series was the first commercial tilting EMU in Asia, entering service in 1973 on the &quot;Shinano&quot; limited express services that operated on the hilly Chūō Main Line. The sets remained in operation until June 2024, when the last regularly scheduled trains ended on the &quot;Yakumo&quot; service.

During the final years of the Japanese National Railways, experimentation on mechanically-regulated passive tilt - a combination known as &#x27;controlled passive tilt&#x27; (制御付き自然振子式), where tilt is initiated passively but controlled (and slowed) by computers through mechanical active suspension - culminated post-privatisation with the 2000 series DMU, built for JR Shikoku and introduced on the &quot;Shiokaze&quot; and &quot;Nanpū&quot; limited express services in 1990. With problems of ride nausea and track wear alleviated, the benefits of tilting trains on the country&#x27;s mountainous Cape gauge (1,067mm) railway system soon became apparent and since then these &#x27;semi-active&#x27; tilting trains have seen widespread use on limited-express trains throughout the archipelago. Particularly well-known diesel and electric examples of this generation of tilting trains include JR Hokkaido&#x27;s KiHa 281 series, JR East&#x27;s E351 series, JR Central&#x27;s 383 series, JR Shikoku&#x27;s 8000 series, and JR Kyushu&#x27;s 885 series.

This generation of designs has seen some popularity overseas - the 8000 series serves as the basis of the Electric Tilt Train built for Queensland Rail&#x27;s Cape Gauge network. The 885 series, built as part of the Hitachi A-train family, serves as the basis of the Taiwanese TEMU1000 series tilting EMU for Taroko Express services, and some non-tilting variants including the British Rail Class 395 and British Rail Class 801.

Later developments in pneumatic active suspension - based on the DB Class 403 (1973) built decades earlier - created a generation of trains with more limited tilt (around 2°) but are more economical to build and easier to maintain. The experimental 300X built in 1995 developed into the N700 series, the first revenue-earning tilting Shinkansen unit in 2007. Applications to Shinkansen lines - which would not have benefitted greatly with mechanical tilting mechanisms due to their already shallow curves that allow high speeds - allowed for greater ride comfort, less track wear and slightly higher speeds leading to increased frequency. The simplicity of this technology made it possible for smaller private operators to introduce tilting trains, such as the Odakyu 50000 series VSE, a luxurious sightseeing express train with active suspension introduced not to increase speeds but to enhance ride comfort; and even cheap enough to be applied to commuter stock, such as JR Hokkaido&#x27;s KiHa 201 series, which improved speeds and frequencies on Sapporo&#x27;s partly non-electrified suburban railway system. This is also one of the only applications of tilting technology on &#x27;metro-style&#x27; commuter trains to date.. More modern and more numerous examples of active suspension and pneumatic tilting trains, include the &#x27;limited express&#x27; EMUs E353 series for JR East.

=== German designs ===
Deutsche Bundesbahn started tests with tilting trains in Germany with its Class 634 in 1967 when some Class 624 DMUs were equipped with passive tilting systems. As the passengers experienced motion sickness, the tilting technology was disabled and later removed. The tests continued with the prototypes of the following Class 614 units, but due to the again unsatisfying results the serial types were delivered without tilting system.

Another early train with tilting technology was Deutsche Bundesbahn&#x27;s Class 403 (today this number is used by ICE 3) high speed EMU. Following its InterCity services until 1979, it was also used for airport transfers between Düsseldorf and Frankfurt (see also: AiRail Service). Class 403 was able to tilt 4°, but the fixed pantographs limited this to 2°. Shortly after the train had gone into service, the tilting technology was disabled as many passengers experienced motion sickness because the pivotal point was too low.

The next attempt was made with DMUs and the proven Italian hydraulic active tilting system. Between 1988 and 1990, DB commissioned 20 Class 610 units for fast regional traffic. This time the results were quite satisfying and allowed a significant reduction of running times. The Class 610 sets was followed by the Class 611, which basically was built for the same purpose (fast regional traffic with up to on twisting non-electrified lines). The Class 611&#x27;s tilting system was electric, with a maximum 8° tilt, based on military technology from the Leopard tank. After entering service in 1996, this 50-unit class experienced problems both with the newly developed tilting system as well as chassis and axles, and was judged unsuccessful. The tilting system was out of service until 2006, when hardened axles and system updates solved the problems. In consideration of these problems DB ordered a full re-engineering, resulting in the development of Class 612. Starting in 1998, a total of 192 units were commissioned by DB. The tilting system proved to be reliable. In 2004, cracks were detected in a number of wheel sets, and again wheels and axles had to be replaced. Today Class 612 is back to tilting operation and forms the backbone of DB&#x27;s fast regional service on non-electrified lines. Additional units were sold to Croatia, where they are used for InterCity services.

In 1999 DB was able to use tilting technology for its InterCityExpress services, when with class 411 and 415 an electric high-speed tilting train was commissioned. While classes 401 to 403 (without tilting technology) were to cover the newly built or modernized high speed lines at up to (ICE 3 Class 403), Classes 411 and 415 with maximum speed of were designed for older twisting main lines. A total of 60 Class 411 and 11 Class 415 (shorter version) have been built so far. Both classes worked reliably until late 2008 when cracks were found on an axle during a routine check. The tilting mechanism has been switched off since 23 October 2008, and the maintenance intervals were drastically reduced which led to major service disruptions.

Much of the technical layout is derived from the ICE 3. Austria&#x27;s ÖBB has purchased three units in 2007, operating them jointly with DB for services from Germany to Austria. Even though DB assigned the name &quot;ICE-T&quot; to class 411/415, the &quot;T&quot; originally did not stand for &quot;tilting&quot; but for &quot;Triebwagen&quot; (self-propelled car), as DB&#x27;s marketing department at first deemed the top speed too low for assignment of the InterCityExpress brand and therefore planned to refer to this class as &quot;IC-T&quot; (InterCity-Triebwagen).

Rather luckless was Class 411/415&#x27;s adaptation for diesel services. In 2001, a total of 20 units were commissioned for use on the Dresden–Munich line, but these class 605 (ICE-TD) units experienced trouble from the start. After breaking an axle in 2002, all remaining 19 units (one fell off a working platform) were taken out of service. Even though one year later the trains were admitted to service again, DB judged their operation to be overly expensive. In 2006, those trains were used for amplifier trains and from 2008 to 2017, they ran on the Hamburg–Copenhagen route. Since 2018 and 2021, two units are in operation as the test train.

===Light, Rapid, Comfortable===

In 1966, a consortium of Canadian industrial firms began considering a conventionally-powered competitor to the TurboTrain, eventually emerging as the LRC (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) in the early 1970s. This design also used an active-tilt system, but one of very different form than the APT. The carriages rode on two C-shaped channels mounted across the top of the bogies. Tilt was accomplished by rams that pushed the bottom of the carriage side to side along these channels.

Amtrak experimented with the LRC in 1980, but retired it seven years later. In Canada, it entered service in 1981, beating the APT into service and becoming the first operational active-tilt system. The LRC carriages remain in use today, although the tilt mechanisms are being removed to reduce weight and maintenance costs.

Bombardier has since used updated versions of the LRC carriages for Amtrak&#x27;s Acela, the third generation of tilting ICE, the new generation of fast British trains (Super Voyager) and the experimental JetTrain.

===Advanced Passenger Train===

The Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was initially an experimental project by British Rail, with the train entering limited service in December 1981. Although eventually abandoned, the train was the pioneer of active tilt to negotiate tight curves at higher speeds than previous passive tilting trains. In the 1970s and 1980s, British Rail wanted an advanced fast train to negotiate Britain&#x27;s twisting and winding Victorian-era rail system. Conventional trains were limited in speed due to the curvature of the network. 

Engineers at the research division, opened in 1964, had done fundamental work on vehicle dynamics, with the APT to a degree an extension of this. The existing Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineers department was overlooked by the new project, creating resentment with its engineers. The work included experimentation with aluminium bodies, turbines, suspension and bogies, in cab signalling, automatic train protection, and active tilt.

The APT-E (E for experimental) was powered by gas turbines; the APT-P (P for prototype) was electric. With no tilting, the train was developed to break the British rail speed record. Tilting trains using passive tilt were not new, but it was uncommon and not widely implemented. The engineers decided that active tilt was the key to negotiating curves at much higher speeds.

The train had hydro-dynamic brakes and lightweight articulated bodies, with two power cars in the centre of the train. When the prototypes were built, worked and proven, the engineering development team was disbanded and the trains handed over to British Rail&#x27;s in-house engineering department to build. The developing engineers moved on to different fields while British Rail engineered the train into a production model. The BR engineers, who had little to no involvement in the development of the train, changed some of the prime and proven engineering aspects. For example, they changed the active tilt mechanism to pneumatic, rather than the well-developed and proven hydraulics.

The trains were introduced in 1981, but almost immediately taken out of service. During initial tests, some passengers complained of being nauseous due to the tilting motion. Subsequently, it was learned that this could be prevented by reducing the tilt slightly, so that there was still some sensation of cornering. The APT-P trains were quietly reintroduced to service in mid-1984 and ran regularly for a year, the teething problems having been corrected. However, under an in-house engineering management who felt slighted and by-passed in a project they had not developed, there was no political or managerial will to continue the project by building the projected APT-S production vehicles in numbers. Despite being an eventual success, the project was scrapped by British Rail in 1986, more for political reasons than technical.

Much of the technology developed for the power cars was subsequently used in the InterCity 225 Class 91 locomotives and Mark 4 carriages which were designed to be retrofitted with tilting equipment, which run on the East Coast Main Line route from London to Leeds and Edinburgh.

===X 2000===

In 1990, Swedish railways introduced a high speed service called X 2000. The train uses an active tilting system, enabling higher speeds of () on standard track. The train was also used in Norway and Denmark but later the train was removed from service in Norway. X2000 was a collaborative project by Kalmar Verkstad, Swedish railways and ASEA. The X 2000 has been tested in US, Canada, Australia and China.

===TGV Pendulaire===
In 1998, SNCF bowed to political pressure (the tilt-train was a credible threat to the TGV dedicated high-speed line network) and put in service an experimental TGV pendulaire. Only the passenger trailers were tilting while the two heavy power cars kept non-tilting bogies. Following the test program, it was converted back to a TGV-PSE train.

===InterCity Neigezug===
Switzerland got its first tilting train ever in its territory (discounting the Cisalpino, which entered Switzerland in 1996) on 28 May 2000. The ICN (&quot;InterCity Neigezug&quot;, or InterCity Tilting Train) was made by Bombardier, including a tilting-system designed by SIG (today ALSTOM). It began service on the line from Geneva via Biel/Bienne and Zürich to St Gallen. It was a major carrier in the national exhibition Expo.02.

===Bombardier Super Voyager===
Forty-four diesel-electric powered Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot; were ordered by Virgin CrossCountry to operate in tilt mode on the West Coast Main Line and between Oxford and Banbury. After the fleet was split between Arriva CrossCountry and Virgin Trains West Coast in 2007, the former disabled and later removed the tilting equipment from its Class 221s.

===Tilting Train Express===

The Tilting Train Express (TTX) or Hanvit 200 is a prototype six-car experimental tilting train developed and built in South Korea. Revealed in 2007, it had multiple test runs, including one which recorded a maximum speed of 223km/h. However, no production units were made as it was determined that it would be less costly to straighten existing trackage and banking the rails. It has done further test runs in 2014, however, to test the LTE-R system.

==Technology==


Many of the problems with motion sickness are related to the fact that traditional servo systems respond inappropriately to the changes in trajectory forces, and even small errors, whilst not being consciously perceivable, cause nausea due to their unfamiliar nature. The original Fiat ETR 401 used individual gyroscopes in each carriage so there was a lag, even though nausea had not been a major problem with this train. The APT was supposed to overcome this problem by using gyroscopes at the ends of the train and a leader/follower control system which defined a &quot;tilting curve&quot; for the whole train. It would appear that the technology of the era was unable to properly implement this technique.

Modern tilting trains profit from state-of-the-art signal processing which senses the line ahead and is able to predict optimal control signals for the individual carriages. Complaints about nausea have largely become a thing of the past.

Some tilting trains run on narrow-gauge railways. In Japan there are many narrow gauge lines in mountainous regions, and tilting trains have been designed to run there. In Australia, the service between Brisbane and Cairns by the QR Tilt Train claims to be the fastest narrow-gauge train in the world, running at . The Electric Tilt Train also holds the record for the fastest narrow-gauge train by maximum test speed, reaching 210 km/h.

With tilting EMUs, consideration is required on keeping the pantographs within the railway gauge. When mounted on top of a tilting car, the pantograph usually sways in the opposite direction in order to counter for the degree of tilting. This is done mechanically on for instance the British Class 390 Alstom Pendolino. On the German class 411 and 415, the pantographs are however mounted on a separate non-tilting frame within the cars.

<text>Grosse Pointe is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 5,678.

Grosse Pointe is an eastern suburb of Metro Detroit along Lake St. Clair. It is located along East Jefferson Avenue and shares a small northwestern border with the city of Detroit. It is one of five cities within the Grosse Pointe area. Grosse Pointe was originally incorporated as a village in 1880 and then as a city in 1934.

== History ==
It was incorporated as a city in 1934. There are five Grosse Pointes: Grosse Pointe Park, Grosse Pointe City, Grosse Pointe Farms, Grosse Pointe Woods and Grosse Pointe Shores.

Together with Grosse Pointe Park and Grosse Pointe Farms, the city comprises part of the southern Pointes, which are older and more densely populated than the northern Pointes (Grosse Pointe Woods and Grosse Pointe Shores). It became heavily populated between 1910 and 1930 as one of Detroit&#x27;s first commuter suburbs; in the previous century, Grosse Pointe was home to cottages, resorts, farms, and widely spaced lakefront mansions. Grosse Pointe (&quot;the City&quot;), Grosse Pointe Farms, and Grosse Pointe Park make up the Grosse Pointe South High School district. Grosse Pointe Woods and Grosse Pointe Shores make up the Grosse Pointe North High School district. Downtown Grosse Pointe, along Kercheval Avenue from Neff to Cadieux, nicknamed &quot;The Village,&quot; is considered by many locals to be the central downtown for all five of the Grosse Pointes, although each of them (except Grosse Pointe Shores) has several blocks of retail properties.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The water is part of Lake St. Clair.

The street layout of Grosse Pointe is basically a grid inside of its Cadieux, Mack, and Fisher Road boundaries. Inside this small rectangle, most blocks contain rows of single-family homes built between 1910 and 1950, on parcels wide on average. Some streets offer large backyards, such as Washington and Lakeland, while other streets are more compact. In some areas, homes are configured in a traditionally urban, close-together fashion, while other nearby blocks may offer yards up to wide.

Home sizes and styles vary widely, from , but slightly under on average. Most of the largest homes are within a few blocks of the lakefront; there are several blocks of mansions south of Kercheval Avenue. Predominant architecture includes the neo-Georgian, Tudor revival, Dutch Colonial, and arts and crafts styles. Some Victorian homes and traditional bungalow homes can also be found, mostly just north and south of the Village retail district. Some blocks, generally just south of the Village, have townhouses and apartments. Most of these were built in the 1920s, and can be seen along St. Paul, Maumee, and Jefferson avenues, mostly west of Rivard Boulevard, and between Notre Dame and Cadieux south of the Village retail district.

There are retail and low-rise office buildings along Kercheval Avenue in the Village district, on Fisher Road near Grosse Pointe South High School, and along Mack Avenue bordering Detroit.

== Climate ==
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters.

<text>Grosse Pointe Farms is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 10,148 at the 2020 census.

As part of the Grosse Pointe collection of cities, it is a northeastern city of Metro Detroit and shares a small western border with the city of Detroit. Grosse Pointe Farms was originally incorporated as a village in 1893 and again as a city in 1949.

== History ==
The area that would become Grosse Pointe Farms was originally incorporated as the Village of Grosse Pointe in 1879. By 1889, the village extended from land just above Provencal Road in the northeast to Cadieux Road in the west. In 1893, the portion of the village east of Fisher Road broke off and incorporated as the Village of Grosse Pointe Farms after a dispute over the location of a tavern. It was not until 1949, however, that the village incorporated as a city.

The U.S. Postal Service operates the Grosse Pointe Post office in Grosse Pointe Farms.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The water is part of Lake St. Clair.

The Farms has a more varied topography and streetscape than the other southern Grosse Pointes. While Grosse Pointe and Grosse Pointe Park are built on a standard street grid and are basically flat, Grosse Pointe Farms is partially built on the same grid flowing out of Detroit, but also features districts with irregular, curving street paths. A low but noticeable ridge runs through the center of the city. The Farms also contains the &quot;point&quot; in Grosse Pointe, where, just east of the Grosse Pointe War Memorial, there is a large bend in the lakeshore, such that those on the shoreline face east, instead of south, as they do when on the shoreline of neighboring Grosse Pointe, closer to the entrance of the Detroit River.

The cityscape varies widely, with large sections of old homes ranging from bungalows to mansions, and a few newer sections with ranch houses or luxury homes built on subdivided estates. The Farms has a downtown on Kercheval Avenue combining historic buildings with newer, neo-traditional storefronts.

<text>Grosse Pointe Park is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 11,555 at the 2010 census.

Bordering on Detroit with frontage on southern Lake St. Clair, it is the southernmost of the Grosse Pointe suburbs. Grosse Pointe Park was incorporated as a village in 1907 and again as a city in 1950.

== History ==

Before incorporation as a city, the area that would become the city of Grosse Pointe Park was incorporated as the Village of Fairview, which spanned Bewick Street in the west to Cadieux Road in the east in Grosse Pointe Township. The city of Detroit annexed part of the village in the township from Bewick Street to Alter Road in 1907. Fearing further annexation, the part of the village east of Alter Road incorporated as the Village of Grosse Pointe Park later that year. Seeking further annexation protection from Detroit and independence from its township, the village reincorporated as a city in 1950.

In November 2021, Grosse Pointe Park elected its first female mayor, Michele Hodges.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The water is part of Lake St. Clair. Grosse Pointe Park has about of borders with Detroit, with one border between Alter Road and Wayburn to the southwest, and another along Mack Avenue to the northwest; its third border on land is with the city of Grosse Pointe along Cadieux Road to the northeast.

=== Description ===
The neighborhoods in Grosse Pointe Park are built on a standard grid street pattern which flows out of Detroit, and housing ranges from tightly-packed single- and multi-family brick houses on the far west side of the Park, to rows of traditionally-styled single family homes generally averaging over , to multimillion-dollar mansions, some of which are found on the lakeshore. The west side of the city features mixed-use neighborhoods, where retail, schools, and churches are within close walking distance. The rest of the city is basically residential, but at the eastern edge residents are in close walking distance to &quot;the Village&quot; shopping district in Grosse Pointe. Many of the houses in the Park were built prior to World War II, and many of these were designed by noted architects using the finest materials. Windmill Pointe Drive, and streets such as Bishop, Kensington, Yorkshire, Edgemont Park, Three Mile Drive, Devonshire, Buckingham, Berkshire, Balfour, Middlesex, and Nottingham among others, each have dozens of large, architecturally significant homes. These mansions and mini-mansions were often placed on large lots which were often split up, the result being that some post-war ranch style homes are mixed in with homes of traditional design.

Grosse Pointe Park includes a large neighborhood located on Windmill Pointe, the edge of which marks the entrance to the Detroit River and the end of Lake St. Clair. A large lakefront park with a pool, gym, movie theaters, and gathering spaces for residents only is found at this spot. At the base of the point, at the foot of Three Mile Drive, is another large park, Patterson Park, which is known for its skating rink and walking trails. One way that people distinguish geography in Grosse Pointe Park is by location north or south of Jefferson Avenue, the south side being generalized as Windmill Pointe.

The Park also includes a section known as the &quot;cabbage patch,&quot; an area of town with multi-family houses in contrast to the single-family homes with larger lots that populate the vast majority of the Grosse Pointes. The cabbage patch is generally considered to be the northwest corner of the city, bounded by Mack, Wayburn, Jefferson, and Somerset, with a small extension south of Jefferson on Nottingham and Beaconsfield. The region&#x27;s name can be seen in various local establishments such as the Cabbage Patch Cafe and Cabbage Patch Saloon.

Grosse Pointe Park, along with Grosse Pointe and Grosse Pointe Farms, is in the Grosse Pointe South High School district. The elementary school in the Park: Defer, is in addition to one middle school: Pierce Middle School. The eastern Park is also served by Maire Elementary in Grosse Pointe in the Village district. Then serves the one high school, South High School off Fisher Road. There is one private school in the Park, the K-8 St. Clare of Montefalco Catholic School on Charlevoix and Audubon streets.

<doc id="119263" wikidata="Q1013717" url="?curid=119263" title="Hamtramck, Michigan">
<text>Hamtramck ( ) is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An enclave of Detroit, Hamtramck is located roughly north of downtown Detroit, and is surrounded by Detroit on most sides. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 28,433, and was by far the most densely populated municipality in Michigan. It is notable as the only Muslim-majority city in the United States.

Known in the 20th century as a center of Polish-American life and culture, Hamtramck has attracted new immigrants in the 21st century, especially from Yemen, Bangladesh and Pakistan. In 2013, it reportedly became the first Muslim-majority city in the U.S. In 2015, Hamtramck became the first city to have a Muslim-majority city council in the history of the United States, with four of the six council members being Muslim.

==Etymology==
Hamtramck is named for the French-Canadian soldier Jean-François Hamtramck, who was the first American commander of Fort Shelby, the fortification at Detroit. It was originally known as Hamtramck Township.

==History==

Hamtramck was originally settled by German farmers, but Polish immigrants moved into the area when the Dodge Brothers plant opened in 1914. Poles previously made up a large proportion of the population. It is sometimes confused with Poletown, a traditional Polish neighborhood, which used to lie mostly in the city of Detroit and includes a small part of Hamtramck. As of the 2010 American Community Survey, 14.5% of Hamtramck&#x27;s population is of Polish origin whereas in 1970 it was 90% Polish.

Circa the 1920s and 1930s, people had bars active and publicly made them visible, which was against Prohibition.

Over the past thirty years, a large number of Muslim immigrants from the Middle East (especially Yemen), South Asia, and the Balkans have moved to the city. As of the 2010 American Community Survey, the city&#x27;s foreign born population stood at 41.1%, making it Michigan&#x27;s most internationally diverse city (&quot;see more at Demographics below&quot;). The population was 43,355 in the 1950 Census and 18,372 in 1990.

Hamtramck was primarily farmland, although the Detroit Stove Works employed 1,300 workers to manufacture stoves. In 1901, part of the township incorporated as a village to gain more control over the settlement&#x27;s affairs, and by 1922 the village was reincorporated as a city to fend off annexation attempts by the neighboring city of Detroit. By the mid-1920s, 78% of the residents of Hamtramck owned their own houses or were buying their houses. Around that time, the factory workers made up 85% of Hamtramck&#x27;s heads of households. Of those factory workers, about 50% were categorized as not skilled workers. In 1910, the newly founded Dodge Main assembly plant created jobs for thousands of workers and led to additional millions of dollars in the city. Dodge Main quickly expanded and became important to Hamtramck. Before the construction of Dodge Main, Hamtramck was a largely rural town. The establishment of the Dodge Main assembly plant led to a large influx of Polish immigrants who pushed out the incumbent German politicians. It was after this that Hamtramck was considered a Polish-American town.

By the end of the 20th century and the closing of Dodge Main, followed closely by General Motors razing of key parts of the Polish neighborhoods, the ethnicity of the region quickly shifted from traditionally Polish descendants to new Middle Eastern and South Asian immigrants. By the elections of 2015, the city is suggested to have been the first to elect a Muslim-majority council in the country.

In November 2021, Hamtramck elected a completely Muslim-American city council and a Muslim mayor, becoming the first municipality in the United States to be governed entirely by Muslim-Americans. In June 2023, the city drew scrutiny for its ban of the rainbow flag on city property and perceived homophobia.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Hamtramck is mostly surrounded by Detroit except for its small common border with the city of Highland Park, which is in turn also mostly surrounded by Detroit. Hamtramck lies about from the center of Detroit. The I-75 freeway roughly runs along this city&#x27;s western border, and I-94 runs near its southern border.

According to Keith Matheny of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, the urban layout assists recent immigrants who do not yet have the credentials to drive an automobile, as Hamtramck is &quot;uniquely walkable&quot; and a &quot;tight size&quot;.

==Culture==
Hamtramck flourished from 1910 to 1920 as thousands of European immigrants, particularly Poles, were attracted by the growing automobile industry. The city has grown increasingly ethnically diverse in subsequent years but still bears many reminders of its Polish ancestry in family names, street names and businesses. A 2018 survey found that 16 native languages were spoken by Hamtramck schoolchildren. A motto often associated with the city is &quot;A League of Nations&quot;. Neal Rubin of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; wrote in 2010 that despite the demographic changes, &quot;In a lot of ways, Hamtramck still feels like a Polish enclave.&quot;

In 1987, Detroit television station WDIV ran one episode of a local sit-com called &quot;Hamtramck&quot; which featured former Detroit Tigers pitcher Dave Rozema and a cameo by manager Sparky Anderson. It was met with poor reviews and protests by many Polish Americans, and was canceled before airing a second episode.

After six decades of double-digit percentage declines in population between 1930 and 1990, Hamtramck finally started to grow in recent years, with population blossoming almost 55% by the 2020 census, surpassing 28,000 residents. These large population gains were despite a small decrease in households in the past 40 years.

The Hamtramck Historical Museum and the Polish Art Center are next door to one another.

In 1997, the &quot;Utne Reader&quot; named Hamtramck one of &quot;the 15 hippest neighborhoods in the U.S. and Canada&quot; in part for its punk and alternative music scene, its Buddhist temple, its cultural diversity, and its laid-back blue-collar neighborhoods. In May 2003, Maxim Blender selected Hamtramck as the second &quot;Most Rock N&#x27; Roll City&quot; in the U.S., behind Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York City. Hamtramck is home of several of Michigan&#x27;s most distinguished music venues.

In January 2004, members of the Al-Islah Islamic Center requested permission to use loudspeakers for the purpose of broadcasting the Islamic call to prayer. This request set off a contentious debate in the city, about the noise that would be caused by the call to prayer, eventually garnering national attention. Ultimately Hamtramck amended its noise ordinance in July 2004, allowing for the prayer calls to be made.

Hamtramck Disneyland is an art installation in the city built on two garages out of metal.

===Hamtramck festivals===
====Pączki Day====
Polish immigrants and residents of Hamtramck and southeastern Michigan celebrate Tłusty Wtorek (Fat Tuesday), known locally as Pączki Day, by lining up at the city&#x27;s numerous Polish bakeries to purchase pączki. On Pączki Day, several local bars host parties with live entertainment and free pączki.

====Hamtramck Music Festival====
The &quot;Hamtramck Music Festival&quot; is an annual Independent music festival held in March in Hamtramck. It is currently sponsored by Bens Encore and the local Artist Community. In 2011, almost 200 bands played the Blowout at 14 venues over four days.

====St. Florian Strawberry Festival====

====Pride 365 Launch and Protest====
In response to a decision by the city council to ban pride flags on city flagpoles, multiple LGBT activist groups organized into a coalition.

====Planet Ant Film &amp; Video Festival in Hamtramck====
Held at the Planet Ant Theater, the festival celebrates independent movies and the people who make them, featuring comedies, dramas, documentaries, animation and music videos.

==Economy==
General Motors&#x27; Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant, one of the automaker&#x27;s premiere facilities, produced the Chevrolet Volt, the Cadillac CT6, the Chevrolet Impala and the Buick Lacrosse; it was closed in March 2019, and retooled as Factory ZERO to build the upcoming GMC Hummer EV.

In April 2009, American Axle announced that it planned to close its plant at the Hamtramck/Detroit border, thus eliminating several hundred jobs in the area. As of February 2014, most of the 1.9 million-square-foot former facility has been demolished.

The Polish Art Center, at 9539 Joseph Campau Street, is a local institution in Hamtramck. The center promotes the preservation of Polish heritage through its display of cultural artifacts, often exhibited at festivals, schools and libraries. The center also hosts lectures, book signings, workshops, folk-art demonstrations, and pisanki-making classes.

The Ukrainian American Archives &amp; Museum of Detroit is located at 9630 Joseph Campau Ave. It was formerly at 11756 Charest Street. The Museum&#x27;s purpose is &quot;to educate and inform the general public about the culture, art, and history of Ukrainians, their immigration to the United States and the contributions of Americans of Ukrainian descent to America; to engage in research in these areas; to maintain archives for the deposit of documents and other records relating to these topics; to acquire, preserve, exhibit artifacts of artistic, historical, and scientific value relating to these subjects; to sponsor public programs in order to study and preserve the heritage of Ukrainian Americans.&quot;

For more than 85 years, Kowalski Sausage Co. has manufactured meat products at 2270 Holbrook Street, which are distributed in the metropolitan Detroit area.

Notwithstanding the statement in the credits that it was filmed &quot;in Detroit, Michigan&quot;, the 1998 Indie film &quot;Polish Wedding&quot; was filmed mainly in Hamtramck, particularly at a house on Wyandotte Street. Theresa Connelly, who wrote and directed the film, had spent her childhood in Hamtramck.
In December 2010, citing general budget woes and the city of Detroit withholding a portion of shared revenue for the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant straddling the border of both cities, Hamtramck requested that the State of Michigan allow it to declare bankruptcy. The request was denied. Receivership was avoided when a deal was struck between the city and Detroit which required Detroit to pay $3.2 million in collected taxes to Hamtramck in exchange for Hamtramck paying Detroit nearly the same amount for a water and sewage bill that was in arrears.

The United States Postal Service operates the Hamtramck Post Office at 2933 Caniff Street. The post office annex is located at 14600 Dequindre Street in the City of Detroit.

==Sports==
Hamtramck is home to Detroit City FC (DCFC), a professional American soccer club that plays in United Soccer League Championship (USLC), the second tier of the American Soccer Pyramid. The club plays their home matches at Keyworth Stadium, which is owned by Hamtramck Public Schools. The club, which was mainly managed by Trevor James, who was a former Ipswich Town F.C. player who later was an assistant coach and scout under Bobby Robson, is now managed by Danny Dichio, who was a former Toronto FC player who later was an assistant coach for Sacramento Republic FC, another USLC team.

A Little League team from Hamtramck won the 1959 Little League World Series.

===Ethnic groups===

Historically, Hamtramck received a lot of immigration from Eastern Europe. In the 20th century, Hamtramck was mostly Polish. George Tysh of the &quot;Metro Times&quot; stated that &quot;In the early days of the auto industry, Hamtramck&#x27;s population swelled with Poles, so much so that you were more likely to hear Polish spoken on Joseph Campau than any other tongue.&quot; Later waves of immigration brought Albanians, Bosnians, Macedonians, Ukrainians, and Yemenis. By 2001 many Bangladeshis, Bosnians, and Iraqi Assyrians were moving to Hamtramck. As of 2011 almost one in five Hamtramck residents was Asian (excluding those from South-west Asia). As of 2003, over 30 languages are spoken in Hamtramck and more than four religions are present. The four principal religions are, Islam, Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism.

In June 2013, the city&#x27;s Human Relations Commission facilitated the raising of flags of 18 countries from which Hamtramck residents emigrated. They are displayed on Joseph Campau Street, with an American flag flying at either end.

====Bangladeshi-Bengali people====
In the 1930s, the first group of Bengalis came to Detroit and Hamtramck. The first significant population of Bengalis began arriving in the late 1980s and the Bengalis became a large part of the city&#x27;s population in the 1990s. The largest growth occurred in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2001 many Bangladeshi Americans had moved from New York City, particularly Astoria, Queens, to Hamtramck and the east side of Detroit. Many moved because of lower costs of living, larger amounts of space, work available in small factories, and the large Muslim community in Metro Detroit. Many Bangladeshi Americans moved into Queens, and then onwards to Metro Detroit.

In 2002, over 80% of the Bangladeshi population within Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties lived in Hamtramck and some surrounding neighborhoods in Detroit. That area overall had almost 1,500 ethnic Bangladeshis. Almost 75% of Bangladeshi Michiganders live in Hamtramck.

By 2002, a Bengali business district formed along Conant Avenue and some residents called it &quot;Little Bengal&quot;. The district, along Caniff and Conant streets, included markets, stores, mosques, and bakeries owned by Bangladeshis, Indians, and Pakistanis. By 2008 the Bengali business district, between Davison and Harold Street, and partially within the city limits of Detroit, received the honorary title &quot;Bangladesh Avenue&quot; and was to be dedicated as such on November 8, 2008. Akikul H. Shamin, the president of the Bangladesh Association of Michigan, estimated that Bangladeshi people operate 80% of the buildings and businesses in the portion of Conant Avenue. As of February 2008 the city planned to erect signage reading &quot;Bangladesh Town&quot; in the business district.

In 2002, the estimate of Hamtramck inhabitants of origins from South Asia was from 7,000 to 10,000. As of 2001, 900 registered students who spoke Bengali and Urdu attended Hamtramck Public Schools. Most Bangladeshis in Hamtramck originate from the north-eastern region of Sylhet in Bangladesh; therefore, most speak Sylheti, an Indic language that is often considered as a dialect of Bengali as well.

As of 2014, there are over 13 Bengali clothing shops in the city.

====Yemeni people====
As of 2006, most of the Middle Eastern population in Hamtramck is Yemeni. Hakim Almasmari wrote in 2006 that &quot;Several streets seem to be populated exclusively by Yemeni Americans, and Yemeni culture pervades the city&#x27;s social, business, and political life.&quot; Many Yemeni restaurants are in Hamtramck, and the Yemeni community operates the Mu&#x27;ath bin Jabal Mosque (), which was established in 1976. In 2005 the mosque, located just outside the southeastern border of Hamtramck, was the largest mosque out of the ten within a three-mile radius. Sally Howell, author of &quot;Competing for Muslims: New Strategies for Urban Renewal in Detroit&quot;, wrote that the mosque &quot;has been credited&quot; by public officials and area Muslims &quot;with having turned around one of Detroit&#x27;s roughest neighborhoods at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s, making its streets safe, revitalizing a dormant housing market, attracting new business to the area, and laying the foundation for an ethnically mixed, highly visible Muslim population in Detroit and Hamtramck.&quot;

According to Almasmari, some of the first Yemenis to have arrived in Hamtramck said that Yemeni people first arrived in Hamtramck in the 1960s. The &quot;Building Islam in Detroit: Foundations/Forms/Futures&quot; project of the University of Michigan stated that Yemenis began arriving in the 1970s.

In 2013 Dasic Fernandez, a Chilean artist, created a by mural on the Sheeba restaurant celebrating the Yemeni population. The mural depicts a girl in a veil decorated with the blue sky, a farmer wearing a turban, and a woman in a hijab. The Arab American and Chaldean Council and the coalition OneHamtramck commissioned the mural.

===Religious and political issues===
In the 2000s, a Bengali mosque named the Al-Islah Jamee Masjid asked for permission to broadcast the adhan, the Islamic call to prayer, from loudspeakers outside of the mosque, and requested permission to do so from the city government. It was one of the newer mosques in Hamtramck. Sally Howell, author of &quot;Competing for Muslims: New Strategies for Urban Renewal in Detroit&quot;, wrote that the request &quot;brought to a head simmering Islamophobic sentiments&quot; in Hamtramck. Muslims and interfaith activists supported the mosque. Some anti-Muslim activists, including some from other states including Kentucky and Ohio, participated in the controversy. In 2004, the city council voted unanimously to allow mosques to broadcast the adhan on public streets, making it one of a few U.S. cities to do so. Some individuals had objected to the allowing of the adhan due to noise concerns.

In 2023, the Hamtramck city council approved animal slaughtering in households for Muslim religious purposes.

On June 13, 2023, the city council introduced a resolution prohibiting the display on city property of all flags but the American flag and “nations’ flags that represent the international character of [the] City,” which many interpreted as an indirectly targeted ban of the rainbow flag on city property and sidewalks, which had previously been the source of controversy among some residents. Following three hours of public comment, the council passed the resolution unanimously. Mayor Amer Ghalib opposed displaying the pride flag, but former mayor Karen Majewski had supported displaying it. The council also voted to remove two commissioners of the Hamtramck Human Rights Commissioner for flying the rainbow flag. The move was criticized by senator Stephanie Chang, U.S. representatives Shri Thanedar and Rashida Tlaib, and Detroit mayor Mike Duggan.

In response to a decision by the city council, multiple activist groups organized into a coalition opposing the flag restrictions. The founding group consisted of individual activists, AntiTransphobe Detroit, Michigan General Defense Committee, and the Hamtramck Queer Alliance. Notable speakers at the event were Dana Nessel, Rev. Strickland, Grace of AtA, and Josh of HQA.

==Government==

Hamtramck is governed under a council-manager form of government in which the elected mayor of the city is the chief executive officer. The city council consists of six seats. Though part of the council, the mayor is elected separately and votes only in the case of a tie and on ordinances and contracts. The city council hires a city manager, who becomes the city&#x27;s chief administrative officer. The city manager has the vested powers and responsibility to appoint and remove all city employees and department heads, prepare the city&#x27;s budget, and other city functions.

The current Hamtramck City Hall is a former hospital building. In 1927, the Hamtramck Municipal Hospital, housed in a Georgian Revival building, opened. The mayor of Hamtramck asked the Sisters of Saint Francis to operate the hospital. In 1931, the religious order began leasing the hospital from the city government for $1 per year. The hospital was renamed the Saint Francis Hospital. During its lifetime it offered services to Polish speakers. In 1969, the hospital closed and the building became the city&#x27;s city hall.

In November 2015, Hamtramck became the first American city to elect a Muslim-majority city council. In 2022, it became the first American city to have an all-Muslim government. It also now has an all male elected government which has been said to &quot;not reflect the city&#x27;s makeup.&quot; The Wayne County Jail Division operates the William Dickerson Detention Facility in Hamtramck. The city levies a city income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents.

==Education==
===Public schools===
Hamtramck is served by Hamtramck Public Schools. Hamtramck High School is the public high school of Hamtramck. In addition Hanley International Academy, Frontier International Academy, Hamtramck Academy, Bridge Academy (of the Global Educational Excellence (GEE) company), Caniff Liberty Academy and Oakland International Academy are all charter schools, in Hamtramck. Frontier International Academy, a charter school operated by GEE, is in nearby Detroit.

===Private schools===
Hamtramck was historically a Polish Catholic community, so it housed Catholic schools by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. One of the buildings once used by Hanley charter school was previously St. Florian Elementary School. The other Catholic primary schools included Our Lady Queen of Apostles and St. Ladislaus Elementary School. The city also housed St. Florian High School, a Catholic high school which opened in 1940 and was located in another wing of the same building as St. Florian.

The parishes that established St. Florian, Our Lady Queen of Apostles, and St. Ladislaus had been built after 1909. In 1925 2,217 students attended St. Florian, making it the largest Catholic elementary school in the city. That year, St. Ladislaus had 1,540 students, and Our Lady Queen of Apostles had 1,316 students. JoEllen McNergney Vinyard, author of &quot;For Faith and Fortune: The Education of Catholic Immigrants in Detroit, 1805-1925&quot;, wrote that the classrooms were &quot;more crowded than most any Polish parish school in Detroit.&quot; In the Catholic schools in Hamtramck there were often 70 students per classroom compared to 45 students per classroom in Hamtramck public schools. It was common for children to attend religious schools selectively during certain periods so they could absorb religious ideals, but go to public school for preschool and later stages. In the 1920s Hamtramck had no Catholic high school and the majority of parents sent their children to public high school. Felician Academy and St. Josephat&#x27;s Polish Catholic High School, two schools in Detroit, were located several blocks away from the Hamtramck border. Some parents sent their children to those schools.

In 1992 Dickinson West Elementary School opened in the former St. Ladislaus building. In the fall of 2002, St. Florian High and Bishop Gallagher High School in Harper Woods merged to form Trinity Catholic High School in Harper Woods. At that point, St. Florian Elementary remained open. In 2005 the archdiocese announced that St. Florian Elementary would close. After St. Florian Elementary&#x27;s closing, no Catholic schools are located within the city limits of Hamtramck. During the same year, the archdiocese announced that Trinity High School would close.

===History of education===

In the 1920s Hamtramck families often sent their children to public school for kindergarten due to convenience, then moved their children to parochial schools for the years with the most important religious instruction. Therefore, the age group 7 to 12 had the largest Catholic school enrollment. After the critical period ended, many students returned to public school. In 1925 the public schools had 1,467 students aged 14–15 while the non-public schools had 217 students aged 14 and 15. In the early 1920s the annual growth rate of Hamtramck Public Schools buildings were 27% while non-public schools had an annual growth rate of 6% in that period.

In the 1920s there was a high level of school dropout in Hamtramck. During the decade Hamtramck had three 12th-grade students per 100 5th-grade students while the City of Detroit had 21 12th-grade students per 100 5th-grade students. In the 1920s 58% of 16-year-olds and 85% of 17-year-olds in Hamtramck were no longer attending high school. One public school survey stated that in 1924-1925 65% of male school dropouts began working in factories.

===Public libraries===

Hamtramck Public Library Albert J. Zak Memorial is located at 2360 Caniff. The Tau Beta Association founded the library in November 1918. The library opened at its second location, the second floor of a professional building, on November 14, 1938. In 1951 the City Hall branch opened in the first floor of the municipal building; it was dedicated on January 22, 1952. The current library received its groundbreaking ceremony on July 5, 1955. It was completed on May 31, 1956, and dedicated on July 1, 1956.

<text>Highland Park is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An enclave of Detroit, Highland Park is located roughly north of Downtown Detroit, and is surrounded by Detroit on most sides. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 8,977.

==History==
The area that became Highland Park began as a small farming community, on a large ridge at what is now Woodward Avenue and Highland, north of Detroit. In 1818, prominent Detroit judge Augustus B. Woodward bought the ridge, and platted the village of Woodwardville in 1825. The development of the village failed. Another Detroit judge, Benjamin F. H. Witherell, son of Michigan Supreme Court justice James Witherell, attempted to found a village platted as Cassandra on this site in 1836, but this plan also failed.

By 1860, the settlement was given a post office under the name of Whitewood. After a succession of closures and reopenings of the rural post office, the settlement was finally incorporated as a village within Greenfield Township and Hamtramck Township under the name of Highland Park in 1889.
In 1907, Henry Ford purchased just north of Manchester Street between Woodward Avenue and Oakland Street to build an automobile plant. Construction of the Highland Park Ford Plant was completed in 1909, and the area&#x27;s population dramatically increased in 1913, when Henry Ford opened the plant&#x27;s first assembly line. The village of Highland Park was incorporated as a city in 1918 to protect its tax base, including its successful Ford plant, from Detroit&#x27;s expanding boundaries.

In 1910, Highland Park, then a village, had 4,120 residents. Between 1910 and 1920 during the boom associated with the automobile industry, Highland Park&#x27;s population grew to about 46,500, an increase of 1,081 percent, reaching its peak around 1927. The growth of Highland Park and neighboring Hamtramck broke records for increases of population; both municipalities withstood annexation efforts from Detroit. In 1925, Chrysler Corporation was founded in Highland Park. It purchased the city&#x27;s Brush-Maxwell plant, which would eventually expand to 150 acres and serve as the site of the company&#x27;s headquarters for the next 70 years.

Arthur Lupp of Highland Park founded the Michigan branch of the Black Legion in 1931; it was a secret vigilante group related to the Ku Klux Klan, which had been prominent in Detroit in the 1920s. The Legion had a similar nativist bent and its members were opposed to immigrants, Catholics, Jews, blacks, labor organizers, etc. Many public and business officials of Highland Park, including the chief of police, a mayor, and a city councilman, joined this group. Lupp and others were among the 48 men indicted and convicted following the murder of Charles Poole in May 1936; eleven were convicted in that murder. Investigations revealed the Legion had been involved in many other murders or conspiracies to murder during the previous three years, for which another 37 men were convicted. These convictions ended the reign of the Legion.

In 1944, the Davison Freeway was opened as the country&#x27;s first modern depressed urban freeway, running through the center of the city. It was completely reconstructed and widened in 1996 and 1997 to improve its safety.

Ford Motor Company demolished large sections of its Highland Park plant in the late 1950s. With the loss of industrial jobs, the city suffered many of the same difficulties as Detroit: declines in population and tax base accompanied by an increase in street crime. White flight from the city accelerated after the 1967 Detroit 12th Street Riot. Ford&#x27;s last operation at the factory, the production of tractors at its Model T plant, was discontinued in 1973, and in 1981 the entire property was sold to a private developer for general industrial usage. The city population was majority black and impoverished by the 1980s. Chrysler, the city&#x27;s last major private sector employer, moved its corporate headquarters from Highland Park to Auburn Hills between 1991 and 1993, paying the city $44 million in compensation. The move dislocated a total of 6,000 jobs over this period.

On June 19, 1982, drafter Vincent Chin was beaten to death in Highland Park by two automotive workers in retaliation for Japan&#x27;s success in the automotive industry. The killing was considered a racially-motivated hate crime.

Known as &quot;The City of Trees&quot;, the town was thickly forested until the 1970s. The spread of Dutch elm disease required many old trees to be cut down.

From 2001 to 2009, the city was controlled by an emergency financial manager appointed by the State of Michigan due to mounting financial stress.

In August 2011, more than two-thirds of the street lights in Highland Park&#x27;s residential neighborhoods and alleys were removed by the city, due to an inability to pay a $60,000 per month electric bill. The street lights were not only turned off, but decommissioned, or removed from their posts. The city advised residents to keep porch lights on to deter crime. The following year, a local 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, Soulardarity, was formed to restore streetlighting to the city&#x27;s residential neighborhoods and alleyways in the form of solar street lights.

On November 20, 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department filed a lawsuit against the City of Highland Park regarding unpaid sewage services and water totaling $17.7 million. In 2020, the two cities settled out of court for an unspecified amount.

==Government and infrastructure==

===Municipal services===
Highland Park is governed under the council-mayor form of government. The mayor is the executive and administrative head of the city, and appoints city officers such as the city clerk, city treasurer, city attorney, and finance director as well as other department heads. The city council consists of five members, two members who are elected at large and three who are elected from the city&#x27;s three electoral districts. The at-large member who receives the most votes becomes council president for that term. The mayor and city council members are limited to four consecutive four-year terms in office, though are eligible to run for office again one year after the conclusion of their fourth consecutive term. The city levies an income tax of 2 percent on residents and 1 percent on nonresidents.

However, using the Public Act 72 of 1990, Governor John Engler appointed an emergency financial manager to take over the city&#x27;s financial operations in December 2000, effectively relegating the mayor, city council, and other elected public officers to advisory roles. Ramona Henderson-Pearson was appointed the city&#x27;s first emergency financial manager. In 2002, Henderson-Pearson laid off most city workers. She shuttered several city buildings including the McGregor public library and the old Civic Center buildings on Gerald Street. Her successor, Arthur Blackwell, was appointed in 2005 and fired in April 2009 for over-payments that he received. The third and final emergency financial manager, Robert Mason, returned the city to local control in July 2009.

The city administration works out of the Robert B. Blackwell Municipal Building at 12050 Woodward Avenue.

The old Municipal Building at 28‒30 Gerald Street was opened in 1927. Designed by Marcus Burrowes and Frank Eurich, Jr. in the Classical Revival style, it was the final element of the Highland Park Civic Center ensemble located on both sides of Gerald Street near Woodward Avenue. It remains as a monument to the rapidly growing and wealthy Highland Park of the 1910s and 1920s. From 1999 to 2001, it also housed the police department, then fell into disuse. As of 2020, it continues to await redevelopment as part of a wider regeneration of downtown Highland Park by means of a Tax increment financing district, or potential listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

====Police Department====
The Highland Park Police Department was headquartered in a building opened at 25 Gerald Street in 1917. In 1984 the police and fire departments were merged into a Public Safety Department. The former police and then public safety headquarters building was vacated in 1999. All operations moved across the street into the old Municipal Building, which in turn was vacated in 2001 with all functions moving to the Robert Blackwell Municipal Building. In December 2001, the city police department was formally disbanded, at which time the Wayne County Sheriff Department took over policing the city. The Highland Park Police Department was re-established on July 1, 2007.

The police administrative offices are located in the Robert Blackwell Municipal Building, and the patrol station is in a mini-station in the Model-T Plaza strip mall. It has occupied that facility since 2007. The jail facility there is a makeshift chain-link cage. The police department has a business liaison office in the Woodward Place Plaza.

====Fire Department====
The village of Highland Park&#x27;s fire department was established in 1911. It was housed in the first municipal building at 20 Gerald Street, designed by Albert E. Williams and opened in 1911. Given Highland Park&#x27;s rapid growth and industrialization in the 1910s and 1920s, the police and the municipal government moved to purpose-built buildings in 1917 and 1927, respectively. The first municipal building was expanded and altered several times until it became the headquarters of the Highland Park Fire Department (HPFD), established in 1917.

At its peak, the fire department employed about 84 firefighters and had four fire stations across the city. One of them was Engine 4, Ladder 3 at 19–21 Sturtevant Street, near Hamilton Avenue (demolished in 2013).

Highland Park&#x27;s shrinking population and tax base took its toll. In 1984 the police and fire departments were merged into a Public Safety Department. The fire department again became a separate entity in 2005. By that time, the headquarters building on Gerald Street was deemed uninhabitable. The department moved to an old, 40000 sq. ft. warehouse at 12900 Oakland Park Boulevard, near Oakland Avenue and the Davison Freeway at the edge of the city, where it remained until 2013.

A $2.7 million Federal Emergency Management Agency grant made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act enabled construction of a new, purpose-built station. It was built on the site of the old police headquarters, demolished in 2012, at 25 Gerald Street, across the street from the condemned Fire Department headquarters. The new fire station was opened on September 3, 2013.

==Economy==
Chrysler was headquartered in Highland Park. In 1992 the company announced it would move its headquarters to its technology center in Auburn Hills, approximately north of the original headquarters site. The company planned to accomplish the move by 1995. In 1992 Chrysler had 25% of Highland Park&#x27;s tax base and contributed 50% of the city&#x27;s budget. Chrysler had about 5,000 employees in Highland Park when it moved.

In 2009 Magna International announced plans to start an automotive seat production operation in the former Chrysler headquarters. The plant on the site of the former Chrysler headquarters opened in June 2010.

The gear-reduction starter Chrysler used from the early 1960s through the late 1980s garnered the nickname &quot;Highland Park Hummingbird&quot; after Chrysler&#x27;s hometown and the starter&#x27;s distinctive cranking sound.

Despite Chrysler&#x27;s departure, the city remains associated with Chrysler in the minds of auto enthusiasts.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===

Highland Park is served by Highland Park Schools, which was reorganized in 2012 as the Highland Park Public School Academy System, a public school academy district. The academy operates one school, Barber Preparatory Academy, a K-8 school. For high school education, students are zoned to Northwestern High School in the Detroit Public Schools Community District. Highland Park Community High School of Highland Park Schools closed in 2015.

George Washington Carver Academy is a K-8 charter school that was originally authorized by academy. The school&#x27;s 2008 mathematics and English standardized test scores for 4th grade students were invalidated after cheating had been discovered. In 2013 the school participated in the &quot;Students for Peace&quot; competition in order to reduce the amount of fighting on campus; in 2012 91% of the students had received suspensions because they participated in fighting. In 2016 it had 560 students, and it is managed by Midwest Management Group. That year it changed its authorizer to Bay Mills Community College out of concern that the Highland Park school district may collapse.

===Colleges and universities===
Lawrence Technological University was founded in 1932 in Highland Park by the Lawrence brothers as the Lawrence Institute of Technology and adopted its current name in 1989. Lawrence Tech moved to Southfield, Michigan, from its site in Highland Park, Michigan, in 1955.

Highland Park Community College was in Highland Park before its 1996 closing. It had been known as Highland Park Junior College.

===Public library===

In 1918 Katherine and Tracy McGregor, wealthy individuals, deeded the property of a facility for &quot;homeless, crippled, and backward children.&quot; The McGregor Public Library opened on that site in 1924. The library closed in 2002. Around 2007 the city began efforts to re-open the library. However, little action has taken place to re-open the building.

==Parks and recreation==
The Ernest T. Ford Recreation Center serves as a recreation center for the community. The center has a basketball court, exercise equipment, pool tables, table games, and televisions. After a renovation, it re-opened in February 2008.
In 1993 Highland Park Community College won the MCCAA Division 1 Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship against Macomb Community College.

<text>Inkster is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A western suburb of Detroit, Inkster is located about southwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 26,088.

== History ==
The area was originally inhabited by Native Americans. It was settled by non-indigenous people in 1825. A post office named &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was established there in December 1857. Robert Inkster, a Scotsman born March 27, 1828, in Lerwick, Shetland, operated a steam sawmill on present-day Inkster Road near Michigan Avenue in the early 1860s.

The post office was renamed &quot;Inkster&quot; in July 1863. The village had a station on the Michigan Central Railroad by 1878. It incorporated as a village in 1926 from parts of Nankin Township and Dearborn Township. After much legal wrangling by the city of Dearborn, Dearborn Township, and the village of Inkster to sort out final borders for these communities, Inkster was incorporated as a city in 1964.

In the 1920s and 1930s, African-Americans working in Henry Ford&#x27;s Dearborn factories settled in Inkster, as it was closer to their work than Detroit, while they were not allowed to live in Dearborn itself.

As a result of the police beating of Floyd Dent in January 2015, which was caught on a police vehicle&#x27;s dash cam and released to the public, the victim was awarded $1.4 million. A special assessment of Inkster residents will pay for the settlement, on their July 1, 2015, property tax bill.

Portions of the township have also since been annexed to the city. The most recent annexation was property owned by the City of Northville as part of the Rural Hill Cemetery. The entire township is served by the Northville District Library and by its own police and fire departments.

==History==

While the village of Northville developed within the borders of Plymouth Township from the 1820s, Northville Township itself did not exist until 1898. At that time, local residents, allegedly feeling slighted by Plymouth Township officials being more focused on Plymouth Village, decided to split off into a separate township. In this way, the former Plymouth &quot;SuperTownship&quot; (which formerly included all of Canton, Plymouth, and Northville Townships) became split into Plymouth Township and Northville Township.

Northville Township later became a charter township in 1985.

1907 Salem Train Crash

The 1907 Salem Train Crash occurred in what is now Northville Township, approximately a quarter mile east of Napier Road and a quarter mile north of Five Mile Road. 34 individuals lost their lives in the deadliest passenger train crash in Michigan history.

===ZIP code===
In response to the rapid growth of the township, a new 48168 ZIP code was introduced in June 2005 to those living south of Seven Mile Road. Those living on or north of the road (as well as those living in the city of Northville) kept the 48167 zip code, as well as any residents with a 48170 ZIP code (Plymouth).

===2009 budget crisis and proposed public safety layoffs===
In late September 2009, just more than a month after the hospital property purchase, the Northville Township Board of Trustees stated that they were operating with a budget deficit. The Board began the process of asking department heads and directors to find ways to cut their budgets. One of the proposed cuts was the laying off of 5 police officers and 2 public safety dispatchers, roughly a 15-20% reduction in police manpower. The Northville Township police union went door-to-door passing out flyers to educate the public on the board proposed cuts and to invite the public to voice their opinions on the issue to the township Board of Trustees.

On October 1, 2009, Northville Township residents voiced their displeasure over proposed public safety cuts on the 2010 budget. Several of the residents in attendance criticized the Township Board of Trustees for not doing more to maintain the public safety department. Board members came under scrutiny for supporting the August ballot initiative to buy the of the former Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital property, knowing that there was a budget shortfall. Several residents argued that the Board should have asked for a millage to support their current level of service, instead of asking voters to support the land purchase. Township trustees stated that the two issues were unrelated.

On October 15, 2009, a little more than two months after the Psychiatric Hospital property vote, the Northville Township Board of Trustees approved the 2010 fiscal budget. The budget, as approved, authorized the laying off of 5 police officers and 2 public safety dispatchers. The budget also required many of the township&#x27;s non-union employees to take mandatory furlough days. In an attempt to prevent police layoffs, a local lottery winner proposed to give Northville Township the money necessary to make up for the alleged public safety budget deficit, approximately $640,000. The Board of Trustees turned down the offer stating that one of its conditions, the maintenance of current public safety staffing, was not a condition they could legally accept. The Board of Trustees stated that if the police officers’ union were to agree to concessions, then the layoffs would be avoided. Residents continued to publicly voice their displeasure with the Board&#x27;s decision, with some residents even suggesting a possible campaign to recall the members of the township board.

==Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital==

The Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital (NRPH) was located on a large (400+ acres) property on 7 Mile Road on the eastern side of the township. It was built in 1952, closed in 2003, and was demolished from 2018 to 2023.

===2002–2006===
It was announced that the NRPH was to be closed by the Department of Community Health (DCH) on November 18, 2002. By May 2003 all patients had been transferred to a community setting or another state run psychiatric facility. Due to ineffective controls and oversight of the NRPH&#x27;s closing in 2003, and purchasing, receiving, and payment processes, there is still much unused and used equipment left in the buildings that lost all value during storage. The hospital was closed because of several reasons. First, a declining number of patients in the statewide mental health system. Second, a decline in the workforce, resulting from an early retirement rate, caused the hospital to be shut down. At the time of the closing NPH had 536 employees and 239 patients. The property was sold in a May 2005 auction to REI/Schostak (REIS) for $31.5 million.

===2007–2008===
In October 2007, the sale of the property to REIS was closed. REIS planned to develop the property into an $800 million, mixed-use residential, office, and retail development called &#x27;Highwood&#x27;. Due to the fact that Northville Township would only allow a scaled-down version of Highwood, REIS moved employees to the property in mid-October 2007 for security and to vote to annex the property into neighboring Livonia on August 5, 2008, which approved the original plans for Highwood. Northville and Northville Township residents largely opposed the annexation, which was possible without their consent. Only residents of the area being annexed and the city/township trying to annex the area could vote in the annexation. Residents of the Township started an organization known as &#x27;Stop Annexation&#x27;. On August 5, 2008, the residents of the property and Livonia voted against annexation.

===2009===
On August 4, 2009, residents of Northville Township voted to purchase a majority of the property for $23.5 million. REIS will retain to develop into or less of retail. An owner of a house worth $300,000 would see a tax increase of $144 (per year). Using REIS tax dollars, Northville Township will clean the property extensively. The property will become open, natural space with trails.

The main building of the hospital is being demolished by Adamo Demolition but due to higher level of asbestos, the demolition was delayed. However, this was quickly resolved and the buildings were razed without issue on Friday, November 30, 2018.

==Education==
A majority of the township is served by Northville Public Schools. A small portion of the township is served by Plymouth-Canton Community Schools.

Schools within the township from the former district include Moraine, Ridge Wood, Silver Springs, and Winchester elementary schools, as well as Meads Mill Middle School and Northville High School. Additionally, sections of the township are zoned to Hillside Middle School in Northville.

Tanger Elementary of Plymouth-Canton is in the township. The latter school district operates the Plymouth-Canton Educational Park for high school.

<text>Plymouth is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A western suburb of Detroit, Plymouth is located roughly northwest of downtown Detroit, and northeast of Ann Arbor. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 9,370. It is surrounded by, but independent of, Plymouth Township. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. It is located just south of the M-14 highway and west of Interstate 275.

==Culture==
Plymouth has a variety of shops, restaurants, and other cultural activities.
The Plymouth Ice Spectacular, the largest ice carving festival in North America, is held every year in Plymouth in late January. Founded in 1982 by then 25-year-old Scott Lorenz, the weekend-long event draws an average of 500,000 people to Plymouth each year and has helped establish ice carving as a world-class competitive event.

Since 2008, Plymouth has been home to the Green Street Fair, held over a weekend each May. Featuring green-themed exhibitors and activities, the event has become a yearly tradition. In 2011, the event was attended by about 90,000 visitors.

Plymouth&#x27;s &quot;Art in the Park&quot; is an art fair held annually since 1980.

==History==
Plymouth was first settled in 1825, incorporated as a village in 1867, and became a city in 1932.

===Foundation===
In 1825, Luther Lincoln was granted two land patents in what is now Plymouth by the federal government. Lincoln built his place of business, his saw mill, and abode, near the eastern boundary of his land, along the Rouge River. His actual abode and saw mill was always outside the city limits. Another early settler was William Starkweather. William and his wife Keziah brought their firstborn son Albert to the area and built the first home in Plymouth, at what is now the southwest corner of Main Street and Ann Arbor Trail. The first home was a lean-to, and was later replaced by a log cabin, which has since been destroyed.

===Growth===
In 1831, William Starkweather sold his land in downtown Plymouth and in 1831 purchased an parcel of land in what was then called &quot;North Village&quot; (now called &quot;The Historic Old Village&quot;). In 1844, William died and the land in Old Village was then passed to William&#x27;s son, George A Starkweather. George felt that the railroad coming to North Village would give it a commercial advantage over the Kellogg Park area. In the 1860s, he convinced the Detroit and Howell Railroad Company to build through the town. Starkweather was responsible for cutting Oak Street North through his farm in order to reach his new store and the train station. After his death in 1907, Oak Street was renamed Starkweather in his honor.

Notable streets in Plymouth are named after some Starkweather family members, including Blanche (after Blanche Starkweather, daughter of George Starkweather), Karmada (after the grandchildren of George Starkweather – Karl, Max and Davis), Davis – after Davis B Hillmer – youngest grandson of George Starkweather, Starkweather (formerly Oak Street), Amelia (after Lydia Amelia Heywood – Davis - Starkweather) – George Starkweather&#x27;s wife, and Rose – after Rose Hillmer, eldest grand daughter of George Starkweather. Starkweather Elementary School was named after George Anson Starkweather of Plymouth, which was converted to an adult education center.

Daisy Manufacturing Company, now Daisy Outdoor Products, started in 1882 in Plymouth as the Plymouth Iron Windmill Company. In 1886 Plymouth inventor Clarence Hamilton introduced a new idea to the windmill company. It was a combination of metal and wire, vaguely resembling a gun that could fire a lead ball using compressed air. Lewis Cass Hough, then president of the firm, gave it a try and, after his first shot, enthusiastically exclaimed, &quot;Boy, that&#x27;s a daisy!&quot; The name stuck, and the BB gun went into production as a premium item given to farmers when they purchased a windmill. The gun was such a huge success that Plymouth Iron Windmill soon began manufacturing the Daisy BB gun in place of windmills. On January 26, 1895, the company&#x27;s board of directors officially voted to change the name to Daisy Manufacturing Company, Inc.

===Recent history===
Much to the dismay of Plymouth residents, Daisy moved its corporate offices and manufacturing facilities from Plymouth to Rogers, Arkansas in 1958.

In 2003 the former Daisy factory was converted to Daisy Square Condominiums despite being situated next to an active freight rail line. The front wall of the Daisy factory was left standing to be built into the apartment building. The wall has since been demolished.

In 2009 Plymouth Township was named 28th Best Place to Live in the United States by CNN Money Magazine.

<text>Redford Township is a charter township in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Redford borders Detroit to the west, roughly northwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the township had a population of 49,504.

==History==
Springwells Township and Bucklin Township were formally organized and laid out by gubernatorial act on April 12, 1827. Postal regulations prohibiting two post offices having the same name required—when a township was subdivided—unique names to be found. The Bucklin name was extinguished when it was split on October 29, 1829, along what is now Inkster Road into Nankin Township (west half) and Pekin Township (east half), named as a result of a wave of interest in China. In March 1833, Pekin was renamed Redford and the southern half became Dearborn Township on April 1. The name Redford was chosen because natives and colonial European immigrants forded the River Rouge where the river runs through Redford. &quot;Rouge&quot; is French for &quot;red.&quot;

The township used to go all the way to Greenfield Road, but in the 1920s the eastern portions of the township were annexed by Detroit. This annexation ceased
in 1926 when the township was given &quot;charter&quot; status by the Michigan legislature. In 1918 there was a post office named &quot;Five Points&quot; operating between 6 Mile Road and 7 Mile Road along the road of that name.

Redford is the site of Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School, whose hiring practices spurred the 2012 Supreme Court Case &quot;Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&quot;.

==Geography==
Redford Township is a western suburb of Detroit. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all land.

Ashcroft Creek, another branch of the Rouge River, flows for about a half mile in the southeastern corner of the township before entering Detroit&#x27;s Rouge Park, and then into the main branch of the Rouge. Tarabusi Creek of the Bell Branch, another branch of the Rouge River, flows through Western Golf Club and Bell Creek Park.

<text>River Rouge (, ) is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 7,224 at the 2020 census.

The city is named after the River Rouge, which flows along the city&#x27;s northern border and into the Detroit River. The city includes the heavily industrialized Zug Island and also has its own school district, River Rouge School District.

==History==
The small settlement incorporated as a village in 1899 within Ecorse Township. In 1922 as the city of Detroit expressed interest in annexing land in the township, the Village of River Rouge incorporated as a city on April 3 to avoid being annexed. A month later Detroit completed annexation of land in the township immediately to the west of River Rouge.

One of the most important historical associations with River Rouge is its relationship to a Great Lakes freighter, the SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, which sank in 1975 in a fierce storm in Lake Superior, with the loss of all 29 crew. The ship was constructed in 1958 at the Great Lakes Engineering Works in River Rouge and was the largest ship on the lakes at the time.

The city had its peak of population in 1950, when industry was the mainstay of the local economy. Restructuring of heavy industry and movement of jobs offshore have taken a toll of the city; the loss of jobs resulted in loss of population. In 2020 the population is 35% of what it was in 1950. Many workers who had the flexibility to seek jobs in other areas moved away. Outward migration has resulted in a shift in the racial demographics of the city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Of the city&#x27;s land area, consists of the unpopulated Zug Island. The River Rouge forms the northern boundary with the city of Detroit, and the Detroit River forms the eastern boundary of the city. The Mariners Memorial Light is an active lighthouse located within the city along the Detroit River. Built in 2004, it is located within Belanger Park and is the newest constructed lighthouse in the state of Michigan.

River Rouge contains its own post office located at 10455 West Jefferson Avenue. The post office uses the 48218 ZIP Code, which covers most of River Rouge and a small section of the city of Ecorse to the south. Zug Island uses the Detroit 48209 ZIP Code.

<text>Riverview is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 12,486 at the 2010 census.

Riverview is a suburb of Metro Detroit about south of the southern border of Detroit along the Detroit River. Riverview was incorporated as a village within Monguagon Township in 1923 and later incorporated as a city in 1959.

==History==
The August 9, 1812 Battle of Monguagon between Americans and a British-Indian coalition took place in today&#x27;s Riverview. Native Americans were led by the famous Shawnee warrior Tecumseh, who was wounded in the engagement. The Americans gained a tactical victory at Monguagon but suffered a strategic defeat when US forces returned to Detroit after the fight without reopening their supply line to Ohio. Much of the location remains undeveloped in a green area bounded by Pennsylvania Road to the north, Colvin Street to the south, Electric Avenue to the east, and Vreeland Park to the west, which is also part of the battlefield.

In 1950, Riverview only stretched as far west as the western end of Trenton&#x27;s two northern boundaries. The rest of what is today Riverview was still part of the unincorporated Monguagon Township at that point. In the 1950s and 1960s, during the Cold War, the Department of Defense (through the United States Army) operated Nike missile launch site D-54 on the site of what is now Young Patriot&#x27;s Park. The IFC (integrated fire control) site was on the site of what is now Rivergate Nursing Home and Terrace.

It is most notable as the location of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, a major hub for Delta Air Lines.

==History==
The first white settler in Romulus was Samuel Polyne, a French-Canadian, who settled on section 2 in 1826, though he left soon after the township was organized in 1835.

The first settler in the village proper (prior to the 1865 annexation of the whole village and township into one city) was Samuel McMath, who moved from New York state to the area in 1827. He improved land and planned to bring his family to settle there, but he died before he could carry out this plan.

Solomon Whitaker, Charles and Joseph Pulcifer located in the area in 1830, and in 1833, Jenks Pullen and his six sons settled at what became known as &quot;Pullen&#x27;s Corners&quot; (located in section 19 at the intersection of Ozga and Goddard roads, now commonly called &quot;Five Points&quot;). Pullen&#x27;s Corners was platted in 1836. The community later took on the name of the township.

The township of Romulus was set off from a part of Huron Township by an act of the Michigan Territorial Council on March 17, 1835, and the first township meeting was held on April 16, 1835, two years before the State of Michigan was admitted in to the Union (1837), in the house of Joseph T. Pullen. The first supervisor was David J. Pullen. The township&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Wayne&quot; on March 19, 1845, but was changed back to Romulus on January 16, 1848.

Romulus incorporated as a city in 1970.

<text>Southgate is a city in Wayne County, Michigan, United States. The population was 30,047 at the 2020 census. Southgate was incorporated as a city on October 8, 1958, which was one of the last remaining portions of the now-defunct Ecorse Township. It is part of the Downriver collection of communities south of the city of Detroit.

==History==
Pierre Michel Campau was the first white settler in Southgate. He moved into the area in 1795, which subsequently became a farming community. Other people from the Detroit area at the Rouge and Detroit Rivers followed him to Southgate.

Historically a rural area of Ecorse Township, the areas within present-day Southgate were originally platted with street grids beginning in the 1920s - though most developments only started just after World War II. Among the oldest residential areas in the city is the Old Homestead neighborhood, on the east side.

There are two accounts of the city&#x27;s name: Southgate is described in local guides as the &quot;South Gate&quot; or entrance to the Metro Detroit area. &quot;A metropolitan daily picture story&quot; in late 1956 also explained this.

Southgate&#x27;s first mayor, Thomas J. Anderson, also stated in 1956 that the name originated from the newly built Southgate Shopping Center at the southeast corner of Eureka &amp; Trenton roads. &quot;We were trying to get a separate post office for our community, and were advised that it would help our cause if the township board passed a resolution creating an unincorporated village,&quot; Anderson explained. &quot;The name Southgate was chosen because of the shopping center then under consideration, and the board agreed that it was an appropriate name. Anderson had previously suggested the city be named Southgate due to its location south of Detroit. Anderson became aware of South Gate, California near Los Angeles during World War II while temporarily stationed in San Diego. The resolution was adopted at a regular meeting in the early summer of 1953.&quot;

Thomas Anderson became the first mayor in 1958 after being Ecorse Township&#x27;s supervisor for the previous five years. Southgate Anderson High School was named after him in 1982. The flag for Southgate Michigan which was created in 1973.

<text>Taylor is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Its population was 63,409 at the 2020 census. Taylor is the fifth most-populated city in Wayne County and the 17th most-populated city in Michigan.

The area was originally a civil township known as Taylor Township, which was organized in 1848 and later incorporated as the city of Taylor in 1968. Taylor is the most-populated municipality of the Downriver community, and it is located about west of the southern border of Detroit and about southwest of Downtown Detroit.

Taylor is home to the Southland Center, Taylor Sportsplex, Beaumont Hospital – Taylor, the Downriver Campus of the Wayne County Community College District, and is the founding location of Hungry Howie&#x27;s Pizza. The city was also home to the now-demolished Gibraltar Trade Center. Heritage Park is located within the city and hosts the Junior League World Series, which invites youth baseball players from all over the world for an annual tournament in August. The city is served by the Taylor School District.

==History==
===Predecessor===
The city of Taylor traces its origins back to when it was originally part of Ecorse Township to the west. At this time the land was mostly rural farm land with little development.

The first landowner in the area was Peter Coan, who purchased an parcel from the US government in 1830. The Coan family name continues through the existence of the artificial Coan Lake in Heritage Park, which was named in his honor.

===Township===
Many residents in the western portion of the township found that they lived too far away to participate in the civic affairs and functions of the township. Because of this, the residents petitioned to form a separate community. The petition was granted in 1847 and the new community was named Taylor Township. The township was named after Major General Zachary Taylor, a hero of the Mexican–American War who would go on to serve as the twelfth president of the United States.

A small train station was built in 1876 after the Wabash Railroad built a railroad line through Taylor Township. George E Hand sold the right-of-way through his land and the station was named after him. The area to some locals became known as &quot;Hand Corners&quot;. The original station was destroyed in a fire in 1965 however a near replica was built at Heritage Park.

In 1882, German settlers in Taylor built the West Mound United Methodist Church on Eureka Road. The church sat located on Eureka Road until 1994 when it was sold to the city and relocated to Heritage Park. The church had a major fire in 2020 while construction work was being done.

In 1954, the first American Bektashi Sufi lodge with significant support from the Albanian-American community of the Detroit area.

===City formation and incorporation=== 
On November 8, 1966, citizens voted in favor of the township becoming the City of Taylor, however the city would not be officially incorporated until March 6, 1968, when the city&#x27;s charter was officially approved by then governor George W. Romney a few years after the city&#x27;s founding.

President Bill Clinton attended the commemoration ceremony for the new Department of Public works building grand opening in 1996.

During the middle of 2005 in preparation for Super Bowl XL in Detroit the following year, a large blue bridge was built at the intersection of Telegraph Road and I-94. It is known as the Gateway Bridge and was claimed to be Detroit&#x27;s &quot;new icon&quot; by STRUCTURE Magazine in 2006.

President Barack Obama visited the city while campaigning in 2008.

Corporal Matthew Edwards with the Taylor Police Department died from a fatal gunshot wound after responding to a burglary in an apartment complex in mid-2010. Edwards funeral saw participation from many local and federal law enforcement agencies during the procession.
In 2019, the FBI began a federal investigation of then Mayor Rick Sollars and the City of Taylor for corruption. The FBI raided the City Hall along with the then mayor&#x27;s residence. The former mayor and city are currently still under investigation. At least one city official has pleaded guilty to bribery, as well as a local party store owner, and a local real estate developer as a result of the investigation.

<doc id="119281" wikidata="Q547676" url="?curid=119281" title="Trenton, Michigan">
<text>Trenton is a city in Wayne County, Michigan, United States. At the 2010 census, the city population was 18,853.

A Shawnee village was built in the area by war chief Blue Jacket after the 1795 Treaty of Greenville. The area later became the site of the Battle of Monguagon between Americans and a British-Indian coalition during the War of 1812. The battle is commemorated with a Michigan State Historical Site marker in present-day Elizabeth Park, which was the first county park in Michigan when it was established in 1919. Portions of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge are within the southern portion of Trenton.

The area was once part of the now-defunct Monguagon Township. Trenton was incorporated as a village in 1855 and again as a city in 1957. The city is part of the Downriver collection of communities south of Detroit on the west bank of the Detroit River. Trenton is known for its waterfront and growing boating community. Major industries include Stellantis-Chrysler&#x27;s Trenton Engine Plant, Solutia, and the DTE Energy Trenton Channel Power Plant. Beaumont Hospital – Trenton is located within city limits and has 203 beds. The former McLouth Steel plant is also located in the city. The city operates the Trenton Veterans Memorial Library and a historical museum.

==History==
The founder of Trenton is considered to be Abram Caleb Truax, a member of the territorial militia in attendance when General William Hull surrendered Detroit to the British General Isaac Brock early in the War of 1812. After the war, in 1816, Truax acquired a large tract of land in the Michigan Territory along the Detroit River from the U.S. government and constructed a sawmill, church and store in what is today downtown Trenton. When Territorial Governor Lewis Cass organized Monguagon Township in 1827, Truax became the first township supervisor. He laid out the village of Truaxton in 1834. A post office had been established there named &quot;Monguago&quot; in 1828 with Truax as the first postmaster. The post office name was changed to &quot;Truago&quot; in 1837, and to &quot;Trenton&quot; in 1847, after a type of limestone mined from a local quarry. The village was platted and recorded under the name Trenton in 1850 by Abram Truax&#x27;s son and daughter George Brigham Truax and Sophia Slocum, the wife of industrialist Giles Slocum. The Slocum family estate was given to the county, becoming what is known as Elizabeth Park, named after Elizabeth Slocum.

In 1834 an industrialist, Giles Bryan Slocum, constructed a dock, making Trenton a major hub of steamboat traffic. In 1846, Captain Arthur Edwards founded the Detroit &amp; Cleveland Steamboat Company in Trenton. Through the late 1880s Trenton, like several Downriver communities, was known for its extensive shipyards. Sibley, Michigan would not be incorporated into Trenton until 1929.

Trenton was incorporated as a village in 1855.

A Detroit businessman and later Michigan&#x27;s first U.S. attorney, Solomon Sibley, started a limestone quarry near Trenton, near what is today Fort Street and Sibley Road. Materials from the quarry were used to construct structures in Detroit, most notably Fort Detroit along the Detroit River. The quarry was later sold to Austin Church, who used limestone to make baking soda, which he sold under his family&#x27;s nameplate, Arm &amp; Hammer. In 1900 the quarry was the site of the Sibley Quarry explosion.

Through the late 1880s and even early 1900s, Trenton prospered because it was roughly a day&#x27;s journey between Detroit and Monroe, Michigan, which meant people traveling between the two cities would have to stop overnight in Trenton. Painted center lines, an innovation vital to the traffic control of modern road transport, were first implemented in 1911 by legendary road developer Edward N. Hines on River Road (modern West Jefferson Avenue).

Trenton annexed the village of Sibley (along the modern Riverview border) in 1929, extending the city&#x27;s northern boundary to modern-day Sibley Road. Trenton was incorporated as a city in 1957. In 1920 a small light railroad ran along West Jefferson to Wyandotte. The rail services ended in 1934. The tracks were removed in 1942 for the war effort.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is located between Detroit and Monroe, Michigan, in the southeastern part of the state. The city is located on the western bank of the Detroit River and is bounded by Grosse Ile to the east, Gibraltar to the south, Riverview to the north, Brownstown Township to the west and south and Woodhaven to the west.

===Trenton Channel Power Plant===

The Trenton Channel Power Plant, a coal-burning power station in Trenton, opened on the shoreline of Detroit River in 1924, on the south side of Slocum Island. It is owned by Detroit Edison, a subsidiary of DTE Energy. It had 6 turbine generators with 13 coal-fired boilers when first commissioned. Each unit produced a rated 50 megawatts of electricity. Five short smoke stacks exhausted gases from the boilers. These were the first Detroit Edison units to use pulverized coal rather than the older style stoker-fired beds of coal. They were also the first power plants in the US to use electrostatic precipitators to capture fly ash from the stacks. Electrostatic precipitators, however, were in use in other industries at the time. In 1950, a second plant started up at the same site and adjoined the first plant. It had two turbine generators, #7 and #8, with a rating of 120 megawatts each. Two short smoke stacks released gases from the four boilers. Finally in 1968, Unit #9 was placed in service. It is a 550-megawatt turbine generator fed by a single boiler. It adjoins the high side plant and is located on the south side. One 563-foot-tall smoke stack is used for this unit. Soon afterwards, another stack, identical to the #9 stack, was erected to replace the two short stacks on the high side plant. Both tall stacks remain in service as of 2012.

The characteristic striped smokestacks were constructed with an innovative “smokestack within a smokestack” design to reduce the level of pollutants released. The inner smokestacks were lined with asbestos to achieve this, which ended up later being removed at great cost. The plant strives to keep its area pollutant-free. In 2002, the facility was designated a corporate wildlife habitat by the Wildlife Habitat Council. Because of their efforts, the Trenton Channel Power Plant and Sibley Quarry were co-awarded the Wildlife Habitat Council&#x27;s Corporate Habitat of the Year award in 2004.

By the mid-1970s, the low side plant was decommissioned and the boiler house was eventually demolished. In the 2010s, all generators except #9 were closed. The power plant is scheduled to close by 2023, because DTE Energy is planning to change to natural gas and renewable energy power plants.

===McLouth Steel Trenton Plant===

In 1948, McLouth Steel purchased riverfront land along Jefferson Avenue to begin building its second complex. Between the land purchase and the buildout, the project cost more than $100 million and by 1949, the first ingots were poured at the site. By 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill.

McLouth, the ninth largest steelmaker in the United States, was known both by the industry and its own slogan as a pioneer. It was the first in the United States to use the basic oxygen process, the first to have online computer control of steelmaking processes, the first to use a continuous caster in the United States, the first to cast 100% of its steel by continuous caster, and the first to use inductive slab heating.

Due to a high dependence on automotive customers, outdated and incorrectly sized equipment, union-management struggles, and economic downturns, McLouth underwent multiple bankruptcies and reorganizations in the 1980s and 1990s. McLouth ultimately shuttered for good in 1996, and with it, the Trenton Plant.

The plant was sold later that year to the Detroit Steel Company. Through the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. The plant&#x27;s many failed startup attempts led to Wayne County&#x27;s 2017 foreclosure on the site, after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes. MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing its port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways. The site was put on EPA&#x27;s Superfund National Priorities List in May 2019.

Demolition and cleanup is currently being led by Crown Enterprises and overseen by the EPA and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE). All buildings are scheduled to be demolished by December 2020.

===Beaumont Hospital===
Seaway Hospital, now called Beaumont Hospital, opened up on Fort Street in 1961 as a community hospital in Trenton. Specialties there include diabetes and endocrinology, gastroenterology and GI surgery, geriatrics, nephrology, neurology and neurosurgery, orthopedics, pulmonology and urology.

===Trenton Engine Plant===
The Trenton Engine Plant is a Chrysler factory in Trenton, Michigan. The north factory opened in 1952 and underwent major expansion in 1969. Trenton Engine was the site chosen for production of the 2.2 L four-cylinder engine which debuted in 1980 in the K-cars. In 1985, the north factory underwent another expansion, and later in 2005, Daimler Chrysler reportedly invested $297 million in order to expand the Trenton Engine plant to prepare to build a new 4.0 L version of the SOHC V6 and to also revitalize the 3.8 line. The north factory stopped manufacturing engines in May 2011, and Chrysler announced that it would invest $114 million to repurpose one-fifth or nearly 400,000 square feet of the plant for the production of core components for the Pentastar V-6 engine. In November 2012, the company announced that it would invest an additional $40 million to add a flexible production line that can run both the Pentastar engine and the Tigershark (I-4) engine.

The south factory opened in 2010. Its current product is the 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine, and the 2.0L FCA Global Medium Engine L4 engine.

==Education==
Trenton has four public schools with more than 3,000 students total.

St. Joseph Catholic School in Trenton opened in February 1948, with the school renovated in 1999.

===Defunct school===
Slocum Truax Junior High School was a former junior high school that resided in the present-day Slocum Truax Park in a neighborhood nearby downtown Trenton, which ended up closing in July 1979. In October 1980, the city of Trenton made an attempt to auction off the building and property, but the auction was canceled after the rear of the building was broken into and vandalized, according to the Trenton Times newspaper. The headstone of the building was nearly destroyed when the building was demolished in October 1980, but an effort by then-councilman William Muddiman rescued the piece from utter destruction, according to the Trenton Times. The headstone with the school&#x27;s name that once hung above the entrance of the school currently rests at the front of the Slocum Truax Park. It is the last remaining piece of the former school.

Former elementary schools included Strohm School (1937-1980s), Owen School (1950s-1980s), Foley School (1950s-1980s), and Taylor School (1968-1980s).

==History==
In 1800, settler Henry Snow came and settled on what is now the border with Ypsilanti Township, Washtenaw County which was originally called Snow&#x27;s Landing.

A settlement of the Huron River received a post office on May 7, 1834, with the name of West Huron and postmaster Scott Vining. The township was formed by the State in 1835 and was soon renamed for Martin Van Buren, then vice president of the US. The post office name was also changed. On November 14, 1838, the Van Buren post office was moved to Rawsonville and assumed that name. On October 25, 1895, the Rawsonville post office was closed, only to reopen on November 20, 1895, and to close again on February 28, 1902.

In 1925, the French Landing Dam and Powerhouse was put in place on the Huron River, placing most of the Rawsonville village under water of the new Belleville Lake.

The only visual sign of the historic community is a historical marker at the intersection Rawsonville and Grove Road.

<text>Wayne is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A western suburb of Detroit, Wayne is located about southwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 17,713.

Wayne has a long history of automotive and transportation related manufacturing. Ford Motor Company currently has two plants in Wayne: Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly and the Michigan Assembly Plant, formerly known as the Michigan Truck Plant.

==History==
The site of Wayne was crossed by the Sauk Trail, and due to this, the area was visited by Potawatomi and French fur traders for years before permanent settlement. The first settler was George M. Johnson, who built a small log cabin on 80 acres of land in 1824 (a state historical marker can now be found at the site). The cabin served as a tavern for travelers along the trail, by then known as the Chicago Road. The area soon became known as Johnson&#x27;s Tavern. After a few years, the tavern was sold to Stephen G. Simmons, who continued to operate the business until he murdered his wife while in a drunken rage. Simmons was arrested and taken to Detroit, where he was tried and hanged September 24, 1830. He became the last person to be executed in Michigan, as the territory abolished capital punishment shortly thereafter.

In 1832, Ezra Derby bought the tavern and land from the Simmons heirs and began establishing a settlement. Derby built a sawmill, store, mill, blacksmith shop and the first frame dwelling for himself. In 1834, a plat was recorded in Detroit with lots and a town square under the name Derby&#x27;s Corners. In 1836, the name of the settlement was changed to Wayne, in honor of Revolutionary War General Anthony Wayne. Soon a small hamlet began to develop, which was accelerated by the arrival of the Michigan Central Railroad in 1838. The Chicago Road that ran through Wayne was paved with oak logs in 1850, becoming the Detroit and Saline Plank Road. In 1867 it was changed to its current name of Michigan Avenue. In 1869, Wayne was incorporated as a village with a population of about 800 people. (In 1960 Wayne officially became a city.)

Many major industries have located in the village over the years. The Prouty and Glass Carriage Factory was the first, moving from Detroit in 1888. At the time, this made Wayne the largest carriage and sleigh producer in the country. In 1899, the Detroit interurban railroad (a streetcar system connecting Detroit to outlying towns) reached Wayne and ran until 1929. Ray Harroun, winner of the first Indianapolis 500, built the Harroun motor car in Wayne from 1916 to 1921. The Gotfredson Truck was produced from 1924 to 1927, and The Graham-Paige car company made vehicles in Wayne from 1928 to 1936. Stinson Aircraft was also located at the nearby Detroit Industrial Airport and produced small planes from 1926 to 1948. The Michigan Assembly Plant was built in 1957, and the Gar-Wood company built garbage trucks and hydraulic equipment from 1947 to 1972. Other major companies located in Wayne include Unistrut, which was invented in Wayne, and Wayne Industries.

The population and industrial production around Wayne significantly increased after World War II.

The 1960s saw a period of urban renewal in downtown Wayne, as the city sought to compete with its neighbors. Michigan Avenue had gone from a divided highway to a two-way undivided route between Pershing and 4th Streets, with Main Street to the south serving as an unofficial business route connecting to Michigan Avenue at both ends. As part of the redevelopment of the downtown area, Michigan Avenue received new eastbound lanes, routed one block south of Main Street along Norris Street, with the original undivided route retaining westbound traffic. Wayne Road was subsequently reconstructed to eliminate its original staggered intersection at the now-westbound Michigan Avenue, continuing along the former Washington Street alignment before turning 45 degrees to cross the new eastbound Michigan. Main Street&#x27;s connections to Michigan Avenue were cut off, with the street now only running from Williams Street to Wayne Road, with a segment incorporated into the parking lot of the Town Square Plaza shopping center. The redevelopment ultimately did not result in the kind of growth the city had hoped for, though; in particular, the undersized Town Square Plaza could not compete with the larger Westland Shopping Center a few miles north.

==Geography==
The city, located on the Lower River Rouge which bisects the city, is bound on the north by Glenwood Road, the west by Hannan Road, the south by Van Born Road, and on the east by Merriman Road.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Westland is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A western suburb of Detroit, Westland is located about west of downtown Detroit. As of 2022, the city had a population of 84,037.

==History==
===Early history===


During the 18th century, the area was inhabited by the people of a Potawatomi Native American village. Other tribes, particularly three Algonquian tribes, used the area as hunting territory. Though white settlers did not begin to settle the area until about 1824, they began passing through at the beginning of the 19th century.

Before becoming Westland, the area had several other names. In 1827, the area became known as Bucklin Township, which included what is now the cities of Westland, Livonia, Garden City, Inkster, Wayne, Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Redford Township. In 1829, it was proposed that Bucklin Township be divided into Lima and Richland; the former is what eventually became Westland. Due to name conflicts under territorial law prohibiting duplication of post office names, Lima was renamed Nankin Township, after the Chinese city of Nanking.

===Later history===
Nankin Township was mostly rural until World War II. The Norwayne subdivision is one of the oldest areas of the city, having existed for over 65 years. The area was built immediately after World War II to provide temporary housing for returning soldiers who worked in nearby factories.

By 1960, Nankin Township&#x27;s population had increased to 70,000, giving the area the distinction of being the state&#x27;s largest township. During the early 1960s, the city of Livonia wanted to annex the part of Nankin in which a large shopping mall, Westland Shopping Center, was to be built. The shopping center eventually opened in 1965, joining Northland and Eastland malls in Southfield and Harper Woods, respectively. In reaction to Livonia&#x27;s annexation attempts, the people of Nankin Township voted on May 16, 1966, to take all other territory to form the City Of Westland. At that time, it was the fourth largest city in Wayne County.

==Politics==

The current mayor of Westland is Kevin Coleman. The legislative body of Westland is the City Council, which contains seven members. The current president of the city council is Mike McDermott. Other council members are Council President Pro-Tem Melissa Sampey, Peter Herzberg, Emily Bauman, James Hart, Andrea Rutkowski, and 1 vacant seat (to be appointed March 2024).

==Education==
Westland and the city of Wayne form the Wayne-Westland Community School District. There are four high schools, John Glenn, Wayne Westland Community High School (formerly Tinkham Alternative Education), and William D. Ford Career Technical Center in Westland, and Wayne Memorial in Wayne. There is a historical site, Perrinsville School in Westland on Warren Road. Nearly all students that live in the city of Wayne go to Wayne Memorial High School, along with some residents of Van Buren Township, Inkster, Romulus, Canton and southern Westland. Students in central Westland and portions of northern Westland, as well as isolated areas of neighboring Inkster and Canton, attend John Glenn High School. The northernmost portions of Westland are in the Livonia Public Schools district.

Portions of Westland that had been in the Taylor School District prior to the 2013 dissolution of the Inkster School District are assigned to Taylor Parks Elementary School, Hoover Middle School, and Harry S. Truman High School in Taylor.

<text>Aitkin ( ) is a city and the county seat of Aitkin County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 2,168 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Before the establishment of City of Aitkin, a transient community of Lexington was located at the mouth of the Ripple River, at its confluence with the Mississippi River. However, maps from the 1860s erroneously depict the village of Ojibway at the mouth of the Ripple River.

Due to the importance of regional trade at Lexington, the route of the Northern Pacific Railroad was planned to pass near there. Aitkin was founded in 1870 when the Northern Pacific Railroad was extended to that point, replacing and annexing Lexington. The city and county were named for William Alexander Aitken, a partner of the American Fur Company and chief factor of the company&#x27;s regional operations in the early 19th century.

The development of industries attracted people to the town. In the late 19th and early 20th century, a massive wave of immigrants, mostly from present-day Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavian countries, moved into the Aitkin area to work in the logging and riverboat industries. They were able to start working before they had learned much English.

After the Great Depression and World War II, the logging industry declined. The area developed as a farming community, based on production of cattle and poultry, which continued until the late 1970s to early 1980s. A creamery and a turkey plant were important to the town&#x27;s economy. With the decline of small family farms in agriculture, many abandoned farms can be seen throughout the county.

By the 1990s, Aitkin had changed again, developing as a community for retirement and tourism, especially with its lake areas. The tourism and service industries are central today. Health care, education, human services, and non-profit organizations are some of the major contributors to the modern-day Aitkin economy, along with the hospitality industry.

Aitkin has been affected by occasional flooding of the Mississippi River. Major notable floods had reached past , such as the 1950 flood, and nearly , such as the summer flooding in 2012. The 2012 flood was one of the first floods that overflowed into the lake areas, flooding the cabins, since it was caused by heavy rainfall instead of melting snow. In 2023 Downtown Aitkin flooded due to the winters record snowfall and that snowfall melting. 

Five properties in Aitkin are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the 1901 Patrick Casey House, the 1902 Potter/Casey Company Building, the 1911 Aitkin Carnegie Library, the 1916 Northern Pacific Depot, and the Aitkin County Courthouse and Jail (built in 1920 and 1915, respectively).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The Mississippi River flows through the northern edge of Aitkin. The Ripple River and Sissabagamah Creek both flow nearby.

<text>Farm Island Township is a township in Aitkin County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,099 as of the 2010 census.

==Etymology==
Farm Island takes its name from a lake island of the same name, which was cultivated by the Ojibwe people.

==History==

During the period 1896–1912, the community was served by a post office named Dorris. The community is still referred to by some as Dorris. The historic Cedar Lake Lutheran Church and adjacent cemetery are both locally referred to by the name Dorris. Early immigrants in the area include the Roms (Carlsons), Dummers, Rudes (Ruds) and Petersons. In 2006 the Rom Poultry Farm ended their egg business. Much of the land was originally transferred to the railroad, and subsequently sold to settlers. The terrain reminded the surveyors of Switzerland, and so named the Switzerland Trail (now Township Road 96).

The township&#x27;s Pine-Hickory Lakes Roadside Parking Area was developed as a New Deal project from 1937 to 1938 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 20.54%, is water. The terrain of the township contrasts with much of Aitkin County.
