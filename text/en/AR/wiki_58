<text>Carthage is a city in Jasper County, Missouri, United States. The population was 15,522 as of the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Jasper County and is nicknamed &quot;America&#x27;s Maple Leaf City.&quot;

==History==

Jasper County was formed in 1841. Carthage was chosen as the county seat, the area cleared and the town platted in 1842. The city was named after the ancient city-state of Carthage, one of the Roman Republic&#x27;s main rivals (in what is now Tunisia). By the time of the American Civil War, there were over 500 residents, a brick and stone courthouse, and several businesses.

The area was divided over slavery, and almost all of the African-Americans in the county at the time were slaves. The Battle of Carthage, fought on July 5, 1861, was a clash between Union troops from St. Louis and Confederate troops led by the pro-Southern Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson. The &quot;Second Battle of Carthage&quot; occurred in October 1863 when Union troops confronted Confederate troops north of town and forced them to return to Arkansas. The town experienced minor skirmishes and attacks throughout the war; pro-Confederate guerrillas burned most of the city (including the courthouse) in September 1864. Historical accounts, such as &quot;Jasper County, Missouri in the Civil War&quot; (1923) by Col. Ward L. Schrantz, document the regional warfare.

The area grew rapidly following the Civil War. The Missouri and Western Railway arrived in 1872. Town residents started a foundry, furniture factory, woolen and grain mills, a plow works and numerous liveries and other businesses. Leggett &amp; Platt, now a Fortune 500 company still based in Carthage, was founded in 1883. Nearby lead mines and limestone quarries also contributed significant wealth and Carthage became one of the most prosperous towns in the area. Residents poured their money into ornate Victorian-style homes, many of which are now part of the Carthage South District, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The Jasper County Courthouse, also on the National Register of Historic Places, was built of Carthage stone in 1894–95. There is a mural inside the courthouse depicting the history of Jasper County. Growth in Carthage can be documented through Sanborn maps, many of which are available online.

Numerous local buildings, in addition to the courthouse, were built in the late 19th and early 20th century out of stone from local quarries. The limestone is hard enough to be polished into &quot;Carthage marble&quot; and was used in both the interior and exterior of the state capitol building in Jefferson City, Missouri. The quarries known today as the Carthage Underground, a commercial space that utilizes but a small portion of the extensive uncharted quarries nearby.

In 1925, Ozark Wesleyan College merged three Methodist colleges into one institution and built a campus in the center of town. The college operated only a few years before closing. The campus was home to Our Lady of the Ozarks College from 1944 to 1971 and now houses the Vietnamese-American Catholic religious Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix. This Vietnamese order of priests and brothers came from Vietnam and settled in Carthage in 1975, immediately following the Vietnam War. In the monastery of this Vietnamese congregation, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục died in 1984.

U.S. Highways 66 and 71 came through town in the 1920s, and for a time the town saw a stream of cross-country traffic. Route 66 intersected with U.S. Route 71 at the present intersection of Central and Garrison Avenue. The original owners of a Boots Court motel at this crossroads promoted a drive-in restaurant with a KDMO AM radio broadcast, &quot;Breakfast at the Crossroads of America&quot;, named as a reference to the two major highways of the era. Route 66 was eventually re-routed, then replaced in the 1960s with Interstate 44 running south of town.

In the late 20th century, the town began actively courting tourism, emphasizing its history (the Battle of Carthage, Victorian architecture, and Route 66), as well as its proximity to the Precious Moments hotel and store, along with the popular country music destination Branson.

<text>Duenweg ( ) is a city in Jasper County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,495 at the 2020 census. It is located within the Township of Joplin, a minor civil division of Jasper County, and is part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is located just to the east of the City of Joplin. Interstate 44 and Interstate 49 run concurrently across the southeast corner of town, and Business Loop 44 runs through the center of town.

==History==
While the Osage tribe inhabited the general region previously, European-American settlement started in the year 1855, when two brothers, Elijah C. and James C. Webb, from Overton County, Tennessee, moved to the area. Mining in the vicinity later caught the attention of Otto Duenweg and his father, Louis, of Terre Haute, Indiana, who in 1895 purchased significant mining interests at the site. The mining camp became known from that time on as Duenweg in their honor. A post office called Duenweg has been in operation since 1895.

Rail lines came in to serve the workers and mines. The Southwest Missouri Electric Railway Company, forerunner of the Southwest Missouri Railroad Company, which had already linked Joplin, Webb City, Carterville and Prosperity by 1894, was extended south from Prosperity into Duenweg in 1903. The line was indirectly involved in a bank robbery in 1915 when, on February 17, robbers hit the Duenweg Bank, intending to escape on the streetcar to Joplin. When they missed the car by one minute, they attempted and failed to escape on foot.

The settlement was not officially incorporated until 1954, becoming the City of Duenweg. In 2002 the city expanded by annexation to include additional lands to the north and south.

Jasper was the home to Debra Dene Barnes Miles the year after she finished her reign as Miss America (from &#x27;Miss Kansas&#x27; title) in 1968.

==Education==

<text>La Russell is a city in Jasper County, Missouri, United States. The population was 134 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
La Russell is located in the valley of the Spring River, adjacent to the Jasper-Lawrence county line. Bowers Mill lies just to the northeast on the river. The Missouri-Pacific Railroad line lies along the river just to the north of the town.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The village of La Russell, Missouri was platted and laid out for public use August 18, 1903. &quot;La Russell&quot; was named in honor of &quot;Russell Harding&quot;, vice president and general manager of the Missouri-Pacific Railroad at that time and of importance to the town&#x27;s creation. The French &quot;La&quot; was added to the original proposed name of &quot;Russell&quot; in order to prevent confusion with another Missouri town named Russellville. Because of this word change, the name &quot;La Russell&quot; appears to be unique in the United States.

This had been the hunting grounds of the Osage Indians who were known to have camped at nearby Spring River, a short distance north of present-day La Russell. Their lands to the east had been previously purchased by the U.S. Government in 1808 (Treaty of Fort Clark) and other tribes had been moved to this location as well, and then later all were moved again to the Osage Nation areas elsewhere. Arrowheads and other Native American artifacts can still be found in the plowed fields near the river today.
Although La Russell itself was founded in 1903 because of the railroad, early settlers at this location were among the first in the county dating back to the 1830s. The first public school in Jasper County was established near the future site of La Russell in 1838. This was the &quot;Cave Springs School&quot;, also known as &quot;Teas School&quot; in honor of its first teacher, Samuel Teas. School sessions during the Antebellum Era were split into two periods each school year, with a summer session and a winter session because students were needed at home for spring planting and fall harvest. The Cave Springs School also served as a church and a military headquarters for the Enrolled Missouri Militia (Union) during the Civil War. Following the burning and destruction of the county seat of Carthage in the Civil War, the state governor moved the temporary Jasper County Courthouse to the Cave Springs School in 1865. The school still exists and can be visited today. A Civil War memorial was also erected by the &quot;Eastern Jasper County Historic Sites Association&quot; in 2009 at the old Cave Springs Cemetery near La Russell, one of the oldest cemeteries in Jasper County.

The city of La Russell expanded as a railroad stop for the Missouri-Pacific Railroad in 1905, at the coming of the White River line. As of 2014, La Russell is a small rural and predominantly agricultural and livestock raising community.

The La Russell Water Pump (&quot;circa&quot; 1904), conspicuously located in the middle of the road on Main Street, is a local cultural icon which dates back to the early beginnings of the town. An even earlier &quot;community water well&quot; is documented to have existed about two blocks south from the present one (before La Russell was founded), also located in the center of the road until it was replaced at the beginning of the 20th century. The &quot;La Russell Water Pump&quot; supplied water for the village inhabitants, who carried it to their homes in buckets for use, and was also a welcome sight for thirsty travelers and their horses, and in later years for filling automobile radiators in addition to a cold drink. The concrete base for the present pump was constructed by the town August 5, 1907 and shows damage from vehicle collisions that occurred over the past century because of its odd location in the center of the street. Due to increased accidents it has also been at the center of controversy in modern times as being a safety hazard, though many townspeople have fought against its removal because it is considered an historical landmark in La Russell. The debate continues to the present time, and this old beloved hand pump is traditionally decorated by locals during the Christmas holidays each year. The motto &quot;Viva La Russell&quot; has become a rallying cry for the protection of the pump and emblematic of the town itself.

Sarcoxie was platted in the early 1830s, and it was originally called Centerville from its location upon Center Creek. In 1839, the settlement was renamed in honor of Sarcoxie, a chief of the Delaware Indians who had settled near a spring in the present town limits.

During the start of the Civil War in 1861, Franz Sigel&#x27;s independent command passed through Sarcoxie on June 28 before attempting to attack the separated commands of Sterling Price and Missouri Governor and General Claiborne Fox Jackson.

<text>Webb City is a city in Jasper County, Missouri, United States. The population was 13,031 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. Webb City also has a police department, a fire department, and animal control services.

==History==
Webb City (Webbville) was platted by John C. Webb in September 1875 and incorporated in December 1876, with a population of 700. The city was located on a portion of Webb&#x27;s 200-acre farm, which he entered in February 1857. There, in 1873, Webb discovered lead while plowing. With the assistance of W.A. Daugherty, he sank the first pump-shaft in 1874. Webb then leased his land to Daugherty and G.P. Ashcraft. In 1876, the Center Creek Mining Company leased the land and began operations. Some 20 years later, 700 mines were located within the limits of Webb City and adjacent Carterville, and the district ranked first in the production of zinc ore.

Webb aided the city in its material development. He donated land for a school and the first Methodist Episcopal Church, South. He built the Webb City Bank and the first hotel.

The St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad was built to Webb City in 1879, followed by the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1881. The population increased from 1,588 in 1880 to 9,201 in 1900. After the success of the first Webb City sheet ground mine (&quot;Yellow Dog&quot;) in the 1890s, business boomed. The 100-room Newland Hotel was built and co-educational Webb City College was established. The Webb City Mining District was prominently represented at the Chicago Columbia Exposition in 1893 and at the 1898 Omaha International Exhibit. Webb City received for its mineral display the only silver medal awarded. A.H. Rogers built a mule streetcar line from Webb City to Carterville, 1889, the predecessor of the SouthWest Missouri Electric Railway, established 1893, and expanded in the 1900s to become the Southwest Missouri Railroad Company. a vast inter-urban system with a power plant, car barns and an employee clubhouse at Webb City.

The influx of miners supported a thriving saloon district on Daugherty Street, also called &quot;Red Hot Street.&quot; However due to the Prohibition movement and efforts of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, the city voted to become a dry city in 1910.

During World War I, zinc and lead concentrate produced in the Webb City ~ Carterville ~ Prosperity District were valued at more than $18 million. Webb City&#x27;s population increased to some 15,000.

In 1914, the &quot;Webb City Register&quot; reported that &quot;an aggregation&quot; took responsibility to limit the African American population of the city. The &quot;Register&quot; would describe the 1916 population of 40 Black residents as too large, calling for another periodic expulsion.

After the decline of mining in the postwar period, Webb City turned to diversified industrial and agricultural production. In the 1930s and during World War II, explosives were manufactured by powder plants located near Webb City.

The Downtown Webb City Historic District and Middle West Hotel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Jasper County, Missouri, as is the Elijah Thomas Webb Residence, an elaborate Queen Anne style three-story built by Elijah Webb, son of the town&#x27;s founder John Webb.

<text>Arnold is a city in northeastern Jefferson County, Missouri, situated near the confluence of the Meramec and Mississippi rivers. A suburb of St. Louis, the city lies within the Greater St. Louis metropolitan statistical area. The population was 20,858 at the 2020 United States census, which makes it the most populous community in the county.

== History ==
The Osage peoples were the first people that lived in what today is Arnold, many artifacts have been found in the area that show there was an ancient Osage village near where the Meramec River meets the Mississippi River. In the area where 2 salt licks used to be, human bones have been found, along with pottery shards and many other artifacts. The first European settler in Arnold, was John Hildebrand an immigrant from Germany, that lived in Monongahela County, Pennsylvania. He was the first white settler in the area that is today Jefferson county, he established a settlement near saline creek, with a fort for protection. In 1776 Jean Baptiste Gamache, who operated a ferry boat across the Meramec River was granted 1050 arpents of land by king Charles III of Spain. This ferry was on the King&#x27;s Trace or El Camino Real, from St. Louis to Ste. Genevieve, Missouri.[1] [2]

=== Eminent domain ===
Arnold was a focal point over the eminent domain issue in Missouri. In January 2004, the City of Arnold announced that THF Realty had approached them regarding developing a section of Arnold known as the Triangle, an area bordered by Route 141, Interstate 55 and Church Road in the city limits. The city voted in favor of the Triangle Development project proceeding on September 16, 2005.

According to an agreement with THF, Arnold would acquire the properties in the triangle and would be reimbursed its costs by THF. Arnold offered the property owners a buy-out, and most accepted. Some businesses were promised relocation either in the new development or elsewhere in the city. Others were not given this option. Some refused the offer, and the city moved to condemn the dissenting properties. One such hold out was Homer R. Tourkakis, the owner of a dental practice on the corner of the triangle formed by Route 141 and Interstate 55.

Tourkakis claims that THF never made a fair-market offer. THF claims they offered to rebuild his practice elsewhere and purchase his property for $600,000. Tourkakis&#x27;s property was declared blighted, and Arnold sought to seize it under eminent domain. Tourkakis fought these proceedings in the Jefferson County courts. Arnold and THF argued that although incorporated cities are not explicitly granted the use of eminent domain does not imply they are denied it. The judge ruled that because Arnold is a third-class city, under Missouri law, it cannot use eminent domain to seize properties. In appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court, the decision was reversed, ruling that through the TIF act and the City of Arnold being an incorporated municipality, had the right to use eminent domain.

===Red light cameras===
In 2005, Arnold became the first city in Missouri to install red light cameras. A 2009 lawsuit against the cameras was dismissed on procedural grounds. In 2013 the Missouri Court of Appeals Eastern District ruled the Arnold red-light camera ordinance to be unconstitutional.

===Notable events===

Festus originated as an outgrowth of older neighbor Crystal City. It was established in 1878 by an individual named W. J. Adams, and was known as &quot;Tanglefoot&quot;, supposedly because of situations involving drinkers from the local glass factory, who would drunkenly get their feet tangled in brush on their way home. The city was later called Limitville, but eventually &quot;Festus&quot; was chosen, purported to be in honor of St. Louis banker, Festus J. Wade. Others claim the town&#x27;s name was picked at random by a preacher who sat there, opened the Bible, and pointed to the name &quot;Festus&quot; in the Book of Acts. The City of Festus was incorporated in 1888 and grew to be one of the largest towns in the county. A post office called Festus has been in operation since 1883.

<doc id="122804" wikidata="Q961668" url="?curid=122804" title="Herculaneum, Missouri">
<text>Herculaneum is a city in Jefferson County, Missouri, and is a suburb of St. Louis. The population was 4,273 at the 2020 United States Census. The City of Herculaneum was the first county seat of Jefferson County from January 1, 1819, to 1839. The city celebrated its bicentennial throughout 2008.

The city received the &quot;Tree City USA&quot; designation by the Arbor Day Foundation for 11 consecutive years, 2007 through 2017. The city is the honorary hometown of the 40th Airlift Squadron, &quot;The Screaming Eagles,&quot; from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Origins==
Herculaneum was laid out by Moses Austin and Samuel Hammond in 1808 as a shipping point on the Mississippi River closer to Austin&#x27;s lead mines in Potosi than was Ste. Genevieve.

The town was named after the ancient Roman town of Herculaneum, destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Austin is said to have chosen the name because the limestone ledges overlooking the Mississippi River resembled a Roman amphitheatre.

Shot towers were constructed next to the bluffs to manufacture lead ammunition, and lead cannonballs from Herculaneum were used in the War of 1812. Lead smelting by the Doe Run Company is no longer operating and under a shutdown process. It was a major industry in Herculaneum until its closure due to inability to match increased EPA regulations due to environmental and health effects.

The name &quot;Herculaneum&quot; is a reference to the Ancient Roman city of Herculaneum which was the chief supplier of lead for the Roman Republic and Empire.

==History==
In 1798, Moses Austin, a settler from Connecticut, obtained a Spanish land grant of one square league (approximately 3 square miles) of land after learning of the richness of the area&#x27;s rich mineral deposits. After bringing in equipment and workmen from Virginia, he began mining and smelting lead despite frequent problems with the neighboring Osage tribe. In 1808, Austin and Samuel Hammond laid out a town at the mouth of Joachim Creek. The purpose of the new town was to serve as a shipping point for the lead smelted at mines in Jefferson and Washington Counties. It is believed the town was named by Austin, who called it Herculaneum because the limestone strata were so eroded that they resembled seats in the amphitheater of the ancient Roman city of Herculaneum buried by Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D.

The first post office in Jefferson County was at Herculaneum, established soon after the town was laid out, and it remained the only post office in the county for nearly thirty years.

By 1813, three shot towers had been constructed on the bluffs. These were designed for the production of shot balls by dropping molten lead through copper sieves. The balls were then caught in a water basin and taken to an adjoining building, to be turned through cylinders to round and smooth the pellets for use as projectiles in firearms.

On December 8, 1818, Jefferson County, along with seven other counties, was formed from parts of Saint Louis and Ste. Genevieve Counties by an Act of the Territory by the Missouri Territorial Legislature. In 1819, Herculaneum was named as the county seat.

At this time Herculaneum was described as a town having between thirty and forty homes, three stores, a post office, a jail, a court building, and a school. Herculaneum&#x27;s fortunes declined when the county seat was relocated to Hillsboro in 1839 and when the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway bypassed the town in the early 1850s. The community experienced a revival starting in 1887 when the St. Joseph Lead Company chose Herculaneum as a lead smelting site, and the Mississippi River &amp; Bonne Terre Railroad ran track into town.

In 1892, the first operation of the smelter began with the operation of calcine furnaces, two blast furnaces, a refinery, and a powerhouse for the generation of steam and electricity. The smelting operations are the largest in the United States, producing approximately 225,000 tons of refined lead annually. They are operated by the Doe Run Company, which bought the operations in 1981.

In 1970, acting on an incorporation petition from 1819, a committee for the incorporation of Herculaneum filed a petition with the Jefferson County Circuit Court, asking the court to order Herculaneum incorporated and to appoint commissioners to oversee an election of Board of Trustees. On September 15, 1971, the Jefferson County Circuit Court took under advisement the petition to reactivate the incorporation of Herculaneum. Attorneys presented evidence that Herculaneum was incorporated on July 27, 1819, two years before Missouri became a state. Attorneys also claimed that the boundaries of the town were well established by common knowledge. On January 7, 1972, the Jefferson County Circuit Court notified the Herculaneum incorporation committee that the 1819 incorporation was being reactivated and that Herculaneum would officially function as a city.

An election was held on April 4, 1972, for the purpose of electing a five-person board of trustees. On April 9, 1972, the trustees were sworn into office. Donald Stotler was unanimously elected to serve as the first chairman of the board of trustees. On September 5, 1972, the City of Herculaneum officially opened the doors to city offices located in the old Douglass School building at the end of Wedge Street. On April 3, 1973, the first board of aldermen and mayor were elected.

In 2013, Doe Run Company announced that it would cease operations of its smelter, citing rising regulatory costs. The December 31 closing of the smelter on the west bank of the Mississippi River, south of St. Louis, marks the end of an era in a region that has supplied most of the nation&#x27;s lead since the 1700s.

Demolition of the Doe Run Company has taken place throughout 2018.

== Lead pollution ==
The city of Herculaneum has had a decades-long pollution of the town&#x27;s soil and ground water with lead, which achieved national attention caused by the Doe Run plant, which operates a lead smelter in the area. According to &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Doe Run company trucks would carry hazardous lead-ore and slag in open bed trucks; this resulted in lead-dust accumulating on roads and streets throughout the city.

In August 2001, Herculaneum officials became concerned regarding residue and began investigating; leading to state officials testing the residual dust on the road and discovering that the lead concentration was 300,000 parts per million, 750 times exceeding the hazardous minimum. In a 2010, settlement with the EPA, Doe Run was fined $65 million and received a $7 million civil penalty. At the end of 2013, Doe Run shut down smelter operations in Herculaneum, although refining and other activities continue.

==History==
===Founding===

Lexington is located on the bluffs of the Missouri River. It was platted in 1822 near William Jack&#x27;s Ferry, which had been established three years earlier on the south bank of the river. It was named in commemoration of the Battle of Lexington. The first ferry was established in 1819 by Lexington&#x27;s founder, Gilead Rupe. In 1823, Lexington became the county seat of Lafayette County and grew rapidly.

===Growth as a trading center===
John Aull opened a mercantile store in 1822, and he was soon joined by his brothers James and Robert. The Aull Brothers firm soon had a frontier chain, also operating stores in Independence, Westport and Liberty. Other merchants came, as did farmers and planters who specialized in hemp, tobacco and cattle.

With the emphasis on trade and agriculture, Lexington and Lafayette County also had one of the largest slave populations in the state. Many homes in town still have the old slave quarters behind them.

Lexington was a bustling and prosperous city, the largest city west of St. Louis in the 1830s and 1840s. During that period, it was the major center for merchants and outfitters as trappers, traders, and emigrants prepared to travel westward on the Santa Fe Trail, California Trail, Oregon Trail, and the Mormon Trail to Utah. Goods sent west from Lexington were valued at $450,000 in 1843. Rope walks, slaughter houses, a foundry and a furniture factory were among other early Lexington industries. In the 1840s, Russell, Majors and Waddell, the largest trading firm in the West, established its headquarters on Main Street. In the 1850s, these three men had 3500 wagons carrying goods from Missouri to Sacramento, Denver, and other points, and in 1860, they would found the Pony Express.

The steamboat trade on the river became a hugely profitable investment, and the wharf was a center of commerce. Productive coal mines, among the first in the state, were dug into the surrounding river bluffs to provide fuel for river steamers. In 1852, one of the worst steamboat accidents in Missouri history occurred at Lexington. The side-wheeler &quot;Saluda&quot; was carrying 250 Mormons en route to Salt Lake City when its boilers exploded, killing over 150 people. Many children orphaned by the blast were adopted by Lexingtonians. In March 1856, the &quot;Arabia&quot; steamboat was stopped and searched by pro-slavery Border Ruffians near Lexington, who confiscated 100 rifles and 2 cannons en route to the slavery-free Kansas Territory from the abolitionist Massachusetts Aid Society.

===Architecture===
Lexington has historical architecture, especially its public buildings. The Greek Revival Lafayette County Courthouse, built in 1847 on Main Street, is the oldest courthouse in continuous use west of the Mississippi. The Masonic College, also built in the Greek Revival style, operated from 1847 to 1857, and after the Civil War, it housed the Central College for Women. The Gothic Revival Christ Episcopal Church, built in 1848, has an interior finished in walnut and a ceiling ornamented with a Gothic truss arch. Lexington has over 150 homes and public buildings built before the Civil War, and annually holds well-attended tours of its historic homes and buildings.

In addition to the Lafayette County Courthouse, the Anderson House and Lexington Battlefield, Minatree Catron House, John E. Cheatham House, Commercial Community Historic District, Cumberland Presbyterian Church, Theodore Gosewisch House, Alexander and Elizabeth Aull Graves House, Hicklin Hearthstone, Hicklin School, Highland Avenue Historic District, House at 1413 Lafayette St., David John House, George Johnson House, Linwood Lawn, Old Neighborhoods Historic District, William P. Robinson House, Thomas Shelby House, Spratt-Allen-Aull House, Thomas Talbot and Rebecca Walton Smithers Stramcke House, D. W. B. and Julia Waddell Tevis House, Waddell House, and Wentworth Military Academy are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Civil War and aftermath===
Lexington had two of the largest battles in the western campaign of the American Civil War. The better-known Battle of Lexington is commonly referred to as the Battle of the Hemp Bales. On September 12, 1861, between 6,000 and 10,000 soldiers of the Missouri State Guard, led by Major General Sterling Price, began a siege against the Federal military post in the old Masonic College commanded by Colonel James A. Mulligan.

On September 18, Price&#x27;s army mounted an assault. Some of Price&#x27;s army used hemp bales as moving breastworks while they moved up the river bluffs and closed in on Mulligan&#x27;s headquarters. On September 20, 1861, Mulligan&#x27;s troops surrendered. Combined casualties were 73 dead, 270 wounded. The battlefield on the bluffs of the Missouri River is now a state park, and the cannonball stuck in one of the upper pillars of the Courthouse has become a symbol for the town.

The Second Battle of Lexington occurred during Price&#x27;s Missouri Expedition on October 19, 1864.

Lexington was known as a center for Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders during the war. Two months after the Civil War ended, many of these guerrilla fighters who had refused to honor the cease fire finally decided to take advantage of the special Federal amnesty that was declared for such forces and turn themselves in at Lexington. While riding into town, reportedly under a white flag, they were fired upon by Union soldiers from the 2nd Wisconsin Cavalry, and Jesse James was severely wounded in the right lung. Some credit this event as a major contributing factor to his post-war career as a legendary bank robber. It is likely not a coincidence that the James-Younger Gang targeted the Alexander Mitchell bank in Lexington for the second daylight bank robbery in United States history. In December 1866, Archie Clement, an accomplice of the James brothers and perhaps the most notorious of all the guerrilla fighters, terrorized the town and was shot from his horse and killed by a sniper perched in the second floor of the Courthouse.

===Athens of the West===
Lexington never returned to its pre-war prominence, succeeded by Kansas City as the most important city in western Missouri. Particularly harmful was arrival of the transcontinental railroad, which supplanted the river commerce. Several institutions of higher education were established, leading the town to bill itself as the &quot;Athens of the West&quot;. Especially significant were three schools for women, the Elizabeth Aull Seminary, Lexington Ladies College, and Central College for Women. Until its closing in 2017, Wentworth Military Academy, founded in 1880, drew students from throughout the country and around the world.

==Lexington businesses==
Until the 1980s, Lexington was the headquarters and main distribution point for Mattingly&#x27;s and Matco Stores, which was purchased by P.M. Place Stores. In 2000 the Place&#x27;s stores were purchased by ShopKo to be converted into Pamida stores. In 2004 the former Mattingly warehouse was sold by Pamida. In August 2004 liquidation of the former Matco #101, then a Pamida, began and the store was closed by the end of October. This was the end of the Mattingly store legacy in Lexington. Hugh Mattingly had been a mentor to Wal-Mart founder, Sam Walton.

Dunbrooke began as a dress shirt company in 1939 in Lexington and became a nationwide logoed apparel manufacturer. Dunbrooke&#x27;s signature jacket line began in the 1950s under government contract to produce nylon jackets for the Korean War. The company&#x27;s name changed from &quot;Dunhill&quot; (1939) to &quot;Dunbrooke Shirt Company&quot; (1963) to &quot;Dunbrooke Sportswear&quot; (1971) to Dunbrooke Apparel Corp (2003). Dunbrooke was purchased from parent company American Marketing Industries (AMI) in October 2003.

<text>Aurora is a city in Lawrence County, Missouri, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 7,219.

==History==
The Honey Creek area, near Aurora, was originally settled by pioneers from Tennessee, including James D. Hillhouse, E. B. Hillhouse, Reverend A. A. Young, James Barrow and James Gibson. They were later instrumental in founding Aurora. Their descendants include actor Brad Pitt and novelist and national security analyst Raelynn Hillhouse.

Aurora was platted in 1870 by Stephen G. Elliott. It was reportedly named after Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn.

Galena ore was discovered in 1885 while digging a well on the farm of Thomas D. Liles in November, marking the beginning of Aurora as a mining town. Mining of surface outcrops began in 1886. Large scale commercial mining began shortly afterwards as the mines grew deeper and zinc and galena were discovered. The zinc from the Aurora mines was of exceptional purity and high grade. By 1893, 12,651 tons of zinc ore were mined and shipped from Aurora. The mines attracted prospectors and miners. Aurora&#x27;s population peaked at 10,000 &quot;circa&quot; 1900.

The Frisco Railroad (now Burlington Northern-Santa Fe) and the Missouri Pacific (now Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad) previously had depots in Aurora. The train master for the Missouri Pacific Railroad&#x27;s White River division was headquartered in Aurora until the mid-1950s.

From 1911 to 1920, the virulently anti-Catholic newspaper &quot;The Menace&quot; was published in Aurora by W. F. Phelps and Earl McClure. In 1914, it achieved a national circulation of over one million, according to the March 1932 issue of &quot;American Mercury&quot;.

The Lewis Shaw Coleman House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

<doc id="122848" wikidata="Q965440" url="?curid=122848" title="Marionville, Missouri">
<text>Marionville is a city in Lawrence County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,225 at the 2010 census.

Marionville is known for its large population of white squirrels.

==History==
Marionville was platted in 1854. The city name has been erroneously attributed as namesake of Francis Marion. It is, in fact, named to honor early settler and founder, James Marion Moore. Other names were considered - Jamestown/Jamesville and Moorestown/Mooresville - but were already taken and Moore&#x27;s middle name was then used. A post office called Marionville has been in operation since 1864. On March 12, 2006, a tornado hit the town, destroying houses and killing two people. It was rated as an F3.

The town&#x27;s two most famous residents are a colony of white squirrels (inhabitants since the 1880s) and legendary tubist Harvey Phillips.

==Geography==
Marionville is located at (37.000361, -93.638026).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Marionville has a population of white squirrels, which is one of a handful of such populations in the United States. They can be seen in yards near the Ozarks Methodist Manor.

==Government==
On April 21, 2014, the Marionville mayor, Dan Clevenger, resigned. After longtime resident and career bigot Frazier Glenn Miller Jr. shot and killed three people outside a Jewish Community Center in Overland Park, Kansas, Clevenger initially stated that he supported Miller&#x27;s beliefs but not his actions. Clevenger&#x27;s lost history of serving as Miller&#x27;s mouthpiece for anti-Semitic rants were widely reported, and Clevenger made a bumbling series of remarks that centered around him recalling how nice Miller was (as long as he was interacting with other white men) and that he still felt &quot;some&quot; of Miller&#x27;s conspiracy theories about Jews being evil were accurate (they weren&#x27;t, and Clevenger was further discredited by confirmation of this). Two Marionville officials resigned and stated they would not serve in a government that included Celvenger, and a 4–1 vote by aldermen to begin the impeachment process prompted Clevenger&#x27;s decision to quit. Clevenger later said that none of his opponents were against his views and simply used his actions as an excuse to get his office, and speculated that he would be able to win back the Mayor&#x27;s office in the near future. As of December 2024, Clevenger has not attempted any such campaigns.

<doc id="122850" wikidata="Q958619" url="?curid=122850" title="Pierce City, Missouri">
<text>Pierce City, formerly Peirce City, is a city in southwest Lawrence and northwest Barry counties, in southwest Missouri, United States. The population was 1,292 at the 2010 census. In 2010, the town annexed property along Route 97 into Barry County to a point just north of U.S. Route 60. It was estimated to have a population of 1,309 by the City of Pierce City as of July 1, 2019.

==History==

There was once a small village called St. Martha about two and a half miles west of Pierce City. It was surveyed for William Robert Wild on Section 30, Pierce Township, May 9, 1870. Wild committed suicide there on June 8, 1870. Nothing remains of the village.

===Founding and spelling===
Pierce City was laid out in 1870 as a stop on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. It was originally spelled Peirce City, named for Andrew Peirce, Jr. of Boston, president of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway. The &quot;Pierce&quot; spelling was used erroneously by the United States Postal Service and adopted officially in the 1930s. A 1982 attempt to revert to &quot;Peirce&quot; was rejected by the United States Census Bureau.

===1901 lynchings and expulsion ===
On August 19, 1901 a large white mob took three African-American men from jail in Pierce City and lynched them. French and William Godley, and Peter Hampton, were suspects in the murder of a young white woman. Two of the men were quite aged and were unlikely suspects; none had a chance at a trial. These are the only recorded lynchings in Lawrence County.

Unrest continued, and the white mob burned five black homes, and drove &quot;30 families into the woods&quot;, affecting the roughly 300 black residents in the town. (It had about 1,000 white residents.) Most of the African Americans lost all their land and property; whites simply took over the empty properties.

This was part of a pattern of violence in southwest Missouri in the early 20th century; there were also large public lynchings in Joplin and Springfield, resulting in many African Americans abandoning the region for less hostile territory. &quot;Monett, Peirce City, Rogers, Ark., and several other towns around here have driven the negros out.&quot; By 1910 only 91 African Americans remained in Lawrence County and their numbers continued to decline. The incident has been considered an act of ethnic cleansing.

In reaction, Mark Twain wrote the essay &quot;The United States of Lyncherdom&quot;, which was published posthumously.

In the 21st century, some descendants of the people who had been driven out of Pierce City threatened to file a lawsuit for the city&#x27;s failure to protect their families and to recover the value of their families&#x27; properties, but none has been filed. There have been other grassroots efforts to acknowledge these crimes and injustices.

===Notable buildings===
The Lawrence County Bank Building and Pierce City Fire Station, Courthouse and Jail are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===May 2003 tornado===
One of the most notable tornadoes of the May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence was the one that hit in Pierce City. According to reports, nearly all of the buildings in the town were damaged, destroyed, or liable to collapse. Damage was most severe in the historic downtown business district, where approximately 90 percent of the businesses and homes nearby were severely damaged, and they later had to be torn down. A nearby National Guard Armory, regularly used as the town&#x27;s storm shelter, sustained heavy damage. J. Dale Taunton was killed; he was one of the several dozen people who had fled to the shelter.

But, outside the main path of the tornado, many Pierce City structures, including homes and the Harold Bell Wright Museum, sustained little or no damage. The Pierce City tornado was rated F3 on the Fujita scale.

==History==
The town was settled in the early 1870s and was originally known as &#x27;Pax&#x27;, then later as &#x27;Belle Plaine&#x27;. It was incorporated in 1896 and renamed in memory of its founder, Capt. Greene Casey Stotts, who died in 1876. Stotts held a command in the US Army during the Civil War, distinguished himself while in charge of the 76th Enrolled Missouri Militia, Co. D, the 7th E Missouri Militia, Co. C, and the 15th Missouri Cavalry, Company C. He later represented Lawrence County in the Missouri state legislature.

Stotts discovered galena and hemimorphite deposits west of the town and began to develop the lead mining industry that later fueled Stotts City&#x27;s booming growth. He founded the Stotts City Mining Company in July, 1873. The Lawrence County Land &amp; Mining Company, formed in 1888, handled the product of the Stotts City Mining District.

In its heyday, Stotts City was home to several banks, a large hardware store, The Farmers Exchange Co-op, a cooperative enterprise of the local grain and dairy farmers, a school and numerous churches, and even had a volunteer brass band and a newspaper, &quot;The Stotts City Sunbeam&quot;, published from 1901 until the end of 1907. The population of Stotts City peaked at 902 in 1900. By 1910, the population dropped to 548.

Soon after the end of World War I, the demand for lead ore from the Lawrence County Land &amp; Mining Company subsided, as groundwater issues made it increasing difficult and expensive to mine. With a depressed agricultural industry in the 1920s, the 1929 stock market crash and Great Depression, Stotts City suffered a further reduction in population, a loss of retail businesses and closure of its one remaining bank. By December 1942, the mines and the Stotts City Mining Company were closed.

The construction of U.S. Route 66 north of Stotts City and later, Interstate 44 south of town, provided an opportunity for increased commerce. Establishments such as &quot;Hattie&#x27;s Hamburger Heaven&quot; became regional favorites.

In the 1930s and 1940s, the Farmers Exchange Co-op provided feed grain and seed for most of western Lawrence County. Until the mid-1970s, Stotts City bore a remarkable resemblance to the classic movie &#x27;western town&#x27;, with its wide main street and rows of buildings with false fronts. The old bandstand, at the corner of Mt. Vernon and Center streets, still stands; a relic of the late 19th century, as does the old native-stone schoolhouse and First Baptist Church, both built in 1898. Several descendants of the earliest residents of Stotts City still live in the area.

==Industry==
Stotts City is surrounded by cattle and dairy farms, and the area is known for world-class thoroughbred horses. In 1981, Jim and Sallie Stearns established the Stearnsy Bears, with manufacturing in Stotts City. These heirloom-quality teddy bears have been featured on Hallmark and American Greetings cards, and are shipped worldwide.

==Notable people==

<text>Canton is a city in Lewis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,774 at the 2020 census. Canton is the home of Culver-Stockton College, a small liberal arts college affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). It also had the oldest continuously operating ferry across the Mississippi River, which closed in April 2014. Four members of the United States House of Representatives have come from Canton, and are buried in the city&#x27;s Forest Grove Cemetery. Canton is part of the Quincy, IL–MO Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The city of Canton, believed to be named in honor of Canton, Ohio, predates the surrounding Lewis County by three years, having been founded in 1830, whereas the county would not be created from part of Marion county until 1833. It was founded by Issac Bland, Robert Sinclair, and Edward White—the latter constructing the town&#x27;s first home in February, 1830. The building also doubled as Canton&#x27;s first business, a tavern. Canton&#x27;s early history could well be called a tale of two cities. The village of Tully, founded in November, 1834, was just a mile north of fledgling Canton and had a slightly better area for steamboats to anchor. Being the preferred spot to load and unload cargo, Tully slowed Canton&#x27;s growth for the first two decades of its existence. However a series of floods, especially a major one in 1851, destroyed much of Tully. The few remnants of Tully were destroyed in the early 1930s during the construction of Lock and Dam No. 20. 
Canton, with its somewhat higher ground but still close river proximity experienced rapid growth over the next nine years after Tully&#x27;s demise and by 1860 had a population of over 2,000 people. The town was officially incorporated on January 28, 1851. Ferry service across the Mississippi River dates back as far as 1844 in the Canton area, the first being at Tully. On February 24, 1853 a charter was granted for the &quot;Lewis-Adams&quot; river ferry. The early ferries were paddlewheel craft with the power supplied by horses on treadmills. Local travelers and those heading westward in pursuit of a new life meant heavy use of the ferry, with early fares being 50 cents per wagon and 10 cents for travelers on foot. In an era where railroads were still few Canton, along with Alexandria, Missouri several miles upriver to the north, became major trading and shipping points for towns and counties on the northeast Missouri interior. A stage line ran from Canton as far west as Kirksville, some eighty miles away in Adair county, prior to the American Civil War.
Another key event in Canton&#x27;s history came about in 1853 with the founding of &quot;Christian University&quot;, now known as Culver-Stockton College. Closed for a period of time during the Civil War, the college reopened in 1865 and has been a foundation of the community since. Henderson Hall, a.k.a. &quot;Old Main&quot;, on the Culver-Stockton campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a strategic river port, Canton was involved considerably in the Civil War. Loyalties were heavily mixed and both the Union and Confederate armies recruited heavily in the town and surrounding area. Federal troops occupied Canton in July, 1861 to quell recent unrest and quash recruiting for the Missouri State Guard and pro-Confederate guerrillas by Lewis county residents Martin E. Green, Joseph C. Porter and others. On August 2, 1862 Colonel Porter ordered a raid on Canton. One resident was killed and another, a Union sympathizer, kidnapped by the bushwhackers, who also stole large quantities of weapons, medicine and other supplies. 

Canton continued its role as gateway to northeast Missouri agricultural after the war, with several industries catering to those needs. Pork processing had begun in the 1840s, with thousands of hogs being slaughtered by the late 1870s. Iron plows, wagons, a patented hand corn planter, and buttons—using mussel shells from the nearby river—were some of the diverse items manufactured in Canton in the 19th century. Limited rail service had existed in Canton in antebellum times but the tracks were destroyed during Civil War fighting. Rail service was finally restored to the town in 1871 with the arrival of the St. Louis, Keokuk &amp; Northwestern Railroad. While the Mississippi river has been the lifeblood of the town, it has also been Canton&#x27;s nemesis throughout the years. Major flooding has occurred many times in the town&#x27;s history. Some of the more notable, in addition to the aforementioned 1851 flood, were in 1929, 1973, 1993 and 2008. The 1929 flood was caused by a levee break. Within an hour of the break two square miles of the town and surrounding countryside were underwater, including more than 200 homes and the Canton school building but there were no deaths. During the New Deal era, Jessie Hull Mayer won the federal commission to complete a mural in the Canton post office. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. Mayer&#x27;s mural, &quot;Winter Landscape&quot; was installed in 1940 and was restored in 1971, with additional restoration work performed in 2005.

Periodic flooding of the downtown area happened again after World War II, but was largely ended by construction of a bigger and stronger levee in the 1960s. Due to the new levee the Mississippi Flood of 1973, the Great Flood of 1993 and the June 2008 Midwest floods left Canton with far less damage than previous events and spared the town from the fates of other river towns. In June, 2013 a new &quot;levee walk&quot; and wetlands area was added to the Canton riverfront. The 2,000 foot trail provides both recreation and educational possibilities about the river and its habitat. Tornadoes have also been unkind to Canton. Several smaller ones have touched down in or very near the town in its history, with most doing little damage. However, a large tornado struck Canton on May 10, 2003 damaging an estimated 100 structures, 40 of them severely, but leaving only four persons injured. The Culver-Stockton College fieldhouse, which just hours earlier had contained a large crowd for spring commencement, was virtually destroyed while the dome on Henderson Hall was also ripped away. Henderson Hall is one of three locations in Canton listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the others being the Lock &amp; Dam No 20 Historic District, and the Lincoln School building, a former school for African-American children in existence from 1880 to 1955.

In 2023, the Canton Police Department was put under investigation for a number of charges including corruption, stolen guns, missing drugs, stolen money, tampering with evidence, and officers driving drunk when on duty. Mass resignations as a result of the investigations left Canton without a police force in August 2023. During this investigation, Canton mayor, Jarrod Phillips, also resigned from his position.

<text>Monticello is a rural village in, and county seat of, Lewis County, Missouri, United States, along the North Fabius River. The population was 104 at the 2020 census, and according to this census, Monticello is the county seat with the smallest population in the State of Missouri. The town is named in honor of President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s estate in Virginia. Monticello is part of the Quincy, IL–MO Micropolitan Statistical Area. 

==History==
Following the establishment of Lewis County on January 2, 1833, two commissioners, Stephen Cleaver and Joshua Fensel, were tasked with finding a suitable location for the county seat. They passed on selecting already established villages like Tully and Canton along the Mississippi River and instead selected a location near the geographic center of the new county. An early settler, Andrew P. Williams, donated sixty acres of land and the town was laid out in the fall of 1833. However it would not be surveyed until the next year.

The county court appointed Judge J.A. Richardson the task of selecting lots upon which to build the courthouse, county jail, a schoolhouse, and church. The streets of the new county seat were also to be named, with those running north to south being Decatur, Jackson, Perry, Washington, and Water, while the east-west cross streets were christened Benton Clay, Greene, Jefferson, and Lafayette. The first houses were built in the town by William Graves, James H. McBride, and William P. Richardson very soon after the town was laid out. A hotel owned by William Ellis would follow. The first Lewis County courthouse in Monticello was a single-story primitive log structure which stood about 100 yards from the current courthouse site. Completed by June 1834, it was used only until a more substantial two-story brick courthouse could be built in 1839. Despite the North Fabius being navigable only by rafts, flatboats, and assorted small craft Monticello at first did a thriving business as a supply point for central and western Lewis County, as well as portions of neighboring Knox and Scotland counties.

The Lewis County Courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

===The Civil War===
The Monticello area, like much of Lewis County, was pro-Confederate during the American Civil War. Perhaps the town&#x27;s most significant contribution to the Southern cause was one of its most notable citizens, Martin E. Green. He and his brother, U.S. Senator James S. Green had come to Lewis County from Virginia in the mid-1830s. While James became a lawyer and politician, Martin operated a successful sawmill near Monticello. He would also enter politics, becoming a judge of the Lewis County court. With the outbreak of the Civil War and a riot at Canton on July 4, 1861, Judge Green called on Lewis County&#x27;s pro-Confederate citizens to assemble under the banner of the Missouri State Guard at a training camp on the Fabius River at &quot;Horseshoe Bend&quot; not far from Monticello. A few weeks later Green&#x27;s forces would be defeated by pro-Union Missouri Home Guards at the Battle of Athens in neighboring Clark county. Green and his band of northeast Missouri cavalrymen would go on to fight at Lexington, Missouri, Battle of Pea Ridge (Arkansas), and elsewhere in the trans-Mississippi theater. Green would rise to the rank of Confederate Brigadier General before being killed at the Siege of Vicksburg in late June 1863. Meanwhile, other units of Confederate bushwhackers and pro-Union forces would continue to clash in the county. On July 9, 1862, Confederate guerrilla leader Raphael Smith, a pre-war tanner in the area, raided Monticello with a force of eighty men. There they captured or &quot;liberated&quot; various supplies and forced one the towns ardent Union supporters to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. Smith&#x27;s group would again attempt to raid Monticello a few weeks later on September 1, but were driven off by the approach of a 300-man Union cavalry patrol.

===Post-bellum===
Times were difficult for Monticello in the years following the Civil War. Two railroads built through the county, in 1871 and 1872 respectively, bypassed Monticello for reasons that still remain unclear considering its status as county seat. Rail lines fostered better trade and allowed for towns such as Durham, Ewing, La Belle, and Lewistown to thrive and outgrow Monticello. In 1875, the need for a new county courthouse gave rival towns the chance to try and steal the county seat designation away from Monticello. In both newspaper articles and public meetings, residents of Canton, La Grange, and Lewistown all attempted to sway the county government. Lewistown citizens pledged up to $25,000 to build a new courthouse at no cost to the county, while La Grange offered to match or better that offer. Canton meanwhile, the county&#x27;s biggest and most prosperous city, topped both with a pledge of $40,000 to establish the county government there. However, the efforts of all three towns were in vain and no real challenge to Monticello as the county seat would happen again despite its dwindling population.

By 1878, the Monticello business district included the following: The Lindell Hotel at the corner of Perry and Lafayette streets, the Monticello Savings Bank and United States Post Office on Lafayette across from the courthouse, the Southern Hotel, the Monticello House (a boarding/hostel house), the schoolhouse, two churches, a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Monticello Journal&quot; and the Monticello Seminary. The latter was established by the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1872 but closed by 1887. The population of Monticello was estimated at 350 by the late 1890s.

The town&#x27;s development and population remained mostly stable through much of the 20th century; however, the farm crisis of the 1980s and the lure of better opportunities for the community&#x27;s young in larger cities led to a steep decline in the last two decades of the century. By the 2000 United States Census, the population was only 126 residents. There are still a handful of businesses operating in Monticello owing to its county seat designation. Notable among them are a bank and the Missouri Department of Revenue license bureau. Children in the Monticello area now attend school at Lewis County C-1, a.k.a. Highland school district, near Ewing.

<text>Old Monroe is a city in Lincoln County, Missouri, United States. The population was 249 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Old Monroe was the site of Fort Howard. It was laid out in 1819, and named after President James Monroe. The name was prefixed with &quot;Old&quot; in order to avoid postal conflict with Monroe City.

The Battle of the Sink Hole was fought on May 24, 1815, after the official end of the War of 1812, between Missouri Rangers and Sauk Indians led by Black Hawk. The Sauk were unaware, or did not care, that their British patrons had signed the Treaty of Ghent with the U.S. The battle was fought in a low spot near the mouth of the Cuivre River near the current day city of Old Monroe.

After the battle, in 1816, Black Hawk reaffirmed the Treaty of St. Louis after re-negotiation with the United States government.

The city was originally named &quot;Monroe&quot; and it served as the county seat from 1819 until 1823. The name would change to its current form &quot;circa&quot; 1857 when Monroe County and its county seat, Monroe City, were established. The postal office then labeled the older town as Old Monroe.

<doc id="122866" wikidata="Q2193443" url="?curid=122866" title="Silex, Missouri">
<text>Silex is a 4th-class city in Lincoln County, Missouri, United States. The population was 24 at the 2020 census, According to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 264.

==History==
Silex had its start in the 1880s when the railroad known as the Northern Hannibal Railway was extended to the town for the purpose of transportation. A post office called Silex has been in operation since 1882. The community was named after the main cash crop production of silicon sand. The Silex original township was located approximately a quarter mile north of the current old town portion now. The original town was located next to the Hannibal Railroad, and many of the town&#x27;s inhabitants worked in the silicon mine. As many settlers and farmers moved to the area for work and settling, the town started to grow. The town relocated to what is now called the old town portion of Silex due to space issues. The town had shut down the production of silicon sand due to imperfections in the sand, and most of the settlers stayed and began to farm. The town became a center point for shopping, trade, social events and festivals that brought many from afar. Some of the town&#x27;s rich history of farming and mining is standing today. One building that is still standing on MO Hwy E also known as Main Street has the engraved carving of 1908 when the building had been built. Another is the Duncan Mansion located on top on the bluff looking over the city. There are few buildings standing in the old town portion of Silex due to flooding. The town has sustained several floods that devastated the townspeople due to flash flooding. The town is surrounded by local waterways, creeks, and a river.

The town has recently annexed a portion of Missouri Highway E towards 61 to Mo RA and plans to grow the town, while keeping a small-town feel. The city&#x27;s administrator and Chief of Police William Barnes II gave the town its first city logo and slogan in early 2016. The City of Silex&#x27;s slogan is &quot;A rural City Moving Forward&quot;.

===2008 floods===
In 2008, Silex flooded and displaced most of the residents. This had a major impact on the small town, forcing it to come up with other options. With the county as a whole facing financial difficulties in revenues and the town also losing business from the flood, the trustees decided to move the residents out of the flood way and plain. After the town applied for a relocation grant from USDA, it was granted partial funding for the move in sections. First and foremost: moving the residents to a safe location. Some accomplished this by agreeing to build a new home at a special rate and were given grant funds to do so, and some residents took a portion of the grant funding and simply picked their house up and moved it up on the hill in the city&#x27;s new Stephens Bluff addition. With the move of a whole town, there were many complications in the process and these are ongoing. One is removing the old households, many of which had contaminated pipes because of the age of the homes, and re-engineering city utility services. The move of the town to its new location has taken the people out of harm&#x27;s way. But with the difficult time of the economy, the town still has an open project to this date on the original plans and struggles to meet Department of Natural Resource requirements because of the relocation project. The town had applied for infrastructure grants and received one in late 2008 for a sewer project. That came at a price of issuing bonds to pay for the project which was another out of pocket expense for residents. This is still an ongoing project to this date with the finalization of the project to be completed in December 2015.

Before the project was finalized, the town was hit with another flood in the spring of 2015. With a small work force, city employees scrambled and only one boil order was issued, and city services continued. Many residents were stunned that they had lost water in the new town portion, but during the storm that had dropped seven inches of rain on the city and points north, the new water tower was struck by lightning and disabled the pump. With all of the town&#x27;s sewer lift stations underwater and the town&#x27;s sewer treatment plant also submerged, this was a major test for the city. The workers and even the town Chief of Police jumped into action. Several people who lived just outside of town had to be rescued by boat from the second story windows of their home. &quot;This was the fastest I have ever seen it come up and I&#x27;ve lived here all my life&quot;, said local resident Johnny Thompson. The 2015 flood has been the highest flood event on record for the town. Reminiscence of this is painted on the rear wall of Baragiola Hardware and Lumber.

<text>Winfield is a city in Lincoln County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,518 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Winfield was laid out in 1879, and named after Winfield Scott Killam, the original owner of the town site. A post office called Winfield has been in operation since 1880.

On June 18, 2008, floodwaters opened a 150-foot breach in a primary levee along the Mississippi River in Winfield. The breach allowed floodwaters to claim dozens of homes and large tracts of farmland and put pressure on a secondary levee. The breach also prompted Lincoln County emergency officials to order the evacuation of residents east of Winfield. Press reports noted that some evacuees were being housed at the local high school.

On April 9, 2009, Winfield made news after it elected their popular mayor, Harry Stonebraker, to a fourth term, several weeks after he died of a heart attack. This was because ballot papers had already been printed and absentee voting had begun. He won by a landslide, securing 90% of the vote by April 9.

Winfield appointed a temporary mayor to serve until a special election was held in April 2010.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Chillicothe is a city in the state of Missouri and the county seat of Livingston County, Missouri, United States. The population was 9,107 at the 2020 census. The name &quot;Chillicothe&quot; is Shawnee for &quot;big town&quot;. Chillicothe is known as &quot;The Home of Sliced Bread&quot;.

==History of Chillicothe and Livingston County==

This territory was originally settled by indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Osage and Missouri were in the territory at the time of earliest European contact, which was mostly by French explorers and traders. By 1800 the Shawnee and Iowa had migrated here. The Shawnee came from the Ohio Country, where they had been under pressure before the American Revolution from aggressive Iroquois and later encroaching European Americans. Displacing the Osage, the Shawnee had a major village known as &quot;Chillicothe&quot; about a mile from the present-day city, named after their historic capital in their traditional lands in Ohio. &quot;Chillicothe&quot; was also the name of a major band of the tribe. Other Native American tribes in the area were the Sac and Fox, and Pottawatomi, all of whom hunted in the area.

In the early 19th century, European-American migration to Missouri increased. The original survey of Chillicothe by United States citizens was filed for record August 31, 1837, and a resurvey of the same was filed August 5, 1859. Chillicothe was incorporated as a city by an act of the General Assembly, approved March 1, 1855. It was selected as the County seat by commissioners and the first term of the county court began on May 7, 1838. In August of that year an order was made to erect the first Court House, the cost not to exceed $5,000, in the Public Square; The first circuit court for the trial of civil and criminal causes was held on the 3d of July 1887.

Livingston was settled by emigrants from the older counties and others from the Upper South states of Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as Ohio and other &quot;Old Northwest&quot; states, as the westward migration continued. Prior to completion of the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph Railroad in 1859, the city was minimally developed with cheap frame houses, with little pretense of architectural beauty or design. The building materials being hewed and sawed from the oak and walnut timber surrounding the town, as timber originally covered the site.
The railroad gave an impetus for town improvements. Soon two and three-story brick business buildings were constructed in place of the former frame structures. From 1865 to 1870, the city improved rapidly, then a lull lasted until 1875, when the erection of the beautiful three-story, $36,000 school building was started, now known as &quot;Middle School.&quot; From that time on Chillicothe made a slow, steady growth up to 1886, when the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad was built through here. That year also saw the introduction of the &quot;Water Works&quot; and electric lights. The city continued to modernize in the early 20th century.

Chillicothe was located along the first railroad completed across the State of Missouri on February 13, 1859 by the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad, later becoming the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The Wabash Railroad completed a line to Brunswick, Missouri in 1871. Passenger rail served the town for over a century. The last passenger train passed through Chillicothe in 1971, when the American Royal Zephyr between Chicago and Kansas City was discontinued. The tracks eastward toward Brookfield were abandoned in the early 1980s and have been mostly removed. The 1909 Depot was owned by the City of Chillicothe until 2016, when it was sold to Wabash BBQ to be used as a restaurant. The restaurant has since closed. 

===The Missouri Training School for Girls===
The Missouri Training School for Girls (1889-1981) was the correctional facility of the Missouri Division of Youth Services. It opened in 1889. In 1956, the school received all of the black girls after the Missouri Training School for Negro Girls in Tipton closed. The school closed in 1981.

<text>La Plata is a city in Macon County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,257 at the 2020 census, down from 1,366 in 2010. La Plata is located next to the Adair County line and is on a mainline of the BNSF Railway. The town is best known for La Plata station, which provides passenger rail service to Chicago and Los Angeles.

==History==
The beginnings of La Plata can be traced back to March 17, 1827, when Drury Davis established a trading post near the town&#x27;s current location. The ensuing few years saw Davis joined by family and friends to create a small village that included a blacksmith shop, an inn, and stagecoach station. 
La Plata was platted in 1855. It was named after the city of La Plata, in Argentina. The name is of Spanish origin meaning &quot;silver&quot;. Two men, Louis Gex and Thomas Saunders, were the primary force behind the town&#x27;s platting, and drew straws to choose the community&#x27;s name. Saunders wanted to name the town &quot;Charlottesville&quot; to honor a favorite sister, while Gex pushed for the name La Plata. Gex won out, and the town is believed to have been first incorporated on September 29, 1856. Another of the early settlers who helped in creating the town was W. W. Moore, who erected La Plata&#x27;s first hotel.

The North Missouri (later known as the Wabash Railroad) came to town in 1867, and the Santa Fe Railroad twenty years later, passing through La Plata on its route from Chicago to Kansas City. The combination of the two railroads made La Plata an ideal shipping point for timber, livestock, grains, and other goods for northern Macon County and southern portions of neighboring Adair County as well. As part of this growth, the town was incorporated as a fourth-class city on April 4, 1881, with Jacob Gilstrap serving as first mayor. La Plata&#x27;s first major industry, a creamery, was established in 1883. The facility had the capacity to produce up to 1.25 tons of butter per day. However, fire destroyed the creamery and it was never rebuilt. Other light agriculture-related industry has existed in the town over the years, including a large chicken hatchery and turkey hatchery. Two major oil pipelines pass through La Plata as well, the Prairie Pipeline being the first in 1912. A &quot;tank farm&quot; of large storage tanks was located for many years on the city&#x27;s northern edge. The Wabash Railroad through La Plata was abandoned after it was merged in 1991 with the Norfolk and Western Railway, but the Amtrak station is still in operation on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail system, and the town is served by the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;. A small but active business community still exists in the town.

The first school, named &quot;Long Branch&quot; for a nearby creek, was established in 1868. It was replaced, in 1872, by a five-room brick schoolhouse. Today, children of La Plata and the surrounding rural area are educated by the La Plata R-2 school district.

The Lester and Norma Dent House, John T. and Mary M. Doneghy House, Gilbreath-McLorn House, and La Plata Square Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Macon is a city in and the county seat of Macon County, Missouri, United States. The population was 5,457 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Macon was platted in 1856. Like the county, Macon was named for Nathaniel Macon. A post office called &quot;Macon City&quot; was established in 1856, and the name was changed to Macon in 1892.

In May 1898, there was a string of break-ins in the area of Macon. The break-ins included the theft of food and items, as well as assaults on women. In late June, there was a break-in at the home of John Koechel, a blind broom maker. During this break-in, there were references to previous assaults, an attempted assault, and a theft of two sacks of flour. Police officers followed a trail of tiny white specks to the home of Henry Williams, a 30-year-old African American man, who was later arrested with no resistance. The night of Williams&#x27; arrest, crowds formed at the courthouse, while a local pastor, Rev. G. A. Robbins, pled for the crowd to allow the law to take its proper course. The crowd moved on to the jail, and demanded Sheriff A. J. Glenn give up Williams. Glenn and his deputies refused the crowd&#x27;s demands. A man called Mr. McVicker made a speech to attempt to pacify the crowd, but was knocked out by a thrown brick. The crowd knocked down the fence, stole the key, and unlocked Williams&#x27; cell, confronting the cowering man. The mob of 200-300 men decided they would hang him from a bridge instead of electrical lights, so they would not offend the women and children in the morning. In the early morning hours of June 30, 1898, Henry Williams was lynched on the Wabash bridge; he maintained his innocence when asked if he wanted to say anything.

In November 1919 four African-Americans were arrested for allegedly robbing a white farmer. They were held at the Macon prison but on Saturday, November 15, 1919, a white mob drove into town and demanded that the sheriff hand them over. At first he refused but when the mob threatened to use dynamite to destroy the prison the four black men were handed over and they were then driven to Moberly, Missouri and lynched.

Macon was located along the first railroad built across the State of Missouri, completed by the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad on February 13, 1859. Passenger rail served the town for over a century. The last daytime train passed through the town on April 9, 1968, when the Kansas City Zephyr between Chicago and Kansas City was discontinued. The overnight variation, the American Royal Zephyr was subsequently discontinued in 1971. The depot, located between Rollins and Rubey streets, was later demolished.

The Blees Military Academy, Macon County Courthouse and Annex, and Wardell House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Macon is in southeastern Macon County. Two US highways cross in the city. U.S. Route 36, passing through the northern side of the city, leads east to Hannibal and west to Brookfield, while U.S. Route 63 passes through the city as Missouri Street, leading north to Kirksville and south to Moberly.

<text>Fredericktown is a city in and the county seat of Madison County, Missouri, United States, in the northeastern foothills of the St. Francois Mountains. The population was 4,429 at the 2020 census, up from 3,985 in 2010. The city is surrounded on three sides (east, west, and south) by the easternmost parcel of the Mark Twain National Forest.

==History==
===Exploration===
The history of Fredericktown revolves around the history of lead mining. The earliest beginnings
of Fredericktown occurred around 1715 when local Indians guided French explorers to the area, which at that time was part of Upper Louisiana, in order to show them sources of lead which the French had hoped would also contain silver.

The French governor of Louisiana, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, failed to find silver, but succeeded in recruiting other French investors in the Company of the West, organized in 1717, to exploit the mineral resources of Louisiana.

===Early settlement===
The earliest European settlement in the area near what is now Fredericktown was Mine La Motte, a small community about to the north. Mine La Motte was first settled by Europeans to mine a large vein of galena (lead ore) distributed in dolomite that reached the surface there. The need for a local source of lead for ammunition made Mine La Motte one of the earliest European settlements in the interior of the North American continent. Another earlier settlement was the French Catholic community of Saint Michel, which is located just north of the current Fredericktown site on the other side of Saline Creek.

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Americanization of the area began in earnest with an influx of second and third generation German Reformed Church settlers from Bollinger County, the next county eastward. Other American settlers were drawn to the area as well, including Moses Austin, founder of the American settlement in Texas, who mined for lead between 1800 and 1820 before going on to Texas. In 1818, the area was organized to form Madison County. The name was chosen to honor James Madison, who had been the two-term president of the United States up until two years earlier (from 1809 to 1817), and who had handled the Louisiana Purchase as Secretary of State for Thomas Jefferson. At the time that Madison County was organized, the land south of Saline Creek was owned by Col. Nathaniel Cook. A new town was laid out on Col. Cook&#x27;s higher, less flood-prone land, and named &quot;Fredericktown&quot; in honor of Col. Cook&#x27;s close friend from Bollinger County, Col. George Frederick Bollinger.

===2021 Tornado===
On October 24, 2021, the city was impacted by a destructive EF3 tornado.

===2024 Battery plant fire===
On October 30, 2024, the Critical Mineral Recovery (CMR) battery plant experienced a fire, causing explosions within the building. Residents north and east of Fredericktown were told to evacuate. The plant is said to be one of the largest Lithium-ion battery facilities in the world. Two days after the fire, thousands of dead fish were found along 2.5 mile stretches of Village Creek and St. Francis River, believed to be killed by PFAS ingredients in firefighting foam. CMR was recently acquired by Evolution Metals and intends to rebuild and expand lithium mining operations in the area, as does U.S. Strategic Metals. 

===Historic sites===
The Fredericktown Courthouse Square Historic District, Fredericktown Missouri Pacific Railroad Depot, Fredericktown United States Post Office, Madison County Courthouse, and St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railroad Depot are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Fredericktown is in northern Madison County in the valley of the Little St. Francis River, a west-flowing tributary of the St. Francis River. U.S. Route 67 runs along the western border of the city, leading north to Farmington and south to Poplar Bluff. Missouri Route 72 passes through the north side of Fredericktown, leading east to Jackson and west to Ironton.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city of Fredericktown has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.78%, are water. City Lake, a reservoir on the Little St. Francis River, is in the northern extent of the city.

Black Mountain is southwest of Fredericktown. Highway E runs along the base of Black Mountain, beside the St. Francis River. While Black Mountain is only the 42nd highest point (above sea level) in Missouri, the mountain has the largest difference in elevation from the base to the summit. The St. Francis River, at the base of Black Mountain, is approximately 540 feet above sea level. The summit of Black Mountain is 1,502 feet above sea level, which is a difference of approximately 962 feet. In contrast, Taum Sauk Mountain, the highest point in Missouri, only rises about 700 feet from its base, because it rises from an already elevated plain. Taum Sauk is the highest mountain in Missouri; Black Mountain is the tallest.

==Geology==
Fredericktown is nearly unique in the United States for the variety of minerals and metals that have been found and commercially mined nearby, including lead, iron, copper, silver, cobalt, nickel, zinc, tungsten, and small amounts of gold, all of which have been mined at various times within of the town. The mines immediately east of the town, in what has been called the Old Lead Belt, were at one time one of the largest sources of lead in the United States. One of the oldest, and possibly the oldest, lead mines on the North American continent can be found six miles (10 km) north, in Mine La Motte. While little or no iron has ever been mined in Madison County, very large deposits of mostly hematite with associated magnetite exist to the west in Iron County. These deposits have been mined since at least Civil War times.

West of Fredericktown but still within Madison County is the Silver Mines Recreation Area, which is situated along a steep river gorge of the St. Francis River. This area contains the ruins of both a 1920s silver mine and a World War II era tungsten mine. Examples of the minerals that were once mined can still be found in the abundant tailings on the south side of the St. Francis River, just downstream of a now-breached stone dam. They consist of metallic-appearing sulfides such as sphalerite, arsenopyrite, and marcasite embedded in opaque veins of quartz. Careful searchers can also find crystals of wolframite, a tungsten ore that was mined briefly during World War II when access to other sources was cut off, and small grains of topaz, which caused the earlier silver miners of the area considerable economic grief by wearing out their diamond-tipped drills more quickly than anticipated. Both highly magnetic magnetite and slightly magnetic ilmenite (titanium ore) grains can be found in patches of black sands left along the beach of the main swimming area.

Madison County also contains unique igneous rocks not found anywhere else, such as Devonite , a colorful decorative stone found only in a single igneous intrusion dike on Mount Devon.

<doc id="122902" wikidata="Q954354" url="?curid=122902" title="Noel, Missouri">
<text>Noel is a city in McDonald County, Missouri, United States, along the Elk River. The population was 2,124 as of the 2020 census, up from 1,832 in 2010. The city is in the southwest corner of Missouri, just north of the Arkansas border.

==History==
A post office called Noel has been in operation since 1886. The community was named for Clark Wallace &quot;C.W.&quot; and William Jasper &quot;W.J.&quot; Noel; brothers, stockmen, and owners of a sawmill. The town was founded after the Kansas City, Pittsburg, and Gulf Railroad arrived.

Noel has capitalized on its Christmas-themed name, along with North Pole, Alaska, Christmas, Michigan, Santa Claus, Indiana, and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Each year, tens of thousands of Christmas cards and letters are sent to the USPS Noel Post Office during the holiday season to be stamped with a postmark reading, &quot;Noel, Mo. - &quot;The Christmas City in the Ozark Vacation Land&quot;&quot;. This practice became popular in the late 1940s when Kate Smith, a radio and television singer, began telling the &quot;Noel Story&quot; during her broadcasts. Most of the year, area residents pronounce Noel as rhyming with &quot;mole&quot;, in honor of the town&#x27;s namesake, Bridges Noel. 

On August 3, 1969, a freight train exploded while passing through Noel, spraying fragments of metal through houses and buildings over a six-block area. One person was killed, and 40 others injured.

Noel was home to a Tyson Foods chicken-processing plant. By 2010, an estimated 400 to 500 Somali refugees, and 60 and 70 Sudanese refugees, out of 1,800 residents, lived in the town, most of whom worked for Tyson Foods. In 2011, 130 Muslim employees stopped working temporarily after they were allegedly discouraged from praying five times a day for fear of low productivity. Tyson Foods later released a statement dismissing it as a cross-cultural misunderstanding.

A mosque was established in 2009, and an African grocery store which sells headscarves and rugs in 2010; both are located on Main Street. In 2017, the mayor, John Lafley, said that the Muslim refugees &quot;want to practice their Sharia law here, and that&#x27;s one thing the city won&#x27;t tolerate.&quot; On December 28, 2020, an early morning fire broke out at the African grocery. It was destroyed. The fire spread to the adjacent mosque as well as other businesses. One person inside the store suffered extensive burns from which they died. A few days after the fire, the Islamic Society of Joplin launched a fundraising campaign to find a new home for the mosque. The goal was met, raising $100,480.

==Geography==
Noel is in southwestern McDonald County, north of the Arkansas border. Missouri Route 90 passes through the city as its Main Street, leading east to Jane and west to Southwest City next to the Oklahoma border. Missouri Route 59 runs through the west side of Noel, briefly joining Route 90 near the center of town. Route 59 leads north to Anderson and south to Sulphur Springs, Arkansas.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Noel has a total area of , of which are land and , or 3.62%, are water. The Elk River passes through the city, flowing northwest to join the Neosho River in Oklahoma and part of the Arkansas River watershed.

<text>Pineville is a city in and the county seat of McDonald County, Missouri, United States. The population was 802 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Pineville was originally named &quot;Maryville&quot;, and was laid out under the latter name in 1847. The name was changed to &quot;Pineville&quot; in 1849 since another community already had the name of Maryville. Some say that Pineville was named for a grove of pine trees at the original town site, while others believe the name is a transfer from Pineville, Kentucky.

On August 17, 1897, Pineville was the site of a bank robbery which was one of the few at that time that involved a woman as an active participant in the actual robbery. Cora Hubbard, who was 20 at the time, John Sheets, a 23-year-old from Missouri, and 31-year-old Albert Whitfield &quot;Whit&quot; Tennison robbed the McDonald County Bank, stealing a total of $589.23 (). All three were soon captured and imprisoned.

&quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939) was filmed almost entirely in Pineville. The sequel &quot;Belle Starr&quot; (1941) was also filmed here.

The county&#x27;s historic Old McDonald County Courthouse, which is operated as a museum by the McDonald County Historical Society, was named to the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 2012.

==Geography==
