<text>Kimball Township is a civil township of St. Clair County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 9,609.

==Communities==
There are a few unincorporated communities within the township: 
* Kimball is near the center of the township at Ditty and Dove Roads just east of North Pine River Road (; Elevation: 636 ft./194 m.). Land purchases were made as early as 1825 but settlement did not begin until about 1840 when Barzillai Wheeler and John S. Kimball arrived. When the township was organized in 1855, it was named for Kimball. It was a station on the Port Huron and Northwestern Railway in 1882 and was given a post office as &quot;Kimbal&quot; in December 1882. The spelling was corrected to Kimball in January 1889 and the office closed in June 1908.
* Smiths Creek is at the southwestern corner of Kimball Township and the northern portion of Saint Clair Township on the Smiths Creek tributary of the Pine River at . Both the community and the stream were named for Elisha Smith, an early landowner. A post office was established in October 1861. It was given a station on the Grand Trunk Railroad line in 1865. Smiths Creek was the county seat of St. Clair County from 1869 until April 1871, when it was removed to Port Huron. The St. Clair County Sanitary Landfill is located in Smiths Creek. Smiths Creek is said to be where Thomas Edison was kicked off the train, because of his experiments. The train depot is now at Greenfield Village, a part of the Henry Ford. The Smiths Creek ZIP code, 48074, serves all of Kimball Township.
* Sparlingville is on the west side of the township at Allen and Griswold Roads (; Elevation: 653 ft./199 m.). It was founded by George Sparling, a builder and land developer &quot;circa&quot; 1923. Sparlingville was at one time an incorporated area. The Kimball Township hall is located near Sparlingville, the fire hall, library, and Sparlingville Elementary are located in the community.
*Thornton, also spelled Thorton, is on the boundary with Wales Township.
* Wadhams is in the northeast corner of the township at Wadhams and Lapeer roads ( ; Elevation: 669 ft. /204 m.). In 1825, Scotsman Robert Smart, with the backing of Detroit interests, built a mill on the Black River. He named the place &quot;Clyde Mills&quot;, after the River Clyde in Scotland, where Smart had lived as a boy. In 1827, Smart sold the mill to Ralph Wadhams. A post office with the name Clyde Mills operated from March 1835 until December 1872. Clyde Township was organized in March 1836 and took its name from the settlement. When first organized, Clyde Township encompassed the area of what are now 20 townships. When Kimball Township was set off in 1855, the settlement by which Clyde Township derived its name became part of a different township; a fact with reportedly greatly disappointed Ralph Wadhams. A post office was operated with the name &quot;Wadhams&quot; from June 1886 through October 1887, and again from February 1890 until October 1905. Wadhams has experienced many new developments due to its proximity to Interstate 69 (I-69) and Old M-21 (the former route of M-21.)
*West Tappan is located south of Wadhams and I-69 on Wadhams Road at the rail tracks ( ; Elevation: 659 ft./201 m.)

<doc id="119121" wikidata="Q3239483" url="?curid=119121" title="Marine City, Michigan">
<text>Marine City is a city in St. Clair County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located on the west bank of the St. Clair River, it is one of the cities in the River District north of Detroit and south of Lake Huron. In the late 19th century, it was a major center of wooden shipbuilding and lumber processing.

The population was 4,079 at the 2020 census. The city formerly featured an international auto ferry service, The Bluewater Ferry to Sombra, Ontario, Canada across the river.

==History==

The area of Marine City had been Ojibwa territory for centuries before the first European contact. Beginning in the 17th century, French trappers and missionaries entered the territory, followed by settlers in the colonial period on both sides of the Detroit and St. Clair rivers. Farmers developed long, narrow plots that were laid out in the typical rectangular shape of colonial French, with the narrow end along the riverfront. The first Catholic Church was built by French Catholics at Catholic Point, where they had bought land before the United States was formed. French Canadians also lived on the other side of the river in a small farming community known as Petite Côte.

It was not until after the American Revolution that European-American settlers arrived in any number. In the 1780s they obtained a deed for land from the Chippewa Indians. The Americans began to call the community &quot;Yankee Point&quot;, because so many settlers came from the Northern Tier of states, with late 18th and 19th-century westward migration originating from New England and New York. They also called the settlement &quot;Belle River&quot; (&quot;Belle Riviere&quot; in French), as the French had; this later was applied as the name of a neighborhood.

The village was platted by Americans as Newport in 1835–37. Although never incorporated by that name, it was known as &quot;Newport&quot; for 31 years. In 1865, it was incorporated as the Village of Marine City. Thriving on lumber trade and shipbuilding, the village re-incorporated as a city in June 1887.

The second half of the 19th century was the period of great growth in the village, with many workers employed in the lumber and shipping industries. Rafts of lumber were moved down the St. Clair River in the spring to be worked at Marine City or Detroit. Shipyards built some of the many wooden ships that crossed the Great Lakes. Lake steamers linked passengers with small towns around the lakes. Their decks were full and their flags were flying. Marine City was centered on a park by the St. Clair River, where bands played in the bandstand at City Hall during the summer.

As the lumber business ran down with the exploitation of forests, the area became linked to other resource extraction. Freighters carried iron from Duluth, Minnesota, which had been mined in the Mesabi Range, to Ashtabula, Ohio for steel processing. They passed from Lake Superior through Lake Huron and to Lake Erie. Marine City was known as the town on the St. Clair River where the captains of lake freighters lived. Many of these men and their crews worked for the Pittsburgh Steamship Company. Formed in 1901 by US Steel Corporation, it became the largest commercial fleet on the Great Lakes.

In the 21st century, Marine City has become the home of ten antique stores. The Snug Theater is a 98-seat theater featuring live performances. It will be joined in 2014/15 by a sister theater, The Riverbank Theater, in a former bank building (originally Marine Bank &amp; Trust) down the street. Also joining the two acting theaters is the old Mariner Theatre, which serves as a special event center, movie theater, gallery for fine art Models, and site of the builders model for the ocean-going &quot;Titanic&quot;. Restaurants and retail in downtown also cater to visitors and residents.

The Heather House, now operated as a bed and breakfast, was built in the Queen Anne Victorian-style. It was completed in 1885 after 2 years of construction for its owner, William Sauber. He was chief engineer for the Mitchell fleet of Great Lake steamers.

==Geography==
*According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.
*It is considered to be part of the Thumb of Michigan, which in turn is a subregion of the Flint/Tri-Cities.
**Marine City can also be considered as in the Blue Water Area, a subregion of the Thumb.
*It is part of the Detroit-Warren-Livonia Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and the Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint Combined Statistical Area (CSA).

<text>Marysville is a city in St. Clair County of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 9,959 at the 2010 census. The municipality was founded in 1919, first as a village, then became a city in 1924.

Marysville is located on the western shore of the St. Clair River, across from Corunna, Ontario. The city is marked by winding streets, subdivisions, a riverfront boardwalk, Bridge-to-Bay Bike Trail and an industrial park. The city was home to the former Wills Sainte Claire Automotive company, a Morton Salt plant, and the Detroit Edison Marysville Power Plant which was decommissioned in 2001 and razed in 2015.

==Geography==
* According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.
* It is considered to be part of the Thumb of Michigan.
**Marysville can also be considered as in the Blue Water Area.
* The city lies on the border between Michigan and Ontario formed by the St. Clair River
* Marysville is neighbored by Port Huron, Michigan to the north, St. Clair, Michigan to the south, Kimball Township, Michigan to the west, and Corunna, Ontario to the east.

==History==
Marysville traces its history back to 1786 when Antoin Morass built a sawmill at Bunce Creek. Later, in 1817, Zephaniah W. Bunce sailed up the St. Clair River and settled at the place of the mill, naming it Bunce Creek. This would later become the property of the Detroit Edison Marysville Power Plant. He later became postmaster and a member of the Michigan Territorial Council.

Meanwhile, two businessmen, Meldrum &amp; Park, founded a sawmill in 1792 at the location now known as Cuttle Creek. This settlement was located in the southern part of current day Marysville, two streets are named after them.

Also having a street named for him was Colonel Andrew Mack, a native and the 11th mayor of Detroit. He bought Meldrum and Park&#x27;s mill and built his home and a general store along the St. Clair River. The small settlement with Mack&#x27;s general store and mill was called &quot;Mack&#x27;s Place&quot; and was awarded a post office. Mack was a state representative, Colonel in the War of 1812, and a co-founder of the Detroit Free Press. Colonel Mack and his wife, Amelia, are buried on the north bank of Cuttle Creek in the Riverview Golf Course.

Later, Edward P. Vickery settled at the present day foot of Huron Boulevard in Marysville. He named the operation Vickery&#x27;s Landing and the settlement surrounding it eventually became known as Vicksburg. In 1854, the Mack&#x27;s Place post office was transferred to Vicksburg. However, there was already another Vicksburg, Michigan, so in 1859 the name was changed to Marysville, after Nelson Mill&#x27;s wife Mary.

These small settlements were brought together by inventor and engineer, C. Harold Wills. He worked at the Ford Motor Company, and was considered the &quot;right-hand man&quot; of Henry Ford. His contributions to the Ford company included designing Models A through T of the early Ford Motor Company. He was the inventor of many auto improvements including the planetary transmission used in the Models S and T. He was a pioneer in the use of vanadium steel and designed the &quot;Blue Oval&quot; logo, still used on Ford Products today. He resigned in 1919 and moved to Marysville to establish the C. H. Wills &amp; Company on the banks of the St. Clair River. Two years later in 1921, the first Wills Ste. Clair automobile was produced (named for the factory&#x27;s location on the St. Clair River). The factory closed in 1926 after 14,000 vehicles were made by the Wills factory.

Wills&#x27; and his partner John Lee provided much of the early infrastructure of Marysville, including electricity, sidewalks, roads, etc. so that Wills is credited with the street design and city planning of Marysville. He nicknamed Marysville the &quot;Dream City&quot;. The main area of the city to be developed before his company folded was the area surrounding Washington Elementary School. The community was deeply affected by the Great Depression, and the vision for the city was never fully realized. Subdivision development in the later half of the 20th century has further offset the strategic plan for the City of Marysville.
Wills did succeed to the extent that the Marysville area is nowadays a vibrant community. Wills&#x27; former factory currently houses the Chrysler Corporation MOPAR parts distribution facility.

Marysville was incorporated as a village in 1919. It became an incorporated city in 1924.

==Present Day==
Today, Marysville is a growing community, lacking a central downtown area. Most of the retail and restaurants are located along Gratiot Blvd. and Michigan Avenue. The city&#x27;s administrative office and police and fire departments are located on Delaware Ave. The large industrial area is located in the southern half of the city along M-29, which snakes through Marysville. The city park and the older residential neighborhoods are along Huron Boulevard, as well as an area located off of M-29 near Gratiot Boulevard, known as the &#x27;Salt Block&#x27;, which had originally been constructed to house workers of Morton Salt Company.

==Economy==
Marysville has a very developed industrial economy. It houses a major Intertape Polymer factory and Mueller Brass factory. Marysville is also home to Marysville Hydrocarbons, site of a recently completed ethanol plant near the southern city border. Marysville has a growing industrial park, which includes an auto parts (previously Chrysler) factory, an addition to the MOPAR parts distribution center. In 1973, Consumers Energy built a synthetic gas plant near Marysville Michigan. It was the first of its kind ever built. In 1973 the Marysville gas reforming plant could produce up to 100 million cubic feet of gas per day. That doubled in 1974 when a second train was brought on line, providing up to of gas per day from 50,000 barrels/day of liquid hydrocarbon feedstock. The plant used natural gas liquids imported from Ontario via a pipeline under the St. Clair River. The gas produced was of comparable quality to natural gas. At one point, Marysville gas powered over one quarter of all Consumers Power customers in Michigan. It also helped lessen the effects felt by Consumers Power customers during the 1973 oil crisis. The plant was shut down for economic reasons in 1979. It is now the location of Marysville Hydrocarbons, an ethanol refinery. Many local corn growers and elevators truck their grain to Marysville for ethanol processing. Marysville Hydrocarbons is the only one of its kind in the immediate area.

Commercially, Marysville includes a Meijer supermarket and numerous local places of business.

==Climate==

==Government and politics==
In August 2019, a comment made by a candidate for Marysville City Council during a &quot;Meet the Candidates&quot; forum hosted by WPHM made national and international news. Jean Cramer was asked about how to grow the city&#x27;s population and stated she wished to, &quot;Keep Marysville a white community as much as possible.&quot; Audio of the exchange, which also included remarks about interracial marriage and immigrants was picked up by outlets including CNN, Washington Post, and New York Times. Cramer would later end her campaign yet still earned 180 votes.

<text>Port Huron is a city and county seat of St. Clair County, Michigan, United States. The population was 28,983 at the 2020 census. The city is bordered on the west by Port Huron Township, but the two are administered autonomously.

Port Huron is located along the source of the St. Clair River at the southern end of Lake Huron. The city is along the Canada–United States border and directly across the river from Sarnia, Ontario. The two cities are connected by the Blue Water Bridge at the eastern terminus of Interstate 69/Interstate 94. Port Huron has the easternmost point of land in the state of Michigan and is also one of the northernmost areas included in the Detroit–Warren–Dearborn Metropolitan Statistical Area (Metro Detroit).

==History==

This area was long occupied by the Ojibwa people. French colonists had a temporary trading post and fort at this site in the 17th century.

In 1814, following the War of 1812, the United States established Fort Gratiot at the base of Lake Huron. A community developed around it. The early 19th century was the first time a settlement developed here with a permanent European-American population. In the 19th century, the United States established an Ojibwa reservation in part of what is now Port Huron, in exchange for their cession of lands under treaty for European-American settlement. But in 1836, under Indian Removal, the US forced the Ojibwa to move west of the Mississippi River and resettle in what are now the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota.

In 1857, Port Huron became incorporated. Its population grew rapidly after the 1850s due a high rate of immigration: workers leaving poverty, famine, and revolutions in Europe were attracted to the successful shipbuilding and lumber industries in Michigan. These industries supported development around the Great Lakes and in the Midwest. In 1859 the city had a total of 4,031 residents; some 1,855, or 46%, were foreign-born or their children (first-generation Americans).

By 1870, Port Huron&#x27;s population exceeded that of surrounding villages. In 1871, the State Supreme Court designated Port Huron as the county seat of St. Clair County.

On October 8, 1871, the city, as well as places north in Sanilac and Huron counties, burned in the Port Huron Fire of 1871. A series of other fires leveled Holland and Manistee, as well as Peshtigo, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois on the same day. The Thumb Fire that occurred a decade later, also engulfed Port Huron.

In 1895 the village of Fort Gratiot, in the vicinity of the former Fort Gratiot, was annexed by the city of Port Huron.

The following historic sites have been recognized by the State of Michigan through its historic marker program.
* Fort St. Joseph. The fort was built in 1686 by the French explorer Duluth. This fort was the second European settlement in lower Michigan. This post guarded the upper end of the St. Clair River, the vital waterway joining Lake Erie and Lake Huron. Intended by the French to bar English traders from the upper lakes, the fort in 1687 was the base of a garrison of French and Indian allies. In 1688 the French abandoned this fort. The site was incorporated into Fort Gratiot in 1814. A park has been established at the former site of the fort. 
* Fort Gratiot Light. The Fort Gratiot Lighthouse was built in 1829 to replace a tower destroyed by a storm. In the 1860s workers extended the tower to its present height of . The light, automated in 1933, continues to guide shipping on Lake Huron into the narrow and swift-flowing St. Clair River. It was the first lighthouse established in the State of Michigan.
* Lightship &quot;Huron&quot;. From 1935 until 1970, the &quot;Huron&quot; was stationed in southern Lake Huron to mark dangerous shoals. After 1940 the &quot;Huron&quot; was the only lightship operating on the Great Lakes. Retired from Coast Guard Service in 1970, she was presented to the City of Port Huron in 1971.
* Grand Trunk Railway Depot. The depot, which is now part of the Port Huron Museum, is where 12-year-old Thomas Edison departed daily on the Port Huron–Detroit run. In 1859, the railroad&#x27;s first year of operation, Edison convinced the railroad company to let him sell newspapers and confections on the daily trips. He became so successful that he soon placed two newsboys on other Grand Trunks running to Detroit. He made enough money to support himself and to buy chemicals and other experimental materials.
* Port Huron Public Library. In 1902 the city of Port Huron secured money from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie to erect a municipal library and arranged for matching operating funds. In 1904, a grand Beaux-Arts-style structure was built at a cost of $45,000. At its dedication, Melvil Dewey, creator of a widely used book classification system, delivered the opening address. The Port Huron Public Library served in its original capacity for over sixty years. In 1967, a larger public library was constructed. The following year the former library was renovated and re-opened as the Port Huron Museum of Arts and History. An addition was constructed in 1988.
* Harrington Hotel. The hotel opened in 1896 and is a blend of Romanesque, Classical and Queen Anne architecture. The hotel closed in 1986, but a group of investors bought the structure that same year to convert it into housing for senior citizens. The Harrington Hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
* Grand Trunk Western Railroad Tunnel. The tunnel was opened in 1891 and links Port Huron with Canada. This international submarine railway tunnel was the first international tunnel in the world. The tunnel&#x27;s total length is , with underwater. The tunnel operations were electrified in 1908; half a century later they were converted to use diesel fuel. Tracks were lowered in 1949 to accommodate larger freight cars. During World War I, a plot to blast the tunnel was foiled. A new tunnel has since been opened.

The city was hit by a violent F4 tornado on May 21, 1953, damaging or destroying over 400 structures, killing two, and injuring 68.

The city received the All-America City Award in 1955 and 2005.

In June 1962, the Port Huron Statement, a New Left manifesto, was adopted at a convention of the Students for a Democratic Society. The convention did not take place within the actual city limits of Port Huron, but instead was held at a United Auto Workers retreat north of the city (now part of Lakeport State Park). A historical marker will be erected on the site in 2025.

Port Huron is the only site in Michigan where a lynching of an African-American man took place. On May 27, 1889, in the early morning, a mob of white men stormed the county jail to capture 23-year-old Albert Martin. A mixed-race man, he was accused of attacking a woman. They hanged him from the 7th Street Bridge. A memorial was installed in 2018 at the site, recounting Martin&#x27;s history. The city collaborated with the Equal Justice Initiative on this memorialization.

On November 11, 2017, veterans from around the country, such as Dave Norris, Clitus Schuyler, and Lou Ann Dubuque, joined together at a cemetery in Port Huron to share the significance of Veterans Day.

In April 2023, the Pere Marquette Railway bascule bridge was demolished after a nearly decade long battle between preservationists and the Port Huron Yacht Club. Built in 1931, the structure was eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and was one of only six similar bridges remaining in the US.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is considered to be part of the Thumb area of East-Central Michigan, also called the Blue Water Area. The easternmost point (on land) of Michigan can be found in Port Huron, near the site of the Municipal Office Center and the wastewater treatment plant.

Its leading career scorers were Ken Gribbons, who played most of his career in the IHL; Bob McCammon, a lifelong IHLer who went on to be a National Hockey League coach with the Philadelphia Flyers and the Vancouver Canucks; Bill LeCaine and Larry Gould, who played a handful of NHL games with the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Vancouver Canucks, respectively.

Legendary NHL hockey broadcaster Mike Emrick started his career doing play-by-play hockey for the Flags on AM 1450 WHLS in the mid 1970s. Emrick would go on to broadcast Olympic hockey games and Stanley Cup playoffs for NBC Sports, and is a frequent guest contributor to sister station WPHM.

Originally called the Border Cats, the team was renamed the Beacons in 2002, the Flags in 2005 and the Icehawks in 2007. Among the more notable players were Bob McKillop, Jason Firth, Tab Lardner and Brent Gretzky.

The Port Huron Fighting Falcons of the junior North American Hockey League played at McMorran Place, beginning in 2010 until 2013. The team moved to Connellsville, PA for the 2014 season. The team&#x27;s name was changed to the Keystone Ice Miners.

==Economy==

===Industry===

Some of Port Huron&#x27;s earliest industries were related to the agriculture industry. A large grain elevator was located on the St. Clair River just north of the current Municipal Office Center. A bean dock was located on the St. Clair River, where dry edible beans from points north in the Thumb were loaded into ships. The dock operated as the Port Huron Terminal Company. Currently the bean dock is used as an event venue. Port Huron was also a national leader in the chicory coffee substitute industry. Future Congressman Henry McMorran in 1902 started Port Huron&#x27;s chicory processing plant, located on the Black River near 12th Avenue. A second chicory plant operated at 3rd and Court Streets in Port Huron, which would later be purchased by McMorran&#x27;s son. The roadside weed which grew in areas of the Thumb and Saginaw Valleys was brought to Port Huron for processing and then shipped worldwide. Chicory was commonly used as a coffee substitute especially in wartime.

Wartime also brought another industry to Port Huron: the Mueller Metals Company, which built a factory in Port Huron in 1917. The plant primarily made shell casings for World War I. The factory was originally owned by the Mueller Co., and since has been spun off into its own entity called Mueller Industries. The Port Huron Factory is still in operation, located on Lapeer Road on the city&#x27;s west side, where they produce a variety of valves and fittings.

The Peerless Cement Company operated a cement plant just south of the Blue Water Bridge from the 1920s through the 1970s. The waterfront site is now the location of the Edison Inn and Blue Water Convention Center.

There are two paper mills in Port Huron. Dunn Paper operates a specialty paper mill at the mouth of the St. Clair River just north of the Blue Water Bridge. Domtar also operates a paper mill in Port Huron, located on the Black River. It was originally built in 1888 by the E. B. Eddy Company. The Domtar mill also specializes in specialty papers for the medical and food service industries. Adjacent to the Domtar Mill is the site of the former Acheson Colloids Company. Dr. Edward Acheson in 1908 founded the company, which made a variety of chemical and carbon-based products. The factory was purchased by Henkel and closed in 2010. However, Henkel continues to manufacture ink and carbon products under the Acheson brand.

Port Huron&#x27;s Domtar Mill closed in 2021, followed by the Dunn Paper Mill in 2022.

A variety of factories related to the automotive industry occupy Port Huron&#x27;s Industrial Park on the city&#x27;s south side. Many of these produce plastic components for vehicles.

====Shipbuilding====

Jenks Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1889, renamed in 1903 as &quot;Port Huron Shipbuilding&quot; and ceased operations sometime after 1908. The shipyard was found on the north bank of the Black River between Erie Street and Quay Street which is now a parking area for Bowl O Drome and Port Huron Kayak Launch.

Ships built by Jenks includes:

* SS John B. Cowle - bulk freighter 1902
* MS Normac - former fireboat and floating restaurant 1902

===Healthcare===

Port Huron is served by two acute care facilities, McLaren Port Huron (formerly known as Port Huron Hospital), and Lake Huron Medical Center (formerly known as St. Joseph Mercy Hospital Port Huron).

McLaren Health Care Corporation, a nonprofit managed care health care organization based in Flint, purchased the former Port Huron Hospital and began operating the 186-bed facility as Mclaren Port Huron in May 2014.

Lake Huron Medical Center, is a 144-bed facility operated by Ontario, California based Prime Healthcare Services. The for-profit company purchased the former St. Joseph Mercy Port Huron hospital in September 2015 from Trinity Healthcare. Upon completion of the sale, the formerly non-profit Catholic institution converted to a for-profit entity.

==Media==
===Radio===

The first station to sign on in Port Huron was WAFD, which stood for &quot;We Are Ford Dealers&quot;. The station was owned by the Albert B. Parfet Company, a local Ford car dealership. WAFD signed on March 4, 1925, and signed off in 1926, with plans to relocate the station to Detroit.

WHLS, coinciding with the opening of the Blue Water Bridge, signed on in 1938. It was founded by Harold Leroy Stevens and Fred Knorr. John Wismer became part owner of the station in 1952. He would later launch the first cable television system in Port Huron and WSAQ in 1983. Wismer died in 1999. WHLS remains the longest continually operated station in the region.

The Times Herald launched its own radio station in 1947 known as WTTH. That station would later become WPHM, and was bought by Lee Hanson in 1986. WPHM got FM sister station WBTI in 1992. Wismer and Hanson were direct competitors until they were both bought by Bob Liggett&#x27;s Radio First in 2000.

Radio First owns and operates five radio stations in the region while Port Huron Family Radio is the licensee of sole station WGRT. Non-commercial stations include WRSX (an affiliate of Michigan Public and NPR), high school station WORW, and religious broadcasters WNFA and WNFR.

<text>St. Clair is a city in St. Clair County in the eastern &quot;Thumb&quot; of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 5,485 at the 2010 census. The city is located on the St. Clair River near the southeast corner of St. Clair Township.

==Geography==

* It lies in the Thumb of Michigan.
**Saint Clair can also be considered as in the Blue Water area, a subregion of the Thumb.
*The City of St. Clair has much upscale housing along the St. Clair River. The Saint Clair area attracts many tourists from Metro Detroit.

==Naming==
Located on the western banks of the St. Clair River, the city&#x27;s name is taken from the river. It was named for Lake Saint Clair, named by French explorers in the 17th century. The expedition of French explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle entered the lake on August 12, 1679, the feast day of Saint Clare of Assisi, and named it &quot;Lac Sainte-Claire&quot; in her honor.

On English maps as early as 1710, the lake is labelled as Saint Clare (the latter the French spelling). The spelling was anglicized as early as the 1755 Mitchell Map, when the lake&#x27;s name was spelled as &quot;St. Clair,&quot; as it is currently.

The name is sometimes attributed to honoring the American Revolutionary War General Arthur St. Clair, who was President of the United States in Continental Congress during the drafting of the United States Constitution, and Governor of the Northwest Territory, but the name was in use with the current spelling long before St. Clair was a notable figure. The earlier name of the lake may have been conflated with that of the general when officials were later naming some of the political entities near the lake and the river, such as St. Clair County, St. Clair Township, and the cities of St. Clair and St. Clair Shores.

Some have thought that the name was in honor of Patrick Sinclair, a British officer who purchased land on the St. Clair River at the outlet of the Pine River. There in 1764 he built Fort Sinclair, which was in use for nearly twenty years before being abandoned.

==History==
St. Clair was first platted under the name of Palmer by Thomas Palmer in 1828. The city of St. Clair&#x27;s roots go back to 1764, when a British fort was built on the south side of the Pine River near where it flows into the St. Clair River. Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion had taken place the year before and the British wanted a military base on the St. Clair River to protect their shipping route between Detroit and Fort Michilimackinac. Col. Patrick Sinclair was given the task of building it. He also made the new Fort Sinclair a trading post and sawmill center. The fort and the trading post both operated for about twenty years.

In 1817, Robert Fulton platted a town on the north side of the Pine River. He lobbied for the creation of St. Clair County, and then convinced the state to make his settlement the new county seat. St. Clair remained the county seat until 1871, when it was moved to Port Huron.

Thomas Palmer of Detroit bought Fulton&#x27;s mostly undeveloped town in 1826, and for a time the village was called Palmer. The sawmill industry began to flourish due to the area&#x27;s large supply of pine and oak. Clay from the Pine River&#x27;s banks provided the material for several brickyards that operated into the Twentieth Century. Shipbuilding began in the 1820s and continued for a hundred years. Many of the town&#x27;s men became sailors on the Great Lakes and numerous captains built homes in the city. In 1887, the Diamond Crystal Salt Company began tapping the area&#x27;s vast underground salt deposits.

In the late 1800s, St. Clair became a well-known resort with the building of the luxurious Oakland Hotel in 1881 and the Somerville Hotel in 1888. In addition to the natural wonders of the area, both hotels offered mineral baths. Passenger steamers stopped daily at the hotel docks.

In the 1960s, the downtown area was redeveloped with the help of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The crown jewel of the project was the expansion of Palmer Park with its boardwalk along the St. Clair River.

==Industry==
*Cargill Salt (formerly Diamond Crystal) operates a large solution salt mine and evaporation facility in St. Clair. This is the only plant in the United States that produces Alberger salt, which is especially prized in the fast food industry because of its higher volume (due to its unique shape) and lower sodium content (for a given volume, not weight). This is part of Michigan&#x27;s large salt-mining industry.
*The St. Clair Power Plant and Belle River Power Plant are important industries to the area, although they are not within the city limits. Both plants are located a few miles south along the St. Clair River.

<text>St. Clair Township is a civil township of St. Clair County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 7,085 at the 2020 Census. The city of St. Clair is located near the southeast corner of the township.

==Communities==
*Rattle Run is an unincorporated community in the western part of the Township located at Gratiot Avenue and Rattle Run Road ( ; Elevation: 630 ft./192 m.).

==Naming==
Being situated on the western banks of the St. Clair River, the city&#x27;s name is taken from the river, which in turn was named for Lake Saint Clair. An expedition led by the French explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle named it &quot;Lac Sainte-Claire&quot;, because they entered the lake on August 12, 1679, the feast day of Saint Clare of Assisi. The lake is named on English maps as early as 1710 as Saint Clare. But as early as the Mitchell Map in 1755, the spelling is presented with the current spelling as St. Clair. The name is sometimes attributed as honoring the American Revolutionary War General and Governor of the Northwest Territory Arthur St. Clair, but the name was in use with the current spelling long before St. Clair was a notable figure. However it is possible that earlier name of the lake was conflated with that of the general in naming some of the political entities near the lake and the river, such as St. Clair County, St. Clair Township, and the cities of St. Clair and St. Clair Shores.

The origin of the name has also been confused with that Patrick Sinclair, a British officer who purchased land on the St. Clair River at the outlet of the Pine River. There, in 1764, he built Fort Sinclair, which was in use for nearly twenty years before being abandoned.

==History==
The Potawatomi and related Native Americans historically had villages along the St. Joseph River and other waterways. Several of their leaders signed the Treaty of Chicago, agreeing to cede much of their land in southwestern Michigan, Indiana and Ohio country.

The village was platted in 1831 at the Fawn River&#x27;s confluence with the St. Joseph River, where three European-American families had settled. A gristmill, the first in the county to run by water, had been built here in 1830.

It was first named Meeks Mill after Johnathon Meeks, who built the first grain mill. A Yankee from New York or New England, he moved to several other frontier areas, each time having a town named after him. When using names of classical figures later came into vogue, the village was renamed for the Roman emperor Constantine the Great.

The Main Street of town is a historic center with richly detailed, two-story commercial buildings of the late 19th century. It is designated US 131 through the village and connected to newer roads outside.

The fire department provides firefighting service along with medical first responder (MFR) services to the village and township of Constantine as well as the western half of Florence township. The department is also called station 4. This is because of the fire department numbering system in Saint Joseph county making them station #4.

There are currently 16 firefighters on the department of that 1 is part time, 2 are part time / paid on call, and the rest are paid on-call firefighters.

===Apparatus===

Engine 421 - Is a 1000 gallon rescue pumper. It is used for car accidents mostly and provides a second out pumper.

Tanker 416 - The tanker hold 3000 gallons of water and a small pump. Owing to the townships having no hydrants is a needed piece of equipment as structure fires need large volumes of water.

Brush 415 and 425 - With a large majority of the fire departments coverage area being rural also including the Three Rivers state game area wild land fires our a common occurrence. This requires the need of a 4x4 vehicle that can gain access to the woods and fields to extinguish the fires. Both of these units are based on pick up trucks and carry 250 gallons of water. They are both lifted and have 4 wheel drive to allow access to normally inaccessible areas for the larger fire trucks.

Rescue 413 - This truck is the main truck for physical type rescues. It is a rolling tool box. Its most common response is to car accidents as the unit carries the Jaws of Life.

Rescue 423 - This unit is used for medical responses. The truck is the most used in the department as medical type calls are the largest percentage of the call base. This unit responds along with an ambulance. As no ambulance is based in Constantine the fire department can normal be on scene long before an ambulance can be and start to provide aid to a sick or injured person. This truck also carries ice rescue equipment.

<text>Mendon is a village in St. Joseph County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The village is located within Mendon Township.

As of 2023, the estimated population is 868. The population was 870 at the 2010 census. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==History==

This area along the St. Joseph River was settled in the colonial period by French pioneers from Quebec and France. They traded with the Potawatomi and other Algonquian-speaking tribes of the area.

After United States acquisition of this territory following the American Revolution, settlers began to enter from eastern states in the early 19th century. The original county of St. Joseph was divided by Americans into townships. Mendon township was settled in 1831. The village of Mendon was platted in 1845.

On April 11, 1905, city activists who supported a public library received a matching construction grant from the Carnegie Foundation. They built the Mendon Township Library, which is one of the many Carnegie Libraries still in operation to this day.

Mendon is the home of two landmarks that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Marantette House was added to the list in 1973; it was built by an ethnic French man from Detroit who had traded with the Potawatomi at their settlement of Nottawaseepe.

* Vaudeway! (2017) The Showboat Chorus finds themselves enchanted by an evil wizard Forced into performing The music of Broadway and the sketch comedy of Vaudeville.
* SMILE! (2018) A gang of characters (loosely based on the Muppets), led by the charismatic Cermet T. Toad, come into the town of Mendon to remind the adults to smile. Featuring songs and skits about happiness.
* Lets Fake A Deal! (2019) A group of Ed Sullivan fanatics, finds themselves participating in a fast paced game show for the grand prize of One million dollars. Music all about the games we play and sketches written based on your favorite TV Game shows.

==History==
===Founding of the community===

In 1827, Judge John Sturgis came to the St. Joseph Valley area in southern Michigan territory and settled in what is now Sturgis. The original site of his home can be seen at Pioneer Park, maintained by the City of Sturgis. Legend has it that Sturgis was chosen as the town&#x27;s name because Mrs. John Sturgis baked a pan of biscuits and sent them to a surveying party near their cabin. Lewis Cass, who later became governor, was part of that surveying party. When the time came to name the town, Governor Cass remembered the biscuits and was insistent that the town be named Sturgis. In 1896, Sturgis officially became a city.

===Sturgis: the &quot;Electric City&quot;===
Sturgis is known as the &quot;Electric City&quot; due to its municipal electric utility and hydroelectric dam, which date back to the early days of the community. The City-owned electric department has served the Sturgis area since the city&#x27;s inception in 1896. In 1909, the City of Sturgis approved construction of a hydroelectric dam on the St. Joseph River near Centreville, Michigan. The dam began operation on September 3, 1911, and continues to serve the community. In 2011, the City celebrated the centennial of the Dam as part of &quot;Sturgis Dam Days.&quot;

===Sister City===
Sturgis is a Sister City to Wiesloch, Germany. In 1966, the cities of Wiesloch and Sturgis decided to form a Sister City partnership that grew out of President Eisenhower&#x27;s People-to-People program which was formed to increase cultural awareness and promote friendship. In 1967 Wiesloch formally began the cultural exchange by sending a community choir to Sturgis. In 1969 Sturgis reciprocated, sending its community choir to Wiesloch. In 1977, the exchange program was expanded to include students, who each year spend three weeks in their partner&#x27;s home. In 1989 a Sturgis teacher worked in Wiesloch as part of the Sister City program. This teacher exchange continues periodically as teachers from Wiesloch work in Sturgis and vice versa.

In 2016, Sturgis and Wiesloch celebrated the 50th Anniversary of their Sister City partnership.

===Kickoff city for Michigan Week===
For many years, in the third week of May, Sturgis served as the kickoff city for Michigan Week, a statewide celebration. Many prominent political figures walked in the parade annually. These included State Representatives and State Senators as well as the 6th District U.S. Representative and periodically the Governor of Michigan. With statewide celebration of Michigan Week waning, in 2010, Sturgis ended the tradition of holding the Michigan Week Kick-Off, opting to celebrate Sturgis Dam Days in June. Sturgis Dam Days was held in honor of the hydroelectric dam. The 100-year anniversary of the Sturgis Dam was celebrated at the Sturgis Dam Days in 2011. In 2012, the Sturgis community began celebrating Sturgis Fest during the last week in June.

===Sturgis Rail Depot===

On June 23–24, 2014, the historic Sturgis Rail Depot was moved from its location on West Main &amp; N. Clay Streets to a more central location on W. Chicago Road. The 120-year-old building, featuring masonry walls up to 2 feet thick and weighing 304 tons, was moved by Wolfe House &amp; Building Movers. The building was elevated by a Unified Jacking System and mounted on the Buckingham Dolly System for the quarter of a mile move across town.

The Depot underwent renovations to be used as a museum by the Sturgis Historical Society.

===Abbott plant for infant formula===

Abbott Laboratories produces infant formula at a plant in Sturgis. In February 2022, the plant was shut down due to bacteria in some of the infant formula produced there, which led to a nationwide shortage. The plant resumed production in June 2022 after receiving FDA clearance, first making specialty formula for infants with special dietary needs. The operations at the plant were a focus of an investigation launched by the House Oversight Committee.

The town was named after the local Potawatomi chief &quot;Wahbememe&quot;, which means White Pigeon. He was buried in the town, with a memorial stone marking his grave. This gravesite is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

According to legend, while he was at the gathering of the chiefs in Detroit, Wahbememe heard plans to attack the settlement which is now White Pigeon. The chief was a friend to the white settlers and did not want to see harm come to them, so he set out on foot and ran almost 150 miles to the settlement to warn the people.

<text>Caro is a city in and the county seat of Tuscola County, Michigan, United States. The population was 4,328 at the 2020 census and 4,145 at the 2000 census (an increase of 4.4%).

Caro is located northeast of Flint and east of Saginaw in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Thumb region.

== History ==


Caro was founded on the ridge just above the site of the Chippewa Village that early on stood at the Oxbow in the Cass River that was known by Native Americans as &quot;Pe-See-Kop-To-Qua-Yone.&quot; It is now the site of the Caro Dam in Section 10, Indianfields Township, Tuscola County. Caro would be built and organized on Section 3. On Section 10, at the gate of the Chippewa Village, the logging camp that started the &quot;boom&quot; in logging Cass River was established by Curtis Emerson in 1848. Paschel Richardson of Tuscola Village purchased land for logging on the future site of Caro or Section 3, Indianfields Township, also in 1848. The Johnson brothers, Daniel and Soloman, began to build the City of Zilwaukee, Michigan, from Cass River Pine timber that they logged from the land at the future site of Caro and that they bought in 1849. This was how the events would align.

Gardener and Ephraim Williams about 1830 to the 1840s were agents of the American Fur Company that had a trading post on the Cass River. The post was described as at the &quot;very short bend in the river.&quot; The bend was &quot;shaped like a horseshoe.&quot; It was called in rough English &quot;Skop-Ti-Qua-Nou.&quot; This was undoubtedly a slightly misspelled name for the Oxbow. Gardner Williams would purchase tracts of land next to the Chippewa Village in the 1850s that amounted in size to be more than what was the area of Caro.

Later Samuel P. Sherman would purchase in the north half of the northwest quarter of section 3 in Indianfields Township on September 8, 1852. Prior to this, only two land sales had been recorded, both for lumbering or speculative purposes. His son, William E. Sherman, had worked in the lumber industry nearby on the Cass River for some time prior to 1852 and William&#x27;s favorable report persuaded his father to visit in 1851 and afterward purchased several tracts of land in addition to his initial purchase.

In the 1856-57 session of the Michigan Legislature, construction of a road was authorized from Bridgeport in Saginaw County northeast to Forestville in Sanilac County, with a route that would pass through what is now Caro. Once the road was cleared, commercial interests began to locate here. Melvin Gibbs, who had been keeping a hotel in an old log house, in 1858 put up a new frame building, known as the Gibbs House. In 1859, William E. Sherman built another hotel, which he named the Centerville House, based on the location being near the center of the county. The name Centerville became associated with the developing community.

In 1865, Centerville was selected as the county seat. A post office named Tuscola Center was established on April 25, 1866. To address the confusion caused by the differing names, community leaders met in 1868, and at the suggestion of William E. Sherman selected the name Caro, based on a variant spelling of the Egyptian city of Cairo.

On July 23, 2007, Governor Jennifer Granholm announced Caro as a community chosen by the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) to take part in the Blueprints for Downtowns program. The city would receive a comprehensive, market-driven strategy toward developing an action-oriented downtown that would result in economic growth, job creation and private investments.

Caro residents voted in favor of changing to the status of a city on November 3, 2009. Village President Tom Striffler was elected to the position of mayor. Elected to the city council were Mike Henry, Rick Lipan, Joe Greene, Charlotte Kish, Amanda Langmaid, and Richard Pouliot.

==Early history==
The settlement of Fairgrove dates back to June 1852 when Amzy Clay bought acreage from Patrick McGlone of neighboring Juniata Township, Michigan. The land surrounding Fairgrove was level, sloping slightly to the northwest. The soil was ideal for farming, although many drainage projects were necessary to rid the area of its large mosquito population. Forest lands enclosed the township with stands of beech, maple, elm and basswood occurring in groves, giving the town its name. No roads into or out of the township existed at the time and Mr. Clay along with his father, Henry Clay, Jacob Winchell, Erastus A. Marr, David Gorter, a Mr. Blank, Patrick McGlone and Joseph R. McGlone hacked through five and a half miles of densely crowded forest to connect the new township with neighboring communities. Settlement did not begin in earnest until the following spring when several new families moved into the township.

Before the township was given a name it was designated as township 13 North, of Range 8 East by the State of Michigan. Three years later, on December 31, 1855, at a meeting of the board of supervisors the township was officially given the name of Fair Grove. The first school district organized for the township was the Hinson District, named for then resident D.P. Hinson. The first school house was built in the spring of 1856 and was run by Caroline E. Stoddard, of Rogers.

Fairgrove first received a post office in 1881 after a railroad was built here. It was incorporated in 1901.

<doc id="119184" wikidata="Q2681715" url="?curid=119184" title="Reese, Michigan">
<text>Reese is a village in Tuscola and Saginaw counties in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located almost entirely in Tuscola County&#x27;s Denmark Township, the village includes only a tiny portion of Blumfield Township in Saginaw County. The population was 1,454 at the 2010 census.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

== History ==

The area of what is the village of Reese today was first settled in 1865 when Mrs. Louisa Woodruff and her son built the first home (near the current intersection of Reese and Saginaw roads.) The Saginaw-Watrousville plank road was opened in 1871, which increased access to the community from Saginaw and the surrounding area. In 1873, the Detroit and Bay City railroads were built and Hudson B. Blackman plotted a tract of land adjacent to the original community (near the current intersection of Saginaw and Meridian streets) and named it Reese, in honor of Alvin H. Reese the railroad superintendent.

William B. Stark was born in 1831 in New York and came to Denmark, Tuscola County, in 1865. Six brothers and one sister came to live with him in the following years. They lived in tents in the dense forest of the area in what is now Camp Street. In 1873, William&#x27;s brother, Joseph, came to the area and opened a hotel near the corner of Reese and Saginaw roads. He was the fourth family to move to the area, with the others being his brother, the Woodruffs, and the Rogerses.

In the fall of 1865, A.W. Gates, a stage proprietor from Saginaw, established a plank road from East Saginaw, through Reese, and into Watrousville. In 1871, Gates established a mail and stage route along the plank road. Gates kept his express and stage offices in Rogers’ hotel. The post office was also in Rogers’ hotel. The post office was named Gates in 1871 after the man responsible for its establishment. In the fall of 1871, Daniel Woodruff opened a grocery and provision store across the street from the hotel, and George Melatt and Archie Scott opened a blacksmith shop. In September 1872, Asenath M. Rogers, Roberts’ wife, surveyed and platted eleven acres and called it Gates.
In 1873, G. W. Reese brought the Detroit &amp; Bay City Railroad through the town. Hudson B. Blackman then platted a tract of land adjoining Gates, and called it Reese, in honor of the railroad superintendent. The station, post office and town were then renamed after him. Thomas Haniford and Michael Doyle probably worked for that same railroad, and Eustius Gall, born in Switzerland, was an engineer. Blackman also donated the right–of–way and grounds on which the depot sat.

In 1875, Aseneth Rogers surveyed and platted an addition to the village of Gates. With the railroad station at the east end of town being called Reese, the post office of Gates at the west end eventually merged, the entire village and surrounding area becoming known as Reese. James N. Taylor, whom, according to the 1880 census was born in Virginia, served as postmaster from 1878 to at least 1883. In 1889, he and his family lost most of their possessions in a house fire.

In 1905 Gatestown was a common name of the west end of the community, still in use in 1915 and as late as 1940.

The village grew rapidly and within five years had a population of more than 300. In 1877, Reese was described as the railroad and trading point for a large section of farming country. Along with transporting people to and from the area the railroad would also transport timber, limestone and produce to markets throughout Michigan. In the early 1900s, the railroad also was used by local farmers to ship hogs and cattle to Detroit. Stages were also running daily from Saginaw to Caro. The depot served both railroads, as two train order boards were present. (One on a mast for the NYC and one on the building for the PM). Reese Crossing was not an interlocking but it was protected by a target that was set by approaching train crews. The east–west route is that of the Pere Marquette, and the north–south route going by the grain elevator is the Michigan Central branch line between Denmark Jct. and Bay City. The target was set vertical for a Michigan Central movement on the Denmark Jct. Branch.

In 1946, the C&amp;O Railway purchased the line. In 1985 the C&amp;O combined with B&amp;O to form CSX Transportation. In 1988, Huron and Eastern Railway purchased the rail line which is still in operation today. In 1993, Reese celebrated 120 years of rail service. Reese area farmers are one of the Huron &amp; Eastern Railway&#x27;s major shippers. Even today the farming success depends on efficient use of the rail system.

The first school meeting in the area was held in April 1866 and school was taught in a lumber shanty. There were 200 children of school age in the district. The original Reese School was built in 1880. The left side of the building was the original structure which was remodeled and increased in size in 1912. On April 25, 1913, a student set fire to the school and it burned to the ground. A new school was built in 1914 at a cost of $10,231. That structure remained, with renovations and additions, until it was torn down in 1962. it was replaced by the present middle school building which was erected from 1957 to 1966. In 1972, the gymnasium was refaced. At that time, the building housed both middle school and high school aged students. The present elementary school was built in 1957 and housed the lower grades. Total district enrollment was 1,308 students. The current Reese High School as built at a cost of $3,195,000 and opened for the 1976–77 school year housing grades 9–12. The middle school housed grades 6–8, with grades K-5 in the present elementary building. Total enrollment for the district was 1,358 students. The middle school closed at the end of the 2014–15 school year, with students moving into the high school building. RMS went up for sale in 2015 but after a year of no purchase agreements, it was demolished in 2016. There are also three parochial elementary schools that serve the district. In 1971, 44 teachers from the elementary and high school went on strike. After refusal to go back to work, the Reese Board of Education fired all 44. Reese 44 members were the first teachers in Michigan fired for demanding a fair contract by striking. This produced the phrase &quot;Remember the Reese 44&quot;.

The area continues to be largely agricultural. Corn, soybeans, navy beans, and sugar beets are the major crops produced. There is very little dairy or other livestock.

<text>Lawton is a village in southeastern Van Buren County, Michigan, United States. The population was 1,900 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The Village of Lawton came into existence in 1848 when the Michigan Central Railroad reached this destination. Nathan Lawton who the village is named after, was from Waterford, New York and had purchased property when it became available when Michigan received statehood. Upon the railroad reaching here in 1848, Mr. Lawton donated several acres of land for the construction of a depot that was originally named Paw Paw Station. In 1851 when a post office was being established the name of the town was named for Mr. Lawton. Though Nathan Lawton never lived here two of his sons, George and Charles moved here and made this town their home. 
Around 1860 a few local men including both of the Lawton brothers began experimenting with growing grapes. In 1868 A.B. Jones delivered the first grapes that were taken to market in Lansing MI. From there the grape industry took off and is now one of Southwest Michigan&#x27;s largest industries with several wineries in the area as well as a Welch Grape Juice Factory located in Lawton that has been part of Lawton since 1919.

*Henry Ford (1825–1894), Michigan state senator and Lawton village president (not to be confused with the industrialist Henry Ford)
*Charlie Maxwell Charles Richard Maxwell (1927–2024) was an American professional baseball outfielder who played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Boston Red Sox (1950–52, 1954), Baltimore Orioles (1955), Detroit Tigers (1955–62) and Chicago White Sox (1962–64). Lawton High School 1944, Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Chicago White Sox.

*W. Rae Young (October 30, 1915 – March 7, 2008) was one of the Bell Labs engineers that invented the cell phone.

The history of cellular phone technology began on December 11, 1947 with a Bell Labs internal memo written by Douglas H. Ring describing the idea of Rae Young of the hexagonal cell concept for a cellular mobile telephone system.[1]

Career
Young graduated from the University of Michigan in 1937 with a B.S. degree in electrical engineering. After graduation, Young began working at Bell Labs in what became his lifetime employment. Young did research and development for Bell Labs in the fields of radar, television, communication systems, and top-secret military systems. Young lived and worked in New York City for many years until he and his family moved to Summit, New Jersey from which he commuted by train to New York City.

During 1942 to 1945, Young worked on radar and communication systems for the US Armed Services. In 1945, Young began work on mobile radiotelephone systems in vehicles for coverage of urban areas and along highways. He developed systems for reducing interference between mobile systems that are closely spaced in frequency and location. Young served as chairman of a Radio Manufacturers Association (RMA) subcommittee TR8.9 on systems standards for mobile communications equipment.

In 1947, W. Rae Young proposed what are now called cell phones in a report to the RMA Systems Committee.[2] Coworker Douglas H. Ring at Bell Labs, liked Young&#x27;s idea about locating many mobile phone towers in a hexagonal cellular arrangement throughout each city so that every mobile phone user would be able to communicate from at least one cell through the telephone system. Douglas Ring credited W. Rae Young with suggesting the hexagonal cell layout and expanded on Rae Young&#x27;s concept in another internal Technical Memo dated 11 December 1947. In 1951, Young was appointed supervisor of the cellular systems engineering team and later became department head of cellular mobile phone development at Bell Labs.

In the 1950s, Young was transferred to another Bell Labs facility at Murray Hill, New Jersey where he worked on communications systems and formulated requirements for design of telephone switching systems and data-transmission systems. In 1962, he was transferred to another Bell Labs facility at Holmdel, New Jersey.

In 1964, W. Rae Young was made an IEEE Fellow “for contributions to mobile radio and data communications systems”.

After working for Bell Labs for 47 years, he retired in June 1979.

Family
Rae Young Jr. was born in Lawton, Michigan, a small rural town. He was the eldest of 4 children: 3 boys and a girl. Rae&#x27;s father William Rae Young Sr. was a medical doctor. Rae&#x27;s mother Elizabeth Emerson was also college educated and was descended from the Ralph Waldo Emerson family.

In February, 1937 Rae Young Jr. married Mary Lou Traywick (1915–1975) during their senior year at the University of Michigan. They had three children: Roy, Susan, and Barbara, each of whom earned a doctorate degree.

Rae Young Jr. played piano, clarinet, cello, and bass with the Summit Symphony Orchestra, New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, and the Monmouth Symphony Orchestra for over 40 years.

Rae&#x27;s wife Mary Lou died from cancer just before her 60th birthday.

In 1980, Rae met a widow Betty Wood, a retired crystallographer from Bell Labs. For the next 27 years Rae and Betty were constant companions until her death in March 2006. Rae was 92 when he died.

<text>Paw Paw is a village in and the county seat of Van Buren County, Michigan. The population was 3,362 as of the 2020 census.

==Overview==

The village is located at the confluence of the east and south branches of the Paw Paw River in the northeast portion of Paw Paw Township. Paw Paw was incorporated in 1837 and is located in the southwestern portion of Michigan, on Interstate 94 (I-94) approximately west of Kalamazoo. Paw Paw is named for the pawpaw trees which once grew along the Paw Paw River.

In 1832, Rodney Hinckley located a farm on the Paw Paw River. In that year, Pierce Barber also built a sawmill on the Paw Paw River at the west end of what became the village. In 1833, Peter Gremps and Lyman J. Daniels put the sawmill into business, and Gremps is considered the founder of the village of Paw Paw.

The town was the home of African American cookbook author Malinda Russell who published the first known cookbook by a black woman in the United States. She lived in Paw Paw after she fled her Tennessee home, which was raided by traveling gangs of whites in 1864. Her book &quot;Domestic Cook Book: Containing a Careful Selection of Useful Receipts for the Kitchen&quot;, as a means to provide income for her and her son and earn money to return to Greeneville, Tennessee. Russell self-published her book, in 1866, giving a brief history of her life and stating in the preface to it that she hoped to earn passage to return home from its proceeds. Within months of her publication, the town of Paw Paw was destroyed by fire.

On June 13, 1888, fire again erupted, destroying seven buildings (including 11 businesses and 2 lodges) in the village.

Paw Paw is in a rural location whose primary agricultural product is grapes, which are used both in the local Michigan wine industry and for juice and jellies. The St. Julian Winery and Warner&#x27;s Winery started in Paw Paw. Paw Paw has an annual Wine and Harvest Festival, which traditionally occurs the weekend following Labor Day. The Festival features a beer tent, bandstand, live music, a popular grape stomping competition among barefoot locals, carnival foods, and fireworks over scenic Maple Lake. For three days, the village opens up to celebrate its agricultural roots: its fruit-growing, juice, and wine-making industries. Activities in every corner of the village include the traditional grape stomping, wine tasting, 5K run, bicycle classic, and carnival midway, with new fun added each year.

The vignette &quot;Paw Paw for Jesus&quot; was featured on NPR&#x27;s &quot;This American Life&quot;.

*Kendall is an unincorporated community and the township seat. It is located between sections 22 and 27 at . The ZIP Code is 49062. It is named for Lucius B. Kendall, who settled there in 1864 and built up a successful company producing Barrel staves from the surrounding oak forests with a steam saw-mill. In 1870, Kendall was a principal player in pushing for the construction of a railroad line between Kalamazoo and South Haven through the town, which became a station on the South Haven division of the Michigan Central Railroad. A post office was also established in 1870, in which Kendall and his associates platted the village of Kendall. The Panic of 1873 ruined many of the businesses in town, causing a decline in population from a high of about 400 to about 250 in 1880.
*Mentha is a ghost town, formerly known as a major source for peppermint for the production of mint oil by the company of Albert M. Todd. It was located at .

*Pine Grove Mills is a small settlement about a mile east of Gobles. It was platted February 4, 1870, receiving a post office in 1857 with David D. Wise as postmaster. Now a private residence, the post office still stands today. The railroad extension from Kalamazoo reached Pine Grove Mills on January 10, 1870. The first buildings were simple log cabins, often with dirt floors. The first framed dwelling was erected in 1856 by Wise, Merrill &amp; Co. and was used for housing their employees. Lumber was the main industry in this locality, with farming supplanting it within the first few decades. Prominent early settlers include Daniel B. Brown, David Wise, Benjamin Deputy, David O. Everest and Chauncey Wise.

The Kal-Haven Trail runs through the township on a generally east–west line, going through Mentha, Kendall, Pine Grove Mills and Gobles.

On March 20, 1966, the Dexter area experienced &quot;one of the most infamous of all UFO sightings in history&quot; when local truck driver Frank Mannor spotted a glowing object near his home. Astronomer J. Allen Hynek visited Dexter and declared the Dexter mass sighting was probably caused by &quot;swamp gas,&quot; a term which has since become closely affiliated with UFO sightings. Hynek&#x27;s swamp gas theory prompted then-Michigan Congressman (and future president) Gerald R. Ford to call for a thorough Congressional investigation of &quot;the rash of reported sightings of unidentified flying objects in southern Michigan&quot;.

On March 15, 2012, Dexter was struck by a large EF3 tornado causing substantial damage to local houses and businesses, yet no injuries were reported.

<text>Manchester is a city in Washtenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 2,037 at the 2020 census. The city is located within Manchester Township.

Settled as early as 1833, Manchester incorporated as a village in 1867. On November 7, 2023, 66 percent of village residents voted in favor of incorporating Manchester as an autonomous city. Manchester officially became a city on November 15, 2023 with the mayor and city councilmembers sworn into office on November 20, 2023.

==History==
===Chicago Road===
In 1824 the United States Congress passed the General Survey Act, intended to create and maintain military roads through what was then the west of the country. One third of the funds allocated went to build a road between the strategic army posts of Detroit and Fort Dearborn, at the little town of Chicago. Known as the Chicago Road, it followed the old Sauk Trail and opened the entire area for settlement.

Also in 1824, the land around today&#x27;s Manchester was surveyed by John Mack, who noted it as being &quot;a good mill seat.&quot; John Gilbert, who had recently completed work on sections of the Erie Canal, agreed with John Mack, and on May 10, 1826 he purchased of land along the Raisin River at that location.

===Early village history===
Originally from upstate New York, John Gilbert resettled to Ypsilanti, Michigan, in 1831. In 1832, he decided to turn his attention to the extensive land tracts he held in the area. He commissioned the construction of a grist mill along the River Raisin upon the land he had purchased in 1826. The original plat of the village of Manchester was prepared by surveyor Hiram Burnham and dated 1833, but was not formally filed until March 25, 1835. The location was chosen to take advantage of water power from the river and named after Manchester, New York.

===Soulesville===
In 1833, James Soule purchased a large tract of land about downstream from Manchester. He built a small settlement he named Soulesville. Though the two settlements initially competed against each other, on March 16, 1867, both settlements were incorporated into the village of Manchester. The Manchester Village Office and Manchester Public Library are located on the site of the former settlement.

<text>Saline ( &quot;&quot;) is a city in Washtenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 8,948 at the 2020 census. The city borders Saline Township to the southwest, and the two are administered autonomously.

==History==

Before the 18th century, Native Americans traveled to what is now Saline to hunt wildlife and gather salt from the salt springs they found nearby. In the 18th century, French explorers canoed up to the area and also harvested the salt. They named the local river &quot;Saline&quot; (&quot;salty&quot;). Europeans settled the area in the 19th century, most of them from England and Germany. Together with Orange Risdon, a government surveyor generally considered the city&#x27;s founder, the residents named the town Saline, which was officially established in 1832. In 1870 railroad service, provided by the Detroit-Hillsdale-&amp;-Indiana Railroad, first reached Saline. In 1875 Salinians built one of the city&#x27;s most famous landmarks, the Second-Empire frame, -story residential building, the Davenport House, a.k.a. Curtis Mansion. The town continued to grow, and in 1931 the Village of Saline became the City of Saline. The Saline Fisheries Research Station was built on the site of a pioneer grist mill. Saline has had its own newspaper since ca. 1874 but the &quot;Saline Reporter&quot; was shuttered by its owner, Digital First Media, in 2014. The &quot;Saline Post&quot;, an independent outlet, now serves the community.

The city is popular for its annual Celtic Festival, which attracts people from all over the U.S. and its sister cities Brecon, Wales, United Kingdom (established 1966) and Lindenberg, Germany (established 2003).

==Communities==
* Delhi Mills is an unincorporated community located within the township at . The community was first platted in 1836 by Jacob Doremus under the name Michigan Village. It was soon known as Delhi. In 1842, all unsold plots of land were bought by Norman Goodale, who founded the Delhi Mills company. Scio transferred its post office to Delhi Mills, and the post office operated from February 3, 1871, until September 30, 1903. The area is now part of Delhi Metropark along the Huron River. 
* Scio is an unincorporated community located in the northern portion of the township at . The settlement began with the construction of a mill by Samuel Foster in 1835. Scio, which was named after the township, was platted later that year, and a post office opened on September 9, 1835. The office operated until February 3, 1871, until it closed and transferred to Delhi Mills. Another post office was reestablished in Scio on September 26, 1871. 
* Weinsburg is a former settlement founded by German Lutheran farmers within the township in 1890. Weinsburg had its own post office from January 30, 1890, until May 15, 1901.

==History==
Samuel W. Foster bought a mill site on the Huron River at what is now Scio in 1835. The community was platted by Dr. Cyril Nichols from Vermont. A post office was established in 1835. The office was moved to Delhi Mills and renamed in February 1871, though the Scio office was re-established in September 1871. The post office took its name from the township; however, early township records were destroyed by fire, and it is uncertain why &quot;Scio&quot; was chosen. There are at least three origins suggested for the name. The first suggests it derives from the Greek island of Chios, and the second that it was named after Scio, New York, although that town was also named for Chios. Thirdly, by coincidence &quot;scio&quot; also means &quot;I know&quot; in Latin, so following the American Civil War some people assumed this was the origin of the name.

Documents regarding the naming of townships in the State of Michigan archives indicate that Scio Township and its northern neighbor Webster Township were named on the same date, unlike other townships in Washtenaw County. This date followed the establishment by the United States of America of diplomatic relations with the modern nation of Greece, following the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830). U.S. Senator Daniel Webster had introduced a resolution, recorded in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, that is widely considered one of his better orations (printed in the &quot;Collected Works of Daniel Webster&quot;). He advocated that the USA be the first nation to diplomatically recognize Greece. Webster referred to the 1822 destruction of Scio, the then-current French translation of Chios (, pronounced /ˈçio̞s/), derived from the Genoese dialect. In Webster&#x27;s era, French was the language of international diplomacy. Eugène Delacroix&#x27;s 1824 painting &quot;The Massacre at Chios&quot; and numerous publications brought the Greek cause to the attention of Americans. Ypsilanti Township was named after the first leader of the secret organization that coordinated the beginning of the revolution, Alexander Ypsilanti (). The City of Ypsilanti was named after the victor of the final battle of the revolution, Alexander&#x27;s brother Demetrius. The sister townships of Scio and Webster were named as a monument to the birth of the new Greek republic, the end of its citizen&#x27;s subjection, and the first American senator to support their nation.

Delhi Mills was platted as &quot;Michigan Village&quot; by Jacob Doremus in 1836, but was renamed Delhi. In 1842, Norman C. Goodale, known as the founder of Delhi Mills, acquired all the unsold lots. The Scio post office was transferred here in 1871 and operated until 1903.

==Geography==

<text>Belleville is a city in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A western suburb of Detroit, Belleville is located roughly southwest of downtown Detroit, and southeast of Ann Arbor, and is completely surrounded by Van Buren Township. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 3,991.

Belleville Lake is the city&#x27;s principal geographic feature, and the city is also home to the National Strawberry Festival.

==History==
The community was named in honor of landowner James Bell by adroitly choosing the French word for &quot;beautiful town&quot;. The hamlet was platted in 1847 with the main thoroughfares still used today designated Main, Liberty, and High Street. About 1881, the Belleville depot on the Detroit line of the Wabash Railroad began serving travelers from across the region and the country.

Belleville was established as a village in 1905, when its governance separated from Van Buren Township by an act of the State Legislature. Located on the Huron River which was a natural trade route, the village had long been a thriving center for lumber businesses with saw mills located along the shores of the river. The large expanses of woodlands were removed to make way for farmland, industry and increasing population.

To generate more electrical power in the region, in early 1926 the Detroit Edison Company built the French Landing Dam on the river east of Belleville, thereby creating Belleville Lake. Belleville Lake is the largest inland lake in Wayne County, stretching 6 miles and covering 1,200 acres. The traditional downtown is nestled on the southern shore of Belleville Lake. Belleville achieved city status on 14 May 1946.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (5.00%) is water.

Belleville Lake was created by damming the Huron River when the French Landing Dam and Powerhouse was built in 1925 in neighboring Van Buren Township.

<doc id="119244" wikidata="Q10748438" url="?curid=119244" title="Brownstown Charter Township, Michigan">
<text>Brownstown Charter Township is a charter township in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Its population was 33,194 at the 2020 census. Brownstown was established in 1827, a decade prior to Michigan&#x27;s admission to the Union.

Brownstown has three separate but connected segments due to the incorporation of the cities of Flat Rock, Rockwood, and Woodhaven in the early 1960s.

==History==
Prior to the township&#x27;s organization, the area was involved in the War of 1812, and the battles of Brownstown and Maguaga took place in the area.

The region now known as Brownstown was, like surrounding areas in Michigan, once a part of the French colony of New France (Mid France). The area eventually fell into hands of the British and finally came under American rule in the 18th century. The original area of land south of Detroit was designated a township by the Michigan Territorial Council on April 5, 1827, when Moses Roberts was elected its first supervisor. This made Brownstown one of Wayne County&#x27;s nine original townships.

Research from local historians has found that the township was named for Adam Brown, who was kidnapped by the Wyandot Indians. Brown was raised by the Wyandots, married a native woman, and grew to become a tribal leader. As time passed, settlements spread out from the lakeshore to begin changing the swampy, sandhill countryside into productive farmland. Established in 1893, Kurtzhals Farm is one of the largest remaining farms in the township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which (27.58%) are covered by water.

The township is divided into three different segments. The Huron River forms the southernmost boundary of the township with Berlin Charter Township in Monroe County. The southernmost point of the Detroit River is within the township, which leads to Lake Erie. Brownstown borders the cities of Flat Rock, Gibraltar, Riverview, Rockwood, Southgate, and Taylor, as well as touching corners with the cities of Romulus and Trenton. Huron Charter Township borders to the west. Brownstown shares a water boundary with Grosse Ile Township and across the international border with the city of Amherstburg in Ontario.

==Demographics==

The median income for a household was $55,239 and for a family was $65,544. Males had a median income of $50,246 versus $29,614 for females. The per capita income for the township was $22,523. About 5.7% of families and 6.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.3% of those under 18 and 7.4% of those 65 or over.

The population of Brownstown Township was 30,627. The racial and ethnic makeup of the population was 79.0% non-Hispanic white, 8.6% Black or African-American, 0.4% Native American, 5.2% Asian, 0.1% non-Hispanics of some other race, 2.1% reporting two or more races and 5.2% Hispanic or Latino.

<text>Canton Township (commonly known simply as Canton) is a charter township in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A western suburb of Detroit, Canton is located roughly west of downtown Detroit, and east of Ann Arbor. As of the 2020 census, the township had a population of 98,659, making it Michigan&#x27;s second most-populated township (after Clinton Township) and ninth most-populated municipality overall.

The township is ranked as the 96th highest-income place in the United States with a population of 50,000 or more and is also consistently ranked as one of the safest cities in the state and nation. In 2015, the township was ranked as the 29th safest city in Michigan.

==Communities==
*Canton is an unincorporated community within the township, although the name often refers to the whole township itself. It is located just south of M-153 (Ford Road) at . The Canton post office, first established in 1852, serves an area conterminous with the township itself—using the 48187 ZIP Code north of Cherry Hill Road and the 48188 ZIP Code to the south.
*Cherry Hill is an unincorporated community in the western portion of the township at . Centered along the intersection of Cherry Hill Road and Ridge Road, it is the site of a new urbanist neighborhood, as well as containing numerous original historic structures. 
*Hoffman was a historic settlement located west of the city of Wayne within Canton Township in 1880.
*Sheldon (or Sheldon&#x27;s Corners) is an unincorporated community in the southern portion of the township on U.S. Highway 12 just west of Interstate 275 at . Named after early settler Perry Sheldon, the community dates back to 1825 and predates the creation of Canton Township. That year, Timothy and Rachel Sheldon built the Sheldon Inn, which stood until it was demolished in 2021. A post office under the name Canton operated here from January 24, 1852, until it was transferred on March 17, 1857. Sheldon also contained a depot along the Michigan Central Railroad. The community itself is a designated Michigan State Historic Site and also contains the Territorial Road historic marker.

==History==
Earlier, on October 20, 1829, the legislature had passed a bill creating the townships of Lima and Richland out of Bucklin Township. Governor Lewis Cass returned the acts unapproved, citing a conflict under the law. The names conflicted with post offices in existence, contrary to a territorial law from April 12, 1827, prohibiting incorporation of a new township bearing the same name as any existing post office. The legislature thus had to substitute the names of Nankin and Pekin after the cities of Nanjing (Nanking) and Beijing (Peking) in China. The name of Pekin was extinguished when it was renamed Redford in 1833.

The Township of Canton was created by act of the Michigan Territorial Legislature on March 7, 1834, out of a southern portion of Plymouth Township. It was named in honor of the port and provincial capital known historically as Canton, Imperial China, known today from the pinyin standard as Guangzhou.

The first meeting to organize the township was held in April 1834.

In the summer of 2002, the emerald ash borer was discovered in Canton, eventually infesting the Great Lakes region.

The Canton Historical Society and Museum opened in 1982 in a one-roomed schoolhouse.

On August 24, 2023 an EF-0 tornado hit Canton around 10:20 PM.
