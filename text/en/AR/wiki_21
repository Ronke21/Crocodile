<text>Shrewsbury (/ˈʃruzberi/ &quot;SHROOZ-bury&quot;) is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 38,325 according to the 2020 United States Census, in nearly 15,000 households.

Incorporated in 1727, Shrewsbury prospered in the 19th century due to its proximity to Worcester, and from visitors to Lake Quinsigamond. The town is governed under the New England representative town meeting system, headed by the Town Manager and five-member elected Select Board.

==History==
The Town of Shrewsbury, named for Shrewsbury, England, is a community with an uneven and hilly terrain cut by a number of minor streams providing several small water power sites. Grants of land were made in what would eventually be the town beginning in 1664, with the grant called Haynes Farm as the largest. In 1664 Native American leader, Peter Jethro, and other Nipmuc Indians deeded land around Lake Quinsigamond to settlers in the area. Settlers came primarily from Sudbury and Marlborough, and the first permanent settler was Gersham Wheelock in 1720. As a town, Shrewsbury was first settled in 1722 and officially incorporated in 1727.

Townspeople created an agricultural economy with apple orchards, and by 1750, there were two stores and four taverns as well as several small industries in operation. The rapid fall of prices for agricultural goods, the shortage of hard currency, and the general economic depression following the Revolutionary War produced disastrous conditions for colonists. Shays&#x27; Rebellion in 1786 sought to close the courts to prevent debt collections and the foreclosure of mortgages. Shrewsbury became a staging area for the rebellion and the encampment of the more than 400 insurgents, before the march on the Worcester Court House.

A leather industry began in 1786 in Shrewsbury, and town farmers developed large cattle herds to support the manufacture of boots and shoes. This was followed by the establishment of gunsmithing operations in 1797, which produced rifles, shotguns and pistols and eventually cutlery. Luther Goddard began in 1809 by making brass clocks and then established a small watch factory employing a few skilled Swiss and English watchmakers. Lumbering created sawmills, and they in turn drew chair and cabinet makers, plow and wagon builders.

The development of streetcar routes in the 19th century propelled the growth of single-family housing in town. A summer resort population on Lake Quinsigamond became consumers of the market garden produce grown by town farmers. As Shrewsbury&#x27;s industry was killed by the lack of large waterpower sites and the tardy arrival of the railroad, its role as a suburb of Worcester grew more important. The town&#x27;s population doubled from 1915 to 1940 as continued streetcar suburb growth brought more modern settlers into the community. Other modern developments included an increased number of lakeside cottages, ethnic clubs and recreational areas on the lake.

The 1953 Worcester tornado came through the Shrewsbury area, killing twelve people and causing extensive damage.

Since the late 20th century, Shrewsbury and neighboring Westborough have seen a large influx of immigration from South Asia, particularly India.

<text>Southborough is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. It incorporates the villages of Cordaville, Fayville, and Southville. Its name is often informally shortened to Southboro, a usage seen on many area signs and maps. At the 2020 census, its population was 10,450 in 3,542 households.

As of 2021, 43% of land use was residential, with 35% open space, including one-tenth of the town&#x27;s area that is flooded by the Sudbury Reservoir.

==History==
Southborough was first settled in 1660 and was officially incorporated in July 1727. Southborough was primarily a farming community until mills began to tap the small rivers that ran through the town. By the end of the 19th century, Southborough was home to the manufacture of plasters, straw bonnets, boots, and shoes, among other things.

In 1727, Southborough split off as the &quot;south borough&quot; of Marlborough, much as Westborough had split off from Marlborough in 1717, ten years before.

In 1898, the Fayville Dam was constructed to produce several reservoirs to supply a growing Boston with water. As a result, manufacturing vanished, and Southborough did not see substantial growth until the high-tech boom of the 1970s.

The Fay, Burnett, and Choate families had major impacts on the development of the town as it is today. St. Mark&#x27;s Church, St. Mark&#x27;s School, the Southborough Library, the Community House, and the Fay School were all built at least in part through the efforts of these families.

<text>Sterling is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 7,985 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Previous to its incorporation, it was &quot;the Second Parish of Lancaster.&quot; It was commonly called by a portion of its Indian name, Chocksett. There was an Indian fort and graveyard located between East Waushacum Pond and West Waushacum Pond. Sagamore Sam, a Nashaway sachem and insurgent during King Philip&#x27;s War, was from Waushacum.

The Nipmuc minister, Peter Jethro, worked in the area in the 1670s. The original Indian name of the area was Woonsechocksett. The land encompassing the Chocksett region was not originally included in the first land sold by the great Indian Chief Sholan to the settlers of the Lancaster grant. However, Sholan&#x27;s nephew Tahanto would eventually sell the Chocksett land to the inhabitants of Lancaster in 1713.

The first white settlers arrived in Chocksett seven years later, in 1720, formerly inhabitants of Lancaster proper. Among these first settlers were families such as Beman, Sawyer, Houghton, and Osgood – names reflected to this day in the names of Sterling&#x27;s oldest roads.

A short time after settlement, in 1733, the residents of the Chocksett area requested its own incorporation, separate from Lancaster, due to the &quot;great inconvenience&quot; of a long distance to the church in Lancaster&#x27;s center. This request was denied. However, by 1780 the population of Chocksett was so numerous as to constitute a majority. So the voters of the area voted out the existing Lancaster town officers and began to conduct town business and meetings in Chocksett. This was enough to convince the rest of Lancaster that it was now time for Chocksett, the Second Parish of Lancaster, to go its own way.

In 1781, Chocksett was incorporated as its own town: Sterling. The town derives its name from General William &quot;Lord Stirling&quot; Alexander, who served valiantly under Gen. George Washington in the New York and other campaigns. His portrait hangs in the town hall, and the town commemorated Alexander with a medallion during its bicentennial celebration in 1981. A duplicate portrait resides in the town hall of New Windsor, NY.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.42%, is water.

Interstate 190 cuts Sterling in half. Sterling is also crossed by Massachusetts Route 12, Massachusetts Route 62, Massachusetts Route 140, and Massachusetts Route 110.

Sterling is bordered by Leominster to the north, West Boylston to the south, Princeton and Holden to the west, Lancaster to the northeast, and Clinton and Boylston to the southeast. Sterling borders Boylston on the Wachusett Reservoir.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 7.985 people and 3,248 households in the town. The population density was . The median value of owner-occupied housing units was $372,400. The racial makeup of the town was 95.7% White, 1.2% African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.4% Asian, and 1.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.3% of the population.

21.7% were under the age of 18, and 20.2% were 65 years of age or older. The population was 52.4% female.

The median income for a household in the town was $119,000. The per capita income for the town was $59,851. About 1.8% of the population was below the poverty line.

==Government==
===Taxes===
Residents of Sterling pay property taxes on real estate and certain other personal items, such as unregistered vehicles. The value of taxable property is determined by the town Board of Assessors. In 2023, the tax rate was $14.30 for one thousand dollars of valuation. Although the tax rate consistently decreased from 2016 to 2023, average bills have increased due to changes in valuation.

==Library==

The Sterling public library began in 1871. The Conant Public Library building, financed by Edwin Conant in memory of his daughter Elizabeth Ann Conant, was dedicated in 1886. In fiscal year 2008, the town of Sterling spent 1.59% ($289,567) of its budget on its public library—approximately $36 per person, per year ($47.44 adjusted for inflation to 2022). The Conant Library building closed in 2002 so it could be renovated. During this time, the library was temporarily moved to the Old Town Hall. The renovation was finished in 2004, and the library returned to its original location.

==Education==

Sterling is part of the Wachusett Regional School District. Students between Grades K–4 attend Houghton Elementary School, while students between Grades 5–8 attend Chocksett Middle School. Most Sterling residents attend Wachusett Regional High School in Holden for high school. Some Sterling residents, however, can attend Montachusett Regional Vocational Technical School in Fitchburg.

==Utilities==
Sterling provides town water to many residents, although the more rural parts of town remain on private wells. The source of town water is six groundwater wells located on Redemption Rock Trail and Worcester Road. All public wells use an ultraviolet light purification system. In 2010, town water supply was affected by high bacteria levels, including detection of E. coli, and residents were advised to boil water until the situation was resolved.

There are no town sewer services, and all houses have private septic systems.

The town also offers curbside trash and recycling pickup for no additional fee. The town recycling center at the Sterling Department of Public Works closed permanently on July 1, 2015. Residents may use the Wachusett Watershed Regional Recycling Center in West Boylston, MA to drop off recycling and larger bulk items.

Sterling is one of 41 communities in the state that has its own municipal electric light company. The Light Department works under the direction and control of three elected Commissioners who serve rotating 3 year terms. The Light Board hires a Manager who runs day-to-day operations.

In fall of 2016, Sterling Municipal Light Department broke ground on the &quot;first utility-scale energy storage facility in Massachusetts&quot;, which can, in the case of an electric outage, power the emergency dispatch center and police station for up to twelve days. The battery storage also helps the town save money on peak power charges from the grid operator. The award-winning project has generated considerable interest, attracting international visitors from Europe and Asia. In the aftermath of the devastating 2017 hurricanes Irma and Maria in the Caribbean, the microgrid project has been cited as a model of designing and building power infrastructure for resiliency in disaster situations.

Eversource provides natural gas service in Sterling.

==History==
A Nipmuc, John Wampas, visited England in 1627 and deeded land in the Sutton area to Edward Pratt, who later sold interests to others. Competing claims involving the Nipmucs led to a Massachusetts General Court case in 1704, which granted Pratt and fellow proprietors an eight-mile-square section of land, which is now Sutton.

Three families were the first to settle in Sutton, namely those of Elisha Johnson, Nathaniel Johnson, and Benjamin Marsh, who is credited as a founder of the town and the First Baptist Church of Sutton. In 1717, The Great Snow completely buried structures their home cabins. According to accounts, a local Indigenous peoples of the Americas Indigenous person rescued the Johnson family by noticing smoke from their chimney through the snow. Marsh served in several capacities for the town including as a selectman and moderator. He also served as elder and pastor from 1737 until his death in 1775.

In 1737, the Edward Putnam House, one of the oldest homes in Sutton, was built by its namesake and cousin of the military officer Rufus Putnam. The house is featured on the town seal.

On September 26, 1777, Holman&#x27;s Regiment of Militia was called up in Sutton during the American Revolutionary War.

Since 1962, the Pleasant Valley Country Club has hosted a number of notable Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America tournaments such as the Booz Allen Classic, the Lady Carling Eastern Open, and the New England Classic. The 1968-67 and 1970-74 Women&#x27;s PGA Championship took place at Pleasant Valley. From 1965 to 1973, golfer Paul Harney worked there.

In 1984, Vaillancourt Folk Art, noted makers of chalkware, was established in Sutton.

<text>Upton is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. It was first settled in 1728. The population was given as exactly 8,000 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Upton was originally the home of the Nipmuc, who inhabited most of central Massachusetts. The town was first settled in 1728. Residents in outlying areas of surrounding towns were finding it difficult to fulfil the obligation to attend church every Sunday, so they petitioned the state for creation of a new town central to their homes, and in 1735 Upton was incorporated, taking land from Hopkinton, Mendon, Uxbridge, and Sutton.

Upton was home to a number of members of the Taft family, including an American Revolutionary War soldier named Samuel Taft, who was born there. Samuel Taft had 22 children and hosted President George Washington on his inaugural tour of New England in 1789. Three-term mayor of Worcester, historian Judge Henry Chapin was born here on May 13, 1811.

Between 1730 and 1850, Upton had many small shoe shops, called ten–footers. These operations were gradually merged into large assembly-line manufacturing companies. By 1837, Upton produced 21.7% of the boots made in Worcester County.

William Knowlton founded what was to become the world&#x27;s largest women&#x27;s hat factory: Knowlton Hat Factory was built in 1872 and added to the National Historic Register in 1982.

The Upton Fire Department was incorporated at Town Meeting on April 9, 1839, and has served Upton and its residents faithfully for 175 years

In 2018, the town, led by the Economic Development Committee, began the process of redeveloping its downtown area. This is expected to be a decade-long project involving a public-private partnership and anchored by a new community center.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and (0.97%) is water.

The northwestern section of Upton, including the area surrounding Warren Brook, has become known as Forest Green by locals due to the lush rolling hills that can be seen from Fowler Street and Mechanic Street.

==Community Center==
The Upton Town Library was founded in March 1871, and was until 2023 housed at a converted church downtown.
After a 20-year effort, built using a $12 million bond approved at the 2021 Town Meeting and subsequent election, the new Upton Community Center was opened on May 1, 2023. It combines a new library building, a new senior center, a refurbished children&#x27;s playground, and a number of meeting rooms and study areas.

==Education==
===Public schools===
Memorial Elementary School and Nipmuc Regional High School are part of the public school system of the Mendon-Upton Regional School District.

Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational Technical High School is a trade school also open to the nearby towns of Northbridge, Grafton, Bellingham, Uxbridge, Millville, Sutton, Milford, Hopedale, Blackstone, Douglas and Mendon.

<text>Uxbridge is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States, first colonized in 1662 and incorporated in 1727. It was originally part of the town of Mendon, and named for the Earl of Uxbridge. The town is located southwest of Boston and south-southeast of Worcester, at the midpoint of the Blackstone Valley National Historic Park. The historical society notes that Uxbridge is the &quot;Heart of The Blackstone Valley&quot; and is also known as &quot;the Cradle of the Industrial Revolution&quot;. Uxbridge was a prominent Textile center in the American Industrial Revolution. Two Quakers served as national leaders in the American anti-slavery movement. Uxbridge &quot;weaves a tapestry of early America&quot;.

Indigenous Nipmuc people near &quot;Wacentug&quot; or “Waentug” (river bend), deeded land to 17th-century settlers. Uxbridge reportedly granted rights to America&#x27;s first colonial woman voter, Lydia Taft, and approved Massachusetts first women jurors. The first hospital for mental illness in America was reportedly established here. Deborah Sampson posed as an Uxbridge soldier, and fought in the American Revolution. A 140-year legacy of manufacturing military uniforms and clothing began with 1820 power looms. Uxbridge became famous for woolen cashmeres. &quot;Uxbridge Blue&quot;, was the first US Air Force Dress Uniform. BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club distribution warehouse is a major employer today.

Uxbridge had a population of 14,162 at the 2020 United States Census.

== History ==
=== Colonial era, Revolution, Quakers, and abolition ===
John Eliot started Nipmuc Praying Indian villages. Several praying Indian towns included Waentug (or Wacentug) and “Rice City” (later settled as Mendon.) “Great John”, sold Squimshepauk plantation to settlers in September of 1663, &quot;for 24 pound Ster&quot;. Mendon began in 1667, and burned in King Phillips War. Nipmuck joined the native uprising, and many died. Western Mendon became Uxbridge in 1727, and Farnum House held the first town meeting. John Adams’ uncle, Nathan Webb, was the first called minister of the colony&#x27;s first new Congregational church in the Great Awakening. The American Taft family origins are intertwined with Uxbridge and Mendon. Lydia Taft reportedly voted in the 1756 town meeting, considered as a first for colonial women.

Seth and Joseph Read and Simeon Wheelock joined Committees of Correspondence. Baxter Hall was a Minuteman drummer. Seth Read fought at Bunker Hill. Washington stopped at Reed&#x27;s tavern, en route to command the Continental Army. Samuel Spring was one of the first chaplains of the American Revolution. Deborah Sampson enlisted as &quot;Robert Shurtlieff of Uxbridge&quot;. Shays&#x27; Rebellion also began here, and Governor John Hancock quelled Uxbridge riots. Simeon Wheelock died protecting the Springfield Armory. Seth Reed was instrumental in adding &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; to U.S. coins. Washington slept here on his Inaugural tour while traveling the Middle Post Road.

Quakers including Richard Mowry migrated here from Smithfield, Rhode Island, and built mills, railroads, houses, tools and Conestoga wagon wheels. Southwick&#x27;s store housed the Social and Instructive Library. Friends Meetinghouse, next to Moses Farnum&#x27;s farm, had prominent abolitionists Abby Kelley Foster and Effingham Capron as members. Capron led the 450 member local anti-slavery society. Brister Pierce, formerly a slave in Uxbridge, was a signer of an 1835 petition to Congress demanding abolition of slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia. Local influences from the First and Second Great Awakenings can be seen with the early Congregational and Quaker traditions.

=== Early transportation, education, public health and safety ===
The Tafts built the Middle Post Road&#x27;s Blackstone River bridge in 1709. &quot;Teamsters&quot; drove horse &quot;team&quot; freight wagons on the Worcester-Providence stage route. The Blackstone Canal brought horse-drawn barges to Providence through Uxbridge for overnight stops. The &quot;crossroads village&quot; was a junction on the Underground Railroad. The P&amp;W Railroad ended canal traffic in 1848.

A 1732 vote &quot;set up a school for ye town of Uxbridge&quot;. A grammar school was followed by 13 one-room district school houses, built for $2000 in 1797. Uxbridge Academy (1818) became a prestigious New England prep school.

Uxbridge voted against the smallpox vaccine. Samuel Willard treated smallpox victims, was a forerunner of modern psychiatry, and ran the first hospital for mental illness in America. Vital records recorded many infant deaths, the smallpox death of Selectman Joseph Richardson, &quot;Quincy&quot;, &quot;dysentary&quot;, and tuberculosis deaths. Leonard White recorded a malaria outbreak here in 1896 that led to firsts in the control of malaria as a mosquito-borne infection. Uxbridge led Massachusetts in robberies for a quarter of the year in 1922, and the town voted to hire its first nighttime police patrolman. Peter Emerick summarized the history of policing in Uxbridge.

=== Industrial era: 19th century to late 20th century ===
Bog iron and three iron forges marked the colonial era, with the inception of large-scale industries beginning around 1775. Examples of this development can be seen in the work of Richard Mowry, who built and marketed equipment to manufacture woolen, linen, or cotton cloth, and gristmills, sawmills, distilleries, and large industries. Daniel Day built the first woolen mill in 1809. By 1855, 560 local workers made of cloth (). Uxbridge reached a peak of over twenty different industrial mills. A small silver vein at Scadden, in southwest Uxbridge, led to unsuccessful commercial mining in the 1830s.

Innovations included power looms, vertical integration of wool to clothing, cashmere wool-synthetic blends, &quot;wash and wear&quot;, yarn spinning techniques, and latch hook kits. Villages included mills, shops, worker housing, and farms. Wm. Arnold&#x27;s Ironstone cotton mill, later made Kentucky Blue Jeans, and Seth Read&#x27;s gristmill, later housed Bay State Arms. Hecla and Wheelockville housed American Woolen, Waucantuck Mill, Hilena Lowell&#x27;s shoe factory, and Draper Corporation. Daniel Day, Jerry Wheelock, and Luke Taft used water-powered mills. Moses Taft&#x27;s (Central Woolen) operated continuously making Civil War cloth.

North Uxbridge housed Clapp&#x27;s 1810 cotton mill, Chandler Taft&#x27;s and Richard Sayles&#x27; Rivulet Mill, the granite quarry, and Rogerson&#x27;s village. Crown and Eagle Mill was &quot;a masterpiece of early industrial architecture&quot;. Blanchard&#x27;s granite quarry provided curb stones to New York City, the Statue of Liberty and regional public works projects. Peter Rawson Taft&#x27;s grandson, William Howard Taft, visited Samuel Taft House.

John Sr., Effingham and John W. Capron&#x27;s mill pioneered US satinets and woolen power looms. Charles A. Root, Edward Bachman, and Harold Walter expanded Bachman-Uxbridge, and exhibited leadership in women&#x27;s fashion. The company manufactured US Army uniforms for the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the nurse corps, and the first Air Force dress uniforms, dubbed &quot;Uxbridge Blue&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine covered Uxbridge Worsted&#x27;s proposed buyout to be the top US woolen company. The largest plant of one of the largest US yarn companies, Bernat Yarn, was located here from the 1960s to the 1980s. A historic company called Information Services operated from Uxbridge, and managed subscription services for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, among other publications, in the later 20th century.

=== Late 20th century to present ===

State and national parks developed around mills and rivers were restored. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974) and &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Story&quot; (1978) were filmed locally including at Stanley Woolen Mill. The Blackstone Valley National Historic Park contains the Blackstone Canal Heritage State Park, of the Blackstone River Greenway, the Southern New England Trunkline Trail (which has the interesting SNETT stone chamber south of Lee pond), West Hill Dam, a 567-acre wildlife refuge, parcels of the Metacomet Land Trust, and Cormier Woods. 60 Federalist homes were added to 54 national and 375 state-listed historic sites, including Georgian Elmshade (where War Secretary Alphonso Taft had recounted local family history at a famous reunion). Capron&#x27;s wooden mill survived a 2007 fire at the Bernat Mill. Stanley mill is being restored while Waucantuck Mill was mostly razed.

<text>West Boylston is a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States and a northern suburb of Worcester. The population was 7,877 at the 2020 census. West Boylston includes the village of Oakdale, located on the opposite side of the Wachusett Reservoir from West Boylston center along Route 140. Although the town was split off from Boylston, it has a larger population than its eastern namesake.

==History==

West Boylston was originally part of several neighboring towns—Lancaster, Shrewsbury, Boylston, Holden and Sterling. The town was created as part of a dispute between Boylston and West Boylston over the location of a new town meeting house. The town was officially incorporated in 1808.

During the 1800s the town grew with textile and other industries and became a prosperous community. This prosperity was interrupted as the town was selected as the site of the Wachusett Reservoir to provide water for Boston. It was selected due to its location at the junction of three rivers: the Quinapoxet River, the Stillwater River and the Nashua River. In 1897, the Nashua River in the town of Clinton was impounded by the Wachusett Dam, causing to be flooded in the towns of Boylston, West Boylston, Clinton and Sterling. Over of West Boylston&#x27;s land was used for the reservoir, the most of any town. This disrupted the center of town and most of the industrial base. Many buildings were moved to the unaffected parts of the town but the majority were demolished and filled by the reservoir. Over 1700 residents, 300 homes, eight schools, six mills, four churches and one hotel were moved to dry land. The state paid approximately 60 cents on the dollar for use of the land with the promise to pay $12,000 a year to the town for lost tax revenue forever. The reservoir was completed in 1905 and first filled in May 1908. West Boylston&#x27;s prominent landmark, the Old Stone Church, was left remaining as a reminder of those that lost their homes and jobs to the building of the reservoir. It is one of the most photographed sites in the area.

Today, West Boylston has transformed itself into a bedroom community for Worcester and the surrounding region. Due to the reservoir, the town has been able to preserve much of its rural character, making it an attractive place for recreation and living.

West Boylston&#x27;s most famous historical resident is Robert Bailey Thomas, the founder of the &quot;Old Farmer&#x27;s Almanac&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 6.86%, is water. The main water source is the Wachusett Reservoir, which is located in the middle of the town. The town does not get use of this water, it is for Boston. West Boylston gets its water from two town wells.

As of the 2010 Census, there were 7,669 people, 2,616 households, and 1,817 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 2,746 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 93.34% White, 4.21% African American, 0.22% Native American, 0.68% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.86% from other races, and 0.67% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.27% of the population.

There were 2,616 households, out of which 27.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.7% were married couples living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.5% were non-families. Of all households 25.9% were made up of individuals, and 11.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.43 and the average family size was 2.98.

The median age was 46 years. For every 100 females there were 124.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 130.2 males.
[The population of West Boylston (7,669 in 2010) includes the 1,137 male residents of the Worcester County House of Correction; 14.8% of the town&#x27;s recorded population. So it would seem that West Boylston has about 25% more males than females (124 males for every 100 females) but that statistic is misleading.]

<text>Whitinsville is an unincorporated village within the town of Northbridge in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. Whitinsville is a census-designated place (CDP) and its population was 6,750 at the 2020 census. Whitinsville is pronounced as if it were spelled &quot;White-ins-ville&quot;. It was founded by the Whitin family, after whom it is also named. It is a post office jurisdiction, with a ZIP Code of 01588. It is located on the Mumford River, a tributary of the Blackstone River.
Whitinsville has been designated as a mill village of national historic significance to America&#x27;s earliest industrialization, and is one of only four villages selected by the John H. Chaffee Blackstone River Valley National Historic Corridor Commission to receive this designation. Hopedale is the only other Massachusetts mill village to achieve this designation by the corridor commission.

==History==

This village was originally Nipmuc native lands, and was first settled as part of Mendon in 1662. From 1662 to 1727 it was part of Mendon, then later it became part of Uxbridge from 1727 to 1772. In 1772 Northbridge finally became a separate town. The village&#x27;s early name was &quot;South Northbridge&quot;, before the Whitin family&#x27;s rise to prominence. Col. John Spring led a militia training company from Uxbridge which fought in the American Revolution. Col. Spring was from the section that became South Northbridge.

Today a visitor can see much of the original village, including the housing for workers and their families, churches, and the Whitin Community Center. The textile machine company and industrial village were written up as one of the Harvard studies of history in business. Whitin Machine, founded in 1831, became the largest manufacturer of textile machinery in the world before its closing in 1964.

A 1936 Berlin Olympics champion backstroke swimmer, Alice Bridges, then of Uxbridge, trained in the local gym pool (Whitin Community Center) in Whitinsville. The Whitinsville Savings Bank was involved in a precedent-setting case in the U.S., involving tort and contract law, known as &quot;Swinton vs. Whitinsville Savings Bank (1942)&quot;. A real estate transaction two years earlier had failed to disclose termites in a building.
==Whitin Community Center==

The Whitin Community Center, operated by a non-profit organization and commonly called &quot;The Gym&quot;, is located at 60 Main Street on what used to be the John C. Whitin estate. In 1922, four Whitin daughters: Elsa, Katharine, Lois, and Elizabeth, gave the funds to build a gym and pool for the enjoyment of local citizens in memory of their father, George Marston Whitin. This recreation center, known affectionately in earlier days as &quot;The Gym,&quot; was one of the finest facilities in the state. Famous for its swim program, it sent swimmers to the 1932 and 1936 Olympics. Devastated by fire in 1959, the Gym was rebuilt with the support of trustees, business and civic leaders, and friends.

The decade of the 1990s was dedicated to expanding and modernizing the Whitin Community Center to prepare it for the 21st century. In 1993 new space was added to strengthen the center&#x27;s commitment to child care and adult health and fitness. A new lobby, elevator, and racquetball courts completed this expansion phase, and most of the original 1922 building received a comprehensive face lift. In 1995, the center&#x27;s three outdoor tennis courts were completely refurbished. Ground was broken in September 1996 for a new state-of-the-art competition-sized swimming pool. This new facility opened briefly as an outdoor pool (summer 1998) and then was enclosed for year-round use, reopening in March 1999. A comprehensive project to restore the historic appearance of the Main Street facade was undertaken in 1998–99, funded by individuals, local companies, and the Massachusetts Historical Commission. Also in 1999, the center&#x27;s parking facilities were expanded to accommodate the increased business. An ambitious plan to restore and beautify historic Whitin Park (the 7.5 acres behind the Whitin Community Center) was unveiled in early 2000. The nearly 1 mile of stone perimeter walls were rebuilt, repointed and recapped. New walking trails were surfaced, and beautiful park lights and bollards have been installed. In the location of an original Whitin estate building – the rustic teahouse – the Gerry Gaudette pavilion has been built. This open air shelter is used by the center&#x27;s child care and summer camp program, along with use by the community at large.

The Whitin Community Center today is a vibrant organization with 4,500 members. The center also, through its mission, services at least as many non-members. It is a recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit organization providing child care and family recreational services. With over 200 families currently served, it is the largest Child Care Center in the Blackstone Valley with a pre-kindergarten school, full day care for pre-schoolers, and a large school-age program that provides supervision before and after school, and all day long on school vacation periods.

The center launched a new Outreach program in 1995, funded entirely by donations, with the goal of bringing together all the children of the community, regardless of neighborhoods, economic status, or whether or not they were Center members. Organized Saturday afternoon activities, open swimming, day trips to museums and baseball games, youth theater, teen dances, and concerts are just some of the many activities. In January 2002 a new facility opened – the Rockdale Youth Center – providing free after school programs and supervision for youngsters ages 8–13. In the fall of 2005, the Center purchased the building housing the program (2219 Providence Road, Northbridge).

==St. Camillus Health Center==
The St. Camillus Health Center, originally St. Camillus Hospital for Incurable Diseases, is located at 447 Hill Street on the historic E. Kent Swift Estate named for the husband of one of George Marston Whitin&#x27;s daughters. The historic mansion on the rear of the estate was restored in 1999 and is now known as Father Turci Manor.

==Pine Grove Cemetery==
Endowed in 1878 by members of the Whitin family, the 35-acre historic cemetery is located on 241 Linwood Ave. The cemetery was put up for sale by the Pine Grove Cemetery Association in 2011, and is currently owned by the Town of Northbridge.

==Government==

Whitinsville is a village within the town of Northbridge. New England towns, like Northbridge, administer the entire geography within their boundaries and function like a city and a county government rolled into one. The county government is weak or non-existent in the southern New England states. Worcester County exists today only as a historical area, with an elected County Sheriff, an elected county registrar of deeds, and a correctional and court system, which are now administered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and its Office of Public Safety. County commissioners were last elected in 1999, and local roads are now administered either by the towns or the state.

The Northbridge Town Hall is located at 7 Main Street in Whitinsville, the largest village in the town. It was built in 1876, and from 1876 to 1913 it served as the public library. The Town Hall was extensively renovated in 2013.

Northbridge is organized and administered as a town under Massachusetts law. The Board of Selectmen exercises executive functions, while the annual Town Meeting functions like a city council. Police, public works, the board of health, fire department and schools are part of the town government.

<text>Harrisville is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan and the county seat of Alcona County. The population was 437 at the 2020 census, making Harrisville the sixth-smallest city by population in the state of Michigan. The city is surrounded by Harrisville Township but is administratively autonomous. Located on Lake Huron, it is an official Michigan Department of Natural Resources Harbor of Refuge.

==History==
The place was first known as Davison&#x27;s Mill after Crosier Davison, who in partnership with Simeon Holden, had purchased land and water power rights here in 1854. Benjamin Harris and his sons, Levi and Henry, of West Bloomfield, New York bought out the partners. A post office established on September 16, 1857, was named Harrisville, with Levi as the first postmaster.

The Harrises sold out to Weston, (George L.) Colwell &amp; Company, who had H.G. Rothwell plat the community in 1870. Harrisville was incorporated as a village in 1887 and as a city in 1905.

In 1908, the town narrowly survived in the shadow of the Metz Fire, the largest modern forest fire in Michigan. It was the beneficiary of an on shore wind.

Pizer&#x27;s Variety Store, originally The White Store, was at the corner of Lake Street and Main Street.

Ki Cuyler&#x27;s Bar was a long time popular landmark which burnt in 2018. The building was torn down.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. It is considered to be part of Northern Michigan.

The city is on the western shore of Lake Huron and has a harbor for recreational boaters. The harbor is a center for salmon and trout fishing. It is also a designated &quot;Harbor of Refuge&quot; on Lake Huron by the United States Coast Guard. The town also boasts Harrisville State Park, which includes a wooded campground along the beach. Sturgeon Point Light, a lighthouse and museum, is a few miles to the north, and is open to the public.

Harrisville is on the edge of Huron National Forest, which offers outdoor recreational opportunities such as hunting, swimming, cross-country skiing and trout fishing. The forest contains of hiking trails. The Huron and Manistee National Forests were separately designated but were combined in 1945 for administrative purposes.

The Lake Huron beaches in and around Harrisville (including two state parks) have been recognized as being among the &quot;top ten in Michigan.&quot; &quot;Old-fashioned lake vacations abound on this pretty stretch of Lake Huron.&quot;

Harrisville is situated along the Lake State Railway, formerly the Detroit and Mackinac Railway (D&amp;M). The 1901 D&amp;M passenger depot is made of stone, which makes it one of two along the railway (the other being in Standish). As of 2023, it is privately maintained by local citizens as part of the municipality&#x27;s historical legacy.

<text>Allegan ( ) is a city and the county seat of Allegan County, Michigan Its population was 5,222 at the 2020 census. It is located southwest of Grand Rapids and northwest of Kalamazoo, both via US 131. It lies within Allegan Township but is administratively autonomous.

==History==
The men after whom Allegan&#x27;s downtown streets were named – Elisha Ely, Samuel Hubbard, Charles Christopher Trowbridge, Pliny Cutler, and Edmund Monroe – patented land in the area in 1833. They considered the site a prime location for industry, due to its potential for water power (since it straddled the Kalamazoo River) and water bound transportation. By 1835, a dam and sawmill had been established.

Allegan was named in a neologism by Michigan historian Henry Rowe Schoolcraft in 1837 to sound like a Native American word. Land was purchased from government to form the downtown business district; village organization came in 1838 with city incorporation authorized in 1907.

In 1886, a one-lane bridge was built over the Kalamazoo River to connect limited highway M-89 to the downtown area. The bridge fell into disrepair and was going to be removed until a group of activists raised the money to restore the bridge in 1983. Now a highlight of Allegan, the one-lane bridge is used in the city logo and is considered an important part of the city.

In 1914, Allegan entered the automobile race car industry as the manufacturing site of Howard E. Blood and Louis Chevrolet&#x27;s chain-drive Cornelian automobile. The venture was short-lived, and less than 100 Cornelians were produced.

==History==
Douglas, originally known as Dudleyville, was first settled by European-Americans in 1851 as a lumber mill town. In 1861, residents changed the name to Douglas. Reportedly the name was chosen to honor the American statesman Stephen A. Douglas, but other reports indicate that a relative of the original owner of the land also suggested the name because he came from Douglas, the capital of the Isle of Man. Douglas was incorporated as a village in 1870.

Area sawmills provided much of the lumber used to rebuild Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. After most of the harvestable trees in the area were cleared by the lumber industry, the area became a center for growing and shipping fruit, especially peaches. Tourism and resorts also became an important part of the area economy.

<text>Fennville is a city in Allegan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,745 at the 2020 census.

Located on M-89 on the boundary between Manlius Township to the north and Clyde Township to the south, Fennville is located about southeast of the city of Saugatuck and about west-northwest of the city of Allegan. It is about south of Holland, about northeast of South Haven and roughly miles southwest of Grand Rapids.

== History ==

The &quot;official&quot; and widely accepted account of how the city came to be known as Fennville, is that an early white settler by the name of Elam Atwater Fenn built a saw mill in the immediate vicinity of the current community. This led to people referring to the settlement as &quot;Fenn&#x27;s Mill&quot; which became the name associated with the post office there. Some early documents pluralized &quot;Mill&quot; to render &quot;Fenn&#x27;s Mills.&quot; The first road through what was to be Fennville was built by Harrison Hutchins and James McCormick in 1837.

A fire (possibly related to the Great Chicago Fire or Great Michigan Fire) destroyed the village in October 1871. About that time, the paperwork (timetables and such) for the recently completed Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad arrived which identified the community&#x27;s station as &quot;Fennville.&quot; This was thought by some at the time (including Hutchins) to have been the result of clerical error. However, Fenn himself recorded that the change in name had been suggested by and mutually agreed upon among certain leaders of the community in conjunction with the establishment of the new railroad station. The post office name was then changed to &quot;Fennville&quot; to match the station&#x27;s name. The community was officially incorporated as the village of Fennville on February 20, 1889.

A United States atlas from 1895 indicates the town name was in some cases broken into two words, as in &quot;Fenn Ville.&quot; Yet another documented variation was &quot;Fennsville,&quot; as found in a plat book from 1873.

<text>Manlius Township is a civil township of Allegan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,312 at the 2020 census.

==History==
A post to trade with the local Ottawa people was established by a man named Campau here in 1825. The township was established in 1839.

==Communities==
The city of Fennville is at the southwest corner of the township, but is administratively autonomous.

=== New Richmond ===
New Richmond is an unincorporated community within the township at near where Old Allegan Road and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway cross the Kalamazoo River. It is about a mile west of where the Rabbit River flows into the Kalamazoo. In 1836, three eastern investors, led by John Allen of Ann Arbor, arranged to found a city here. Allen platted the village of &quot;Richmond&quot;, after his home town of Richmond, Virginia. The village was platted covering all of section 8 and the eastern half of section 7, just a bit north and west of the present location. Some land was cleared, a general store and some houses were built, and in November 1837, a post office opened named &quot;Richmond&quot;. However, the office closed in October 1839, after Allen&#x27;s business venture failed in 1838 due to financial depression following the Panic of 1837.

Ralph R. Mann, who had been hired by Allen to direct improvements at Richmond, in 1844 moved to a location to the south of the first site and built a water-powered sawmill on the river. This settlement became known as &quot;Manlius&quot;, and a post office opened in July 1846. It is said to be named after Manlius, New York. It was for a while a station on the Chicago and West Michigan Railway, but was mostly abandoned in 1874 after the destruction of the mill&#x27;s dam and the local tavern burned down. With the coming of the railroad, H. F. Marsh laid out a new village of Richmond near the older site, which prospered and after a time supplanted Manlius. In October 1872, the post office was closed in Manlius and another was established named &quot;New Richmond&quot;. After a time, the settlement also came to be known as &quot;New Richmond&quot;.

<text>Otsego is a city in Allegan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,120 at the 2020 census. The city is within Otsego Township, but is administratively autonomous.

Otsego is situated on M-89 about three miles (5 km) west of Plainwell and US 131. It is about nine miles (14 km) southeast of Allegan and the Kalamazoo River flows east to west through the city.

==History==

Otsego was established in fall of 1831 by the Samuel Foster family from Vermont, called Pine Creek by its initial settlers: Giles Scott and Hull Sherwood. A post office was established in 1832 under the name of Allegan, the name being changed to Otsego in 1835 with the organization of Allegan County, spearheaded by Otsego resident Dr. Samuel Foster. 1833 brought a school to the new town, and a hotel - the Tompkins House - followed in the 1860s.

On June 6, 1863, at Aaron Hilliard&#x27;s house Ellen G. White, a founder of the Seventh-day Adventist church, experienced a vision about health and disease, and it showed vegetarian food, as was described in Genesis 1:29, was the proper food for humankind. Her vision led to the creation of many vegetarian foods and vegetarian food companies, including the Battle Creek Sanitarium and Loma Linda Foods.

In the 1870s, visitors from all over the Midwest journeyed to Otsego to experience the &quot;medicinal&quot; waters at the Otsego Mineral Springs Bath House, which remained a regional draw until 1887 when George Bardeen&#x27;s paper mill operation depleted the town&#x27;s mineral springs.

The 1880s saw some big advances for Otsego. In 1883, Otsego High School held its first commencement ceremony, graduating three students; a home-delivery milk route was started up in 1885; and 1886 brought the establishment of the volunteer fire department, which initially used horse-drawn water-wagons. The decade closed out with the formation of the city&#x27;s Republican Club in 1888.

In 1881, Wilson C. Edsell built the town&#x27;s first bank and opera house. Edsell&#x27;s Opera House was the primary entertainment venue in town for many years until the opening of the Nickelodeon (Irv Nichols&#x27;s theatre venture) in 1909. An &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; troupe played the Opera House stage on an annual basis. Native American vaudeville shows, called &quot;medicine shows&quot;, were popular. Maro the Magician, stock theater groups, minstrel shows took the opera house stage on a regular basis, with the minstrel shows led by the town&#x27;s one African American resident Jim Smith.

The city&#x27;s baseball park was sold to the area Catholics as a site for a church in 1890. The Russell Buggy Company came to town as well, making popular ironclad carriages. The Bardeen Mansion was completed in 1894, which was razed in 1962–63. A smallpox epidemic swept the town in 1894, as well.

During the 1902 baseball season, Otsego was home to Negro league baseball great Andrew &quot;Rube&quot; Foster, who played for George E. Bardeen&#x27;s Michigan State League white semi-professional team, the Otsego Independents, before signing on as a pitcher with the Cuban X-Giants, considered by many to be the greatest team in Negro leagues history. He would later be instrumental in the founding of the Negro National League. For a time, Otsego had a &quot;Rube Street,&quot; but it was renamed &quot;Washington Street.&quot; On 17 April 2000, John Chapman, a local elementary teacher, petitioned the City Council to have one of the six baseball diamonds at Memorial Park renamed in Foster&#x27;s honor. The city approved placement of a monument to him at the park by a 3–1 vote.

A flu epidemic struck 800 residents, killing some, in 1918.

Otsego was struck by a tornado in 1962, uprooting trees and wiping out electricity/telephone services for several days.

== History ==
The Pine Creek settlement known also as New Rochester was a community located at 42° 27&#x27; 24.30&quot; N, 85° 43&#x27; 59.64&quot; W near the junction of Pine Creek and the Kalamazoo river in Otsego Township, Allegan County, Michigan.  It was approximately two miles west of the present day city of Otsego. The site was first explored in 1829 by Giles Scott and the Sherwoods of Rochester, New York, Samuel Foster from Vermont, and Turner Aldrich, Jr. of Cattaraugus County, New York, while searching for pine tracts and a location to construct a mill site. Giles Scott, the son-in-law of Hull Sherwood returned to the mouth of the Pine Creek with his wife and small children in 1830 and constructed a small log cabin in 1831. Shortly following Scott, Turner Aldrich, Jr., arrived in Pine Creek. Aldrich built a water powered saw mill located on Pine Creek, one mile from its mouth in 1831. The mill constructed by Aldrich is believed to have cut the first lumber in Western Michigan. The mill burned down shortly after construction but was rebuilt by Aldrich in 1832.  Hull Sherwood settled in Pine Creek in 1831.  With the aid of Scott a dam and saw-mill were constructed at the mouth of the creek. The saw mill was completed in the winter of 1831-32.  Soon followed by the construction of a grist mill in 1834. Lands were held by settlers through pre-emption until they were placed on the market by the government, at which time settlers were required to report to the nearest land office to pay for their land.

Hull Sherwood platted the village named New Rochester at Pine Creek, which remained a prominent settlement through the 1830s. In 1833 the first school was taught by Dr. Lintsford B. Coates just to the east of Pine Creek.  A bridge crossing the Kalamazoo River was constructed at Pine Creek in 1835.  In the same year the Higgins saw mill began operation at Pine Creek.  In 1836, Giles Scott, who was known as an excellent fiddler constructed the tavern known as Pine Creek House over which he presided until his death in 1840.  The decline of New Rochester began following severe economic conditions resulting from the panic of 1837, but some economic activity continued in the Pine Creek area. In 1850 another saw mill was constructed two miles south of the Pine Creek settlement, known as Leighton’s Saw Mill.  A cider mill opened at Pine Creek in 1869.  In 1880, an iron bridge with two spans and one pier was built over the Pine Creek.  The following year the Pine Creek Grange Hall was completed. The building is still in use, after being moved to its present location east of the Pine River in 1903.  Herman Jungnitsch open a blacksmith shop at Pine Creek in 1885.  Wash Morter also operated a blacksmith shop at Pine Creek, the original building was relocated to its present location east of the Pine Creek on top of a hill. A post office was established in 1899 under the name Dent because a Pine Creek office already existed and was operated by Miss Mae Carroll.  In 1903, the construction of the Pine Creek Dam of the Commonwealth, later known as Consumers Power Company, was completed and after the buildings of the small settlement near the Pine Creek known as New Rochester were either moved or torn down, the area was flooded.

<doc id="117018" wikidata="Q2273620" url="?curid=117018" title="Plainwell, Michigan">
<text>Plainwell is a city in Allegan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,788 at the 2020 census.

Plainwell is located on M-89 just east of its junction with US 131. The city of Otsego is about to the west. The city of Kalamazoo is about to the south, and the city of Grand Rapids is about to the north. The Kalamazoo River flows through the center of the city and it is known as &quot;The Island City&quot;.

==History==
This part of Michigan was settled in the 1830s, after the removal of native people. Allegan County was organized in 1835, and the Plainwell area was settled soon after. It was on a stagecoach route from Kalamazoo to Grand Rapids, and later the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad was constructed along the same route. After the advent of the automobile, U.S. Route 131 was created and run through the town. In the 1960s, an improved 4-lane US-131 was built west of town to connect Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids, with an interchange on M-89 between Plainwell and Otsego. This allowed the town to become a kind of &quot;bedroom community&quot; for Kalamazoo or the southern part of Grand Rapids.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The nickname &quot;Island City&quot; has to do with a power canal which diverts a portion of the Kalamazoo River around the downtown area, causing it to be an island.
===Major highways===
* is a freeway that is located in the western portion of the city.
* follows M-89 for most of its route in Plainwell, but soon has a concurrency with U.S. 131 just before the city line.
* has a concurrency with M-43 for most of its route in Plainwell, but continues west alone into Otsego.

<doc id="117020" wikidata="Q2686437" url="?curid=117020" title="Saugatuck, Michigan">
<text>Saugatuck ( ) is a city in Allegan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 865 at the 2020 census. The city is within Saugatuck Township, but is administratively autonomous.

Originally a lumber town and port, Saugatuck, along with the adjacent city of Douglas, became a noted art colony and tourist destination in the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, Saugatuck was home to the famous Big Pavilion, a large dance hall that attracted bands and visitors from across the Midwest. The building was a popular destination on Lake Michigan from its construction in 1909 until it burned down on May 6, 1960.

Today, tourists are drawn to the art galleries, harbor, marinas, scenery, unusual stores, the view from atop Mount Baldhead, and tourist attractions as well as Oval Beach on Lake Michigan, which enjoys a worldwide reputation. Nearby are Saugatuck Dunes State Park and Allegan State Game Area as is the city of Holland. Saugatuck is known as a popular vacation destination for the LGBT+ community with similar cultural attributes as Fire Island Pines and Provincetown, Massachusetts. 

==History==
William C. Butler was the first European-American settler in 1830 of &quot;Kalamazoo village&quot;, as it was at first known. He bought land and had a village plat laid out in 1833. In 1836 the legislature gave Kalamazoo, formerly known as Bronson in honor of Titus Bronson, its current name. Thus the community was renamed after the township current name, Newark. The first postmaster suggested the name of Saugatuck, a native American name signifying a stream outlet, for the post office, and this name was taken when Saugatuck was incorporated as a village in 1868 by the County Board of Supervisors. The village was reincorporated by the legislature in its 1869-1870 session.

Its charter was amended in 1893. In 1895, the village came under the village general law for its government. The Saugatuck and Ganges Phone Company was formed for the village in 1893–1894.

In 1968, a hundred years after incorporation as a village, Saugatuck might have looked into incorporating as a city, but it appears incorporation actually happened in 1984, according to historical information on the Saugatuck city website.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Tourism==
Saugatuck&#x27;s primary source of revenue stems from tourism: although only about 1,000 individuals call Saugatuck their year-round home, the population of the town swells to nearly 3,000 in the summer. Saugatuck is a prime summer weekend getaway destination for residents of Chicago, Grand Rapids, and Detroit areas, some attracted by the many bed and breakfasts in the area. In 2010, Saugatuck came in fourth in &quot;Budget Travel&quot; magazine&#x27;s ten coolest towns in America.

In town, attractions include the many art galleries (over a dozen), small, independent shops, and several restaurants. The Star of Saugatuck, a large paddle-wheel boat, gives daily tours of the Kalamazoo River and Lake Michigan. The Saugatuck Chain Ferry, a hand-cranked vessel, departs from Wick&#x27;s Park and takes tourists from the town side of the river to the other shore for a walk to the beach, the historical museum or to climb the stairs at Mt. Baldhead. In addition to the art and music festivals throughout the year, the Saugatuck Center for the Arts features equity theater, music concerts, art exhibits, educational events, a green market, and is available for event rental.

Other attractions include the nearby town of Douglas, Saugatuck&#x27;s sister city. Saugatuck&#x27;s historic churches contribute to a vibrant community while preserving some of the oldest buildings in town. The oldest of these churches is First Congregational Church, founded in 1860. Douglas was home to the &quot;SS Keewatin&quot;, a coal-fired steamship formerly of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The 105-year-old ship was a floating museum and a fixture in the harbor until it was recently purchased and moved back to Canada.

Since the 1970s, Saugatuck and neighboring Douglas have been popular as a tourist destination for gay and lesbian tourists from the Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Grand Rapids areas, as well as other Midwestern urban areas. It has even been nicknamed by some as the Fire Island or Provincetown of the Midwest.

From 2004 to 2006, Oklahoma billionaire Aubrey McClendon bought of undeveloped duneland in Saugatuck Township for $39.5 million with plans to build luxury homes, 28 condos, a hotel, a marina, and a golf course. In 2006, the Saugatuck Township Board re-zoned the land, making McClendon unable to build his planned project. The Saugatuck Dunes Coastal Alliance opposes McClendon&#x27;s plans, citing environmental concerns. In 2009, McClendon sold of the land in order to alleviate the group&#x27;s concerns.

<text>Wayland is a city in Allegan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,435 at the 2020 census.

The city is located at the northwest corner of Wayland Township, but is politically independent. The city has also incorporated a portion of land in the south of adjacent Leighton Township. U.S. Route 131 forms the western boundary of the city. The city is home to OpenRoad Brewery, as well as several local restaurants and businesses.

==History==

About two hundred years ago, the area now known as Wayland, Michigan was inhabited by the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of the Pottawatomi, a Native American tribe in Michigan. The tribe lived in settled villages, hunted game, and farmed and harvested corn and wild rice, in addition to making maple sugar tree sap. The tribe is federally recognized and is headquartered in nearby Wayland Township. It owns the Gun Lake Casino, opened in 2011.
The area began changing under pressure of European-American development. By 1826 the land had been surveyed for settlement in United States style. Colonel Isaac Barnes, attracted by the extensive forests of pine and hardwoods, purchased a tract of land along the Rabbit River and began operating a mill producing lumber and wooden shingles, giving the area its first name, Lumberton.

In 1837, the Barnes family arrived and began clearing the land for farming, and by the 1840s, several more families had settled in the area. This growth brought enough children to the area to justify building the first American-style school in 1844. 
In 1855 a road was built to connect the two larger towns of Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo, running directly through Chamber&#x27;s Corners, the main intersection in the city. This area is now known by that name. This busy road led to increased commerce, and business in the form of dairy farms and factories, which led to further growth over time.

The area was officially named Wayland in 1868 after a town in New York, as many migrants had come from that state.

<text>Alpena ( &quot;&quot;) is the only city and the county seat of Alpena County, Michigan, United States. The population was 10,197 at the 2020 census, making it the third most populated city in the Northern Michigan region, after Traverse City and Cadillac. The city is surrounded by Alpena Township, but the two are administered autonomously. It is the core city of the Alpena micropolitan statistical area, which encompasses all of Alpena County and had a total population of 28,907 at the 2020 census.

Alpena is located at the head of Thunder Bay, a bay of Lake Huron. Offshore of Alpena is the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which protects an estimated 116 historically significant shipwrecks. Alpena is the third-largest American city on Lake Huron, behind Bay City and Port Huron.

==History==

The Alpena area is home to the Ojibwe, Ottawa, and Potawatomi people. These people groups inhabit the area surrounding the Great Lakes, including Michigan. The Thunder Bay Band of Chippewa and Ottawa merged with the Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians in the mid-1800s under Chief Way-ge-maw-waw-be.

Alpena County was originally set off from Michilimackinac County as Anamickee County founded in 1840, which in 1843 was changed to Alpena, a pseudo-Native American word — a neologism coined by Henry Schoolcraft, meaning something like &quot;a good partridge country.&quot; This was part of a much larger effort to rename a great many of the Michigan counties at the time.

The first European settler at modern-day Alpena was W.F. Cullings, a fisherman in 1835. In 1856, George W. Fletcher and three others from Detroit platted a village by the name of Fremont, after John C. Frémont. The community was briefly renamed Thunder Bay in 1857 before being renamed again to Alpena in 1871. The city of Alpena was officially incorporated by Michigan State Legislature on March 29, 1871.

Most of the city was lost in the Great Michigan Fire of 1871. Less than one year later, on July 12, 1872, Alpena was hit by another fire, the largest in its history, which destroyed of homes and businesses for a total amount of 65 buildings. The blaze started in a barn and lasted for two hours, killing at least four people and causing at least in damages. Alpena was again hit by a disastrous fire on July 11, 1888. In the early 1910s a failed attempt was led by the Alpena Motor Car Company to turn the city into &quot;Automobile City&quot; and compete with Detroit.

In 1920 the population of the city was 11,101, and in 1927 the trade through the city&#x27;s port was valued over 8 million dollars, and the output of the 24 factories at a little under another 8 million.

The city has a number of notable buildings, including the Art deco Alpena County Courthouse, the I.O.O.F. Centennial Building, and Temple Beth El, one of the oldest synagogues in the United States.

===Historical markers===
There are seven recognized historical markers in the city:

* Alpena City Hall
* Alpena County Courthouse
* The Daniel Carter Family, Alpena&#x27;s first settlers.
* First Congregational Church
* Monarch Mill
* St. Bernard Catholic Church
* World&#x27;s Largest Cement Plant (see Lafarge)

==Culture==

Alpena is served by a number of institutions that enhance the artistic and cultural character of the city, reflecting its rich heritage in Great Lakes shipping and industry. Alpena is the gateway to the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, one of Michigan&#x27;s 13 underwater preserves. The cold, fresh waters of the Great Lakes serve a valuable role in preserving the numerous shipwrecks in Lake Huron, documenting a history of tragedy that spans over 300 years. The Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center in Alpena is the interpretive and administrative center of the sanctuary, located on the banks of the Thunder Bay River.

The local history of the Alpena area is documented by the Besser Museum, founded with an endowment from industrialist Jesse Besser. The Besser Museum is located on an campus in northern Alpena, and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Permanent attractions at the Besser Museum include a planetarium and the Katherine V., a wooden fishing tug that spent its entire life on Lake Huron. The Besser Museum also features rotating collections of art, science, and local history. The museum is the publisher of &quot;The Town that Wouldn&#x27;t Die: A Photographic History of Alpena, Michigan from Its Beginnings Through 1940&quot;.

The Alpena County George N. Fletcher Public Library serves Alpena County. Its special collections include the Northeast Michigan Oral History Archive, the comprehensive Great Lakes Maritime Collection, and a full collection of Alpena newspapers dating back to 1871.

Arts organizations in the Alpena area include the Alpena Symphony Orchestra; the Alpena Civic Theatre; and the Thunder Bay Theatre, Northeast Michigan&#x27;s year-round professional theatre located in the historic 1904 Spens Block on North Second Ave. Cinema in Alpena is supported by the newly opened Sanctuary Cinema, located in a former JCPenney store in Downtown Alpena, and the Maltz Opera House, under renovation to its 1920s-era appearance.

<text>Bellaire ( ) is a village and the county seat of Antrim County, Michigan, United States. The population was 1,053 in 2020 census.

The village is split between Forest Home and Kearney townships. The historic Antrim County Courthouse is located in Bellaire. The &quot;Antrim Review&quot;, the county&#x27;s newspaper of record, is headquartered in Bellaire.

==History==

The Bellaire post office opened under the name Keno on June 20, 1879, and changed to Bellaire on May 26, 1880. Also, in 1880, Bellaire became the county seat of Antrim County, a position that Elk Rapids had previously had. The Chicago &amp; West Michigan Railroad built a depot in Bellaire in 1891, and the East Jordan &amp; Southern Railroad built another line into the town in 1901.

The furnace flourished, and in 1886 a group of businessmen from Grand Rapids bought out the company, and renamed the company Antrim Iron Works and the town Antrim.

*Forest Lake is a small community around the reservoir named Forest Lake on the east-central part of the township. The lake is formed by a dam on Wells Creek. Water from Forest Lake is released into the Rifle River.

==History==
Moffatt Township was organized in 1874, at the time part of Bay County. The community of Alger was named after Russell A. Alger almost a decade later. In 1882 to 1883, the area of Alger was created from the formation of a railroad junction along the Michigan Central Railroad. This junction came from the now defunct Bay City and Alpena Railroad out of Prescott, Michigan. It was constructed under the direction of Russell Alger, who later became the 20th governor of Michigan, and then the U.S. Secretary of War. The railroads were thriving mainly due to Michigan&#x27;s lumbering boom at the time, and Alger grew to be a popular settlement with many mills, restaurants, and saloons. Two small towns named Culver and Wells existed nearby. Culver was located about a mile north, and Wells was about a mile south of downtown Alger.

In 1896 the railroad from Prescott ceased operations, and into the early 1900s (decade), as the timber reached depletion, the logging railroads disappeared along with businesses. Today, Wells and Culver no longer exist, and Alger has slowly downsized to a small community of approximately 1,000 people.

<text>Omer is a city in Arenac County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 274 at the 2020 census, which ranks it as the least-populated city in the state.

Omer is consistently ranked as &quot;Michigan&#x27;s Smallest City&quot; in terms of population, although the city of Lake Angelus held this distinction when it recorded a lower population at the 2010 census. Lake Angelus recorded a higher population of 287 at the 2020 census, making Omer again the state&#x27;s least-populated city. 

==History==

Omer was founded by George Gorie and George Carscallen, who set up a sawmill along the Rifle River in 1866. The town was originally named Rifle River Mills, but Carscallen, the first postmaster, wanted to rename the town Homer. However, he found a post office in another town called Homer, Michigan and simply dropped the leading H, producing the final name. The community received a station on the Detroit and Mackinaw Railroad, while in 1872 the area was platted. In 1883, Omer was split off from Bay County into the newly formed Arenac County.

Omer was incorporated as a city in 1903. A fire in 1914 almost eliminated the city, destroying 40 buildings and ending the early thrive that Omer had. Two years later, a flood curtailed rebuilding efforts by washing out the local dam.

Omer is the location of the story of the &quot;cussing canoeist&quot;, the man who received a ticket under a century-old law for shouting a long stream of expletives in the presence of a woman and her two young children after he fell out of a canoe on the Rifle River. The American Civil Liberties Union intervened on the canoeist&#x27;s behalf and got the law struck down in court.

A second news story of note concerned the successful secession of two households from the city because the City of Omer was charging them a water tax while refusing to deliver water service to their property.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of of which is land and (2.59%) is water.

The Rifle River runs through the city, which is a prominent fishing location for sucker fish in the spring. An annual festival and fishing tournament are held in Omer.

<text>Arvon Township ( ) is a civil township of Baraga County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 492. Despite its name, Mount Arvon, the highest point in Michigan, is located just south of the township, in neighboring L&#x27;Anse Township.

Arvon Township&#x27;s name is derived from that of the district of Carnarvon in Wales, famous for its slate industry, because of the deposits of slate in the township which were once the site of a failed quarry operation.

==Communities==
* Arvon, named after the township in 1872, began as a slate quarry village. A post office operated from June 8, 1874, until November 18, 1879, and again from May 18, 1882, until October 14, 1893.
*Aura is located at the base of the Point Abbaye peninsula on the northern side of Huron Bay.
*Huron Bay is a community located on Huron Bay a few miles southwest of Skanee. Here there is a convenience store and a tavern. Huron Bay was formerly the terminus of the Iron Range and Huron Bay Railroad, built to carry iron ore from Champion to Huron Bay. A post office was in operation from July 29, 1892, until January 31, 1894.
*McComb Corner is an unincorporated community in the township.
*Skanee is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) within the township.
*St. Cyr is an unincorporated community in the township, lying on Huron Bay.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.62%, is water.

Arvon Township includes the Abbaye Peninsula, which projects into Lake Superior to form Huron Bay. The bay is long and narrow so its waters are significantly more protected than those of the open lake. Much of the shoreline, particularly around the tip of the peninsula at Point Abbaye, is rocky, although there are some stretches of sandy beach.

Much of the land in Arvon Township is forest with mixed deciduous and coniferous trees. There are also jack pine barrens and eastern arborvitae swamps. In settled areas, there are many wild apple trees which now form a significant food source for deer. Arvon Township has a number of rivers, including the Huron River, which flow into Lake Superior. Because of these factors, the primary economic activities in Arvon Township are related to logging or tourism, particularly hunting and fishing.

<text>L&#x27;Anse ( ) is a village and the county seat of Baraga County, Michigan in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,874 at the 2020 census. The village is located within L&#x27;Anse Township in the Upper Peninsula and partially inside the L&#x27;Anse Indian Reservation.

==History==
This area was long occupied by people of the Lake Superior Band of Ojibwa (Chippewa), who called it &quot;Gichi-wiikwedong&quot;. Much later, French colonists had established a fur trading post here as a part of New France and a Jesuit mission, naming it &quot;L&#x27;Anse&quot;. In French, &quot;L&#x27;Anse&quot; translates as &quot;the cove&quot; or &quot;the bay&quot;, a reference to its location in on the southern portion of L&#x27;Anse Bay, a portion of the larger Keweenaw Bay, at the base of the Keweenaw Peninsula. The modern-day village grew around this French trading post.

Following treaties with the United States in the 19th century, the Ojibwa/Chippewa ceded extensive amounts of land in Michigan. The L&#x27;Anse Indian Reservation was established by the U.S. here as the largest and the oldest in Michigan.

In 1896, the village was completely burned to the ground by a deadly fire which left many homeless.

==History==

The earliest written history of the area now comprising L&#x27;Anse Township dates to October 15, 1660, with the arrival of the first European on record, French Jesuit priest René Menard. Menard spent the winter in what is presently known as Pequaming on Keweenaw Bay, and left the area for Fond du Lac the following spring, never to be heard from again. He was followed by Father Claude in 1666.

Over the next 200 years, the Chippewa tribe populated the area, and attracted the attention of trappers and traders throughout the Great Lakes. The American Fur Company established a trading post at Assinins by a man known only as Dubay. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company had established a post near Zeba in 1836, which operated for about 15 years. Other early settlers included trappers and missionaries.

The first mission in the area was established in 1833 by a Chippewa who had converted to Methodism and taken the name of John Sunday. The first mission was located on the east side of the bay north of L&#x27;Anse at Zeba, with a second opened at Ottawa Lake in 1835. In 1834, Daniel Meeker Chandler left Sault Ste. Marie and headed west on Lake Superior by canoe. He arrived at his destination, called &quot;Ke-Wa-We-Non&quot;, on September 3, and began mission work for the Methodist Church on the east side of Keweenaw Bay. The following summer, Chandler began cutting timber for a proposed Native American village known today as Zeba.

In 1836, a Canadian named Peter (Pierre) Crebassa was appointed as representative trader by the American Fur Company, and moved the post from its original location on the west side of the bay to a site north of L&#x27;Anse at the present day Township Park. Crebassa married a Chippewa girl, Nancy, and they were instrumental in convincing Father Frederic Baraga to establish a Catholic mission, which he founded at Assinins on the west side of Keweenaw Bay in 1843.

When Michigan became the 26th state in 1837, the western two-thirds of the Upper Peninsula were included as a compromise (Ohio received the &quot;Toledo Strip&quot;). In March 1843, the legislature divided the Upper Peninsula into several counties. Three years later, in 1846, the act was amended to make all that part of the state &quot;embraced between the north boundary of township 49, the line between ranges 37 and 38 west and Lake Superior, together with islands in said lake west of the county of Schoolcraft, shall be laid off as a separate county, to be known and designated as the County of Houghton.&quot; The new county included the present-day Keweenaw and Baraga counties, and was organized into three election precincts (townships) at Eagle Harbor, Houghton, and L&#x27;Anse. The following year, the area was reorganized into the townships of Copper Harbor, Eagle Harbor, Houghton, Portage, Algonquin, and L&#x27;Anse, and the first election took place in July 1848.

The coming of railroads spurred growth of the village of L&#x27;Anse in 1871, which prospered for a couple of years until the Panic of 1873.

Algonquin and L&#x27;Anse townships combined in 1875 to form Baraga County, and created the townships of Arvon, Baraga, Covington, Spurr and L&#x27;Anse.

In 1896, the village of L&#x27;Anse burned to the ground, but gradually rebuilt itself into a lumber town with the arrival of the Ford Motor Company in the early 20th century.

<text>Middleville is a village in Thornapple Township, Barry County, in the U.S. state of Michigan. Middleville is part of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area. The population was 4,295 at the 2020 census. 

== History ==
The first white settler to own land in the village was Calvin G. Hill, a native of New York, who bought in 1834 on both sides of the Thornapple River. The village was likely surveyed and subdivided before 1850, but the plat was not officially recorded until 1859. Prior to 1843, the settlement was often called &quot;Thornapple&quot;. The name Middleville was at first given to a post office on the stage coach line between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo. The post office was located at the house of Benjamin S. Dibble in section 2 in northeast Yankee Springs Township. Dibble had agreed to accept the post office at the request of U.S. Representative Lucius Lyon, of Kent County. Lyon suggested the name &quot;Dibbleville&quot;, but Dibble disliked that name. &quot;Middleville&quot; was suggested because of the proximity of an Indian village known as &quot;Middle Village&quot; on Scales Prairie near the boundary line between Thornapple and Yankee Springs townships. Dibble was appointed postmaster in July 1839 and continued until 1842. The next postmaster, John W. Bradley, continued to maintain the post office at Dibble&#x27;s house until 1843, when it was moved to the present village of Middleville, with Calvin G. Hill as the postmaster. The village afterwards became known by the name of the post office. The location of the original Indian village is NNE a few hundred yards of the present day intersection where Norris Rd. ends at Adams Rd.
