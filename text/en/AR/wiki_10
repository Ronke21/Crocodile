<text>Frankfort is a town on the Penobscot River estuary in Waldo County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,231 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Frankfort is the oldest town on the Penobscot River, first settled in the 1760s by Massachusetts soldiers from nearby Fort Pownall. With the end of the French and Indian War, the Penobscot Valley became part of New England, and more specifically Massachusetts, leading to the first cautious encroachments by English-speaking settlers on the lands of the Penobscot Indians. This process, which would begin in Frankfort, would end with the founding of Bangor, Brewer, Orono, Old Town and other inland settlements, and the eventual restriction of the Penobscot people to their major village at &quot;Indian Old Town&quot;, or the present Penobscot Indian Reservation.

Today&#x27;s Frankfort is just a small portion of the original town, which contained the present-day towns of Frankfort, Winterport, Stockton Springs, and Prospect. Ft. Pownall was thus in Frankfort, and the town&#x27;s major village was what is now Winterport. Frankfort was a logical place for settlement not only because Verona Island commanded the approach up the river, but because the river above the town froze during the winter, making this the last ice-free port as one ascended—hence the name &quot;Winterport&quot;.

One of the first settlers was Lt. Joshua Treat (1729–1802), the armorer at Ft. Pownall, whose brother became one of the first settlers of Bangor.

A British fleet anchored off Frankfort in 1814 on its way to sack Bangor and Hampden. The British confiscated provisions from the town and took one ship. The town suffered greatly during the War of 1812 as the British blockade destroyed the coasting trade on which it depended.

In the 19th century an important granite quarry was opened in Frankfort, and the ship-building industry also flourished. The village of Winterport eventually split off to form its own town, however.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Frankfort borders on Swan Lake on the southwest and is drained by the Marsh Stream on its northern border.

The town is crossed by U.S. Route 1A and is bordered on the north by Winterport, on the east by the Penobscot River and across the river, Bucksport, on the south by Prospect and Searsport, on the southwest by Swanville and on the west by Monroe.

Frankfort&#x27;s two highest points are Mt. Waldo and Mosquito Mountain. Mt. Waldo was so named &quot;circa&quot; 1815. Prior to that time, it had been called &quot;Mt. Misery&quot; because two young local men who had attempted to climb it had been overtaken by a blizzard and killed.

<text>Islesboro is a town in Waldo County, Maine, United States, comprising Islesboro Island and several smaller islands. The population was 583 at the 2020 census. It has a summer colony accessible by state ferry service from Lincolnville Beach three miles to the west, by private boat, or by air taxi service. Home to Warren Island State Park, Islesboro includes the village of Dark Harbor.

==History==

The Penobscot people called it Pitaubegwimenahanuk, meaning &quot;the island that lies between two channels&quot;, although André Thevet recorded the name Aiayascon in 1556. It was part of the Waldo Patent. First called Long Island Plantation, it was settled in 1769. It was incorporated as Islesborough on January 28, 1789, although over time the spelling was contracted to Islesboro.

With many harbors and coves, the island was home to the largest commercial shipping fleet in the bay during the 19th century. Following the Civil War, however, Islesboro developed as a resort community, and many large and luxurious summer homes were built. Their large yachts cruised and raced throughout the Gulf of Maine. The town remains an upper-class enclave and summer colony.

==Geography==

===Islands and villages===

Situated in upper Penobscot Bay, the island town separates East from West Penobscot Bay. Islesboro Island is narrow, mainly north-south and 14 miles long. Smaller islands include Job Island, Seven Hundred Acre Island, Spruce Island, Warren Island, Seal Island, Ram Island, Thrumcap, Middle Island, Minot Island, Ensign Island (#1 and #2), Lime Island, Flat Island, Hutchins Island, Little Island, Little Bermuda(?), Joe&#x27;s Rock, and Birch Point. Semi-submerged features include Haskell Ledge, Minor Ledge, and Minot Island Ledge.

The main island consists of two wider landmasses separated by a narrow isthmus called The Narrows. Neighborhoods and villages (small clusters of buildings) are distributed across the two:
* Up Island, the northern landmass
** Pripet, also known as Warren&#x27;s Landing or Beckett&#x27;s Landing – the historic site of a kiln and steamboat wharf
** North Islesboro – historic village and current site of a general store
** Ryder&#x27;s Cove – historic summer vacation spot and steamboat destination
* Down Island, the southern landmass
** Islesboro Village, also known as Guinea Village – near Islesboro Harbor
** Hewes Point – historic summer vacation spot and steamboat destination
** Town Center – town offices, community center, and post office
** Grindle Point – current ferry landing, with historic lighthouse
** Dark Harbor – historic summer vacation spot and steamboat destination

===Size and features===

There is one large pond, called Meadow Pond, in the northern portion of the Island, the work of beavers that have dammed a narrow place. Ice was once harvested from this pond for export to places as far away as India. Hewes Point was named for Paola Hewes, an early pioneer settler.

===Climate===

<text>Liberty is a town in Waldo County, Maine, United States. The population was 934 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The midcoast area of Maine was inhabited by coastal and woodland Native Americans such as the Abenaki (or Wabanaki) until they were mostly dislocated by Europeans beginning in the 17th century.

The first European (English) people moved into the area in and around Liberty in the late 18th century. The first settlement was then known as Davistown Plantation, which is incorporated into neighboring Montville in the early 19th century. Mills in Liberty produced materials that were used in the shipbuilding industry that thrived in nearby coastal towns, such as Waldoboro, during the early 19th century.

In 1827, Liberty separated from Montville and was incorporated as a town.

The middle to late 19th century saw a decline in population and goods produced. This correlates with the decline of the shipbuilding industry.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. 
The largest water body in the town is St. George Lake. Other bodies of water include: Stevens Pond (), Trues Pon (), Little Pond (), Cargill Pond () and Colby Pond (). Liberty is served by Maine State Routes 3, 220, and 173.

<text>Lincolnville is a town in Waldo County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,312 at the 2020 census. Lincolnville is the mainland terminal for Maine State Ferry Service transport to Islesboro.

==History==
Approximately 10,000 years ago, a glacier covered the area to a depth of several thousand feet, carving irregular landforms that survive today. The earliest artifact of European origin was fragments of a 1650–1660 clay pipe, probably a trade good with the native population. First settled in 1770 by Nathan Knight, the town was incorporated in 1802 from Canaan and Ducktrap plantations. It was named for General Benjamin Lincoln, a Revolutionary War General—second-in-command to George Washington at Yorktown—and friend of Henry Knox.

In an 1807 vote to separate from Massachusetts, it was one of three coastal communities to push for separation (with Bath and Brunswick).

On October 22, 1844, local members of the Millerite sect climbed Megunticook Mountain to await the end of the world and the Second Coming. The event was dubbed the Great Disappointment. They hadn&#x27;t prepared for the winter, so other Lincolnville residents housed them to help them survive the winter months.

The first school in Lincolnville was a three-sided log cabin behind Nathan Knight&#x27;s home with a perpendicular ledge for a fourth wall; the ledge served to support a blackboard.

Lamb School was one of the other earlier schools in Lincolnville owned by the Lamb family. It closed in 1912. A sign put up by the Lincolnville Historical Society is now in its place.

Over the years, the population continued to grow until it was incorporated in 1802. A bicentennial celebration was celebrated by the town in 2002.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Located along the western side of Penobscot Bay, Lincolnville is drained by the Ducktrap River. Principal bodies of water include Megunticook Lake, Norton Pond (123 acres), Coleman Pond (225 acres), Moody Pond (61 acres), and Levenseller Pond (34 acres).

The town is served by U.S. Route 1, and Maine State Routes 173, 52, and 235. It is bordered by Belmont on the north, Northport on the northeast, Penobscot Bay on the east, Camden on the south, Hope on the west and Searsmont on the northwest.

<text>Montville is a town in Waldo County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,020 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The area that is now the town of Montville was originally inhabited by the Wawenoec Indians.

Between 1629 and 1631 The Council of New England divided Maine into three major regions, and the region that now contains Montville was purchased by the brigadier general Samuel Waldo, for whom Waldo County is now named. The first evidence of European activity in Montville itself comes from about 1720, when timber was harvested in the area. Among the trees cut were white pines, which were used as ship masts by the British Royal Navy. The first permanent settlement by Europeans in Montville occurred in 1780, when James Davis moved to the area from Massachusetts. The settlement he founded was named the Davistown Plantation, after James Davis, and grew to encompass all of modern day Montville &amp; Liberty. By 1790 there were six families living on the Davistown Plantation, by 1800 that number had grown to 50 families. Davistown was incorporated on February 18, 1807, under the name Montville, the French word for &quot;mountain town&quot;. Twenty years later the southern part of Montville split off, and was incorporated as the town of Liberty.

The patent originally claimed by Samuel Waldo later came under the ownership of Henry Knox, George Washington&#x27;s secretary of war. In the late 18th and early 19th century, there was an ongoing dispute between the settlers of the region and Knox over who held rightful ownership of the land. This was part of a larger conflict between the poor settlers of Mid Coast Maine and the proprietors who owned the land. The settlers believed that ownership of land meant that you had &quot;improved&quot; it by clearing it of trees, planting crops or building fences. Conversely, the proprietors believed that ownership of land was decided by government-granted deeds. The proprietors attempted to divide the land they claimed into lots so that they could tax the settlers there, but the settlers resisted this and banded together to stop surveying in their settlements. The homesteaders called themselves Liberty Men (likely where the town Liberty&#x27;s name comes from), and used mainly intimidation tactics to scare off surveyors who entered into their dominion. On September 5, 1815, a group of Liberty men attacked the Marshall Springs hotel in Montville, in a raid against Joseph H. Pierce Jr, an agent for the twenty associates. The twenty associates were the group that took over Henry Knox&#x27;s land claims after he died in 1806.

Through the first four decades of the 19th century, Montville&#x27;s population rapidly increased. The land was largely deforested, and many farms were started in the area. Sawmills in Montville and Liberty processed wood, which was then transported to the coast to be used in shipbuilding. Montville and Liberty also became a center of coopering, (barrel making) with many of the barrels produced there either being used by fishermen to store their catch, or as lime casts by brick masons in cites to the south, such as Portland, Maine, or Boston, Massachusetts.

Montville reached its peak population in 1840, at which time there were 2,153 people living in the area. After this Montville&#x27;s population went into a steady decline for the next 120 years, reaching its low in 1960 with just 366 people. Its population has since rebounded somewhat, and as of the 2020 census sits at 1,020 people. The drastic decrease in population meant that former farmland was allowed to re-wild, and today the vast majority of Montville&#x27;s land is forested.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Principle bodies of water are Trues Pond (173 acres), Kingdom Bog (90 acres), Ledge Pond (24 acres) and Mud Pond (15 acres). The town is crossed by state routes SR 220 and SR 3. It borders the towns of Knox to the northeast, Morrill to the east, Searsmont to the southeast, Liberty to the southwest, Palermo to the west and Freedom to the northwest. The Town Office is located on 414 Center Road.

Montville is home to part of Frye Mountain Wildlife Management Area. It is also home to part of James Dorso (Ruffingham Meadow) WMA.

<text>Stockton Springs is a town in Waldo County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,533 at the 2020 census. Stockton Springs is home to Fort Point State Park and Fort Point Light, both located on Fort Point, a peninsula on Cape Jellison.

==History==

Part of the Waldo Patent, it was first settled about 1759, the year Governor Thomas Pownall completed Fort Pownall on Fort Point. The defense was intended to guard the mouth of the Penobscot River estuary during the French and Indian War. Fort Pownall was burned in 1775 and 1779 by the British themselves, to prevent it from falling into the hands of Americans.

On February 29, 1794, the area was incorporated as part of Prospect, but then set off and incorporated as a town on March 13, 1857, named Stockton after a port in England. In 1859, businesses included four sawmills, three shingle mills, two lath mills, one carding machine, one cloth-dressing mill, one tannery, four shipyards, six blacksmith shops, and several mechanic shops. By 1886, it also had a shoe factory, cheese factory, a door, sash and blind factory, cask and barrel makers, and a clothing factory. On February 5, 1889, the town&#x27;s name was changed to Stockton Springs in anticipation of bottling local spring water. When sediment was discovered in the bottles, however, the plan was abandoned.

Cape Jellison developed into a bustling port. Between 1905 and 1907, three huge wooden piers were built, the biggest in length. The Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad transported goods to and from the docks. An immense warehouse held potatoes from Aroostook County until schooners could deliver them elsewhere. The wharves were destroyed in a fire on November 8, 1924, ending the harbor&#x27;s industrial era.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Stockton Springs is located on Penobscot Bay, part of the Gulf of Maine, Atlantic Ocean.

The town is crossed by U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 1A and Maine State Route 3.

==History==
The town of Swanville lies within the Muscongus Patent of 1630, which from 1720 was known as the Waldo Patent. It was incorporated on February 19, 1818 (or 1819), following a petition made in November 1816 by James Leach and 37 others. Before that time, it was known variously as &quot;The Plantation of Swan&quot;, &quot;Swan&#x27;s Plantation&quot;, and &quot;Swan&#x27;s Tract&quot;. Late 19th century industries included farming, brick-making, soap-making, and quarrying. The Oak Hill Quarry opened in 1872, producing a dark blue-gray granite that was used for paving stones.

The two largest water bodies in the town are Swan Lake (1364 acres, some of which is in the towns of Searsport and Frankfort), and Toddy Pond (160 acres, some of which is in the town of Brooks.

The Town of Swanville has a dam owned and operated by Maine Hydro, now known as Goose River Hydro, Inc., which also owns the water rights. In 1979, an agreement was brokered between the towns of Swanville, Frankfort, Searsport and Goose River Hydro, Inc.

<text>Codyville is a township in Washington County, Maine, United States, that is part of the unorganized territory of North Washington. The population was 13 at the 2020 census. Codyville was formerly a plantation, but it disorganized in 2019.

==History==
Codyville was named after its first settler and was organized as a plantation in 1872 from Robbins Township (Northern half) and Hingham Academy Grant (Southern Half). After sustaining a steady population decline since the 1930s, the plantation ultimately disorganized in 2019.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the plantation has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.31%, is water.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 19 people, 9 households, and 6 families residing in the plantation. The population density was . There were 25 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the plantation was 100.00% White.

There were 9 households, out of which 11.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, and 33.3% were non-families. 33.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 33.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.11 and the average family size was 2.67.

In the plantation the population was spread out, with 5.3% under the age of 18, 10.5% from 18 to 24, 21.1% from 25 to 44, 47.4% from 45 to 64, and 15.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 50 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.

The median income for a household in the plantation was $68,750, and the median income for a family was $85,139. Males had a median income of $55,417 versus $21,250 for females. The per capita income for the plantation was $21,295. None of the population and none of the families were below the poverty line.

==History==

Many of the major events of Columbia&#x27;s past have been summarized in this section from local texts, newspaper accounts, and from the recollections of residents.

===Native Americans and early settlement===
Prior to settlement from families who originated in southern Maine, Native American settlements had existed along the Pleasant River. One is documented in Maine State records and another was present at Saco Falls. The earliest Euro-American settlers arrived from Addison, then known as Township 6, by traveling up the Pleasant River. The first family was William and Noah Mitchell in the 1750s.

===Government and industry===
The first formal record of government is a petition for a Justice of the Peace in 1770 to the Governor of Massachusetts by persons living in the Pleasant River valley. The town of Columbia was originally known as Township 12. Neighboring Township 13, now Columbia Falls, was joined with Township 12 and incorporated as the Town of Columbia in 1796. This association lasted for 67 years until Columbia Falls incorporated as a separate town in 1863.

In the 1790s, &quot;Lottery Townships&quot; (including Twp 12) sold for 20 cents an acre. Alexander Baring refers to a settlement of about 30 Quaker families located near the center of Township 12. Families supported themselves with sawmills and shipbuilding. The first sawmill in Columbia was in Epping, near the present Fish and Game Club, built by Moses Worcester. It later burned, giving Burnt Mill Rips its name. Others were as follows: Little River, Saco Falls, Branch Brook, Georgetown, Webb District and on the Eastern Branch of Great Marsh Stream. Ship building also took place along Branch Brook.

===Education===
The first school in Township 12 was in Upper Epping. It was moved a few feet and turned into a residence in the early 1990s and it is at 11 Pea Ridge Road. It was used on Sundays to hold meetings. Eventually there were several school districts including Lower and Upper Epping; Saco, below Cynthia Dorr Hill; at the Branch (Four Corners area); Webb District and Georgetown. The only remaining one-room schoolhouse in town was built in 1892. It was renovated in 1996 and is now the Town Office.

===Religion===
The Union Church was built in 1829 and was originally Baptist. The Little River Church, built in 1858, was torn down in 1997. Parts of it are now in the new Faith United Methodist Church on Route 1. The only remnants of the original Quaker settlers are cellar holes in the Pea Ridge Road area.

===Farming, forestry and maritime industries===
The earliest settlers in the Pleasant River Valley came for the marsh hay and the lumber. To enhance the quality of the salt hay, boxes and dikes were built in the marshes to reduce the saltwater content. These were called &quot;aboiteaux&quot;, and that area is now called &quot;the abadors&quot;. As lumber mills sprang up, boat building followed. At one time there were three shipyards at the Branch (Four Corners area). The early settlements near the mills were Epping, Saco Falls, the Branch, Little River, Webb District and Georgetown. There were stores at Epping Corner. When the railroad was built, a settlement grew up near the train station. Here a factory was built for canning blueberries, then string beans and finally freezing fish. The factory burned in 1972, but by that time all the commerce in town had moved out to Route 1 near the Branch.

Blueberries are one of only three fruits native to this area, the others being cranberries and grapes. Native Americans knew that burning the fields in spring helped the crop, and they dried blueberries for pemmican, as well. During the Civil War, berries were hand-picked, hand-canned and soldered for shipping to the Union Army. Berries were also hand picked (for 2 cents a quart) and shipped by schooner in one quart wooden firkins to Boston (the trip took 2½ days). Until 1876, the barrens were held as &quot;common land&quot;, with different families managing different parcels. By the 1880s, there were canning factories in Harrington and Columbia Falls, and a blueberry rake was designed by Abijah Tabbutt in 1883. In 1882 it was voted to &quot;tax blueberry lands based on its value and income.&quot;

The west end of town is mostly the headwaters of the Harrington River, while the east end is in the watershed of the Pleasant River. Development and roads have been established along the higher ground, as there are many wetlands throughout the town. In the 1890s most of the arable lands were in pasture and fields. The blueberry and forestry industries, including Christmas trees and wreath brush, still remain seasonal sources of income for many residents. Some liquidation forestry has taken place, but attempts at subdivision have been largely unsuccessful so far due to lack of jobs in the area. There has been a recent resurgence in small agriculture that should be encouraged if residents want to retain the rural nature of the town.

===Historic structures and land use activities===
The oldest house still standing in Columbia was built in 1790 at 515 Station Road. It is still used as a residence. Schools and churches followed, and the first town &quot;Hall&quot; was built at Lower Epping. It was built as a store, but the second floor was used for public gatherings. It was later known as Leighton&#x27;s Hall, then Redmen&#x27;s Hall. By 1876 Columbia got its own post office (at the Branch). The location changed several times until 1906, when rural delivery started. In 1910, the Columbia Grange was built, later to become the Town Hall. This structure burned in 2001.

The first survey of Columbia (Township 12) was conducted in 1785. In 1857, the Base Line was completed. The Base Line is depicted on Map 2 and refers to a perfectly straight surveyed line, which was one of seven used by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for triangulation to establish positions for mapping the North Atlantic. The Eastern Monument was heavily vandalized and is now stored at the Cherryfield Historical Society.

In 1940, the dike bridge was built that crosses the West Branch of the Pleasant River in Addison. Clappers were installed to prevent tides from coming up river so that the West Branch would become fresh water only.

In 1963, Pine Island was subdivided. Elio Carerj purchased the Columbia portion of Pine Island (which is in the middle of the Great Heath) from Maurice Worcester for $1,000 on August 17, 1963. Doing business as Atlantic Real Estate, he subdivided his land into 673 individual -acre lots on 40 blocks. He sold about half of them for between $40 and $160 per lot, mostly to citizens of Germany, Switzerland and Italy. At that time, there was a bridge across the Pleasant River from El Meadow.

===Transportation===

In 1898, the Washington County Railroad came to the area. The station in Columbia was on Station Road on the north side of the tracks. The use of the rail lines diminished substantially in the 1950s and 1960s, and the rail line was declared exempt in 1986. This was a result of more inexpensive trucking costs on the interstate highway system. U.S. Route 1 is now the main arterial route in Columbia and the southern part of Washington County. It was completed in 1953.

==Historical buildings and places==
The Maine Historic Preservation Commission maintains an inventory of important sites including buildings or sites on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). They record one listing for the town: Columbia Union Church on Epping Rd.

Columbia Streets and Public Facilities are of historic importance to the town&#x27;s residents:

*Geodetic Survey East Base Line Marker (1857, east end of Base Line Road)
*Ichabod White House () The front half of the house was purchased in 1900 from Sears and Roebuck.
*House at 515 Station Road (1790)

==Cemeteries==

Cemeteries are a cultural resource, providing insight into the history of the community.

* Columbia Cemetery – only one owned by town, approximately, on Cemetery Road off Saco Road.
* Mailley Hill Cemetery, , mile up Station Road on west side.
* Nash Cemetery, acre, Route 1, south side next to Wright Construction.
* Friendship Cemetery, , north side Sacarap Road just past Barney Brook.

These four are in current use, and the town holds monies for their maintenance. The town&#x27;s older cemeteries contain tombstones dating back to the early 19th century. They are as follows:
* McCaslin Cemetery, 60 ft × 100 ft, in the woods north of Route 1 across from Delia’s store
* White Cemetery, 50 ft × 60 ft, (0.55 mile from town line) Route 1, south side.
* Unnamed cemetery, unfenced, approx 30 ft × 45 ft, contains grave of Civil War veteran Moses Nash, down a dirt road north side of Sacarap Road mile before Georgetown Woods Road.
* Randall Cemetery, 50 ft × 60 ft, west side Sacarap Road, just before Great Marsh Stream.
* Valley Cemetery, 100 ft × 100 ft, west side (left off Valley Road)

There is one old family cemetery (Furren) whose gravestones could not be found, north of
Route 1 behind the new Faith United Methodist Church. There are a few new family plots on
private property.

==Archaeological sites==

There is one known prehistoric archaeological site located within Columbia, according to the Maine Historic Preservation Commission (MHPC). This site (60.10) is located on the edge of the blueberry barrens. The shoreline of the Pleasant River, Schoodic Lake, kettle hole ponds and the south margin of the blueberry barrens have been determined by MHPC to be archeologically sensitive areas that are worth professionally surveying. There are no known historical archeological sites within Columbia, as recorded by the MHPC however some sites have been identified by residents including the silica mines, various mill sites, the baseline and the bean factory.

==Location and topography==
Columbia is located in the western part of Washington County. The town is situated approximately east of Bangor and is bordered on the north by unorganized territory (T18 MD BPP), on the east by Columbia Falls, on the south by Harrington and Addison, and on the west by Cherryfield. The land area of the town is approximately .

==Geology==
Columbia is located in a region of massive granite intrusion that was glaciated in the Wisconsin age. The glacier caused till (unsorted, poorly drained soil) to be deposited over the entire region. This poorly drained till formed bogs and ponds and altered the drainage pattern. The underlying granite caused the till to be more thickly deposited on the northwest sides of ridges: on the southeast sides boulders were &quot;plucked&quot; and transported further south. Thick till deposits are also found in bedrock &quot;valleys&quot; and depressions. The weight of the ice (in some places a mile thick) caused the land to be depressed in relation to the level of the sea. Marine sediments (silts and clays) were deposited in valleys and more sheltered locations. The release of pressure due to the melting allowed the land to rise slowly. This explains why silt and clay deposits can be found at elevations of or more. Columbia contains the largest and most significant areas of marine outwash plain resulting in regionally significant deposits of sand and gravel.

==Blueberry cultivation==
The most significant agricultural activity in Columbia is blueberry production. There are approximately under cultivation for blueberries, of which are irrigated. While the soils in Columbia are not ideal for many agricultural uses, they are well suited for blueberry production, and this activity continues to provide significant employment in town.

==Water resources==

===Watersheds===
Within its boundaries, the town of Columbia has one great pond, Schoodic Lake (also in Cherryfield and T18 MD BPP). The water resources of Columbia are characterized primarily by the Pleasant River and several other watersheds.

The headwaters of the Harrington River rise in the western part of Columbia, comprising the sub-watersheds of Trout Brook, Great Marsh Stream and several smaller tributaries leading directly to the Harrington River. The northwestern part of this watershed contains Pineo Ridge and a large sand and gravel aquifer, with potential yields of than 50 gallons per minute. The southern part of this watershed is primarily forested but is an area where significant clearcuts have occurred recently as timberland is converted to wreath brush production.

The other watersheds in Columbia contain the main stem of the Pleasant River in the northern part of town, including the Great Heath described below. The West Branch of the Pleasant River rises in two sub-watersheds in the southeastern part of Columbia and drains south toward Addison.

The portion of the watershed that has the greatest potential to affect a body of water is its direct watershed, or that part which does not first drain through upstream areas. Anything that can be transported by water will eventually reach and impact the quality of a water body. Development activities, such as house and road construction and timber harvesting, may disturb the land that drains to a lake by streams and groundwater and contribute pollutants and other substances to water bodies, degrading water quality. Activity anywhere in the watershed, even several miles away, has the potential to impact the water quality of our streams, rivers, ponds and lakes.

Threats to water quality come from point and non-point discharges. Point source pollution is discharged directly from a specific site such as a municipal sewage treatment plant or an industrial outfall pipe. There are no point source discharges within the Town of Columbia.

Non-point source pollution poses the greatest threat to water quality in Maine communities, and Columbia is no exception. The most significant contributing source comes from erosion and sedimentation as well as excessive run-off of nutrients, particularly phosphorus. In excessive quantities phosphorus acts as a fertilizer and causes algae to flourish or &quot;bloom&quot;. Additional contributing factors include animal wastes, fertilizers, sand and salt storage, waste lagoons, faulty septic systems, roadside erosion, leaking underground storage tanks, and hazardous substances.

Identification and regulation of these sites is important to safeguard both surface and ground waters. The non-point source pollution in Columbia caused by failing septic systems, run-off from surrounding agricultural land, and aerial spraying of herbicides threatens Schoodic Lake and kettle hole ponds, the Pleasant River and the headwaters of the Harrington River (Great Marsh Stream and Dorr and Trout Brooks). A small area along the western edge of the town drains to the Narraguagus River via Schoodic Lake. Camp development and blueberry agriculture could pose a serious threat to the water quality of this cold water lake.

According to the ME-DEP Lake Water Quality Monitoring Report for Schoodic Lake provided by the PEARL spatial database, water quality monitoring data for Schoodic Lake has been collected since 1977.

During this period, five years of basic chemical information was collected, in addition to eight years of Secchi Disk Transparencies (SDT). In summary, the water quality of Schoodic Lake is considered to be average, based on measures of SDT, total phosphorus (TP), and Chlorophyll-a (Chla). The potential for nuisance algal blooms on Schoodic Lake is low.

Schoodic Lake is a non-colored lake (average color 8 SPU) with an average SDT of 5.5 m (18 ft). The range of water column TP for Schoodic Lake is 4–15 parts per billion (ppb) with an average of 9 ppb, while Chla ranges from 2.1 to 4.5 ppb, with an average of 3 ppb. Recent dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles show moderate DO depletion in deep areas of the lake. The potential for TP to leave the bottom sediments and become available to algae in the water column (internal loading) is low to moderate.

Schoodic Lake is managed by the Maine Department of Inland Fish and Wildlife as both a warm water and cold-water fishery. Oxygen levels below 5 parts per million stress certain cold water fish, and a persistent loss of oxygen may eliminate or reduce habitat for sensitive cold water species. The outlet of Schoodic Brook hosts a run of rainbow smelts that are dipped by locals and provide forage for landlocked salmon.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Machias is administering federal USDA funds in a small watersheds program known as PL566. The program focus is the Pleasant and Narraguagus River Watersheds and they are in Phase one of a three phase process that conducts an assessment of issues and concerns in the watershed (Phase I), involves stakeholders in the creation of a management plan and response to the issues (Phase II), and seeks implementation resources (Phase III) to address watershed concerns. It is a flexible program that allows funds to be directed to municipalities and not just landowners or individual producers. Columbia could participate in this process and ensure that all available resources can be tapped in support of town goals.

Water withdrawals for irrigation of agricultural crops are of concern to some residents and there is discussion of the town regulating water withdrawals from surface waters. There are commercial production wells in the northwestern part of Columbia and surface water withdrawals also occur from Schoodic Lake, Duck Pond and Myers Pond. Surface water withdrawals in Cherryfield from Crane Pond are also of concern as these are the headwaters of the Harrington River tributaries that flow through Columbia. Concerns include the long-term impact of withdrawals of low water on Atlantic Salmon and other aquatic species such as native brook trout. The state legislature resolved in 2001, by Public Law 619 not to regulate water withdrawals in organized townships. Instead they chose to study the amounts and uses of existing water withdrawals and to develop a reporting system to gather this information. Columbia would like such studies to include the rivers within their boundaries.

===Rivers, streams, and brooks===

As defined by Maine&#x27;s Natural Resources Protection Act, a river, stream, or brook is a channel that has defined banks (including a floodway and associated flood plain wetlands) created by the action of the surface water. Columbia’s rivers, streams and brooks include:

# Pleasant River, main stem (Pleasant River Watershed)
# Pleasant River, west branch (Pleasant River Watershed)
# Western Little River (Pleasant River Watershed)
# Trout Brook (Harrington River Watershed)
# Dorr Brook (Harrington River Watershed)
# Great Marsh Stream (Harrington River Watershed)
# Barney Brook (Harrington River Watershed)
# Bells Brook (West Branch Pleasant River Watershed)
# Branch Brook (West Branch Pleasant River Watershed)

==Present land use regulations==
Apart from the state-required minimums, the town of Columbia has a limited set of regulatory measures to affect the nature and pattern of development. Building permits are required. As noted in the housing chapter an ordinance was adopted on June 23, 1997, requiring the filing of a plan for building. Its stated purpose is to adopt an informational building permit to inform the town of impending growth and to regulate lot size (to not less than one acre). The defeat of a more complex ordinance a year later led to the mistaken belief that the 1997 ordinance had no effect. A notice will go out with the 2003 tax bill informing residents that the 1997 ordinance is in effect.

===Development pressure===
Columbia has experienced significant commercial growth along the Route 1 corridor, primarily in the Four Corners area. In addition to this commercial concentration on Route 1 the area known as Epping in the northeast corner of town contains the municipal offices, home based businesses and historic structures. Most new residential development has occurred along Webb District Road and Georgetown. In the absence of any permitting process in Columbia any individual lot can be developed throughout the town.

As in other towns in Washington County, large parcels of timberland are changing hands and undergoing intensive harvest. These lands are being converted from timber stands to wreath brush production. To date this conversion is in compliance with the Forest Practices Act. There is very little large scale subdivision activity in Columbia with only one large subdivision, Pine Island in the Great Heath, and a 5 lot subdivision for affordable house lots on Webb District Road, and a 7 lot subdivision on Carberry Road, which is off Sacarap Road.

There are no schools in Columbia and overall enrollment is declining. Because of the town&#x27;s geography and population distribution, resident children attend two elementary schools, each in neighboring towns.

<text>Columbia Falls is a town in Washington County, Maine, United States. The population was 476 at the 2020 census.

It derives its name from the Class I-III Rapids on the Pleasant River (Pleasant Bay) that flow through the town. Columbia Falls and its Washington County neighbor Columbia, Maine were once the same town. However in 1863 Columbia Falls formed its own town. 

In 2023 the community gained national attention after a proposal to build the world&#x27;s tallest flagpole (1,461 feet (445 meters) high -- taller than the Empire State Building) -- in a $1 billion project that includes a 4,000 seat auditorium in dubbed the Flagpole of Freedom Park. 

The project has been proposed by local businessman Morrill Worcester whose company Worcester Wreath Co. which expanded to Wreaths Across America and donates more than one million wreaths to military cemeteries and gravesites around the world.

==History==

The town began as Township 13 SD, BPP, which was joined together with Township 12 by the Massachusetts General Court on February 8, 1796, and incorporated as Columbia. It was settled soon after the Revolutionary War. On March 25, 1863, the town was set off from Columbia and incorporated as Columbia Falls.

Lumbering and shipbuilding brought the town prosperity and endowed it with some fine early architecture. This includes the Ruggles House (1818–1820), an exquisite Federal home that is now a museum, and the Union Church (1849), a Greek Revival meeting house which since 1902 has housed the town hall, library and archives. The Washington County Railroad arrived at Columbia Falls in 1898. Tourism and harvesting blueberries are important industries today, together with producing Christmas trees and wreaths.

==Geography==

<text>Eastport is a city and archipelago in Washington County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,288 at the 2020 census, making Eastport the least-populous city in Maine. The principal island is Moose Island, which is connected to the mainland by a causeway. Eastport is the easternmost city in the continental United States (although the nearby town of Lubec is the easternmost municipality).

==History==

The native Passamaquoddy Tribe has called this area home for at least 10,000 years. Some archeologists estimate the habitation at 20,000 years. The first known European contact was the St. Croix colony founded by the French explorer Samuel de Champlain in 1604. Near present-day Calais, the unsuccessful Saint Croix Island Acadia settlement predates the first successful English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia, by three years. On June 25, 1604, Champlain and his men spent a long and severe winter on St. Croix Island with no fresh water and diminished supplies. Two-fifths of the men died of scurvy, and the colony moved across the Bay of Fundy to Port Royal in present-day Nova Scotia.

Fishermen and traders visited the area in the 17th century. Moose Island was first settled in 1772 by James Cochrane of Newburyport, Massachusetts, who would be joined by other fishermen from Newburyport and Portsmouth, New Hampshire. On February 24, 1798, Eastport was incorporated as a town from Plantation Number 8 PS by the Massachusetts General Court, and named for being the easternmost port in the United States. Lubec, on the mainland, was set off and incorporated as a town on June 21, 1811.

From 1807 to 1809, the town was a center of extensive two-way smuggling during the Embargo Act imposed by President Thomas Jefferson. In 1809, Fort Sullivan was erected atop a village hill, but it was captured by a British fleet under command of Sir Thomas Hardy on July 11, 1814, during the War of 1812 as part of the initiative to establish the colony of New Ireland. England claimed that Moose Island was on the British side of the international border which had been determined in 1783. Nevertheless, the town was returned to the control of the United States in 1818. The boundary between the U.S. and Canada in the area remained disputed until settled by the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842. Eastport is the location most recently occupied by a foreign country in the contiguous United States.

In 1833, Eastport was the second largest trading port in the country after New York City. Farms produced hay and potatoes. Industries included a grain mill, box factory and carding mill. But the island&#x27;s economy was primarily directed at the sea. With tides of about , Eastport&#x27;s spacious harbor remained ice-free year round. The first sardine factory was built here about 1875. The population grew with the emergence of the sardine fishery and related canning businesses, which studded the shoreline by the end of the 19th century. By 1886, the town contained 13 sardine factories, which operated day and night during the season, and produced approximately 5,000 cases per week. About 800 men, women and children worked in the plants. Eastport would be incorporated as a city on March 3, 1893. But the fishing industry would decline, and many people moved away. Indeed, the city went bankrupt in 1937. In 1976, the Groundhog Day Gale destroyed many structures along the waterfront. Today, catching fish remains the principal industry, although tourism has become important as well.

Eastport is a port of entry. An international ferry crosses to Deer Island, New Brunswick, during the summer months. Each 4th of July, the city becomes a destination for thousands of celebrants. Navy ships have docked there during the 4th of July celebration for many years. Eastport celebrated its bicentennial in 1998. Each September, the city hosts the annual Maine Salmon Festival in the historic downtown district. There is also a Pirate Festival the weekend after Labor Day, 2023 marks the 19th year of the festival.

==Celebrations==
===Independence Day===
Independence Day in Eastport includes &quot;Old Home Week&quot;, a celebration of the birth of both Canada and the United States, which traditionally begins on Canada Day and continues through U.S. Independence Day. Eastport hosts the largest Fourth of July celebration in Maine. Events include the Grand Independence Parade (with considerable participation of its Canadian neighbors), fireworks over the Bay of Fundy, free entertainment at Overlook Park, greasy pole and water sports, an antique car show, and contests and games for all ages with prizes. Since 1905, U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard ships have made a port call over the 4th and provided free tours.

===New Year&#x27;s Eve===
Beginning in 2004, Eastport began the new year with the drop of a sardine and maple leaf.

<text>Jonesport is a town in Washington County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,245 at the 2020 census. Jonesport is a fishing and lobstering town. It contains the villages or hamlets of Jonesport, Mason Bay, Monsapec, and West Jonesport.

==History==

Settled before the American Revolution, Jonesport was part of a grant of made by the Massachusetts General Court in 1789 to John C. Jones and others. It was incorporated on March 4, 1809, as Jonesborough. On February 3, 1832, a portion of Jonesborough was set off and incorporated as Jones&#x27; Port. Then a portion of Jonesport was set off and incorporated on April 7, 1925, as the island town of Beals, accessible by bridge, built in 1958, across the Moosabec Reach.

Located on a peninsula out in the Gulf of Maine, the town&#x27;s principal industries are fishing, boat building, harvesting blueberries, and tourist services. Jonesport includes many uninhabited islands which provide nesting areas for eider, cormorants, seagulls, razorbills, guillemots, loons, black scoters, grebes and eagles. There are two nature preserves: Western Brothers Island and the Great Wass Archipelago (which includes Great Wass Island), the latter shared with the town of Beals.

In 1866, a group of Christian restorationists sailed from Jonesport to Ottoman-occupied Palestine in the hope of preparing the land for the Jews to return, thereby hastening the coming of the Christian Messiah. The Maine Friendship House, a small, wooden clapboard New England–style house built by one of those families, still stands in modern Tel Aviv.

<text>Lubec ( ) is a town in Washington County, Maine, United States. It is the easternmost municipality in the contiguous U.S. (see extreme points of the United States) and is the country&#x27;s closest continental location to Africa.

The town, with a population of 1,237 at the 2020 census, is home to Quoddy Head State Park.

==History==

Located on a peninsula overlooking an ice-free harbor, the town was first settled about 1775. Originally part of Eastport, it was set off and incorporated on June 21, 1811, and named for Lübeck, Germany. Following the War of 1812, Lubec was the site of considerable smuggling trade in gypsum, although principal industries remained agriculture and fisheries. By 1859, there was a tannery, three gristmills and nine sawmills; by 1886, there were also two shipyards, three boatbuilders and three sailmakers.

From 1897 to 1898, the town was the site of a swindle in the sale of stock in the Electrolytic Marine Salts Company, the brainchild of Reverend Prescott Jernegan and Charles Fisher of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Jernegan claimed to have developed a method of using &quot;accumulators&quot; to get gold from sea water, and bought an old grist mill to turn it into a factory. The scheme attracted an abundance of investors, who were all too eager to funnel money into the company after being promised astronomical returns. In the summer of 1898, work was suspended without explanation. Jernegan and Smith vanished, and the fraud was gleefully exposed by newspapers across New England.

Lubec reached its population peak in the 1910s and 1920s, hovering a little above 3,300. Since then, the population has generally been in a gradual but steady decline. As of 2020, its population had fallen to 1,237.

==Geography==
Lubec is located in northeastern Maine, at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Lubec is located on a peninsula in Passamaquoddy Bay, slightly south of Eastport. The West Quoddy Head is southeast.

Lubec is the easternmost town of the contiguous United States. West Quoddy Head in Lubec is the easternmost point in the contiguous United States, located at longitude. It is adjacent to the Quoddy Narrows, a narrow strait between Canada and the United States, one of the entrances into Passamaquoddy Bay. Since 1808, West Quoddy Head Lighthouse has been on the site to guide ships through this waterway. The present lighthouse with its distinctive red-and-white stripes was built in 1858.

Lubec is crossed by Maine State Route 189. The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge connects the town to Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada.

==Bay of Fundy International Marathon==
The Bay of Fundy International Marathon is a marathon between Lubec and Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada. A 10K is also organized alongside the marathon. The 10K takes place entirely within Lubec.

The race begins at West Quoddy Head Lighthouse, which is the easternmost point in the United States. Runners cross the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge connecting Maine to New Brunswick and run until they reach Head Harbour Lighthouse (East Quoddy Lighthouse), at which time the runners turn around and return to Lubec.

The first marathon was run in 2013. It included over 500 registered runners and was held in June. The race provided significant economic benefits to the area. The 2014 edition featured fewer runners (286 total). The organizers attributed the decrease to the &quot;Boston effect&quot;, whereby marathon runners chose other marathons to run in order to qualify for the 2014 Boston Marathon.

==Climate==
Lubec has a humid continental climate with mild summers and cold winters. Generally speaking, it is relatively cold for its coastline position at 44 degrees latitude, but milder in winter than nearby Machias due to moderate warming by the adjacent waters of the Atlantic. The climate is similar to that of nearby Eastport. The Weather Channel provides interpolated climate data based on nearby areas.

<text>Machiasport is a town in Washington County, Maine, United States. The population was 962 at the 2020 census. Machiasport is a historic seaport and tourist destination.

==History==

In 1633, the Plymouth Company established a trading post here to conduct business with the Native Americans. But this was part of Acadia, territory which New France considered its own. So in 1634, the trading post was sacked by French forces from Port Royal under the command of Charles de Saint-Étienne de la Tour.
In 1770, the area was granted by the Massachusetts General Court to 80 petitioners, 54 from Scarborough. It was first part of Machias, incorporated in 1784, then set off and incorporated as Machiasport in 1826.

In 1775, following the capture of the British ship HMS &quot;Margaretta&quot; by locals under leadership of Jeremiah O&#x27;Brien, the residents built a small breastworks here to guard the mouth of the Machias River and the area settlements. Later that year, the British sent four ships under the command of Sir George Collier that defeated the local militia, destroyed the breastworks, and burned several buildings. In 1777, the fort was rebuilt as a crescent shaped four-gun battery. In 1781 it was made part of the national defense and named Fort O&#x27;Brien. In 1808–1809, Lemuel Trescott of Eastport oversaw the construction of a blockhouse, barracks and battery. During the War of 1812, in September 1814 the British captured the fort and burnt the barracks.

In 1863, during the American Civil War, Fort Machias was built adjacent to the ruins of Fort O&#x27;Brien. It was a five-gun earthworks fort with Napoleon 12-pound cannon. It was actively manned from 1863 to 1865. In 1923, the U.S. government transferred the sites of both forts to the state of Maine. As of 2006, they are managed as a historic site by the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands. In 1969, they were added to the National Register of Historic Places, as structure #69000024.

Machiasport has been the setting of several ethnographic documentary films about its inhabitants by the anthropologist and filmmaker Anna Grimshaw.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Drained by the Machias River, the town is located at the head of Machias Bay on the Gulf of Maine, part of the Atlantic Ocean.

The town is crossed by state routes 92 and 191. It is bordered by the towns of East Machias to the north, Whiting to the northeast, Machias to the west, and (separated by water) is near Cutler to the east, and Roque Bluffs to the southwest.

<text>Robbinston is a town in Washington County, Maine, United States. The population was 539 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. It is situated northeast of Machias, north of Lubec and south of Calais.

==History==
Robbinston is in Washington County, the easternmost of the United States. As it was settled, the areas, or &quot;Plantations&quot; were numbered, and then became villages and cities. It was named for Edward Hutchinson Robbins and Nathaniel J. Robbins who received a land grant for the area on October 21, 1786, and became the third and fourth family settled there. A post office was established by 1796, and Robbinston was incorporated on February 18, 1811.

The area near Robbinston was first settled by the French explorer Pierre de Monts from 1604 to 1605 and then abandoned when the colony lost 36 people that first winter. That island, once called De Mont&#x27;s Island, then the Neutral Island, is now the St. Croix Island International Historic Site. It marks the boundary between the United States and Canada as set out by treaty in 1783. Traces of the fort were first excavated in 1798, then the St. Croix Lighthouse was installed in 1856 at the head of Passamaquoddy Bay where it meets the St. Croix River. It now has seven life-sized historical statues as part of the park walk.

The river is wide separating Robbinston from the town of St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Canada. Still saltwater, the tidal range is . Because of the abundance of wood, much of the early industry centered around shipbuilding. For example, in 1856, 17 vessels, ranging from 100 to 1000 tons each, were built at Robbinston. When steam-powered ships arrived, Robbinston returned to fishing and farming potatoes, which escaped the blight found in warmer areas. The granite quarry in Red Beach also was a local industry. The seven lakes and streams in Robbinston boasted pickerel, trout, perch and salmon.

During the mid-19th century, Robbinston was a last stop for the Underground Railroad where escaping slaves would cross over into Canada and freedom. One of the houses that supported them still stands, the John N. Brewer Sr Mansion. Built in 1785 with an addition added around 1821, it is on the National Register of Historic Places. The John N. M. Brewer Jr House built in 1826 is across hwy 1 and is now operated as a B&amp;B. Other historical sites in Robbinston are the Grace Episcopal Church, James S. Pike Racing Milestones, Pulpit Rock, Henrietta Brewer Cottage (wife of John Brewer Jr) (Redclyffe Shore Motel) and Sewall Memorial Congregational Church, with its roots in 1817.

Up five miles along Coastal Route 1 is Devil&#x27;s Head, a high rocky bluff overlooking the river and landmark for watercraft. There is a nice trail and picnic site next to the water. The highest lookout point, at above sea level, is Trimble Mountain, off Brewer Road. The three islands are accessible by boat, which can be rented or hired. 

Many people have family historical roots in the area and visit for business as well as pleasure. The Washington County Historical Society is best contacted in advance, since many of the records are held in the larger towns and are more easily navigated with a little direction.

<text>Vanceboro is a town in Washington County, Maine, United States. The town was named after landowner William Vance. The main village in town is located at the eastern terminus of Maine State Route 6. Vanceboro is across the St. Croix River from St. Croix, New Brunswick, Canada, to which it is connected by the Saint Croix–Vanceboro Bridge. Vanceboro is also connected to St. Croix by the Saint Croix–Vanceboro Railway Bridge, which is used by the New Brunswick Southern Railway.

The population was 102 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Vanceboro was selected as the border crossing for the European and North American Railway (E&amp;NA) between Bangor, Maine, and Saint John, New Brunswick, during surveys in the 1860s.

This line was opened by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and Governor General of Canada Lord Lisgar during a ceremony at the border in October 1871. In 1882, the E&amp;NA&#x27;s rail line from Vanceboro to Bangor was leased by the Maine Central Railroad. In 1889, the MEC&#x27;s rail line through Vanceboro became part of the transcontinental network of the Canadian Pacific Railway following construction of the International Railway of Maine. In 1955 the MEC purchased the entire line from the E&amp;NA shareholders, and in 1974 the CPR purchased the line through Vanceboro from the MEC. On January 1, 1995, CPR sold the line through Vanceboro to the New Brunswick Southern Railway, which operates as the Eastern Maine Railway in the United States.
On February 2, 1915, Lt. Werner Horn, a German army reservist, bombed the international railway bridge crossing the St. Croix River from Vanceboro into Canada in an unsuccessful attempt to sabotage the CPR line across Maine; it was alleged that the railway was being used to transport war material across the then-neutral United States territory.

<text>Acton is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,671 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of Acton, Miller Corner and South Acton. The town is home to the Acton Fairground, which holds the Acton Fair every late summer. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
It was part of the extensive Ossipee Tract sold on November 28, 1668, by Newichawannock Chief Captain Sunday (or Wesumbe) to Francis Small, a trader from Kittery. Small sold a half interest in the tract to Major Nicholas Shapleigh of Eliot. In 1770, heirs found the unrecorded deed and divided the land, with Shapleigh&#x27;s descendants awarded one half of Limerick and all of Parsonsfield and Shapleigh. First called Hubbardstown Plantation, Shapleigh was in 1785 incorporated and named in honor of Nicholas Shapleigh. Its western portion was set off and incorporated on March 6, 1830, as Acton, named after Acton, England.
The town was first settled at Acton village in 1776 by Benjamin Kimens, Clement Steele and John York, all from York. In 1779, Joseph Parsons built a gristmill on the Salmon Falls River near Wakefield, New Hampshire. Other mills followed at Acton&#x27;s various water power sites, including sawmills, gristmills, a hemp mill, a carding mill, a felt mill, a tannery and a shoe factory. In 1877, a vein of silver was discovered near Goding Creek and the Lebanon border. Prospectors dug mines during the 1880s, after which the enterprise declined.

Although much of the soil was poor for farming, the ridges yielded good crops. In 1866, the Shapleigh &amp; Acton Agricultural Society was formed and commenced sponsoring an annual fair and cattle show. It continues each late summer as the Acton Fair.

The last living member of the Battle of Bunker Hill, Ralph Farnham, lived in Acton for 80 years before his death in 1860 at the age of 104.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Acton is drained by the Little Ossipee River, the Mousam River and the Salmon Falls River. The highest elevation in town is Hussey Hill, above sea level. Hussey Hill is also Maine&#x27;s southernmost mountain and only elevation above 1,000 feet in town.

The town is crossed by State Route 109. Acton borders the towns of Newfield to the north, Shapleigh to the east, Lebanon to the south, Sanford to the southeast, and the New Hampshire towns of Milton to the west and Wakefield to the northwest.

<text>Alfred is a town in York County, Maine, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 3,073. Alfred is the seat of York County, and home to part of the Massabesic Experimental Forest. National Register of Historic Places has two listings in the town, the Alfred Historic District, with 48 houses, and the Alfred Shaker Historic District.

Villages in the town include Alfred, Alfred Mills, and North Alfred. The town is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

Abenaki Native Americans called the area Massabesic, meaning &quot;large pond,&quot; or &quot;the place of much water.&quot; It was in the western portion of a large tract of land purchased from Indian chiefs Fluellin, Hombinowitt and Meeksombe (also known as Captain Sunday), between 1661 and 1664 by Major William Phillips, an owner of mills in Saco (which then included Biddeford). According to historian Jim Brunelle, editor of the &quot;Maine Almanac,&quot; the price was &quot;two large blankets, two gallons of rum, two pounds of powder, four pounds of musket balls, 20 strings of beads and several other articles.&quot;

Simeon Coffin of Newbury, Massachusetts, arrived in 1764 and lived for a time in a wigwam, although the first permanent settlement took place in 1770. Known as the north parish of Sanford, the community was set off and incorporated as a district on February 4, 1794. Sawmills and gristmills operated by water power at the streams. A log jail was built in 1803, with a brick jail in 1869. The courthouse was built in 1806, the year Alfred became the shire town of York County. It was incorporated as a town in 1808, named in honor of King Alfred the Great. Land would be set off to Sanford in 1828, and annexed from Waterboro in 1847. The Rochester &amp; Portland Railroad entered from Waterboro in 1864, connecting to Rochester, New Hampshire in 1871. More than 30 trains passed through Alfred daily between 1910 and 1920, but use would decline in the age of automobiles. Passenger service ceased in 1949, with the final train departing in 1961. A severe drought in Maine tindered the Great Fires of 1947, burning of woodland and two residences in the town.
A Shaker religious community once thrived in Alfred (now the Alfred Shaker Historic District). In 1783, members of the Shaker Church settled on the hill near Massabesic (now Shaker) Pond. Others dubbed them the &quot;Merry Dancers,&quot; because of their ecstatic worship. &quot;They were,&quot; as historian George J. Varney writes, &quot;at this time fanatical in religion and intemperate in their indulgences.&quot;

In 1872, the District No. 5 School was built in northern Alfred. It was used as a school until 1921, thereafter providing a number of community functions. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

In 1873 Louis H. F. Wagner rowed out to Smuttynose Island in the Isles of Shoals, off the Atlantic coast near Kittery, intending to rob but eventually murdering two of the three women left alone on the island. When the authorities finally caught up with him, jurisdiction for the case was given to York County and the county seat, Alfred. The biggest trial in the state at that time was held in the Alfred Court House.

Having little defense, Wagner was quickly found guilty and sentenced to be hanged on the gallows of the Maine State Prison at Thomaston. While awaiting transfer, he broke out of the Alfred jail and made his escape, eventually being caught in Farmington, New Hampshire.

This 1616 landing by a European antedates the &quot;Mayflower&quot; landing in Plymouth, Massachusetts, (located 100 miles to the south) by about four years, a fact overlooked in much of New England lore. In 1630, the Plymouth Company granted the land south of the River Swanckadocke to Dr. Vines and John Oldham. In 1653, the town included both sides of the river, and was incorporated by the Massachusetts General Court as Saco.

Biddeford was first incorporated as the Town of Saco in 1653. Roger Spencer was granted the right in 1653 to build the first sawmill. Lumber and fish became the community&#x27;s chief exports. In 1659, Major William Phillips of Boston became a proprietor, and constructed a garrison and mill at the falls. Settlers withdrew to Winter Harbor for safety, and their homes and mills upriver at the falls were burned. In 1693, a stone fort was built a short distance below the falls, but it was allegedly captured by Native Americans in 1703, when 11 colonists were killed and 24 taken captive to Canada. In 1688, Fort Mary was built near the entrance to Biddeford Pool. The town was reorganized in 1718 as Biddeford, after Bideford, a town in Devon, England, from which some settlers had emigrated. After the Fall of Quebec in 1759, hostilities with the indigenous people ceased. During King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675, the town, once again, was allegedly attacked by Native Americans. 

In 1762, the land northeast of the river was set off as Pepperellborough, which in 1805 was renamed Saco. The first bridge to Saco was built in 1767. The river divides into two falls that drop , providing water power for mills. Factories were established to make boots and shoes. The developing mill town also had granite quarries and brickyards, in addition to lumber and grain mills. Major textile manufacturing facilities were constructed along the riverbanks, including the Laconia Company in 1845, and the Pepperell Company in 1850. Biddeford was incorporated as a city in 1855.

The mills attracted waves of immigrants, including the Irish, Albanians, and French-Canadians from Quebec. At one time, the textile mills employed as many as 12,000 people, but as happened elsewhere, the industry entered a long period of decline. As of 2009, the last remaining textile company in the city, WestPoint Home, closed. The property occupying the mill has been sold and is being redeveloped into housing and new businesses. The last log drive down the Saco River was in 1943, with the last log sawed in 1948. Biddeford&#x27;s name is engraved near the top level of The Pilgrim Monument, in Provincetown, Massachusetts, along with the names of some of the oldest cities and towns in New England.

During World War II, the Biddeford Pool Military Reservation was established from 1942 to 1945, on what is now the Abenakee Golf Club. It had four circular concrete platforms called &quot;Panama mounts&quot; for 155-mm guns, three of which remain today.

The city is crossed by Interstate 95, U. S. Route 1, and state routes 5, 9, 111, and 208. It is bordered by the city of Saco to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the towns of Dayton and Lyman to the west, and the towns of Kennebunkport and Arundel to the south. The Little River forms a portion of the border between Biddeford and the Goose Rocks neighborhood of Kennebunkport, in Biddeford&#x27;s most southerly region (Granite Point). East Point, located on the peninsula of Biddeford Pool, is the easternmost point in York County.

Timber Island, the most southerly point in the City of Biddeford, lies in Goosefare Bay at the mouth of the Little River, and is accessible at low tide from Goose Rocks Beach in Kennebunkport. The island and most of adjacent Timber Point became part of the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge in December 2011.

<text>Buxton is a town in York County, Maine, United States. It is part of the Portland metropolitan area. The population was 8,376 at the 2020 census. Buxton includes the villages of Salmon Falls/Tory Hill, Chicopee, Groveville, Bar Mills, West Buxton, and Buxton Center. The old town Common is east of Union Falls, which is the location of Skelton Dam, operated by Central Maine Power, and near historic location of the original settlement at Pleasant Point.

==History==
The township was granted by the Massachusetts General Court as Narragansett Number 1 in 1728. It was assigned to Philemon Dane of Ipswich, Massachusetts and 119 other veterans (or their heirs) who had fought in King Philip&#x27;s War against the Narragansett Indians in 1675. Settlement was attempted in the early 1740s but abandoned because of the ongoing French and Indian Wars.

The first permanent settlement commenced in fall of 1750 near Salmon Falls, which was within protection of the stockaded blockhouse and trading post built in 1728 a half mile below Union Falls in present-day Dayton. Amos Chase was one of the pioneers of the town, and his daughter was said to be the first white child born in Buxton. He was a prominent figure in the area, one of the largest taxpayers, and was the first deacon of the Congregational Church in Pepperellborough (present-day Saco, ME). The first schoolhouse in Buxton was established in 1761 by Rev. Silas Moody. Narragansett Number 1 was incorporated in 1772 as Buxton. It was named by its minister, Rev. Paul Coffin for the spa town of Buxton in Derbyshire, England, for unknown reasons. Buxton, England is often incorrectly cited as the home of his ancestors, but that was Brixton as noted on page 7 of the cited source(2).

Settlers found the land generally level and suited for farming. Chief crops were corn, potatoes and hay. Buxton also provided excellent water power sites. The first sawmill was on the Little River, a tributary of the Presumpscot River. A gristmill called Bog Mill was built at the outlet of Bonny Eagle Pond. The biggest mills, however, were located at the series of falls on the Saco River. Salmon Falls had sawmills capable of turning out four million feet of lumber annually. Bar Mills had gristmills and a box mill. Moderation Falls in West Buxton had sawmills, heading mills and woolen textile mills which produced about 936,000 yards of cloth annually. Buxton&#x27;s mill town prosperity left behind fine architecture. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places are Elden&#x27;s Store, the Buxton Powder House, the First Congregational Church, Royal Brewster House and Salmon Falls (East) Historic District.

<text>Cornish is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,508 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. The main village in town is the Cornish census-designated place. The village has a number of antique shops and restaurants near historic Thompson Park. Cornish is home to the first concrete bridge in North America.

==History==
In 1665, a trading post was established by Francis Small in the vicinity of Cornish village, not far from the confluence of the Ossipee River with the Saco River. Here converged three major Abenaki Indian paths—the Sokokis Trail (Route 5), the Ossipee Trail (Route 25) and the Pequawket Trail (Route 113), making it a central location for conducting with Native Americans the lucrative fur trade. In 1668, Small purchased from Newichawannock Chief Captain Sunday (or Wesumbe) the Ossipee Tract, encompassing the present-day towns of Cornish, Parsonsfield, Newfield, Limerick, Limington and Shapleigh (which then included Acton). The price was two large Indian blankets, two gallons of rum, two pounds of gunpowder, four pounds of musket balls and twenty strings of Indian beads. Small then sold a half interest in the tract to Major Nicholas Shapleigh of Eliot.

In 1770, heirs discovered the unrecorded deed, and hired attorney James Sullivan of Biddeford to pursue their claim. They won, and paid Sullivan for his services with the township he named Limerick. Small&#x27;s descendants took possession of Newfield, Limington and Cornish, the latter first named Francisborough, then Francistown, after its original proprietor. Settled by Joseph Thompson in 1782, it was incorporated on February 27, 1794, as Cornish, presumably by settlers from the county of Cornwall, England. The soil was very productive for farming, producing large crops of corn and other types of grain. In 1859, the population was 1,144. The Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad ran up the Saco River valley in the early 1870s, servicing Baldwin Station across the bridge from Cornish.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Cornish is drained by the Ossipee River and the Saco River. The town&#x27;s highest point is Clark Mountain, 1,320+ feet (402+ m) above sea level. It is also York County&#x27;s highest point. The second highest point in the town and county is Hosac Mountain, 1,320 feet (402 m), often mistaken as the highest point in York County.

The town is crossed by state routes 5, 25 and 160. Cornish borders the towns of Hiram to the north, Baldwin to the northeast, Limington to the east, Limerick to the south, and Parsonsfield to the west.

<text>Dayton is a town in York County, Maine, United States; the town is located near the Saco-Biddeford city area. Dayton borders Biddeford by land, and borders Saco on the Saco River. It is also part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. The population was 2,129 at the 2020 census. Dayton is one of the smallest towns in York County.

==History==

The area was once inhabited by the Sokokis (or Saco) Indians, who hunted and fished along the Saco River. The old Sokokis Trail is now Route 5, which passes through Dayton. In 1664, Major William Phillips purchased from the sagamore the land which would become Little Falls Plantation—today the towns of Hollis, Dayton and part of Limington. In 1728, a stockaded fort which contained a trading post was built a half mile below Union Falls. Called the Saco Truck House or Saco Block House, the garrison was maintained throughout the French and Indian War until the fall of Quebec in 1759.

Settlers arrived in 1753, and lumbering became a principal industry. Logs were rolled down the banks of the Saco River and floated to sawmills at Saco. Nathaniel Goodwin established the first local mill in 1782 at Goodwins Mills, where falls in Swan Brook drop . A sawmill and gristmill were erected at Union Falls (then called Hopkinson&#x27;s Mill) in 1806. Tanneries were built, and land was cleared for farms. In 1798, Little Falls Plantation was incorporated as Phillipsburg, in honor of Major William Phillips—but only until 1810. Considered difficult to pronounce and write, the Phillipsburg was changed to Hollis. Then, in 1854, the southern part of Hollis petitioned the state legislature to become a separate town. Permission was granted, and the community was named Dayton after Thomas Day, who submitted the petition.

In 1860, Dayton voted to build at Union Falls a covered bridge, long and wide, connecting to Buxton. The span was blown up in 1921 by the Clark Power Company, an event filmed as part of a melodrama by the Pine Tree Moving Picture Corporation of Portland. The Great Fires of 1947 destroyed two-thirds of Dayton, including 27 homes, four barns and the town hall. In 1951, the Central Maine Power Company built a hydroelectric dam, Skelton Dam, between Salmon Falls and Union Falls, submerging the scenic gorge. With the submergence of the gorge, the road that ran perpendicular to the covered bridge was cut off. A new road called Company Road was built to replace it. Once a community of dairy farms, Dayton is now primarily residential.

<doc id="116272" wikidata="Q2533865" url="?curid=116272" title="Eliot, Maine">
<text>Eliot is a town in York County, Maine, United States. Originally settled in 1623, it was formerly a part of Kittery, to its east. After Kittery, it is the next most southern town in the state of Maine, lying on the Piscataqua River across from Portsmouth and Newington, New Hampshire. The population was 6,717 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

Eliot is home to Ambush Rock, Green Acre, and the Raitt Homestead Farm Museum.

==History==
===Founding===
Today&#x27;s town of Eliot was formerly the Middle Parish of the town Kittery, Maine, originally part of the royal grant to Sir Ferdinando Gorges known as the Piscataqua Plantation. Kittery was incorporated in 1647, today distinguishing itself as &quot;the oldest incorporated town in Maine.&quot;

While this may be so, settlements upriver on the north side of the Piscataqua River in today&#x27;s Eliot were established considerably earlier, owing to more favorable conditions for harborage, timber, and shipbuilding. This is the basis for Eliot maintaining it was &quot;settled&quot; almost a quarter century earlier in 1623.

In 1659 the local court decreed that there should be two meeting houses in Kittery. The town&#x27;s inhabitants disagreed, and held a town meeting on July 17, 1660, where it was:
...Agreed and fully consented unto that this town of Kittery is by free consent divided into three parts for settling of three ministers, one in the east part as followeth, one at Nichewancick [today&#x27;s Berwick] which bound ae to come doown unto Thompson point brook formerly called the black Brook and from that Brook the second division is to go downward to the great cove below Thos. Spinney&#x27;s Point and the third division to go down from the great cove unto Brave Boat Harbor with Capt. Champernown Island, all of which three divisions according as they are divided each division to bear their own charges for the maintenance of their own minister.

The Upper Parish, then known as the Parish of Unity, later became the town of Berwick (incorporated in 1713), with the uppermost part of Kittery along the Piscataqua becoming the Upper Parish. Left without a meeting house or minister, the residents of a newly created Middle Parish between the Upper and Lower along the river between it and Spinney&#x27;s Cove [Great Cove] were permitted by order of the court to attend church across the Piscataqua in either the towns of Dover, New Hampshire or Portsmouth for one-half their going rates.

Prior to Eliot&#x27;s incorporation as a town on March 1, 1810, the Upper Parish had been in conflict with Kittery&#x27;s other parishes since at least 1791. In 1791, the parish&#x27;s minister died. His successor, according to a large faction of the parish&#x27;s inhabitants, was a man of &quot;unfair character&quot; imposed by &quot;a small party&quot; of people. He was rejected by &quot;a large majority&quot;, and a new minister was installed in 1792. The internal strife between inhabitants didn&#x27;t stop there.

The minority faction, angered by the removal of their minister, petitioned the Legislature in 1796 to be set off to the Upper Parish, which was accordingly done. The inhabitants of the second Parish, which was left without a meetinghouse and left to worship across the river at half rate in the town of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, accused the members of the other two of conspiring against them.

The town was likely named for Reverend John Eliot of Boston, a friend of General Andrew P. Fernald, the town agent largely responsible for its separation.

===Scotland Bridge===
A section of northern Eliot bordering on York came to be known as &quot;Scotland Bridge&quot; after Scots prisoners of war from the English Civil War Battle of Dunbar were resettled there in 1650. These Scots had been force-marched to Durham Cathedral in Durham, England, then tried for treason for supporting Charles II rather than Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector. The name remains today.

==Geography==

<text>Hollis is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 4,745 at the 2020 census. Hollis is a rural bedroom community of Portland and is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

The town of Hollis was originally called Little Falls Plantation, which also encompassed all of the town of Dayton and a small part of Limington, namely the area south of the Little Ossipee River. It was bought in 1664 by Major William Phillips from Hobinowell and Mogg Hegon, sagamores of the local Abenaki Indians. In 1728, the Massachusetts General Court ordered that a combination trading post and stockaded blockhouse be constructed on the Saco River to conduct trade with the Native Americans. It was made crudely of logs and equipped with a cannon. Ten men and a sergeant garrisoned it.

John and Andrew Gordon tried to settle the land in 1754, but were driven away by the Native Americans. On March 27, 1781, the first recorded plantation meeting took place and Joseph Chadbourne was elected moderator. By 1790 the population had grown to 607. The first vote for state office came in 1791, when Little Falls gave John Hancock 27 votes. In 1798, Little Falls was incorporated into Phillipsburg, named in honor of Major Phillips. The first town meeting took place on September 27, 1798, at the home of Stephen Hopkinson. The moderator was Joseph Chadbourne. In 1810 a committee was put together to rename the town, headed by Colonel Isaac Lane and Captain Eben Cleaves. It was finally decided upon the name Hollis. The reasoning behind the name is not known; it is thought to have been inspired by Hollis, New Hampshire, or possibly by the Duke of Newcastle, whose family name was Holles.

Farmers grew corn, potatoes and hay in the sandy loam. Water powered mills were built along the Saco River at Hollis village, Bar Mills, Moderation Falls (opposite West Buxton), North Hollis and Bonny Eagle Falls. These included lumber mills, a spool factory, a woodturning mill, a wooden box factory and the Saco River Woolen Company. The Portland and Rochester Railroad crossed the southern part of the town.

Hollis was the closest community to the epicenter of a 4.0 magnitude earthquake felt by many across New England on October 16, 2012.

<text>Kittery Point is a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Kittery, York County, Maine, United States. First settled in 1623, Kittery Point traces its history to the first seafarers who colonized the shore of what became Massachusetts Bay Colony and later the State of Maine. Located beside the Atlantic Ocean, it is home to Fort McClary State Historic Site, and Fort Foster Park on Gerrish Island. Cutts Island is home to Seapoint Beach and the Brave Boat Harbor Division of the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge.

Kittery Point is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,012 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Settled as early as 1623, the southern part of Kittery was once called Champernowne&#x27;s after Sir Francis Champernowne, a prominent merchant adventurer and cousin of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the prime mover behind settlement north of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Nicholas Shapleigh built the first house in the area, and Edward Godfrey established a trading post in 1632. Early professions included fishermen, hunters and trappers. Others harvested the region&#x27;s abundant timber, which was shipped to England or the West Indies. The town of Kittery was incorporated in 1652 when Maine became part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

The Pepperrells were a distinguished Kittery Point family who established fisheries to supply the London market. William Pepperrell Sr. had arrived from Devonshire as a lowly fisherman&#x27;s apprentice at the Isles of Shoals in New Hampshire. He went on to build a mercantile empire, which his son Sir William Pepperrell inherited and expanded. Sir William became the first baronet in New England for commanding a militia which defeated the French in 1745 at the Siege of Louisbourg. His gambrel mansion of 1733 remains a landmark at Pepperrell Cove on the Piscataqua River. In 1760, his widow built the Lady Pepperrell House, a noted Georgian building formerly owned by Historic New England.

Pepperrell himself built an elaborate wooden house called the Sparhawk Mansion at Kittery Point as a gift to his daughter on her marriage to Nathaniel Sparhawk in 1750. Crowned with an elegant cupola, the house contained finely carved panelling in its 19 rooms. Sadly, over two centuries later, in 1967 the Sparhawk Mansion was demolished, just as preservation efforts in the area were emerging. More fortunate is the John Bray House, built by a shipwright in 1662 and considered the oldest surviving house in Maine. Recently threatened with redevelopment because of its desirable view of Pepperrell Cove and Portsmouth Harbor, the building has instead been restored. Some speculate that the Bray House was the birthplace of the mother of Sir William Pepperrell, whose father William Pepperrell Sr. married John Bray&#x27;s daughter Margery, but it is more likely that she was born in England.

On land once owned by Sir William Pepperrell is a Portsmouth Harbor defense called Fort McClary, built opposite Fort Constitution in New Castle, New Hampshire. It is today Fort McClary State Historic Site and features a blockhouse dating from 1844. In 1969, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Fort Foster, a later coastal defense, was built by the federal government on at Gerrish Island. Now owned by the town of Kittery, Fort Foster Park provides superb views of Portsmouth Harbor, Whaleback Lighthouse and the Isles of Shoals, part of which belongs to Kittery. Near Seapoint Beach in the mid-20th century, the Newcomen Society built a cluster of Tudor cottages at what was then its summer retreat.

<text>Lebanon is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 6,469 at the 2020 census. Lebanon includes the villages of Center Lebanon, West Lebanon, North Lebanon, South Lebanon, and East Lebanon. It is the westernmost town in Maine. Lebanon is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

It was called Towwoh by the Newichawannock Abenaki tribe, whose main village was further down the Salmon Falls River. On April 20, 1733, the Massachusetts General Court granted Towwoh Plantation to 60 colonists, who first settled it in 1743. The township was incorporated on June 17, 1767, renamed Lebanon after the biblical land of Lebanon. It was Maine&#x27;s 23rd town. Lebanon annexed unincorporated land in 1785, and some from Sanford in 1787. It swapped land with Shapleigh, giving some in 1793, then annexing some in 1825.

Farmers found the surface of the town relatively level in the southeast, with extensive pine plains in the northwest. The chief crop would be hay. At the Salmon Falls River and the Little River were water power sites for mills. Lebanon had four sawmills, three gristmills, a shingle mill, a wool carding mill and a tannery. In 1850, Oren B. Cheney founded West Lebanon Academy. Beginning in the early 1870s, the Portland and Rochester Railroad ran the length of the town&#x27;s southeast side, with the Portsmouth, Great Falls and Conway Railroad crossing for a short distance on the western side.

==Geography==

<text>Limerick (pronounced &quot;LIM-rick&quot;) is a town in York County, Maine, United States. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. The population was 3,188 at the 2020 census.

==History==

This was territory of the Newichewannock Abenaki Indians, whose village was located on the Salmon Falls River. In 1668, Francis Small of Kittery, a trader, bought from Chief Captain Sunday (or Wesumbe) a large tract of land, for which he exchanged two blankets, two gallons of rum, two pounds of gunpowder, four pounds of musket balls and twenty strings of beads. Small thereupon sold half of his interest to Major Nicholas Shapleigh of Eliot, one of the wealthiest merchants in the Piscataqua region.

Settlement was delayed, however, by the ongoing French and Indian Wars, which finally ended with the 1763 Treaty of Paris. In 1773, the heirs of Francis Small and Nicholas Shapleigh promised a township to lawyer James Sullivan of Biddeford if he defended their larger claims. Sullivan accepted and in 1775 helped settle Limerick Plantation, named after Limerick in Ireland, his father&#x27;s birthplace. It would be incorporated on March 6, 1787. Among the early settlers was Dr. Joshua Leavitt, for whom Leavitt Brook in Limerick is named. The town of New Limerick in Aroostook County would be settled by people from Limerick, Maine.

The village grew along the old Sokokis Trail (now Route 5), which connected the Sokokis village at Pequawket (now Fryeburg) to the tribe&#x27;s coastal encampment at what is today Saco. Endowed with good soil, Limerick became a thriving farming community. Chief crops included hay, apples, grapes and cranberries. Cattle and dairy products were important. In addition, the town had four blacksmith shops, four shoemakers, two hatmakers, two makers and three tanneries. Various brooks provided water power for industry, including four furniture factories and a clothing factory. There were also gristmills, shingle mills and lumber mills. In 1826 the Morning Star, a Free Will Baptist abolitionist newspaper, was founded in the town. In 1846, James Bradbury established the Limerick Manufacturing Company at Brown Brook. It was bought in 1857 by Joshua Holland. The firm produced the nationally famous Holland Blankets, which were supplied to troops during the Civil War. A village once called Hollandville developed around the mill.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Set among hills and lakes, Limerick is drained by Leavitt Brook, Brown Brook and Spencer Brook.

The town borders Newfield, Parsonsfield, Cornish, Waterboro and Limington. Maine State routes 5, 11, and 160 cross through Limerick.

<text>Limington is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 3,892 at the 2020 census. Limington is a tourist destination with historic architecture. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

In 1668, Francis Small traded goods with the Newichewannock tribe of this area. Their Chief Wesumbe, also known as Captain Sunday, was friendly with Small and warned him of a plot against his life. A group of renegade tribesmen planned to murder Small rather than pay him the furs they owed him. Small escaped after watching his trading post in what is now Cornish burn to the ground. The chief made up for the loss by selling Small all the lands bounded by the Great and Little Ossipee Rivers, the Saco River and the New Hampshire border. Known as the Ossipee Tract, it comprised the present-day towns of Limington, Limerick, Cornish (formerly Francisborough), Newfield, Parsonsfield and Shapleigh (which then included Acton).

First called Little Ossipee Plantation (after Ossapee, its original Abenaki name), it was settled by Deacon Amos Chase, who removed here and built a mill in 1773 at the mouth of the Little Ossipee River. Ezra Davis and Jonathan Boothby followed him in 1774, and John McArthur and Joshua Small in 1775. Little Ossipee Plantation was incorporated on February 9, 1792, as the town of Limington. It was named after Limington in Somerset, England, the home county of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Lord Proprietor of Maine. As the surface of the land was rocky and broken, in 1798 nearly of land were annexed from Little Falls Plantation (Hollis). In 1870, about of land were ceded to Limerick.

Soil was fertile and farmers yielded good crops. Another important early trade was logging, with the timber manufactured at various water power mills into lumber, boxes, shingles and clapboards. There were also gristmills and a tannery. Limington Academy was incorporated in 1848, its structure built in 1852. The population in 1870 was 1,630. Davis Memorial Library was built in 1912 to designs of noted Portland architect John Calvin Stevens. Today, 22 buildings in the town center are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Limington is drained by the Little Ossipee River and Saco River. There are seven ponds, with four of these—Boyd, Dole, Foss and Sand ponds—in South Limington, and three others—Horn, Ward and Webster ponds—in North Limington. The highest point in town is Sawyer Mountain, at an elevation of above sea level.

Limington is served by state routes 11, 25 and 117. It borders the towns of Baldwin to the north, Standish to the east, Hollis and Waterboro to the south, and Limerick and Cornish to the west. Located in the extreme northeastern part of York County, Limington is slightly over nine miles (14 km) long and an average of five miles (8 km) wide.

<text>Lyman is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 4,525 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. Lyman, together with Alfred, is home to Massabesic Experimental Forest.

==History==
In 1660, John Sanders, John Bush and Peter Turbat purchased from the Abenaki sachem Sosowen and his son Fluellin what is now the township of Lyman. First called Swanfield, it was settled in 1767. While the original settlers are not known for certain, early records and deeds mention the following: William and Jacob Waterhouse (of Kennebunk), Love Roberts, Alexander Grant, Thomas Lord, Jacob Rhoades, Benjamin and Mark Goodwin (brothers who built one of the first mills at Goodwin&#x27;s Mills), John Low (who served as town moderator and treasurer), John Burbank, Joseph Witten, James and William Brock, Mark Ricker, Robert Cousens, Valentine Hill, and Gershom Downs.

Swanfield would be incorporated by the Massachusetts General Court on April 24, 1780, as Coxhall, probably after Coggeshall (pronounced Coxhall) in Essex, England. On February 25, 1803, the name was changed to Lyman in honor of Theodore Lyman, a wealthy merchant who established a successful shipping firm in the 1790s at York before moving to Boston.

Farmers found the surface of the town moderately uneven, with fair soil that yielded good crops of grain, hay and apples. Watermills were established at the outlets of the larger ponds, with two sawmills at Swan Pond and another at Kennebunk Pond. Lumbering was a considerable source of income for many inhabitants. In 1782, a sawmill and gristmill were erected at Goodwin&#x27;s Mills, which developed into the town&#x27;s only business and trade center, despite the fact that some of the village is actually located in Dayton. The Great Fires of 1947 devastated part of Lyman. Today, the town is largely a bedroom community.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Lyman is drained by the Kennebunk River.

The town is crossed by U.S. Route 202 and State Routes 5, 35 and 111. It is bordered by the towns of Hollis and Dayton to the northeast, Arundel and Kennebunk to the southeast, Alfred to the southwest, and Waterboro to the northwest.

<text>Newfield is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,648 at the 2020 census. The town is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford metropolitan statistical area.

Newfield was home to a museum called Willowbrook Museum Village.

==History==
This was part of the large tract sold on November 28, 1668, by Newichawannock Indian Chief Sunday (or Wesumbe) to Francis Small, a Kittery trader. The price was two large Indian blankets, two gallons of rum, two pounds of gunpowder, four pounds of musket balls and twenty strings of beads. The township was surveyed and first settled as Washington Plantation in 1778. A number of settlers had been soldiers in the Revolutionary War. It was incorporated as Newfield on February 25, 1794, and by 1859, the population was 1,418.

The Little Ossipee River runs through Newfield village and once provided water power to operate two gristmills, two lumber mills, a barrel stave mill, a shook mill, a planing mill and a carding mill. West Newfield had a sawmill, gristmill and stave mill. There was an attempt in the community to mine silver and iron, but it was not profitable. By 1880, the population was 995. Newfield would be heavily damaged by the Great Fires of 1947.

Don King of Topsfield, Massachusetts bought an old farm at Newfield in 1965, marking the beginning of what would become Willowbrook Museum Village, a re-created 19th-century village. Other properties and historic buildings were added, together with a collection of early farm implements, tools, carriages and sleighs. The museum is now a tourist attraction.

On March 17, 2009, Newfield adopted a local law to stop Nestlé and other corporations from taking over their groundwater. The volunteer community organization, Protecting Our Water and Wildlife Resources (POWWR), with the assistance of Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) who drafted the ordinance, were responsible for advocating the legislation.

==Geography==

<text>Ogunquit ( ) is a resort town in York County, Maine, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 1,577. 

Ogunquit is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

Ogunquit was first a village within Wells, which was settled in 1641. The first sawmill was established in 1686, and shipbuilding developed along the tidal Ogunquit River. Local shipwrights built schooners, brigs and dories.

At what was then called Fish Cove, near the unnavigable Josias River, fishing was a major livelihood. But the cove was unprotected by a headland or breakwater from Atlantic storms, so fishermen had to protect their boats by hauling them ashore each night. Resolving to create a safe anchorage, they formed the Fish Cove Harbor Association, and dug a channel across land they purchased to connect Fish Cove with the Josias River. When the trench was complete, erosion helped to further widen the passage. The resulting tidewater basin is called Perkins Cove, spanned by a manually operated draw footbridge. With a one and a half-mile beach of pale sand and dunes forming a barrier peninsula, connected to the mainland in 1888 by bridge across the Ogunquit River, the village was discovered by artists. It became a popular art colony and tourist area. Particularly after 1898, when the Ogunquit Art Colony was established, it was not unusual to see both artists and fishermen working around Perkins Cove. To accommodate summer crowds, several seaside hotels and inns were built. Marginal Way, a scenic trail dating back to the 1920s, runs along the coast from Perkins Cove to Ogunquit Beach.

<text>Parsonsfield is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,791 at the 2020 census. Parsonsfield includes the villages of Kezar Falls, Parsonsfield, and North, East and South Parsonsfield. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

This was part of a large tract of land sold on November 28, 1668, by Newichewannock Indian Chief Sunday (or Wesumbe) to Francis Small, a trader from Kittery. The price was two large Indian blankets, two gallons of rum, two pounds of gunpowder, four pounds of musket balls and twenty strings of Indian beads. Small then sold half his interest to Major Nicholas Shapleigh of what is now Eliot. In 1771, heirs sold the township to Thomas Parsons and 39 associates, upon which it was surveyed into lots. Called Parsonstown Plantation, it was first settled in 1772 by 12 families.

On August 29, 1785, the town was incorporated as Parsonsfield after Thomas Parsons, one of the largest proprietors. The Blazo-Leavitt House, a fine example of the Federal style, was built in 1812. Parsonsfield Seminary was founded in 1832 and closed in 1949.

The surface of the town is rough and hilly, its soil rocky but fertile for farming. Chief crops were grain and hay. Mills were built at pond outlets and on the South River. The largest water power source was on the Ossipee River at Kezar Falls, where the village of Kezar Falls straddled the stream into Porter. Parsonsfield had seven sawmills and seven gristmills. In 1880, John Devereux and George W. Towle built the Kezar Falls Woolen Mill, a woolen textile factory which became the most important business in Parsonsfield.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Parsonsfield is drained by the South River and Ossipee River. The town&#x27;s highest point is Wiggin Mountain, above sea level.

The town is crossed by state routes 25, 160, and NH 153. It is bordered by Effingham and Wakefield, New Hampshire to the west, Porter and Hiram to the north, Cornish and Limerick to the east, and Newfield to the south.

==Geographical description in 1888==

Note: &quot;The following section is largely copied from the book &quot;History of Parsonsfield, Maine: 1771–1888,&quot; published by Brown Thurston &amp; Company, 1888.&quot;

The town of Parsonsfield is in the extreme northwest corner of York County, Maine. Center Square, on the northern slope of Cedar Mountain, is about from the ocean, at Old Orchard and thirty-two from Wells Beach on an air line, and west-north-west from Portland.

Its northern boundary is the Great Ossipee River (Ossipee signifies &quot;River of Pines&quot; in the Indian dialect.) The towns of Porter and Hiram are north of the river. Effingham and Wakefield, NH, are on the western border, Newfield is on the south, Limerick and Cornish on the east. The outer lines of the town have been measured several times, giving an area from 62.23 to 64 square miles (161 to 166 km2). The length of the western line is nearly 8., the eastern something over , the northern and southern about 7..

The surface of Parsonsfield is quite broken, or more properly, rises into high swells. Ricker&#x27;s Mountain, in the southwest, is the highest, it being not far from above the level of the sea. Cedar Mountain, in the center, comes up within one hundred feet of Ricker&#x27;s, while Randall&#x27;s Mountain in the east, may fall below Cedar. The Seminary varies but little from above sea level, while the average altitude of the town is estimated at . After Parsonsfield Seminary burned in 1854, Bates College was founded as a replacement.

Ricker&#x27;s Mountain takes its name from Dea. Dominicus Ricker, who lived and died near the summit. Cedar is so called from the mountain cedar growing there. A legend tells how a hunter named Randall perished from cold on the mountain called by his name. Another tradition goes something like this: &quot;Many years ago a famous hunter, named Randall, hunted hereaway among these mountains and caught much game. He usually reposed on the top of the high mountain by the rivulet, where it is supposed he was murdered by another hunter for his furs. The supposed murderer was absent only a few days from the settlements and returned heavily laden with valuable skins.&quot;

The high ridge, of which Cedar Mountain is the apex, runs east and west across the town. It is the water-shed, or divide, between the Great and Little Ossipee Rivers. The town is dotted all over with hills and swells, some of them hard to climb, but generally productive.

The principal river is the Great Ossipee. By estimation, the average yearly discharge is nine billion cubic feet (8 m³/s), the length , draining an area of about . There is an excellent water power at Kezar Falls, the descent being .

South River is next in size. It enters the Ossipee above Porter Bridge. The privilege at Lord&#x27;s mills is the best within the town. The Bickford and Blaisdall mill streams run into the Little Ossipee. Smaller brooks are found in all parts of the town. It would be hard to find a lot of land not having one or more living springs, and as many never failing rivulets.

A small part of Province Pond is in Parsonsfield. The state line is one-fourth of a mile (400 m) from the eastern shore, and the distance across, by that line, is about . Long Pond, in the northeast, is a beautiful sheet of water, long, and about one-third (800 m) that in width. West Pond, separated from Long Pond by a ridge, is nearly half as large. Smaller ponds are found among the hills.

Coarse granite rock projects here and there, but surface ledges cover only a small part of the town. Less than half the wells extend down to the rock bed. The prevailing soil may be denominated granite. There are patches of sand, but clay, even of inferior quality, is scarce. From one to two feet (300 to 600 mm) below the surface there is a hard pan or subsoil.

There are but few swamps or bog meadows, for the reason that the surface is tilted this, that, and every way, but valuable intervales lie along the brooks and rivers.

There are very few farms without stones enough to fence them. A large surplus of this imperishable fence material is the rule.

The original forest growth was maple, beech, hemlock, pine, birch, oak, and ash, with scores of other trees interspersed. Each variety prevailing in its favored locality, but not holding exclusive possession of a single farm. Where a second growth has been allowed to spring up, the soft woods in many cases have succeeded the hard, while the hard has been followed by soft. It is known that the present growth is a little more mixed than the first.

Roughly 20 percent of the town of Parsonsfield falls within the Leavitt Plantation Forest, the largest contiguous block of forest land south of Sebago Lake. When the tract of forest was slated to be sold into smaller parcels, the Nature Conservancy and the state of Maine intervened, purchasing a conservation easement on the entire parcel and keeping it intact. That easement will protect Leavitt Plantation in perpetuity, while allowing sustainable forestry practices.

<text>Saco ( ) is a city in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 20,381 at the 2020 census. It is home to Ferry Beach State Park, Funtown Splashtown USA, Thornton Academy, as well as Saco Valley Shopping Center. General Dynamics Armament Systems (also known by its former name, Saco Defense), a subsidiary of the defense contractor General Dynamics. Saco sees much tourism during summer months due to its amusement parks, Camp Ellis Beach and Pier, Ferry Beach State Park, and proximity to Old Orchard Beach.

Saco is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. Saco&#x27;s twin-city is Biddeford.

==History==

This was territory of the Abenaki tribe whose fortified village was located up the Sokokis Trail at Pequawket (now Fryeburg). There was a settlement at the mouth of the Saco river, with homes and permanent cultivation, at the time of contact with Europeans in the early 1600s.

In July 1607, 500 warriors led by &quot;sakmow&quot; (Grand Chief) of the Mi&#x27;kmaq First Nations Henri Membertou attacked the village at present-day Saco, killing 20 of their braves, including two of their leaders, Onmechin and Marchin, leading to conflict that lasted until 1615.

In 1630 the Plymouth Company granted Thomas Lewis and Richard Bonython a charter to establish a town at Saco, with a deed that extended along the sea, by inland. Settled in 1631 as part of Winter Harbor (as Biddeford Pool was first known). The government of Maine, under Ferdinando Gorges, was based in the town from 1636 to 1653. It would be reorganized in 1653 by the Massachusetts General Court as Saco, which would be renamed Biddeford in 1718.

The settlement was attacked by Indians in 1675 during King Philip&#x27;s War. Settlers moved to the mouth of the river, and the houses and mills they left behind were burned. Saco lay in contested territory between New England and New France, which recruited the Indians as allies. In 1689 during King William&#x27;s War, it was again attacked, with some residents taken captive. Hostilities intensified from 1702 until 1709, then ceased in 1713 with the Treaty of Portsmouth. The community was rebuilt and in 1718 incorporated as Biddeford. Peace would not last, however, and the town was again attacked in 1723 during Dummer&#x27;s War, when it contained 14 garrisons. In August and September 1723, there were Indian raids on Saco, Maine and Dover, New Hampshire. But in 1724, a Massachusetts militia destroyed Norridgewock, an Abenaki stronghold on the Kennebec River organizing raids on English settlements. The region became less dangerous, especially after the French defeat in 1745 at the Battle of Louisburg. The French and Indian Wars finally ended with the 1763 Treaty of Paris.

In 1762, the northeastern bank of Biddeford separated as the District of Pepperrellborough, named for Sir William Pepperrell, hero of the Battle of Louisburg and late proprietor of the town. Amos Chase was one of the pioneers of Pepperrellborough. He was chosen as a selectman at the first town meeting, and served as the first deacon of the Congregational Church. Dea. Chase was one of the area&#x27;s largest taxpayers, and was prominent in civic affairs during the American Revolution, serving on the town&#x27;s Committee of Correspondence and Committee of Inspection.

The district was incorporated as the Town of Pepperellborough in 1775. Inhabitants found the name to be cumbersome, so in 1805 it was renamed Saco. It would be incorporated as a city in 1867. Saco became a center for lumbering, with log drives down the river from Little Falls Plantation (now Dayton, Lyman, Hollis and part of Limington). At Saco Falls, the timber was cut by 17 sawmills. In 1827, the community produced of sawn lumber, some of which was used for shipbuilding.

On Factory Island, the Saco Iron Works began operation in 1811. The Saco Manufacturing Company established a cotton mill in 1826, and a canal was dug through rock to provide water power. The mill burned in 1830, but was replaced in 1831 by the York Manufacturing Company. With the arrival of the Portland, Saco and Portsmouth Railroad in 1842, Factory Island developed into a major textile manufacturing center, with extensive brick mills dominating the Saco and Biddeford waterfronts. Other businesses included foundries, belting and harnessmaking, and machine shops. But the New England textile industry faded in the 20th century, and the York Manufacturing Company would close in 1958. The prosperous mill town era, however, left behind much fine architecture in the Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival and Victorian styles. Many buildings are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1844, Laurel Hill Cemetery was established on of land. Still in operation, it is one of the earliest examples of the Rural cemetery movement.

Saco has taken steps to make the city more environmentally friendly. In early 2007 a small wind turbine was erected near the water treatment plant at the foot of Front street. Another larger wind turbine was erected on the top of York Hill in December 2007, and was expected to generate power for the new train station for Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Downeaster&quot;, although this was torn down in 2018 as the wind turbine never came close to generating the amount of energy promised. Saco also has two growing business parks.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Situated beside Saco Bay on the Gulf of Maine, Saco is drained by the Saco River.

Saco borders the city of Biddeford, as well as the towns of Scarborough, Buxton, Dayton and Old Orchard Beach.

===Terrain===
Saco contains a wide variety of landforms, including beaches, fields, forests, bogs, and urban areas. The beachfront Camp Ellis section of the city has been eroding since the Army Corps of Engineers built a jetty in the 1860s at the mouth of the Saco River that stopped sediment from feeding the Camp Ellis beaches. This has been exacerbated by rising sea levels and climate change in Maine. 

This is an archive of documents related to erosion issues in the Camp Ellis section of Saco.

<text>Shapleigh, pronounced &quot;SHAP-lee&quot;, is a town in York County, Maine, United States which was incorporated as the state&#x27;s 43rd town in 1785. The population was 2,921 at the 2020 census. Shapleigh is divided into the villages of North Shapleigh, Shapleigh Corner, Ross Corner and Emery Mills. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

In 1668, Chief Captain Sunday (or Wesumbe) of the Newichawannock Abenaki tribe deeded Francis Small the Ossipee Tract, which included Cornish, Parsonsfield, Newfield, Limerick, Limington and Shapleigh. Small, a trader from Kittery, then sold a half interest to Major Nicholas Shapleigh of Eliot. In 1770, heirs discovered the unrecorded deed and made claim. Shapleigh&#x27;s heirs took Parsonsfield, Shapleigh and one half of Limerick.

First called Hubbardstown, it was settled in 1772 when Simeon Emery erected a sawmill at the foot of Mousam Pond. On March 5, 1785, the town was incorporated as Shapleigh, named for its early proprietor. In 1830, Shapleigh&#x27;s west half was set off and incorporated as Acton. In 1846, a portion of Shapleigh was annexed by Newfield. Shapleigh annexed an eastern portion of land from Waterboro in 1854.

There were sawmills in Emery Mills, Shapleigh Corner and North Shapleigh, which also had a woolen textile factory (known as Hargraves Woolen Mill) and leather board factory. For a few years beginning in 1837, iron was produced at a blast furnace in North Shapleigh from bog iron retrieved from Little Ossipee Pond. Foundations, walls, and slag remained at the site at the time of a 2003 Maine Geological Survey publication on the site. Shapleigh was one of the Maine towns devastated by the Great Fires of 1947.

In 2009, Shapleigh residents (along with those of Newfield) successfully opposed the industrial-scale drawing of water from its aquifer by Nestlé, operating under the Poland Spring brand.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Shapleigh is drained by the Little Ossipee River and Mousam River. All of Shapleigh&#x27;s woodlands are protected by The Nature Conservancy.

The town has three mountains over : Fort Ridge, Abbott Mountain and an unnamed mountain () located a half mile northwest of Abbott Mountain. Fort Ridge, with its highest summit at above sea level, is the town&#x27;s highest mountain. Abbott Mountain, which is often mistaken to be the highest point in town, rises to an elevation of , making it the town&#x27;s second highest point. Due to its local popularity as a hiking destination, high traffic from all terrain vehicles (ATV) and the resulting erosion from overuse, the actual elevation of Abbott Mountain&#x27;s ground-down summit is estimated to be closer to 1,060 feet in elevation.

The town is served by state routes 11 and 109. It borders Acton to the west, Waterboro to the east, Alfred to the southeast, Newfield to the north, and Sanford to the south.

<text>South Berwick is a town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 7,467 at the 2020 census. South Berwick is home to Berwick Academy, a private, co-educational university-preparatory day school founded in 1791.

The town was set off from Berwick in 1814, followed by North Berwick in 1831. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. The primary village in the town is the South Berwick census-designated place.

==History==

The area was called Newichawannock by the Abenaki Indians, meaning &quot;river with many falls,&quot; a reference to the Salmon Falls River. It was first settled by Europeans about 1631 as a part of Kittery known as Kittery North Parish. Near the confluence with the Great Works River, Ambrose Gibbons built the Great House at Newichawannock, a palisaded trading post, to exchange goods with the Indians.

In 1634, William Chadbourne, James Wall, and John Goddard arrived from England aboard the ship &quot;Pied Cow&quot; to build a sawmill and gristmill at Assabumbadoc Falls. The first houses built in South Berwick were built by Chadbourne and Wall. Chadbourne&#x27;s house was in the northwesterly angle of Brattle Street and Dow Highway (Rt. 236). Richard Leader, an engineer, rebuilt the sawmill in 1651 to handle up to 20 saws. The factory became known as the &quot;Great mill workes,&quot; from which the Great Works River derives its name. It was run by 25 Scottish prisoners of war captured by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s forces at the 1650 Battle of Dunbar and transported aboard the &quot;Unity&quot; to North America. They were sold as indentured servants whose labor would earn them freedom. The community was dubbed the Parish of Unity after the ship.

The village was attacked in 1675 during King Philip&#x27;s War, then raided again in 1690–1691 during King William&#x27;s War by Indians under the command of officers from New France, who burned the Parish of Unity to the ground. It was abandoned, but resettled in 1703 under its Abenaki name, Newichawannock. The Massachusetts General Court incorporated it in 1713 as Berwick, the 9th oldest town in Maine. It was named after Berwick-upon-Tweed, a town of mixed allegiances on the Anglo-Scottish border. What evolved into today&#x27;s Berwick Academy opened in 1791. On February 12, 1814, South Berwick was set off and incorporated.

During the 19th century, various mills were erected at the rivers to use their water power. At the head of navigation, Quampheagan Falls on the Salmon Falls River became the site of the Portsmouth Manufacturing Company. Established in 1831, the cotton textile mill had 7000 spindles and 216 looms, which by 1868 produced 2 million yards of sheeting per year. The mill closed in 1893, and most of its brick buildings were razed about 1917, but the Greek Revival counting house is now the Old Berwick Historical Society Museum. South Berwick also made woolens, shoes, plows, and cultivators, as well as sawn and planed lumber. The town was noted for its apple orchards. Some inhabitants worked across the bridge in Rollinsford, New Hampshire at the Salmon Falls Manufacturing Company, which closed in 1927. The village center was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

In 1901, local author Sarah Orne Jewett set her historical romance &quot;The Tory Lover&quot; at the Hamilton House in South Berwick. Built about 1785, the Federal style mansion is now a museum operated by Historic New England, which also owns the Sarah Orne Jewett House, built in 1774 overlooking Central Square.

Welch Hill, elevation 370 feet (112.8 m) above sea level, is the town&#x27;s highest point. The lowest elevation, which is sea level, is located along the Salmon Falls River, from the small hydroelectric dam next to the New Hampshire Route 4 bridge, south to the town&#x27;s border with Eliot.

==History==
Abenaki Indians called the area Massabesic, meaning &quot;the place of much water&quot;, a reference to the region&#x27;s lakes. It was part of an extensive tract of land purchased in 1661 by Major William Phillips of Saco from Chief Fluellin. Known as Massabesic Plantation, it included most of modern-day Waterboro, Alfred and Sanford. Phillips died in 1683, and the plantation eventually passed from his heirs to 10 proprietors. One of those proprietors was Colonel Joshua Waters, for whom the town would be named.

Lumbering began to thrive there about 1764. Captain John Smith from Kittery was the first permanent settler, arriving in 1768. On March 6, 1787, the Massachusetts General Court incorporated the township as Waterborough. In 1790, Old Corners became the site of the Court of General Sessions, although in 1805 the county seat shifted to Alfred. In 1895, the name was shortened to Waterboro.

With land particularly suited for livestock grazing, agriculture became a principal industry. The town had many cattle and dairy farms. The Portland and Rochester Railroad passed through Waterboro and connected to Rochester, New Hampshire in 1871, helping spur development. Rivers and brooks provided water power to operate mills. Several sawmills were established, and by 1886, the town produced about of lumber annually. Other businesses included the Ossipee Manufacturing Company at the Little Ossipee River, which made blankets, and the Steam Mill Company at South Waterboro, which made wooden boxes. In 1922, the Goodall-Sanford Mills built in Waterboro village a spinning mill, taken over by a patent leather manufacturer that operated from 1939 to 1982.

Fire twice devastated the town. In 1911, a large portion of South Waterboro burned. Then during the Great Fires of 1947, three-quarters of Waterboro&#x27;s land area burned, including the town center and 90% of the cottages on Little Ossipee Lake. Today, Waterboro&#x27;s lakes remain a popular recreation area. The town is home to the Waterboro Barrens, one of the largest and best preserved pitch pine barrens in Maine.

On October 16, 2012, an M4.0 earthquake shook the city and the rest of Maine. It also shook New Hampshire, Massachusetts and most of the New England states.

<text>Wells is a resort town in York County, Maine, United States. Founded in 1643, it is the third-oldest town in Maine. The population was 11,314 at the 2020 census. Wells Beach is a popular summer destination.

==History==
The Abenaki Indians called the area Webhannet, meaning &quot;at the clear stream&quot;, a reference to the Webhannet River.

Edmund Littlefield, an immigrant from the wool regions of Titchfield, England, built the first gristmill and later a woolen mill on the Webhannet River, becoming known as &quot;The Father of Wells,&quot; where a monument commemorates his contribution. In 1622, the Plymouth Company in England awarded to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Lord Proprietor of Maine, territory which included the Plantation of Wells. His young cousin, Thomas Gorges, acting as deputy and agent, in 1641 granted to Rev. John Wheelwright and other settlers from Exeter, New Hampshire the right to populate the land from northeast of the Ogunquit River to southwest of the Kennebunk River. Following the death of the elder Gorges in 1647, the Massachusetts Bay Colony laid claim to Maine. On July 5, 1653, Wells was incorporated, the third town in Maine to do so, and named after Wells, England, a small cathedral city in the county of Somerset. 
After the restoration of Charles II and a meeting in Wells of the trustees of the late Ferdinando Gorges, the British authorities gave a general outline for the local civil and military administration on December 7, 1661.
Wells included Kennebunk, which was set off the year Maine became a state in 1820, and Ogunquit, designated a village within Wells by the legislature in 1913, then set off in 1980.

Wells was the resilient northeastern frontier of English colonial settlement. Except for a few forts and garrisons, early attempts to colonize Maine above Wells were abandoned because of attacks by Native Americans, who resented the encroachment on their territory. Wells endured three major attacks, most famously the Raid on Wells in 1692. The region became less dangerous, however, after the Battle of Louisburg in 1745.

Many early Wells settlers joined the Continental Army; some became Revolutionary War heroes, including Captains Samuel Gooch, Nathanial Littlefield, and Jeremiah Storer. Ocean View Cemetery on Post Road contains a Civil War monument and plot honoring its service members. Visitors can walk to Founder&#x27;s Park just off of Post Road onto Sanford Road, which includes a light walking trail, picnic area, and the first settlement home. Monuments list the names of Wells&#x27; founding families.

The town developed as a farming community, producing hay and vegetables. Other industries included shipbuilding and fisheries. In the 19th century, with the arrival of the railroad, the town&#x27;s sandy beaches attracted tourists. Many inns and hotels were built along the seashore. Today, tourism remains important to the economy.

Wells celebrated its 350th anniversary in 2003. The year-long celebration included a New Year&#x27;s Eve party with fireworks, parade, a visit by the traveling Russian circus, concerts, historical reenactments, and more. The town commissioned a member of the celebration committee, Kristi Borst, to design a town flag. Her design portrays historic aspects of the Town&#x27;s settlement and agriculture as well as the 2003 Town Hall and focus on tourism represented by a train. Also included is the motto she penned for the project: &quot;Proud of our Past, Ready for our Future&quot;.

<text>York is a town in York County, Maine, United States, near the southern tip of the state. The population in the 2020 census was 13,723. Situated beside the Atlantic Ocean on the Gulf of Maine, York is a well-known summer resort town. It is home to three 18-hole golf clubs, four sandy beaches, and Mount Agamenticus. From south to north, it is divided into the villages of Bald Head, York Village, York Harbor, York Beach and Cape Neddick.

York is part of the Portland metropolitan area.

==History==

First settled by Europeans in 1624, the plantation was originally called Agamenticus, the Abenaki term for the York River, which also was the name given to the hill, visible from sea. 

In 1638, settlers changed the name to Bristol after Bristol, England, from which they had immigrated. Envisioning a great city arising from the wilderness, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, lord proprietor of Maine under the Plymouth patent, named the capital of his province Gorgeana. 

On March 1, 1642, by charter of King Charles I, Gorgeana became the first incorporated city in America.

Following Gorges&#x27; death, the Massachusetts Bay Colony claimed his dominion. In 1652, York, Massachusetts, was incorporated from a portion of Gorgeana, making it the second oldest town in Maine after Kittery, incorporated two years earlier. It was named for York, England; however, control of the region was contested between New England and New France, which incited Native Americans to attack English settlements throughout the French and Indian Wars.
The first Congregational church of York was organized in 1672, by Rev. Shubael Dummer, the son of Richard Dummer and uncle to William Dummer, who became acting governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.

During King William&#x27;s War, York was destroyed in the Candlemas Massacre of 1692. During the raid by the Abenakis, Dummer was shot at his own front door. About 50 others were slain and near 100 carried away captive, among them Dummer&#x27;s wife, Lydia, and their son, where &quot;through snows and hardships among those dragons of the desert she also quickly died&quot;; nothing further was heard of the boy.

The final local Indian attack occurred at the Cape Neddick area during Dummer&#x27;s War in 1723. Hostilities diminished with the French defeat at the Siege of Louisbourg (1745), and ceased altogether with the 1763 Treaty of Paris.

===Trading center===
As provincial capital and site of the Royal Gaol (Jail), York prospered. Numerous wharves and warehouses serviced trade with the West Indies. Agricultural products and lumber were shipped in exchange for sugar, molasses and other commodities. One notable merchant was John Hancock, whose establishment is now a museum. Following the Revolution, however, President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Embargo Act of 1807 crippled trade. York, bereft of status as capitol, would not again be prosperous until after the Civil War, when its sea breezes and colonial charm, including old homes like the John Sedgley Homestead, attracted tourists.

===Present day===
Like Bar Harbor and Newport, Rhode Island, York became a fashionable summer resort, and retains many distinctive examples of Gilded Age architecture, particularly in the Shingle style. A cluster of historic buildings in the center of York Village are maintained as museums by the Old York Historical Society.

==The Yorks==
* York Village – including the historic structures, and upscale shops
* York Harbor – with a number of inns, historic homes and large estates
* York Beach – with attractions such as a zoo, arcades, souvenir shops and stores
* Cape Neddick – mainly residences, best known for its lighthouse

During summer months, summer residents and tourists visit Short Sands Beach, which is in the district of York Beach itself, as well as Long Sands Beach, the town&#x27;s longest with more than a mile of sand stretching between York Beach and York Harbor. A number of five-star hotels and other accommodations operate in the York Beach area, although most close after summer.

A number of spots throughout The Yorks have views of the Cape Neddick Light at Nubble Rock, which has figured in both artists&#x27; work and souvenirs of the Maine coast. A photo of the Cape Neddick Light is on the Voyager 1 spacecraft labeled as Seashore, Maine. Visible in clear weather is the tall Boon Island Light on Boon Island, located off York.

===Civil War monument===
A granite monument depicting a Civil War soldier was erected in 1906 at a traffic triangle in York Village. It has been suggested by some that his uniform appears to be incorrect for a Union soldier, as he wears a brimmed fedora and goatee; some local tour guides claim that the uniform is actually Confederate. Another explanation is that either the sculptor, Englishman Frederick Barnicoat, or designer John Staples, mistakenly depicted a uniform from the time of the Spanish–American War. It is also possible that the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment did wear a similar uniform.

<text>York Harbor is a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of York in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 3,033 at the 2010 census. York Harbor is a distinguished former Gilded Age summer colony noted for its resort architecture. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

York was a prosperous seaport in the 18th century. Its harbor, then known as Lower Town, was lined with wharves and warehouses to which upriver settlers brought their goods for trade and shipping. The tongue of land at the mouth of the York River was called Gallows Point, where criminals at Old York Gaol in York Village were hanged. At high tide the tongue became an island, from which a ferry licensed in 1652 crossed to Seabury.

During the American Revolution, fishermen and their families abandoned the Isles of Shoals off the coast and floated their homes to the Lower Town waterfront, where they were rebuilt. They hauled their boats at Lobster Cove and dried their catch on fish flakes, after which the tongue would be named Stage Neck. In 1807, President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s embargo crippled local mercantile trade, and by the Civil War, Stage Neck had deteriorated into a ramshackle slum.

After the Union victory, Nathaniel Grant Marshall (1812-1882), a lawyer, had a vision to convert the poorest section of Lower Town into a first-class summer emporium for wealthy tourists. He bought Stage Neck, razed the fishermen&#x27;s shacks and in 1871 built a grand hotel called the Marshall House. As part of its upgrade, Lower Town was renamed York Harbor. Steamers began arriving with families drawn to the Maine shore from the heat and pollution in Boston, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Many liked the area enough to build summer mansions, characteristically in the Shingle Style, during the 1880-1890 boom. Soon York Harbor joined Bar Harbor and Newport as fashionable East Coast summer destinations.
Competing hotels were built, including Harmon Hall and the Albracca Hotel. But the Marshall House was the largest, accommodating 325 guests by 1900. It offered telephone and telegraph offices, a livery stable, riding and bathing facilities, tennis courts, barbershop, billiards room, ballroom, sailing, fishing excursions and canoes for picnics up the York River. The Marshalls started both an electric and water company, and headed the effort to build the York Harbor &amp; Beach Railroad, opened in 1887.

When the Marshall House burned in 1916, it was rebuilt in fire-resistant brick the following year to designs by noted Portland architect John Calvin Stevens. It resumed its role as the center of York Harbor social life. At its porte-cochère, chauffeur-driven limousines from the estates deposited their owners in evening gowns and tuxedoes, to be joined by hotel patrons for dinner at 7:30 p.m. Post-prandial entertainments included chamber music by a Boston Symphony ensemble in the lobby, or Saturday dancing and costume parties in the ballroom.

But a rift grew between York Harbor and York Beach further up the coast, which catered to the less affluent. The former disapproved of the latter&#x27;s &quot;cottage and campground&quot; philosophy, and tried to prevent the trolley connecting the two. In 1908, York Harbor proposed secession from York, first as a new town called Yorktown, then as Gorges after Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the early proprietor of Maine. Because the split would have deprived remaining York of much of real value within the community, including the town hall, it failed and The Yorks reconciled.
Development here began in the 1870s and virtually ended in the 1920s, leaving York Harbor a microcosm of period resort architecture, now converted for year-round use. The Marshall House was sold in 1957 and demolished in 1972, to be replaced with condominiums and the Stage Neck Inn (designed by Sasaki, Dawson, DeMay Associates). However, the York community retains a wealth of Second Empire, Shingle Style, Mission Revival and Colonial Revival architecture. Of particular note are the Lancaster Building designed by E. B. Blaisdell and built in 1895, Trinity Episcopal Church designed by H. J. Hardenbergh and built in 1908, and the York Harbor Reading Room designed by James Purdon and built in 1910. The Cliff Walk, an ancient shoreline path lined with beach roses, winds along Eastern Point ledges above the surf.

<text>Barton is a town in Allegany County, Maryland, United States, located along the Georges Creek Valley. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 457 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The Reverend William Shaw, a Methodist minister settled on the site of Barton in 1794. His son, William Shaw Jr. laid out the town in 1853, naming it for his father&#x27;s hometown, Barton-upon-Humber, England.

The discovery of coal in the area attracted more settlers. They came from Scotland, Ireland and Germany, eager to work in the mines. In 1853, the first shipment of coal was made on the newly built Georges Creek Railroad. Eventually, all the deep coal mines had been abandoned and replaced by strip mines, several of which are still in operation and can be seen from the town. Today, most families in Barton are supported by other types of employment.

The first gristmill powered by a water wheel was built on Moores Run by Henry Ingram. It was about 200 to 300 ft. from the confluence of Georges Creek. The mill at Moores Run was owned and tended by Mathias Ball. Ball also owned and ran a tannery at Butcher Run in Barton. The second gristmill was built at Mill Run south of Barton, it was called the Morrison Mill, and was owned by John Morrison. The Morrison Mill was located where Mill Run flows into Georges Creek. John Haymaker also tended the Hockenberry Mill before Hockenberry took over. The third mill was the Shaw Mill, built by the Shaw family. It was a large mill built of stone at Moscow. It was torn down in the summer or fall of 1961.

Major Barton-area coal companies in the 19th century:
* American Coal Company, owner of the Swanton and Caledonia Mines. Their coal tipples were located right in Barton and the mines were located on the mountain on the west side of Barton.
* Davis &amp; Rieman Co.
* Piedmont Coal &amp; Iron Co., located up Temperance Row on the east side of the mountain.
* Potomac Coal Co., located up Moore&#x27;s Run. The first mine was located about ½ mile from Dogwood Flat and the No. 2 mine was about 1-1/4 mile up the run. Owned by the Union Mining Co.
* Swanton Mining Co.
* George&#x27;s Creek Mining Co.
* Barton Coal Mining Co., located at the top of Moores Run.

The Barton Coal Company plane (or cable railway) was built in 1854 and was engineered by O.D. Robbins. It remained in operation until March 21, 1898. The next week the tract, cables and mining equipment were removed. Along with the major mines, there were also many small family-owned mines on the family farms, which catered to the local coal trade.

The Pickell Mine was located on the west side of Barton towards Moscow. Its tipple was not located in town.

The Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad, successor to the Georges Creek Railroad, opened a train station in Barton in 1889. The station was demolished in the mid-20th century.

Today Barton has four churches and many volunteer groups. There is a lighted ball field, a playground, and two parks for use by citizens. Barton has survived floods and fires and still maintains its peaceful and congenial atmosphere. Each year the town celebrates itself with a Party in the Park. That get-together showcases crafts, food, entertainment, and a parade through the center of town.

Shaw Mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.

<text>Cumberland is a city in and the county seat of Allegany County, Maryland, United States. At the 2020 census, the city had a population of 19,075. Located on the Potomac River, Cumberland is a regional business and commercial center for Western Maryland and the Potomac Highlands of West Virginia. It is the primary city of the Cumberland metropolitan area, which had 95,044 residents in 2020.

Historically, Cumberland was known as the &quot;Queen City&quot; as it was once the second largest in the state. Because of its strategic location on what became known as the Cumberland Road through the Appalachians, after the American Revolution it served as a historical outfitting and staging point for westward emigrant trail migrations throughout the first half of the 1800s. In this role, it supported the settlement of the Ohio Country and the lands in that latitude of the Louisiana Purchase. It also became an industrial center, served by major roads, railroads, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which connected Cumberland to Washington, D.C. and is now a national historical park. Today, Interstate 68 bisects the town.

Industry declined after World War II, leading urban, business, and technological development in the state to be concentrated in eastern coastal cities. Today, the Cumberland metropolitan area is one of the poorest in the United States, ranking 305th out of 318 metropolitan areas in per capita income.

==History==

Cumberland was named by English colonists after the son of King George II, Prince William, the Duke of Cumberland. It is built on the site of the mid-18th century Fort Cumberland, the starting point for British General Edward Braddock&#x27;s ill-fated attack on the French stronghold of Fort Duquesne (present-day Pittsburgh) during the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War between the French and the British. (See Braddock expedition.) This area had been settled for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. The fort was developed along the Great Indian Warpath which tribes used to travel the backcountry.

Cumberland also served as an outpost of Colonel George Washington during the French and Indian War, and his first military headquarters was built here. Washington returned as President of the United States in 1794 to Cumberland to review troops assembled to thwart the Whiskey Rebellion.
During the 19th century, Cumberland was a key road, railroad and canal junction. It became the second-largest city in Maryland after the port city of Baltimore. It was nicknamed &quot;The Queen City&quot;. Cumberland was the terminus, and namesake, of the Cumberland Road (begun in 1811) that extended westward to the Ohio River at Wheeling, West Virginia. This was the first portion of what would be constructed as the National Road, which eventually reached Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. In the 1850s, many black fugitives reached their final stop on the Underground Railroad beneath the floor of the Emmanuel Episcopal Church. A maze of tunnels beneath and an abolitionist pastor above provided refuge before the final five mile trip to freedom in Pennsylvania.

The surrounding hillsides were mined for coal and iron ore, and harvested for timber that helped supply the Industrial Revolution. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal had its western terminus here; it was built to improve the movement of goods between the Midwest and Washington, DC, the eastern terminus. Construction of railroads superseded use of the canal, as trains were faster and could carry more freight. The city developed as a major manufacturing center, with industries in glass, breweries, fabrics, tires, and tinplate.

With the restructuring of heavy industry in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states following World War II, the city lost many jobs. As a result, its population has declined by nearly half, from 39,483 in the 1940 census to fewer than 20,000 today.

==Geography==
Cumberland is in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians at the junction of the North Branch Potomac River and Wills Creek. The majority of the land within the city lies in a valley created by the junction of these two streams. Interstate 68 runs through the city in an east–west direction, as does Alternate U.S. 40, the Old National Road. U.S. Highway 220 runs north–south. Parts of Wills Mountain, Haystack Mountain, and Shriver Ridge are also within the city limits. Opposite Cumberland along the Potomac River is Ridgeley, West Virginia.
The abandoned Chesapeake and Ohio Canal is now part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The canal&#x27;s towpath is maintained, allowing travel by foot, horse or bicycle between Cumberland and Washington, D.C., a distance of approximately . In recent years, a separate trail/path extension, called the Great Allegheny Passage, has been developed that leads to Pittsburgh as its western terminus. Cumberland is the only city of at least 20,000 residents, outside of the Pittsburgh and DC metro areas, that lies on this combined 300+ mile stretch.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
Cumberland lies at the beginning of the transition from a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) to a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), although bearing far more characteristics of the former, with a range of temperatures significantly lower than those in the central and eastern part of Maryland, mostly in the form of depressed nighttime lows.

The region has four distinct seasons, with hot, humid summers, and moderate winters (compared to surrounding communities, Cumberland receives milder winters and less snow). Monthly daily mean temperatures range from in January to in July, with temperatures exceeding on 34.5 days of the year and dipping to or below on 7 nights per winter. Average seasonal snowfall totals . The record high is set in July 1936 and August 1918, both of which are state record highs, while the record low is set at the current site on January 18–19 1994 and January 20–21, 1985.

==Demographics==
The median household income $25,142, and the median family income was $34,500. Males had a median income of $29,484 versus $20,004 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,813. About 15.3% of families and 19.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 29.4% of those under age 18 and 10.3% of those age 65 or over. The Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area ranked 305th out of 318 metropolitan areas in per capita income.

In 2007, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked the Cumberland Metro as having the 6th-lowest cost of living in the US, based on an index of cost of housing, utilities, transportation and other expenditures.

In 2007, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; newspaper, citing the National Association of Realtors figures on home prices, stated that while most areas were stagnant, Cumberland home prices were rising by more than 17%, the highest in the country. In July 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; writer Stephanie Cavanaugh wrote that the great quality of living in Cumberland had attracted many urbanites to the area.

Population trends

Population decline from 1950 to 1990 was due to a string of industrial plant closures. Plants such as Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Allegany Munitions and Celanese closed down and relocated as part of widespread industrial restructuring after WWII. The 1987 closure of the Kelly Springfield Tire Plant marked a turning point, as it was the last major manufacturing plant in the city limits to close its doors.

The population of the city has continued to decline since 1990, with the 2010 census population of 20,859 the lowest since the 1900 census.

===2010 census===

The racial makeup of the city was 89.4% White, 6.4% African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.3% from other races, and 2.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 1.2% of the population.

There were 9,223 households, of which 25.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.0% were married couples living together, 15.1% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 46.0% were non-families. 38.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 18.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.19 and the average family size was 2.89.

The median age in the city was 41.4 years. 20.9% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.2% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 23.1% were from 25 to 44; 26.2% were from 45 to 64; and 19.6% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 47.0% male and 53.0% female.

The Narrows is a compact notched valley that Wills Creek has carved into Wills Mountain. Inventor Frederick John Bahr bought Wills Mountain and built his log cabin on top.

The National Road (U.S. Route 40) and a number of railroad lines pass through this steep, narrow, and rocky river valley on the edge of Cumberland. On the northeast side of Wills Mountain, sits a rocky outcropping known as Lover&#x27;s Leap. The name comes from a Native American Romeo and Juliet legend. The tale tells how a jilted lover met his end by jumping off this ledge. Today, the rocks high above the water provide extensive views of the Allegheny Mountains. Lover&#x27;s Leap has been frequently romanticized by postcard pictures of this valley, including those taken by George Steward in 1950 and published in the 1953 book &quot;U.S. 40&quot;.

Lover&#x27;s Leap is above sea level and made up of oddly squared projections of rock, from its top, all the way down to the National Highway (U.S. Rte. 40) below. The City of Cumberland and the neighboring states of Pennsylvania and West Virginia may be seen from this point.

In 1864 the state legislature provided funds, and a structure for obtaining local funds from taxes and private donations for the purpose of funding schools for Negroes. The first public school for African-Americans in Cumberland operated in a colored YMCA on Independence Street, and was named the Mary Hoye school. In 1923 a new school for blacks was built on Frederick Street. In 1941 an election was held of students and faculty, and the school was renamed George Washington Carver School. In addition to serving the local population, many black people from surrounding areas in West Virginia sent their children to Carver because of the inadequate local facilities. The schools were integrated in 1955, when 54 African American children attended the white schools. In 1956, 3 black students became the first to graduate from Allegany County&#x27;s newly integrated schools.

The offices of Allegany County Public Schools are located in Cumberland.

<text>Frostburg is a city in Allegany County, Maryland. It is located at the head of the Georges Creek Valley, west of Cumberland.

==History==
===19th century===
Frostburg had its beginnings back in 1811 when surveying began for the National Pike, a road used to transport crops and raw materials to East Coast markets. President Thomas Jefferson had authorized construction of the road in 1806. Meshach Frost built the first house in present-day Frostburg in 1812 and named it Highland Hall (on the present-day the site of St. Michael&#x27;s Church and Rectory). This building was a popular stopping point for celebrities and dignitaries who traveled the National Pike. This would be followed by the Franklin Hotel and other hotels.

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal reached Cumberland in 1842 and 1850, respectively. Consequently, travel on the National Pike saw a steady decline, although travel through Frostburg did not. Coal mining was the first major economic draw, but the industry faced problems in its early manifestation. The mountains of western Maryland and Frostburg proved to make transportation of coal very difficult. Not until the completion of the railroads did the coal industry in Frostburg began to flourish. The first major coal producer was Meshech Frost, who owned a significant amount of land for mining and founded the Frostburg Coal Company. This eventually was sold to the much larger Consolidated Coal Company.

Structures from the coal industry&#x27;s dominant period still remain. One of the major freight depots for coal is located at 19 Depot St. in Frostburg and is one of the few remaining depots in western Maryland. The Mount Savage Railroad was the first to build a rail line to Frostburg in 1852, and it connected to the B&amp;O Railroad in Cumberland, as well as the C&amp;O Canal. The Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad (C&amp;P) took over the Mount Savage line in 1854, and expanded with the construction of a tunnel under Frostburg, and a rail line southward to Piedmont, West Virginia. This railroad and tunnel were used to transport coal between Frostburg and George&#x27;s Creek. Another major economic turn for Frostburg was the manufacture of fire brick beginning in 1864, utilizing the high-grade fire clays which are found in the area. One of the main businesses that formed was the Big Savage Fire Brick Company, still one of the main suppliers of fire bricks on the East Coast.

In 1898, the Maryland General Assembly authorized State Normal School #2 and a $20,000 appropriation to construct a building, though no money to buy land. The money for the land was collected among local citizens, many of them coal miners and their families.

Two years later the first building, Old Main, opened. Two years after that, the first classes were held. The only available course of study at that point was a two-year elementary-education program. In 1904, the first class graduated.

In 1934, State Normal School #2 introduced its first four-year program. Nearly 30 years later (1963), the school finally was renamed Frostburg State College. In the next ten years more programs sprouted, including the university&#x27;s first graduate program (Master&#x27;s of Science in management).

In 1987, Frostburg State College joined the University System of Maryland and was renamed Frostburg State University. FSU celebrated its centennial in 1998.
