<text>Lake Crystal is a city in Blue Earth County, Minnesota, United States, established in 1869. The population was 2,539 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Mankato-North Mankato Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===First arrivals===
In 1853, two families from small towns near Ithaca, New York, left their homes and traveled west. One was 32-year-old William Riley Robinson. In June 1854 Robinson and his companion Lucius O. Hunt traveled from Wisconsin to Blue Earth County. Robinson and Hunt arrived and came upon the three nearby lakes, Loon, Crystal, and Lily, and marveled at their beauty. They returned for their families and headed back to settle in the Lake Crystal area. The families were joined by two other men and their families, Calvin Webb and Samuel Thorne. Robinson and his family settled in a log cabin on the south shore of Crystal Lake, a few feet south of where the Robinson House is today. Hunt and his family settled in a log cabin on the south shore of Lily Lake, where Holy Family Catholic Church is now. Each man took plots of land one mile long and half a mile wide (the dividing line being modern-day Main Street), the deeds to which were signed by President James Buchanan. Webb settled in the Judson Township, while Thorne took a claim on Crystal Lake. During the Dakota War of 1862 the settlers escaped to the fort at Mankato. Eventually the Dakota uprising was subdued and the settlers returned and rebuilt their homes. Hunt built a brick house in 1869 that was torn down in the mid-1900s, where Holy Family Catholic Church is today. Robinson built his brick house in 1870, which still stands as a historical building on Robinson Street.

===Town founding and 1800s===
In June 1857, a town named Crystal Lake City was planned out on the southwest shore of Crystal Lake, but it failed to become reality. In October 1868, The Valley Railroad, later the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis, &amp; Omaha Railroad, was completed in the area. The railroad, after looking for potential locations, choose Lake Crystal for a new station. And so Lake Crystal began along the railroad, and was platted by Robinson and Hunt in 1869. The railroads&#x27; engineer, General Judson W. Bishop of Saint Paul, named the town after nearby Crystal Lake. A post office began operation in Lake Crystal in 1869. By December 1, 1869, the town had a grain elevator, hotel, schoolhouse, grocery, drugstore, hardware store, two general stores, harness shop, cooper shop, and a doctor&#x27;s office. Lake Crystal was incorporated as a city on February 24, 1870. Its first newspaper, &quot;The People&#x27;s Journal&quot;, started in March 1870. The period between 1870 and 1895 is generally known as the “Wheat Era”; most local farmers used nearly all their cropland for wheat. Lake Crystal&#x27;s economy was adversely affected by the grasshopper invasion of 1873, when millions of grasshoppers devoured all the crops. The plague lasted until June 1877, when the grasshoppers fled. It took years to recover; only in 1882 were good quantities of wheat again marketed at the local grain elevator. In 1879, the Elmore railroad line was completed, with Lake Crystal as a junction between this line and the old main line. This rail line connected Lake Crystal to Garden City, Vernon Center, Amboy, Winnebago, Blue Earth, and Elmore. No fewer than 23 trains passed through town each day. In 1882, land was purchased from the railway for $100 and a new, two-story brick schoolhouse was built. This building was added onto in 1895 and 1905 and demolished in 1972. In 1885, a 16-man volunteer fire department was founded to combat several outbreaks of fire in the area. On September 20, 1887, a fire broke out at 3AM in the town&#x27;s business block. A man was seen pouring gasoline throughout one of the buildings, then lighting it. Within a few hours the fire was under control; it was extinguished with the help of Mankato&#x27;s Fire Department. This fire damaged and destroyed about seven buildings. Also in 1887, All Angels Episcopal Church was built on the corner of Main and Howard Streets; it was torn down in 1964. In 1890 the United Methodist Church was built on the corner of Humphrey and Crystal Streets. In 1893 the Lake Crystal Boat Club built a boat pavilion at modern-day Robinson Park. The Boat Club also launched a steamship, the &quot;New Era&quot;, which is believed to have sunk near the lake&#x27;s south shore. Norwegian Lutherans built a church on the corner of Anna and Shepherd Streets in 1893, later renamed Zion Lutheran. In 1894, the Graif Brothers Flour Mill was built, which marketed flour to Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Glasgow, Scotland. By 1895 Lake Crystal had over 1,100 residents. In 1896, Catholics built their first church, on Humphrey Street. In 1898, space was made for a new electric light plant between the Graif Flour Mill main building and engine room. Power-line poles also arrived and were installed along 16 streets. Lake Crystal received electricity in December 1898. The Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Church was constructed in 1899 on the corner of Prince and Crystal Streets.

===1900s===
The Graif Brothers Flour Mill burned down in 1901 and was replaced in 1902 by the Lake Crystal Milling Company Plant, which was torn down in the late 1980s. The Lake Crystal First National Bank building was built in 1902 on Main Street, and held the bank until the 1920s. In 1905 the main railroad and depot in town was moved north to the south shore of Lily Lake, where the railroad resides today. In 1908, the first water tower was built, standing about 110 feet tall. It was torn down in 1995. On October 10, 1919, the Lake Crystal American Legion John W. Roth Post 294 was established by 15 Lake Crystal World War I veterans. Also in 1919, Main Street was paved and the sewer system was reconditioned. The &quot;Lake Crystal Tribune&quot; began publishing weekly in December 1921. In 1926 a new hospital was built on Main Street, run by Fred Franchere. Also in 1926, a new school addition was added. It was demolished in 2007. In 1937, the City Municipal Power Plant was built, and still provides power to the city today. On January 1, 1937, an accidental fire destroyed the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Church. The present-day First Presbyterian Church was built in 1937 on the corner of Prince and Crystal Streets. The Minnesota Valley Gas Company began to serve the community in 1941. Trinity Lutheran Church was built in 1947 on the corner of Watonwan and Main Street. The present-day Holy Family Catholic Church was built in 1951, replacing the Humphrey Street Catholic church. In 1954, another school addition was built, which was demolished in 2007. Zion Lutheran Church moved to its present site on the corner of Robinson and Crystal Street in 1957. In 1959, the Crystal CO OP elevator was built. It had 2,200,000 bushel grain bins added to it in the late 1960s to early 1970s. Highway 60 was moved closer to the railroad and became a four-lane highway in 1968, replacing the old highway, also known as Lily Street. In 1970 a new post office was built on the corner of Prince and Main Street, which is still in use today. In 1971, an elementary school was built along County Road 9. In 1973 the Lake Crystal National Bank was moved from 101 South Main Street to a new building, which is now owned by MinnStar Bank. The city population reached 2,068 in 1978. In the 1970s, three historic buildings were demolished on south Main Street and replaced by the Lake Crystal Towers, a five-story apartment building built in 1978. A new City Hall was built in 1980 in Marston Park, and was added onto in 2017. In 1983, Crystal Valley built a new, two-bin, concrete grain elevator. It added three larger bins in 1985, and is still in use today. Also in 1983, the Baptists moved from their Humphrey Street church to their present one on Oakland Street. A new wastewater treatment plant opened along County Road 20 North in 1987. The Elmore Line was removed in the 1980s along with the many grain elevators along its path. A new Lake Crystal Fire Hall was built in 1988 on Hunt Street, replacing the Fire Hall at 101 North Main Street, which is now the police department. In 1995 a new water tower was built between Hunt and Lincoln Streets which was painted tan, and is still in use today. In the late 1990s to early 2000s, five historical buildings on Humphrey Street were demolished. In 1999 Crystal Gardens housing developments were constructed at the end of Blue Earth Street, which now houses 40 residences.

===2000s===
A public recreation center was built on the corner of south Main Street and 510th Avenue in 2000. It contains a public pool, gymnasium, walking track, and exercise room. In the early 2000s the Lily Lake Estates, Crystal Creek, and Nathan Street housing developments began, or were under construction. POET Biorefining built a new ethanol plant about two miles west of town along Highway 60 in 2004. In 2005, multiple houses were demolished near the intersection of Main Street and Highway 60 and replaced by Kevin&#x27;s Market Grocery Store. In 2007 a new secondary school was built along 510th Avenue to replace the old school on Murphy Street. Crystal Seasons Senior Living Center was built on the lot that belonged to the old Lake Crystal high school in 2008, replacing the retirement home off Highway 60 on LaClaire Street, which was demolished. United Methodist Church sold its building, and built a new one on the corner of Main Street and 510th Avenue, renaming it Cornerstone UMC in 2015. In recent years the Crystal Waters Project has cleaned up the nearby lakes that have been contaminated over several years by nearby farming and sludging. On August 8, 2016, a storm severely damaged the 57-year-old Crystal CO OP Elevator, which was demolished within the following months. The watertower was repainted light blue in 2018.

<text>Mapleton Township is a township in Blue Earth County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 310 as of the 2000 census.

==History==
Mapleton Township was organized in 1861, and named from the Maple River.

Mapleton Township was first settled in 1856 and was first known as Sherman Township, named for Isaac sherman, one of the original settlers. The area included the present townships of Sterling, Mapleton, and Danville. School District No. 5 was organized on the same date and covered the same territory. Two years later, in April 1858, present-day Sterling Township was organized under the name of Mapleton but was renamed &quot;Sterling Township&quot; in 1859. With the separation of the two towns, the present names were adopted. The first town meetings of the independent municipalities were held in April 1861.

===The Mapleton Colony===
In the winter of 1854-55 A. Murphy, a New York City school teacher, ran a newspaper ad for a meeting to form a colony to locate in the territory of Minnesota to establish their homes. Through advertising the colony drew membership from the northeastern states, the majority from New York; almost all had English or Scottish surnames.

The group that came out of this was called The Minnesota Settlement Association, with A. Murphy as the president. Robert Taylor was authorized to go to southern Minnesota to select the best location for the settlement. Taylor came to Blue Earth County in the winter of 1855-56 and was helped by L.G.M. Fletcher, who had originally helped survey lands around Sterling and Mapleton Townships. The only settlers in this area at this time were V.A. Highland and his two brothers-in-law, Barnabas W. Simmons and Horace M. DeWolf.

Settlement members bought shares for $10 each which entitled them to cheap transportation west, an opportunity to claim 160 acres of farmland, and one lot in a town site to be platted in the center of the settlement.

Most of the colony left from New York City in April 1856. They had made an agreement with a railroad company to carry them to Dunleith, Illinois, then the nearest point to Minnesota to be reached by railroad, across the Mississippi River from Dubuque, Iowa.

Some of the colonies, especially from Illinois, Indiana and Iowa, made the trip overland across Iowa, to Minnesota, with the wagon and stock. The majority made the journey by steamboat, up the Mississippi River then down the Minnesota River to Mankato. There were 350 adults and 90 children in the party. After a few days thé colonists started for the land that Mr. Taylor had secured by foot and ox cart. They arrived in the spring of 1856. There were 30 tents, 12 feet x 25 feet, to shelter the entire company until houses could be built.

The land blocked out into claims of 160 acres each, but only 65 claims had the desired amount of timber. Three of the head officers were allowed to pick first. The rest of the claims were numbered and divided into lots for the 139 people entitled to a claim.

With more than half the tickets blank it resulted in great dissatisfaction with widespread fighting that followed and a great deal of claim jumping. Most of the disappointed scattered; some went to the timber country near Mankato, others crossed into Faribault County, and a large number returned east very disgruntaled.

==History==

Shelby Township was organized in 1858, the year Minnesota achieved statehood. The township&#x27;s main inducement to settlement was its rich prairie loam, rendered still more attractive by the availability of wood lots along the Blue Earth River. By 1860, Shelby Township was the most populous in Blue Earth County. In addition to its 315 residents, it also sustained a small but thriving village known as &quot;Shelbyville&quot;, located in Section 35, about two miles south of modern Amboy. In the early 1860s Shelbyville hosted the county fair. The town included a hotel, church, schoolhouse, mill, two stores, a blacksmith shop, a wagon shop, and a post office.

By 1875, Shelby Township was a relatively mature agricultural area, well known for grains and livestock. At that time, the township&#x27;s population was 800, and it remained at approximately the same level for the next thirty years. Despite such overall stability, there were some significant population shifts within the township itself.

The main catalyst for change was the St. Paul and Sioux City Railway (later a part of the Omaha Road), which in 1879 built a north–south branch line through Blue Earth County. In several townships along the proposed route, residents offered the railroad financial incentives to locate a depot in their vicinity. For reasons that are not completely clear, the citizens of Shelbyville declined to do so. On September 2, 1879, they voted down a proposition to give the railroad a $10,000 grant. A week earlier, however, a group of farmers residing two miles north of Shelbyville had made the railroad an offer of their own.

The farmers&#x27; proposal, which was accepted, was to buy forty acres of land for the railroad, if the railroad would lay out town lots, build a depot, and build a grain elevator. The town, named Amboy, was laid out in October 1879. This triggered the death of Shelbyville, which was deserted within three years, the buildings having been moved to other locations. Incorporating as a city in 1887, Amboy had more than 400 inhabitants by the turn of the century.

<doc id="119578" wikidata="Q545119" url="?curid=119578" title="New Ulm, Minnesota">
<text>New Ulm ( ) is a city and the county seat of Brown County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 14,120 at the 2020 census. It is located on the triangle of land formed by the confluence of the Minnesota River and the Cottonwood River.

The city is home to the Hermann Heights Monument, Flandrau State Park, the historic August Schell Brewing Company, and the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame. The city is known for its German heritage and its historical sites and landmarks dating back to the US-Dakota War of 1862.

New Ulm is the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of New Ulm and home to the Handmaids of the Heart of Jesus. The Dakota called New Ulm the &quot;Village on the Cottonwood&quot; or Wachupata.

==History==

===Settlement===

The city was founded in 1854 by the German Land Company of Chicago. The city was named after the city of Ulm in the state of Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany. Ulm and Neu-Ulm (which may have inspired the name) are twin cities, with Ulm on the Baden-Württemberg side of the Danube River and Neu-Ulm on the Bavarian side. In part due to the American city&#x27;s German heritage, it became a center for brewing in the Upper Midwest. It is home to the August Schell Brewing Company. The Sioux called it Wakzupata which roughly means the &quot;village on the cottonwood&quot;.

In 1856, the Settlement Association of the Socialist Turner Society (&quot;Turners&quot;) helped to secure the future of New Ulm. The Turners (German for &quot;gymnasts&quot;) originated in Germany in the first half of the nineteenth century, whose motto was &quot;Sound Mind, Sound Body&quot;. Their clubs combined gymnastics with lectures and debates about the issues of the day. Following the failed Revolutions of 1848, numerous Germans emigrated to the United States. In their new land, Turners formed associations (&quot;Vereins&quot;) throughout the eastern, midwestern, and western states. This was the largest secular German-American organization in the country in the nineteenth century.

Following a series of attacks by nativist mobs in major cities such as Chicago, Cincinnati, and Louisville, a national convention of Turners authorized the formation of a colony on the frontier. Intending to develop a community that expressed Turner ideals, the Settlement Association joined the Chicago Germans who had struggled here due to a lack of capital. The Turners supplied that, as well as hundreds of colonists from the east who arrived in 1856.

The city plan represented Turner ideals. The German Land Company hired Christian Prignitz to complete the plan for New Ulm, which was filed in April 1858. This master plan for New Ulm expressed a grand vision of the city&#x27;s future. At the heart of the community stood blocks reserved for Turner Hall, the county courthouse, and a public school, representing the political, social, and educational center of the community. The westernmost avenues were named after American heroes George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine—the latter three noted for their freethinking philosophies. Members were given the means to support themselves — in harmony with nature — through the distribution of four-acre garden lots located outside the residential area. Historian Dennis Gimmestad wrote, 
&quot;The founders’ goals created a community persona that sets New Ulm apart from the Minnesota towns founded by land speculators or railroad companies... The New Ulm founders aspired to establish a town with a defined philosophical, economic, and social character&quot;.

===U.S.–Dakota War of 1862===

On August 18, 1862, the US-Dakota War began with the attack at the Lower Sioux Agency only 30 miles up the Minnesota River from New Ulm. As the closest significant town to the Dakota Reservation, New Ulm fell under attack by a Mdewakanton force the next day. A hastily formed militia of armed townspeople repelled the attack and immediately set about constructing barricades around the center of the town.

The Dakota returned with a larger force on the morning of August 23. Bolstered by the timely arrival of volunteer militia from other towns under Charles Flandrau, the outnumbered defenders of New Ulm again repelled the attack. Most of the town outside the barricades was burned, however, leaving only 49 buildings to house a population of 2500. Short of shelter and ammunition and facing outbreaks of disease, the majority of the population evacuated to Mankato on August 25. The dead were buried in New Ulm&#x27;s streets.

===1881 Tornado===
On July 15, 1881, New Ulm was struck by a large tornado that killed six people and injured 53.

===World War I and II===
Between the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and U.S. entry into the conflict, the citizens of New Ulm closely followed events in Europe. Local newspapers sometimes printing news from relatives and friends in Germany. In an unofficial referendum in early April 1917, local voters opposed war by a margin of 466 to 19. Even as President Woodrow Wilson prepared his Declaration of War, a Brown County delegation arrived in Washington, D.C. to voice its opposition to that action.

On the national level, the Wilson administration organized an active campaign to suppress antiwar fervor, joined on the state level by Minnesota Governor James Burnquist. The Minnesota Commission of Public Safety was granted broad powers to protect the state and assist in the war effort. Specific actions taken by the commission included surveillance of alleged subversive activities, mobilization of opposition to labor unions and strikes (which were considered even more suspect in wartime), pursuit of draft evaders, and registration and monitoring of aliens (foreign nationals).

Given the strong German heritage of New Ulm residents, federal and state agents began to visit the city soon after the United States&#x27; entry into the Great War. They filed reports to offices in Washington and St. Paul because immigrants and first-generation ethnics were suspected of having divided loyalties at best, and perhaps favoring Prussia and the Central Powers. Locally, several business and civic leaders joined in efforts to root out antiwar fervor.

On July 25, 1917, a massive rally, attended by 10,000 people, was held on the grounds of Turner Hall. The people had gathered to “enter a protest against sending American soldiers to a foreign country.” Speakers included Louis Fritsche, mayor of New Ulm; Albert Pfaender, city attorney and former minority leader of the Minnesota House of Representatives; Adolph Ackermann, director of Dr. Martin Luther College; and F. H. Retzlaff, a prominent businessman. Federal and state agents mingled through the crowd, gathering information.

A month later, Governor Burnquist removed Fritsche and Pfaender from their positions. The Commission of Public Safety pressured the college to fire Ackermann. These blows sharply divided the community — on one side, many residents took the removals as an attack on the city&#x27;s heritage and traditions. Albert Pfaender was the son, and Fritsche, the son-in-law, of the city&#x27;s principal founder, Wilhelm Pfaender. On the other side, prominent local businessmen, including flour mill managers, feared economic repercussions and promoted pro-war parades and bond drives.

During World War II, German POWs were housed in a camp to the immediate southeast of New Ulm, in what is now Flandrau State Park. In 1944, a New Ulm family was fined $300 for removing a prisoner from the camp, housing him, and taking him to church.

==Historic sites==
===Turner Hall===
New Ulm Turner Hall, with the oldest section constructed in 1873, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It is the oldest Turner Hall in the United States still in its original use. The north half of the building is a combination of exterior wall elements of a 1901 hall/theater that burned in 1952 with a 1953 interior and main facade. Turner Hall remains one of the most active in the country and one that continues its original mission at the same location after more than 150 years. Its Rathskeller is likely the oldest continuously used bar in Minnesota, while its gymnastics program is also the oldest in the state. The Rathskeller features murals of scenes from Germany, painted by Guido Methua (1873), Christian Heller (1887), and Anton Gag (1901). These were recently restored with support from a grant from the Minnesota Historical Society.

===Brown County Historical Society===
The Brown County Historical Society, located at 2 North Broadway houses 3 floors of exhibits and one of the largest archives in the state. It contains over 5,500 family files, microfilm of census, naturalization, church, cemetery and birth and death records as well as business and history files.

===Defender&#x27;s monument===
Located at Center and State Streets, Defender&#x27;s Monument was erected in 1891 by the State of Minnesota to honor the memory of the defenders who aided New Ulm during the Dakota War of 1862. The artwork at the base was created by New Ulm artist Anton Gag. The monument has not been changed since its completion except for being moved to the middle of the block.

===Hermann monument===
The Hermann Monument in New Ulm dominates the Minnesota River valley from a hill overlooking the city. Inspired by a similar monument called &quot;Hermannsdenkmal&quot; near Detmold, Germany, the figure served as a symbol for members of the Sons of Hermann, a fraternal organization of German Americans. In 1885, the 362 Sons of Hermann lodges across the country committed themselves to the construction of a monument representing their cultural heritage. Through the efforts of Minnesota&#x27;s 53 Sons of Hermann lodges, the monument was built in New Ulm, home to many German immigrants. The sculptor chosen for this project was a German sculptor from Ohio, Alfons Pelzer. A delegation from New Ulm visited Ulm in 2009 and went up to the Teutoburger Forest and Detmold, in northern Germany, to commemorate the 2000th anniversary of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, when Arminius, a chieftain of the Cherusci, a Germanic tribe, defeated a Roman army, led by Varus.

===German Bohemian monument===
A monument to German-Bohemian immigration to America is located in New Ulm. It was erected in 1991 by the German-Bohemian Heritage Society to honor the German-Bohemian immigrants who arrived the area, mostly by a boat landing on the Minnesota River some 150 yards to the east. The immigrants came mostly from small villages, with the largest number from the village centers of Hostau, Muttersdorf, and Ronsperg. Most of the immigrants were Catholic farmers who spoke a Bohemian dialect of German.

Inscribed in granite slabs around the base of the monument are the surnames of over 350 immigrant families. Many of these names are still prominent in the region. As more and more immigrants arrived, not all of whom could farm, they settled in the city of New Ulm and some of the small communities to the west and north.

The bronze statue that rests on top of the granite base was designed and sculpted by Leopold Hafner, a German-Bohemian sculptor who now lives near Passau, Germany.

Sleepy Eye took its name from Sleepy Eye Lake, which was named after Chief Sleepy Eye, who was known as a compassionate person with droopy eyelids (or maybe just one). The chief was one of four Sioux Native Americans (four Ojibwe also attended) chosen to meet President James Monroe in 1824 in the nation&#x27;s capital. Later, Sleepy Eye was an integral player in the 1851 signing of the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, which gave all the land but a 10-mile swath on each side of the upper Minnesota River to the U.S. government. His recommendations to traders led to the successful settlement of Mankato, away from flood areas, and the chief eventually settled his people near the lake now known as Sleepy Eye Lake.

Sleepy Eye was platted in 1872 and incorporated as a city in 1903.

<doc id="119592" wikidata="Q859290" url="?curid=119592" title="Cloquet, Minnesota">
<text>Cloquet ( ) is a city in Carlton County, Minnesota, United States, at the junction of Interstate 35 and Minnesota State Highway 33. Part of the city lies within the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation and serves as one of the reservation&#x27;s three administrative centers. The population was 12,568 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Cloquet began as a group of small settlements around three sawmills: Shaw Town, Nelson Town, and Johnson Town. These became known as Knife Falls after a local waterfall over sharp slate rocks, and later as Cloquet. The Ojibwe in the area called the area , meaning &#x27;At the Knife Portage&#x27;, as the portage to avoid Knife Falls connected the three communities. The area was platted in 1883 and the village of Cloquet was incorporated from the three settlements in 1884. It became a city with a mayor and city council in 1904. The word &quot;Cloquet&quot; first appeared on an 1843 map of the area by Joseph N. Nicollet, which named the Cloquet River, a tributary of the Saint Louis River, and the Cloquet Rapids to the north. &quot;Cloquet&quot; is a French surname, but historians have found no source for it. Some speculate that the river was named for the 19th-century French scientists Hippolyte and Jules Cloquet, and the settlement named for the river.

The area was the site of the 1918 Cloquet fire, which destroyed much of the town and killed 453 people.

Before and after World War II Cloquet was home of the nation&#x27;s strongest consumers&#x27; cooperatives. The Cloquet Cooperative Society (founded in 1910) operated two cooperative stores, which handled food, hardware, shoes, dry goods, and furniture. Other cooperative services included a building supply store, a coal yard, a mortuary, an auto repair shop and a gas service station.

In 1939, the co-op did 35% of the business in the town, and 18% in Carlton County. By the mid-1950s, the consumer society had a membership of 4,262 out of a population of 8,500. This was a national record, given that the total business of all American co-ops combined represented only 0.5% of the economy. The Finnish cooperative groups of the area also had an influence on the American cooperative movement in general.

In the 1970s the area of the city was increased to over ten times what it had been in 1970. Despite this, the population of the city still declined from 1970 to 1980, even as the number of separate residences increased.

Cloquet is home to the R.W. Lindholm Service Station, the only filling station designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright and a structure now on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="119596" wikidata="Q1974440" url="?curid=119596" title="Elimination communication">
<text>Elimination communication (EC) is a practice in which a caregiver uses timing, signals, cues, and intuition to address an infant&#x27;s need to eliminate waste. Caregivers try to recognize and respond to babies&#x27; bodily needs and enable them to urinate and defecate in an appropriate place (e.g. a toilet). Caregivers may use diapers (nappies) as a back-up in case of &quot;misses&quot; some or all of the time, or not at all. EC emphasizes communication between the caregiver and child, helping them both become more attuned to the child&#x27;s innate rhythms and control of urination and defecation. The term &quot;elimination communication&quot; was inspired by traditional practices of diaperless baby care in less industrialized countries and hunter-gatherer cultures. Some practitioners of EC begin soon after birth, the optimum window being zero to four months in terms of helping the baby get in tune with their elimination needs, although it can be started with babies of any age. The practice can be done full-time, part-time, or just occasionally.

In the UK, baby-led potty training is a similar system for meeting babies&#x27; toileting needs. The main feature of the system is that care-givers &#x27;hold babies out&#x27; or support them on a potty in order for them to void in an appropriate place outside their nappy. The method is typically started before the baby is six months old. Care-givers use a combination of timing, and observing babies&#x27; own signals, to decide when to hold them out. Some parents use the technique just occasionally, others as an alternative to full-time nappies, and some as a route to toilet independence.

== Origins ==
Keeping babies clean and dry without diapers is standard practice in many cultures throughout the world. While this practice is only recently becoming known in industrialized societies, it remains the dominant method of baby hygiene in non-industrialized ones.

The terms &quot;elimination communication&quot; and &quot;natural infant hygiene&quot; were coined by Ingrid Bauer and are used interchangeably in her book, &quot;Diaper Free! The Gentle Wisdom of Natural Infant Hygiene&quot; (2001). Bauer had traveled to India and Africa, where she noticed that while most mothers carried their diaperless babies constantly, she saw no elimination &quot;accidents&quot; as would be expected in industrialized countries where babies wear diapers almost continuously from birth. Subsequently, she raised her own children with minimal use of diapers, and eventually began to share her approach with other mothers and caregivers—initially through Internet-based parenting support groups and eventually through her book and website.

Prior publications introducing Western parents to this practice include the booklet &quot;Conscious Toilet Training&quot;, by Laurie Boucke (1979), the book &quot;Trickle Treat: Diaperless Infant Toilet Training Method&quot;, by Laurie Boucke (1991), a pamphlet entitled &quot;Elimination Timing&quot;, by Natec (1994), and the more extensive &quot;Infant Potty Training: A Gentle and Primeval Method Adapted to Modern Living&quot;, by Laurie Boucke (2000). Boucke was influenced by an Indian friend who taught her how mothers in India care for babies without diapers, and she adapted the method to fit her Western lifestyle. Boucke later co-produced an in-depth DVD entitled &quot;Potty Whispering: The Gentle Practice of Infant Potty Training&quot; (2006) and co-authored articles for medical journals.

While the terms &quot;elimination communication&quot; and &quot;infant potty training&quot; have become synonymous, many caregivers who practice EC do not consider it to be a form of &quot;training&quot;, &quot;per se&quot;. &quot;Nappyless technique&quot; is a term some mothers in the UK prefer to describe babies who use a potty. EC is viewed primarily as a way to meet the baby&#x27;s present needs and to enhance attachment and communication in general. In that sense, EC is often likened to breastfeeding. &quot;Toilet mastery is, of course, an inevitable consequence&quot;, writes Bauer, &quot;Yet it&#x27;s no more the goal of Natural Infant Hygiene than weaning is the goal of breastfeeding&quot; (2001, p. 217).

Today, one often hears the terms &quot;natural infant hygiene&quot;, &quot;infant potty training&quot;, &quot;nappy-free&quot;, &quot;infant pottying&quot; and &quot;elimination communication&quot; used synonymously.

The method of holding a baby out to trigger the reflex to urinate and defecate has presumably been used by mothers since the first &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. The English doctor Pye Henry Chavasse suggested in his 1839 book &quot;Advice to a Mother on the Management of her Children&quot;, that the baby should be held out over a pot at least a dozen times a day at 3 months old; if this were done, there need be no more nappies at 4 months. In 1912 Edward Mansfield Brockbank advised that babies should be supported on the pot from two months old.
The practise was commonplace up until the fifties, when Dr Spock&#x27;s method of delaying the start of toilet training until 18 months became popular. This, coupled with the advent of disposable nappies meant that the practise of BLPT diminished. Although some mothers still used the method, learning about it either by accident or intuition, or from knowledge passed on by grandparents, the method dropped out of common usage. From the nineties until the present, official UK health advice suggests that it is counter-productive to start toilet training before 18 months, and the standard advice is to wait until children showed signs of &quot;readiness&quot; (but not before 18 – 24 months of age). Amongst some health professionals there is a received wisdom that babies have no bladder or bowel control under two years.

== Benefits ==
According to &quot;The Diaper-Free Baby&quot; by Christine Gross-Loh, EC offers a wide range of advantages. Because EC lessens families&#x27; reliance on diapers, this helps reduce the environmental impact of discarding disposable diapers and/or washing cloth diapers, and saves families hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in disposable diapers. EC babies are free from the problems of conventional diapering such as diaper rash, diaper change battles, not being able to explore diapered parts of their bodies, vulnerability to urinary tract infections, and potentially delayed or difficult potty training. Gross-Loh also reports that EC promotes a unique and wonderful bond between babies and caregivers.

Parents report that the squat or &quot;potty&quot; position that they tend to use to hold their baby in order to go is very comfortable for the baby. The position aligns the digestive tract and supports relaxation, as well as contraction of the pelvic floor muscles, helping babies to release their urine or stool and simultaneously build control of the urinary and anal sphincter muscles. This especially helps babies who are suffering from mild constipation. Many babies find defecating to be an unsettling process, especially as they transition to solid food. With EC, parents hold their infant in a supportive position as they defecate into the toilet or a suitable receptacle, offering loving emotional and physical support during this process.

Parents report benefits in three areas: for baby, parents and the environment. These are some of the main advantages:

For baby:
reduces incidence of nappy rash; more comfortable; encourages communication; helps relieve constipation and wind.

For parents:
cheaper; less washing; more hygienic; fewer leaking nappies; more confidence; greater bond with baby; another tool to soothe a crying baby.

For the environment:
reduces number of soiled and wet nappies sent to landfill; less washing of cloth nappies; solid waste treated via sewerage instead of going to landfill where it releases methane.

== Criticisms ==
Conventional potty training advice is based on late 1990s research by Thomas Berry Brazelton, who introduced the &quot;readiness approach&quot;. He writes that &quot;widespread acceptance of readiness and independent toileting have since been supported by clinical experience and resulted in agreement that a child should be ready to participate in toilet training at approximately 18 months of age and be trained completely by 2 or 3 years old.&quot; He argues that trying to toilet train before this age could be coercive and therefore psychologically damaging. Brazelton acknowledges that elimination communication is both possible and desirable, but he believes it is difficult to perform in Western society. In particular he cites a mother&#x27;s return to work as an obstacle to elimination communication. He also argues that parents should not be made to feel guilty if they cannot communicate with their babies in this way. His neutrality on the subject has been questioned since he has worked as a consultant for Procter &amp; Gamble, manufacturer of Pampers diapers, including appearing in a Pampers commercial.

== Components ==
The main components of EC are timing, signals, cueing, and intuition.

=== Timing ===
Timing refers to identifying the infant&#x27;s natural timing of elimination. Newborns tend to urinate every 10–20 minutes, sometimes very regularly, which makes timing extremely useful. Older babies may still be very regular, or may vary in timing based on when they have last eaten or slept. As infants get older, the time between eliminations will increase. By six months, it is not uncommon for babies to go an hour or more without urinating while awake (babies, like adults, rarely urinate during a deep sleep). Timing varies radically for defecation, as some infants may have several bowel movements a day, while others may only have one every few days. Parents report that some babies as young as three months will appear to hold all their bowel movements until they are held in a particular squat position, as long as this is offered regularly enough. Parents also offer the potty at various times according to routine, e.g. after a feed, after waking, just before bath or bed. In the West, infant potty training historically relied on timing as the main method of training.

=== Signals ===
Signals are the baby&#x27;s way of informing a caregiver of an elimination need. Some babies signal very clearly from the beginning, while others may have very subtle signals, or no signal at all. These signals vary widely from one infant to another. Examples include a certain facial expression, a particular cry, squirming, or a sudden unexplained fussiness, among others. Signals are most effectively observed if the baby is left without diapers for the first couple of weeks of starting elimination communication. Babies who are nursing will often start unlatching and relatching repeatedly as they feed when they need to eliminate. For defecation, many babies may grunt or pass gas as a signal. As babies get older their signals become more conscious and babies often point to, or look at, a caregiver or potty to indicate need. Older babies can learn a gesture or baby sign for &quot;potty&quot;. Later they may learn a word as part of their early acquisition of language.

=== Cueing ===
Cueing consists of the caregiver making a particular sound or other cue when they provide the baby with an opportunity to eliminate. At first, the caregiver can make the cueing sound when the baby is eliminating to develop an association between the sound and the action. Once the association is established, the cue can be used to indicate to the baby that he or she is in an appropriate potty place. This is especially useful for infants who may not recognize public toilets or unfamiliar receptacles as a &quot;potty&quot;. Common sound cues include &quot;psss psss&quot; for urination and &quot;hmm hmm&quot; (grunting) for defecation. Older babies (late starters) may respond better to more word-like cues. Cues do not have to be auditory; the act of sitting on the potty itself or being held in position can serve as a cue, or the sign language sign for &quot;toilet&quot; can be a cue. The American Sign Language sign for &quot;toilet&quot; involves forming a hand into the letter &quot;T&quot; (a fist with the thumb inserted between the first and middle fingers) and shaking the hand side to side from the wrist.

=== Intuition ===
Intuition refers to a caregiver&#x27;s unprompted thought that the baby may need to eliminate. Although much intuition may simply be subconscious awareness of timing or signals, many parents who practice EC find it an extremely reliable component.

== Baby-led potty training method ==
Babies are born with a primitive reflex which causes them to empty their bladder when parents remove the nappy and hold them in a squat position. By holding their baby out regularly, parents capitalise on this reflex. They encourage the baby to go in this position, and soon the baby is conditioned to try to void when in this hold. Parents then offer the baby opportunities to go throughout the day. They can offer based on timing—either at convenient times for the parents, on a routine, or through learning what times the baby is likely to need to pass waste. They can also look out for signs that the baby is uncomfortable with a full bladder or bowel.
Once the baby has become accustomed to passing waste when held or on the potty, parents are able to adapt the method to suit their lifestyle. They can offer the potty just occasionally to help relieve an unsettled baby, or they can offer regularly throughout the day in order to drastically reduce the reliance on nappies.
When continued through to the baby&#x27;s second year, the method is adapted to help them transition to complete toilet independence.

<text>Carver is a small city in Carver County, Minnesota, United States along the banks of the Minnesota River. The city is named after early explorer Jonathan Carver. The downtown area is home to the Carver Historic District, a nationally recognized collection of historically significant local buildings.

The population was 3,724 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

U.S. Highway 212 serves as a main route in the area.

==History==

===Early history===
Ten thousand years ago, the Glacial River Warren flowed through the area and left deposits of clay, sand, gravel, and fine silt soils as well as the Minnesota River. Carver and the surrounding Minnesota River Valley were occupied by a Native American, pre-Columbian Woodland Culture from approximately 1200 B.C. to A.D. 1850. In 1834, there was a Wahpeton village at the present-day location of Carver, led by Chief Mazomaini; early maps indicate it was located on either side of the mouth of Carver Creek where it meets the Minnesota River.

Pierre-Charles Le Sueur became the first European to navigate the Minnesota River, and between 1683 and 1700 made explorations of the region on behalf of King Louis XIV of France. In 1766, Jonathan Carver explored the area on behalf of the British Empire, and made maps as he searched for a western water route that flowed across North America to the Pacific Ocean. He named a small branch flowing into the Minnesota River &quot;Carver&#x27;s River&quot;, strongly correlated to the Carver Creek of today. In 1805, French trader Jean-Baptiste Faribault established the Little Rapids trading post just upriver of present-day Carver; the post, on behalf of the Northwest Fur Company, was visited by Voyageurs, Coureur des bois, Dakota Indians, and Christian missionaries.

===Boomtown===
The 1851 Treaty of Traverse de Sioux, signed between the Dakota and the U.S. Government, legally opened the area to white settlers. Before the Treaty was fully ratified, Axel Jorgenson, an immigrant from Fredrikshald, Norway, settled in the area by 1852 as a sooner. Jorgenson laid claim to that would become Carver. He called the area Lukenborg (or Luksenborg), but called it Fulton. In order to augment his barge transport business, to and from St. Paul, he opened a cheap hotel, the Hotel Luksenborg.
A land boom in the 1850s led to widespread speculation along key river locations. Carver&#x27;s position between navigable sections of the Minnesota River, as well as Carver and Spring Creeks, was an ideal location for a steamboat and barge terminal for transferring cargo. In 1854, Jorgenson sold his claim to the Carver Land Company, a group of seven speculators, who planned to plat and develop a town. Among the investors were Alexander Ramsey, the former Territorial Governor, and Levi Griffin, the first sheriff of Carver County. Ramsey was responsible for naming the town Carver. The Town of Carver was platted in 1857 and lots were divided up among the seven according to their investment.

By 1855, Carver already had a tailor, a hotel, a boarding house, a building designer, a carpenter, a livery stable, a blacksmith, two shoemakers, and a general store. When the town was platted in 1857, it already had 35 buildings; the school district was established the same year and was known as Minnesota School District #1 for a century. Also during this period, the steamboat &quot;The Antelope&quot; was making daily round trips between Carver and St. Paul, a one-way river run of . Steamboats brought passengers and immigrants, who rapidly opened up the surrounding area to settlement by farmers who could buy land from the U. S. government for $1.25 an acre, as well as the supplies needed to grow these settlements.

The Panic of 1857 caused many frontier settlements to collapse. One such community, Louisville, located directly across the Minnesota River in present-day Louisville Township, collapsed and many of its buildings were moved to Carver. In 1858 Carver had a small gold rush when gold was purportedly found in Spring Creek. By 1860, immigrants who had previously come from the Eastern U.S. were supplanted by those from Sweden and Germany.

The Dakota War of 1862 erupted in the region as most of the regions soldiers were embroiled in the concurrent American Civil War. Between 400 and 500 pioneers in southern and western Minnesota were killed as war parties attacked settlements throughout the region. Many settlers sought refuge in Carver due to town&#x27;s steamboat transportation, which offered evacuation to Fort Snelling, if needed. The town was spared, but rumors of its attack caused residents of Shakopee to flee to Fort Snelling.

===Decline===
The arrival of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway in 1871 marked the decline of Carver&#x27;s importance, as cargo and passenger traffic quickly shifted to the new mode of transportation. Telegraph service quickly followed. In 1877, Carver incorporated as a village. Northwestern Bell connected the town with phone service to the Twin Cities in 1893.

Carver businesses suffered during the twin events of Prohibition and the Great Depression, causing the city to go into several decades of economic stagnation, leading to the decay of many historic houses and commercial buildings. The April 1965 flood of the Upper Mississippi River affected the lower part of old Carver and deepened the depression. The Flood Control Act of 1965 led to the creation of a floodwall to keep the Minnesota River at bay.

===Restoration===

On June 25, 1969, Carver-on-the-Minnesota, a non-profit historic preservation organization formed to purchase, renovate and save key properties. While some progress was made during the 1960s-70s, the deaths of founding members caused the organization to stall and several important buildings were lost. The Carver Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, making it one of the first historic districts in Minnesota. The years of decline had actually helped preserve a number of important historic structures from ever being redeveloped, and the historic district includes eighty-seven buildings and four structures of commercial, religious, residential and social importance.

The City of Carver created the Heritage Preservation Commission in 1989 as a supporting group of appointees to aid the City Council and Planning Commission on historic preservation issues. In 2006, Carver attained Certified Local Government status by the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office. In summer 2007, the White House named Carver a Preserve America Community.

Later, the Dakota (commonly known as the Sioux) were the primary nation in this region known as the Big Woods. Although the Indian mounds located in Chaska City Square indicate the immediate area was inhabited years before 1769, the year Chaska&#x27;s recorded history began.

In 1776, Jonathan Carver explored the lands along the Minnesota River and chronicled his journeys. French Canadian fur traders traveled the waterways, trading with the Dakota in the early 19th century. During this time, Jean-Baptiste Faribault established a trading post in Chaska.

In 1851, the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux officially opened Little Rapids, as Chaska was then known, to settlement. Soon after, speculators moved into the new territory. Among the earliest was Thomas Andrew Holmes who, in August 1851, claimed a clearing as the Chaska townsite.

The name &quot;Chaska&quot; is derived from a Dakota word often given as a name to the first born male child. Records show that David L. Fuller purchased the &quot;Shaska&quot; townsite from Holmes in 1852. In 1857, the townsite was platted by the Shaska Company. In the same year, construction began on the original Carver County Courthouse located where the post office and KleinBank now stand in downtown Chaska. Chaska was incorporated as a village in 1871 and, by special legislative charter, as a city in 1891.

An abundance of high quality clay led to the start of brick making in 1857. By the 1880s, as a result of the clay resources, Chaska was a thriving brick manufacturing center. Bricks were shipped by boat to Saint Paul and, although the city grew as a result of steamboat trade, it was not until the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway was built through town in 1873 that rapid expansion began.

With the advent of the 20th century came other industries, including the processing of beet sugar and other agricultural products; flour making, butter making, the canning of peas, corn, and tomatoes, and the curing of sauerkraut and pickles.

National polls named Chaska the eighth-best city in the United States in 2007 and 20th best in 2009.

In September 2016, Chaska hosted the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National Golf Course, and in March 2018, the PGA of America, with help from the U.S. Curling team, announced Hazeltine would be the first American venue to host a second Ryder Cup in 2028.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The downtown portion of Chaska lies on the Minnesota River.

Chaska Boulevard (Old Highway 212), Pioneer Trail, U.S. Highway 212, and Minnesota State Highway 41 are four of the main routes in Chaska.

==Demographics==

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Chaska&#x27;s population averaged about 2,000 and the nature of the city remained unchanged. The city retained its small-town image until the 1950s when the transition to a metropolitan community began. The expansion of the seven-county metropolitan area reached Chaska in the 1960s. With that expansion came the introduction of the Jonathan New Town design concept in 1966. The Jonathan &quot;new town&quot; development within Chaska brought new land, new jobs and new people to the community.

This period of transition and expansion continues today. Dozens of modern industries have located to Chaska and continue to do so; residential construction adds 300 to 400 new homes per year; commercial business continues to expand offering a variety of retail and service opportunities to its residents; redevelopment of commercial areas in the downtown began in the 1980s and still continues. Although the community has seen much growth, development regulations and sound planning have ensured Chaska&#x27;s small sense of community and the preservation of its rich heritage.

In early 2005, the city of Chaska annexed the remaining portion of Chaska Township. Current plans for the area include a residential &quot;smart growth&quot;-styled development.

A new spike in the population occurred after the construction of the Highway 212 freeway passing through the heart of Chaska, serving as a fast, direct, link to the heart of the Twin Cities. This freeway includes a bus rapid transit route serving Chaska with fast, efficient mass transit, along with convenient access to the Light Rail system which connects the southwest suburbs to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul.

As of 2000, the median income for a household in the city was $60,325, and the median income for a family was $69,612. Males had a median income of $45,401 versus $32,312 for females. The per capita income for the city was $25,368. About 3.4% of families and 4.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.9% of those under age 18 and 6.4% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
Starting in 2004, the city government offered low-cost, high-speed wireless internet service for residents, businesses, and government entities throughout the community through a service called Chaska.net, but the program was canceled, after more than 10 years, in 2015 due to a decreasing customer base and large costs to upgrade equipment. Chaska is the home of numerous industrial and manufacturing concerns. Among them are TPI Specialties, Update Ltd, Wigen Water Technologies, Beckman Coulter and Hartman Homes.

Over the years, Chaska has also been the birthplace of several well known products and companies, including Softsoap, NordicTrack, and Heartland America. One such company, My Pillow, has received significant media coverage for multiple lawsuits as well as controversial issues focusing on its founder, Mike Lindell.

Opening in December 2015, the Chaska Curling Center has exceeded expectations as becoming a landmark in the city. The Center has helped with not only expanding Chaska community engagement and positively impacting downtown businesses, but also bringing the city national and international recognition as well as tourism. In 2016, to commemorate the start of the international Ryder Cup tournament, hosted in Chaska, the Norwegian and American Olympic teams squared off for an International Bonspiel, again bringing international eyes to the community. In 2018, the Chaska Curling Center was named a USA Curling National Training Center for the United States Curling Association, which means the Curling Center is able to host national events with USA Curling, and the USA Curling High Performance Program and Development Program can use the Chaska Curling Center for practices, camps, and events.

==Popular culture==

Chaska was also featured in the film &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;. The scene in the furniture store takes place at the old Schniedermen&#x27;s Furniture store in downtown Chaska. The building has since become a fitness center and was razed in 2018 to make way for a small strip mall.

Hank Snow refers to Chaska in his popular song &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere&quot; as a place he has visited.

Cheryl Strayed briefly lived in Chaska during her early life, and mentions so in her popular book &quot;&quot;.

On April 10, 1906, the village council passed a motion to rent four lots owned by the village called Thomas Slough, to be used for ball purposes. Council support of the game continued in 1914.

The Mayer Baseball Club was organized in the Depression years of the early 1930s. In 1934, the city council, with the encouragement of the community, purchased three-plus acres of land from the Haueters. This land was located between Zion Lutheran School, and the Mayer Public School buildings. The Mayer Baseball team started league play in 1935.

Since 1943, the Mayer Blazers have made seven state tournament appearances. In 1945, Mayer took home second place honors in the Class A state tournament. Their strongest state tournament showing came in 1973, when they finished third.

In 1976, Clarence Guetzkow was elected to the Minnesota Amateur Baseball Hall of Fame in recognition of his tireless allegiance to Mayer Baseball, the Crow River Valley League, and Minnesota Amateur Baseball as a whole.

<text>Cass Lake is a city in Cass County, Minnesota, United States, located within the boundaries of the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. It is surrounded by Pike Bay Township. Cass Lake had a population of 675 in the 2020 census. It is notable as the headquarters location of Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, as well as the Chippewa National Forest.

The city is located on the shore of its namesake Cass Lake, which was named in honor of Michigan Governor Lewis Cass.

Cass Lake is part of the Brainerd Micropolitan Statistical Area. It reached its peak of population of over 2,100 in 1920. Since 1950, the combination of decline of small town retailers, suburbanization, and decreased employment in forest industries have resulted in steadily decreasing population.

==Economy==
Forest products have historically been an important part of the local economy. The Glenmont Lumber Company opened a sawmill in the autumn of 1898, followed by Scanlon-Gipson Lumber Company opening a planing mill in the summer of 1899. Both operated until the sawmill burnt in 1902. The Julius Neils Lumber Company opened a 30 mft sawmill, planing mill, and 8 mft lath mill in May 1900, operating until 1923. The Northern Pine Crating Co. opened a wooden box factory in the autumn of 1907, operating until the mill burned c.1950.

Wheeler Lumber Bridge and Supply Co. opened a post-peeling plant in 1949, followed by a wood-treating plant in 1951. This facility was expanded in 1959 and 1971. Wheeler was purchased by St. Regis Paper Company in 1968; St. Regis later purchased a sawmill as well Frank&#x27;s Mill (opened 1939). After the purchase of St. Regis by Champion International in 1985, the corporation closed the facility. The sawmill was purchased by Cass Forest Products and continues to operate (as of 2010).

Tourism has been an increasingly important component of the local economy since the earliest days of the community. Numerous resorts and campgrounds in the area cater to sport fishing, hunting, camping, and watersports. Due to the cold winters, tourism is highly seasonal.

The Federal Government has been an important local employer since 1902, when the Minnesota Forest Reserve was established. Cass Lake was selected as the location of the Forest Supervisor&#x27;s Office. Following passage of the Emergency Conservation Work Act of 1933 and establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps, Cass Lake was the headquarters for the Chippewa Sub-District, responsible for management of over a dozen camps. Among the CCC projects completed in Cass Lake were the monumental log-construction Forest Supervisor&#x27;s Office (1936) and establishment of the Lydick Nursery (1934), which produced millions of seedlings for reforestation work.

In 1922, the Bureau of Indian Affairs established the Consolidated Chippewa Agency to serve all the Ojibwe tribes in Minnesota, with the exception of Red Lake. It selected Cass Lake as its headquarters. Later, the Indian Health Service opened a hospital and clinic (1937) to serve the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.

Following passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and establishment of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, tribal headquarters were located in Cass Lake. Cass Lake is also location of the headquarters of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, which operates the Cedar Lakes Casino.

There are a variety of small businesses that keep the Cass Lake economy thriving.

==Education==
Cass Lake is located in Independent School District 115 (Cass Lake-Bena School District). Cass Lake–Bena Elementary School is located within the city limits, while Cass Lake–Bena High School and Middle School are located approximately one mile south of town. Elementary school classes began in 1899 and the high school opened in 1904.

Students also attend the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig School in an area near Bena, a Bureau of Indian Affairs-funded elementary and secondary school established in 1975.

Leech Lake Tribal College, a two-year tribal college, is located approximately northwest of town.

==History==
The area was inhabited for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples. In historic times, the Ojibwe/Chippewa moved west and south from the Great Lakes region, settling across present-day Minnesota.

The village was established in 1898 with the construction of the Great North Railway. The post office was originally established as &#x27;Tuller&#x27; in December 1898, named after the brother-in-law of the first postmaster. When this was known, residents quickly lodged protests with the Postmaster General and by the end of March 1899, it was renamed &#x27;Cass Lake&#x27;.

The forest industry has historically supplied many jobs, but has been susceptible to boom-and-bust cycle. Between 1898 and 1923, the city was dependent on lumber mills utilizing pine from the surrounding forests. Depletion of the pine resource was followed by utilization of lower value species at a box factory which operated until 1950, and a wood treatment plant operated by Wheeler Lumber between 1949 and 1985. From 1983 until 2009, Potlatch Corporation and its successor Ainsworth operated an oriented strand board plant in nearby Farden Township, which provided employment to many residents. Cass Forest Products, an employee-owned company, operates a sawmill that has been in operation since 1939, and is one of the largest forest product producers in Minnesota. The former wood-treating plant operated by Wheeler Lumber within the city limits has been designated a Federal Superfund site, due to soil and groundwater contamination by the wood treating compounds creosote, pentachlorophenol, and ammoniacal copper arsenate.

From 1911-1919, the Cass Lake Boarding School, a Native American residential school, operated in Cass Lake. The school opened with the capacity for 50 students.

In 2003, Elaine Fleming was the first Native American to be elected as mayor of the town.

==Geography and climate==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

<doc id="119670" wikidata="Q2230382" url="?curid=119670" title="Longville, Minnesota">
<text>Longville is a city in Cass County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 153 at the 2020 census. The city was named after its founder, Jim Long. It is roughly four hours north of the Twin Cities. It is part of the Brainerd Micropolitan Statistical Area. Minnesota State Highway 84 serves as a main route in the community, and Minnesota State Highway 200 is nearby. Longville is home to Longville Municipal Airport.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Longville is part of the Northern Minnesota&#x27;s glacial plain, which was flattened by glaciers during the most recent glacial advance. During the last glacial period, massive ice sheets at least thick ravaged the state&#x27;s landscape and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. Since the landscape is going through post-glacial rebound, it is poorly drained, creating Cass County&#x27;s numerous lakes and rivers.

Longville&#x27;s cultural landscape and its surrounding lands can be characterized as seasonal and recreational. The bulk of human activity occurs in the summer when the cabin owners vacation at their lake homes, and the activities they engage in are mostly recreational.

===Notable lakes===

Long Lake lies immediately north of town. It is very deep, up to , and drops off rather quickly from shore. This is very unusual for lakes of this size in the region. They are normally no more than deep.

Girl Lake lies to the west, part of the Woman Lake Chain.

==History==

The area was inhabited for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of Indians. Before European settlement, the Ojibwe moved into the area from the Great Lakes, pushing out the historic Dakota peoples, such as the Assiniboine and Hidatsa. European American settlers followed the early fur traders and trappers, and encroached on Native American territories.

Longville started around 1906 as a logging town in what is now Cass County. Fishing was very popular in early Longville and is still prevalent today. Tourism later grew as a service industry. In the 20th century, people from urban areas came to more rural areas for recreation associated with lakes, fishing, hunting and water sports. All the roads in and around Longville were dirt until the 1920s. Much of the downtown was rebuilt during the mid-20th century. Many of the cabins in the surrounding landscape were built in the late 1960s and 1970s. By the 1980s the Longville area was almost fully developed. The town has changed little since 1990.
