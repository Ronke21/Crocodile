<text>Little Silver is a borough in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 6,131, an increase of 181 (+3.0%) from the 2010 census count of 5,950, which in turn reflected a drop of 220 (−3.6%) from the 6,170 counted in the 2000 census.

Little Silver was established with a King&#x27;s land grant in 1663 and settled in 1667. Little Silver was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 19, 1923, from portions of Shrewsbury Township, based on the results of a referendum held on April 28, 1923.

==History==
Prior to the settlement of Europeans, the area that is now Little Silver was inhabited by the Navesink Native Americans.

There are several tales of how Little Silver received its name. In one, brothers Joseph and Peter Parker, who settled in this area in 1667 and owned land bounded by Parker&#x27;s Creek on the south and Little Silver Creek on the north, named their holdings &quot;Little Silver&quot; after their father&#x27;s (George Parker) estate in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. The original Parker Homestead, dating to 1725 and one of the state&#x27;s oldest, was acquired by the borough and is undergoing renovation.

Other explanations for the derivation of the name are the payment to Native Americans for purchase of the land and the placid appearance of the water.

The borough&#x27;s earliest European residents were primarily farmers, fishermen and merchants.

Early families included:
* Parkers – Joseph and Peter Parker originally settled the area, and their original homestead at 235 Rumson Road has been declared a state historic site.
* Sickles – Harold and Elsie Sickles acquired land and opened a wholesale truck farm in 1908. The land was acquired from Harold&#x27;s mother who was related to the Parkers. Transitioning from seasonal to year-round in 1998, Sickles Market became a specialty garden and food market until it closed in March 2024 after 116 years.
* Lovett – John T. Lovett owned a nursery that once covered almost half the borough, supplying large catalog houses such as Sears Roebuck, Macy&#x27;s and Newberry&#x27;s. In 1878 he circulated a petition to the community recommending that the name be revised and on July 30, 1879, the Post Office name was changed from &quot;Parkersville&quot; to &quot;Little Silver&quot;.

The borough has had a varied history as a resort, agricultural area and fishing town. Today, the municipality is primarily residential with a range of housing types, from ranches and capes.

Little Silver separated from Shrewsbury Township in 1923. Since then, farms and nurseries have been replaced by housing. Over the years, New York City and North Jersey commuters have made Little Silver their home, traveling by rail or auto to their jobs. The Little Silver train station on Sycamore Avenue was designed by the noted American architect Henry Hobson Richardson and built in 1890. It reopened after renovations in 2003.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 3.32 square miles (8.60 km2), including 2.71 square miles (7.02 km2) of land and 0.61 square miles (1.57 km2) of water (18.28%).

The original farms and nurseries have almost all been replaced by housing today. Little Silver&#x27;s location on the Shrewsbury River makes it a popular destination for boaters and water sports enthusiasts, with a public boat ramp at the Dominick F. Santelle Park off Riverview Avenue. Approximately 8% of the homes are directly on the Shrewsbury River and another third of homes are on streams that connect to it.

The borough borders the Monmouth County boroughs of Fair Haven, Monmouth Beach, Oceanport, Red Bank, Rumson and Shrewsbury.

Little Silver Point is an unincorporated community located within Little Silver.

The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Little Silver is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Little Silver is Republican Robert C. Neff Jr., whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Borough Council are Kevin J. Brennan (R, 2026), Christopher M. Faherty (R, 2026), Donald S. Galante (R, 2025), Elizabeth Giblin (R, 2025; appointed to serve an unexpired term), Christian M. Smith (R, 2027) and Laurette Villardi (R, 2027).

Giblin will serve on an interim basis until the November 2025 general election, when a candidate will be chosen to serve the remainder of the term of office.

In March 2016, the borough council selected Corinne Thygeson from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by Stuart W. Van Winkle that became vacant upon his resignation; Thygeson will serve on an interim basis until the November 2016 general election, when voters will select a candidate to fill the balance of the term.

In January 2015, the borough council selected Glenn Talavera to fill the vacant seat expiring December 2015 of Richard J. &quot;Rick&quot; Scott, who resigned from office as work obligations will have him out of the borough.

In September 2011, following the death of mayor Suzanne Castleman in July 2011, Robert Neff was appointed to fill the vacant mayoral seat, while Donald Galante, a former member of the borough council, was appointed to fill Neff&#x27;s vacant council seat.

<doc id="125480" wikidata="Q2747128" url="?curid=125480" title="Loch Arbour, New Jersey">
<text>Loch Arbour is a village situated on the Jersey Shore in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the village&#x27;s population was 224, an increase of 30 (+15.5%) from the 2010 census count of 194, which had in turn reflected a decline of 86 (−30.7%) from the 280 recorded at the 2000 census.

In 2020, Loch Arbour was the third-smallest municipality in New Jersey in terms of area (behind Shrewsbury Township and East Newark) and was the fifth-smallest municipality by population in the state of New Jersey.

==History==
Loch Arbour was incorporated as a village by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 23, 1957, from portions of Ocean Township, based on the results of a referendum held that same day. The borough was named after Lochaber, Scotland.

Its formation was driven by efforts to build beachfront condominiums in the area. Residents who sought to prevent the development led the secession, taking with them the last portion of oceanfront property in what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;the now ironically-named Ocean Township.&quot;

In 1997, Loch Arbour voters rejected a ballot proposal that would have it merge back into Ocean Township by an 88–69 margin, and proposals to merge with Allenhurst or Interlaken failed by a nearly 10–1 margin.

A ballot proposal in 2011 again considered a merger with Allenhurst, citing a potential reduction in property taxes for residents. In 2012, Loch Arbour officials held discussions with their counterparts in Allenhurst towards a plan in which the two municipalities would merge, subject to approval by the councils of both communities and approval of a referendum by voters in both Loch Arbour and Allenhurst. The merger drive was driven by property taxes paid to the Ocean Township School District, a relationship that would be ended by the merger, under which the combined municipality would send students at lower cost to the Asbury Park Public Schools.

While there are four municipalities that retain the Village type of government (Loch Arbour, Ridgefield Park, Ridgewood and South Orange), none of them still use the Village form of government. Loch Arbour was the last to do so, but on December 20, 2011, its residents voted to change from having a form with five village trustees to the Walsh Act form of government, under which Loch Arbour is governed by a three-member board of commissioners.

In 1892, James J. Corbett set up his training camp in Loch Arbour for the bout with John L. Sullivan in which Corbett won the world heavyweight boxing championship.

<text>Long Branch is a beachside city in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 31,667, an increase of 948 (+3.1%) from the 2010 census count of 30,719, which in turn reflected a decline of 621 (−2.0%) from the 31,340 counted in the 2000 census. As of the 2020 census, it was the 6th-most-populous municipality in Monmouth County and had the 74th-highest population of any municipality in New Jersey.

Long Branch was formed on April 11, 1867, as the Long Branch Commission, from portions of Ocean Township. Long Branch was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1903, based on the results of a referendum, replacing the Long Branch Commission.

==History==

Long Branch emerged as a beach resort town in the late 18th century, named for its location along a branch of the South Shrewsbury River. In the 19th century, theatrical performers of the day often gathered and performed there. It was visited by many Presidents during the Gilded Age, including Chester A. Arthur, James A. Garfield, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford B. Hayes, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson, along with President Donald Trump in the modern era. Seven Presidents Park, a park near the beach, is named in honor of the visits of the first seven of these presidents. The Church of the Presidents, where these same seven presidents worshiped, is the only structure left in Long Branch associated with them.

President Grant and his family summered at their beachfront cottage in Long Branch the first year of his presidency in 1869 and for most of the rest of Grant&#x27;s life. During this time, Long Branch came to be called the &quot;summer capital&quot;. President James A. Garfield was brought to Long Branch in the hope that the fresh air and quiet might aid his recovery after being shot on July 2, 1881, an incident that left the assassin&#x27;s bullet lodged in his spine. He died here on September 19, 1881, at age 49. The Garfield Tea House, constructed from railroad ties that had been laid to carry Garfield&#x27;s train, is in Elberon.

The famous Long Branch Saloon of the American Old West, located in Dodge City, Kansas, was given its name by its first owner, William Harris, who had moved west from Long Branch, New Jersey, his hometown.

Originally a resort town with a few hotels and large estates and many farms in the early 20th century, Long Branch grew in population. Italian, Irish and Jewish immigrants settled in during this period. During the 1930s, the city used government policies to enforce racial segregation against Blacks at local beaches, assigning all black applicants for beach passes to a single, segregated beach.

By the 1950s, Long Branch like many other towns had developed new residential spots and housing to make room for the growing population. Many of the former farms of Long Branch were transformed into residential suburbs. Many of the estates and a few old historic resorts (with the addition of many new ones) still remain.

In the early 20th century, Long Branch lost much of its activity as a theater spot. In addition, the opening of the Garden State Parkway in the mid-1950s allowed shore visitors to access points further south, which added to Long Branch&#x27;s decline. The civil unrest of the 1960s caused riots in neighboring Asbury Park, and many fled the shore cities for the suburban towns west of the beach. Decades later, the older, more dilapidated parts of the resort town were condemned and redeveloped, in part by using eminent domain legislation.

Long Branch continues to be a popular resort area. Many people from New York City travel or settle into the area to escape the crowded city and enjoy Long Branch&#x27;s beaches.

===Hurricane Sandy===
On October 29, 2012, Long Branch was one of many shore communities that were devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Although Sandy&#x27;s winds were powerful, Long Branch&#x27;s position between Long Beach Island and Sea Bright gave Long Branch a much larger wall of security because it could not be engulfed by surrounding waters. Despite this mainland advantage, there were still several instances of flooding in Long Branch during the storm. Many residents went without electricity for as long as two weeks. The boardwalk was destroyed; the city began rebuilding it in 2015, and it reopened in April 2016, making it the last boardwalk damaged by Sandy to be rebuilt.

==Geography==
Long Branch takes its name from the &quot;long branch&quot; or south branch of the Shrewsbury River.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 6.29 square miles (16.28 km2), including 5.12 square miles (13.27 km2) of land and 1.16 square miles (3.01 km2) of water (18.49%).

The city borders the Monmouth County communities of Deal, Monmouth Beach, Ocean Township, Oceanport and West Long Branch.

===Neighborhoods===
There are several distinct neighborhoods and areas in the City of Long Branch, each with its own character. Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Branchport, East Long Branch, Elberon (served as ZIP Code 07740), Hollywood, Kensington Park, North Long Branch, Pleasure Bay and West End. Other areas include North End (once known as &quot;Atlanticville&quot;), Beachfront North and South (including Pier Village, adjacent to the site of the former Long Branch Pier at the foot of Laird Street), Downtown and Uptown. As the city&#x27;s redevelopment initiatives continue to expand, the lower Broadway area (a portion of the city&#x27;s Downtown) will become an Arts District.

In years past, Long Branch was a major destination for beachgoers, along with Asbury Park, and enjoyed an upscale connotation with tourists. Long Branch is home to Seven Presidents Oceanfront Park, named for the United States presidents who visited the fashionable resort town, including Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, Rutherford Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, Woodrow Wilson and James Garfield.

Long Branch&#x27;s fame as the Nation&#x27;s First Seaside Resort waned in the years following World War II.

==Community==

Due to its location bordering the Atlantic Ocean, the population of Manasquan increases dramatically in the summer months as tourists flock to the beach.

The Manasquan Inlet provides surfers with waves that are corralled, refracted and enlarged by the jetty protruding out into the Atlantic Ocean. The Manasquan Inlet, reopened in 1931, is the northern terminus of the inland portion of the Intracoastal Waterway.

Manasquan has a downtown area with many small businesses. Algonquin Arts Theatre has shows and movies that play throughout the year. It is a historic 540-seat theatre, built in 1938 as a movie house but converted to a professional live performance space in May 1994.

The demolition of traditional beach bungalows and their replacement with much larger single-family dwellings has helped turn Manasquan into a year-round community. The decrease in tourism and rise in residency can be attributed to the decline of once popular tourist destinations. Manasquan no longer has a 24-hour diner or a miniature golf course, and has lost many of the bars once located in its borders. During the summer months, the local bar and party scene overwhelm the area between Brielle Road and Main Street from the bridges to the ocean.

The Firemans&#x27; Fair occurs every July/August. The fair is the largest source of funds for Manasquan Volunteer Engine Company #2 and dates back to 1974. Though it was on a decade-long hiatus until the late 1990s, the five day-long festivities in 2011 were expected to draw 30,000 attendees.

Until 2010, Manasquan was home to the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA), the largest registry of pedigreed cats in the world.

<text>Marlboro Township is a township in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is located within the Raritan Valley region and is a part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 41,502, an increase of 1,311 (+3.3%) from the 2010 census count of 40,191, which in turn reflected an increase of 5,449 (+16.3%) from the 33,423 counted in the 2000 census.

Marlboro Township was formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 17, 1848, from portions of Freehold Township. The township was named for the marl beds found in the area.

==History==

===Historical timeline===

====Lenni Lenape====
The Lenni Lenape Native Americans were the first known organized inhabitants of this area, having settled here about one thousand years ago and forming an agricultural society, occupying small villages that dotted what was to become Marlboro Township. Their villages were known to be in the Wickatunk and Crawford&#x27;s Corner sections of the township.

In 1600, the Delaware / Lenape Native American population in the surrounding area may have numbered as many as 20,000. Several wars, at least 14 separate epidemics (yellow fever, smallpox, influenza, encephalitis lethargica, etc.) and disastrous over-harvesting of the animal populations reduced their population to around 4,000 by the year 1700. Since the Lenape people, like all Native Americans, had no immunity to European diseases, when the populations contacted the epidemics, they frequently proved fatal. Some Lenape starved to death as a result of animal over-harvesting, while others were forced to trade their land for goods such as clothing and food. They were eventually moved to reservations set up by the US Government. They were first moved to the only Indian Reservation in New Jersey, the Brotherton Reservation in Burlington County, New Jersey (1758–1802). Those who remained survived through attempting to adapt to the dominant culture, becoming farmers and tradesmen. As the Lenni Lenape population declined, and the European population increased, the history of the area was increasingly defined by the new European inhabitants and the Lenape Native American tribes played an increasingly secondary role.

====Dutch arrival====

Within a period of 112 years, 1497–1609, four European explorers claimed this land for their sponsors: John Cabot, 1497, for England; Giovanni de Verrazano, 1524, for France; Estevan Gomez, 1525, for Spain, Henry Hudson, 1609, for Holland. After the Dutch arrival to the region in the 1620s, the Lenape were successful in restricting Dutch settlement to Pavonia in present-day Jersey City along the Hudson River until the 1660s and the Swedish settlement to New Sweden (1655 – The Dutch defeat the Swedes on the Delaware). The Dutch established a garrison at Bergen allowing settlement of areas within the province of New Netherland. For 50 years, 1614–1664, the Monmouth County area came under the influence of the Dutch, but it was not settled until after English rule in 1664.

The initial European proprietors of the area purchased the land from the Lenni Lenape leader or Sakamaker. The chief of the Unami, or Turtle clan, was traditionally the great chief of all the Lenni Lenape. One of the sons of the leader, was Weequehela who negotiated the sale of several of the initial tracts of land to the first farmers. An early deed refers to &quot;the chief sachems or leaders of Toponemus.&quot;

On April 2, 1664, the English appointed Richard Nicolls to serve as the Deputy Governor of New York and New Jersey. One year later, April 8, 1665, Nicolls issued &quot;The Monmouth Patent&quot; to twelve men who had come from Western Long Island and New England seeking permanent stability for religious and civil freedom as well as the prospect of improving their estates. Nicolls was unaware that in June, 1664, James had given a lease and release for New Jersey to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, thus invalidating the grant to the Monmouth Patentees. The rule at the time was that land should be purchased from the Patent.

However, in the time between 1685 and the early 18th century, the patent was ignored and land was gradually purchased from the Lenni Lenape causing confusion and disputes over ownership. Following the initial sale of land, the history of the township starts about 1685, when the land was first settled by European farmers from Scotland, England and the Netherlands. The Scottish exiles and early Dutch settlers lived on isolated clearings carved out of the forest. The lingua franca or common language spoken in the area was likely, overwhelmingly Dutch. However, this was one of many languages spoken with the culture very steeped in New Netherlander. The official documentation at the time is frequently found to be in the Dutch language. The documents of the time also suggest that money transactions used the British shilling. The English and Scotch settlers were Quakers. After initial European contact, the Lenape population sharply declined.
The first settlers of the area were led by missionary George Keith. They were Quakers. The Quakers established a town called &quot;Topanemus&quot; and nearby a meetinghouse and a cemetery on what is now Topanemus Road and held the first meeting on October 10, 1702. The first leader of the church was Rev. George Keith who received a large grant of land in the area due to his position as Surveyor-General. Among the first listed communicants of the new church were Garret and Jan Schenck. The church later changed its affiliation to the Episcopal faith and became St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church which is now located in Freehold. The old burial ground still remains on Topanemus Road. In 1692 those of the Presbyterian Faith built a church and burial ground on what is now Gordons Corner Road. The church eventually moved to Tennent where it became known as the Old Tennent Church and played a role in the American Revolutionary War. The old Scots Cemetery still remains at its original site.

====Marl&#x27;s discovery====
The township of Marlboro is named for the prevalence of marl, which was first discovered in the area east of the village in 1768. Marl was used extensively on farms and spread during the winter months to be tilled into the soil in the spring. The &quot;Marl Pits&quot; are clearly reflected on maps from 1889 shown as a dirt road off of Hudson Street heading towards the current location of the township soccer fields. Farmers used marl to improve the soil in the days before commercial fertilizers and there was a heavy demand for it. Marlboro Township&#x27;s first industry was the export of the material, used primarily as fertilizer. In 1853, the Marl was harvested and transported to other parts of the state and to the Keyport docks via the Freehold Marl Company Railroad (now the Henry Hudson Trail). The marl was then sent to New York and other parts of the country via ship. Prior to the finding of Marl, the area was known as &#x27;Bucktown&#x27; for John Buck who owned a tavern in the area.

====Revolutionary War====
Marlboro Township was the scene of a number of skirmishes during the American Revolutionary War, in particular following the Battle of Monmouth in 1778. During the war, the Pleasant Valley section was often raided by the British for food supplies and livestock. The area was referred to as the &quot;Hornet&#x27;s Nest&quot; because of the intensity of attacks on the British by local militia. Beacon Hill (of present-day Beacon Hill Road) was one of three Monmouth County sites where beacons were placed to warn the residents and the Continental forces if the enemy should approach from the bay. There was also considerable activity in the Montrose area of the Township as British troops, retreating from the Battle of Monmouth, tried to wind their way to ships lying off Sandy Hook.

The area was also frequently sacked for food and livestock. The woods and surrounding vegetation were hunted for animals to depletion by the British. One description of a hunt was recorded: &quot;A great deer-drive was organized, taking in almost the entire northern portion of Monmouth county. Before daylight... a line of men... was stretched... somewhere near Marlboro. At an appointed hour this line of beaters, with shot and shout... proceeded forward to drive as large as possible a number of deer to the shore between Port Monmouth and Atlantic Highlands. The drive was completely successful... that deer were almost exterminated in the northerly part of the county.&quot;

====Township formation====

Under the direction and influence of John W. Herbert, Marlboro was established as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 17, 1848, formed from portions of Freehold Township. The township&#x27;s name was originally &quot;Marlborough,&quot; but was subsequently changed to &quot;Marlboro.&quot; It is not known when the name was officially changed, with maps and other documents in the decades after the township&#x27;s establishment referring variously to &quot;Marlboro&quot; or &quot;Marlborough&quot;. The first elected freeholder was John W. Herbert.

By 1873, Marlboro had a post office, school, hotel, multiple stores, churches, and a railroad station of the Freehold and Keyport Railroad. In 1882, the population was 102.

Marlboro was described in 1939 as having &quot;large frame houses comfortably spaced along the highway&quot;.

Marlboro was rural and composed mostly of dairy farms, potato, tomato and other farms laced with small hamlets with modest inns or taverns. Before World War II Marlboro Township was the nation&#x27;s largest grower of potatoes and also known for a large tomato and egg industry. During World War II, egg farms significantly expanded to accommodate military demand.

Following World War II, the state began to significantly build and improve the area transportation infrastructure. As the infrastructure improved, the population started to increase. The 1950s and 1960s saw Marlboro starting to significantly grow. Housing developments started to replace the farm and rural nature as the community expanded. After the early 1970s, Marlboro became a growing suburb for people working in New York City and in large nearby corporations. During the 1980s and early 1990s most of the new housing developments featured four- or five-bedroom houses, but later the trend shifted toward larger estate homes. The building effort became so advanced that Marlboro Township placed restrictions for building around wetlands; called the Stream Corridor Preservation Restrictions to mitigate construction and habitat contamination.

The year 2000 saw continued growth of the housing trend toward larger homes. Towards the end of the decade, housing growth declined due to the Great Recession.

===Historical events===

====Town center====
The Marlboro township center has historically been considered an area around the intersection of Main Street (Route 79) and School Road. In the late 19th century the intersection held two hotels (both of them are now gone), general store (was on the lot of the current fire department building), and Post Office (was on the lot of a current Chinese Restaurant). Behind the current small mini-mart on the corner of this intersection, you can still see one of the original barns from the early 19th century. However, Marlboro no longer has any official town center and can be considered an example of suburban sprawl. Efforts are underway to create an official &quot;Village Center&quot; and multiple proposals have come forward in recent discussions. Current vision statements suggest the creation of a pedestrian-friendly, mixed use Village Center, with an emphasis on walkability and traffic calming.

====Cell phone ban====
In 2000, Marlboro became the first municipality in New Jersey, and one of the first areas in the U.S., to ban cell phone use while driving, a ban that took effect in March 2001. The restriction made use of a cell phone a primary offense, allowing a police officer to stop a motorist for phone use.

====Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital====
Opened in 1931, Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital was located on in the eastern part of the township. It was opened with much fanfare as a &quot;state of the art&quot; psychiatric facility. It was closed 67 years later on June 30, 1998, as part of a three-year deinstitutionalization plan in which some the state&#x27;s largest facilities were being shut down, with Marlboro&#x27;s 800 patients being shifted to smaller facilities and group homes. The land that the hospital was placed on was known as the &quot;Big Woods Settlement&quot;. It was largely farm land but there was a large distillery on the property which was torn down to make room for the hospital. Additionally, due to the long residential stays at the hospital, a cemetery was also located near the hospital for the residents who died while in residence and were unclaimed. The hospital was completely demolished in 2015. Most of the land was handed over to the Monmouth County Park system, with some of the ground becoming the final linkage of the Henry Hudson Trail. The park system had developed the Big Brook Park and continues to expand and work on the park to provide services to the Monmouth County residents.

====40% Green====
In June 2009, Marlboro Township Municipal Utilities Authority (MTMUA) deployed a 900 kW solar power array from Sharp that will enable the MTMUA to meet nearly 40% of its electricity needs with emissions-free solar-generated power. This is considered one of the largest of its kind in the East. This solar energy system will reduce New Jersey CO2 emissions by more than annually; SO2 emissions by ; and NO2 emissions by ., as well as eliminating significant amounts of mercury. Additionally, Marlboro has been recognized as a &quot;Cool City&quot; by the Sierra Club. Marlboro is the 10th Monmouth County municipality to be named a Cool City.

====Preston Airfield====
Marlboro had an airport, Preston Airfield, which opened in 1954 and was in operation for almost 50 years. The airport was opened by Rhea Preston on his farm and consisted of two runways, one was as well as airplane hangars. It obtained a paved runway before 1972. In 1974, the airport had approximately 100 planes, 8 of which are used for air instruction. It won many awards and in 1974 was cited by the state Aviation Advisory Council as the &quot;best maintained&quot; airport. In 1975, the airport was given Planning Board approval to expand with 21 additional hangars and add an 840 square foot operations building. Exact records are not known as to when it changed its name to Marlboro Airport. The Garden State Art Center was known to have used the airport to fly in entertainers such as Jimmy Buffett, Jon Bon Jovi, and Howard Stern for performances. Planning board records reflect the intention to make this change in 1976. The NJ department of Transportation provided $4.8 million to expand Preston Airport. In 1979, the airport was described as having a single runway long. The airport was used for private aviation (Fixed wing as well as helicopters) as well as having a private school for flying instruction. In 2000, the airport was purchased by Marlboro Holdings LLC owned by Anthony Spalliero who closed it with the intent to redevelop the airport into housing. To foster the case for redevelopment, Spalliero donated land holdings he had near the airport to the township board of education, which was used to develop the Marlboro Early Learning Center, a school specialized for kindergarten classes. Following a $100,000 pay-off to former mayor Matthew Scannapieco the planning board used the distance to the new school as justification to close the airfield citing a reference to a fatal plane crash in 1997. Part of the airport has now been developed into Marlboro Memorial Cemetery which now borders the defunct airfield. The other part of the airfield has been absorbed into the Monmouth County Park System.

====Virgin Mary sighting====
Starting in 1989, Joseph Januszkiewicz started reporting visions of the Virgin Mary near the blue spruce trees in his yard. The visions started to appear six months after he returned from a pilgrimage to Međugorje in Yugoslavia. Since that time as many as 8,000 pilgrims have gathered on the first Sundays of June, July, August and September to pray, meditate and share in the vision. On September 7, 1992, Bishop John C. Reiss gave Januszkiewicz permission to release his messages. In 1993, the Catholic Diocese of Trenton ruled that nothing &quot;truly miraculous&quot; was happening at the Januszkiewicz home. Pictures were taken in November 2004 of a paranormal mist that showed up at the location of the vision, though by April 2005, Januszkiewicz claimed that the visions had stopped and he reports there have been no sightings since.

==== Train crash ====
On October 13, 1919, a Central Railroad train collided with a truck on the Hudson Street crossing. The truck was owned by Silvers Company. The train suffered a derailment but the accident only had one loss of life. Michael Mooney, train engineer, died from burns from the train boiler water.

===Historic sites===
Marlboro Township has a number of historically significant sites. These were identified by the Marlboro Township Historic Commission, Monmouth County Historical Association, Monmouth County Park System and other entities. The township of Marlboro has erected signs in front of some of the historically significant buildings to explain their historical significant status. Multiple signs can be seen along Main Street and on some other streets in the town center area.

The Marlboro Township Historic Commission was set up to assist in preserving and publicizing the township&#x27;s history. It recommends programs and policies to the mayor and the township council on issues of historic significance. It provides homeowners with information on historic preservation and renovation. The commission also maintains signs in Marlboro Township of some of the historically significant locations. The Historic Commission is comprised of nine members, appointed by the mayor for three year terms, who volunteer their time without receiving any compensation.

====Affordable housing====
As part of its obligation under the Mount Laurel doctrine, the Council on Affordable Housing requires Marlboro Township to provide 1,673 low / moderate income housing units. The first two rounds of New Jersey&#x27;s affordable housing regulations ran from 1987 to 1999. Under a Regional Contribution Agreement (RCA), Marlboro Township signed an agreement in June 2008 that would have Trenton build or rehabilitate 332 housing units, with Marlboro Township paying $25,000 per unit, a total of $8.3 million to Trenton for taking on the responsibility for these units. Under proposed legislation, municipalities may lose the ability to use these RCAs to pay other communities to accept their New Jersey COAH fair housing obligations, which would mean that Marlboro Township is now required to build the balance of housing. When the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing requested plans to complete this obligation, Marlboro generated the largest number of objectors to an affordable housing plan in the history of New Jersey. Numerous appeals followed and in October 2010, the Appellate Division struck down portions of the 2007 regulations, invalidated the growth share methodology and directed COAH to develop new regulations. The NJ supreme court granted all petitions for certification in October 2010 and is set to hear the appeals. In June 2011, the governor issued a reorganization plan which eliminated the 12-member COAH, though state courts overturned the governor&#x27;s plan.

===Dog parks===
Marlboro has an off-leash dog park located at the township municipal complex off Wyncrest Road, located on Recreation Way.

===Fossil collecting===
Open to the public, Big Brook transects the border of Colts Neck and Marlboro, New Jersey. The stream cuts through sediments that were deposited during the Late Cretaceous period. Reportedly, prolific finds of fossils, such as shark teeth, and other deposits of Cretaceous marine fossils, including belemnites are frequently found. This is a particularly fossiliferous site, with finds including fish teeth, crab and crustacean claws, shark teeth, rarely dinosaur teeth, dinosaur bone fragments (and on a very rare occasion a complete bone), megalodonyx (prehistoric sloth) teeth and bone fragments. The area is regarded as one of the top three dinosaur fossil sites in the state. Multiple dinosaur finds have been found in this area. In 2009, a leg section from a duckbilled dinosaur called a hadrosaur was found. The first dinosaur discovery in North America was made in 1858 in this area. Several bones from a Mastodon were found in 2009 by an individual fossil hunting. The deposits of marl which gave the township its name have played a major role in preserving the fossils found in the area. The fossil beds can be accessed from the bridge on Monmouth Road in Marlboro.

===Bow hunting===
Some areas of Monmouth County Big Brook Park allow bow hunting access with a permit.

===Golf===
Bella Vista Country Club has an 18-hole course over 5,923 yards with a par of 70. It is considered a Private Non-Equity club.

===Walking/jogging trail===
The Henry Hudson Trail goes through parts of Marlboro. In September 2009, the Monmouth County Park System closed a section of the Henry Hudson Trail Southern Extension going through Marlboro Township (Aberdeen Township to Freehold) for 18 months while a portion of the path that runs through the Imperial Oil superfund clean-up site was remediated.

===Festivals===
* Music Festival – Spring
* Dinosaur Day – April
* Memorial Day Parade – May
* Marlboro Stomp The Monster 5K &amp; Festival – May
* Marlboro Blues &amp; BBQ Festival – Fall
* Marlboro Day – Summer/Fall
* Halloween Party &amp; Parade – October
* Multicultural Day – November

===Summer camps===
Marlboro Township offers a summer camp program for grade school children. The program is a six-week program, with an optional 7th week consisting of aqua-week. It is run by the Marlboro Township Recreation &amp; Parks Commission.

===Wineries===
* Peppadew Fresh Vineyards

===Future open space===
The township has attempted to preserve the areas known as F&amp;F properties, Stattel&#x27;s Farm and McCarron Farm (also known as Golden Dale Farm) from future development. The last two farms are currently working farms and while the township has purchased the development rights on the property, their fate remains unknown. The development rights of F&amp;F property were purchased for $869,329 to keep the site as open space.

Open space funding is paid for by a number of sources. State and local sources account for most of the funding. Marlboro obtains the funding from a special tax assessment. The town collects $600,000 annually from a local open space tax assessment of 2 cents per $100 of assessed valuation.

==Government==
===Local government===

Marlboro Township is governed within the Faulkner Act under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the mayor, who is elected directly, and the five-member Marlboro Township Council, with all elected positions chosen at-large in partisan voting to serve four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with a municipal election conducted in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election. Three council seats come up for vote together and two other council seats come up for election together with the mayoral seat two years later. At a reorganization meeting held in January after each election, the Council selects a President and Vice-President from among its members. As the township&#x27;s legislative body, the council sets policies, approves budgets, determines municipal tax rates, and passes resolutions and ordinances to govern the township. The council also appoints citizen volunteers to certain advisory boards and the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The council may investigate the conduct of any department, officer or agency of the municipal government. They have full power of subpoena as permitted by statute.

, the Mayor of Marlboro Township is Democrat Jonathan Hornik, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Marlboro Township Council are Council President Michael Milman (D, 2025), Council Vice President Juned Qazi (D, 2025), Antoinette DiNuzzo (D, 2025), Michael Scalea (D, 2027) and Iqleen K. Virdi (D, 2027).

In January 2015, the township council selected Mike Scalea from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2015 of Frank LaRocca, who resigned earlier that month to take a seat as a municipal judge.

==Contaminated and Superfund sites==

===Underground storage tanks===
The NJDEP lists 39 known locations of underground storage tank contamination in Marlboro Township.

===Burnt Fly Bog===
Located off Tyler Lane and Spring Valley Road on the Old Bridge Township border, the area of Burnt Fly Bog in Marlboro Township is listed as a Superfund clean-up site. It is a rural area covering approximately , most of it in Marlboro Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. During the 1950s and early 1960s, many unlined lagoons were used for storage of waste oil. As a result, at least of the bog have been contaminated. In addition to the current contaminated area, the site still consists of: four lagoons; an approximately 13,000-cubic-yard mound of sludge; and an undetermined number of exposed and buried drums. The site is a ground water discharge area for the Englishtown Aquifer. In this bog, ground water, surface water, and air are contaminated by oil and various organic chemicals. Contaminants known to be present include ethylbenzene, methylene chloride, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, base neutral acids, metals, PAHs, PCBs, unknown liquid waste, and VOCs.

A number of studies have been mounted starting in 1981. At that time the EPA awarded a Cooperative Agreement and funds to New Jersey under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Early in 1982, EPA used CERCLA funds to install a fence and repair a section of a dike. In 1983, the state completed (1) a field investigation to study the ground water, (2) a feasibility study for removal of contaminated soil and drums, and (3) a feasibility study for closing the site. EPA and the state continue negotiating agreements for further cleanup activities.

Through 2003, a total of of sedimentation, sludge and soil have been removed for disposal and incineration. The area was then back filled with top soil. In June 2011, a five-year review of the site was published. At that time the remediation status was complete as of date: 9/21/2004. Finally a fence has been installed around the entire site to restrict access and protect human health but has been breached in several locations. The downstream area was cleaned up to residential levels. It was recommended that the NJDEP continued monitoring off Site groundwater for five years. The final suggestion was &quot;Since hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants remain at the Site which do not allow for unlimited use or unrestricted exposure, in accordance with 40 CFR 300.430 (f) (4) (ii), the remedial action for the Site shall be reviewed no less often than every five years. EPA will conduct another five-year review prior to June 2016.&quot;

===Imperial Oil Co.===
This part of land was owned by Imperial Oil Co./Champion Chemicals. The site was added to the National Priorities List of Superfund sites in 1983. The site consists of six production, storage, and maintenance buildings and 56 above-ground storage tanks. Known contamination includes PCBs, arsenic, lead and total petroleum hydrocarbons. A number of companies may have been responsible for waste oil discharges and arsenical pesticides released to a nearby stream as industrial operations date back to 1912. The area is protected by a fence that completely encloses it. This site is being addressed through Federal and State actions. Mayor Hornik of Marlboro Township, described the polluted site as &quot;one of the worst in the country.&quot;

In 1991, EPA excavated and disposed of an on-site waste filter clay pile. In 1997, EPA posted warning signs on the Henry Hudson Trail which is located near the site and the tarp covering the remaining waste filter clay pile was replaced to prevent human contact and limit the migration of the contamination. Arsenic and metals continued to be found in soils in the vicinity of this site. In April 2002, EPA excavated and disposed of a by area of soil containing a tar-like material discovered outside of the fenced area. The presence of elevated levels of PCBs and lead in this material may have presented a physical contact threat to trespassers. In April 2004, of contaminated soil were removed from Birch Swamp Brook and adjacent properties. In August 2007, EPA arranged for
24-hour security at the site, given that Imperial Oil declared bankruptcy and ceased operations at the site during July 2007.

The EPA announced in 2009 the start-up of remediation activities for contaminated soils at the site now called &quot;Operable Unit 3&quot; (OU3). Marlboro Township has received $10–$25 million in stimulus funding to pay for the cost of this cleanup.

On May 3, 2012, the EPA held a press conference. The spokesman &quot;Enck said a $50 million effort over 25 years has cleaned the property, removing 4,600 gallons of oil that pooled on the land, along with 30 million gallons of ground water and 180,000 cubic yards of soil.&quot; A total of $17 million for the clean-up came from the federal Superfund program, with $33 million from the American Resource and Recovery Act.

===Marlboro Middle School===
Marlboro Middle School contamination was an issue which was handled by the state and local level. It was not a Superfund site. This field was a cattle farm prior to being donated to the town for school construction. During the soccer fields improvement program, tests were conducted at the soccer complex which showed elevated levels of unspecified contaminants. The mayor closed the fields as soon as the test results came in. The township then applied for and received a grant to help with the remediation work. Marlboro received money from the Hazardous Discharge Site Remediation Fund to conduct soil remediation at the soccer fields.

===Entron Industries site===
This property clean-up is being handled through the NJEDA and is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. The site is located at the northeastern intersection of Route 79 and Beacon Hill Road. There were a total of 10 buildings on the site along with wooded areas. Investigations found the presence of a variety of unspecified environmental contaminants associated with the construction of rocket launcher parts. In addition, investigations included possible groundwater contamination on the property. There are no current known plans for clean-up, however, public hearings have been held to start the process of clean-up and redevelopment of the area. Marlboro Township was given a total of $200,000 in two different grants to complete remedial investigation of the site by the NJEDA. The mayor has suggested it may take up to $5 million to clean up the land.

After a number of public hearings, on July 14, 2011, a resolution was put forth authorizing the execution of the redevelopment agreement between The Township Of Marlboro and K-Land Corporation For The Property Known As Tax Block 132, Lot 18 (the Entron Industries site). The developer suggested an investment of $100 million to clean up and develop the site. The site is currently under redevelopment. K-land and Marlboro reached an agreement for the development of the Property to include 365 residential units, 33% of which would be set aside as affordable housing units. The Redeveloper created &quot;Camelot at Marlboro&quot;. This housing development has been completed and the property has been restored.

===Arky property===
The Arky property is a non-Superfund clean-up site with focus by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, located at 217 Route 520 in Marlboro Township. This site was an automobile junkyard. Contamination consisted of volatile organic compounds in the groundwater and soil contamination of metals, trichloroethylene (TCE), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Initial clean-up consisted of removal of the contaminated soil. Also found were buried drums of unknown product. There were 22 drums removed. In 1998, NJDEP conducted a second drum removal action. They excavated 70 buried drums and removed some of the contaminated soil around the drums. The drums of hazardous wastes had been crushed and buried prior to 1987. To further monitor the property, NJDEP has installed additional monitor wells near the site to collect ground water samples. Investigations are continuing to determine if additional contamination is present on the site which would require clean-up actions.

===DiMeo property===
This property was purchased by Marlboro Township under P.B. 938-05 for recreational uses, including walking-jogging trails, a playground area and a picnic grove area. The property is located at Pleasant Valley and Conover roads. Clean-up is being handled through the NJEDA and is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. In 2004, Schoor DePalma addressed the contaminated soil on the property. The soil on this property had widespread hazardous levels of arsenic, lead, pesticides and petroleum related contamination; consistent with farming-related operations. Additionally, the property contains a pond that is polluted with arsenic, a common agricultural contaminant.

After clean-up, deep monitoring wells were created. In 2007, Birdsall Engineering investigated arsenic and pesticide contamination on the property. Two isolated hot spots were found with high levels of pesticides. The clean-up work was funded by the state farmland preservation program. In 2008, Marlboro Township received state funds for continued clean-up and monitoring by the NJEDA.

This property is on the border of the land that formerly housed the Marlboro State Psychiatric Hospital. This presents its own possibilities, should the Township of Marlboro purchase the hospital property.

===Big Brook Park===
This site is being addressed through state and local department and funds and is not a superfund clean-up site. In 1997, the Monmouth County Park System bought of the closed Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital land. The intent is to create a regional park, similar to Holmdel Park. It is also expected to be home to part of the Henry Hudson Trail. The plans for the property have not been completed, in part due to potential environmental contamination. Preliminary environmental studies by Birdsall Engineering found asbestos and oil contamination on the grounds. The land is contaminated with arsenic, reportedly a byproduct of farming. In an attempt to further classify the contamination, the Luis Berger Group has done further testing on this site. They are reporting that the arsenic found on the site is &quot;actually a naturally occurring condition in local and regional soil in this area&quot;. Additionally they reported that the site contamination found in the prior study was caused by a number of factors, including a former septic system (Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital discharged the effluent from the hospital into Big Brook), pesticide mixing building, fuel oil underground storage tank, and construction debris. This evaluation made the following recommendations to the NJDEP:
*Tank storage closure and removal—Excavation of surficial soils along with post excavation sampling
*Removal of septic systems
*Asbestos abatement
*Wetlands restoration

===Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital===
The site of the closed Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital has on-site contamination—it is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. Mayor Jonathan Hornik estimates it could cost more than $11 million to clean up. Mayor Jonathan Hornik stated that the state clearly has the responsibility for cleaning up the site. He however stated that, in the interest of getting it done, the township may have to show some flexibility in helping the state defray the costs. In addition to the contamination on the site, the old buildings from the hospital are now in a state of decay and plans were made to demolish them. By 2015 the property had been completely demolished. Buildings, streetlights, roads and underground structures were demolished and removed from the property.

===Murray property===
This site is being addressed through state and local funds and is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. The property is contaminated with an undisclosed substance. To clean up the contamination, 1,708 cubic yards of soil was removed. The site is located on Prescott Drive, Block 233 Lot 13.

==Sister cities==
Marlboro has two sister cities:
* Nanto, Japan
* Wujiang, China

Marlboro&#x27;s first sister city, Nanto was formerly known as Jōhana (Nanto was formed after the merger of the towns of Fukuno, Inami and Jōhana). It was officially Marlboro&#x27;s sister city in August 1991 as part of an agreement signed by mayor Saul Hornik with Johana&#x27;s mayor.

Marlboro&#x27;s second sister city, Wujiang is an urban city in Jiangsu Province of southeast China. It has been regarded for &quot;The Land of Rice and Fish&quot; and &quot;The Capital of Silk&quot;. It is recently known for being the &quot;Capital of Electronics&quot;. Wujiang officially became a sister city with Marlboro in December 2011.

There are youth exchanges with each of these cities. In February 2011, there were 41 exchange students from Wujiang City, China welcomed into the homes of Marlboro. They were also welcomed August 2012 and August 2014. However, beginning in 2014, exchange students from Wujiang City visit Marlboro every other summer.

<text>Matawan () is a borough in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A historic community located near the Raritan Bay in the much larger Raritan Valley region, the borough is a commuter town of New York City within the New York Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 9,565, an increase of 755 (+8.6%) from the 2010 census count of 8,810, which in turn reflected a decline of 100 (−1.1%) from the 8,910 counted in the 2000 census.

Matawan was part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area&#x27;s economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, dense residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural beauty of the Raritan Bayshore coastline. The plan has since been integrated into the 2016 Monmouth County Master Plan. Matawan is a part of the New Jersey Transit Village Initiative, a type of residential-focused transit-oriented development focused around the Aberdeen-Matawan train station.

==History==

The Lenape Native Americans called the area &quot;&quot;, which gave rise to the area being called &quot;Matovancons&quot; by Dutch settlers, from which derives the name &quot;Matawan&quot;. The name may derive from a Lenape language word meaning &quot;where two rivers come together&quot; or it may originate from the Southern Unami &#x27;, &quot;bad riverbank&quot; or &quot;bad hill&quot;, a possible reference to bluffs along Raritan Bay which were subject to erosion and collapse prior to the construction of a seawall in the 1970s. Another possible source is &#x27;, Northern Unami for &quot;bad fog&quot;, which may have referred to fog generated on Raritan Bay. Other possible meanings are &quot;magician&quot;, &quot;charmed skin&quot; or &quot;it arrives in a lake&quot;.

The community was established by Dutch settlers in the 17th century (Matawan celebrated a tricentennial in the 1980s). In 1686, Scotch-Irish settlers from New Hampshire later named the town New Aberdeen, and later Mount Pleasant. The town consisted with a church and a few houses around where southern Main Street and Freneau Avenue are. Neighboring Matawan Township reused the historic name in the 1970s when it changed its name to Aberdeen Township. As docks were built along Matawan Creek, which led to the area being called Middletown Point, which helped increase trade and commerce in the town. By the mid 18th century, the town became the main point of water-bound export and entry for Monmouth County. Over the course of the 18th century, the main center of the town moved north toward where it is today on Main Street. Some of Monmouth County&#x27;s wealthiest merchants and tradesmen made their homes along Main Street during this time, many of which remain today.

On May 27, 1778, the Burrowes Mansion, which was built in 1723 and located on Main Street, and sold to wealthy grain merchant John &quot;Corn King&quot; Burrowes Sr. in 1769, was the site of a skirmish between the Patriots and the British during the Revolutionary War. The mansion is the site where the first New Jersey Company of the Continental Army formed, as John Burrowes Jr. trained local militia in his front yard. Local Patriots used whaleboats stored in Lake Matawan to attack British ships in the Raritan Bay. In response, British General Cortlandt Skinner, leading his Loyalist &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Greens&quot;, attacked Matawan with the (successful) intention of burning down the warehouses and mills owned by Burrowes and to capture Burrowes Jr. 200 Greens made their way from Sandy Hook, and greatly outnumbered the Matawan Patriots. Burrowes Jr. was able to avoid capture by swimming across Matawan Creek and hide, however Burrowes Sr. and several other Patriots were captured. Nearby, a house on Ravine Drive was owned by Samuel Forman, a wealthy merchant and Continental Army colonel and business partner with John Burrowes Sr. Forman had three sons, all of which became officers in the Continental Army, with the oldest Johnathan becoming a general. Of his four daughters, two married prominent local men, with Margaret marrying John Burrowes Jr. (where she was attacked by the loyalists during the skirmish at the Burrowes Mansion) and Eleanor marrying Philip Freneau, who was known as the &quot;Poet of the Revolution&quot;. On May 23, 1779, there was another skirmish between the American militia and British troops near the Forman house, and the militia successfully forced the British to retreat down a hill and swim across the Matawan Creek into the Raritan Bay. The house became nicknamed the &quot;Old Hospital&quot; because many wounded soldiers were cared for in the house. In 1795, Philip Freneau established Monmouth County&#x27;s first newspaper, the Jersey Chronicle. In the 1830s, with the invention of the steamboat, Matawan grew and prospered, as it allowed for goods to be more accessible to the New York regional market.

Between 1820 and 1870, property owners began subdividing their land, which led to a building boom with various new streets and homes opening up surrounding Main Street. Midway Alley, now Jackson Street, was opened in 1821 from Ravine Drive to Church Street.  In 1833, Wycoff and Spring Streets were opened. In the 1840s Washington, Monroe, Franklin, Part of Jackson, Little, North, South, and Mill Streets were opened along with Rabbit Lane and Steamboat Alley. Broad Street, which used to be known as Second Street, was opened between Church and South Streets as well as a short piece off Little Street. By 1852 it was extended from Little to South Street and had been renamed Broad Street.  The 1850s also saw the opening of Orchard, Center, Stillwell (then Division) and High Streets and Park Ave (then New St.) In the 1860s Clinton and Atlantic Streets were opened, as well as Hoyt Street and Johnson Avenue. Between 1830 and 1860, lumber mills, shipping warehouses, brickyards, and a ceramic industry which focused on pottery, stoneware, and tile were established. In 1865, due to postal confusion with Middletown, the Middletown Point post office was renamed &quot;Matawan&quot;, to reflect the name of the Township. In 1869, David Bell began publishing the weekly Matawan Journal newspaper. Matawan&#x27;s current character on Main Street formed during the late 19th century as schools, banks, stores, churches, and dwellings were formed on and around Main Street. The Matawan Train Station (later renamed Aberdeen-Matawan when the new station building was built on the Aberdeen side) was established in 1875, which helped sustain the town&#x27;s prominence as a transportation center as Matawan Creek began silting, which led to a decline in ship commerce.

In 1857, the town of Middletown Point was renamed to Matavan Township after it was officially incorporated, being carved from Raritan Township, and was named after Matawan Creek. In 1882, Matavan was renamed Matawan. In 1883, a referendum to establish Matawan as a borough failed 93–79. In 1885, a referendum was held again, passing 144–133, although this was followed by years of opposition to the change. Matawan Borough was formed on June 28, 1895, from portions of Matawan Township (now Aberdeen Township), based on the results of a referendum held that day. Matawan expanded with portions of Matawan Township in 1931 and 1933, and from Madison Township (now Old Bridge Township) in 1939.

Despite being from the Atlantic Ocean, Matawan was the site of three shark attacks on July 12, 1916, in Matawan Creek, causing two deaths. They closely followed an attack in Beach Haven on July 1 and one in Spring Lake on July 6 that were all part of the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916. Today, there is a shark mural located in Matawan Creek visible off High Street.

In 1894, an eight-room brick school building was built on the corner of Broad Street and South Street. In 1901, the most disastrous fire in Matawan history destroyed six buildings in the most major part of the business district. In 1923, Lake Matawan was created by damming Gravelly Brook. In 1924, the Matawan High School was built in the same location due to overcrowding concerns at the old school. In 1928, Matawan Creek was dammed to create Lake Lefferts. Also in 1928, Memorial Park was established to honor World War I veterans. In 1929, The Phyllis Wheatley Club, an organization for black women, is formed with 23 members. In 1930, Henry S. Terhune gifted Terhune Park between Main and Broad Streets. In 1938, the current Post Office is built on Main Street. In 1954, the Matawan First Aid and Rescue Squad is established. In 1962, the current Matawan Regional High School was built on Atlantic Avenue in Matawan Township. For the previous two centuries, area surrounding Main Street and its immediate vicinity mostly consisted of farmland and woodland, but around the mid 20th century suburban development brought suburban divisions and highways into the town. In 1988, a Ceronics Inc manufacturing plant on Main Street was destroyed by a fire. In July 1988, the 82 year old Dell&#x27;s Meat Market closed. In August 1988, Rose Hill Cemetery, which held many famous locals dating back to 1802, was restored. In September 1988, Matawan celebrated its 300th anniversary.

Matawan played an important role in aviation navigation history. In 1944, the first operational Visual Aural Range (VAR) was installed at Matawan. Designed in 1937 at the Bureau of Air Commerce&#x27;s research center, this system operated in the VHF band around 63 mHz and was an incremental improvement over prior aviation navigation systems such as the four-course radio range. VAR was later redeveloped into VOR.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Freneau and Oak Shades.

The borough borders Aberdeen Township and Marlboro Township in Monmouth County, as well as Old Bridge Township in Middlesex County. Matawan divides Aberdeen Township into two non-contiguous sections, with a small wedge-shaped exclave on the township&#x27;s southwest corner separated from the rest of the township by a portion of Matawan located on the opposite side of Route 79.

In 2023, an analysis using FBI statistics on small town safety determined that Matawan was the 194th safest small town in the United States.

According to the Monmouth County Master Plan, Matawan has been designated as an upcoming Arts, Cultural, and Entertainment (ACE) Hub, which is defined as municipalities that have a high concentration of arts and cultural activities to serve as a destination for both visitors and locals, usually including an active nightlife scene in proximity to said cultural activities. Only eight towns in Monmouth County share this designation.

<text>Middletown Township is a township in northern Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township was the state&#x27;s 20th-most-populous municipality and the largest in the county, with a population of 67,106, an increase of 584 (+0.9%) from the 2010 census count of 66,522, which in turn reflected an increase of 195 residents (0.3%) from its population of 66,327 at the 2000 census, when it was the state&#x27;s 17th-most-populous municipality.

Middletown is a bedroom community of New York City, located alongside of the Raritan Bay within the Raritan Valley region in the New York metropolitan area. Due to its affluence, low crime, access to cultural activities, public school system, location at the Jersey Shore and Raritan Bayshore, and central commuting location, Middletown was ranked in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2014 in the Top 100 in CNNMoney.com&#x27;s Best Places to Live. &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed Middletown on its list of &quot;Best Places to Live 2014&quot;.

In 2016, SafeWise named Middletown Township as the fifth-safest city in America to raise a child; the township was the highest ranked of the 12 communities in New Jersey included on the list.

==History==
Small communities of the Lenape Navesink tribe were common throughout the area when the first known European landing in what would become Middletown Township occurred in 1609. Sea captain and explorer Henry Hudson, in search of the mythical Northwest Passage in the service of the Dutch West India Company, anchored along the shores of Sandy Hook Bay in 1609, describing the area &quot;a very good land to fall in with and a pleasant land to see.&quot; While a patroonship was granted by the company in 1651 the land wasn&#x27;t officially settled. Today&#x27;s Shoal Harbor Museum and Old Spy House includes portions of a house constructed by Thomas Whitlock, one of the area&#x27;s first European settlers (and a Reformed Baptist at Middletown) who arrived here as early as 1664, around the time of the English takeover of New Netherland as a prelude of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Long-standing tradition had Penelope Stout, one of the first settlers, hiding in a tree from hostile Native Americans.

Shortly after the Dutch surrender of the New Netherland to the English in 1664 a large tract of land known as the Navesink Patent or Monmouth Tract was granted to Baptist and Quaker settlers from Long Island, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. In 1693 the triangular tract became three townships – Middletown Township, Shrewsbury Township and Freehold Township.

During the American Revolutionary War, Middletown and much of the rest of Eastern Monmouth County was held by the British. After the Battle of Monmouth, the British retreat from Freehold Township carried them down King&#x27;s Highway through Middletown to their embarkation points at Sandy Hook in the bay, heading back to New York City.

Middletown Township was originally formed on October 31, 1693, and was incorporated as a township by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form Atlantic Township (February 8, 1847, now Colts Neck Township), Raritan Township (February 25, 1848, now Hazlet), Atlantic Highlands (February 28, 1887), Highlands (March 22, 1900) and Keansburg (March 22, 1917).

Upon the completion of a railroad junction in 1875, the town grew more rapidly, eventually changing from a group of small and loosely connected fishing and agricultural villages into a fast-growing suburb at the turn of the 20th century. If Middletown ever had a recognizable town center or town square, it was lost in that rapid growth soon after World War II.

In May 1958, several Nike Ajax missiles exploded at Battery NY-53 in Chapel Hill, killing ten Army and civilian personnel. The accident was one of the worst missile-related disasters of the Cold War.

During the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, Middletown lost 37 of its residents at the World Trade Center, which was the second-most 9/11 deaths of any municipality, behind New York City itself. The World Trade Center Memorial Gardens were opened to the public on September 11, 2003, the second anniversary of the attacks.

The Waterfront site of Naval Weapons Station Earle is located in Leonardo on Sandy Hook Bay, and is used to load ammunition onto ships on a finger pier that stretches for , making it the world&#x27;s second-longest such pier.

The &quot;Evil Clown of Middletown&quot; is a towering sign along Route 35 painted to resemble a circus clown, that currently advertises a liquor store. The sign is a remnant of an old supermarket that used to be at that location called &quot;Food Circus&quot;. The clown and recent successful attempts from residents to save it from demolition have been featured in the pages of &quot;Weird NJ&quot; magazine, on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and in the Kevin Smith-directed film &quot;Clerks II&quot;.

The Indian Trails 15K road race is held each year in April to benefit the Monmouth Conservation Foundation and includes a 5K walk/run event for fun. The race, run on a combination on paved and dirt roads, includes many relatively steep hills and has been described as &quot;the most challenging race in the state&quot;.

The Middletown Township Historical Society is a non-profit formed in 1968 to preserve and promote the history of Middletown.

<text>Millstone Township is a township in western Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is located within the Raritan Valley region and is a part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 10,376, a decrease of 190 (−1.8%) from the 2010 census count of 10,566, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,596 (+17.8%) from the 8,970 counted in the 2000 census.

The township was named after the Millstone River, a major tributary of the Raritan River, and whose name originated from an incident in which a millstone was dropped into the river. The headwaters for the Millstone River originate in the township.

The township has been ranked as one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Millstone residents had a median household income of $156,891, more than double the statewide median of $76,475 and ranked ninth in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents.

==History==

Millstone was formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 28, 1844, from portions of Freehold Township and Upper Freehold Township, as well as part of Monroe Township in Middlesex County. The portions taken from Monroe Township were relinquished in 1845. On May 29, 1937, portions of the township were taken to form the borough of Jersey Homesteads (now Roosevelt).

The township has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Millstone Township residents had a median household income of $156,891, ranked 9th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 37.18 square miles (96.30 km2), including 36.61 square miles (94.81 km2) of land and 0.58 square miles (1.49 km2) of water (1.55%).

There are two unincorporated communities within the township served by the United States Postal Service as post offices. Clarksburg is served by post office ZIP Code 08510 and Perrineville is served as ZIP code 08535. Other unincorporated communities and place names located entirely or partially within the township include Baird, Bairdsville, Bergen Mills, Burksville, Carrs Corner, Carrs Tavern, Charleston Springs, Disbrow Hill, Ely, Elys Corner, Fair Play, Hillhurt, Holmeson, Pine Hill, Smithburg, Stone Tavern and Sweetman.

The township borders Freehold Township, Manalapan Township, Roosevelt and Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County; East Windsor and Robbinsville Township in Mercer County; Monroe Township in Middlesex County; and Jackson Township in Ocean County.

===Major bodies of water===

Due to the township&#x27;s unique location in the center of New Jersey, it is the home of numerous headwaters for various important rivers, brooks, and streams that flow throughout the state. The township is located on a ridge within the geographic heartland of New Jersey. The township falls within the hillier terrain and fertile soil found in the Inner coastal plain, while a small sliver of the eastern border of the township (which borders Jackson Township) is located within the flat terrain and sandier soil found in the Outer coastal plain.

Much of the township is centrally located within the much larger Raritan Valley region&#x27;s watershed (as many of its brooks and streams flow into the river). The township is the headwaters for the Millstone River, one of the most important tributaries of the aforementioned river. Part of the township also belongs to the Delaware Valley region&#x27;s watershed, with the Assunpink Creek and the Doctors Creek flowing through the southern and western sections of the township bordering Upper Freehold Township. Part of the Assunpink Wildlife Preservation Area is located in the township, as well as in portions of Upper Freehold Township, Roosevelt and Robbinsville Township. The reservation offers wetlands and lakes for viewing migratory birds, in addition to mountain biking trails, bridle paths and hiking trails, operated under the supervision of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife. Turkey Swamp Park is another nature reservation which features wetlands, hiking trails, and even campgrounds, located in neighboring Freehold Township. The township is also one of only two municipalities in Monmouth County that are part of the Toms River watershed, most of which is located in Ocean County, as it rises from the Millstone and Jackson area, flowing southward through the New Jersey Pine Barrens to the Barnegat Bay.

Jones to fill the seat expiring in December 2025 that became vacant following the resignation of Keith Cafferty the previous month.

<text>Ancel Benjamin Keys (January 26, 1904 – November 20, 2004) was an American physiologist who studied the influence of diet on health. In particular, he hypothesized that replacing dietary saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat reduced cardiovascular diseases. Modern dietary recommendations by health organizations, systematic reviews, and national health agencies corroborate this.

Keys studied starvation in men and published &quot;The Biology of Human Starvation&quot; (1950), which remains the only source of its kind. He examined the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and was responsible for two famous diets: K-rations, formulated as balanced meals for combat soldiers in World War II, and the Mediterranean diet, which he popularized with his wife Margaret.

==Early life==
Ancel Benjamin Keys was born in Colorado Springs on January 26, 1904, the son of Benjamin Pious Keys (1883–1961) and Carolyn Emma Chaney (1885–1960), the sister of actor and director Lon Chaney (1883–1930). In 1906 they moved to San Francisco before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck. Shortly after the disaster, his family relocated to Berkeley where he grew up. Keys was intelligent as a boy; Lewis Terman, a noted psychologist and inventor of the Stanford-Binet IQ Test, described him as intellectually &quot;gifted&quot;. During his youth, he left high school to pursue odd jobs, such as shoveling bat guano in Arizona, being a powder monkey in a Colorado mine, and working in a lumber camp. He eventually finished his secondary education and was admitted to the University of California at Berkeley in 1922.

===Higher education===

At the University of California, Berkeley, Keys initially studied chemistry, but was dissatisfied and took some time off to work as an oiler aboard the American President Lines ship SS &quot;President Wilson&quot;, which traveled to China. He then returned to Berkeley, switched majors, and graduated with a B.A. in economics and political science (1925) and M.S. in zoology (1928).

For a brief time, he took up a job as a management trainee at Woolworth&#x27;s, but returned to his studies at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla on a fellowship.

In 1930, he received his Ph.D. in oceanography and biology from UC Berkeley. He was then awarded a National Research Council fellowship that took him to Copenhagen, Denmark to study under August Krogh at the Zoophysiological Laboratory for two years. During his studies with Krogh, he studied fish physiology and contributed numerous papers on the subject.

Once his fellowship ended, he went to Cambridge but took some time off to teach at Harvard University, after which he returned to Cambridge and earned a second Ph.D. in physiology (1936).

==Scientific work==

===Early physiology studies===

While doing fish research at Scripps, Keys would use statistical regressions to estimate the weight of fish from their length, at that time a pioneering use of biostatistics. Once in Copenhagen (1931), he continued to study fish physiology and developed techniques for gill perfusion that provided evidence that fish regulated their sodium by controlling chloride excretion through their gills. He would also use this perfusion method to study the effects of adrenaline and vasopressin (&quot;pitressin&quot;) on gill fluid flow and osmotic regulation in fishes. He also designed an improved Kjeldahl apparatus, which improved upon Krogh&#x27;s earlier design, and allowed for more rapid determination of nitrogen content in biological samples. This would prove useful for activities as diverse as determining the protein content in grasshopper eggs and anemia in humans.

While at Harvard&#x27;s Fatigue Laboratory, he was inspired by his Cambridge mentor Joseph Barcroft&#x27;s ascent to the top of Tenerife&#x27;s highest peak and his subsequent reports. Keys wrote up a proposal for an expedition to the Andes, suggesting the study could have practical value for Chilean miners who worked at high elevations. He was given the go-ahead and, in 1935, assembled a team to study the effects of high altitude on the body, such as how it affects blood pressure. He spent a couple of months at 9,500 feet (3,000 m.), and then five weeks at elevations of 15,000 to 20,000 feet (4,500 to 6,000 m.).

He noted there was no good way of predicting how well humans might adapt to high altitude, even if they adapted well to medium altitudes, a problem for potential pilots in a time before pressure control had become practical. It was from these studies that he outlined the phenomenon of human physiological adaptation to environmental changes as a predictable event, a novel idea in a time when such parameters as blood pressure and resting heart-rate were considered immutable characteristics of individuals.

===Development of K-rations===

In 1936, Keys was offered a position at the Mayo Foundation in Rochester, where he continued his studies in physiology. He left after a year, citing an intellectually stifling environment where research was secondary to clinical &quot;doc business&quot; and playing bridge.

In 1937, he left the Mayo Foundation to teach physiology at the University of Minnesota, where he founded the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene. His earlier research on human physiology led to an assignment with the Army Quartermaster Corps, where they worked to develop a more portable and nonperishable ration that would provide enough calories to sustain soldiers (such as paratroopers) in the field for up to two weeks.

This development did not begin without some turbulence. His colleague, Elsworth Buskirk, recalled:

Once the basic design had been completed, the Navy, through the National Research Council, funded the testing of the K-rations on its sailors to determine their feasibility as a temporary and mobile food source. The initial ingredients of the K-ration were procured at a local Minneapolis grocery store—hard biscuits, dry sausage, hard candy, and chocolate. The final product was different from Keys&#x27; original ingredients, but most of Keys&#x27; suggestions made it to the final product. The rations weighed only , but provided 3200 calories per day. Though several sources claim the name was unrelated to Keys, many historical references support the claim that the K-ration was indeed named after him. The K-ration became such a success that it was often used for more than temporary sustenance, becoming a major staple of military nutrition.

===Starvation study===
During World War II, Keys produced various studies related to human physical performance that were of interest to the military, such as studying the effects of testosterone on muscle work and vitamin supplementation as a performance enhancer on adequately fed soldiers, among many other similar studies. It was during the war that Keys and fellow researchers recognized the importance of knowing how to properly treat widespread starvation, since simple overfeeding for so many would be imprecise and there was a potential that the refeeding would fail.

To gain insight into the physiology of starvation, in 1944 Keys carried out a starvation study with 36 conscientious objectors as test subjects in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. At the time, conscientious objectors were being placed in virtual concentration camps, with a few functioning like the Civilian Public Service, so that recruiting them would prove easier than seeking out volunteers in the general population. The original pool of 400 responders was reduced to 36 selectees, of whom 32 would go on to complete the study. The main focus of the study was threefold: set a metabolic baseline for three months, study the physical and mental effects of starvation on the volunteers for six months, and then study the physical and mental effects of different refeeding protocols on them for three months. The participants would first be placed on the three-month baseline diet of 3200 calories after which their calories were reduced to 1800 calories/day while expending 3000 calories in activities such as walking. The final three months were a refeeding period where the volunteers were divided into four groups, each receiving a different caloric intake.

The war came to an end before the final results of the study could be published, but Keys sent his findings to various international relief agencies throughout Europe and, by 1950, he completed publication of his two-volume 1385-page &quot;Biology of Human Starvation&quot;.

===Seven Countries Study===

His interest in diet and cardiovascular disease (CVD) was prompted, in part, by seemingly counter-intuitive data: American business executives, presumably among the best-fed people, had high rates of heart disease, while in post-war Europe CVD rates had decreased sharply in the wake of reduced food supplies. Keys postulated a correlation between cholesterol levels and CVD and initiated a study of Minnesota businessmen (the first prospective study of CVD). At a 1955 expert meeting at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Keys presented his diet-lipid-heart disease hypothesis. As part of his argument, he presented a correlation between deaths from heart disease and percentage of fat in the diet that featured six countries. His rationale and conclusions were heavily critiqued by two other epidemiologists.

After observing in southern Italy the highest concentration of centenarians in the world, Keys hypothesized that a Mediterranean-style diet low in animal fat protected against heart disease and that a diet high in animal fats led to heart disease. This finding helped Keys initiate a long-term observational study, known as the Seven Countries Study, which appeared to show that serum cholesterol was strongly related to coronary heart disease mortality both at the population and individual levels.

Keys had concluded that saturated fats as found in milk and meat have adverse effects, while unsaturated fats found in vegetable oils had beneficial effects. A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration, an organisation which promotes evidence-based medicine, found that reducing saturated fat intake reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease, concluding: &quot;Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats.&quot;

Keys stated that of the 12,000 men in seven countries studied in 1960, those least likely to develop cardiovascular disease lived in Crete.

After Keys&#x27; retirement from the University of Minnesota in 1972, his protege Henry Blackburn, MD became director of the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene. Blackburn continued research on the role of lifestyle including diet in the cause and prevention of heart disease. The department played an active role in multicenter trials of the 1970s–80s and population strategies of surveillance and preventive interventions in Minnesota.

=== Minnesota Coronary Experiment ===
In 1968, about ten years after the beginning and two years after the first publication of the results of the &quot;Seven Countries Study&quot;, Keys and Ivan Frantz initiated a large randomized control trial, replacing saturated fats by food items with naturally high or artificially raised content of linoleic acid in an &quot;intervention group&quot;.

The randomized and blinded experiment ended in 1973. Results were not published until only much later in form of smaller excerpts as part of conference talks or doctoral theses. The raw data and analysis were discovered in 2013 in the estate of the principal investigator, Ivan Frantz.

The study shows no positive effects of the altered dietary intake. Cardiovascular mortality of patients over 65 years of age increased by the replacement of saturated fats.

The 2016 paper &quot;Re-evaluation of the traditional diet-heart hypothesis: analysis of recovered data from Minnesota Coronary Experiment&quot; concludes:

===Keys equation===
The Keys equation predicts the effect of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet on serum cholesterol levels. Keys found that saturated fats increase total and LDL cholesterol twice as much as polyunsaturated fats lower them.
:Change in serum cholesterol concentration

:where Dsf is the change in percentage of dietary energy from saturated fats, Dpuf is the change in percentage of dietary energy from polyunsaturated fats, and Dch is the change in intake of dietary cholesterol.

===BMI and other contributions===
In a 1972 article, Keys and his coauthors promoted Adolphe Quetelet&#x27;s body mass index (BMI) as &quot;preferable over other indices of relative weight on [correlation with height and measures of body fatness] as well as on the simplicity of the calculation and, in contrast to percentage of average weight, the applicability to all populations at all times&quot;, which the U.S. National Institutes of Health then popularized in 1985.

Keys was always considered an interventionist. He generally shunned food fads and vigorously promoted the putative benefits of the &quot;reasonably low-fat diets&quot; which he contrasted with &quot;the North American habit for making the stomach the garbage disposal unit for a long list of harmful foods.&quot; Because of his influence in dietary science, Keys was featured on the cover of the January 13, 1961, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Later years and death==
When Keys was hired at the Mayo Foundation in 1936, he hired Margaret Haney (1909–2006) as a medical technologist. In 1939 they married and had three children: Carrie D&#x27;Andrea, Henry Keys, and Martha McLain. Carrie became a clinical psychologist and Henry became a physician and cancer researcher. Both are well respected contributors to their fields. Martha was shot dead by a thief in 1991 when she was 42.

Together, Margaret and Keys co-authored three books, two of them bestsellers. They earned enough royalties to build Minnelea, their villa in the seaside village of Pioppi, in the Cilento region on the southwest coast of Italy, where Keys lived and worked from 1963 to 1998. They also traveled the world, going to places like Japan and South Africa to record data for Keys&#x27;s published works, such as the Seven Countries Study. The village of Pioppi became the location of the &quot;Living Museum of the Mediterranean Diet&quot;, which houses a documentary, photograph and film archive regarding the historic, scientific, and cultural background of the Mediterranean diet.

Keys appeared on the &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; game show as the inventor of K-Rations, fooling two of the four panelists.

Keys received three notable awards: Commander, Order of the Lion of Finland (1963), the McCollum Award from the American Society of Clinical Nutrition (1967), and an honorary doctor of science from the University of Minnesota (2001).

On January 26, 2004, Keys celebrated his 100th birthday.

Keys died on November 20, 2004, in Minneapolis, two months before his 101st birthday.

Keys was an atheist.

==Criticism==

Keys has received criticism from the low-carbohydrate diet community, who have argued that his Seven Countries Study excluded countries that did not fit his hypothesis. Critics raised four primary objections to the Seven Countries Study, including (1) countries were selected and excluded based on a desired outcome; (2) France, a high-fat, low-heart disease country, was purposefully excluded from the survey; (3) dietary data in Greece taken during Lent introduced a distortion; and (4) sugar was not considered as a possible contributor to coronary heart disease. In response to this criticism, on August 1, 2017, the True Health Initiative released a 65-page white paper entitled &quot;Ancel Keys and the Seven Countries Study: An Evidence-based Response to Revisionist Histories,&quot; correcting what they felt were historical inaccuracies and errors that low-carb advocates had perpetuated.

<text>Neptune City is a borough in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,626, a decrease of 244 (−5.0%) from the 2010 census count of 4,869, which in turn reflected a decline of 349 (−6.7%) from the 5,218 counted in the 2000 census.

The Borough of Neptune City was incorporated on October 4, 1881, based on a referendum held on March 19, 1881. The boundaries included all of present-day Neptune City, along with what is now Avon-by-the-Sea and the southern portion of Bradley Beach. On March 23, 1900, a bill approved in the New Jersey Legislature created the Borough of Avon-by-the-Sea. On March 13, 1907, the eastern portion of Neptune City was annexed to the Borough of Bradley Beach. The borough was named for Neptune, the Roman water deity, and its location on the Atlantic Ocean.

The earliest borough hall was erected in 1902 at the northwest corner of Evergreen Avenue and Railroad Avenue (now Memorial Drive).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.90 square miles (2.32 km2), all of which was land.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Neptune Heights and Ocean Grove Heights.

The borough borders the Monmouth County municipalities of Avon-by-the-Sea, Bradley Beach and Neptune Township.

==Government==

===Local government===
Neptune City is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Neptune City is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of the Borough of Neptune City is Republican Andrew Wardell, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Neptune City Borough Council are Council President Glen Kocsis (D, 2026), Kimberly Karalovich (D, 2027), Gail L. Oliver (D, 2027), Danielle Pappas (R, 2025), Pamela Renee (D, 2026) and Brian J. Thomas (R, 2025).

With Republican Richard Pryor and Democrat Michael Skudera tied at 602 votes after the November 2015 general election for the second of two seats, the two candidates faced off in a March 2016 special election, won by Pryor by a 511–478 margin.

Before Woodrow Wilson School was constructed, students attended Roosevelt School on Third Avenue, which was demolished after being deemed beyond repair and became the site of Joe Freda Park.

Public school students in ninth through twelfth grades attend Neptune High School as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Neptune Township Schools; in a study published in May 2015, the district looked at modifying its relationship with the Neptune Township district, considering leaving the agreement unchanged, adding students in grades 6–8 to the sending arrangement or a regionalization of the two districts.

==Landmarks==

Steiner and Son&#x27;s Pajama Factory was the first factory built in Neptune City, constructed in 1891 on land donated by James A. Bradley. Immanuel Steiner was a silk dealer in Austria when he emigrated to New York City in the late 1860s. He began manufacturing pajamas and nightgowns in New York City shortly thereafter. With his sons Edwin and Clarence, they sought to expand operations, opting to construct the flagship factory at the corner of Fourth and Railroad Avenue (now Memorial Drive.) The construction costs were $17,590 and the brickwork was carried out by A.A. Taylor of Asbury Park. Their flagship product, &quot;The Universal Nightshirt&quot; became enormously popular throughout the country. Within two years time, they constructed another nearly identical factory three blocks north (since the 1930s this has been the home of The SS Adams Novelty Company). Their first national slogan was &quot;We Put the World To Sleep&quot;.

By 1918, Steiner and Sons had nearly 2,000 employees in factories in Neptune City, Neptune, Asbury Park, Long Branch, Keyport, Freehold, Manasquan and Toms River. They built a baseball park on the land between the two factories on Fourth and Seventh Avenues. In the spring of 1922, Babe Ruth and other members of the New York Yankees played an exhibition game there. Edwin Steiner assumed control at his father&#x27;s death, and he expanded the original building considerably. The Steiner corporation had a reputation for spotlessly clean working conditions, and the quality of their products is attested to in countless period advertisements stretching all the way to California.

The first ever murder in Neptune City occurred in 1929, as part of a payroll robbery. George Danielson, a 65-year-old courier from the First National Bank in Bradley Beach was shot point-blank at the employee entrance on 4th Avenue. The bandits got away with the payroll of $7,280 and were later caught and tried.

In the late 1920s, the Steiner corporation purchased and merged with the Liberty Nightshirt Company, headquartered in Baltimore. The decline in demand for nightshirts was one of the reasons for the acquisition. The same circumstances forced the company to shutter most of their other area operations. Tax squabbles with the Borough of Neptune City led them to close their long-time headquarters in Neptune City in 1939 and move to Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania. They eventually went out of business.

Mario Mirabelli and his brother Michael were running a military clothing manufacturing outfit in Elizabeth at the time when they purchased the building in 1940. They expanded their operations and won considerable government contracts during the Second World War. They produced close to $11 million worth of military clothing during the war. The Mirabelli Company continued to win military contracts after the war. Mario Mirabelli was called to testify before Congress in the late 1950s when government suppliers were accused of forcing the company to manufacture items using second-rate materials that were deemed unusable by other government manufacturing outfits. The scandal hurt Mirabelli&#x27;s business and reputation. They continued to win small government contracts until the early 1960s, but eventually sold the building and went out of business.

Flea markets were held on the first floor in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Outerama, a company founded by Zenek Lapinsky in the late 1960s, continued to manufacture suits and jackets in the building until 1975 on the second and third floors. The bankruptcy of many of Outerama&#x27;s clients led to the company&#x27;s demise. The building was shuttered in 1976 and remained so for the next 25 years.

For nearly 20 years, the Borough of Neptune City sought to have the property revamped. In the early 1990s plans were underway to convert the building to retail shops and apartments, but funding was short, and the borough foreclosed on the owners before they could realize their goal. In 2000, the building was razed and condominiums were constructed. A demolition crane was destroyed when it fell into the side of the building during the wrecking operations.

The one and only motel in the Borough of Neptune City was the Charline Motel, located on Steiner Avenue.

==Transportation==

, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Monmouth County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

Route 35 passes directly through Neptune City, while Route 33 runs along the northern border of the borough. The Route 18 freeway is immediately west of the city, and both Interstate 195 and the Garden State Parkway are close by.

===Public transportation===
NJ Transit offers local bus service on the 836 route. Train service is available at the Bradley Beach station. Commuter service runs between New York City&#x27;s Pennsylvania Station and Bay Head on the North Jersey Coast Line.

== Climate change ==
Neptune City is projected to suffer substantial impacts from sea level rise caused by human-caused climate change, including a long-term loss of half its current population. Sea level rise has already resulted in flooding in Neptune City, with the period 2005–2014 experiencing 39 days of coastal flooding, over three times the average number of coastal flooding days for the decades between 1955 and 2004. In moderate sea level rise scenarios, Neptune City is projected to suffer a 68% chance risk of at least one major flood by 2050, and annual risk of flooding is projected to increase exponentially over the 21st century, with 100% risk of annual flooding for the years after 2100.

==Religion==
Neptune City had one church, the Memorial United Methodist Church. The building is now for sale.

<doc id="125499" wikidata="Q536154" url="?curid=125499" title="Ocean Grove, New Jersey">
<text>Ocean Grove is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) that is part of Neptune Township, in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. It had a population of 3,057 at the 2020 census, down from 3,342 in 2010. It is located on the Atlantic Ocean&#x27;s Jersey Shore, between Asbury Park to the north and Bradley Beach to the south. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Ocean Grove is noted for its abundant examples of Victorian architecture and for the Great Auditorium, acclaimed as &quot;the state&#x27;s most wondrous wooden structure, soaring and sweeping, alive with the sound of music.&quot;

Ocean Grove was founded in 1869 as an outgrowth of the camp meeting movement in the United States, when a group of Methodist clergymen, led by William B. Osborn and Ellwood H. Stokes, formed the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association to develop and operate a summer camp meeting site on the New Jersey seashore. By the early 20th century, the popular Christian meeting ground became known as the &quot;Queen of Religious Resorts&quot;. The community&#x27;s land is still owned by the Camp Meeting Association and leased to individual homeowners and businesses. Ocean Grove remains the longest-active camp meeting site in the United States.

==History==

In July 1869, Reverend W. B. Osborn, Reverend Stokes, and other Methodist ministers camped at a shaded, well-drained spot on New Jersey&#x27;s seashore and decided to establish a permanent Christian camp meeting community called &quot;Ocean Grove&quot;. This followed a search of the Jersey Shore for a place not infested with mosquitoes. About twenty tents were pitched that summer. In 1870, the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association was incorporated and land was purchased. The property was laid out into lots and roadways. The lots were leased for 99 years with the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association retaining ownership. Residents were expected to follow the strict Methodist social norms of the era which included prohibitions of alcohol, tobacco, cards, dancing, the reading of novels, and chewing gum. Nine wells were driven in 1870 to provide fresh water. The first was eventually named the &quot;Beersheba&quot; well, for an ancient well used by the Biblical patriarchs Abraham and Isaac. It is still in existence under a photogenic 1881 gazebo, though belatedly connected to the town water system in 1911.

Drawing from the major population centers of New York City and Philadelphia, Ocean Grove soon became a popular destination during the growth of the camp meeting movement in post-Civil War America. Tents and an open-air wooden shelter for speakers were erected in the 1870s, for the trainloads of visitors arriving by the New York and Long Branch Railroad after 1875. In 1877 alone, 710,000 railroad tickets were sold for the Ocean Grove-Asbury Park train station.
A third, larger auditorium was built in 1880.

As Ocean Grove drew more and more visitors, the facilities were outgrown, and construction of the present Great Auditorium was completed in 1894. Originally designed to accommodate crowds of as many as 10,000 people, the subsequent installation of theater-style cushioned seating in many sections reduced seating capacity to 6,250. It remains Ocean Grove&#x27;s most prominent structure and the centerpiece of its summer programs (see more about the Auditorium further down the page). By the early 20th century, said &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1986, it was called the &quot;Queen of Religious Resorts ... Visitors would travel miles to bask in the Victorian seaside splendor and to attend engaging, extroverted religious ceremonies. Millions of people, tourists and pilgrims both, made the trip to Ocean Grove every summer.&quot; The social disillusionment around 1920 following World War I had a profound effect on Ocean Grove and churchgoing in general. There was a decline in these activities and there was little in the way of new construction in the town after this time. One result was that Ocean Grove became a time capsule of late Victorian and early 20th century architecture.

Until Ocean Grove&#x27;s municipal authority was folded into Neptune Township in 1981, it had its own set of unique laws, including one that made it illegal on Sundays to have horses, wagons, then cars on the streets of Ocean Grove. This had a significant effect on the development of a close-knit community. People looking to get away for the weekend typically avoided the Grove (the beach was closed on Sunday, too). That meant the visitors were likely to be coming for a week-long visit or more. Most came to attend programs sponsored by the Camp Meeting.

President Ulysses S. Grant visited Ocean Grove during his time in office and made his last public appearance in this town. Other presidents to speak on the grounds included James Garfield, William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Richard Nixon. Heavyweight boxing champions James J. Corbett and Max Baer and department store magnate F.W. Woolworth were among the celebrities of the day who vacationed in Ocean Grove.

In 1975, Ocean Grove was designated a State and National Historic District as a 19th-century planned urban community. It has the most extensive collection of Victorian and early-20th century architecture in the United States. The Historical Society of Ocean Grove maintains a museum and a restored c. 1884 cottage in addition to offering walking tours.

During the 1960s–1980s, the town declined along with much of the Jersey Shore, and was pejoratively called &quot;Ocean Grave&quot; due to the general air of decrepitude and the elderly population. But beginning in the 1990s, and through 2006, Ocean Grove experienced a dramatic increase in property values and a considerable revival in fortune, particularly with the restoration of older hotel structures, many of which had deteriorated into single-room occupancy (&quot;SRO&quot;) quarters. As part of this resurgence, a number of sidewalk cafés and shops along Main Avenue (the main business thoroughfare) now cater to visitors and seasonal residents.

Plans were announced in 2006 for a major new hotel and condominium development on property which had been vacant since the 1970s, when the old North End Hotel – once Ocean Grove&#x27;s largest – was damaged by fire and subsequently demolished in 1980. These plans became controversial though, and in January 2008 the Planning Board of Neptune stated the North End Redevelopment Proposal was &quot;inconsistent with the town&#x27;s Master Plan&quot;. On April 13, 2019, the remaining structures on the North End were destroyed by fire, leaving the whole area vacant land.

In 2024, the OGCMA temporarily allowed Sunday access to its beach at weekday hours. This change in policy was made in the wake of legal threats by the NJDEP.

==Geography==
Ocean Grove is in southeastern Monmouth County, in the eastern part of Neptune Township. It is the only part of Neptune Township to touch the Atlantic Ocean. New Jersey Route 71 (South Main Street) forms the western edge of the community. Route 71 leads north into Asbury Park and to the southern part of Long Branch, while to the south it passes through Bradley Beach and leads less than to Belmar. New Jersey Route 33 has its eastern terminus at Route 71 on the western border of Ocean Grove. Route 33 leads west to Freehold, the Monmouth county seat, and to Trenton, the state capital.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Ocean Grove has an area of , including of land and of water (12.71%).

==Demographics==

Because Ocean Grove is a summer resort community and many residences are unoccupied during the winter months, these statistics may not be representative of the population at all times of the year.

===2010 census===

The 2010 United States census counted 3,342 people, 1,948 households, and 616 families in the CDP. The population density was . There were 3,132 housing units at an average density of .

===2000 census===
As of the 2000 United States census there were 4,256 people, 2,331 households, and 785 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 3,156 housing units at an average density of .

The per capita income for the CDP was $26,232. About 5.1% of families and 13.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.0% of those under age 18 and 5.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Governance==

The desire to develop a Christian seaside community for summer worship and relaxation led William B. Osborn (1832–1902), a leader of the camp meeting movement in mid-19th century America, to select the site of present-day Ocean Grove for its wooded, mosquito-free location. Ellwood H. Stokes (1815–1895), a Methodist minister from Philadelphia, and others joined to purchase a square mile of land fronting on the Atlantic Ocean. A state charter was issued to the newly formed Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association on March 3, 1870, granting the 26 trustees (13 ministers and 13 lay persons) the authority to purchase and hold one square mile of real estate comprising Ocean Grove (though Ocean Grove today is less than 0.5 square miles), and to construct and maintain all necessary works to supply the community with utilities and other municipal services, including law enforcement.

Later, efforts to establish a separate borough of Ocean Grove were attempted many times. Ocean Grove was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 5, 1920, from portions of Neptune Township, but the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals ruled the municipality unconstitutional on May 12, 1921, and the borough was dissolved as of June 16, 1921.

Although Ocean Grove reverted to being a part of Neptune Township with the court&#x27;s decision of 1921, the Camp Meeting Association continued to exercise local ordinance enforcement powers until 1981, when a newspaper deliverer successfully sued to end the resort&#x27;s blue law banning Sunday vehicular traffic and requiring it to disband its police force and &quot;municipal&quot; court. The Camp Meeting still owns all the land in town and leases it to homeowners and businesses for 99-year renewable terms. The Camp Meeting Association kept its beach closed on Sunday mornings until a court battle in 2024, and Ocean Grove is still &quot;dry&quot;, that is, the sale of all alcoholic beverages is prohibited.

==The Great Auditorium==
The Great Auditorium was constructed in 1894 and is mostly unchanged except for the front end that was extended for the 1908 Hope-Jones organ. The wooden building rests on bridge-like steel trusses laid on stone foundations. It features numerous &quot;barn door&quot; entrances with colored glass, dormers, and panels that open for ventilation. Originally, the Auditorium was claimed to hold an audience of almost 10,000. Many of smaller, wooden seats were replaced in later years with cushioned, theater-style seating, reducing capacity to an audience of 6,250 persons.

The Auditorium has been called, &quot;the state&#x27;s most wondrous wooden structure, soaring and sweeping, alive with the sound of music.&quot; Its superb acoustics, resulting from its barrel-vaulted wooden ceiling, have been widely acclaimed; famed conductor Leonard Bernstein once compared it to Carnegie Hall. In the days before electronic amplification, this allowed a preacher to be heard throughout the vast space. The building features a lighting system advanced for its time: arching rows of bulbs hanging from the varnished wood ceiling paneling. Also novel is a painted representation of a waving American flag (c. 1916 and rebuilt) covered with light bulbs that flash in an undulating manner. Illuminated signs, possibly the very oldest surviving examples of that type (1894), proclaim &quot;Holiness to the Lord&quot; and &quot;So be ye holy&quot;, a reflection of the emphasis at camp meetings. The illuminated Memorial Cross was placed on the Auditorium&#x27;s front façade at the end of World War II in 1946.

The hall is surrounded by 114 tents, which are occupied from May to September, as has been the case since 1869. Each tent is connected to a shed containing a kitchen and bathroom; the sheds are also used to store the tents during the winter. They are in such demand that there is a waiting list of some ten years for summer rentals.

===Organ===

The Auditorium&#x27;s pipe organ is the 17th largest in the world. Installed in 1908 by the organ builder Robert Hope-Jones, its components have been rebuilt and expanded several times, especially since resident organist Gordon Turk and curator John Shaw (who died on July 24, 2019) took their posts in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Additions made in the 21st century include a 14-rank echo division in 2008, in an effort to broaden the resources necessary to play repertoire of many styles and periods, and to restore those stops unique to the instrument as Hope-Jones conceived it. In the 2010s, the organ continued to be further enlarged and revoiced, with additions underwritten by donors. As of July 2018, the organ has five manuals, 202 ranks, and 12,200 total pipes. About 75 percent of the original Hope-Jones pipework remains extant, according to John Shaw.

Prominent organists to have played the Ocean Grove Auditorium organ include Edwin H. Lemare, Pietro Yon, and Frederick Swann. Celebrated organist Virgil Fox gave his last solo concert in the building in 1980. Turk and guest concert organists play free recitals on most Wednesday evenings and Saturday afternoons in July and August.

A popular organ piece, often played in the early years of the organ, was &quot;The Storm&quot;, which featured the stops of the organ for thunder, lightning, rain, and birds singing. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 1909 reports on the annoyance of some nearby residents at the frequent repetition of the performances of the piece.

===Performances and other events===
The Great Auditorium has over the years featured famed hymn writer Fanny Crosby, band leader John Philip Sousa, and tenor Enrico Caruso. More recently, singers Tony Bennett, Mel Tormé, Kenny Rogers, and Ray Charles have performed there. Other concerts filling the summer schedule have included the acclaimed &quot;Summer Stars&quot; chamber music programs, which bring some of the finest classical musicians from Philadelphia and New York each Thursday night in July and early August. Saturday nights have featured popular entertainment, including appearances by Johnny Mathis, Ronan Tynan, Linda Eder, the Beach Boys, comedian Bill Cosby, and Christian rock stars such as Michael W. Smith, Steven Curtis Chapman, Nichole Nordeman, Hillsong United, and Sonic Flood. In 2017, the CMA announced it would be cutting back on secular concerts in the Auditorium, and they have since been stopped altogether in favor of Christian programming, with the exception of classical and patriotic performances.
Since 1980, the Auditorium has hosted an annual memorial service for New Jersey law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. The service includes a full honor guard, bagpipe procession, and singing by state high school choirs (Princeton High School and both West Windsor-Plainsboro High School choirs have performed in the past). Police, soldiers, National Guardsmen, executive-level officials, and the governor typically attend.

The Auditorium is also used during the month of June for high school graduation ceremonies.

==Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association ==
The OGCMA was established in 1869 and incorporated in 1870. Its mission is to &quot;provide opportunities for spiritual birth, growth, and renewal in a Christian seaside setting.&quot;

===Tent City===
From May to September of each year, 114 tents are erected around the Great Auditorium. These tents form &quot;Tent City&quot;, a tradition of the Camp Meeting Association that dates back to 1869. Each tent is connected to a shed containing a kitchen and bathroom; the sheds are also used to store the tents during the winter. Tents are in such demand that there is a waiting list of over ten years for summer rentals. Rent runs from $4,000 to $6,000 per summer. All prospective tent inhabitants are interviewed. Subletting of tents is not allowed; dogs, cats, and barbecuing are also prohibited. Tent inhabitants do not have to be Methodist, but they do have to support the association&#x27;s spiritual missions.

===Programs===

The Camp Meeting offers traditional and contemporary worship programs throughout the summer. Sunday worship services are held in the Great Auditorium. These services have featured preachers such as Billy Graham, Norman Vincent Peale, Robert H. Schuller, Billy Sunday, Ralph W. Sockman, David H. C. Read, Frank Thewlis, Tony Campolo, James A. Forbes, D. James Kennedy, Charles Stanley, William Jennings Bryan, Booker T. Washington, and Rodney &quot;Gipsy&quot; Smith.

The music is led by a volunteer choir, along with professional soloists such as Ronald Naldi. Gordon Turk accompanies at the Hope-Jones organ. Jason Tramm is the musical director. Lewis A. Daniels Sr. (1927–2012) was director of music from 1966 to 2004. Since 1955, the annual Choir Festival held in July has gathered thousands of church choir singers, predominantly from the northeastern U.S., to sing &quot;to the glory of God&quot;. In 1986, New York television station WNET featured the Choir Festival on its &quot;Summerfare&quot; program. The Choir Festival is also a regular feature on the &quot;Sacred Classics&quot; radio broadcast.
The Camp Meeting also offers a contemporary worship service, &quot;Pavilion Praise&quot;, in the beach&#x27;s Boardwalk Pavilion each Sunday morning. A Bible Hour is held each weekday morning in the Bishop Janes Tabernacle, built in 1877, adjacent to the Great Auditorium.

&quot;Bridgefest&quot;, an annual two-day event, brings contemporary Christian music to young people and their families. The event is promoted by New York–area radio station &quot;Bridge FM&quot; (WRDR-FM).

==Hurricane Sandy==
In 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive damage in Ocean Grove. Over half of the town&#x27;s boardwalk was destroyed, and the town&#x27;s fishing pier was significantly damaged. Ocean Grove was denied Federal Emergency Management Agency funding because the Camp Meeting Association is a nonprofit organization. While nonprofit organizations are eligible to receive FEMA funding, Ocean Grove was denied funding because the boardwalk was classified as being used solely for recreational purposes. The town formed a group called &quot;Together&quot; to address storm recovery. The group includes the Camp Meeting Association, the chamber of commerce, the homeowners association, the beautification committee, the historic society, the fishing club, and Ocean Grove United, a gay and lesbian group.

Hurricane repairs were estimated to cost $3.5 million. The &quot;Together&quot; campaign raised $1.5 million, including $750,000 for the boardwalk, $100,000 for the roof of the Great Auditorium, and $500,000 for architectural and structural repairs to Thornley Chapel. The Camp Meeting Association appealed FEMA&#x27;s funding rejection three times. Federal officials also denied the Camp Meeting Association&#x27;s request for funding in the wake of Hurricane Irene.

In 2013, members of the gay-rights group Ocean Grove United and the OGCMA joined up to co-sponsor an event aimed at raising funds to rebuild Ocean Grove&#x27;s hurricane-damaged boardwalk.

The third appeal by OGCMA to FEMA, supported by some New Jersey politicians, was accepted. As MaryAnn Spoto elucidated on NJ.com in 2014: &quot;The storm destroyed about a third of Ocean Grove&#x27;s nearly half-mile of boardwalk... FEMA&#x27;s $2.3 million to Ocean Grove includes $1.13 million for that project as well as money for three other recovery projects.&quot;

==Gay relations==
From the late 1990s through 2000s, Ocean Grove saw the opening of a large number of gay-owned restaurants, hotels, and stores. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ocean Grove&#x27;s gay and Methodist populations coexisted peacefully until a 2007 controversy over whether gay couples could conduct civil unions at the Camp Meeting Association&#x27;s Boardwalk Pavilion. Previously, the Association sought to realize income from its structures by renting them as wedding venues. There were no religious restrictions placed on the ceremonies. Also according to the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Ocean Grove has long been considered a community that embraced gay residents.&quot; In 2007, a representative of Garden State Equality, an LGBT rights advocacy organization, said: &quot;I&#x27;m hearing from gay people all over the country who thought Ocean Grove was the leading light for gay tolerance and that&#x27;s not the case anymore.&quot;

In 2012, Christian actor Kirk Cameron gave a lecture in Ocean Grove on the subject of strengthening marriage. Cameron&#x27;s lecture sparked a protest by gay rights activists. After Cameron&#x27;s speech, a lunch was arranged between members of the Camp Meeting Association and members of the gay community. Camp Meeting Association President Dale Whilden said, &quot;This is an opportunity to show that we respect them.&quot; Democratic congressman Frank Pallone attended the event. Steven Goldstein of Garden State Equality noted: &quot;We may not agree on everything, but we are, today, starting to see each other as human beings.&quot;

In 2013, the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights advocacy group, included Ocean Grove in its Municipal Equality Index, a study that scores 291 American cities based on their inclusivity of LGBT people. Ocean Grove scored 77 out of 100, representing the second highest score for cities located in New Jersey.

In July 2022 the CMA unveiled the design for the new fishing pier, which had been destroyed by Hurricane Sandy, in the form of a cross. Some members of the LGBTQ+ and secular community were upset that neighborhood input was not sought before the plans were finalized and that the donors were not informed of the design ahead of time. They reached out to local and state officials hoping to delay the start of construction until the matter could be fully reviewed.

===Civil union controversy===
In 2007, two lesbian couples asked to have their civil union ceremonies at the OGCMA&#x27;s Boardwalk Pavilion. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;the couples&#x27; requests were rejected, and they complained to the state&#x27;s Division on Civil Rights, which began a discrimination investigation.&quot; The complaint stated that Scott Rasmussen, on behalf of the OGCMA, informed the couple it would not permit them to use the OGCMA&#x27;s facilities for a civil union. In 2008, the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights found that there was probable cause to credit one of the two couples&#x27; complaints, but rejected the other.

In an attempt to halt the state&#x27;s investigation, the OGCMA filed a federal suit. In the suit, the OGCMA wrote that it would be &quot;thrust into government compelled expressive association with those who promote same-sex &#x27;civil unions&#x27;&quot; if it is forced to allow them at its facilities, and &quot;such forced association would severely compromise the Association&#x27;s desire to communicate to the general public a message consistent with its religious views on marriage and family.&quot; The OGCMA&#x27;s motion was dismissed.

Complicating the dispute over civil unions was the fact that Ocean Grove&#x27;s boardwalk and beachfront were held in a 1908 ruling to be exempt from property tax because they &quot;had been dedicated years ago by the association as a public highway.&quot; The Boardwalk Pavilion lost its tax-exempt status in 2007 because the state ruled that it no longer met the requirements as a place open to all members of the public. From 1989 until the Pavilion lost its tax-exempt status, the OGCMA had received $500,000 in annual tax breaks through the state&#x27;s Green Acres program. The boardwalk and beach remain tax-exempt.

On January 12, 2012, Administrative Law Judge Solomon Metzger ruled that the Camp Meeting had violated the state&#x27;s law against discrimination. The OGCMA discontinued use of the pavilion for weddings for the general public after the controversy started. While the Association reports that it no longer offers any of its property to the general public as wedding venues, they have a process in place that grants use on an exception basis, provided the couple meets additional criteria.

==Government==

===Local government===

Oceanport is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Oceanport is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Oceanport Borough is Republican Thomas J. Tvrdik, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Patricia J. Cooper (R, 2025; elected to serve an unexpired term), William Deerin (R, 2027), Richard A. Gallo Jr. (R, 2026), Bryan Keeshen (R, 2026), Michael O&#x27;Brien (R, 2027) and Keith Salnick (R, 2025).

In January 2020, the borough council selected Bryan Keeshen from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that had been held by Robert F. Proto until he resigned after the November 2019 general election.

In the 2015 election, John F. &quot;Jay&quot; Coffey II was elected as a write-in candidate.

In a special meeting held in August 2015, the borough council selected Stuart Briskey from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by Council President Robert Lynch until his resignation from office the previous month. Briskey served on an interim basis until the November 2015 general election, when he was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

In March 2015, councilmember Jerry Bertekap resigned from office, leaving a vacancy in the term expiring December 2015. The borough council selected John Patti the following month to fill Bertekap&#x27;s vacant seat.

In November 2013, Christopher Paglia was selected by the borough council from among three candidates offered by the Republican committee and appointed to fill the vacant seat of William Johnson, who had resigned to take a position with Monmouth County.

The borough hall completed in 1965 at the intersection of Myrtle Avenue and Monmouth Boulevard was flooded out during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Following the storm, council meetings were held at the Maple Place Middle School library and other departments were scattered throughout Fort Monmouth and the borough&#x27;s senior center. A new municipal hall opened in Fort Monmouth in January 2021 consolidating the borough&#x27;s departments to one site. After being vacant for five years, the 1965 borough hall was demolished in 2017.

Oceanport is a participating municipality in an initiative to study regionalization of their municipal police force with one or more municipalities. The borough received a grant from the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs in the amount of $40,950 along with the Boroughs of Fair Haven, Little Silver, Shrewsbury and Rumson to hire professional consultants to conduct the study on their behalf. A report delivered in July 2008 recommended that Fair Haven, Little Silver and Rumson should consider a network of shared police services, with consideration of inclusion of Oceanport and Shrewsbury deferred to a second phase.

<doc id="125503" wikidata="Q636719" url="?curid=125503" title="Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>The flag of Newfoundland and Labrador was introduced in 1980 and was designed by Newfoundland artist Christopher Pratt. The flag design was approved by the House of Assembly of the province of Newfoundland, Canada, on May 28, 1980. It was flown for the first time on Discovery Day, June 24, 1980. The name of the province was changed to Newfoundland and Labrador by an amendment to the constitution of Canada in December 2001 at the request of the provincial legislature.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The design was chosen due to its broad symbolism. The blue (pantone 2955C) represents the waters of the sea, lakes and rivers; the white represents snow and ice; the red (pantone 200C) represents human effort, and the yellow gold (pantone 137C) symbolizes the confidence the people of Newfoundland and Labrador have in themselves and for the future.

The flag design is that of etchings on Beothuk and Innu decorative pendants worn hung from a cord around the neck. Pratt viewed these at the Provincial Museum. With the blue, red and white colours applied, the design has an intentional overall resemblance to the Union Jack, as a reminder of historic connections with the British Isles. The two red (pantone 200C) triangles represent the two areas of the province, Labrador the continental region and Newfoundland the insular region. The gold (pantone 137C) arrow, according to Pratt, points towards a &quot;brighter future&quot;; the arrow becomes a sword, honouring the sacrifices of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians in military service when the flag is displayed as a vertical banner. The red triangles and the gold arrow form a trident, symbolizing the province&#x27;s association with the fisheries and other resources of and under the sea.

==Newfoundland ensigns==

The Red Ensign was officially endorsed by King Charles II in 1674; this authorisation recognised it as the ensign of English merchant shipping. Later, during the Victorian era, the flag—with colonial badge—formed the basis as the Colony of Newfoundland&#x27;s civil ensign. Old oil paintings show red ensigns flying from the topmasts of Grand Banks schooners. While 19th century photographs show red ensigns flown at Moravian mission stations and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading posts along the Labrador Coast.

In 1904, the British Parliament designated a civil ensign specifically for Newfoundland. The Red and Blue Ensigns with the Great Seal of Newfoundland in the fly were the colony&#x27;s (later dominion)&#x27;s official flags from 1904 until 1931, after which the Union Jack was adopted as Newfoundland&#x27;s official national flag and the ensigns reserved for shipping and marine identification—the Red Ensign to be flown by merchant shipping while the blue was flown by governmental ships. Neither ensign was immediately formally adopted by the General Assembly of Newfoundland, which sat at the Colonial Building in St. John&#x27;s, when Newfoundland became a Dominion of the British Empire in 1907. It was not until the Newfoundland National Flag Act of 1931 that the Newfoundland parliament officially adopted the Union Jack as the national flag of Newfoundland and re-affirmed the red and blue ensigns as official flags for marine identification. Between 1907 and 1931, however, the red ensign gained wide enough use, both at sea and on land by civilians and government alike, that it was considered to be the national flag.

The badge in the ensigns consists of Mercury, the god of commerce and merchandise, presenting to Britannia a fisherman who, in a kneeling attitude, is offering the harvest of all the sea. Above the device in a scroll are the Latin words &#x27;Terra Nova&#x27;, and below the motto &quot;Hæc Tibi Dona Fero&quot; or &quot;These gifts I bring thee.&quot; The seal was redesigned by Adelaine Lane, niece of Governor Sir Cavendish Boyle.

==Union Flag==

The old flag of Newfoundland was the Union Flag. It was legally adopted in 1931 and used as Newfoundland&#x27;s national flag until confederation with Canada in 1949. It was then readapted as the official provincial flag in 1949 and used officially until 1980. The Newfoundland and Labrador branches of the Royal Canadian Legion to this day display the Union Flag along with the current Newfoundland and Labrador provincial and national (Canada maple leaf) flags.

==Newfoundland Tricolour==
The flag which has become known as the &quot;Newfoundland Tricolour&quot;, the &quot;Pink, White and Green&quot; (sic) began as the unofficial flag of an aid and benefit organization, the Newfoundland Fishermen&#x27;s Star of the Sea Association, which was established in St. John&#x27;s in 1871 by the Catholic Church. The official banner of the association was a green background with a white star and a pink cross in it. These colours gave rise to the green (at the hoist) white (in the centre) and pink (on the fly) tricolour flag which was more easily manufactured than the official banner. The flag has the proportions 1:2 with each vertical section occupying one-third of the flag length.

It exists in Canadian heraldry; its colours are present in the flag of the St. John&#x27;s Fire Department and in the municipal flag of Paradise, Newfoundland and Labrador. It also appears on the crests or escutcheons of some armorial bearings portrayed in the Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada. The first but unofficial flag of the Colony of Newfoundland (Island and Labrador) was the Red (at the hoist), White (centre) and Green (on the fly) tricolour of the Newfoundland Natives&#x27; Society (NNS) which was established in St. John&#x27;s in 1840 with subsequent branches in other locations. The Newfoundland Natives&#x27; Society was established to help native-born and other long-time residents of Newfoundland in dealings with colonial government officials, big business owners who were not always residents and the many newcomers to the colony who considered themselves to be much higher in social standing than the locals even though the vast majority of locals were of the same British Isles ancestry as the new arrivals. The red-white-green tricolour served as the unofficial national flag of Newfoundland from the mid to late 1800s. It fell into disuse after the Society stopped functioning in 1866. Responsible Government was established in 1855 and with it the need for the NNS waned. The NNS had campaigned for the introduction of Responsible Government.

===Origins===
The origins of the &quot;Pink, White and Green&quot; were obscure but recent scholarship has determined it was first used in the late 1870s or early 1880s by an aid and benefit organization, the Newfoundland Fishermen&#x27;s the Star of the Sea Association, which was established by the Roman Catholic Church in 1871. Polaris (the north star) was extremely important in navigation and is known as the Star of the Sea. Also in the Catholic Church, Mary, the mother of Jesus, is known as the &quot;Star of the Sea&quot; (in Latin &quot;Stella Maris&quot;). The flag became more widely used shortly thereafter, by other Catholic groups in St. John&#x27;s and the surrounding area. Given that, it was likely based on the similar flag of Ireland (then also unofficial). It is also said that the current Republic of Ireland flag is actually based on the &quot;Pink, White and Green&quot; tricolour but the Irish tricolour was in use long before 1871. Newspaper reports indicate a &quot;native flag&quot; was displayed in public ceremonies alongside the Union Jack when the Prince of Wales visited St. John&#x27;s in 1860, but that was the Native Flag of &quot;Red, White and Green&quot; rather than the &quot;Pink, White and Green&quot; (sic) since the Star of the Sea Association did not exist until 1871.

The green-white-pink tricolour flag was dismissed as a potential official flag when the British Parliament legislated a civil ensign for Newfoundland in 1904, which was a Red Ensign defaced with the Great Seal of Newfoundland. The great seal was used rather than the shield from the coat of arms since the coat of arms had been forgotten and its use was only reinstated after the First World War for use on war graves in Europe. The coat of arms has been in use since.

During the provincial flag debates of the 1970s an edition of the Roman Catholic archdiocese&#x27;s newsletter &quot;The Monitor&quot; revived the idea that the flag is symbolic of a tradition between local ethnically-English Protestants (represented by the pink) and ethnically-Irish Catholics (represented by the green). The vert was said to represent the flag of Brian Boru, the rose symbolized the Rose of England and the argent represented the peace between them, and the Cross of Saint Andrew. The claim that pink was representative of English Newfoundlanders was first made by R.C.Bishop Michael F Howley in his 1902 poem &quot;The Flag of Newfoundland&quot;. While the colour pink or rose is not directly representative of England or English Newfoundlanders it can evoke an image of a rose which is the floral emblem of England, although it is not a pink rose but the red and white Tudor rose. The Newfoundland Natives&#x27; Society, which was claimed in the legend as being a Protestant society which used a pink flag, actually contained Catholics as well as Protestants, including a Catholic president (Dr Edward Kielly) at the supposed time of the inception of the &quot;Pink, White and Green&quot;. Pink (rose) has never been used in any known fashion to represent England, its people or any of the Protestant denominations.

In another version of the legend, originating around 1900, it was claimed that the green represented newly arriving Irish settlers to Newfoundland and pink was again taken from the Natives&#x27; Society flag, but this time the Natives&#x27; Society was said to be a Roman Catholic group representing Catholics already living in Newfoundland. Protestants were not included at all. The latest interpretation of the supposed symbolism of the &quot;Pink, White and Green&quot; seems to have arisen in the 1970s during provincial flag debates in Newfoundland as an effort to gain Protestant support for an Irish-based flag - Protestants representing 60% of the province&#x27;s population - but it is unlikely to be a factual account of history. The flag gained a sentimental resurgence in the 1990s/2000s both as a political statement and on products aimed at the tourism industry.

==Flag of the ==

The flag of the is based on the French tricolour and Acadian flag, with three unequal panels of blue, white, and red. Two yellow sails are set on the line between the white and red panels. The sail on top is charged with a black spruce twig as seen on the Labrador flag. The black (bog) spruce is Newfoundland and Labrador&#x27;s official provincial tree. The bottom sail is charged with a pitcher plant, the official provincial flower of Newfoundland and Labrador. These emblems are outlined in black.

The sails represent early Basque, Breton, and French fishermen that came to the area in the early 1500s. At the same time, they are symbols of action and progress. The yellow is taken from the star of the Acadian flag. The black spruce and pitcher plant are official symbols of Newfoundland and Labrador. The black spruce twig on the flag of the is an emblem of Labrador and is also found on the Labrador flag. The flag&#x27;s colours of red, white, blue and yellow are also found in the provincial flag of Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Labrador flag==
The Labrador Flag was created by a small group led by Member of the House of Assembly for Labrador South Mike Martin in 1974. Martin et al did so as an act of political mischief aimed at Premier Joey Smallwood and his Liberal government&#x27;s perceived indifference to Labrador and the provincial government&#x27;s refusal to use anything other than the Union Jack as the provincial flag. The Labrador flag gave, at least, that part of the province its own distinctive flag. As Martin is from Cartwright, the town now proclaims itself the &quot;Birthplace of the Labrador Flag&quot;. The flag was presented to Labrador community councils, and to the Labrador members of the House of Assembly, in April 1974 and is six years older than provincial flag of Newfoundland and Labrador which was introduced in 1980 by the Progressive Conservative government of Premier Brian Peckford.

==Nunatsiavut flag==
The self-governing Inuit region of Nunatsiavut has its own flag: The flag of Nunatsiavut is the flag adopted by the Labrador Inuit Association to represent the Inuit of Labrador and their new Land Claims Settlement Area called Nunatsiavut. The flag features a traditional Inuit inukshuk coloured white, blue, and green, echoing the flag of Labrador.

Incorporated in 1908, the community is on the Navesink River, the area&#x27;s original transportation route to the ocean and other ports. Red Bank is in the New York metropolitan area and is a commuter town of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 12,936, an increase of 730 (+6.0%) from the 2010 census count of 12,206, which in turn reflected an increase of 362 (+3.1%) from the 11,844 counted in the 2000 census. In the 2020 census, Red Bank was the fourth-most densely populated municipality in Monmouth County.

Red Bank was formed as a town on March 17, 1870, from parts of Shrewsbury Township. On February 14, 1879, Red Bank became Shrewsbury City, part of Shrewsbury Township; this lasted until May 15, 1879, when Red Bank regained its independence. On March 10, 1908, Red Bank was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature and was set off from Shrewsbury Township. The borough was named for the red soil along the Navesink River.

Downtown Red Bank is notable for its many local and well-known businesses including Garmany, Urban Outfitters, and Tiffany &amp; Co. on and around Broad Street. Many annual events happen throughout the year, including the International Beer, Wine &amp; Food Festival, a long-running sidewalk sale, a farmers&#x27; market, an indie film festival, the Red Bank Guinness Oyster Festival, a Halloween parade, and a holiday town lighting.

==History==
Red Bank has been occupied by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The area of modern-day Red Bank was the territory of the Algonquian-speaking Lenape Native Americans, also called the Delaware by the English. The Lenape lived in the area between the Navesink River and the Shrewsbury River in an area they called &quot;Navarumsunk.&quot; The Native Americans traded freely with European settlers from England and the Dutch Republic in the mid-17th century, who purchased land in the area.

Originally part of &quot;Shrewsbury Towne&quot;, Red Bank was named in 1736, when Thomas Morford sold Joseph French &quot;a lot of over three acres on the west side of the highway that goes to the red bank&quot;. English colonists settled Red Bank beginning in the 17th century and it became a center for shipbuilding. Its population grew rapidly after 1809, when regularly scheduled passenger ships were established to serve the route to Manhattan.

By 1844, Red Bank had become a commercial and manufacturing center, focused on textiles, tanning, furs, and other goods for sale in Manhattan. With the dredging of the Navesink River about 1845, Red Bank became a port from which steamboats transported commuters to work in Manhattan. Red Bank grew in size as a result, and because the Raritan and Delaware Bay Railroad constructed a railway in the town in 1860.

In the 20th century, Red Bank was a strong cultural, economic, and political center in Monmouth County until it was hindered by the economic recession that began in 1987. During this time, its economy, based largely on retail commerce, was in decline, due to a real estate scandal. Local pundits and urban planners referred to the town as &quot;Dead Bank&quot;.

Beginning in approximately 1991, under the New Jersey Development and Redevelopment Law, the borough authorized the creation of the Red Bank RiverCenter to manage redevelopment in what was designated as a special improvement district. RiverCenter retains authority over the management and redevelopment of a defined central business district, which includes Broad Street from the post office to Marine Park and from Maple Avenue to one block east of Broad Street. A number of urban redevelopment projects have taken place, including improved signage, distinctive and pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and lighting, a coherent design plan for Main Street and other major thoroughfares, and improving the condition of parking lots with landscaping.

The district as originally proposed was larger, to include the commercial areas west of Maple Avenue, including the antique buildings, The Galleria, and Shrewsbury Avenue. But some property owners in this area opposed paying the special assessment. Plans for the larger district advanced but opposition became more rigorous. The proposed district was amended to exclude opponents, and the district that was adopted stops at Maple Avenue.

==Geography==

<text>Roosevelt is a borough in western Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 808, a decrease of 74 (−8.4%) from the 2010 census count of 882, which in turn reflected a decline of 51 (−5.5%) from the 933 counted in the 2000 census.

Located at the cross-roads between the Delaware Valley region to the south and the Raritan Valley region to the north in the center of the state, the borough was established as Jersey Homesteads by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 29, 1937, from portions of Millstone Township. The name was changed to Roosevelt as of November 9, 1945, based on the results of a referendum held three days earlier, in honor of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died on April 12, 1945.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Roosevelt as its 12th best place to live in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

==History==

Roosevelt was originally called Jersey Homesteads, and was created during the Great Depression as part of President Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, its main purpose being to resettle Jewish garment workers. The town was conceived as an integrated cooperative project, with farming, manufacturing, and retail all on a cooperative basis. The project fell under the discretion of the Resettlement Administration, but was conceived and largely planned out by Benjamin Brown.

Farmland in Central Jersey was purchased by Jersey Homesteads, Inc., a corporation owned by the federal government but under control of a board of directors selected by Brown. Construction started around 1936. Soon after there were 200 homes and various public facilities in place. The economy of the town consisted of a garment factory and a farm. Objectives of the community were to help residents escape poverty, to show that cooperative management can work, and as an experiment in government intervention.

Albert Einstein gave the town his political and moral support. Artist Ben Shahn lived in the town and painted a fresco mural viewable in the current Roosevelt Public School. The three panels show the history of the Jersey Homesteads, starting with the eastern European origins of its Jewish residents, their passage through Ellis Island and making plans for the community in Roosevelt.

David Dubinsky and the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union opposed the project, arguing that the factory town would cause unions to lose their power over wages. Political opposition came from those who thought too much money was being spent on the project, as well as those opposed to the New Deal in general.

The Jersey Homesteads cooperative didn&#x27;t last through World War II. It failed for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons for its failure is because of delays in housing construction and resulted of shortage in workers in the garment factory. They ended up going on strike against themselves and the Farm Security Administration declared it a failure in 1939 and tried to auction off the assets. By early 1940, having failed to auction the factory fixtures, negotiations with Kartiganer and Co. succeeded and the company began operations at the Jersey Homesteads factory. Proving to be no more economically successful than the factory, the settlement&#x27;s agricultural cooperative ceased operations in 1940. Although the clothing store failed with the factory, the borough&#x27;s cooperative grocery and meat market endured into the 1940s. According to town expert Michael Hiltzik another reason it failed is &quot;It was very, very expensive, and the agricultural progress that New Dealers thought they&#x27;d make, and certainly the industrial gains they thought they would see, never really materialized&quot; 

Roosevelt is a historic landmark and is the subject of the 1983 documentary, &quot;Roosevelt, New Jersey: Visions of Utopia&quot;. The Jersey Homesteads Historic District was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, including &quot;all that area within the corporate boundaries of the Borough of Roosevelt&quot;.

==Government==

===Local government===
Roosevelt is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Roosevelt is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Roosevelt is Democrat Peggy Malkin, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. The members of the Roosevelt Borough Council are Council President Joseph E. Trammell (D, 2026), Robert Atwood (D, 2024), Louis Esakoff (D, 2026), Danelle Feigenbaum (D, 2025; appointed to serve an unexpired term), Constance Herrstrom (D, 2025), Kristine Kaufman-Marut (D, 2027) and Ralph Warnick (D, 2027).

In June 2021, the borough council selected Constance Herrstrom from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2022 that had been held by Luke D. Dermody until he resigned from office. Herrstrom served on an interim basis until the November 2021 general election when she was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

In August 2017, Mayor Jeff Ellentuck (whose term was to expire in December 2019), Council President Stacey Bonna (in 2017) and Councilwoman Jill Lipoti (2018) all resigned, citing conflicts between factions of the Democratic Party in the borough. Councilmember Michael L. Ticktin, who had been elected to serve an unexpired term of office expiring in 2018, presented his resignation as Councilmember on August 19, leaving the three remaining councilmembers without the quorum needed to conduct official business. As in all such cases where there is an insufficient number of elected officials, Governor Chris Christie will have 30 days to appoint replacements to fill the vacancies.

Citing infighting on the council, Mayor Jeff Ellentuck, and councimembers Stacey Bonna and Jill Lipoti resigned in August 2017 and when councilmember Michael Ticktin resigned less than a week later, the governing body was left without a quorum. As specified by state law in such circumstances, Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie selected registered Democrats Robin Middleman Filepp, Nicholas Murray and Maureen S. Parrott to fill the vacant seats, from applications submitted by borough residents. In the November 2017 general election, Peggy Malkin was elected to serve the two years remaining on the mayoral term and Robin Filepp and Deirdre Sheean were elected to one-year vacancies on the borough council.

In February 2015, the borough council selected Jill Lipoti to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2017 of Michelle Hermelee, who had resigned earlier that month due to work demands.

In 2006, more than 80% of Roosevelt voters supported the recall of Neil Marko, the borough&#x27;s mayor, by a vote of 282–68, in an effort initiated by the Committee to Recall Marko. Voters chose Beth Battel, then the borough council&#x27;s president, to replace Marko as mayor. The recall election was part of a larger controversy regarding a local yeshiva, a school for Jewish boys, that had been permitted to operate in a local synagogue by Mayor Marko, who was also the congregation&#x27;s president. While supporters of the yeshiva, including Mayor Marko, described the opposition as &quot;thinly veiled prejudice&quot;, a local historian described the recall as reflecting &quot;not so much anti-Semitism as anti-Orthodox feelings&quot;.

===Federal, state, and county representation===
Roosevelt is located in the 3rd Congressional District and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s 12th state legislative district.



===Politics===

Roosevelt is a historically Democratic jurisdiction in the state of New Jersey. Since the first presidential election after its incorporation as Jersey Homesteads, all 21 Democratic party nominees for president have carried the borough by a margin of 25 points or greater, even in the nationwide Republican landslides of 1956, 1972, and 1984 that saw New Jersey vote Republican by over 20 points, and Monmouth County vote Republican by over 30 points.

The highest percentage of the vote won by a Democratic presidential candidate is the 94.68% of the vote won by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1944. Roosevelt in 1940, as well as Lyndon Johnson in 1964 also won over 90% of the vote for the Democrats. The highest percentage of the vote won by a Republican presidential candidate is the 36.11% of the vote won by Ronald Reagan in 1984.

Similarly, all 23 Democratic party nominees for governor of New Jersey since 1937 have carried Roosevelt with three campaigns, Robert B. Meyner in 1953 and 1957, and Brendan Byrne in 1973 each breaking 90% of the vote for the party. Meyner&#x27;s 1957 campaign which garnered 93.52% being the largest total won by any gubernatorial candidate in Roosevelt since the borough&#x27;s incorporation. The best showing by a Republican gubernatorial nominee was the 46.13% received by Thomas Kean in 1985. In that election, Roosevelt was one of only three municipalities (along with Audubon Park, and Chesilhurst) in the entire state of New Jersey that supported Peter Shapiro.

Melvin H. Kreps Middle School with 1,194 students in grades 6–8 and
Hightstown High School with 1,621 students in grades 9–12.

From 2005 to 2010, a Jewish secondary and post-secondary religious school, Yeshiva Me&#x27;on Hatorah, was located in a local synagogue, Congregation Anshei Roosevelt. Due to unresolvable zoning issues for its dormitory and dining facilities, and local opposition to its presence, the yeshiva relocated to Monsey, New York, after the yeshiva brought and lost several actions against the borough and certain individual borough officials in state and Federal courts.
