<text>Howell is the largest city in and county seat of Livingston County, Michigan, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 10,068. The city is mostly surrounded by Howell Township, but the two are administered autonomously. Howell is part of the South Lyon–Howell–Brighton urban area, which is an extension of the larger Detroit–Warren–Dearborn (Metro Detroit) metropolitan statistical area. As of 2022, the largest industries were manufacturing, health care &amp; social assistance, and accommodation &amp; food services.

==History==
January 1836 saw the establishment of the first post office. Flavius J. B. Crane was postmaster, and the post office was in the Eagle Tavern. In March of this same year, there was a mail route started in the village of Kensington that went through Howell until ending in Grand Rapids. The pioneer manufacturing enterprise of Howell was a sawmill built in 1836, soon followed by a blacksmith shop.

The City of Howell is the county seat of Livingston County. On 24 March 1836, the legislature passed an act organizing Livingston County. Howell was slated to become the county seat, but the newly established Brighton nearby claimed the seat for the next 12 years.

The town was originally called Livingston Center, formed as a village by an act of the legislature on 14 March 1863 consisting of sections 35 and 36, and the south half of sections 25 and 26 of Howell Township.

===20th century===
The Howell Home Rule City Charter was adopted in 1955.

The Ku Klux Klan first took hold in the area in the 1920s, and membership in Livingston County increased during the American civil rights era. Since the 1970s, Howell has had a national reputation for being associated with the Klan. White supremacist leader and Michigan Grand Dragon (1971–1979) Robert E. Miles held gatherings on his farm 12 miles north of the city in Cohoctah Township. Miles died in 1992, but the gatherings, including the burning of crosses, continued.

The Livingston Diversity Council, founded in response to a 1988 cross burning on the lawn of a Black family, has been promoting diversity and inclusion in the county. While they are numerous in Metro Detroit, as of 2011, Howell was not listed as an active home to any hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

On October 22, 1994, less than a dozen Ku Klux Klansmen from outside Howell held a rally on the steps of the historic Livingston County Courthouse. According to a reporter for the &quot;Livingston Post&quot;, the town may have been chosen because of its reputation for intolerance. Ben Bohnsack, the pastor of the First United Methodist Church in nearby Brighton, Michigan, at the time, described the approaching rally as an &quot;assault on the values&quot; of the community. On the day of the rally, the courthouse was put under the protection of 174 police officers from every law enforcement agency in the county. An 8-foot-tall chain-link fence was erected around the courthouse, with two additional sections raised on Grand River Avenue to contain protesters and observers. The fence was dismantled after the rally, and on the following day, citizens assembled with brooms, mops, and buckets for a symbolic cleansing of the courthouse steps.

===21st century===
Activities associated with the Ku Klux Klan persisted into the 2000s, with events such as a public auction of Klan items scheduled for Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday in January 2005, the 2010 suspension of a teacher who removed students for wearing a Confederate flag and making anti-gay slurs, and students&#x27; racist tweets toward a racially mixed team in 2014.

On October 5, 2021, President Joe Biden visited Howell for a speech to build support for his Build Back Better Plan.

On July 21, 2024, about a dozen masked white supremacists marched through downtown Howell, chanting &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; and carrying signs with messages such as &quot;White Lives Matter&quot; and &quot;End the War on White Children&quot;. They began their demonstration on the lawn of the Livingston County courthouse, where, in 1994, members of the community symbolically scrubbed the steps following a Klan rally. Several miles east of Howell at the Latson Road/I-96 overpass in Genoa Township, Michigan, pictures posted to a community Facebook group showed demonstrators hanging Klan and Nazi flags over the side of the overpass. One of the photos showed them with a Donald Trump flag, while the &quot;Livingston Post&quot; uploaded a video made by a passerby in which one of the protestors is heard saying, &quot;We love Hitler. We love Trump.&quot; On July 28, 2024, one week after the white supremacist march, at an anti-white supremacist counterprotest in downtown Howell, residents cleansed the sidewalk to symbolically wash away the racism. On August 20, 2024, Donald Trump visited Howell for a campaign speech.

<text>Unadilla Township is a civil township in the southwest corner of Livingston County, Michigan, United States. The population was 3,333 at the 2020 census.

==Communities==
There are no incorporated municipalities in the township. There are a few unincorporated communities and historic locales. 
*Bullis Crossing is at Barton Road and M-36 (). 
*Gregory began as a station on a branch of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, which came through the farm of Halstead Gregory in 1884. He built a store near the depot and became the first postmaster in March 1884. The Township Hall is located at 126 Webb Street in Gregory.
*Kaiserville is located on the west side of Patterson Lake at Kaiser Road and Woodside Drive ().
*Plainfield was the nexus of many Indian trails and a favorite Indian camping ground. Jacob Dunn and Levi Clawson, both from Newton, New Jersey, were the first to purchase land here in 1835 and to then settle. Philip Dyer, also from New Jersey, joined them in 1836. Both Dunn and Dyer operated taverns. The community was at first known as &quot;Dyersburg&quot;, but the name of the post office, &quot;Plainfield&quot;, was chosen in April 1837 by Dunn, after Plainfield, New Jersey. The post office operated until October 1913.
*Unadilla was at first known as &quot;Milan&quot;. A post office was established in June 1834, but because Milan, Michigan, already had the name, the post office was called &quot;Unadilla&quot; after the township. But a plat had already been recorded for the &quot;Village of Unadilla&quot; in what is now Williamsville, so the plat was recorded as the Village of East Unadilla. This became known as simply &quot;Unadilla&quot; after the other village of Unadilla was abandoned. A survey for the plat was made on April 14, 1837, by Richard Peterson, Jr., but it was not recorded by the proprietors Robert Glenn and Thomas S. Gill until April 21, 1840.
*Williamsville, situated northeast of Williamsville Lake, was at first platted as the Village of Unadilla on January 30, 1837, by Darwin N. Edson and the heirs of Curtis Noble. This plat for the east half of the east half of the southwest quarter of section 28 was vacated by an act of the state Legislature on March 25, 1846. The area later became known as Williamsville.

==History==
Unadilla was formed by an act of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Michigan on March 26, 1835, and initially included what is now Iosco Township to the north and a portion of Lyndon township in Washtenaw County on the south. The first township meeting was held on the first Monday of April 1835. Since Livingston County government was not organized until 1836, the township was at first attached to Washtenaw County. On March 6, 1838, Iosco Township was set off and with the southern portion being assigned to Lyndon Township, Unadilla assumed its present boundaries.

The first land purchase in the township was recorded on June 20, 1833, by Eli Ruggles of Brookfield, Connecticut, while accompanied by his brother-in-law, Amos Williams, and Nathaniel Noble, an acquaintance who lived nearby in Dexter. After returning to Connecticut, Ruggles became ill and died. Williams returned to the land in the fall of 1833 with his son Samuel, son-in-law Gary Briggs, and Briggs&#x27; wife. The land purchase was recorded as the north half of the northwest quarter of section 33, which would have been , but in subsequent accounts was frequently described as . During that winter the Williams and family built a sawmill, which began operations in the spring of 1834.

<text>Bois Blanc Township ( ) is a civil township of Mackinac County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 100 at the 2020 census. The insular township occupies Bois Blanc Island, as well as some smaller outlying islands within Lake Huron. The nearby Round Island is administered by the city of Mackinac Island.

The township is served by Bois Blanc Pines School District, which is the smallest school district in terms of enrollment in the state of Michigan and among the nation. The district had an enrollment of four students for the 2021–22 school year.

==History==

&quot;Bois Blanc&quot; is French for &quot;white wood&quot;. The name is commonly thought to be a reference to either: (a) the paper birch, or more likely (b) the basswood, called &quot;bois blanc&quot; in other contexts. The basswood&#x27;s white underbark was extensively used by Native Americans and French-speaking fur traders for cordage, including the sewing up of canoes and the manufacture of webbing for snowshoes. Bois Blanc is in the traditional lands of the Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians.

Bois Blanc was ceded by the local Anishinaabe (Chippewa) to the U.S. federal government with the Treaty of Greenville in 1795 by Chippewa Chief Menehwehna. After extensive use as a source of kilned lime and firewood for Mackinac Island and other local frontier settlements, Bois Blanc was settled in the late 1800s as a summer resort community. The Bois Blanc Light lighthouse (1867) survives on the northern shore of the island; it is no longer in service as a lighthouse and is not open to the public.
==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (27.94%) is water.

The township is located on the eastern end of the Straits of Mackinac directly north of the city of Cheboyan. It is politically and geographically part of the state&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. While the rest of the Upper Peninsula uses the area code 906, Bois Blanc Township is the only municipality in the Upper Peninsula that uses the area code 231. Bois Blanc Township is one of only seven municipalities in the state of Michigan to consist entirely of islands, including Grosse Ile Township, Drummond Township, St. James Township, Mackinac Island, Peaine Township, and Sugar Island Township.

The township should not be confused with another Bois Blanc Island, which is a Canadian island in the Detroit River much further to the south. That island is also nicknamed &quot;Boblo.&quot;

=== Communities ===

It was briefly closed from October 25, 1889 until being restored on May 29, 1890. The name comes from French translation for its location in the pine forest area. The Pointe Aux Pins post office uses the 49775 ZIP Code that serves an area conterminous with the township. It is the only post office for the township, while the name Bois Blanc Island can also be used for mail delivery.

<text>Brevort Township is a civil township of Mackinac County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the population was 502, down from 594 in 2010.

The township was named after Henry Brevort (or Brevoort), a surveyor assigned to subdivide the area in 1845. Most of the township land is within the eastern portion of the Hiawatha National Forest. The township includes part of the Mackinac Wilderness.

==Geography==
The township is in central Mackinac County, bordered to the west and south by Moran Township and to the east by St. Ignace Township. It is bordered to the north by Trout Lake Township in Chippewa County. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Brevort Township has a total area of , of which are land and (6.43%) are water.

Highway M-123 passes diagonally southeast–northwest through the township, and U.S. Route 2 and Interstate 75 are just outside of the township boundaries to the south and east.

=== Communities ===
* Allenville was a station on the Detroit, Mackinac and Marquette Railroad less than one mile southeast of Moran at . It was founded by J. Alley, head of the Alley Lumber Company in 1873. A post office operated from December 1873 until October 1891. Also known as &quot;Alley Town&quot;, the community was almost destroyed by fire in 1882.
* Moran is an unincorporated community on M-123 at approximately northwest of St. Ignace. Confusingly, the community is not a part of Moran Township, which is adjacent to Brevort Township on the south and west. It was initially called &quot;Jacob City&quot;, after the president of the German Land Company of Detroit, which sold land to members in 1881–83. In 1883, Jacob was accused of fraud and ousted from the organization. Another member of the group, William B. Moran, loaned the group funds to buy additional land, and the settlement was renamed after him in 1883. A post office named &quot;Jacob City&quot; was established in February 1882 and renamed &quot;Moran&quot; in January 1883. The office was transferred to and renamed &quot;Allenville&quot; in April 1898, but a Moran post office was re-established in May 1910. The name of Moran Township and other nearby places named Moran such as East Moran Bay in St. Ignace, West Moran Bay on Lake Michigan, and the Moran River all have a different origin, and instead derive from the French &quot;Morin&quot;.

The name, French for &quot;place of rest&quot;, was given by early French settlers because it was believed that Father Jacques Marquette used the harbor as the first step on his trip down Lake Michigan from St. Ignace. A historical marker commemorating the fishing village was erected in 1986. A summer post office operated here from 1959 to 1965 and 1966–1972.
*Fiborn Quarry was a settlement around a limestone quarry.

<text>Mackinac Island ( , ) is a city in Mackinac County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 583.

Established as an important fur trading center in the eighteenth century, with a predominately French-speaking population of French Canadians and Métis, after the War of 1812 the city gained more Anglo-American residents. The US put restrictions on Canadians for fur trading. From 1818 until 1882, the city served as the county seat of the former Michilimackinac County, which was later organized as Mackinac County, with St. Ignace designated as the county seat. The city includes all of Mackinac Island and also nearby Round Island which is unpopulated, federally owned and part of the Hiawatha National Forest. The state park and the national forest make up most of the city.

A unique local ordinance passed in 1895 prohibits the use of any motor vehicles on the island. The only exceptions to this are city emergency vehicles (ambulance, police cars and fire trucks), city service vehicles and snowmobiles in the winter. Today the most common means of travel is by foot, bicycle, horse or horse-drawn carriage. Roller skates and roller blades are also allowed, except in the downtown area. Mackinac Island is home to the Grand Hotel, built during the late nineteenth century when the island started to be a summer destination. When the 1980 movie &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; was filmed here, the city made an exception to allow the production company to use motorized vehicles on the island.

==History==
Andrew Blackbird was the son of an Ottawa chief and served as an official interpreter for the U.S. government in the late 19th century. According to his 1887 history of the indigenous peoples of Michigan, the people of Mackinac Island had been a small independent tribe known as &quot;Mi-shi-ne-macki naw-go&quot;. They became affiliated with the larger tribe of Ottawa from Ottawa Island (now Manitoulin Island) situated north of Lake Huron.

One winter the Mi-shi-ne-macki naw-go on Mackinac were nearly annihilated by the Seneca, the westernmost nation of the Iroquois Confederacy, then based in present-day New York and Pennsylvania. Two natives escaped by hiding in one of the natural caves on the island. To commemorate this tribe, the Ottawa and Chippewa (Ojibwe) named the island as &quot;Mi-shi-ne-macki-nong,&quot; also known as &quot;Michilimackinac&quot; (meaning &quot;Great Turtle&quot;) by the 18th century.

In 1654 French Jesuit missionaries recorded French traders at the island, who were with a large party of Huron and Ottawa heading to Three Rivers. Another trader was said to have made a canoe voyage to the island in 1665. The French colonists continued in the fur trade, which became extremely lucrative; they operated out of Montreal and Quebec, and established posts on &quot;Mi-shi-ne-macki-nong&quot; and throughout the Great Lakes area. After the French ceded their territory in North America to the British in 1763 following defeat in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the British established Fort St. Joseph and an installation on what was known as Michilimackinac. During the American Revolutionary War, they vacated the fort.

By 1782, the Americans established a garrison on what they called Mackinac Island, commanded by Captain Daniel Robertson; he had command until his death in 1787. In 1796 as a result of Jay&#x27;s Treaty with Great Britain, settling the northern border, the island officially became part of the United States and its Northwest Territory.

In the early 1800s Mackinac Island had a permanent population of about 250. Although it was part of the United States, most of the residents were of French-Canadian and Métis ancestry, based on its colonial history, and French was the predominant language. The fur trade was the dominant feature of the economy. Native American languages, particularly Ojibwe and Odawa, and dialects were spoken by some residents. In the summer trading season, the population could reach 4,000, attracting agents and Native Americans from the interior.

After the War of 1812, the United States prohibited British fur traders from operating in US territory, cutting off some of the relations between Canadians and Native Americans on the US side. Some fur trading families divided their operations with posts on each side of the border. The noted French writer Alexis de Tocqueville visited Mackinac Island in July 1831 on his tour of the United States. He wrote about its unique population with its strong French and Native American influence.

Under American rule, Michilimackinac (the island and adjacent areas) had a justice of the peace, supervisor of roads, and two military captains until the borough was formed. The island&#x27;s people made a request through Indian Agent William Henry Puthuff on February 2, 1817, that a borough be established on the island and for building a jailhouse. In response on March 15, 1817, Michigan Territory Secretary William Woodbridge issued a proclamation forming the Township of Michilimackinac, giving the jurisdiction&#x27;s distance from Detroit, the territorial capital. The governor and judges passed an act on April 6, 1817, forming the Borough of Michilimackinac. The borough organizational meeting was held in the Indian Council House, presided over by Puthuff on Monday, July 7, 1817. (The site was within the boundaries of the current Marquette Park). At this meeting, the residents selected the following officers, a warden, two burgesses, a clerk, a marshal and a treasurer. Puthuff was selected as warden, the chief official similar to a mayor. The American Fur Company was formed on Main Street, now Market Street.

With the 1818 formation of Michilimackinac County by Territorial Governor Lewis Cass, this borough was named as the county seat. The Borough form was later replaced with that of a village. Waren Puthuff was authorized by borough act to build a wharf at the end of Cross Street, now named Astor Street after John Jacob Astor. This wharf is the longest-lasting wharf on the island and was later used as the coal dock.

On March 16, 1847, the Michigan state legislature passed a law abolishing the borough, effective April 1. The legislature reversed this action and incorporated the island as the Village of Mackinac, effective March 25, 1847.

In the late 19th century, Mackinac Island became a popular summer resort destination for travelers from major cities such as Chicago and later Detroit, as well as more distant ones. The Grand Hotel was built as a luxury venue. The seasonal peak of population in the summer, now made up of thousands of tourists and service workers, follows the earlier cycle of the fur trade. As then, it is a time of festivities and entertainment.

In 1860, the &quot;Augustus Pond vs. The People&quot; court case was held in the county courthouse. It clarified the self-defense legal principle informally expressed as “a man’s home is his castle.” Hubbard&#x27;s Annex was platted on the former Ambrose Davenport farm west of the harbor in 1882 by Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard. The county seat was moved from the municipality in 1882 to St. Ignace, as more population had moved into the western part of the county.

Personal motor vehicles were banned in 1895 in order to protect the health of the island horses and residents. Soon after the first automobiles made their way onto the island, members of Mackinac Island Carriage Tours petitioned the Village of Mackinac Island to ban the automobile as the &quot;dangerous horseless carriage&quot; startled the horses. This ban remains in effect today with only exceptions being city emergency vehicles (ambulance, police cars and fire trucks), city service vehicles and snowmobiles in winter.

The Michigan Legislature created the City of Mackinac Island on June 9, 1899, via act 437 as a special charter city, combining the Township of Holmes and Village of Mackinac. At that time, all of nearby Round Island was included in the corporate limits, for reasons not clear today.

Round Island is owned and overseen by the United States Forest Service in its entirety, and is managed as part of the Round Island Wilderness Area and the Hiawatha National Forest. The city limits include all of Mackinac Island State Park, which area makes up 82 percent of Mackinac Island; it is governed by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The City of Mackinac Island exists on the island of the same name, and it also nominally includes the entirety of nearby Round Island, situated in the Straits of Mackinac immediately to the south, which is uninhabited, and is owned and overseen by the United States Forest Service in its entirety, and is managed as part of the Round Island Wilderness Area and the Hiawatha National Forest.

While all of Mackinac Island, the landform, is located within the corporate limits of the City of Mackinac Island, today 82 percent of the island&#x27;s landmass is owned by the State of Michigan and managed by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission (MISPC). The city has direct jurisdiction over only 18 percent of the island. The City and the Commission work together on the many issues affecting both the City and the State Park, such as the longtime ban on motorized vehicles on the island.

Access to the island is by ferries across Lake Huron. The city of Mackinac Island is one of seven municipalities in the state of Michigan to consist entirely of islands, including Grosse Ile, Drummond, Bois Blanc, St. James, Peaine, and Sugar Island townships.

Mackinac Island is encircled by M-185, a state highway that is only accessible to pedestrians, bicyclists, and horse-drawn vehicles, as cars are banned on the island. In downtown Mackinac Island, the highway is known as &quot;Main Street&quot;, while elsewhere it is known as &quot;Lake Shore Road&quot;.

===Neighborhoods===
*Harrisonville, also referred to as &quot;the village&quot;, is a neighborhood of the city just past the Grand Hotel and up a hill.
*Hubbard&#x27;s Annex is a summer cottage subdivision and historical district west of the harbor platted in 1882 by Gurdon Saltonstall Hubbard. The plans included a public park referred to as the Commons and a community building lot for the Eating House. Francis B. Stockbridge purchased a cottage on the bluff top in 1882, where the Dziabis cottage is now located.

<text>St. Ignace ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan and the county seat of Mackinac County. The city had a population of 2,306 at the 2020 census. St. Ignace Township is located just to the north of the city; the two are administered separately.

St. Ignace is located along Lake Huron in the Upper Peninsula on the northern side of the Straits of Mackinac. The city serves as a gateway to the state&#x27;s Upper Peninsula for travelers coming from the Lower Peninsula, as the city is at the north end of the Mackinac Bridge, opposite Mackinaw City. It has one of two ports which provide ferry service to nearby Mackinac Island.

St. Ignace&#x27;s history dates back to 1671 when French Jesuit priests founded the St. Ignace Mission, which makes it one of the oldest European settlements in the state after Sault Ste. Marie. The area was previously inhabited by the Wyandot people, as well as the Ojibwe and Ottawa tribes of Native Americans. St. Ignace soon became the center of fur trading with the French. It was incorporated as a village in 1882 and a city in 1883. The Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians is headquartered at St. Ignace, and the city continues to have a high population of Native Americans.

==History==


St. Ignace is the second-oldest city founded by Europeans in Michigan. Various cultures of Native Americans had inhabited the area for thousands of years before the first exploration here by French colonists. Early historic peoples of the area in the 17th century were predominantly the Iroquoian-speaking &quot;Wendat&quot;, whom the French called the &quot;Huron.&quot;

By the early 18th century, the &quot;Anishinaabe&quot; &quot;Ojibwe,&quot; who spoke one of the Algonquian languages, became prominent in the region. Another related Anishinaabe people were the Ottawa or &quot;Odawa&quot; in their language. The third member of the Council of Three Fires, a loose confederacy of these tribes, was the Potawatomi people. All three peoples have descendants who are members of various federally recognized tribes in northern Michigan.

French explorer and priest Jacques Marquette founded the St. Ignace Mission on this site in 1671 and was buried here after his death. He named it for St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit religious order, whose priests were active as missionaries across North America. (&quot;Ignace&quot; is the French version of Ignatius.) Jesuits served at missions to convert First Nations/Native Americans to Catholicism and to share French culture. In 1673, Marquette joined the expedition of Louis Jolliet, a French-Canadian explorer, and departed from St. Ignace on May 17, with two canoes and five voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry (Métis) on a voyage to find the Mississippi River. They were successful and descended downriver as far as Arkansas.
While separately exploring the Great Lakes region on the ship &quot;Le Griffon&quot; with Louis Hennepin, Sieur de La Salle reached St. Ignace on August 27, 1679. Louis de La Porte, Sieur de Louvigny founded Fort de Buade here in 1681 as a fur trading post. It was later directed by Antoine Cadillac. It was closed by the French in 1697. The Jesuits abandoned their mission in 1705.

The Ojibwe, who came to dominate most of the Native American territory of present-day Michigan in the 18th century, were allies of the French in the Seven Years&#x27; War against the British. After the British victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, in 1763 they took over the territory of France in North America, including this part of the former New France. After the victory of rebellious colonists in the American Revolutionary War, in 1783 the village was included within the new United States, as part of what became called its Northwest Territory.

An important fur trading site for both the French and the British, St. Ignace declined in importance by the early 19th century. The Ojibwe had allied with Great Britain in the War of 1812, based on their long trading and a hope they would expel American colonists. The fur trade declined at St. Ignace largely because the United States prohibited British Canadian traders from operating across the border after the end of the war. At the same time European demand for North American furs was declining as tastes changed, and other parts of the economy grew.

Both British-Canadians and later Americans operated a larger trading center at Sault Ste. Marie, which developed on both sides of the Canadian-US border, until the decline of the fur trade in the 1830s. The fur trade also suffered before and during the hostilities of the War of 1812, as the United States first imposed a boycott on all trade with England, including traders in Canada. Many local people kept businesses going by smuggling, but postwar prohibitions on the fur trade were more difficult to avoid. prohibited British traders from operating across the border, as had been their earlier practice. The Ojibwe had allied with the British, their longtime trading partners, during the War of 1812,

In 1882, construction of the Detroit, Mackinac and Marquette Railroad, which connected the straits area to the major city of Detroit, provided an economic boost to the village. Farmers and the lumber industry could more easily get products to a major market. St. Ignace was incorporated as a village on February 23, 1882, and as a city in 1883.

In the late 19th century, a new sector of its economy developed, as it began to attract tourists as a popular summer resort and for its connection to Mackinac Island.

Since the late 20th century, the city has become a rural destination for heritage tourism and is part of a regional area popular for summer tourism. A variety of water sports and activities are available.

The Mackinac Bands of Chippewa and Ottawa Indians, a state-recognized tribe, is based in St. Ignace. It also has bands in several other counties in the region. With an enrolled membership of 4,000 in this area and state recognition, it has been seeking federal recognition since 1998. The larger federally recognized Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, based in the city of that name and the region of northern Michigan, owns and operates a gaming casino in St. Ignace on land it controls in the city, in addition to land and casinos in four other cities in the state.

<text>Armada ( ) is a village in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,684 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Armada Township. It is best known for its annual Armada Fair.

==History==

The first record of land purchased in the area that became Armada Township was made by John Proctor in 1825. Twenty-three more families had bought land in the rural area by 1832. Until that year the area was part of Ray Township. At that time a meeting was called to organize a separate township. The vote won by two and Armada Township was founded. When the discussion began to choose the name for the new township, legend says that &quot;Hosea Northrup jumped up and shouted the name &#x27;Armada&#x27;&quot;. The name was accepted.
Several communities were founded within the township, which was originally developed for agriculture. What became the village of Armada was founded in 1833 by Elijah Burke; it was originally called &quot;Burke&#x27;s Corners&quot; after him. The village began to prosper when residents improved the old Indian trail for use as a roadway in the early 1830s. The road soon became part of the immigrant and migrant road network between Romeo and Port Huron, Michigan. Today this is known as Armada Ridge Road.
Burke&#x27;s Corners was briefly renamed &quot;Honeoye&quot;, for the New York hometown of several newly arrived migrants. When the village was finally incorporated in the late 1860s, it was officially named &quot;Armada&quot;, the same as the township. By then the village had about 800 inhabitants.
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the village had a stagecoach stop, an opera house, a theater, seven grocery stores, three hotels, three hardware stores, a lumberyard, a grain mill, two implement dealers, a bakery, five doctors, several blacksmiths shops, and a drug store. 
The first school in Armada was a one-room schoolhouse located at Selleck&#x27;s Corners. Soon schools were built all around the township. These one-room schools were consolidated during the 1940s. At that time, children were bused into town to attend the schools of the consolidated district.
Armada&#x27;s interest in education was demonstrated in the early 20th century by their applying to the Carnegie Foundation for matching funds in order to build and operate a public library. Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s program was based on providing grants to villages and towns that would both provide matching funds for construction and commit to supporting all operations and maintenance of libraries. The residents committee of the township asked for $8,000 toward building a permanent township library. The Armada Free Public Library was built in 1915 and is still being used to provide library service in the early 21st century. 
A number of fraternal organizations, a literary club, a science club, and the Armada Cornet Band were among the social outlets for villagers and township residents. 
The Michigan Air Line Railway connected Armada to other cities in Michigan and elsewhere. Passengers and freight were processed through the two-door depot at the foot of Church Street. A cartage company delivered the freight to uptown businesses by horse and wagon.

In 2014, the village was shut down due to an investigation by Michigan State Police and the FBI of the murder of 14-year-old April Millsap, who was walking her dog on the Macomb Orchard Trail. Her body was found just outside the village limits. In 2016 a jury found the 34-year-old defendant, James VanCallis, a man from St. Clair County, to be guilty of four counts associated with the murder. He was sentenced to life in prison.

Following this, residents came together to support their community. In a July 2019 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; vote, Armada was selected as the &quot;Nicest Place in Michigan&quot;. It was a finalist for the magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Nicest Places in America&quot; story.

<doc id="118005" wikidata="Q2427389" url="?curid=118005" title="Center Line, Michigan">
<text>Center Line is a city in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Metro Detroit, Center Line is located roughly north of downtown Detroit, and is completely surrounded by the larger city of Warren. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 8,552.

==History==
Historically, the land that Center Line came to occupy was swamp and wilderness until the early nineteenth century. As land became scarce, French, German, Belgian, and Irish immigrants began clearing the forests and draining the swamps. Center Line was known as &quot;Kunrod&#x27;s Corner&quot; during the mid-nineteenth century. The theory is that the French named it &quot;Center Line&quot; because it was the middle of three Potawatomi trails from Fort Detroit to northern trading posts. The &quot;center line&quot; was the trail used from Detroit to Utica. The community received its initial start when Catholics decided to build a church so that they would not have to walk to St. Mary&#x27;s in Detroit for Sunday Mass. This church (St. Clement&#x27;s) was established in 1854 and attracted more Catholic settlers into the area. In 1863, the first general store was constructed by Joeseph Buechel. On July 19, 1878, Hieronymous Engelmann was the first postmaster, and he was succeeded in 1885 by Sophia Buechel. The &quot;Centre Line&quot; post office closed on July 31, 1906, and the name was restored to Center Line thereafter. In this era, street car tracks connected Detroit to Center Line along Van Dyke Road, and Ten Mile Road was the final stop of the street car. The village was incorporated in 1925 in the center of Warren Township, which is now the city of Warren, and was incorporated as a city in 1936.

==Geography==
Center Line is in southwestern Macomb County and is surrounded entirely by the city of Warren. It is north of downtown Detroit, west of St. Clair Shores, east of Royal Oak, and south of Utica.

<doc id="118006" wikidata="Q2223832" url="?curid=118006" title="Chesterfield Township, Michigan">
<text>Chesterfield Charter Township is a charter township of Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census the population was 45,376.

The township was organized in 1842, formed from a portion of Macomb Township. In 1989 it gained charter status. The township is part of Metro Detroit.

==History==
Chesterfield Township was originally established as a general law township in 1842. It became a charter township in 1989.

The original European-American settlement in the area was a hamlet called Chesterfield, first settled in 1830. When the Grand Trunk Railway came through in 1865, it stimulated the development of businesses in the hamlet. It had a post office from 1875 until 1907, but has since lost its specific identity.

==Geography==
Chesterfield Township is in eastern Macomb County and is bordered on the north by Lenox Township and the village of New Haven; on the east by Ira Township in St. Clair County, and by the village of New Baltimore; on the southeast by Anchor Bay, which is a part of Lake St. Clair; on the south by Harrison Township; and on the west by Macomb Township.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 9.85%, are water.

Much of Chesterfield Township is dominated by suburban subdivisions and shopping developments; its population is increasingly diverse, reflecting area demographic changes. In 2010 some 89% of the population identified as non-Hispanic whites; in the late 20th century, the largely rural township had an even higher percentage of whites. Anchor Bay influences the southeastern part of the community, where many pleasure boats, docks, and marine-related businesses can be found. 
==Communities==
There are nine unincorporated communities in the township and no incorporated villages:
* Anchor Bay Gardens is located off Jefferson Avenue at Sunrise Street and Jans Drive (; Elevation: 571 ft./174 m.).
* Anchor Bay Harbor is located on Jefferson Avenue south of Anchor Bay Gardens, between Sugerbush and Cotton roads (; Elevation: 577 ft./176 m.).
* Anchor Bay Shores is located off Jefferson Avenue, south of Anchor Bay Harbor between William P. Rosso Highway and 21 Mile Road (; Elevation: 581 ft./177 m.) 
* Chesterfield is located on M-3 from 23 Mile Road to 22 Mile Road. (; Elevation: 607 ft./185 m.)
* Chesterfield Shores is near the border with City of New Baltimore north of Jefferson Avenue and south of M-29/23 Mile Road ( ; Elevation: 587 ft./179 m.).
* Fairchild was located in the southern portion of the township. It had a post office starting in 1906.
* Lottivue is located between Jefferson Avenue, Lake Saint Clair, Brandenburg Park and Schneider Road ( ; Elevation: 577 ft./176 m.).
* Milton is located at Gratiot Avenue and 24 Mile Road (; Elevation: 607 ft./185 m.) and once was a station on the Grand Trunk Railroad. The first post office in the township was established here in 1837 in the house of Robert O. Milton, with the name of &quot;New Haven Post Office&quot;. When this was moved to New Haven, Alfred D. Rice established another post office in Milton. That post office closed at some point, and another was opened in January 1856, with Edmund Matthews as postmaster. This office operated until July 1904. Milton was home to a school, three churches, a doctor, a blacksmith, and a couple of saloons. The last saloon survived until 2004, when it was torn down, at that time it was known as the &quot;Teddy Bear Bar.&quot; The school, known as Milton School, was incorporated into another building, which was torn down in 2002.
* Point Lakeview is located southwest of Lottivue between the Salt River and Lake Saint Clair.
* Sebille Manor is located northwest of Anchor Bay Harbor between Sugarbush and Donner roads (; Elevation: 587 ft./179 m.).

<text>Clinton Township is a charter township in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit, Clinton Township is located about northeast of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the township had a population of 100,513, making it the most populous township in Michigan, and the state&#x27;s 8th-most populous community overall.

==History==
The first settlement on the land that is now Clinton Township was called Gnadenhuetten and was established in 1782 by Rev. David Zeisberger, but closed in 1786. It was organized as &quot;Huron Township&quot; on August 12, 1818, named after what was then known as the Huron River. Because of confusion with another Huron River south of Detroit, on July 17, 1824, the Michigan Territorial Legislature renamed both the township and the river after DeWitt Clinton, the popular governor of New York from 1817 to 1823 who was largely responsible for building the Erie Canal which enabled many settlers to come to Michigan.

Moravian Drive is the township&#x27;s oldest road, dating back to the days when Moravian missionaries settled to attempt to convert the local Native Americans.

<text>Eastpointe (formerly East Detroit) is a city in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Eastpointe borders Detroit to the south, roughly northeast of Downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 34,318.

==History==

The community was first settled by Irish and German immigrants in the 1830s. In October 1897, a post office was established there with the name of &quot;Half-way&quot;, as it was near the halfway point of the stage run between downtown Detroit and the Macomb County seat at Mount Clemens. It incorporated as the village of Halfway in December 1924 and reincorporated as the city of East Detroit in January 1929. Prior to 1924, most of the community formed a part of Erin Township (which includes all or part of Eastpointe, Roseville, and St. Clair Shores. The city changed its name to &quot;Eastpointe&quot; after the change was approved by residents in a 1992 referendum; the name change had been proposed to remove any perceived association with the adjacent city of Detroit; the &quot;pointe&quot; suffix is intended to associate the city instead with the nearby affluent communities of the Grosse Pointes. The city also changed its name to give the community a sense that it was its own city with its own unique history, identity, and not an extension or branch of Detroit. Other names were also nominated for the referendum never balloted.

The city&#x27;s school district was unaffected by the municipal name change, and was called East Detroit Public Schools until 2017, when it changed the district name to Eastpointe Community Schools to align with the community name. It has one high school (Eastpointe High School), one middle school (Eastpointe Middle School, formerly Kelly Middle School), and four elementary schools. The primary district boundaries of Eastpointe Community Schools encompass the City of Eastpointe, minus the northeastern portion (east of Kelly Rd. and north of Stephens) and the southeastern portion of the city of Warren.

==Geography==

Eastpointe has many summer festivals and events, including Erin-Halfway Days Living History Festival held at John F. Kennedy Memorial Park in late July, Music in the Park Wednesday nights at Spindler Park, and Summer Fest, formerly known as The Ox Roast, mid to late August at John F. Kennedy Memorial Park.

==Government==
Eastpointe is a Michigan home-rule city and operates under the council-manager form of government. The city&#x27;s mayor and four council members are elected at large to four-year staggered terms.

In 2017, Eastpointe elected its first African-American councilwoman, Monique Owens. In 2019, Suzanne Pixley, who had been mayor since 2007, did not seek reelection after her third four-year term. Councilwoman Monique Owens succeeded Pixley as mayor in 2019, becoming the first African-American mayor of Eastpointe.

Owens was unseated in the 2023 mayoral primary. Her tenure as mayor was marred by multiple scandals, including a lawsuit alleging that she violated residents&#x27; First Amendment rights and a criminal charge for alleged false statements on a grant application. Residents also objected to police reports she made against critics, her failure to file financial disclosure statements, her heated tirades against residents and other officials during meetings, and her lack of support for the LGBT community.

On November 7, 2023, voters chose former city council member Michael Klinefelt as mayor. Eastpointe voters also elected incumbent Harvey Curley and newcomer Margaret Podsiadlik to the city council. The three were sworn in the following Monday.

===Discrimination lawsuit===
After a racial discrimination lawsuit was brought against the city regarding its election of all city council members through Plurality-at-large voting, alleging that the plurality-at-large system discriminated against African-American voters and violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the city settled the lawsuit with the United States Department of Justice in June 2019 by agreeing to switch to single transferable vote for the at-large election of city council members for the November 2019 municipal election.

Beginning with the November 2019 election, ranked choice voting was used on the city council ballot, making Eastpointe the first municipality in Michigan to adopt ranked choice voting.

===First Amendment lawsuit===
In 2022, four Eastpointe residents filed a federal lawsuit against the City of Eastpointe and Mayor Monique Owens alleging violations of their First Amendment rights. The plaintiffs alleged that Owens had interrupted and censored their remarks during time allotted for public comments at council meetings and engaged in viewpoint discrimination against them. The complaint requested that the city amend its public comment rules and sought damages from the mayor.

On December 8, 2022, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Owens from shouting down speakers or restricting the subject matter of their remarks. The order is to remain in effect until the case is resolved or the court orders otherwise.

The lawsuit stemmed largely from an incident at the council&#x27;s September 6, 2022, meeting, during which Owens interrupted or talked over three residents who had attempted to speak. As Owens argued with one of the residents, the other four council members walked out, ending the meeting.

<text>Mount Clemens is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 15,697 at the 2020 census. It is the seat of government of Macomb County and part of the Detroit metropolitan area.

==History==
Mount Clemens was first surveyed in 1795 after the Revolutionary War by Christian Clemens, who settled there four years later. Clemens and his friend, John Brooks, built a distillery, which attracted workers and customers, helping to settle the area. Brooks and Clemens platted the land, and the town was named after Clemens in 1818. It received a post office in 1821, with John Stockton as the first postmaster. Christian Clemens is buried at Clemens Park, located just north of downtown.

Indian mounds were in the vicinity, more specifically just north of the Clinton River near the present location of Selfridge Air National Guard Base.

The settlement filed for incorporation as a village in 1837, but this was not acted upon by the legislature until 1851. It was incorporated as a city in 1879. It became the seat of Macomb County on March 11, 1818.

The Mount Clemens Public Library opened in 1865.

Historically, Mount Clemens&#x27; largest industry for more than 100 years, from 1873 to 1974, was tourism related to the mineral baths, drawn from springs that were scattered throughout the city. Such mineral baths were very popular and were tourist destinations. At the peak of the industry, the city had 11 bathhouses and several hotels related to this trade. The first bathhouse was built in 1873 and was known as &quot;The Original&quot;; it was located on the corner of Jones and Water streets. The bathhouse burned in 1883, but it was rebuilt even larger the following year to accommodate the crowds of customers. Over the years, noted visitors such as film actors Clark Gable and Mae West, athletes Babe Ruth and Jack Dempsey, news magnate William Randolph Hearst, and the wealthy Vanderbilt family vacationed in the city to take advantage of the mineral springs baths.

The only remaining bathhouse building from this era is St. Joseph&#x27;s Sanitarium and Bath House. It has recently been renamed as Select Specialty Hospital and is owned by Select Medical Corporation. This last bath house is in danger of being demolished, but the Friends of Historic Preservation are working with the city to preserve it.

The Olympia Salon &amp; Spa, located in the Martha Washington Sanitarium on Cass Avenue, is again offering mineral baths.

From about 1898 to 1950, the Mount Clemens Sugar Company operated, processing sugar beets into refined sugar.

Throughout the late 20th century, the suburban expansion of metropolitan Detroit and its exurbs affected the city of Mt. Clemens as well as its surrounding townships.

Approximately 42% of properties in the city are tax-exempt, resulting in lost revenue of $1.2 million. In an attempt to raise funds to combat a $960,000 budget deficit for 2010, former Mayor Barb Dempsey solicited donations to the city&#x27;s general fund from tax-exempt organizations like churches, schools and a hospital, in order to pay for services like fire protection, streetlights and roads. The city already disbanded the 113-year-old police department in 2005 to cut costs. The Macomb County Sheriff’s Office now provides primary policing services in Mount Clemens. The deficit is projected to reach $1.5 million in 2011.

<text>New Baltimore is a city in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 12,117 at the 2020 census. New Baltimore is a northern suburb of Metro Detroit and is located along the northern shores of Lake St. Clair.

== History ==
New Baltimore incorporated as a village in 1867 and as a city in 1931. Previously, it was split between Macomb and St. Clair counties; however, in the 1970s, the city was able to petition to adjust the county boundaries such that it would align with the city&#x27;s eastern border. This placed New Baltimore completely in Macomb County, where it remains to this day. The town sits on the waterfront along Lake St. Clair&#x27;s Anchor Bay, and offers a public park, beach, and downtown-shopping district.

Prior to the arrival of European settlers, indigenous tribes are known to have inhabited much of New Baltimore&#x27;s shoreline for thousands of years, and in the 1800s the land was recorded to have many ancient burial mounds and man made earth-works. W.B Hinsdale excavated multiple sites in New Baltimore, and recorded his countless findings in his novels in the early 20th century. Most of these locations have long been destroyed by treasure hunters and developed over, with an unfortunate though seemingly familiar lack of regard to the public&#x27;s knowledge of the city&#x27;s vast history with indigenous tribes.

German explorer Pierre Yax (b.1763) in Grosse Pointe, New France (now Michigan) was the first recorded non-Native American in the New Baltimore area. Pierre Yax was a son of Johan Michael Jacks, the first German in what would eventually become the state of Michigan. Pierre Yax arrived in New Baltimore in 1796 and subsequently obtained a land grant signed by President John Quincy Adams on July 23, 1826. The land grant tracked back to a land patent Yax had in 1812, when Michigan was still part of the Michigan Territory.

Later, other French settlers came to this area and took residence along the waterfront and rivers. They developed farms that had narrow frontage of 400 of 900 feet and extended inland from the water. Generally, the depth of the parcel was determined by how far a man could plow or cultivate in a day.

The first evidence of a settled community came in 1845, when a Mount Clemens businessman, Alfred Ashley, platted of land lying on both sides of Washington Street. This would become known as the village of Ashley. On September 20, 1851, a post office called Ashleyville was established with Ashley as postmaster. Ashley also opened businesses in lumbering, shipping, and real estate. The original village of Ashley occupied what is now the center part of downtown New Baltimore, extending northwest along Clay, Base and Maria Streets from Anchor Bay. The land was subdivided in the typical gridiron fashion used in most American communities at that time. Over the years, irregularities developed in the gridiron subdivision pattern because of the lack of local controls, conflicts with French claims, and changing land uses, particularly along the waterfront area. This created problems in both subdivision patterns in general and waterfront use in particular that remain today. This original settlement bore Ashley&#x27;s name until 1867, when the village name was changed to New Baltimore.

Throughout its history, New Baltimore has been linked to the regional economy by virtue of the city&#x27;s access to the waterfront and the region&#x27;s transportation network. In its early years, New Baltimore took advantage of its waterfront location to operate port facilities exporting agriculture and manufacturing products to other communities. The area was known for the manufacturing of barrels, brooms, bricks, coffins, corsets, and creamery products. Lumber products and building materials were shipped by boat from the local mills. Development was heavily oriented to the waterfront, where shipping piers extended a hundred or more feet into the lake.

As automobile transportation increased in importance and travel patterns changed, so did the development of the city. Goods were no longer shipped by water and the waterfront slowly changed. Between 1860 and 1880, New Baltimore changed from a strong manufacturing and exporting community to a thriving community in Macomb County with many resort activities and well-known commercial establishments. The community was a popular getaway spot for Metro Detroiters and boasted an opera house, hotels, salt baths (which nearby city of Mount Clemens was famous for in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), summer and winter recreational activities, saloons, a brewery and numerous resort and commercial establishments. The city was in the path of a steam locomotive line that ran between Detroit and Port Huron in the late 19th century. As technology changed, the city constructed an electricity plant to accommodate inter-urban passenger trains, which lasted until the mid-1920s. Today, access to the city is provided via Interstate 94. The historic New Baltimore water tower was demolished in the summer of 2015 and raised in the park to take its place was the State&#x27;s tallest flag. The flagpole stands at 160 feet tall on the shores of Anchor Bay at Walter and Mary Burke Park. The New Baltimore Lions Club raised more than $100,000 to have the flagpole installed with the intention of creating a landmark for boaters after the city&#x27;s historic water tower was demolished. A dedication ceremony took place in October 2016.

<text>New Haven is a village in Lenox Township within Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 6,097 at the 2020 census, up from 4,642 in 2010.

==History==
===Origins and early history===

The first settlers in the New Haven area were chiefly the Native Americans of the Ojibwa/Cherokee tribe. The Swan Creek Chippewa is a predominant segment of the tribe. French settlers came to the area in 1835 when the first land was purchased from the federal government.

The settlement was originally called &quot;New Baltimore Station&quot; because of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad depot located there that did its main commerce with the village of New Baltimore, on Anchor Bay of Lake St. Clair and at the other end of the New Haven/Romeo plank road (also known as the Ashley/Romeo Plank Road) that served the area. The portion of the plank road that went through the village became the main road of New Haven. This road changes its name a few times, becoming Main Street in New Haven and Washington Street in New Baltimore.

The Grand Trunk Western railroad company that built the railroad station in 1865 handled freight, livestock, and later farm goods shipped by rail throughout the Midwest. The depot had a living quarters for the station agent and his family at one end. With rounded windows in the Italianate style, it was similar to the Smiths Creek depot that is now in Greenfield Village. The depot is still located in its original location, one of the few in the Midwest that can claim that distinction. It has been restored as the village museum.

New Haven received its first post office on January 6, 1838, and Charles B. Matthews was the postmaster. Adam Bennett was the most active organizer of the village in its earliest days.

Benjamin L. Bates was elected as the first village president when the village of New Haven was incorporated on May 3, 1869. New Haven is the largest incorporated area in Lenox Township of Macomb County.

By around 1875, early industries in the village of New Haven included a general store, a sawmill, an iron foundry, a creamery, hardware store, a roller place that made flour, a farm supply business, two doctors, three flour, seed, and feed businesses, two garages to repair carriages and machinery of the day, a grocery and meat shop, a dry goods store, a drug store, a cooper (barrel) shop, two blacksmiths, two shoe and boot stores, a harness shop, a stove shop, two wagon shops, a livery stable, and a hotel chiefly known as the Graustark Hotel.

By the early 1900s, New Haven had electricity produced in a power house located on the north side of Ann Street, owned by Frank Phelps, also the owner of one of the first motorcars in the village. He had the dynamo that produced enough electricity to light the whole village located in the back of his building, originally called the Old Power House. In the front of the building he sold ice cream, candy and other items such as oyster stew. He would also project movies on weekend nights. He would use a large screen secured between two poles to project silent films (with phonograph accompaniment) to the townspeople.

New Haven built their own water system in 1945. In 1948, the New Haven Public Library was formed.

New Haven had a few newspapers in its history. It appears that the village had two newspapers during 1895. The Saturday, January 12, 1895, issue (Vol. I, No. 19) of &quot;The Advance&quot; was published by T.A. Barnard. Single issues cost three cents; a yearly subscription could be had for a dollar. The Friday, November 22, 1895, issue of &quot;The Weekly Star&quot; (Vol. I, No. 27), was published by Herman Burose &amp; Co., and in 1912 there was &quot;The People&#x27;s Advocate&quot;. From 1919 to 1924 there was &quot;The New Haven Star&quot;. In the 1940s, there was the &quot;New Haven Herald&quot;, eventually purchased by the &quot;Anchor Bay Beacon&quot; of New Baltimore. In 2017, New Haven High School won a Michigan championship basketball game.

<text>Romeo is a village in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,767 at the 2020 census. Romeo is located on the rural-urban fringe of the Detroit metropolitan area, and many of its residents commute to jobs closer to the city.

==History==
A settlement here was originally occupied by the indigenous Chippewa (Ojibwe), an Algonquian-speaking people who were part of a large language family of tribes extending to the Atlantic Coast. Those tribes around the Great Lakes are thought to have migrated to this area by the 12th century.

The early European-American settlers in this area referred to the Chippewa settlement as &quot;Indian Village&quot;. In the 1820s and 1830s more migrant European-American families began to settle in the area, building homes and establishing businesses. They renamed the community &quot;Hoxie&#x27;s Settlement&quot;, after a man who opened an inn on Main Street. In 1839, Hoxie&#x27;s Settlement became incorporated and was renamed as the village of Romeo. The name was suggested by the wife of local merchant Nathaniel Taylor because it was &quot;short, musical, classical and uncommon.&quot; Romeo celebrated its 175th anniversary on March 9, 2013.
Romeo once served as a trading center for the timber industry, and had many mills processing lumber from the region. Many wealthy timber families resided there. Dozens of stately Victorian mansions survive. Romeo is distinct in the area for having a fairly robust, traditional downtown, which has never suffered a major fire. Because of this, some stores and restaurants downtown have features such as original tin ceilings from the Civil War. In the early 20th century, Romeo was the site of an early business devoted to the new automobile industry: the Detroit Auto Vehicle Company operated here from 1904 until 1908.

==Geography==
The village is in northwestern Macomb County, situated at the southeast corner of Bruce Township, with a portion extending south into Washington Township. Armada Township is adjacent to the east and Ray Township to the southeast. M-53 passes through the east side of the village, leading north to Imlay City and south to the eastern side of Detroit.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village of Romeo has a total area of , of which , or 0.10%, are water. East Pond Creek crosses the easternmost part of the village, flowing east to the North Branch of the Clinton River, part of the Lake St. Clair watershed.

==Government==
The government of the village of Romeo consists of elected and appointed officials. The elected officials include six council members, one president, treasurer and clerk. The appointed officials include the Chief of Police, Department of Public Works Director, and Village Administrator. Currently, the elected clerk also holds the appointed position of Village Administrator. The day-to-day operations of the village are handled by the Clerk/Administrator.

Since the turn of the 21st century, Romeo has worked to upgrade its infrastructure. It has improved the streetscape on Van Dyke Avenue, the main road through the village, and installed a new water tower. It had earlier established one of the few wastewater treatment plants in the region. While most of the metropolitan region receives water and sewage service from the City of Detroit, Romeo independently sustains its own supply of water and manages treatment of village sewage. This was especially valuable during the blackout that occurred throughout the entire northeastern United States on August 14, 2003. Romeo was one of the few areas in the Detroit metropolitan area to have clean running water. More recent infrastructure improvements include a complete renovation of the village water system, and replacement of all the sidewalks throughout the village.

==Schools==
Romeo has one high school (including a ninth grade academy), one middle school and five elementary schools. Most of the schools are located outside the village limits.

<text>Roseville is a city in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit, Roseville is located roughly northeast of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 47,710.

== History ==
The first permanent post office in the area was established in 1840 by William Rose who named it &quot;Roseville&quot; in honor of his father Dennison Rose, a veteran of the War of 1812.

The village of Roseville was incorporated in 1926, and the municipal building was constructed in 1929 at Gratiot Avenue and Meier Road. This replaced the Erin Township Building that was built near the corner of 11 Mile Road and Gratiot in 1886. The 1929 building housed administrative offices as well as the police and fire departments until the 1960s, when separate police and fire stations were constructed. City offices remained in the building until 1974.

Michigan&#x27;s first commercial airport, Packard Field, opened at Gratiot Avenue and Frazho Road in 1919. It was renamed Gratiot Airport in 1929, and later Hartung Field. The Eastgate Shopping Center was constructed on the site in the 1950s.

The Erin-Roseville Library was established in 1936 in one room of the municipal building. The library moved to its own building in the 1960s and into the newly constructed civic center in 1974. In 2010, it was circulating approximately 250,000 items annually.

In 1958, the village and remaining parts of Erin Township were incorporated as the City of Roseville.

An early regional mall, the Macomb Mall, opened in 1964 and is still open today, located west of Gratiot and Masonic.

Utica, located on the southern edge of the township, originally incorporated as a village on March 9, 1838, although that corporation was dissolved soon afterwards. The village was incorporated for a second time on May 10, 1877.

The village of Disco () was located at what is now the junction of 24 Mile Road and Van Dyke Road. and was platted in 1849. The community never incorporated, although the local high school, the Disco Academy, gained some local recognition and a post office named Disco operated from May 5, 1854, until July 31, 1906.

<text>St. Clair Shores is a city in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, St. Clair Shores is located roughly northeast of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 58,874.

==History==
Located along the shores of Lake St. Clair and inhabited by French settlers as early as 1710, during which time the area was referred to as &quot;L&#x27;anse Creuse&quot;, the future St. Clair Shores would remain mainly a rural farming area populated by largely French and German immigrant families into the early 20th century. These local family surnames have survived into the 21st century and can be found in the surnames of current residents and among numerous residential street names.

From 1835 until 1843, the area was part of Orange Township, among the first townships platted in Michigan and part of Macomb County. In 1843, Orange Township was renamed Erin Township, in homage to the numerous Irish immigrants who had moved into the area and had begun to exert their political influence. From 1843 until 1911, what is now St. Clair Shores was a part of Erin Township, parts of which make up today&#x27;s municipalities of Eastpointe, Roseville, and St. Clair Shores.

In 1911, the eastern portion of Erin Township was partitioned off to become Lake Township. St. Clair Shores was incorporated as a village in 1925 and remained a part of Lake Township until, after numerous failed attempts, its residents voted to incorporate as the city of St. Clair Shores in January 1951. Lake Township continued adjacent to the city until 2009, when residents of the village of Grosse Pointe Shores (that portion of Grosse Pointe Shores in Macomb County located within Lake Township) voted to incorporate as a city. 

Beginning around the time of the First World War, St. Clair Shores became a favored playground for gamblers, rum runners, and lakefront tourists alike, culminating during Prohibition, but continuing through the Second World War era. During these years, the village was the home to many popular s, blind pigs, and gambling establishments, such as the Blossom Heath Inn. St. Clair Shores&#x27; lakefront location and proximity to Canada coupled with a receptive and often participative community made it an advantageous haven for rum runners, and the area was actively involved in the rum-running era of Prohibition. Local residents, politicians, and law enforcement of the era were known to sometimes conflict with both state and federal officials over their attempts to regulate these illegal, but economically vital, activities within the community.

The Eagle Pointe subdivision, one of many platted within the village of St. Clair Shores during the early 20th century, was platted along a part of the lake shore in 1916. During the next few decades, dozens of subdivisions were platted through the local farmland, but most were not developed in earnest until after the Second World War, when St. Clair Shores became the fastest-growing suburb of Detroit during the 1950s.

From 1927 until 1959, the community was the location of the Jefferson Beach Amusement Park, a major lakefront attraction for the Detroit area and beyond. Opened in 1927, it boasted the longest roller coaster in the United States and numerous other midway attractions, a large, ornate lakefront dance pavilion, and a large, sandy beach popular with swimmers and sun bathers. In 1955, a fire destroyed some of the attractions and buildings within the once-popular park, and this, coupled with changing public tastes, accelerated its demise. While the owners of Jefferson Beach Amusement Park considered rebuilding, by this time the park was not popular with local government officials, and the city council had begun exploring forcing the closure of the facility or purchasing it for public use. Instead, the park owners, who had previously started building an onsite marina facility, began to expand that part of the facility. By 1959, the remaining park amusements and buildings were demolished to make room for the greatly enlarged Jefferson Beach Marina. All that remained of the once grand amusement park was its large, ornate lakefront dance coliseum, which for years thereafter was relegated to use as a marina storage facility and marine supply store until it, too, was destroyed by fire.

==Geography==
St. Clair Shores is in southern Macomb County, on the western side of Lake St. Clair. It is bordered to the west by the cities of Roseville and Eastpointe and to the south, in Wayne County, by Harper Woods, Grosse Pointe Woods, and Grosse Pointe Shores. Interstate 94 runs along the western edge of the city, with access from Exits 224 through 230. I-94 leads southwest to midtown Detroit and northeast to Port Huron.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, St. Clair Shores has a total area of , of which , or 18.9%, are covered by water. The city has of canals. Most of these canals are found in the Nautical Mile, which is along Jefferson between 9 Mile and 10 Mile Roads.

==Attractions==
The Nautical Mile, a mile-long, lakefront strip of Jefferson Avenue between 9 Mile Road and 10 Mile Road, features a nautical-themed streetscape, retail establishments, restaurants, boat dealers, and both private and civic marinas. This business district is dominated by the tallest structure in St. Clair Shores, the 28-story Shore Club Sky Tower, colloquially known as &quot;9 Mile Tower&quot;, and located at the foot of Nine Mile Road and Jefferson Avenue on the lakefront. The residential tower has become a prominent nautical landmark, and its rooftop beacon can be seen for many miles.

St. Clair Shores is home to the longest-consecutively running preliminary program pageant of the Miss America Organization in Michigan and among the longest-running in the United States. Since 1953, the Miss St. Clair Shores Scholarship Program has offered scholarships to young women in the community ages 17–24. The pageant is held each July at the local South Lake High School Auditorium. Miss St. Clair Shores volunteers and serves her city during her preparation to compete at the Miss Michigan Pageant.

Dating back to its years as a popular lakefront entertainment destination, St. Clair Shores has a long connection to Detroit&#x27;s musical history. In addition to the many past roadhouses that featured numerous national performing artists of the era, other notable music-related locations include the former Car City Records store, whose employees have included many from the Detroit music scene; the former Crows Nest East, a short-lived, but popular music venue of the late 1960s; and the former Shirley&#x27;s Swinger Lounge. Individuals and groups who played at or frequented these venues went on to regional and national success, including Bob Seger, the MC5, Iggy Pop, and The Frost.

St. Clair Shores, one of a few communities to lay claim to the &quot;Hockeytown USA&quot; moniker before the Detroit Red Wings and the city of Detroit, is renowned throughout both the US and Canada as a long-time youth hockey hotbed, largely related to its long-successful St. Clair Shores Hockey Association. Once the home to the United States&#x27; first privately owned indoor ice hockey arena, Gordie Howe Hockeyland, St. Clair Shores also boasts two municipal indoor ice arenas at its civic recreation center. Owing to its tremendously popular aforementioned youth hockey association, local high school hockey often dominated the local competition of the 1970s, with all three local high schools participating. St. Clair Shores Lakeview High School went undefeated during its famed 1973 state high-school championship season. Although the once beloved Gordie Howe Hockeyland has since closed, youth hockey is still very popular in St. Clair Shores and vintage references to &quot;Hockeytown USA&quot; can still be found inside the St. Clair Shores Civic Arena.

Although its population has dropped from its peak in the early 1970s due to end of the baby boomer era and continued urban sprawl, St. Clair Shores continues to be a popular suburb of Detroit, owing largely to its advantageous lakefront location, its municipal park system, its fine recreational sports programs and facilities, and its three public school districts.

<text>Sterling Heights is a city in Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit, Sterling Heights is located roughly north of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 134,346, placing Sterling Heights as the second-largest suburb of Detroit, and the fourth-most populous city in Michigan.

==History==
As a result of the War of 1812 and the 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs, the area of the Michigan Territory which now makes up Sterling Heights was first surveyed by Deputy Surveyor Joseph Wampler; his survey was approved on February 20, 1818. Wampler had been one of two deputy surveyors of Perrysburg, Ohio, in 1816.

Originally created as part of Shelby Township in April 1827, it was broken off as Jefferson Township in March 1835. In March 1838, it was renamed Sterling Township.

Until the 1950s, Sterling Township was an agricultural area, largely devoted to growing rhubarb and other crops sold in Detroit. Road improvements led to decreased commute times and lower costs for the delivery of goods and services to and from businesses. The population increased when suburban homes were built for the workers in metropolitan Detroit&#x27;s booming automobile industry. When Sterling Township was incorporated as a city in 1968, &quot;Heights&quot; was added to the name to satisfy a state law that prevents incorporated municipalities from having the same name, as there was already a small village named Sterling in Arenac County.

Gerald Donovan became the first mayor of the city and F. James Dunlop became the first mayor pro-tempore. In the 1960s and 1970s, many residents came to live in Sterling Heights to work in automobile plants operated by Chrysler and Ford. Lakeside Mall opened in Sterling Heights in 1976.

The city is home to many groups of immigrants. It has received many people of eastern European origins, including ethnic Albanians, Bosnians, Croatians, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Poles, Serbians and Slovenians. After the 2003 U.S.-Iraqi War, millions of Iraqi citizens were displaced, particularly Assyrians, whom the majority of which adhere to the Chaldean Catholic Church. Of these, 30,000-50,000 resettled in Sterling Heights, giving parts of the city the nickname &quot;Little Nineveh&quot;, especially around 15 Mile Road and Ryan.

==Geography==
Sterling Heights is a second-ring suburb, north of downtown Detroit. The city&#x27;s southern border is from Detroit&#x27;s northern border. The shape of the city is six miles long and miles wide. It is bordered to the south by the city of Warren, at its southwest corner by Madison Heights, to the west by Troy, to the north by Utica and Shelby Township, at its northeast corner by Macomb Township, to the east by Clinton Township, and to the southeast by Fraser.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Sterling Heights has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.74%, are water. The Clinton River crosses the northeast part of the city, flowing east to Lake St. Clair east of Mount Clemens.

=== Climate ===
Sterling Heights features a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;). Summers are somewhat hot with temperatures exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on average 8.6 days. Winters are cold, with temperatures not rising above freezing on 39.1 days annually, while dropping to or below 0 °F (−18 °C) on average 1.2 days a year.

===Neighboring cities/towns===
===Main highways===
Sterling Heights sits on two main thoroughfares:

====State highways====
* commonly called Van Dyke Avenue or the Van Dyke Freeway (they split in the city, however, and rejoin to its north), which leads north into The Thumb of Michigan.
*, commonly called Hall Road once the freeway ends—which is the east–west connector from just north of Mount Clemens, through Utica as a surface road, and then becomes a limited access freeway to Pontiac, being the main northern connector between Macomb County and Oakland County. In Sterling Heights, large areas are devoted to retail and commercial development (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Lakeside Mall).

====Other main roads====
*Mound Road is an important north–south artery that runs continuously through the city. Overall, the road starts south in Hamtramck and runs up to 32 Mile Road in Romeo. The road ends briefly at River Bends Park in Shelby Township (becoming Auburn Road), and continues just north of 22 Mile Road.
*East-west travel is mainly on the &quot;mile roads,&quot; beginning at 14 Mile Road through 20 Mile Road (M-59). 16 Mile Road, also known as Metro Parkway, is another major &quot;mile road&quot;. See Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit.
*Utica Road is an important diagonal connector that crisscrosses the city from southeast to northwest, going through the intersection of Dodge Park Road (across from the Sterling Heights city hall) via the first roundabout in Macomb County.
*Dequindre Road is the border between the city of Sterling Heights and the city of Troy. It is also the border between the counties of Macomb and Oakland.
*Hayes Road is the divider between Clinton Township (Between Utica Road and South of M59) and Fraser (Between Masonic and Moravian).

Others referred to the community as &quot;Hog&#x27;s Hollow&quot; or &quot;McDougalville&quot;, until a few years later it was named &quot;Utica&quot; by settlers from New York, in honor of the city of the same name in that state. This was common of settlers in this region, and is reflected in the names of nearby cities such as Rochester, Troy, and Livonia that are also named for New York cities.

By the 1940s, Utica was the center of a region of dairy farms and truck gardens. It had a flour mill and shipped rhubarb. Dodge Park a few miles south on the Clinton River was a state park.

As the 1950s progressed, Detroit auto companies began to build factories in neighboring Sterling and Shelby Townships, and the surrounding area began a transformation to an industrial economy.

Utica boasts a small historic district centered on Cass Avenue and Auburn Road, but few of the buildings predate 1906, due to destructive fires in 1905 and 1906.

==Geography==
Utica is in western Macomb County, bordered to the south by the city of Sterling Heights and to the north by Shelby Charter Township. Highways M-53 and M-59 serve the city. M-53 crosses the east side of the city, leading north to Romeo and south to Warren, while M-59 runs along the southern border of the city, leading east to Interstate 94 and west to Pontiac. Downtown Detroit is to the south.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Utica has a total area of , of which are water. The Clinton River passes through the center of the city, flowing southeast and then east to Lake St. Clair.

<text>Bear Lake is a village in Manistee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 342 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Bear Lake Township.

==History==
In 1836, individuals from various tribes of native people signed the Treaty of Washington, which ceded the northwest portion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan to the United States. At the time, native people lived in the Bear Lake area, evidence remaining in various burial mounds of the region, including one at Pierport.

The next year, in 1837, Michigan became a state.

In 1841, John Stronach and party came to the Manistee area and started a lumber mill. During the following twenty years, the city of Manistee grew as virgin forests were cut, and the logs put into the Manistee rivers to float to the mills on Manistee Lake.

=== Homesteading ===
On May 20, 1862, President Lincoln signed into law the Homestead Act, which offered of undeveloped federal land to anyone who filed an application, create a farm, and apply for a deed. Almost immediately, people began exploring the area between Manistee and Traverse City, looking for prime farmland.

In 1863, Russell Smith, D.E. Sibley, Elisha Richmond, George W. Hopkins, Simeon Anderson, and others came to Bear Lake on such scouting expeditions. At the time, the region was entirely heavily forested with white pine and hardwoods, and with only a single walking trail. Smith and Sibley both moved their families to the area that year, and began their homesteads. Sibley&#x27;s homestead was on the north side of Bear Lake; Smith&#x27;s was on the south side, and included the present village.

By 1864, Simeon Anderson and about 25 other families had started homesteads in the Bear Lake area. In that year Elisha Richmond made his first failed attempt to move his large family to the area from Illinois.

In 1865, the township of Bear Lake, also including the area of Pleasanton, was created, formerly being part of Brown Township. A township council was formed.

By 1867, many more families had established homesteads, and two-thirds of the prime farming land had been claimed. A post office was established, and the Elisha Richmond family completed the eleven-week journey to Bear Lake. In this year, George W. Hopkins, wife Ella Hopkins, brother David H. Hopkins, and sister Martha (Mattie) Hopkins arrived in Manistee to begin a brick manufacturing plant.

About this time, Russell Smith made an offer of some of his land to anyone who would set up a saw mill to turn the trees into lumber and a gristmill to create flour from grain. The offer was taken by Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Harrington, and rudimentary mills for each were constructed. Carpenter and Harrington then subdivided the land and offered it for sale. Stores were established by Anderson, Tillson, Erb, Lewis and A.H. Cook.

By 1870, the Hopkins family had switched from brick manufacturing to lumber, primarily putting logs in the Manistee rivers, and floating them to the mills for sale.

Homesteaders in Bear Lake were cutting the trees, and burning all the trees that they couldn&#x27;t use, in order to clear the land. There was no one interested in buying the trees, and no way to get cut logs or lumber to market. Prior to the sawmill, boards were brought by boat from Manistee to Portage Lake and then carried, or carted, to Bear Lake.

In 1873, the Hopkins family company purchased of the Smith property. The Bear Lake Tram Railway was built from the south side of Bear Lake down to Lake Michigan at Pierport. The railway was made of maple wood rails with steel strapping, and horse-drawn trailers were built and put on the rails. This railway enabled the transport of lumber cut in the Bear Lake sawmill to be moved to Lake Michigan, and then sold to the various markets in Chicago and Milwaukee.

In 1874, the Hopkins built a large sawmill, a brickyard, a gristmill, and a store.

=== Lumber boom years ===
On September 25, 1874, the original subdivision or plat map of the village was filed by the Hopkins family members including George W. Hopkins, Ella Hopkins, David H. Hopkins, Maurice M. Hopkins, and Mattie E. &quot;Martha&quot; Hopkins. This plat was amended in 1877, including a slight change to the position of Stuart Street.

The village was platted with 299 lots, and included almost all of the land bordered by the lake on the north, Smith Street on the east, Potter Road on the south, and West Street (which originally ran due north from the current Potter Road – US-31 intersection) on the west. The southwest corner of this rectangle was added to the village as the Hopkins Addition in 1881 with 95 more lots. Most of the Hopkins Addition lots are now occupied by the school, and to the south of the school, owned by the village.

In 1879, prior to the Hopkins Addition, the Smith Addition, which was then owned by Harriet L. Smith, Elisha J. Richmond, and Clara Richmond, added 25 lots to the northeast of the Smith Street – Main Street intersection.

(Six additional plats, the most recent in 1949, expanded the village to its current size, adding all the land between Smith Street and Russell Street. Numerous other plats around the lake created lots for lakeside homes and cottages.)

The 1880 census shows 1,258 people living in Bear Lake and Pleasanton townships, growing by 1890 to 1,880 people.

In 1877, Tyler W. Richmond established the Richmond Drug Company, which, after his death, was run by his wife, children, and grandson until Carl Richmond&#x27;s death in 1967. The store was in operation until 2020.

In fall 1893, the Village of Bear Lake was incorporated by action of the Board of Supervisors of Manistee County.

The 1900 census shows 2,087 people in the two townships, with 448 of them living in the village.

By June 9, 1902, all of the trees in the area had been cut. George W. Hopkins purchased over a hundred thousand acres in Florida (near Cape Canaveral) and he moved his business there, along with parts of the railway.

===Post lumber===
Industry shifted to predominantly agriculture, and later, summer tourism.

==Geography==
The village is in northwestern Manistee County on the south shore of a lake with the same name. U.S. Route 31 passes through the west and north sides of the village, leading southwest to Manistee, the county seat, and north to Benzonia.

<text>Manistee ( &quot;&quot;) is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located in southwestern Manistee County, it is part of the northwestern Lower Peninsula. Manistee is the county seat of Manistee County, and its population was 6,259 at the 2020 census. This makes Manistee the fifth-largest city in Northern Michigan.

Manistee is located on an isthmus between Manistee Lake and Lake Michigan, with the Manistee River bisecting the city as it flows west to the latter. Manistee is located along US 31, one of the major trunkline highways of the state.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Manistee&quot; is from an Ojibwe word first applied to the principal river of the county. The derivation is not certain, but it may be from &quot;ministigweyaa&quot;, &quot;river with islands at its mouth&quot;. Other sources claim that it was an Ojibwe term meaning &quot;spirit of the woods&quot;.

==History==

In 1751, a Jesuit mission was established in Manistee. Missionaries visited Manistee in the early 19th century, and a Jesuit mission house is known to have been located on the northwest shore of Manistee Lake in 1826. In 1832, a group of traders from Massachusetts built a log house up the Manistee River. However, they were soon driven off by the Odawa nation. The first white settlement and sawmill was built there in 1841.

In 1830 the village of Manistee was one of about 15 Odawa (Ottawa) villages along the shore of Lake Michigan. Much of the Manistee River Valley, including Manistee itself, was designated as an Odawa Reservation from 1836 to 1848.

The first permanent Euro-American settlement was made on April 16, 1841, when John Stronach and his son, Adam Stronach, arrived at the mouth of the Manistee River in a schooner loaded with fifteen men and equipment, and established a sawmill.

In 1846, the town was named &quot;Manistee&quot;; it was made part of Ottawa County, whose county offices were away at Grand Haven. After a series of new counties were organized, by 1855 Manistee was part of a large Manistee County that also included modern-day Wexford and Missaukee counties. Thomas Jefferson Ramsdell, Manistee&#x27;s first lawyer, moved there in 1860 and remained there until his death. Ramsdell owned the first hardware store in the city, and was responsible for the construction of a bridge across the Manistee River.

On October 8, 1871, the town was practically destroyed by fire; on the same day that the Peshtigo Fire, the Great Chicago Fire, and fires in Port Huron and Holland occurred, the Great Michigan Fire burned Manistee. Manistee was incorporated as a city in 1882.

===21st century===
In 2000, Manistee made national headlines after a local jury convicted a woman for expressing to her mother near a Hispanic family in a restaurant her wish that immigrants would learn English; the judge described it as &quot;insulting conduct&quot; consisting of &quot;fighting words&quot;, an offense that was punishable under a local ordinance. Allegations appeared of improper procedure and irregularities in the court records. Two years later (November 1, 2002) and after the defendant spent four nights in jail, the conviction was overturned by the state Court of Appeals.

==Geography==
Manistee is in southwestern Manistee County in northern Michigan, bordered to the west by Lake Michigan and to the east by Manistee Lake. The Manistee River connects the two lakes, cutting through the middle of the city. According to the United States Census Bureau, Manistee has a total area of , of which are land and , or 27.6%, are water. Neighboring and nearby communities include Parkdale to the northeast, Eastlake to the east, and Filer City, Oak Hill, and Stronach to the southeast. The townships that border Manistee are Filer to the south, Stronach to the southeast, and Manistee to the east and northeast.

U.S. Route 31 passes through the center of Manistee as Cypress Street. The highway leads northeast to Traverse City and south to the outskirts of Ludington. M-55 intersects US 31 in Parkdale, just east of Manistee, and leads east to Cadillac.

At the mouth of the Manistee River are the Manistee Pierhead lights (north and south piers) that were built in 1873, and replaced in 1927.

<text>Norman Township is a civil township of Manistee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,567 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Norman Township was formed in 1911 and named after Ed Norman. He was a surveyor and estimated, bought and sold timber, cutting a lot of it himself. He located here in about 1897, and in the second year, E. G. Filer, who owned the standing timber, donated the school house. Norman and his wife Elizabeth had 16 children.

During this time Ed was supervisor of Stronach Township. He cut limbs off his poplars at home and planted them along the road to Filer City. Mrs. Norman recalled that there was some criticism about it by a neighboring township. Residents from this section usually got what they wanted at Stronach. They thought it would be better to divide the township. Ed took about 200 men who were working on Stronach Dam over to vote and they won their point. Thus Norman township was formed in 1911.

<text>Onekama ( ) is a village in Manistee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 399 at the 2020 census. The village is located on the northeast shore of Portage Lake and is surrounded by Onekama Township. The town&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;Ona-ga-maa&quot;, an Anishinaabe word which means &quot;singing water&quot;.

==History==

The predecessor of the village of Onekama was the settlement of Portage at Portage Point, first established in 1845, at the western end of Portage Lake, at the outlet of Portage Creek. In 1871, when landowners around the land-locked lake became exasperated with the practices of the Portage Sawmill, they took the solution into their own hands and dug a channel through the narrow isthmus, opening a waterway that lowered the lake by and brought it to the same level as Lake Michigan. When this action dried out Portage Creek on May 14, 1871, the settlement, which had only the week before been designated as &quot;Onekama&quot; with a post office under that name, moved to the previously submerged land at the northeastern shore of the lake near an earlier settlement called &quot;Brookfield&quot;.

In 1880, the first public buildings were built in the new village. These included the Pierce gristmill and the Gibert brothers&#x27; sawmill. In 1882, the first school was built next to the present-day Congregational church. In 1883, a large summer hotel, the Glen House, was built near the Glen, with its three mineral springs that were believed to have medicinal value.

The village was incorporated in 1891 and included the earlier settlement known as Brookfield, creating a long narrow village about long, with the business section on the flat, former lake bottom and residences on the higher land.

In 1889, a branch of the Manistee and North-Eastern Railroad was extended to the village.

<text>Gwinn is an unincorporated community in Marquette County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is a census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes and has no legal status as an incorporated municipality. The population of the CDP was 1,784 at the 2020 census. The community is located within Forsyth Township.

The CDP includes the nearby communities of Austin to the west and New Swanzy to the east. It is located along M-35 near the forks of the east and middle branches of the Escanaba River. The Gwinn 49841 ZIP Code serves a much larger area, including most of Forsyth Township, as well as portions of Turin Township to the east, Wells and Ewing townships to the south, Tilden Township to the west, and Richmond, Sands, and West Branch townships to the north.

== History ==

The area was acquired by the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company (CCI) in 1902, which opened the Gwinn Mine in 1905. In 1906, the president of CCI, William Gwinn Mather, commissioned the well-known Boston landscape designer Warren H. Manning to design a residential community to support the mining operations. Mather named the community after his mother Elizabeth Lucy Gwinn. Streets were laid out and ground was broken for the first houses in 1907. Construction was primarily carried out between then and 1915. Manning emphasized Gwinn&#x27;s connection to the surrounding environment by preserving many of the existing trees and planting new ones. Eventually, over 8 percent of the cost of the town&#x27;s construction was allocated to outdoor improvements.

The community became known as a &quot;Model Town&quot;, a trace of which remains in the name for the local high school sports teams: the &quot;Modeltowners&quot;. It received a post office in 1908. Although it began as a company town, the direct involvement of Cleveland-Cliffs in the affairs of the Gwinn gradually decreased, and by the Great Depression the company had no hand in the operation of the town. Cleveland-Cliffs began divesting itself of real estate in the town, and by 1946 had sold the last of the houses it owned. The nearby Austin Mine was also operated by Cleveland-Cliffs, which developed the Austin community in 1911 to provide residences for miners and their families. Similarly, New Swanzy took its name from the Swanzy Iron Company, formed in 1883. The original Swanzy, located further to the northeast in Forsyth Township, was the site of the Escanaba River Land &amp; Iron Company. Swanzy was a station on the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad and had a post office from October 1889 until December 1905.

On June 24, 2002, Gwinn was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as the &quot;Gwinn Model Town Historic District, Forsyth Township, Marquette County, Michigan&quot;. The historic district encompasses the sections of Gwinn that were platted during the time Cleveland Cliffs was involved in the town&#x27;s affairs. Although the original Manning Plan for the town was never fully implemented, the section of town that was platted remains faithful to the Manning plan.

In 2015 it was rated by &quot;Business Insider&quot; as the most affordable town in Michigan.

<doc id="118060" wikidata="Q1873040" url="?curid=118060" title="K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base">
<text>K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base is a decommissioned United States Air Force (USAF) installation in Marquette County, Michigan, south of the city of Marquette. Near the center of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, the base operated for nearly forty years and closed in 1995. The county airport, Marquette Sawyer Regional Airport, now occupies a portion of the base and has scheduled airline flights and some general aviation activity.

The area of the former base is now an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes. The CDP is known as K. I. Sawyer and had a population of 3,064 at the 2020 census, up from 2,624 in 2010. It is located within Forsyth Township and West Branch Township about south of the city of Marquette.

==History==
The origins of K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base begin in the mid-1930s when Kenneth Ingalls Sawyer (1884–1944), a civil engineer and Marquette County road commissioner, desired to build an airport which would aid the development of the Marquette area. The one factor which most likely influenced the establishment and final location of the airport was the growing mining industry in the local area. As the demand for iron ore increased, the need for travel increased. By 1937, air service became a necessity, and county airport was built between Marquette and Negaunee.

The population of the area continued to grow, and by 1940, Sawyer realized the new Negaunee airport could not handle the ever-increasing demands. In 1941, the superintendent of the county highway department stepped out of his role and presented a plan for a new airport. The most significant landmarks on his proposed site were a hill of sand and a wealth of blueberry patches. The board agreed with the idea. Shortly thereafter, the United States was drawn into World War II. Local concern for the protection of the Great Lakes inter-lake navigation locks named Soo Locks at the trans-border area of Sault Ste. Marie prompted area citizens to propose that the U.S. Army Air Forces take over the new airfield. At that time, the proposal was shelved.

===K. I. Sawyer Airport===
Sawyer died in 1944, and the following year the airfield, consisting of a single airstrip, was completed and named K. I. Sawyer Airport in his honor. It was used by private fliers until 1948 when Nationwide Airlines became the first commercial airline to operate flights out of the airport. Nationwide flew shuttles to Detroit from Marquette, with stops in Escanaba, Iron Mountain, and Menominee.

In February 1954, the U.S. Air Force announced plans to enlarge its forces, and new bases were needed. The government entered into negotiations with the county for Sawyer&#x27;s lease, and offered to build a $12 million jet base which could be jointly used by the USAF and Marquette-area citizens. The major stipulation made by the government was no more than 300 landings per month could be made by civilian aircraft. In January 1955, a public meeting was held in the county courthouse to discuss the proposed lease. Many at this meeting voted to adopt a resolution urging the Marquette City Commission to accept the government&#x27;s offer.

===K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base===
On 24 Jan 1955, the U.S. government signed a 99-year lease. Almost immediately, construction of military support facilities began. About 850 people were employed during the construction of the base and another 262 were actively employed during the winter months. A letter from Secretary of the Air Force Harold E. Talbott to U.S. Senator Homer S. Ferguson was printed in &quot;The Mining Journal&quot; and reported more than 900 military personnel were to be stationed at K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base with an annual income in excess of $3 million. K. I. Sawyer Airport officially opened as a joint civil-military facility on 8 April 1956, and it was not long before the USAF proposed a $447,000 appropriation for construction of a civil airport in Negaunee Township, which would allow the Air Force sole use of the base.

USAF facilities constructed included a and runway. Additionally, the region&#x27;s wide open airspace offers ease of operations for an extremely safe and delay free air traffic setting. The official opening of K. I. Sawyer AFB occurred on 8 May 1959, at which time the airfield became a strictly military operation.

====Air Defense Command====

Upon activation, K. I. Sawyer was placed under the Jurisdiction of Air Defense Command (ADC) on 8 April 1956. The 473d Fighter Group was activated as the host unit, under the ADC 4706th Air Defense Wing at O&#x27;Hare International Airport, Illinois.

The initial mission of the base was to act as a fighter-interceptor defense against an enemy bomber attack, the 484th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was activated on 8 June 1956, and authorized F-89D Scorpion interceptors, however the 484th FIS was never equipped or manned as much construction was necessary to bring the airport up to USAF standards for a military airfield. In 1957, civilian commercial operations from the base moved to a new Marquette County Airport erected at the site of the old Negaunee Airport. The first aircraft assigned to K. I. Sawyer were F-102 Delta Daggers from the 438th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Kincheloe AFB, which were temporarily stationed at K. I. Sawyer during the summer of 1958.

On 8 November 1958 the Sault Sainte Marie Air Defense Sector (SsmADS) was established at K. I. Sawyer AFB. The ADC command and control organization&#x27;s mission was to operate the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-14), which opened in 1959. The SAGE system was a network linking USAF (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for air defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. SsmADS also supported the Antigo AFS (P-19) and Calumet AFS (P-16) ADC Ground-Controlled Interception (GCI) and warning stations

Further expansion of the base occurred in 1959 when the runway was extended to its final length at . Prior to the expansion, ADC replaced the 473d Fighter Group with the 56th Fighter Wing, along with its 62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, to Sawyer as the host unit. The 56th FW received its first aircraft, a McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, in 1959, after the expanded runway was completed. The F-101s provided the SAGE unit with the required intercept and destroy capabilities that gave the base teeth.

In 1961 the 56th Fighter Wing was discontinued and the host unit at Sawyer became the Sault Sainte Marie ADS. In a reorganization in 1964, SAC assumed jurisdiction of the base and ADC phased down its presence to a tenant organization. The 62d FIS came under the command and control of the Duluth Air Defense Sector and the SsmADS was inactivated. Responsibilities for the SAGE system were switched to the Duluth ADS, (DC-10) or the Detroit Air Defense Sector (DC-06).

In 1969, Air Defense Command was redesignated as Aerospace Defense Command. In 1971, the 62d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and its F-101B was replaced with a new squadron and aircraft. The new squadron was the 87th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (87 FIS), the &quot;Red Bulls,&quot; which flew the F-106A Delta Dart. The 87th maintained four Lockheed T-33 aircraft to provide target support for the squadron interceptors, simulating Soviet bomber tactics. In addition, they flew NORAD radar evaluation and logistic support sorties.

ADC was disestablished in 1979 and all ADC aircraft assets were transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC) under a sub-organization known as Air Defense – Tactical Air Command (ADTAC). The 87 FIS and their F-106 aircraft remained based and maintaining a 24/7/365 alert status at Sawyer AFB. The 87th was scheduled to convert to the F-15 Eagle in 1984. However, due to budget cuts the conversion was cancelled and the squadron was scheduled for inactivation on 1 October 1985 as the continental air defense mission in the United States was increasingly transferred to the Air National Guard. When inactivated, the 87th FIS was the second-to-last F-106 squadron on active duty.

On 4 September 1985, the last three F-106 Delta Darts from the 87th FIS departed K. I. Sawyer for AMARC at Davis-Monthan AFB at Tucson, Arizona. Most of its aircraft were later converted to QF-106 target drones and expended as aerial targets over the Gulf of Mexico as part of the &quot;Pacer Six Program&quot; during the late 1990s at Tyndall AFB in western Florida by the 82d Aerial Targets Squadron.

====Strategic Air Command====
The Strategic Air Command (SAC) became a tenant organization at K. I. Sawyer AFB on 1 August 1958 with the organization of the 4042d Strategic Wing. The 4042d SW was a B-52H Stratofortress dispersal wing, a part of SAC&#x27;s plan to disperse its big bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike.

Before receiving the KC-135A tanker and heavy B-52H bomber aircraft of SAC, an all-weather, heavy-duty concrete runway was built, measuring thick and wide. It was extended in 1959 from , overruns of . There are also shoulders on each side of the runway, providing a paved width of .

The two operational units to be assigned later to this wing were the 923d Air Refueling Squadron on 1 May 1960, and the 526th Bombardment Squadron on 1 June 1961. The refueling squadron&#x27;s first KC-135A aircraft arrived 4 August 1960, and the unit was declared fully combat ready in November of that year.
In April 1961, the 923d was inactivated and the 46th Air Refueling Squadron organized and activated as a replacement unit. The first B-52H aircraft assigned to the 526th arrived at Sawyer in August 1961. On 1 February 1963, the 4042d Strategic Wing was discontinued and the 410th Bombardment Wing (Heavy) organized and activated with no change in mission, personnel or aircraft. Also on that date, the 644th Bombardment Squadron was activated replacing the 526th, and the 46th Air Refueling Squadron was reassigned to the 410th. The majority of the wing&#x27;s present support squadrons were also activated on this date as well.

On 1 January 1964, SAC assumed jurisdiction of Sawyer AFB, with the 410th Bomb Wing becoming the host unit under the 4th Strategic Aerospace Division. K. I. Sawyer was one of three SAC bases in Michigan that operated the B-52: the others were Kincheloe AFB to the east, near Kinross, south of Sault Ste. Marie, and Wurtsmith AFB, in the northeast of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, near Oscoda.

The 410th and its subordinate units&#x27; mission was to operate at full readiness, and support activities included aircraft and vehicle maintenance, bombing crew and unit training, and air refueling support. The wing did not deploy bomber aircraft to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, as the B-52H was dedicated to strategic deterrence. However, the tanker aircraft and aircrews participated in the &quot;Young Tiger&quot; TDY effort, and the bomber aircrews went through RTU (Replacement Training Unit) training to fly B-52Ds out of Andersen AFB, Guam and U-Tapao RTAFB, Thailand and were active participants in many of the notable campaigns that took place in Southeast Asia, such as Operation Arc Light.

One Sawyer KC-135A (61-0313) became famous throughout the SAC community as &quot;the glider&quot; when it ran out of fuel on a short final approach prior to landing at its home base after flying practice approaches at nearby Kincheloe AFB to complete requalification training. The flight crew, with the exception of the instructor pilot, bailed out when the engines went quiet. The instructor pilot, who remained on board, landed the aircraft just short of the runway overrun, bounced and rolled to a stop on the runway. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service quickly and even the crew entry door (which separated from the aircraft during bailout procedures) was returned to the USAF by a local farmer.

Other aircraft assigned to K. I. Sawyer over the years included HH-43B and HH-1H rescue helicopters of the 48th and 39th Air Rescue and Recovery Wings at Eglin AFB, Florida at the K. I. Sawyer Helicopter (later re-designated Training) Annex, 14 March 1975 to 1 October 1977. SAC FB-111 bombers assigned to the 509th Bombardment Wing (Medium) from Pease AFB in New Hampshire, on satellite alert at Sawyer in 1974 and 1975.

In the early 1980s, K. I. Sawyer&#x27;s B-52s were modified to carry the new Boeing AGM-86 Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM). The ALCM was powered by a . Williams F107-WR-100 turbofan, which is fed by an inlet which folds out on the top of the missile. The B-52 could carry six AGM-86Bs on each of the two underwing pylons. In 1980, two B-52H crews assigned to the 644th Bomb Squadron (S-21 and S-31) were awarded the Mackay Trophy for &quot;executing a nonstop, around-the-world mission with the immediate objective of locating and photographing elements of the Soviet Navy operating in the Persian Gulf.&quot; The Wing Commander at this time was Col G. Alan Dugard, a great leader and author of the 2011 book about the Operation Linebacker II missions of 1972, titled &quot;When the Wolf Rises.&quot;

===Closure===
In 1993, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission of the federal government (BRAC 1993) recommended the base for closure.

The KC-135 tankers departed in October 1993 and the B-52H&#x27;s were split between the two remaining B-52 bases, Barksdale AFB and Minot AFB; Sawyer&#x27;s final B-52 left for Minot in November 1994.

The last aircraft assigned to Sawyer were six T-37 Tweet jet trainers of the 71st Flying Training Wing assigned to &quot;Accelerated Copilot Enrichment Program&quot; in 1977 and were later assigned to the &quot;Companion Trainer Program&quot; under Air Combat Command. K. I. Sawyer AFB was officially closed at the end of September 1995.

The closure of K. I. Sawyer had a major negative economic impact on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. With 12,000 people, the base and the area around it functioned as the Upper Peninsula&#x27;s second-largest city, and the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s annual spending in the region totaled $157 million. , Marquette County was projected to lose 20 percent of its economy. In the end, the closure led to the loss of 5,000 jobs and 14,000 residents. , the town around the base had a reputation as a troubled area with a slew of abandoned and boarded-up buildings.

===Legacy===
K. I. Sawyer was a favorite base among the SAC community. Although isolated and definitely northern, it was an attractive base for its pleasing North Woods location and its proximity to outdoor activities off the base, including hunting, fishing, boating, and winter sports including skiing at Marquette Mountain (known as &quot;Cliffs Ridge&quot; before 1982), as well as the venues on site (base lake, ski hill, and others).

While the base was sometimes referred to as &quot;K. I. Siberia&quot; or &quot;The Rock&quot; and there was an abundance of lake-effect snow, it was not the bitter sub-zero temperatures and wind chills and hot summers of the tree-sparse North Dakota bases, or the confinement of the bases in the more established communities of the northeastern states. Locals maintained that the K. I. Sawyer runway was built over some of the best blueberry fields in the state. Berry patches remained on many other parts of the base, and families of aircrew members often picked them near the alert barracks and the family center.

A portion of the operational section of K. I. Sawyer AFB has been converted into Marquette Sawyer Regional Airport, which opened its passenger terminal for service as Sawyer International Airport in September 1999. It replaced the smaller Marquette County Airport, just southwest of Marquette, as the region&#x27;s primary civilian airport.

In recent years, a group of local citizens interested in preserving the historical significance of the base have collected six aircraft of the types used actively at various times through the base&#x27;s history to be displayed near the airport. The program is known as the &quot;Sawyer 6&quot; project. The aircraft are part of the K. I. Sawyer Heritage Air Museum, which also has exhibits in the base&#x27;s former Silver Wings Recreation Center.

<text>Negaunee ( or ) is a city in Marquette County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,627 at the 2020 census. The city is located at the southwest corner of Negaunee Township, which is administratively separate, in the Upper Peninsula. The city is home to a luge track. The name &quot;Negaunee&quot; comes from an Anishinabemowin (Ojibwe) word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;foremost, in advance, leading,&quot; which was determined to be the closest Ojibwe translation for &quot;pioneer&quot;. Within the city limits is Teal Lake.

==History==
The city was built after the discovery of the Marquette Iron Range during the early 19th century. The Jackson Mine was established in 1845 to mine the ore for shipment to iron forges; the first such forge to operate in the Lake Superior basin was set up in Negaunee during this period. In 1858, the community was given a post office. In 1865, Negaunee was incorporated as a village and reincorporated as a city in 1873. As mining operations expanded, many immigrants helped settle the area, bringing with them rich traditions that remain today. Due to extensive underground mining, roughly half the city was abandoned in the early 20th century due to risk of cave-in. The city closed its trolley system in 1927. The Jackson Mine ceased all operations within the city limits in the 1940s.

On January 16, 1952, Negaunee became the smallest city to ever host an NBA game. The Milwaukee Hawks beat the Baltimore Bullets 77–71. Baltimore&#x27;s Don Barksdale led all scorers with 24 points. Negaunee is still the smallest city to ever host any of the four major North American professional sports.

Negaunee is also the home of Suicide Hill Ski Jump, a ski jump training facility where the Ishpeming Ski Club prepares skiers for classic cross country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping competitions.

<doc id="118090" wikidata="Q2161723" url="?curid=118090" title="Ludington, Michigan">
<text>Ludington ( ) is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is the county seat and the largest city in Mason County. The population was 7,655 at the 2020 census.

The city is located at the mouth of the Pere Marquette River at Lake Michigan. Nearby are Ludington State Park (which includes the Big Sable Point Light), Nordhouse Dunes Wilderness, and Manistee National Forest. Ludington is the home port of the SS &quot;Badger&quot;, a vehicle and passenger ferry with daily service in the summer across Lake Michigan to Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

==History==

In 1675, Father Jacques Marquette, French missionary and explorer, died and was laid to rest near the modern site of Ludington. A memorial and iron cross were built in 1955 to mark the location.

In 1845, Burr Caswell moved to the area near the mouth of the Pere Marquette River as a location for trapping and fishing. In July 1847, when he brought his family to live there, they became the first permanent residents of European ancestry. Two years later they built a two-story wood-framed house on their farm. After the organization of Mason County in 1855, the first floor of this building was converted into the county&#x27;s first courthouse. Restored in 1976 by the Mason County Historical Society, the structure stands today as a part of White Pine Village, a museum consisting of several restored and replica Mason County buildings (see external links).

The town was originally named Pere Marquette, then later named after the industrialist James Ludington, whose logging operations the village developed around. Ludington was incorporated as a city in 1873, the same year that the county seat was moved from the village of Lincoln to the city of Ludington. The area&#x27;s population boom in the late 19th century was due to these sawmills and also the discovery of salt deposits.

By 1892, 162 million board feet () of lumber and 52 million wood shingles had been produced by the Ludington sawmills. With all of this commerce occurring, Ludington became a major Great Lakes shipping port.

In 1875, the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad (F&amp;PM) began cross-lake shipping operations with the sidewheel steamer SS &quot;John Sherman&quot;. It became apparent quite early that the John Sherman was not large enough to handle the volume of freight, and the F&amp;PM Railroad contracted with the Goodrich Line of Steamers to handle the break bulk freight out of the Port of Ludington.

In 1897, the F&amp;PM railroad constructed the first steel car ferry, the &quot;Pere Marquette&quot;. This was the beginning of the creation of a fleet of ferries to continue the rail cargo across Lake Michigan to Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The fleet was later expanded to carry cars and passengers across the lake. By the mid-1950s, Ludington had become the largest car ferry port in the world. Unfortunately, due to disuse and declining industry, the fleet eventually dwindled. Currently only one carferry, the SS &quot;Badger&quot;, makes regular trips across the lake from Ludington, one of only two lake-crossing car ferries on Lake Michigan.

During the late 1910s and early 1920s, Ludington was the home of the Ludington Mariners minor league baseball team.

==Geography==
Ludington is in western Mason County, on the east shore of Lake Michigan and north shore of its inlet, Pere Marquette Lake. It is north of Muskegon, south of Manistee, Michigan, and west of Reed City.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Ludington has a total area of , of which are land and , or 6.80%, are water.

The Ludington North Breakwall Light is at the end of the north pierhead on Lake Michigan. Ludington is part of Northern Michigan.

==Climate==
Ludington has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) bordering on the hot-summer subtype &quot;Dfa&quot; seen further south in Michigan. Winters are cold and snowy, and summers too are moderated by Lake Michigan, with the record high being below .

==Transportation==
All four highways in Mason County go through, or near Ludington.
