<text>Nutley is a township in Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 30,143, an increase of 1,773 (+6.2%) from the 2010 census count of 28,370, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,008 (+3.7%) from the 27,362 counted in the 2000 census.

What is now Nutley was originally incorporated as Franklin Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 18, 1874, from portions of Belleville Township. Nutley was incorporated as a town on March 5, 1902, replacing Franklin Township. In 1981, the town was one of seven Essex County municipalities to pass a referendum to become a township, joining four municipalities that had already made the change, of what would ultimately be more than a dozen Essex County municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships in order take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis.

Nutley derived its name from the estate of the Satterthwaite family, established in 1844, which stretched along the Passaic River and from an artist&#x27;s colony in the area.

==History==

Nutley grew slowly as Newark developed. The first European settler in the area, recorded in the minutes of a Newark town meeting in 1693, was a Dutch planter named Bastian Van Giesen. His son had a home constructed after inheriting the property in 1751 and is now known as Vreeland Homestead. It still stands today on Chestnut Street and was the location of the Nutley Women&#x27;s Club from 1912 until 2012 when it was sold to the township. The Van Riper House is another building from the era. During the revolutionary war, the Continental Army, under the command of General George Washington, retreated from New York through Essex County and what is now Nutley.

The first brownstone quarry in Nutley is believed to have been in operation by the early 18th century and was the town&#x27;s first major industry. Jobs at the brownstone quarry in the Avondale section of Nutley provided work for many Italian and Irish immigrants. Mills situated along the Third River in the area now known as Memorial Park I became Nutley&#x27;s second major industry.

John and Thomas Speer, Joseph Kingsland, and Henry Duncan all operated mills in the town during the 1800s. Current streets in Nutley are named after these mill owners. Henry Duncan built several mills throughout the town and established the village of Franklinville consisting of 30 homes and a few small businesses which later became the center of Nutley. One of Duncan&#x27;s buildings has been modified and now serves as the town hall. Kingsland Manor is a national historic place.

During the late 1880s, painter Frank Fowler founded an artists&#x27; colony on The Enclosure, a dead-end street that is near the Third River, a stream that runs through the town&#x27;s parks. Later artist residents of the street included Frederick Dana Marsh, Reginald Marsh and muralist Michael Lenson.

Nutley&#x27;s town historian, John Demmer, is the author of the book in the &quot;Images of America&quot; series titled &quot;Nutley&quot;; Demmer is also part of The Nutley Historical Society, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to serve the educational, cultural and historical needs of the community. The Nutley Historical Society manages the operation of The Nutley Historical Museum, housed in a former town schoolhouse at 65 Church Street.

Several other historical works on Nutley have been written by local historians, notably the late Ann Troy&#x27;s &quot;Nutley: Yesterday – Today&quot;; &quot;Nutley&quot; by Marilyn Peters and Richard O&#x27;Connor in the &quot;Then and Now&quot; series; and books about the Nutley Velodrome. The board track racing facility was used in the 1930s for racing midget cars. Local resident Chris Economaki wrote extensively about the Nutley Velodrome in his autobiographical racing history &quot;Let Them All Go!&quot; as the Velodrome was the first racetrack he had visited as a child.

<text>The City of Orange (known simply as Orange) is a township in Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 34,447, an increase of 4,313 (+14.3%) from the 2010 census count of 30,134, which in turn reflected a decline of 2,734 (-8.3%) from the 32,868 counted in the 2000 census.

The New Jersey Legislature originally incorporated Orange as a township on November 27, 1806, from parts of Newark Township. Parts of the township were taken on April 14, 1834, to form the now-defunct Clinton Township. On January 31, 1860, Orange was reincorporated as a town. Parts of the town were taken to form South Orange Township (April 1, 1861, now known as Maplewood), Fairmount (March 11, 1862, now part of West Orange), East Orange Township (March 4, 1863) and West Orange Township (April 10, 1863). On April 3, 1872, Orange was reincorporated as a city. In 1982, the city was one of four Essex County municipalities to pass a referendum to become a township, joining 11 municipalities that had already made the change, of what ultimately were more than a dozen Essex County municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships to take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis. The city derives its name from William III of England or William IV, Prince of Orange.

Despite the differences in the municipalities&#x27; character, Orange, East Orange, South Orange and West Orange are sometimes jointly called The Oranges.

In 2020, the township had New Jersey&#x27;s 12th-highest property tax rate, with an equalized rate of 4.679% compared to 2.824% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==History==
Orange has its origins in Connecticut&#x27;s New Haven Colony. In 1666, 30 of New Haven&#x27;s families traveled by water to found &quot;a town on the Passayak&quot; River. They arrived on territory now encompassing Newark, the Oranges, and several other municipalities. The area was in the northeast portion of a land grant conveyed by King Charles II of England to his brother James, Duke of York. In 1664, James conveyed the land to two proprietors, Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. Since Carteret had been Royal Governor of the Isle of Jersey, the territory became known as &quot;New Jersey.&quot;

Orange was initially part of the city of Newark, but it was originally known as &quot;Newark Mountains&quot;. On June 7, 1780, the townspeople of Newark Mountains officially voted to adopt the name Orange. At the time, a significant number of people favored secession from Newark. This did not occur until November 27, 1806, when the territory now encompassing all of the Oranges was finally detached.

On April 13, 1807, the first government was elected, but not until March 13, 1860, was Orange officially incorporated as a city. Immediately, the new city began fragmenting into smaller communities, primarily because of local disputes about the costs of establishing paid police, fire, and street departments. South Orange was organized on January 26, 1861; Fairmount (later to become part of West Orange) on March 11, 1862; East Orange on March 4, 1863; and West Orange (including Fairmount) on March 14, 1863.

===Early center of transportation===

Orange is on the Newark and Mount-Pleasant Turnpike, the main road from Newark to Morristown, and ultimately to Easton, Pennsylvania. The town became a busy thoroughfare for travelers, and hotels abounded. Initially, the stagecoach was the primary method of transportation. Omnibuses of the Eclipse and the Morris &amp; Newark Lines serviced Orange.

The Morris and Essex Railroad arrived in Orange in November 1836, its first cars drawn by horses. On October 2, 1837, the first steam locomotive appeared, and the horses were, with minor exception, relegated to pasture. The &quot;M&amp;E&quot; later became a part of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W), which exists today as NJ Transit&#x27;s Morristown Line.

Trolley cars appeared much later, with the Orange and Newark Horse Car Railroad Company running its first car up Main Street in May 1862. The Orange Crosstown Line, eventually extending from Morris Street, Orange, to Bloomfield, was started in June 1888. (The first electric trolley in the State of New Jersey operated over a section of this line.) Eventually, all the trolleys, and the buses that replaced them, became part of the sprawling Public Service Coordinated Transport System.

Orange became an industrial city early in its history, with the tanning industry expanding rapidly after settlers found growths of hemlock trees that were a source for the tannic acid they needed, leading to the growth of many factories producing shoes and boots.

Orange was once the United States&#x27; hat-making capital. The industry can be traced there to 1792. By 1892, 21 firms were engaged in that trade, employing over 3,700 people in plants that produced about 4.8 million hats, which had a combined value in excess of $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Several brothers founded the &quot;No-Name Hat Company&quot; in Orange before one of them moved on to make fedoras in Philadelphia under the family name, &quot;Stetson.&quot; By 1921, only five hat-making firms were left, many having departed for places such as Norwalk and Danbury, Connecticut. By 1960, all had left.

Beer was a major industry in Orange beginning in the early 1900s, when the three Winter Brothers of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, arrived in the city and built the first brewery. The Orange Brewery was constructed in 1901 at a reported cost of $350,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The production of beer ceased with prohibition in 1920, and after the repeal of the Volstead Act in 1933, the brewery was sold to John F. Trommers of Philadelphia. Trommers brewed beer under that label until 1950, when the concern was again sold to Liebmann Breweries, Incorporated, which bottled Rheingold Beer. Eventually, after passing through several other owners, the plant was closed permanently in 1977.

Other notable firms in Orange were the Monroe Calculating Company, manufacturers of the adding machines of the same name, and the Bates Manufacturing Company, producers of office accessories such as staplers and stampers.

The United States Radium Corporation refined ore and extracted the radium used to make luminous paint for dials and hands of watches and other indicators. Years later, the carcinogenic effects of this material became known, and the polluted site of the factory became a liability for the city.

===Famous residents and visitors===
Orange has produced such notables as baseball&#x27;s Monte Irvin and heavyweight boxer Tony Galento. Actor William Bendix lived and worked here for a short while. Presidents, presidential candidates, and governors visited. Orange held major celebrations for its 100th anniversary, and another when it turned 150.

===Late 20th century political and social changes===

Once a multi-ethnic, economically diverse city, Orange suffered indirectly from the 1967 riots in Newark (even though Newark and Orange do not share a border) and directly from the construction of Interstate 280 through the heart of the downtown area, triggering middle-class &quot;white flight&quot; from aging industrial towns to the new automobile suburbs being built in western Essex County and elsewhere. By the end of the 1970s, Orange had many of the urban ills normally associated with larger cities. However, the city still features many tree-lined streets with well-maintained homes.

In 1982, citizens voted overwhelmingly to change the designation of Orange from a city to a township, thereby making it eligible for federal Revenue Sharing funds. In 1985, the State of New Jersey named Orange as a State Urban Enterprise Zone, creating tax breaks and investment incentives.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 2.22 square miles (5.74 km2), including 2.21 square miles (5.73 km2) of land and &lt;0.01 square miles (0.01 km2) of water (0.09%).

The East Branch of the Rahway River travels through Orange.

Orange borders the Essex County municipalities of East Orange, Glen Ridge, Montclair, South Orange and West Orange.

<text>Roseland is a borough in western Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 6,299, an increase of 480 (+8.2%) from the 2010 census count of 5,819, which in turn reflected an increase of 521 (+9.8%) from the 5,298 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Roseland was part of the Horseneck Tract, which was an area that consisted of what are now the municipalities of Caldwell, West Caldwell, North Caldwell, Fairfield, Verona, Cedar Grove, Essex Fells, Roseland, and portions of Livingston and West Orange. In 1702, settlers purchased the Horseneck Tract—so-called because of its irregular shape that suggested a horse&#x27;s neck and head—from the Lenni Lenape Native Americans for goods equal to $325. This purchase encompassed much of western Essex County, from the First Mountain to the Passaic River.

Originally named Centerville, the name of the community was changed in 1874 to Roseland to avoid confusion with the several other Centervilles spread across the state, most specifically Centerville, Hunterdon County, New Jersey, which already had a post office under that name. Roseland was chosen over the alternative proposed name of &quot;Roselyn&quot;.

One of the most notable places of interest in the borough was the Becker Farm Railroad, otherwise known as the Centerville &amp; Southwestern Railroad. A miniature railroad operated from 1938 until 1972 on the Becker Farm, which once comprised nearly half of the total area within Roseland and which is now mostly a large business complex. Some vestiges of the railroad still exist.

In 1907, a delegation of residents petitioned Livingston Township officials to construct a school for the growing population in Roseland. The rejection of their request led to the efforts to create an independent municipality, which was established on April 10, 1908.

Roseland was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 10, 1908, from portions of Livingston Township.

<doc id="125183" wikidata="Q656185" url="?curid=125183" title="South Orange, New Jersey">
<text>South Orange is a historic suburban village located in Essex County, New Jersey. It was formally known as the Township of South Orange Village from October 1978 until April 25, 2024. As of the 2020 United States census, the village population was 18,484, an increase of 2,286 (+14.1%) from the 2010 census count of 16,198, which in turn reflected a decline of 766 (−4.5%) from the 16,964 counted in the 2000 census. Seton Hall University is located in the township.

&quot;The time and circumstances under which the name South Orange originated will probably never be known,&quot; wrote historian William H. Shaw in 1884, &quot;and we are obliged to fall back on a tradition, that Mr. Nathan Squier first used the name in an advertisement offering wood for sale&quot; in 1795. Other sources attribute the derivation for all of the Oranges to King William III, Prince of Orange.

Of the 564 municipalities in New Jersey, South Orange Village is one of only four with a village type of government; the others are Loch Arbour, Ridgefield Park and Ridgewood.

On March 11, 2024, the governing body adopted a change to its charter under which &quot;township&quot; was dropped from the municipality&#x27;s name, the name of the governing body and its leader became the council and mayor (rather than board of trustees and president of the board of trustees) and municipal elections were shifted from May to November (which will shift term-end dates for all current elected officials from May to December 31); these changes took full effect on April 25, 2024, after 45 days have passed from the adoption of the ordinance.

==History==

South Orange Village dates back to May 4, 1869, when it was formed within South Orange Township (now Maplewood). On March 4, 1904, the Village of South Orange was created by an act of the New Jersey Legislature and separated from South Orange Township. In 1978, the village&#x27;s name was changed by referendum to &quot;The Township of South Orange Village&quot;, becoming the first of more than a dozen Essex County municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships in order to take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis.

What is now South Orange was part of a territory purchased from the Lenape Native Americans in 1666 by Robert Treat, who founded Newark that year on the banks of the Passaic River. The unsettled areas north and west of Newark were at first referred to as the uplands. South Orange was called the Chestnut Hills for a time.

There are two claimants to the first English settlement in present-day South Orange. In 1677 brothers Joseph and Thomas Brown began clearing land for a farm in the area northwest of the junction of two old trails that are now South Orange Avenue and Ridgewood Road. A survey made in 1686 states, &quot;note this Land hath a House on it, built by Joseph Brown and Thomas Brown, either of them having an equal share of it&quot; located at the present southwest corner of Tillou Road and Ridgewood Road. Minutes of a Newark town meeting of September 27, 1680, record that &quot;Nathaniel Wheeler, Edward Riggs, and Joseph Riggs, have a Grant to take up Land upon the Chesnut Hill by Rahway River near the Stone House&quot;. The phrasing shows that a stone house already existed near (not on) the property. Joseph Riggs (seemingly the son of Edward Riggs) had a house just south of the Browns&#x27; house, at the northwest corner of South Orange Avenue and Ridgewood Road, according to a road survey of 1705. The same road survey locates Edward Riggs&#x27;s residence near Millburn and Nathaniel Wheeler&#x27;s residence in modern West Orange at the corner of Valley Road and Main Street.

Wheeler&#x27;s property in South Orange extended east of the Rahway River including the site of an old house now known as the &quot;Stone House&quot;, standing on the north side of South Orange Avenue just to the west of Grove Park. By 1756 or earlier this property was owned by Samuel Pierson. A survey of adjoining property in 1767 mentions &quot;Pierson&#x27;s house&quot; forming accidentally the earliest documentation of a house on the property, which may be much older. Bethuel Pierson, son of Samuel, lived in this house and when he inherited it in 1773/74 he was said to live &quot;at the mountain plantation by a certain brook called Stone House Brook.&quot; Sometime during his ownership (he died in 1791) &quot;Bethuel Pierson had a stone addition added to his dwelling-house, which he caused to be dedicated by religious ceremonies&quot;. This would appear to be the stone-walled portion of the &quot;Stone House&quot;. Stone House Brook runs west along the north side of the east–west road, past the &quot;Stone House&quot; and joining the Rahway River at about the location of the Brown and Riggs houses already noted. The oldest parts of the Pierson house are the oldest surviving structure in South Orange.
A deed of 1800 locates a property as being in &quot;the Township of Newark, in the Parish of Orange, at a place called South Orange&quot;, marking the end of the name Chestnut Hills. Orange had been named after the ruler of England, William of Orange. Most of modern South Orange became part of Orange Township in 1806, part of Clinton Township in 1834, and part of South Orange Township in 1861. South Orange Village split off from South Orange Township in 1869 due to the desire for extensive privileges in the conduct of public affairs. South Orange Village became a haven for those who wanted freedom from the commotion of city life after the end of the American Civil War. A majority of South Orange Township became what is now known as Maplewood, New Jersey. Gordon&#x27;s Gazetteer circa 1830 describes the settlement as having &quot;about 30 dwellings, a tavern and store, a paper mill and Presbyterian church&quot;.

A country resort called the Orange Mountain House was established in 1847 on Ridgewood Road in present-day West Orange, where guests could enjoy the &quot;water cure&quot; from natural spring water and walk in the grounds that extended up the slope of South Mountain. The hotel burned down in 1890. The only remnants today are the names of Mountain Station and the Mountain House Road leading west from it to the site of the hotel.

South Orange could be reached by the Morris and Essex Railroad which opened in 1837 between Newark and Morristown. As of 1869, the M&amp;E became part of the main line of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad which ran from Hoboken to Buffalo with through trains to Chicago.

The Montrose neighborhood was developed after the Civil War. Its large houses on generous lots attracted wealthy families from Newark and New York City during the decades from 1870 to 1900. The Orange Lawn Tennis Club was founded in 1880 at a location in Montrose, and in 1886 it was the location of the first US national tennis championships. The club moved to larger grounds on Ridgewood Road in 1916. Major tournament events were held at the club throughout the grass court era, and even into the mid-1980s professional events would occasionally be held there.

What is now the Baird Community House was up until about 1920 the clubhouse for a golf course that encompassed what is now Meadowlands Park. Until regrading was performed during the 1970s, the outline of one of the course&#x27;s sand traps was still visible near the base of Flood&#x27;s Hill, a spot that has historically been one of the favorite sledding spots in Essex County.

The construction of Village Hall in 1894 and the &quot;old&quot; library building in 1896 indicate how the village was growing by that date. Horsecar service from Newark started in 1865, running via South Orange Avenue to the station. Electric trolley cars began running the line in 1893 and by about 1900 a branch of this line also ran down Valley Street into Maplewood. Another separate trolley line, eventually dubbed the &quot;Swamp Line&quot;, ran from the west side of the station north through what is now park land and along Meadowbrook Lane into West Orange where it ended at Main Street. An old postcard photo shows a station shelter at Montrose Ave. The DL&amp;W rebuilt the railroad through town in 1914–1916, raising the tracks above street level and opening new station buildings at South Orange and Mountain Station. In September 1930, a frail Thomas Edison (he would die about a year later) inaugurated electric train service on the M&amp;E between Hoboken and South Orange, with further extensions of service to Morristown and Dover being initiated over the coming months.

The South Orange Library Association was organized by William Beebe, president of the Republican Club, where on November 14, 1864, a group of men and women met. Books were donated and the library was established in a corner room on the second floor of the Republican Club where it remained until 1867 when it was moved to a second floor room of the building next door on South Orange Avenue, near Sloan Street. It stayed there until 1884, when the building, with the library still on its second floor, was moved by horses up South Orange Avenue to the northwest corner of Scotland Road. Although supported as yet only by members&#x27; dues and a few gifts of money which were put into an endowment fund, in 1886 a new association was formed to establish a free circulating library and reading room which took over the loan books and other property of the old association. It was during this period, before Village Hall was built, that Village Trustees met in the Library&#x27;s room. On May 1, 1889, the library was moved to a ground floor space at 59 South Orange Avenue.

At an annual meeting in 1895, Library Trustees considered the question of obtaining a library building and Eugene V. Connett&#x27;s offer of a library site on the corner of Scotland Road and Taylor Place, once a $7,500 subscription was met (equivalent to $ in ). On May 8, 1896, the library was moved into the building on that corner. A referendum held on April 27, 1926, showed that citizens had voted ten to one in favor of the town taking over full support of the library. It thereupon became &quot;The South Orange Public Library.&quot; In February 1929, the Village Trustees passed an ordinance providing funds to construct a rear wing on the library and to provide a Children&#x27;s Room in the basement, book stacks and a balcony on the floor above, together with rehabilitation work on the older part of the building. In November 1968, the new library building on the corner of Scotland Road and Comstock Place was dedicated.

 Good transportation and a booming economy caused South Orange and neighboring communities to begin a major transformation in the 1920s into bedroom communities for Newark and New York City. Large houses were built in the blocks around the Orange Lawn Tennis club, while in other areas, especially south of South Orange Avenue, more modest foursquare houses were constructed. The only large area not developed by 1930 was the high ground west of Wyoming Avenue.

There were two rock quarries within the village supplying trap rock for construction. Kernan&#x27;s operated as late as the 1980s at the top of Tillou Road. The village&#x27;s other larger businesses were lumber and coal yards clustered around the railroad station that supplied them. The business district is still located in the blocks just east of the station.

The old Morris and Essex Railroad is operated today by NJ Transit. Midtown Direct, initiated in 1996, offers service directly into Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, and has since caused a surge in real estate prices as the commute time to midtown dropped from about 50 minutes to 35, as the service eliminated the need for passengers to transfer to PATH trains at Hoboken. As a result, demand for commuter parking permits in lots adjoining the train and bus stations is extremely high, with a waiting list as long as five years for commuter parking spots.

===Local character===

The village is one of only a few in New Jersey to retain gas light street illumination (others include Riverton, Palmyra, Trenton Mill Hill neighborhood, and Glen Ridge). The gaslight, together with the distinctive Village Hall, has long been the symbol of South Orange. Many of the major roads in town do have modern mercury vapor streetlights (built into gaslight frames), but most of the residential sections of the town are still gas-lit. A proposal to replace all the gaslights in town with electric streetlights was explored as both a cost-saving and security measure during the 1970s. And although the changeover to electric was rejected at the time, the light output of the lamps was increased to provide more adequate lighting. There have been claims that South Orange has more operating gaslights than any other community in the United States. In 2010, the village initiated a project that would automatically shut the lamps in the morning and light them at dusk, as part of an effort to save as much as $400,000 each year in energy costs for the 1,438 gas lamps across the village. As of 2019, these devices have not been installed.

Architecture is extremely varied. Most of the town is single-family wood-framed houses, however, there are a few apartment buildings from various eras as well as townhouse-style condominiums of mostly more recent vintage. Houses cover a range that includes every common style of the Mid-Atlantic United States since the late nineteenth century, and in sizes that range from brick English Cottages to giant Mansard-roofed mansions. Tudor, Victorian, Colonial, Ranch, Modern, and many others are all to be found. Most municipal government structures date from the 1920s, with a few being of more modern construction.

Many residents commute to New York City, but others work locally or in other parts of New Jersey. South Orange has a central business district with restaurants, banks, and other retail and professional services. There are a few small office buildings, but no large-scale enterprise other than Seton Hall University.

South Orange is bordered by the Essex County municipalities of Maplewood, Newark, West Orange, Orange, and East Orange. South Orange also comes close to bordering both Livingston and Millburn.

The East Branch of the Rahway River, which originates in West Orange, flows through the entire length of the village. Most of the time it is a trickle but flows can be heavy after rain. In the past it would occasionally overflow its banks and flood low-lying parts of town an issue that was addressed by United States Army Corps of Engineers flood control projects that remediated the problem in the mid-1970s.

The western part of the town sits on the eastern slope of South Mountain (elevation &lt;), leveling into a small valley near the central business district. At the top of the slope, the western edge of the town runs along the eastern border of South Mountain Reservation. South Orange contains the historic Montrose district, Newstead, Tuxedo Park, and Wyoming sections. Seton Hall University is located in the southeast quadrant of the township.

==Community information==
* The town was the first in the nation to have an affinity credit card, the idea of the municipal affinity credit card being originated by former village president William Calabrese.
* When the town was wired for telephones and electricity in the early 20th century, the poles and wires were not allowed to run along the curb lines of streets as they do in most towns. In some sections they run along property lines in the middle of blocks, and in others they run underground. This is aesthetically pleasing but complicates access to the lines, and it delayed the introduction of cable television. Occasional proposals to replace gas lights with electric lights run across the obstacle that there is no source of electric power along the streets.
* The current 761, 762, and 763 telephone exchanges used for most lines in South Orange and Maplewood, originated as the exchange names South Orange 1,2, and 3.
* Until April 25, 2024, South Orange&#x27;s full official name was the &quot;Township of South Orange Village.&quot; This name was originally adopted in lieu of the Village of South Orange because it allowed South Orange to receive more federal aid that was directed to Townships during the 1970s as many federal authorities were unfamiliar with the New Jersey municipal system, in which a township is not formally different from any other municipal designation. Other municipalities in New Jersey also adopted similar strategies, notably the Township of the Borough of Verona.
* South Orange was the first municipality in New Jersey to recognize civil unions for homosexual couples. Exactly one hour after unions became legal in South Orange, they were recognized in neighboring Maplewood.

<text>Verona is a township in Essex County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 14,572, an increase of 1,240 (+9.3%) from the 2010 census count of 13,332, which in turn reflected a decline of 201 (−1.5%) from the 13,533 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Verona and several neighboring towns were all originally one consolidated area known as the Horseneck Tract.

===18th century===
In 1702, a group of settlers left Newark and purchased a large tract of land northwest of their home city for the equivalent of a few hundred dollars from the Lenape Native Americans. This piece of land extended west and north to the Passaic River, south to the town center of what would become Livingston, and east to the First Watchung Mountain, and was called Horseneck by the natives because it resembled the neck and head of a horse. What was then known as Horseneck contained most of the present day northern Essex County towns: Verona, along with Caldwell, West Caldwell, Cedar Grove, Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell, and Roseland are all located entirely in Horseneck, and parts of what are today Livingston, Montclair, and West Orange also were contained in the Horseneck Tract.

After the Revolutionary War, the area of Horseneck was incorporated as &quot;Caldwell Township&quot; in honor of local war hero James Caldwell, a pastor who used pages from his church&#x27;s bibles as wadding to ignite the ammo in soldiers&#x27; cannons and helped to drive the British out of Horseneck.

===19th century===
In the 19th century, the area of present-day Verona was part of what was known as Vernon Valley. The name was rejected when residents applied to the United States Postal Service, as the name had already been in use for an area in Sussex County. Verona was chosen as the alternative name for the community. The township&#x27;s name is derived from Verona, Italy.

At various times between 1798 and 1892, issues arose which caused conflict between the Caldwell and Verona areas. These included a desire of the citizens of Verona to more closely control their own governmental affairs. With the population growing, Verona residents wanted to centrally locate essential services such as schools and places of worship, as well as problems with the water supply; and the disposition of road repair funds.

On February 17, 1892, the citizens of Verona voted to secede from Caldwell Township to form Verona Township.

===20th century===
Further growth and the need for a water system and other public utilities found Verona moving ahead of the other half of the township and in 1902 the two areas decided to separate into two separate municipalities: Verona Township and Verona Borough. It took two sessions of the state legislature to approve the new borough, but on April 18, 1907, the borough of Verona was approved by an act of the New Jersey Legislature, pending the results of a referendum held on April 30, 1907, in which the new borough passed by a 224–77 margin.

In 1907, residents of the newly formed borough had sought to disassociate themselves from the Overbrook County Insane Asylum and the Newark City Home, a reform school, and from the settlement of Cedar Grove, which was considered a settlement of farmers. On April 9, 1908, Verona Township changed its name to Cedar Grove Township.

In 1981, the borough was one of seven Essex County municipalities to pass a referendum to become a township, joining four municipalities that had already made the change, of what would ultimately be more than a dozen Essex County municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships in order take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis.

In 1976, Verona Borough received $213,000 in federal aid while similarly sized Cedar Grove Township received $1.24 million, suggesting financial benefits to structuring communities as townships as opposed to boroughs when possible. Today, Verona uses just &quot;Township of Verona&quot; in most official documents.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 2.82 square miles (7.29 km2), including 2.79 square miles (7.24 km2) of land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) of water (0.74%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Hillcrest and Verona Lake.

The township is bordered by Cedar Grove Township, Essex Fells, Montclair Township, North Caldwell and West Orange Township. Verona lies between two mountains, the First and Second Watchung Mountains with a small river, the Peckman, flowing at the bottom of the valley towards the Passaic River at Little Falls.

===Climate===
Verona has a humid continental climate (Dfa), with warm/hot humid summers and moderately cold winters. The climate is slightly cooler overall than in New York City, especially at night, because there is no urban heat island effect, as well as higher elevation and a more interior location (greater distance away from the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean).

January tends to be the coldest month, with average high temperatures in the upper 30s (Fahrenheit) and lows in the lower 20s. July is the warmest months with high temperatures in the mid 80s and lows in the mid 60s. From April to June and from September to early November, Verona enjoys temperatures from the lower 60s to upper 70s. Rainfall is plentiful, with around a year. Snowfall is common from December to March and nor&#x27;easters can bring significant amounts of snow. In January 1996, a weather station in nearby Newark, New Jersey, recorded over of snow from the North American blizzard of 1996.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 13,332 people, 5,315 households, and 3,524 families in the township. The population density was . There were 5,523 housing units at an average density of .

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.96% (795) of the population.

Of the 5,315 households, 30.5% had children under the age of 18; 56.1% were married couples living together; 7.6% had a female householder with no husband present and 33.7% were non-families.

<doc id="125187" wikidata="Q1082435" url="?curid=125187" title="West Caldwell, New Jersey">
<text>West Caldwell is a township located in the West Essex area in northwestern Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located approximately west of Manhattan and northwest of Newark. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 11,012, an increase of 253 (+2.4%) from the 2010 census count of 10,759, which in turn reflected a decline of 474 (−4.2%) from the 11,233 counted in the 2000 census.

West Caldwell was originally incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 24, 1904, from portions of Caldwell Township (now known as Fairfield Township). In 1981, the borough was one of seven Essex County municipalities to pass a referendum to become a township, joining four municipalities that had already made the change, of what would ultimately be more than a dozen Essex County municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships in order take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis. The borough was named for Caldwell Township, which in turn was named for Presbyterian minister James Caldwell.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked West Caldwell as its 60th best place to live in its 2010 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

==History==
Caldwell, West Caldwell, and several neighboring communities were all originally one combined area known as the Horseneck Tract. In the early 18th century, a group of settlers left Newark and purchased a large tract of land northwest of their home city for the equivalent of a few hundred dollars from the Lenape Native Americans. This piece of land extended west and north to the Passaic River, south to the town center of what would become Livingston, and east to the First Watchung Mountain, and was called Horseneck by the natives because it resembled the neck and head of a horse.

What was then known as Horseneck contained most of the present day northern Essex County towns: West Caldwell, along with Caldwell, Cedar Grove, Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell, Roseland, and Verona are all located entirely in Horseneck, and parts of what are today Livingston, Montclair, and West Orange also were contained in the Horseneck tract. After the Revolutionary War, Horseneck changed its name to &quot;Caldwell Township&quot; in honor of a local war hero and pastor, James Caldwell, who used burning pages from his church&#x27;s bibles to ignite the ammunition in soldiers&#x27; cannons and helped to drive the British out of Horseneck.

By the late 1880s, Caldwell had become quite a developed and populated town, however the vast majority of the development, residents, and businesses were located in the center of the town along Bloomfield Avenue, its main connecting route with Newark and New York City. The outskirts of town remained farms and swampland in many places. This bothered the people living in the center of town and in 1892, Caldwell&#x27;s center area decided to form its own independent municipality, naming itself Caldwell Borough and leaving the outskirts of town remaining as Caldwell Township.

Caldwell Borough contained what is today the towns of West Caldwell and Caldwell. Soon after, the area of Caldwell Township just to the east of Caldwell Borough between Caldwell Borough and Montclair (present-day Verona and Cedar Grove) decided to follow Caldwell&#x27;s lead and incorporated itself as its own borough, Verona. Some of the already-developed eastern neighborhoods of Caldwell Township chose to become part of Montclair, as it was a rapidly developing suburb of Newark and Paterson. At around the same time, the area north of Caldwell Borough became its own town, North Caldwell. The ritzy, wooded area directly to the south of downtown Caldwell Borough became Essex Fells. Meanwhile, the farmland to the south of the western portion of Caldwell township attempted to become its own municipality known as South Caldwell. This failed, as much of developed sections of that area lied on its southernmost and easternmost borders, along the expanding Newark suburbs of Livingston and West Orange respectively. Those areas were engulfed by those two towns once they became incorporated municipalities of several small settlements and developments. This left only the most rural farmland south of Caldwell Borough and Essex Fells to become its own township, Roseland. At this point, all that remained of the original Caldwell Township was a large piece of undeveloped land in the northwesternmost part of Essex County; eventually, in the early 1950s, Caldwell Township changed its name to Fairfield in order to avoid being confused with Caldwell Borough.

Immediately following the separation of the original Caldwell, the western part of Caldwell Borough generally remained less developed than downtown Caldwell Borough and contained several farms and a large area of undeveloped swampland known as Hatfield Swamp. However, two individual settlements, known as Franklin and Westville, soon formed in the western part of Caldwell Borough. As development increased and population grew in the western part of Caldwell, the town&#x27;s more rural western population and more urban east often could not reconcile their differences. This led to the areas of Franklin and Westville consolidating into their own borough known as West Caldwell in 1904, leaving only the one square mile of original downtown Horseneck development as the borough of Caldwell. The first mayor of West Caldwell was Caleb Crane, a member of the successful Crane family related to Israel Crane of Montclair (then called Cranetown). Caldwell Borough became Caldwell Township in the 1980s. To this day, the towns of Caldwell and West Caldwell remain by far the most urbanized, densely populated, and ethnically, racially, and income-diverse in the West Essex area. The town is home to Grover Cleveland Park (also partially located in Caldwell and Essex Fells), a county park named in honor of the President of the United States who was born in the neighboring town of Caldwell.

Additionally, West Caldwell contains a number of smaller parks and land preserves, such as Memorial Park and Francisco Park. Hatfield Swamp, located in the western section of the town along its borders with the towns of Fairfield, Roseland, and East Hanover, is a protected preservation that usually very little building is allowed to be done on.

Though today the Caldwell area is considered to be a suburb of both Newark and New York, the area originally developed as its own individual, self-contained town and economy rather than as urban sprawl from a larger city. When it was formed, a few miles of woods separated downtown Caldwell from Newark or any of its developing suburbs. Bloomfield Avenue is located in the center of town, and is home to many of the locally owned stores of the town. West Caldwell has several stores and strip malls, and two public town pools, Cedar Street Pool and Westville Pool. The township has few violent crimes and only two murders in its history.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 5.11 square miles (13.24 km2), including 5.10 square miles (13.20 km2) of land and 0.02 square miles (0.04 km2) of water (0.31%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Ferncliff, Franklin, Pine Brook Bridge and Westville.

West Caldwell borders the municipalities of Caldwell, Essex Fells, Fairfield Township, North Caldwell and Roseland in Essex County; and East Hanover in Morris County.

The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Clayton is a weak mayor/strong council government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie.

The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

In March 2019, the borough council selected Christina Moorhouse from three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat vacated by Vonzora Jackson&#x27;s resignation.

<doc id="125195" wikidata="Q155203" url="?curid=125195" title="Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh">
<text>Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh (born Sophie Helen Rhys-Jones; 20 January 1965) is a member of the British royal family. She is married to Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, the youngest sibling of King Charles III.

Sophie grew up in Brenchley, Kent, and later attended West Kent College, training as a secretary. She then worked in public relations, representing firms across the UK, Switzerland and Australia before opening her own agency in 1996. She met Edward in 1987 while working for Capital Radio; they began dating in 1993. Their engagement was announced in January 1999, and they married on 19 June at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The couple have two children: Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James Mountbatten-Windsor, Earl of Wessex, who are respectively sixteenth and fifteenth in line to the British throne .

In 2002, Sophie closed her business interests and began full-time work as a member of the royal family. She is the patron of over 70 charities and organisations, including Childline and the London College of Fashion. She undertakes over 200 engagements each year, including visits to schools, universities and military bases. Her charity work primarily revolves around people with disabilities, women&#x27;s rights, avoidable blindness and agriculture.

==Early life and career==
Sophie Helen Rhys-Jones was born at Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 20 January 1965 into a middle-class family. Her father, Christopher Bournes Rhys-Jones (born 1931), is a retired sales director for an importer of industrial tyres and rubber goods. Her mother was Mary (née O&#x27;Sullivan; 1934–2005), a charity worker and secretary. She has an elder brother, David (born 1963), and was named after her father&#x27;s sister, Helen, who died in a riding accident in 1960. Her godfather, actor Thane Bettany, was her father&#x27;s stepbrother; both men spent their early life in Sarawak, North Borneo, then a British Protectorate ruled by the White Rajahs. 

She descends from King Henry IV of England and is related to the family of the Viscounts Molesworth through her grandmother, Margaret Patricia Rhys-Jones (née Molesworth; 1904–1985), who was the great-granddaughter of the Rev. John Molesworth, himself the father of Sir Guilford Molesworth and a great-grandson of Robert Molesworth, 1st Viscount Molesworth.

Rhys-Jones was raised in a four-bedroom 17th-century farmhouse in Brenchley, Kent. She began her education at Dulwich Preparatory School, before moving on to Kent College, Pembury, where she was friends with Sarah Sienesi, with whom she subsequently shared a flat in Fulham and who later became her lady-in-waiting. Rhys-Jones then trained as a secretary at West Kent College, Tonbridge.

She began a career in public relations, working for a variety of firms, including four years at Capital Radio, where she was assigned to the press and promotions department, as well as public relations companies The Quentin Bell Organisation and MacLaurin Communications &amp; Media. She also worked as a ski representative in Switzerland and spent a year travelling and working in Australia. In 1996, Rhys-Jones launched her public relations agency, RJH Public Relations, which she ran with her business partner, Murray Harkin, for five years.

Prior to her marriage, Rhys-Jones lived at Coleherne Court, London.

==Marriage and children==
While working at Capital Radio, Rhys-Jones met Prince Edward, the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, for the first time in 1987 when he was dating her friend. She met him again at a promotion shoot for the Prince Edward Summer Challenge to raise money for charity in 1993, and the two began their relationship soon afterwards. In December 1993 and amid growing speculation about whether they were planning to marry, Edward wrote a letter to newspaper editors, in which he denied any wedding plans and asked the media to respect their privacy. Edward proposed to Rhys-Jones at a vacation in the Bahamas in December 1998 and their engagement was announced on 6 January 1999. Edward proposed to her with an engagement ring featuring a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-carat white gold. The ring was made by Asprey and Garrard (now Garrard &amp; Co) and is worth an estimated £105,000. Rhys-Jones, who was reportedly close to the Queen from the beginning of her relationship with Edward, was allowed to use the royal apartments at Buckingham Palace prior to her engagement.

The wedding took place on 19 June 1999 at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, a break from the weddings of Edward&#x27;s older siblings, which were large, formal events at Westminster Abbey or St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. On the day of their marriage, Prince Edward was created a hereditary peer as Earl of Wessex with the subsidiary title of Viscount Severn (derived from the Welsh roots of his wife&#x27;s family).

The couple spent their honeymoon at Balmoral Castle. Following their union, the Earl and Countess of Wessex moved to Bagshot Park, their home in Surrey. While their private residence is Bagshot Park, their office and official London residence is based at Buckingham Palace.

In December 2001, Sophie was taken to the King Edward VII Hospital after feeling unwell. It was discovered that she was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy and the foetus had to be removed. Two years later, on 8 November 2003, she prematurely gave birth to her daughter, Lady Louise, resulting from a sudden placental abruption that placed both mother and child at risk, and the Countess had to undergo an emergency caesarean section at Frimley Park Hospital, while the Earl of Wessex rushed back from Mauritius. Sophie returned to Frimley Park Hospital on 17 December 2007, to give birth, again by caesarean section, to her son, James (then Viscount Severn, now Earl of Wessex).

In May 2019, she took over the patronage of the Chartered Management Institute from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
In April 2020, the Countess helped Rhubarb, a catering company, in preparing and delivering food to NHS staff amidst the coronavirus pandemic, an initiative organised by Ian Wace. Sophie has also volunteered at local food banks, including the Hope Hub and the Lighthouse, in Surrey and delivered parcels to the homeless during the pandemic. In September 2020, Sophie, alongside her husband and children, participated in the Great British Beach Clean at Southsea Beach in support of the Marine Conservation Society.

In February 2021, as grand president of St John Ambulance, the Countess started working as a care volunteer at an NHS vaccination centre. In May 2021, Sophie become royal patron of Wellbeing of Women, a charity focused on all areas of women&#x27;s reproductive health across a woman&#x27;s life course, from menstrual health to menopause. A patron of this charity, she later discussed her own struggles with menopause and how it affected her memory. In July 2021, Princess Alexandra handed over the patronage of The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association to Sophie. In December 2022, Sophie was honoured at the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, where she received the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for her work concerning sexual violence in war zones. In February 2025, she became patron of the Mothers&#x27; Union, following in the footsteps of Queen Victoria, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and Queen Elizabeth II.

==Public image and style==
At the start of her relationship with Prince Edward, Sophie was referred to as &quot;the girl next door&quot;, and noted for her successful career and ordinary background. In the early years of her marriage, Sophie faced public scrutiny for her business interests, and was often compared to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, who had died two years earlier. On her transition to becoming a full-time royal, she later stated: &quot;Certainly it took me a while to find my feet. The frustration was I had to reduce my expectations of what I could actually do. I couldn&#x27;t turn up at a charity and go, right, I think you should be doing this, because that&#x27;s what I was used to doing in my working life. I had to take a really big step back and go, OK, they want you to be the icing on the cake, the person to come in to thank their volunteers and funders, not necessarily to tell them how to run their communications plan.&quot;

Sophie has since been cited as an under-the-radar &quot;stabilizing influence&quot; and a &quot;safe pair of hands&quot;. She has been said to have a low-key approach to royal engagements, and often drives herself to and from events. Amanda Pullinger stated to &quot;Town and Country&quot;, &quot;She actually presents herself as an ordinary person and I think that is increasingly what the royal family needs to do.&quot; She has also been noted for her long-term work on &quot;gritty&quot; subject matters such as gender-based violence in conflict, and trips to &quot;difficult areas&quot;, such as South Sudan and Sierra Leone. The Countess&#x27;s engagements gained significant attention from the public post-Megxit, with her charity work and style choices receiving increased commentary and analysis. Writer Ingrid Seward states that Sophie &quot;is not a self-publicist...She looks good, without being over-the-top, and she&#x27;s not craving celebrity. You often wouldn&#x27;t know she had carried out all those engagements.&quot;

Sophie was not initially prominent for her fashion, but eventually began to develop her own style and has worn outfits by many notable designers. She has exclusively worn Jane Taylor millinery designs since 2009 on numerous occasions. In a &quot;Marie Claire&quot; interview, Taylor described her first royal commission: &quot;My first royal client was the Countess of Wessex, and it was quite nerve-racking. But she wears such lovely clothes and she always looks so fabulous, so it&#x27;s quite easy to design for her. Since she came to see me, she&#x27;s never worn any other milliner&#x27;s hats, which is a big compliment. I was really excited, honored, and slightly nervous.&quot; Alongside the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Sussex, Sophie has been named one of the most stylish members of the royal family. Sophie is particularly known for wearing different combinations of hats and coats, and favours silk dresses and frocks. Describing her style in an interview by &quot;Sunday Express&quot; Sophie said: &quot;It&#x27;s about my charities, but I recognize that I&#x27;m on display. [...] When you walk into a room, yes, people are going to talk about what you&#x27;re doing there, but they&#x27;re also going to want to know what you&#x27;re wearing&quot;. She also revealed that she has never had a stylist of her own and that she makes her fashion choices herself. In 2015, the Countess was named on &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s Best Dressed List. Together with the then-Duchess of Cambridge, Sophie hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during the 2018 London Fashion Week.

==Privacy and the media==

===Violation of privacy===
In May 1999, less than a month before her wedding, &quot;The Sun&quot; published a photo of a topless Sophie with her Capital Radio colleague Chris Tarrant, which was taken during a business trip to Spain in 1988. Buckingham Palace immediately issued a statement saying, &quot;This morning&#x27;s story in &quot;The Sun&quot; is a gross invasion of privacy and cannot be regarded as in the public interest. It has caused considerable distress.&quot; Prime Minister Tony Blair also condemned the publication of the photograph. The Palace made an official complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). According to Sophie&#x27;s business partner the incident had left her &quot;distressed&quot;, and she was reportedly &quot;devastated&quot; and felt &quot;she was &#x27;letting the side down&#x27; before her wedding&quot;. Tarrant later said, &quot;There was never, ever the slightest hint of romance between Sophie and myself, let alone these snidey insinuations.&quot; Following its publication, the newspaper issued a statement and apologised to Rhys-Jones and the next issue came out with the headline &quot;Sorry, Sophie&quot;. It also said that it would again apologise to Sophie in a letter and donate all sale proceeds of the issue to her charities. The photo was sold to the tabloid by Kara Noble, a former friend and colleague of Sophie. Noble later apologised in the following months saying, &quot;I just want to say sorry to everyone who was involved.&quot; Both she and the newspaper faced criticism from the public, and Noble was fired from her job at Heart 106.2 FM. The couple later decided not to make a formal complaint.

In 2011, close associates of Jonathan Rees, a private investigator connected to the &quot;News International&quot; phone hacking scandal, stated that he had penetrated Sophie and Edward&#x27;s bank accounts and sold details about them to the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

===Media sting===
In April 2001, Sophie appeared in the media after she was misled in a meeting at the Dorchester by a &quot;News of the World&quot; reporter posing as an Arab sheikh, Mazher Mahmood, who was later exposed for perjury in Southwark Crown Court. It was claimed by the newspapers that during their &quot;secretly taped&quot; conversation, the Countess had insulted the royal family and politicians, calling the Queen &quot;old dear&quot; and criticising the leadership of prime ministers John Major and Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. She also reportedly commented on Prince Charles&#x27;s relationship with his then-partner Camilla, arguing that a marriage would not be possible as long as the Queen Mother was alive. However, despite some initial reports, the paper acquitted her of referring to Cherie Blair as &quot;absolutely horrid&quot; and mocking Leader of the Opposition William Hague&#x27;s appearance. Murray Harkin, Sophie&#x27;s business partner who was also present at the meeting, was recorded discussing his sex life and cocaine use and boasting about Sophie&#x27;s abilities in securing celebrities for various events. Tabloid newspapers claimed the Countess had sent apology letters to Blair, Hague and Prince Charles.

Buckingham Palace denied the accuracy of the reports, saying: &quot;The Countess of Wessex, who is trying to pursue her own career, is obviously vulnerable to set-ups such as this.&quot; The Palace released a statement saying the reported comments were &quot;selective, distorted and in several cases, flatly untrue&quot;. The Palace officials stated that Sophie had not insulted the Queen, the Queen Mother, or the politicians, while according to the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; four reliable sources had confirmed these reports. The &quot;News of the World&quot; attributed the negative reactions to the jealousy of the rival media, as the outlet had previously conducted an interview with Sophie in which she addressed the rumours about her difficulties in marriage and discussed her husband&#x27;s sexuality. Sophie had reportedly agreed to the intimate interview on the condition that the newspaper would not publish transcript of the tapes. In a separate statement Sophie said she was &quot;distressed by the carrying out of an entrapment operation&quot; on her, but also regretted her &quot;own misjudgment in succumbing to that subterfuge&quot;. Subsequently, in 2002, both the Earl and Countess announced that they would quit their business interests in order to focus on activities and official engagements on behalf of the royal family and aid the Queen in her Golden Jubilee year.

===Jewellery gifts===
The Countess of Wessex was criticised for accepting two sets of jewels from the royal family of Bahrain during an official day-long visit to the country in December 2011, as she and her husband returned to the UK from a trip to Afghanistan. She was given one set by Bahrain&#x27;s king and a second set by the country&#x27;s prime minister, Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa. Her husband, the Earl, received a pen and a watch as well as a silk rug from the Crown Prince of Bahrain, Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who also gave Sophie a silver and pearl cup. The value of the jewellery has not been estimated and its precise contents were not disclosed. Given concern about human rights abuses in Bahrain, this gift attracted controversy, with calls for the jewels to be sold, and the proceeds used for the benefit of the Bahraini people.

Critics said the Countess should sell the gems and give the proceeds to political protesters in Bahrain. Denis MacShane, then a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) and previously a Foreign Office minister, said: &quot;Given the appalling suffering and repression of the Bahraini people, it would be a fitting gesture for the Countess of Wessex to auction these trinkets and distribute the proceeds to the victims of the regime.&quot;

Royal family guidelines and procedures relating to gifts, published by the government in 2003, state that &quot;before accepting any gift, careful consideration should always be given, wherever practicable, to the donor, the reason for and occasion of the gift and the nature of the gift itself ... Equally, before declining the offer of a gift, careful consideration should be given to any offence that might be caused by such action.&quot;

== Education ==
The Elk Township School District serves students in public school for pre-kindergarten through sixth grade at Aura School. As of the 2022–23 school year, the district, comprised of one school, had an enrollment of 336 students and 32.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.3:1. Aura School was built in 1927 and rededicated in 1949 after a fire the previous year, with the newest addition built in 2002.

For seventh through twelfth grades, public school students attend the Delsea Regional School District, which serves students from both Elk Township and Franklin Township. Students from Newfield attend the district&#x27;s schools as part of a sending/receiving relationship begun in September 2010 after Newfield ended its prior relationship with the Buena Regional School District. Schools in the district (with 2022–23 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Delsea Regional Middle School with 518 students in grades 7-8 and 
Delsea Regional High School with 1,074 students in grades 9-12. The seats on the high school district&#x27;s nine-member board of education are allocated to the constituent municipalities based on population, with two seats assigned to Elk Township.

The New Jersey Department of Education considered a vote by the Board of Education of the Franklin Township Public Schools in June 2010, requesting that the district withdraw from the Delsea Regional School District, which would require that the Delsea region be dissolved since about 80% of the regional district&#x27;s students come from Franklin. With the withdrawal of Franklin Township, two options considered were to either have Franklin and Elk Townships create a new regional district with Newfield students attending on a send-receive basis, or having Franklin Township establish its own Pre-K–12 district which would receive students from both Elk Township and Newfield.

Students from across the county are eligible to apply to attend Gloucester County Institute of Technology, a four-year high school in Deptford Township that provides technical and vocational education. As a public school, students do not pay tuition to attend the school.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===
Franklin Township is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor.

, the Franklin Township Committee is comprised of Mayor John &quot;Jake&quot; Bruno (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2027; term as mayor ends 2025), Deputy Mayor Tim Doyle (R, term on committee ends 2026; term as deputy mayor ends 2025), Mark Fiorella (R, 2026), Jonathan Keen (R, 2025) and Mike Marsh (R, 2025).

In January 2020, Timothy Doyle was chosen from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that had been held by Leah Vasallo until she resigned from office the previous month.

Republican Heather Flaim was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2018 that became vacant following the death of Ed Leopardi in September 2016; a judge ruled in May 2017 that Flaim could take the seat in a ruling in a case in which the local Democratic municipal committee claimed that it had submitted a list of three candidates to succeed Leopardi, which the township claims it never received. Flaim won a full three-year term in the November 2017 general election, while Democrat Charles F. Pluta was elected to serve the balance of Leopardi&#x27;s term of office.

As of the 2022–23 school year, the district, comprised of three schools, had an enrollment of 1,338 students and 116.2 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.5:1. Schools in the district (with 2022–23 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Mary F. Janvier Elementary School with 555 students in grades K-2, 
Main Road School with 392 students in grades 3-4 and 
Caroline L. Reutter School with 379 students in grades 5-6. Students from Newfield attend the Franklin Township district&#x27;s schools as part of a sending/receiving relationship in which Newfield accounts for about 100 of the nearly 1,400 students in the district.

For seventh through twelfth grades, students attend the Delsea Regional School District, which serves students from both Elk Township and Franklin Township. Students from Newfield attend the district&#x27;s schools as part of a sending/receiving relationship begun in September 2010 after Newfield ended its prior relationship with the Buena Regional School District. Schools in the district (with 2022–23 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Delsea Regional Middle School with 518 students in grades 7-8 and 
Delsea Regional High School with 1,074 students in grades 9-12. The seats on the high school district&#x27;s nine-member board of education are allocated to the constituent municipalities based on population, with seven seats assigned to Franklin Township.

The New Jersey Department of Education considered a vote by the Franklin Township Board of Education in June 2010 requesting that the district withdraw from the Delsea Regional School District, which would require that the Delsea region be dissolved as about 80% of the regional district&#x27;s students come from Franklin. With the withdrawal of Franklin Township, two options being considered were to either have Franklin and Elk Townships create a new regional district with Newfield students attending on a send-receive basis, or having Franklin Township establish its own Pre-K–12 district which would receive students from both Elk Township and Newfield.

Students from across the county are eligible to apply to attend Gloucester County Institute of Technology, a four-year high school in Deptford Township that provides technical and vocational education. As a public school, students do not pay tuition to attend the school.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Camden operates St. Michael the Archangel Regional School in Clayton; Nativity Church in Franklinville is one of the sending parishes.

<doc id="125200" wikidata="Q1083910" url="?curid=125200" title="Glassboro, New Jersey">
<text>Glassboro is a borough within Gloucester County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, within the Philadelphia metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 23,149, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 4,570 (+24.6%) from the 18,579 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn had reflected a decline of 489 (−2.6%) from the 19,068 counted in the 2000 census. Much of the recent and projected growth in Glassboro have been attributed to the growth trajectory of Rowan University, founded in 1923 and formerly known as Glassboro State College. Glassboro and surrounding Gloucester County constitute part of South Jersey.

What is now Glassboro was originally formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 11, 1878, from portions of Clayton Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Elk Township (April 17, 1891) and Pitman (May 24, 1905). Glassboro was incorporated as a borough on March 18, 1920, replacing Glassboro Township. The borough was named for its glass industry.

==History==

Glassboro&#x27;s early industrial history was built on the manufacturing of glass. The town was first established in 1779 by Solomon Stanger as Glass Works in the Woods. Glass manufacturers over the years since include Heston-Carpenter Glass Works, Olive Glass Works, Harmony Glass Works, Temperanceville Glass Works, Whitney Brothers Glass Works, Owens Bottle Company, Owens Illinois Glass Company, and Anchor Hocking.

Rowan University, formerly Glassboro State College, was founded in 1923. The university was the site of the Glassboro Summit Conference in 1967 between U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin.
In 1958, a typhoid fever epidemic broke out in the predominantly African-American neighborhoods of Elsmere and Lawns, which was attributed to 20 years of municipal neglect of the sanitary infrastructure in these neighborhoods.

The Glassboro Summit Conference between U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin took place in Glassboro. Johnson and Kosygin met for three days from June 23 to June 25, 1967, at Glassboro State College (later renamed Rowan University). The location was chosen as a compromise. Kosygin, having agreed to address the United Nations in New York City, wanted to meet in New York City. Johnson, wary of encountering protests against the Vietnam War, preferred to meet in Washington, D.C. They agreed in Glassboro because it was equidistant between the two cities. The summit&#x27;s generally amicable atmosphere was referred to as the &quot;Spirit of Glassboro,&quot; although the leaders failed to reach agreement on limiting anti-ballistic missile systems.

On June 19, 1986, Ronald Reagan became the first sitting president to speak at a high school graduation when he spoke at the Glassboro High School commencement ceremonies.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 9.36 square miles (24.24 km2), including 9.32 square miles (24.14 km2) of land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) of water (0.41%). Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Elsemere.

Glassboro borders the Gloucester County municipalities of Clayton Borough, Elk Township, Harrison Township, Mantua Township, Monroe Township, Pitman, and Washington Township.

===Climate===

<text>The Battle of Dettingen () took place on 27 June 1743 during the War of the Austrian Succession at Dettingen in the Electorate of Mainz, Holy Roman Empire (now Karlstein am Main in Bavaria). It was fought between a Pragmatic Army, composed of the British, Hanoverian and Austrian troops, and a French army commanded by the duc de Noailles.

While the Earl of Stair exercised operational control, the Allied army was nominally commanded by King George II, accompanied by his son the Duke of Cumberland. As a result, it is now best remembered as the last time a reigning British monarch led troops in combat. Despite being an Allied victory, the battle had little effect on the wider war, and has been described as &#x27;a happy escape, rather than a great victory.&#x27;

==Background==
The immediate cause of the War of the Austrian Succession was the death in 1740 of Emperor Charles VI, last in the direct line of male Habsburgs, leaving his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as heir to the Habsburg monarchy. Prior to 1713, the Monarchy was subject to Salic law, whereby women were barred from the succession. The Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 allowed Maria Theresa to inherit the throne, but the ruling was challenged by Charles Albert of Bavaria, the closest male heir.

An internal dynastic dispute became a European issue since the Monarchy formed the most powerful single element in the Holy Roman Empire. A federation of mostly German states, it was headed by the Holy Roman emperor, in theory an elected position but held by the Habsburgs since 1440. In January 1742, Charles of Bavaria became the first non-Habsburg emperor in 300 years, with the support of France, Prussia and Saxony. Maria Theresa was backed by the so-called Pragmatic Allies, which in addition to Austria included Britain, Hanover and the Dutch Republic.

In December 1740, Prussia invaded the Austrian province of Silesia, whose mining, weaving and dyeing industries provided 10% of total Imperial income. France, Saxony and Bavaria occupied Habsburg territories in Bohemia, while Spain joined the war, hoping to regain possessions in Northern Italy lost to Austria in 1713. By early 1742, Austria&#x27;s position seemed desperate; Britain agreed to send a naval squadron to the Mediterranean and 17,000 troops to the Austrian Netherlands, under the Earl of Stair.

However, Austria made peace with Prussia in the June 1742 Treaty of Breslau; by December, they occupied most of Bavaria while the French armies were devastated by disease. The focus of the 1743 campaign switched to Germany; the Austrians defeated the Bavarians at Simbach and in mid-June, the Allied army arrived at Aschaffenburg, on the north bank of the River Main. Here they were joined by George II, who was attending the coronation of a new Elector of Mainz. By late June, the Allies were running short of supplies and began their withdrawal towards the nearest supply depot at Hanau. The road ran through Dettingen, where the French commander Noailles, positioned 23,000 troops under his nephew Gramont.

==Battle==
Around 1:00 am on 27 June, the Allies left Aschaffenburg in three columns, and marched along the north bank of the Main, heading for Hanau. The French position at Dettingen was extremely strong; De Gramont&#x27;s infantry held a line anchored on the village, and running to the Spessart Heights, with the cavalry on level ground to their left. Noailles instructed de Vallière to place his guns on the south bank of the Main, which allowed them to fire into the left flank of the Pragmatic army.

Inadequate reconnaissance was a problem for the Allies throughout the war, and the French presence in Dettingen took them by surprise. Their danger became clear when Noailles sent another 12,000 troops over the River Main at Aschaffenburg, into the Allied rear; he had high hopes of destroying their entire army. Ilton, commander of the Allied infantry, ordered the British and Hanoverian Foot Guards back to Aschaffenburg, while the remainder changed from column of march into four lines to attack the French position. As they did so, they were fired on by the French artillery, although this caused relatively few casualties.

Despite being ordered three times by Noailles to hold their position, around midday the elite Maison du Roi cavalry charged the Allied lines. Who initiated it is disputed, de Gramont being the most common choice; French historian De Périni suggests the Maison de Roi, who had not seen action since Malplaquet in 1709, saw an opportunity to win the battle on their own and led by the duc d&#x27;Harcourt, they broke through the first three lines, throwing the inexperienced British cavalry into confusion. 

They were followed by the Gardes Françaises infantry, in a disjointed and piecemeal attack which forced de Vallière to cease fire for fear of hitting his own troops, allowing the British infantry in the fourth line to hold their ground. A Hanoverian artillery battery began firing at close range into the French infantry, while an Austrian brigade took them in the flank. After three hours of fighting, the French retreated to the left bank of the Main, most of their casualties occurring when one of the bridges collapsed. The Pragmatic Army continued towards Hanau; although it has been suggested that they could have exploited their victory, they were in no shape to attempt a contested river crossing. Their precarious position was demonstrated by the need to abandon their wounded in order to move faster.

==Aftermath==
Although George II handed out numerous promotions and rewards to his subordinates, Dettingen is generally viewed as a lucky escape. Forced to withdraw due to lack of supplies, the Allied army escaped but had to abandon their wounded, and might have suffered a serious defeat if Noailles&#x27; orders had been followed.
On 30 September the 14,000-strong Dutch corps of the Pragmatic Army under the command of Count Nassau-Ouwekerk reached the Allied camp. However, as the threat to the Electorate of Hanover had subsided due to the French withdrawal, George decided to take no further action, even though Stair had urged the king to pursue the French army. They then took up winter quarters in the Netherlands.

It was the last battle for several senior officers; in 1744, Noailles was appointed Foreign Minister, while de Gramont was killed at Fontenoy in 1745. The 70 year old Stair retired, and was replaced by the equally elderly George Wade. The Allied cavalry performed woefully, failing to locate 23,000 men across their line of retreat, less than away, while many troopers were allegedly unable to control their horses. Only the infantry&#x27;s training and discipline saved the army from destruction, and one of the training companies at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst is named &#x27;Dettingen&#x27; in recognition of this fact.

In honour of the battle, and his patron George II, Handel composed the &quot;Dettingen Te Deum&quot; and &quot;Dettingen Anthem.&quot;

<text>Barnard Castle (, ) is a market town on the north bank of the River Tees, in County Durham, England. The town is named after and built around a medieval castle ruin. The town&#x27;s Bowes Museum has an 18th-century Silver Swan automaton exhibit and paintings by Goya and El Greco.

It sits on the opposite bank to Startforth and is south-west of the county town of Durham. Nearby towns include Bishop Auckland to the north-east, Darlington to the east and Richmond in North Yorkshire to the south-east. The largest employer is GlaxoSmithKline, with a manufacturing facility on the town&#x27;s outskirts.

==History==
Before the Norman Conquest in 1066, the upper half of Teesdale had been combined into an Anglo-Norse estate which was centred upon the ancient village of Gainford and mortgaged to the Earls of Northumberland. The first Norman Bishop of Durham, Bishop Walcher, was murdered in 1080. This led to the surrounding country being attacked and laid waste by the Norman overlords. Further rebellion in 1095 caused the king William II to break up the Earldom of Northumberland into smaller baronies. The Lordship of Gainford was given to Guy de Balliol.

The earthwork fortifications of the castle were rebuilt in stone by his successor, Bernard de Balliol I during the latter half of the 12th century, giving rise to the town&#x27;s name. The castle passed down through the Balliol family (of which the Scottish king, John Balliol, was the most important member) and then into the possession of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. King Richard III inherited it through his wife, Anne Neville, but it fell into ruins in the century after his death.

The remains of the castle are Grade I listed, whilst the chapel in the outer ward is Grade II listed. Both sets of remains are now in the care of English Heritage and open to the public.

John Bowes lived at nearby Streatlam Castle (demolished in 1959). His Streatlam stud never had more than ten breeding mares at one time, but produced no fewer than four Derby winners in twenty years. The last of these, &quot;West Australian&quot;, was the first racehorse to win the Triple Crown, in 1853.

Bowes and his wife Joséphine Benoîte Coffin-Chevallier founded the Bowes Museum, which is of national status. Housed in its own ornate building, the museum contains an El Greco, paintings by Goya, Canaletto, Boucher, Fragonard and a collection of decorative art. A great attraction is the 18th century silver swan automaton, which periodically preens itself, looks round and appears to catch and swallow a fish.

Although never a major manufacturing centre, in the 18th century industry centred on hand loom wool weaving, and in the early 19th century the principal industry was spinning and the manufacture of shoe thread.

==Notable visitors ==
Walter Scott frequently visited his friend John Sawrey Morritt at Rokeby Hall and was fond of exploring Teesdale. He begins his epic poem &quot;Rokeby&quot; (1813) with a man standing on guard on the round tower of the Barnard Castle fortress.

Charles Dickens (Boz) and his illustrator Hablot Browne (Phiz) stayed at the King&#x27;s Head in Barnard Castle while researching his novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; in the winter of 1837–38. He is said to have entered William Humphrey&#x27;s clock-maker&#x27;s shop, then opposite the hotel, and enquired who had made a certain remarkable clock. William replied that his boy Humphrey had done it. This seems to have prompted Dickens to choose the title &quot;Master Humphrey&#x27;s Clock&quot; for his new weekly, in which &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; and &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; appeared.

William Wordsworth, Daniel Defoe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Hilaire Belloc, Bill Bryson and the artist J. M. W. Turner have also visited the town.

In May 2020 Barnard Castle came to national attention when Dominic Cummings, the chief adviser of the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, was discovered to have driven to the town with his family during the COVID-19 pandemic, while at a significant risk of having the disease himself owing to contact with the infected Prime Minister. (Cummings developed symptoms the next day.) Following media allegations that he had broken lockdown regulations by driving to the town, he told how he drove there to test his eyesight to reassure his wife that he was able to drive them back to London the next day.

==Governance==

Barnard Castle is for all purposes (historic, ceremonial and unitary authority) located in County Durham. Barnard Castle has a Town Council governing a civil parish. The Town Council elects a ceremonial Town Mayor annually.

It is part of the Bishop Auckland parliamentary constituency, which as of 2024 is represented in parliament by Sam Rushworth of the Labour Party. All four Durham County Councillors whose wards (Barnard Castle East and Barnard Castle West) include part of Barnard Castle are Conservative.

The local police force is Durham Constabulary. The town is the base for the Barnard Castle division, which covers . This division is within the force&#x27;s south area.
===Former===
Between 1894 and 1974 the town was administratively part of Barnard Castle Urban District. The administrative and ceremonial county boundary was adjusted in 1974. Barnard Castle became administrative centre of the Teesdale district of County Durham non-metropolitan county until its abolition on 1 April 2009 and the county council became the unitary authority of County Durham.

==Transport==

Barnard Castle has road connections to Bishop Auckland, Spennymoor and central County Durham via the A688 and Darlington, Stockton-on-Tees, and Middlesbrough by the A67. Barnard Castle is also from the A66, with access to the M6 to the west and the A1(M) to the east. The B6278 also connects Barnard Castle with Middleton-in-Teesdale. The old road bridge over the River Tees was built in 1569 and is Grade I listed.

Barnard Castle railway station was closed for passenger trains in 1964. A Bill was approved in 1854 for a line from a junction with the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway at Darlington to Barnard Castle and opened on 9 July 1856, with intermediate stations at Broomielaw, Winston, Gainford and Piercebridge. The terminus at Darlington only lasted five years. In 1856 the South Durham &amp; Lancashire Railway proposed a line from Bishop Auckland to Tebay via Barnard Castle and Kirkby Stephen but only the western section was built with the Company receiving its Bill in 1857.

The line opened on 8 August 1861 from a second terminus at Barnard Castle to a junction with the Lancaster &amp; Carlisle Railway at Tebay with intermediate stations at Lartington, Bowes, Barras, Kirkby Stephen, Ravenstondale &amp; Gaisgill. The two stations at Barnard Castle were some distance apart; the earliest station became a through station and closed to passengers on 1 May 1862, but remained in use as a goods depot. The second station was closed for passenger trains under the Beeching cuts in 1964 and completely on 5 April 1965 and the site was eventually built on by GlaxoSmithKline. Today rail access is via , or . There are two bus routes provided by Arriva North East which connect Barnard Castle to Darlington, the X75 (Via Staindrop) and X76 (Via Winston) and there is also the 79, provided by Hodgsons Coaches, which travels from Barnard Castle to Richmond.

==Education==

Barnard Castle School is an independent co-educational boarding school located on the eastern edge of the town. Teesdale School is an 11–18 comprehensive school on the outskirts of the town, just off the A688.

There are three primary schools serving the town. Green Lane school is a primary school for 4–11 year olds. St Mary&#x27;s is a Roman Catholic school situated on Birch Road near the church of the same name. Montalbo Primary School and Nursery is for 3-11year olds.

==Culture==
The Bowes Museum was purpose-built to house the collection of John and Josephine Bowes. The museum is built in the style of a French chateau, in extensive grounds, and is by far the largest building in the town. It contains paintings by El Greco, Francisco Goya, Canaletto, Jean-Honoré Fragonard and François Boucher, together with a sizable collection of decorative art, ceramics, textiles, tapestries, clocks and costumes, as well as older items from local history. It is famous for the Silver Swan automaton, which played every day at 2pm until it seized up during the 2020 COVID-19 Lockdown, it is currently undergoing repairs.

The Witham Arts Centre on the Horse Market, presents a variety of events, including drama, cinema, music, spoken word and children&#x27;s events as well as being the town&#x27;s visitor information centre.

The Barnard Castle Meet is an annual carnival festival held on the second bank holiday weekend in May, the schools&#x27; summer half-term week. The Meet, as it is known locally, has grown from the North East Cyclists&#x27; Meet dating back to 1885, and since the early 1900s the town has staged a carnival and grand procession through the town centre on the bank holiday Monday. The weekend is now probably the largest event in the Barnard Castle and Teesdale calendar. There are around twenty separate events that the Meet Committee asserts &#x27;reach every corner of the community&#x27;. In recent years the committee has staged its own music event showcasing local and national talent on the Sunday and Monday, with all technical and musical support from Teesdale Community Resources (TCR). 

The TCR Hub is a community centre on the edge of the town with a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities.

The Barnard Castle Band, founded in 1860, is a brass band based in the town, well known outside the area as a result of the march &quot;Barnard Castle&quot; by Goff Richards.

==Economy==
Pureland Industrial Complex was established in the early 1970s when 45 farms covering were assembled in Logan Township. Under the ownership of State Mutual Life Assurance Company of America, environmental studies were undertaken by Jack McCormick, the first scientist with a doctorate in environmental science. In 1971, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the project as &quot;the nation&#x27;s first ecologically planned industrial complex&quot;.

In 1973, the Pureland Association was formed and Declaration of Environmental Standards were established and recorded in Gloucester County. Approximately were placed in an environmental reserve in perpetuity and rigid environmental controls were established, prior to the establishment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. These restrictive covenants protect property owners&#x27; value and are enforced by the Pureland Association which consist of property owners.

In 1976, the initial infrastructure was established with public water, sewer, and rail servicing Pureland. In 1977, Center Square Real Estate Development Company took over management of Pureland for State Mutual Life Assurance Company of America. In 2000, Center Square Real Estate Development Company purchased the undeveloped land from State Mutual and continues to manage and develop Pureland today.

Pureland consists of of space and houses more than 180 companies employing over 8,500 people, mostly in warehousing and distribution. It is the largest industrial complex in New Jersey.

Logan Township was the proposed location for the Crown Landing LNG Terminal, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) off-loading and processing facility to be sited along the Delaware River. The facility would have included an off-loading pier that would technically enter the waters of the state of Delaware. Delaware opposed the project and filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the project from going forward on the basis that they control the waters in which part of the pier would be situated; a lawsuit the State of Delaware lost. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the Crown Landing LNG Terminal on June 15, 2006. In 2009, long after the project should have been completed, Hess Energy acquired the project after BP failed to get plans approved and construction started. On January 6, 2012, Hess Energy surrendered its authorization to construct and operate the terminal. In a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Hess said it determined that the terminal would not be profitable, saying that &quot;significant increases in natural gas production from North American shale resources&quot; would affect prices and demand for natural gas.

<text>Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh (Edward Antony Richard Louis; born 10 March 1964) is a member of the British royal family. He is the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and the youngest sibling of King Charles III. He was born 3rd in the line of succession to the British throne and is now 15th.

Born at Buckingham Palace during the reign of his mother, Edward studied at Heatherdown School and completed his A-Levels at Gordonstoun before spending part of his gap year teaching at Wanganui Collegiate School in New Zealand. He then went up to read history at Jesus College, Cambridge, graduating in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Cambridge. After a brief stint in the Royal Marines, he worked as a theatre production assistant at the Really Useful Theatre Company before assisting in television production. He later formed his own company, Ardent Productions.

Edward stepped down from the company in 2002 to begin full-time duties as a working member of the royal family, and undertook engagements on behalf of his mother. He holds patronage with over 70 charities and organisations, including the National Youth Theatre, the Sport and Recreation Alliance and the British Paralympic Association. His charity work focuses on the arts, athletics, and the development of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award, which centres on fitness, wellbeing and community service.

Edward was given the title of Earl of Wessex prior to marrying Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999. They have two children: Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James Mountbatten-Windsor, Earl of Wessex. Edward&#x27;s mother conferred him the additional title of Earl of Forfar in 2019. On Edward&#x27;s 59th birthday in 2023, his brother Charles III granted him the title Duke of Edinburgh as a life peerage, a dukedom previously held by their father, who died in 2021, then briefly by Charles himself.

== Early life and education ==

Prince Edward was born at 20:20 (GMT) on 10 March 1964 at Buckingham Palace, London, as the third son and the fourth and youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He is the most recent child to be born to a reigning British monarch. His birth was the only one witnessed by his father. He was baptised on 2 May 1964 in the private chapel at Windsor Castle.

As with his three older siblings, Charles, Anne, and Andrew, a governess was appointed to look after Edward and was responsible for his early education at Buckingham Palace before he attended Collingham College, Kensington (then known as Gibbs School). In September 1972, he joined Heatherdown School, near Ascot in Berkshire. Later, as his father and elder brothers had done before him, he moved to Gordonstoun in northern Scotland, where he was appointed head boy in his last term. Edward obtained a C-grade in English and two D-grades in history and politics at A-level, and after leaving school spent a gap year abroad, working as a house tutor and junior master for two terms at the Wanganui Collegiate School in New Zealand.

Upon his return to the United Kingdom, Edward studied at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he read history. His admission to the university despite poor A-Level results caused some comment. Edward graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts degree (Lower Second Hons).

== Post-university ==

===Royal Marines===

After graduating in 1986, Edward joined the Royal Marines, who had reportedly sponsored his tuition at Cambridge on condition of future service. He had signed up to join the Royal Marines in September 1983. In January 1987, he dropped out of the commando course having completed one-third of the 12-month training. Media reported that Prince Philip, who was the Captain General Royal Marines, was displeased, but Prince Edward later said that his father had not put undue pressure on him to change his mind. Others stated that Philip was the most sympathetic family member toward his son&#x27;s decision. Buckingham Palace said that Edward&#x27;s decision came after &quot;much consideration&quot; and that he was leaving with great regret &quot;but has concluded that he does not wish to make the service his long-term career&quot;.

===Theatre and television===

After leaving military service, Edward opted to pursue a career in entertainment. He commissioned the 1986 musical &quot;Cricket&quot; from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, for his mother&#x27;s 60th birthday celebration, which led to a job offer at Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Theatre Company, where he worked as a production assistant on musicals such as &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, and &quot;Cats&quot;. While there he met actress Ruthie Henshall, whom he dated for three years.

Edward&#x27;s first foray into television production was the programme &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot;, informally known as &quot;It&#x27;s a Royal Knockout&quot;, on 15 June 1987, in which four teams sponsored by him, his siblings Anne and Andrew, and Andrew&#x27;s wife Sarah competed for charity. The programme was criticised by the media and the public, and it was later reported that the Queen was not in favour of the event, with her courtiers having advised against it. The programme raised over £1,500,000 for its selected charities.

===Ardent Productions===

In 1993, Edward founded the television production company Ardent Productions. Ardent was involved in the production of a number of documentaries and dramas, but Edward was accused in the media of using his royal connections for financial gain, and the company was referred to by some industry insiders as &quot;a sad joke&quot; due to a perceived lack of professionalism in its operations. Andy Beckett, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, opined that &quot;to watch Ardent&#x27;s few dozen hours of broadcast output is to enter a strange kingdom where every man in Britain still wears a tie, where pieces to camera are done in cricket jumpers, where people clasp their hands behind their backs like guardsmen. Commercial breaks are filled with army recruiting advertisements&quot;.

Ardent&#x27;s productions were better received in the United States and a documentary Edward made about his great-uncle Edward VIII (the late Duke of Windsor) in 1996 sold well worldwide. Nonetheless, the company reported losses every year it operated, with the exception of one when Edward did not draw a salary. An Ardent two-man film crew later allegedly invaded the privacy of Edward&#x27;s nephew, Prince William, in September 2001, when he was studying at the University of St Andrews, which went against industry guidelines regarding the privacy of members of the royal family; William&#x27;s father (Edward&#x27;s elder brother Charles) was reportedly angered by the incident. In March 2002, Edward announced that he would step down as production director and joint managing director of Ardent to concentrate on his public duties and to support the Queen during her Golden Jubilee year. Ardent Productions was voluntarily dissolved in June 2009, with assets reduced to just £40.

==Marriage and children==

Edward met Sophie Rhys-Jones for the first time in 1987 when he was dating her friend. They met again at a promotion shoot for the Prince Edward Summer Challenge to raise money for charity in 1993, and the two began their relationship soon afterwards. In December 1993 and amid growing speculation about whether they were planning to marry, Edward wrote a letter to newspaper editors, in which he denied any wedding plans and asked the media to respect their privacy. Edward proposed to Sophie on holiday in the Bahamas in December 1998 and their engagement was announced on 6 January 1999. Edward proposed to Sophie with an Asprey and Garrard engagement ring worth an estimated £105,000: a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-carat white gold.

Their wedding took place on 19 June 1999 in St George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Castle. This was a departure from the weddings of his elder brothers, which were large, formal events at Westminster Abbey or St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and had ended in divorce. On his wedding day, Prince Edward was created Earl of Wessex, with the subsidiary title of Viscount Severn (alluding to the Welsh roots of the Countess&#x27;s family), breaking from a tradition whereby sons of the sovereign were created royal dukes.

Sophie had an ectopic pregnancy in 2001. Edward and Sophie have two children: Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor, born prematurely on 8 November 2003 due to a sudden placental abruption; and James Mountbatten-Windsor (then Viscount Severn, now Earl of Wessex), born on 17 December 2007. Edward&#x27;s children since 2023 are styled as the children of a duke, rather than as &quot;Prince/ss&quot; and &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. The family&#x27;s country seat is Bagshot Park; their office and official London residence is at Buckingham Palace.

==Activities==

The Earl and Countess of Wessex established their foundation, the Wessex Youth Trust, in 1999, with a focus on helping, supporting and advancing registered charities which provide opportunities specifically for children and young people. His patronages include: the British Paralympic Association, the International Real Tennis Professionals Association, the Commonwealth Games Federation, BadmintonScotland, the Tennis and Rackets Association, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, London Mozart Players, Haddo House Choral and Operatic Society, Northern Ballet, the Edinburgh International Festival, the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire, the Production Guild, and the National Youth Theatre.

The Earl of Wessex assumed many duties from his father, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as Prince Philip reduced his commitments before retiring from royal duties. Prince Edward opened the 1990 Commonwealth Games in New Zealand and the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Malaysia and became vice-patron of Commonwealth Games Federation in 2006, picking up his father&#x27;s ceremonial duties who had served as president. He has also taken over his father&#x27;s role in the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award (DofE) scheme, attending Gold Award ceremonies around the world.

In September 2007, the Earl visited Israel in his capacity as Chairman of the International Council of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award to attend a number of events organised by the Israel Youth Award program, an affiliate of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award. Edward was himself a recipient of the Award&#x27;s gold medal in 1986 for &quot;a 60-mile, four-day trek from Blair Atholl to Tomintoul&quot; that he had planned. He has been a trustee of the DofE since 1988 and of the International Award since 2006. Edward later went on to become Chair of trustees of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s International Award in 2015, and was named patron of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award in 2023. He has promoted the charity&#x27;s work on different occasions. Edward is also a trustee of the International Award Association, which &quot;encompasses the DofE UK and all its other 61 National Award Authorities across the globe&quot;. He was also Chairman of the DofE&#x27;s international council and in 1999 founded the International Special Projects Group &quot;to provide a capital fund to broaden the reach of the Award&quot;. In 2018, Edward, as patron of the Tennis and Rackets Association, played on all 50 real tennis courts around the world and raised over £2 million for the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award scheme.

In June 2011, Edward visited Baltimore to meet the students and staff of the Living Classrooms Foundation and encourage them to participate in the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award&#x27;s programme. In December 2011, the Earl and Countess of Wessex visited troops in Afghanistan. On the same trip, the royal couple visited Bahrain, and received two gifts of jewels from the Bahraini royal family and Prime Minister. Given concern about human rights abuses in Bahrain, this gift attracted controversy, with calls for the jewels to be sold, and the proceeds used for the benefit of the Bahraini people. In February and March 2012, the couple visited the Caribbean for the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The itinerary consisted of Saint Lucia; Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Grenada; Trinidad and Tobago; Montserrat; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Anguilla; Antigua and Barbuda. Highlights included Independence Day celebrations in Saint Lucia, addressing Senate and Assembly of Barbados jointly, and a visit to sites affected by the volcanic eruptions in Montserrat.

In 2013, the couple visited South Africa. The Queen appointed the Earl of Wessex as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2014. In 2015, for his contributions to projects associated with badminton, Edward was awarded the President&#x27;s Medal by the Badminton World Federation President Poul-Erik Høyer. In May 2016, the Earl visited Ghana. Alongside President Mahama, he presented young people with the Head of State Awards for their participation in the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s International Award Scheme. In September 2016, Edward travelled to Chile as a part of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award&#x27;s diamond anniversary, and visited projects by British and Commonwealth Fire and Rescue Company and Chilean-British Culture University, of which he is an honorary member and patron respectively. The Earl and Countess of Wessex represented the Queen at the 50th Anniversary Celebrations of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah&#x27;s Accession to the Throne of Brunei in October 2017. In February 2018, the Earl and Countess toured Sri Lanka, participating in the 70th Independence Day celebrations in Colombo. In April 2018, the Earl visited Australia to attend the XXI Commonwealth Games and attend fundraising events for those participating in the Duke of Edinburgh Award challenges.

Twenty years after its inception, the Wessex Youth Trust changed its name to the Earl and Countess of Wessex Charitable Trust, managed by the private office of the Earl and Countess of Wessex and Forfar. The trust will continue to develop sustainable relationships with a range of selected partner charities, and will expand its remit beyond supporting children and young people.

In July 2019, the Earl and Countess visited Forfar on their first official visit to the royal burgh since the Queen granted Prince Edward the additional title Earl of Forfar in March 2019. The Earl was presented with &#x27;Earl of Forfar&#x27; tartan, which was designed by Forfar&#x27;s Strathmore Woollen Company to celebrate their new titles. In 2020, he took over the patronage of London Youth from his father who had held the position for 73 years.

In February 2022, Edward was appointed president of the Royal Windsor Horse Show, a position previously held by his father Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. In the following month, he visited Kenya to oversee the progress of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s International Award in the country. In April 2022, the Earl and Countess of Wessex and Forfar toured Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Antigua and Barbuda to mark the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee. Their planned visit to Grenada was postponed after talks with the island&#x27;s government and governor-general, and the couple expressed their hopes to visit the country on a later date. In 2022 and in recognition of his role as patron of the Production Guild, the Earl of Wessex Award was created as part of the Guild&#x27;s inaugural Talent Showcase to recognise UK film and TV organisations who have created &quot;a successful way of inspiring local talent or skills, widening access or being more inclusive.&quot; After he was created Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, Edward and Sophie visited Edinburgh to meet with members of the Ukrainian and Eastern European communities in the city, some of whom were displaced following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Edward became patron of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award upon being raised to the dukedom.

==In the media==
In 1999, Edward was criticised by Labour MPs John Cryer and Lindsay Hoyle for comments he made during an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in which he stated that in Britain &quot;They hate anyone who succeeds&quot; and &quot;America is where the money is&quot;. The criticism prompted him to issue a statement, clarifying &quot;that offending the British public was the very last thing I would have wanted to do&quot;.

In 2011, close associates of Jonathan Rees, a private investigator connected to the &quot;News International&quot; phone hacking scandal, stated that he had penetrated Edward and Sophie&#x27;s bank accounts and sold details about them to the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==

===Titles and styles===
Until his marriage, Edward was known as &quot;His Royal Highness The Prince Edward&quot;. On 19 June 1999, he became &quot;His Royal Highness The Earl of Wessex&quot;. Buckingham Palace announced the intention that Edward would eventually be created Duke of Edinburgh, a title then held by his father, Prince Philip, once it had merged in the Crown upon the death of both his parents. On 10 March 2019, his 55th birthday, Edward was granted the additional title of Earl of Forfar for use in Scotland. On his 59th birthday, 10 March 2023, Edward was created Duke of Edinburgh, thus becoming &quot;His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh&quot;. His ducal title is not hereditary, so it will revert to the crown on his death.

In 1994, the Independent Royalist Party of Estonia, aspiring to make Estonia a monarchy, sent a letter to Queen Elizabeth II requesting permission to crown Prince Edward as King of Estonia. The letter had called Edward a &quot;young British prince much admired by Estonians&quot;, adding the party &quot;would be most honoured if you would accept this rare request&quot;. Buckingham Palace declined the offer, saying that it was &quot;a charming idea but a rather unlikely one&quot;.

===Honours===
Edward is a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, an Extra Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, and a Personal Aide-de-Camp to the Sovereign. In 2013 Edward received a Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bath.

===American Revolutionary War===
In 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Army under command of George Washington constructed two forts on the Delaware River to block the approach to Philadelphia: Fort Mifflin on the Pennsylvania side and Fort Mercer on the New Jersey side, which is now National Park. The fort was named in honor of Brigadier General Hugh Mercer, who died earlier that year in the Battle of Princeton. A park, monument, and museum commemorate Fort Mifflin on its original site.

On October 22, 1777, in the Battle of Red Bank, an attack by 900 Hessian troops, serving under British Major General William Howe, who then occupied Philadelphia, was repelled, with heavy losses on the Hessian side, including the death of their commander, Colonel Carl Emil Kurt von Donop, by the 600 Continental Army defenders under Colonel Christopher Greene. After the loss of Fort Mifflin, Fort Mercer was abandoned without a fight when Lord Charles Cornwallis landed 2,000 British troops nearby on November 18.

==Government==
===Local government===
Newfield is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Newfield is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Newfield Borough is Republican Charles Grova Jr., whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Newfield Borough Council are Council President Michael Carrow (R, 2026), Thomas D. Corwonski (D, 2025), Joseph Curcoio III (D, 2026), Jennifer Marandino (2025), Scott C. Miller (D, 2027) and Christina Renzi (R, 2027).

Resident committees were formed in September 2013, which announced that they would mount a petition drive to recall council members Michael Carrow and Everett Marshall III, in the wake of a conflict between the borough council and the volunteer fire department, in which the council passed an ordinance giving the borough control over the fire department and in response the fire company threatened to close in October if the ordinance wasn&#x27;t overturned.

In January 2015, the borough council selected Stephen Boyle from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the vacant council seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by Donald Sullivan until he took office as mayor. In the November 2015 general election, Boyle was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

In August 2019, Christina Pierce was appointed by the borough council to fill the seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held by Patricia M. Purdy. In the November 2019 general election, Pierce was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

<text>Paulsboro is a borough situated on the banks of the Delaware River in Gloucester County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, within the Philadelphia metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 6,196, an increase of 99 (+1.6%) from the 6,097 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn had reflected a decline of 63 (−1.0%) from the 6,160 counted in the 2000 census. Paulsboro and surrounding Gloucester County constitute part of South Jersey.

Paulsboro was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 2, 1904, from portions of Greenwich Township. It was named for Samuel Phillip Paul, son of a settler.

==History==
===18th century===

Paulsboro is the home of Fort Billingsport, the first land purchase made by the United States, acquired on July 5, 1776, the day after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

===19th century===
Paulsboro is the location of the Tinicum Island Rear Range Light house, first lit on the night of December 31, 1880.

===20th century===
In 1997, a local citizens&#x27; group was established with the purpose of providing tours and public access to the structure. The lighthouse is one of New Jersey&#x27;s few publicly accessible aids to navigation and is the centerpiece of Paulsboro&#x27;s cultural revitalization.

The East Jefferson Street Railroad Bridge over Mantua Creek was built in 1917 and rebuilt in 1940 for the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines (PRSL). It is now part of Conrail&#x27;s Penns Grove Secondary.

===21st century===

On November 30, 2012, the East Jefferson Street Railroad Bridge buckled, causing seven cars of a freight train to derail. One of the four tanker cars that fell into the creek was punctured, leaking thousands of gallons of vinyl chloride. Homes in the borough had to be evacuated and dozens of people went to hospitals as a precautionary measure due to exposure to the chemicals. Some residents in the area have filed suit against Conrail and CSX in Pennsylvania State Court having &quot;complained about respiratory and bronchial related illnesses, headaches, eye and skin irritations and multiple other symptoms.&quot;

In March 2013, Conrail announced that the bridge would be replaced with an expected September 2014 operational date. Normally, between March 1 and November 30 the bridge is left in the open position for maritime traffic and closed when trains approach. It will remain locked in the closed position until the bridge is replaced. In September 2013, another less serious derailment took place along the border of Gibbstown (in Greenwich Township) and Paulsboro, with one car leaving the tracks on a train consisting mostly of empty tanker cars.

<text>Pitman is a borough in Gloucester County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,780, a decrease of 231 (−2.6%) from the 2010 census count of 9,011, which in turn reflected a decline of 320 (−3.4%) from the 9,331 in the 2000 census. The borough was named for Rev. Charles Pitman, a Methodist minister.

==History==

In 1871, land was chosen in both Glassboro and Mantua Township to be set aside for a Methodist summer camp meeting. The New Jersey Conference Camp Meeting Association was officially chartered and given authority over the land grant in 1872, and began planning the campground and organizing meetings. The land had an auditorium located on a central meeting ground, and twelve roads originated from the central area as spokes on a wheel.

This area became known as the Pitman Grove, and while worshipers&#x27; tents originally lined each of the twelve roads, cottages slowly replaced the tents and formed the foundation of the town of Pitman. By the 1880s, the number of cottages had climbed to 400 and residents had begun staying year-round, both of which led to the establishment of the first public school in 1884. By 1887, businesses had cropped up north of the Grove in an area then-named Arbutus Hill, and in 1892, Alcyon Park was established. The Grove directors resisted the secularization of the Methodist retreat, but in 1904, Grove residents voted 122 to 35 for incorporation as an autonomous borough. On May 24, 1905, Governor of New Jersey Edward C. Stokes signed a law granting the incorporation.

The Pitman Grove was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

Until August 2014, Pitman was a dry town. In 2015, the borough council authorized an ordinance permitting liquor licenses and a pair of local breweries opened in Pitman&#x27;s Uptown business district in 2016 under the terms of a state law that allows the sale of beer by the glass in tasting rooms. In November 2016, nearly 65% of voters approved a non-binding referendum allowing the issuance of liquor licenses.

The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor.

, members of the South Harrison Township Committee are Mayor Joseph Marino (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2027; term as mayor ends 2025), Deputy Mayor Robert J. Diaz (R, term on committee ends 2026; term as deputy mayor ends 2025), John Horner (R, 2027), Robert L. Richardson (R, 2025) and Robert Schenk (R, 2026).

In 2007, Charles Tyson was elected Mayor, the first African American to hold the post. He was re-elected in 2008. In 2009, however, he declined to seek re-election to a third term, citing the death threats and racist vandalism that had arisen. He had received threatening phone calls and emails, his tires were slashed, and &quot;KKK&quot; was written on a sign on his lawn. A federal indictment has charged a white supremacist from Virginia, Bill White, with &quot;communicating threats in interstate commerce&quot;, based on White&#x27;s emails to Tyson and phone calls to Tyson&#x27;s wife in 2008. No arrests have been made, however, in connection with the incidents in 2007, even though the town posted a $24,000 reward.

=== Federal, state, and county representation ===
South Harrison Township is located in the 2nd Congressional District and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s 3rd state legislative district.

<text>Swedesboro is a borough within Gloucester County in the U.S. state of New Jersey, within the Philadelphia metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 2,711, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 127 (+4.9%) from the 2,584 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 529 (+25.7%) from the 2,055 counted in the 2000 census. Swedesboro and surrounding Gloucester County constitute part of South Jersey.

Swedesboro was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 9, 1902, from portions of Woolwich Township. The borough was named for its early settlers from Sweden.

Swedesboro has been recognized by the National Arbor Day Foundation as a Tree City USA since 2000.

==History==
Originally populated by the Lenape Native Americans, Swedesboro was settled as part of New Sweden around 1650. The Swedes and Finns were fishermen, hunters and farmers.

Swedesboro, initially named Sveaborg by the Swedish settlers, along with Bridgeport (Nya Stockholm) and Finns Point (Varkens Kill), was one of only three settlements established in New Jersey as a part of the New Sweden colony. The oldest extant log cabin in the U.S., C. A. Nothnagle Log House () was built by Antti Niilonpoika (Anthony Neilson/Nelson) in Swedesboro. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is Trinity Episcopal &quot;Old Swedes&quot; Church, which was established as a Swedish Lutheran Church in 1703; the present building dates to 1784.

As a result of the Second Northern War, New Sweden passed into Dutch hands in 1655. In 1667, the English subsequently annexed the region along the Delaware River after the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The English Colonial government needed a road between the communities of Burlington and Salem and built the Kings Highway in 1691, which opened the southern portion of Gloucester County to more settlers, who were drawn to the area by the fertile sandy soil, prime farmland and vast tracts of oak, birch, maple and pine trees. Originally, the community was called Raccoon until it was changed to Swedesboro in 1765.

Through the late 1800s, Raccoon Creek, which runs for , was a navigable water route that was naturally deep enough to transport wood and farm produce to Philadelphia via the Delaware River. The creek was named for the Narraticon Native Americans who lived in the area and gave their name as Raccoon to the first European settlement. The Van Leer Log Cabin was once used as a trading post with Native Americans and later a station for the Underground Railroad to help slaves escape to free negro communities.

Trinity Church Cemetery is the burial place of Governor of New Jersey Charles C. Stratton, Congressman Benjamin Franklin Howey, and other notables.

Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden, visited the borough as part of a 1976 tour of the United States.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.77 square miles (1.99 km2), including 0.73 square miles (1.89 km2) of land and 0.04 square miles (0.09 km2) of water (4.55%).

Unincorporated communities, localities, and places located partially or completely within the township include Ivyside. Swedesboro is an independent municipality surrounded on all sides by Woolwich Township, making it one of only 21 &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.
