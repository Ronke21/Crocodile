<text>Desloge ( ) is a city in St. Francois County, Missouri, United States. The population was 5,054 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
The city was founded by Firmin V. Desloge II, son of Firmin René Desloge, who migrated from France, settled in Potosi, and began the Desloge Family in America. Firmin V. Desloge II learned about mining from his father and acquired many claims in the area of what is today Desloge and Bonne Terre. A
Desloge developed one of his claims just north of Bonne Terre and built a concentrating plant there. After the plant was destroyed by fire in 1883, Desloge explored his properties in the present area of Desloge and consolidated several local mining companies which became known as the Desloge Consolidated Lead Company. In 1887, the land was cleared and company houses for his staff were constructed in an area referred to as &quot;Desloge Town&quot;, just west of the present-day railroad tracks. Here, Desloge sank a shaft and built a concentrating plant which began operations in 1892. Desloge Missouri and the regional Southeast Missouri Lead Mining District became one of the principal lead mining centers in the US. In 1929, the family sold the Desloge Consolidated Lead Company to the St. Joe Lead Company.

Firmin Desloge II, who died in 1930, willed to his family the original of the hand-dug pits of the original lead mining operations and the deeply rutted wagon tracks on a property. The family then donated this land for a park, today named Firmin Desloge Park, and dedicated it to the mining families in the area.

Firmin Desloge moved to St. Louis in the early 1900s. His son, Firmin Desloge III, was superintendent of mines until he moved his family — including his sons Firmin V. Desloge IV, William Livingston Desloge, and Theodore P. Desloge — to St. Louis in 1921.

The city of Desloge was incorporated on March 7, 1941, with D.E. Brown as its first mayor.

In June 2012, three great-great-grandsons of city founder Firmin Desloge II attended a dedication of a bronze medallion donated by great-grandson Steven Rockwell Desloge.

<text>Farmington is a city in St. Francois County located about southwest of St. Louis in the Lead Belt region in Missouri. As of the 2020 census, the population was 18,217. It is the county seat of St. Francois County. Farmington was established in 1822 as Murphy&#x27;s Settlement, named for William Murphy of Kentucky, who first visited the site in 1798. When St. Francois County was organized, the town was briefly called St. Francois Court House and later renamed to Farmington.

==History==
William Murphy migrated from Kentucky to this former area of La Louisiane west of the Mississippi River in 1798, when it was under Spanish rule. Calderon was searching for the ideal site to relocate his family. Tradition holds that he was aided by a local Native American, likely Osage, in finding a spring near here.

Deciding that this was an excellent place to settle, Murphy acquired a Spanish Land Grant, allowing him and his family to found a community along the St. Francois River.

In his travels back to Kentucky, Murphy died. His wife Sarah and their grown sons carried out establishing the settlement around 1800. They named it Murphy&#x27;s Settlement. Sarah is known to have founded the first Protestant Sunday School west of the Mississippi River. Because Spanish law barred any religious services that were not Roman Catholic, Sarah and her students conducted classes in secret.

The United States acquired this area as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. It was later designated as part of the Missouri Territory. A post office in Murphy&#x27;s Settlement was opened in 1817.

Missouri was admitted as a state in 1821 as part of the Missouri Compromise. In 1822, William Crawford Murphy contributed of land here for the county seat of what was soon to be St. Francois County.

Murphy&#x27;s Settlement was renamed Farmington in 1825, taking the name from the area&#x27;s rich farm land. Farmington was granted incorporation as a town in 1836 and became a village 20 years later in 1856.

In the mid-19th century, Farmington enjoyed growth from construction of the historic Plank Road, which stretched from Pilot Knob to Ste. Genevieve. It improved the village&#x27;s access to supplies and markets along the river.

The road was built both to transport supplies from the shipping facilities located along the river to the mines and to move the mines&#x27; iron ore to the shipping facilities. This route was soon taken over by the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway.

The first public school was constructed in 1870 and in 1879. Farmington gained recognition as a fourth-class city. In 1981 Farmington became a third-class city.

The Courthouse Square Historic District, East Columbia Historic District, Farmington State Hospital No. 4 Cemetery, James Robinson McCormick House, Presbyterian Orphanage of Missouri, and St. Francois County Jail and Sheriff&#x27;s Residence are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Park Hills is located 7 miles northwest of Farmington, Missouri and approximately 65 miles south of St. Louis. It is adjacent to St. Joe State Park, and nearby the state parks of St. Francois, Hawn, Elephant Rocks, Johnson&#x27;s Shut-Ins, Taum Sauk Mountain, and Washington.

<text>Bellefontaine Neighbors ( ) is an inner-ring suburban city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 10,740 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

The history of Bellefontaine Neighbors, Missouri, can be traced back to the mid-1800s when the area was part of the Louisiana Territory, which was ceded by France to Spain in 1762 in the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Spanish military authorities constructed forts near the mouth of the Missouri River to strengthen their hold on the territory and discourage intruders from the east. A Captain Rios, who was dispatched to the area, established forts near the present-day locations of Spanish Pond (or Spanish Lake) and Fort San Carlos in St. Louis.

In 1800, Spain ceded the territory west of the Mississippi River back to France, which then sold it to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1804, a treaty was made with the Sac and Fox Indians that led to the establishment of a trading post on the south bank of the Missouri River. The area was chosen for its natural advantages, including a large clear water spring called &quot;la belle fontaine&quot; by the early French settlers.

By the winter of 1805, Fort Bellefontaine was constructed under the command of Colonel Jacob Kingsbury, with log cabins, a trading house, a bakery, a blacksmith shop, and huts for enlisted soldiers. General Daniel Bissell served as the military commander of the territory and resided at Fort Bellefontaine for several years. The fort was connected to St. Louis by a trail that eventually evolved into present-day Bellefontaine Road.

Fort Bellefontaine was abandoned in 1834, and the surrounding land was divided into land grants. The area that is now Bellefontaine Neighbors was made up of land grants issued by Spanish, French, and American officials. Notable landowners in the area included General Daniel Bissell, who purchased land through public land sales, and Dr. James W. Gibson, who built his home &quot;Forest Home&quot; in the area in 1832.

The area remained primarily agricultural until the 1950s, when a building boom following World War II led to the construction of subdivisions and a population increase. Bellefontaine Neighbors was incorporated as a fourth-class city in 1950, with a population of 766 people. At the time, the city had 18 streets, one public school, and one church, the Bellefontaine Methodist Church.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population of Bellefontaine Neighbors grew rapidly, reaching 13,650 people by 1960. The growth resulted in the construction of new churches, such as St. Jerome&#x27;s Catholic Church, Our Lady of Good Counsel Catholic Church, Bellefontaine Neighbors Baptist Church, Grace Lutheran Chapel, and Frieden&#x27;s Evangelical and Reformed Church. Additionally, the number of schools in the city increased, with Gibson Elementary, Danforth Elementary, Grace Lutheran, Stormin Academy, and Riverview Gardens Senior High School now serving the community.

The city administration of Bellefontaine Neighbors has evolved since its incorporation, with A. W. Schnur appointed as the first mayor in 1950. The city is divided into four wards and operates under a Mayor-Aldermen form of government, with the mayor and aldermen elected to four-year terms. Elections are held on the first Tuesday in April.

==Economy==
Boeing Integrated Defense Systems is headquartered in Berkeley. Prior to its merger with Boeing, McDonnell Douglas was headquartered in the same complex in Berkeley. Boeing chose to locate the defense systems offices in the St. Louis area because of the metropolitan area&#x27;s central location in the United States, the role of the space and aircraft programs of the former McDonnell Douglas location, and bipartisan support from area politicians. At the site, Boeing maintains the James S. McDonnell Prologue Room, containing a museum exhibition of Boeing memorabilia. Boeing moved its defense unit to Arlington County, Virginia in 2017.

==Education==
Berkeley is within the Ferguson-Florissant School District. Airport Elementary School and Holman Elementary School serve separate sections of Berkeley and are within the city. Elementary schools outside of Berkeley serving sections of the city include Johnson-Wabash in Ferguson and Walnut Grove in Calverton Park.

Berkeley Middle School is located in Berkeley. McCluer South-Berkeley High School is in Ferguson.

The Berkeley School District opened in 1937 after a dispute over where a school for black people should be located, with the black residents of southern Kinloch and the white residents of northern Kinloch opposing each other. The newly formed school district, mostly white, took over Kinloch High School, which had opened during that year; previously a part of the Kinloch School District, the high school was renamed Berkeley High School. The high school, located in what is now Berkeley, was exclusively for white students. At a later point a new Berkeley High School campus opened in a new location, and the former Berkeley High School became Berkeley Middle School. On June 7, 1975, a U.S. district court ordered the Ferguson-Florissant School District to annex the Berkeley School District and the Kinloch School District; therefore the Ferguson-Florissant district began to serve Berkeley. In December 2003 the former Berkeley High School closed due to expansion of Lambert-St. Louis Airport. In January 2004 McCluer South-Berkeley High School opened.

==Family controversy==
In May 2006, the Black Jack city government made a controversial decision to remove an unmarried couple and their children from their own home on the grounds that the couple was not related enough to each other to satisfy a municipal ordinance. For the purpose of obtaining an occupancy permit, Black Jack defined a family as:
* An individual; or
* Two or more persons related by blood, marriage or adoption; or
* A group of not more than three persons who need not be related by blood, marriage or adoption.

Therefore, an unmarried couple with one child would qualify as a family, whereas an unmarried couple with multiple children would not.

On August 10, 2006, the ACLU of Eastern Missouri filed a lawsuit against the city, claiming violation of due process and equal protection, and violation of housing laws. On August 15 the Black Jack city council unanimously passed a resolution changing the definition of family to include an unmarried couple and their children.

<text>Brentwood is an inner-ring suburb of St. Louis, located in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 8,233 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The area that is Brentwood consists of three land purchases: that of Louis J. Bompart who acquired his lot first in 1804, that of the Gay family, and that of the Marshall family. In the 1870s, a man by the name of Thomas Madden arrived and soon became the businessman of the community. He operated a rock quarry, and constructed a tavern, a barbershop, a grocery store, and a blacksmith shop. Due to Madden&#x27;s prominence in the community, the town was then named Maddenville.

With a location on the Manchester Trail, a route that was mostly frequented by mail coaches and prairie schooners going west, Maddenville in the 1800s became a prosperous town on the outskirts of St. Louis, to which it was connected by a streetcar line.

In 1919, it was discovered by the residents of Maddenville that the inhabitants of the neighboring Maplewood were planning to elect whether or not to annex their town. To avoid annexation and to establish their own school district, the residents decided to incorporate Maddenville into a village. On December 15, 1919, the town of Maddenville officially became the village of Brentwood.

During the late 1920s, the village earned an unhealthy reputation for its numerous gambling houses and illegal activities that took place around the intersection of Manchester Road and Brentwood Boulevard. The first mayor, James L. Willingham (in office from 1929 to 1931), ran on the promise to clean Brentwood up and eliminate the casinos, along with the hoodlums who hung around them, which he did. The town then became once again attractive for families. On April 12, 1929, Willingham signed ordinance 1A, which established Brentwood as a city and determined its boundaries.

<doc id="123171" wikidata="Q957345" url="?curid=123171" title="Bridgeton, Missouri">
<text>Bridgeton is a second-ring suburb of Greater St. Louis in northwestern St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. Bridgeton is located at the intersection of the St. Louis outer belt and I-70. Bridgeton serves as the primary transport hub within Greater St. Louis. The population at the 2020 census was 11,445. Portions of St. Louis Lambert International Airport are within Bridgeton. The town is featured in the documentary &quot;Atomic Homefront&quot;, which covers the effects of radioactive waste stored in the nearby West Lake Landfill site.

==Location==
The populated areas of the city are located between Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and St. Charles. The Missouri River serves as the city&#x27;s northwestern boundary. Bridgeton is centered at 38°45&#x27;26&quot; North, 90°25&#x27;4&quot; West (38.7573, -90.4179).

The area has long been influenced by its proximity to important local transportation routes, dating back to Native American trails established by the Osage Nation. Many of those trails became the basis of the first roads in the area, such as Natural Bridge and the historic St. Charles Rock Road, which date back to the days of Spanish, French, and early American settlement. The intersection of I-70 and I-270 in this area add to air and rail access to make the area a good base for transportation-dependent industries. The recreational American Discovery Trail passes through the area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==History==

===Early history===
The first Europeans to interact with Native American peoples and settle there were associated with the area&#x27;s days as part of the French Illinois Territory. The French explorer, Étienne de Veniard de Bourgmont traveled the area in 1724, on a trail that developed as the main route between St. Louis and St. Charles.

The Spanish gained colonial control in 1768 after France was defeated by Great Britain in the Seven Years&#x27; War and ceded its territory west of the Mississippi to Spain; they remained in control until 1804, when the area was transferred to the Americans in the Louisiana Purchase. In a 1799 census, the population of &quot;Marais des Liards&quot; was given as 337 whites and 42 slaves.

Bridgeton was first platted in 1794, and named &quot;Marais des Liards&quot; (Cottonwood Swamp). It was also known as &quot;Village à Robert&quot;, named after Robert Owen, its founder, who had received a land grant from the Spanish government. In a Spanish census two years later it had a population (including slaves) of 77 males and 47 females. As the area received more and more English-speaking settlers, the village&#x27;s name became Owen&#x27;s Station.

Because of its location, including its proximity to a ferry across the Missouri River, Bridgeton became a stop along the way from St. Louis to St. Charles. Meriwether Lewis passed through on his way to meet members who were gathering as part of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The city was granted a state charter in 1843; throughout the next few years it was a stop along the way for emigrants seeking the major trailheads to the Oregon and Santa Fe trails.

The Jesuits, a Catholic religious order of priests and brothers, came to Bridgeton from St. Stanislaus Seminary and St. Ferdinand Parish of Florissant, Missouri. The order established St. Mary&#x27;s Church in 1851 as a mission to serve area Catholics; it became a full parish within its first year. The Archdiocese of St. Louis suppressed the parish in 2001 due to the expansion of Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, which caused a decline in residential population.

===Modern history===

By 1950, Bridgeton&#x27;s population was 276, lower than it had been in the late 1790s and early 19th century. The city expanded in size during the decade, growing through annexation, to . The decade included the founding of the Northwest Chamber of Commerce, the chamber of commerce for the Northwest St. Louis area, which includes Bridgeton.

This led into its period of greatest residential growth, the 1960s, during which nearly 8000 single-family homes were built. Denser development was strong during that decade as well, at nearly 2000 units. Unlike with single-family development, the multi-family development continued at about the same average pace during the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1968, the city bought the Payne-Gentry House, the oldest home in Bridgeton, from the heirs of the Payne Gentry family and built Gentry Park around the home. The home was later put on the National Register of Historic Places and contains the oldest surviving doctor&#x27;s office in Missouri.

While residential construction nearly ended in the 1990s, that decade had seen significant growth in commercial development. Levee-protected floodplains of the river, together with good access to interstate highways, rail, and the airport have translated into continued growth for Bridgeton and nearby communities, and a diversification of the city&#x27;s tax base. Proximity to Lambert-Saint Louis International Airport proved to be a mixed blessing. Starting in 1995, an expansion plan for the airport, centered on a new runway plan called W-1W, was fought (unsuccessfully) by the city. The new runway led to the elimination of 2000 homes in the city, most notably in the Carrollton subdivision, undoubtedly playing a significant role in the city&#x27;s recent population decline.

<text>Charlack is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,304 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
The name of the city is a portmanteau, derived from its location at the intersection of St. Charles Rock Road with Lackland Road.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Police department==
In 1945, the village was patrolled by Charlack&#x27;s first sheriff accompanied by two deputies. The Police Department now has eight full-time employees, a chief, a pair of sergeants and six patrolmen as well as five reserve officers. The department has approximately nine patrol vehicles ranging from 4-5 Dodge Chargers, a Ford Explorer, a Dodge Sprinter Van, and a Ford Escape Hybrid outfitted as a Mobile Radar Photo Enforcement Unit made by Redflex Systems and acquired in late 2011. It also has a Chevy van used to set up photo enforcement cameras. Dispatch is provided by St. Louis County.

Charlack began using speed cameras in March 2010. The cameras are provided by B&amp;W Sensors, a company located in St. Louis. The speed cameras are on a mobile trailer which is located on top of I-170 on the Lackland Road Overpass. Charlack&#x27;s then-police chief, Tony Umbertino, claimed that traffic fines account for about 29% of Charlack&#x27;s operating budget. According to the then- Police Chief Umbertino, &quot;The cameras have also been used on Lackland Road and Midland Road earlier in the year.&quot; Umbertino also served as the town manager.

Charlack has been criticized by the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; for painting speed camera calibration lines on the highway without obtaining the proper permission. The &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; has also reported that Charlack has complied with a previous agreement to man the speed camera stations. The department contracts with an outside vendor to collect traffic fines online.
==Education==

<text>Creve Coeur is a city located in mid St. Louis County, Missouri, United States, a part of Greater St. Louis. Its population was 18,834 at the 2020 census. Creve Coeur borders and shares a ZIP code (63141) with the neighboring city of Town and Country. It is home to the headquarters of Drury Hotels, and was the home of Monsanto until its acquisition by Bayer in 2018.

==History==
The name &quot;crève cœur&quot; (, &quot;heartbreak&quot;) is said to derive from Creve Coeur Lake. According to the city&#x27;s website, the tale goes that the lake &quot;formed itself into a broken heart&quot; after an Indian princess&#x27;s unrequited love for a French fur trapper led her to jump &quot;from a ledge overlooking&quot; the lake.

Written accounts and archaeological finds show that Native Americans inhabited the Creve Coeur area from 9500 BC to 1800 AD. French explorers began farming and fishing in the area in the early 18th century, and fur trappers settled there in the early 19th century. When the area was acquired by the United States through the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Lewis and Clark Expedition came through Creve Coeur. During the American Civil War, men from the area served on both sides of the conflict, but most residents were southern sympathizers.

Creve Coeur was incorporated in 1949. Although cabins more than 200 years old (including two still in Conway Park) are in the community, it grew primarily as a stopping point along Olive Boulevard (now Route 340) between University City and Creve Coeur Lake. It expanded faster following construction of Interstate 270 and U.S. Route 40.

<text>Des Peres () is a city in west St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 8,373 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The first inhabitants of Des Peres were the Cahokia, the Kaskaskia, the Mitchigamea, the Moingona, and the Otoe peoples. As well as the Missouria, and Osage, and Tamaroa peoples.

The Osage Nation lived in the area around Des Peres. The Osage were members of the Dhegiha Sioux group of tribes. This group also included the Ponca tribe, Quapaw tribe, Kansas tribe, and Omaha tribe.

Des Peres is thought to be the oldest white settlement in Missouri, founded about December 3, 1700 by a group of Kaskaskia Native Americans and French who had left the camp of the confederated Illinois tribes on the Illinois River. The settlement was called Des Peres, French for &quot;The Fathers,&quot; and meant to honor the French Jesuit missionaries who settled there. This settlement was at the mouth of River des Peres and it is thought the first settlers found this region unhealthful, so moved across the Mississippi River to a prairie about 25 miles from the mouth of the Kaskaskia River.

People of European descent began settling in Des Peres in the 1800s. By 1850, there were 75,000 people living in St. Louis. Des Peres was mainly settled by German immigrants and southerners from Virginia and the Carolinas who were drawn to the area by the farmland sold off by the United States government in tracts.

Des Peres got its name from the River des Peres whose tributaries, Deer Creek and Two Mile Creek, ran through the town. The name &quot;Des Pères&quot; is a French term which means &quot;of the Fathers&quot;.

In 1834 a small church, the Des Peres Presbyterian Church, 38°37′22″N 90°25′12″W
(Old Des Peres Church;Old Stone Church) is a historic church on Geyer Road in Frontenac, Missouri. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Mark Becker has been mayor of the city since 2018.

<text>Ellisville is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States, within Greater St. Louis. It is a western outer-ring suburb of St. Louis. The population was 9,985 at the 2020 census.

In 2009, &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Ellisville #25 on the annual Best Places to Live in America list. The city is also currently home to an EPA Superfund site.

== History ==
Ellisville was settled by Captain James Harvey Ferris of Kentucky before 1837. He brought slaves with him when he settled his property south of Manchester and west of Kiefer Creek Road, and it was here the house that became known as the &quot;Ellis House&quot; was constructed. The bricks used for construction of the house were handmade by the slaves; it was also called the &quot;Brick Place&quot; for this reason.

Captain Ferris sold the house to Vespasian Ellis, a newspaper editor in St. Louis. The &quot;Old School Democrat&quot;, the &quot;Native American Bulletin&quot;, the &quot;Washington Temperance Paper&quot;, and &quot;The Native American&quot; were among Ellis&#x27; work. In 1842, Ellis became the United States consul to Venezuela. He ran several ads in the &quot;Native American Bulletin&quot; in an effort to sell his Ellisville farm. As a result, it was sold to William A. Hereford in 1842 or 1843. Hereford was a Virginian and is credited with the naming of Ellisville after his former post office in Ellisville, Virginia. Hereford opened the first post office here on May 2, 1843. Some believe that the Ellis House itself actually served as the post office for a time. All historical accounts of the area give the same history, but none state clearly whether the town was named for Vespasian Ellis or by William Hereford for his Virginia post office.

Hereford sold to Samuel Wilson, and he sold to Major Clarkson of Kentucky for whom Clarkson Road is named. Major Clarkson sold to Captain Benjamin F. Hutchinson of Kentucky, a steamboat captain and the owner of at least three steamboats. Captain Hutchinson raised fine horses and planted extensive orchards, greatly improving the surrounding countryside. In 1868, Captain Hutchinson subdivided his farm into small lots.

Adam Doering purchased the brick house and a considerable portion of the land. John Henry William Rasch purchased the house about 1896 from the Doerings. The Ellisville House stood until 1969 when it was razed.

<text>Fenton is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States, and a suburb of St. Louis County. The population was 3,989 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Due to its proximity to fertile land and the Meramec River, the Fenton area has been inhabited for over 900 years. The earliest proof of ancient dwellers was excavated from the &quot;Fenton Mounds&quot;, two conical earthen burial mounds located near the southwestern border of Fenton. Diagnostic pottery shards from the mounds indicate they date from the Mississippian times, A.D. 1050 - 1400. In 2001, the mounds were leveled, by developer Gary Grewe, for construction of a Walmart Supercenter.

The Fenton territory was occupied by Native Americans and early settlers in the 1770s. William Lindsay Long founded the city of Fenton on March 23, 1818. The original eight-square-block area is now referred to as &quot;Old Towne Fenton&quot;. The city remained unincorporated for the next 130 years. Garrett Hitzert was the city&#x27;s first mayor after incorporation in 1948, and his leadership helped build the foundation that much of the city&#x27;s ongoing prosperity has been based on. He conceived of Fenton&#x27;s expansive commercial business and industrial district that is a centerpiece of the city&#x27;s fiscal success.

==Geography==
Fenton is located approximately two miles south of I-44 along the west bank of the Meramec River. The intersection of Missouri routes 30 and 141 lies just to the west.

The City has seven fully developed parks on 350-plus acres, including soccer fields, ball diamonds, sand volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts, playgrounds, fishing ponds, and approximately three miles of bike/pedestrian paths through the City. The parks include: Fenton City Park, Bud Weil Memorial Park, Fenton Meramec Greenway, Olde Towne Plaza Riverside Park, Valiant Park, and Westside Park. Plans are being developed for the former Fabick property in the heart of the City. These plans include trails and some passive uses.

In the spring of 2004 the Mayor of Fenton, Dennis J. Hancock, and the members of the Park Board (Board Chair Glen Scholle and members Jeff Bodi, Charles Jahneke, Mike Lucas, Steve Covault, Gregg Cleveland, Diana Biras and Nannette Clark) determined that their city should build a memorial to the victims of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It was also determined that the memorial would honor police, firefighters, EMS personnel, and all veterans.

<text>Ferguson is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. It is part of the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area. Per the 2020 census, the population was 18,527, and predominantly black.

==History==
What is now the city of Ferguson was founded in 1855, when William B. Ferguson deeded of land to the Wabash Railroad in exchange for a new depot and naming rights. The settlement that sprang up around the depot was called Ferguson Station. Ferguson was the first railroad station connected directly to St. Louis. The station is a focal point of the city&#x27;s history and is depicted on the city flag, designed in 1994.

Ferguson&#x27;s first schoolhouse was built in 1878. Ferguson was incorporated as a city in 1894.

Emerson Electric moved its headquarters to Ferguson during the 20th century.

Ferguson made frequent worldwide headlines for months following the 2014 killing of Michael Brown Jr. by a police officer and the ensuing civil unrest. The United States Department of Justice investigation which followed resulted in large legal fees for the town, in excess of $300,000 a year. The investigation determined that the shooting was justified.

Ferguson elected its first black and first female mayor, Ella Jones, on June 2, 2020.

==Demographics==
The population of Ferguson grew rapidly during the late nineteenth century. In 1880 the population of the then Ferguson Station was 185 people. By 1890 the population was recorded as being 750 and only four years later it had increased to 1200.

On March 4, 2015, the Ferguson Police Department was criticized by the United States Department of Justice for civil rights violations. The Department of Justice argued that the Ferguson Police Department and the City of Ferguson relied on unconstitutional practices in order to balance the city&#x27;s budget through racially motivated excessive fines and punishments.

On March 11, 2015, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson stated he was willing to resign, likely later that day (though no timeframe was confirmed) if he could get assurances that the Ferguson Police Department would be left in place and would not be dissolved; Fox News said he was not pushed out or fired. His resignation followed City Manager John Shaw who resigned March 10, and Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer, who resigned March 9. Shaw had ultimate oversight over the Police Department and other city departments and was the most powerful civic official in Ferguson. He faced criticism for not doing enough to ameliorate the situation. The week before, three Ferguson Police Department employees were fired for offensive emails mentioned in the Justice Department report.

==Michael Brown shooting==
On August 9, 2014, an 18-year-old man, Michael Brown, was fatally shot by Darren Wilson with the Ferguson Police Department after an encounter with the officer that led to an altercation and subsequent pursuit. The incident sparked riots and acts of vandalism in Ferguson as well as widespread calls for an investigation into the incident. On August 10, after a day of vigils, there were looting of businesses, arson, vandalism of vehicles, shots fired at firemen and violent clashes between rioters and police. On August 18, reservists from the Missouri National Guard arrived in Ferguson at the request of the Governor of Missouri Jay Nixon, who also ended midnight to 5:00 a.m. curfews that had been imposed. On November 24, a grand jury decided that it would not indict Wilson in the shooting death of Brown. Following the announcement of the grand jury&#x27;s decision, there was more rioting.

<text>Florissant () is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, within Greater St. Louis. It is a middle-class, second-ring northern suburb of St. Louis. Based on the 2020 United States census, the city had a total population of 52,533. It is the largest city in St. Louis County.

==History==
The exact date the first settlers went to the Valley of Florissant is unknown, but it is one of the oldest settlements in Missouri. Some historians believe it was settled about the same time as St. Louis. The first civilian government was formed in 1786. Spanish archives in Havana reveal 40 people and seven plantations were in Florissant at the time of the 1787 census. The village, called &quot;Fleurissant&quot;, meaning &quot;Blooming&quot; in English, by its French settlers and &quot;St. Ferdinand&quot; by its Spanish rulers, was a typical French village with its commons and common fields. Originally a separate town, and now an inner suburb of St. Louis, the community was centered on (and frequently called after) the parish of St. Ferdinand. The center of the parish, the Old St. Ferdinand Shrine, survives and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Around 1809, the Cold Water Cemetery had the first burial; since 2004, it has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its social history.

As late as 1889, the town was predominantly French-speaking (while the southern portion of the metropolis was populated by German speakers). The first train line to the area was constructed in 1878—an extension of the line which went from St. Louis City to Normandy. The last train to Florissant ran on November 14, 1931.

Following World War II, Florissant went from a small village community to a large suburban center, as developers such as Alfred H. Mayer Co. began building subdivisions on what was formerly farmland and empty acreage. Around 18,000 houses were built between 1947 and 1980, and the population swelled to its peak of about 76,000 in the mid-1970s, making it the largest city in St. Louis County.

James J. Eagan was the first mayor of Florissant after a charter amendment created the position. He ultimately served 37 years from 1963 until his death on November 2, 2000, being re-elected into office nine times, and became one of the longest-serving mayors of any city in the United States. In his final year, he was awarded the title of Best Politician in St. Louis by the &quot;Riverfront Times&quot;. The civic center off Parker Road is named the James J. Eagan Community Center in his memory.

In 2012, Florissant was ranked 76 in &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s top-100 list of Best Places to Live – America&#x27;s Best Small Cities. In 2014, Florissant ranked as the #1 Best Small City to Retire To in America and the second-safest city in Missouri.
Florissant Old Town Historic District is a locally designated historic preservation planning district, created by local ordinance in 1969. Within that, the heart of Old Town Florissant is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the St. Ferdinand Central Historic District. The boundaries of the district are roughly rue St. Francois, rue St. Ferdinand, and rue St. Denis, and Lafayette Street. The City of St. Ferdinand Multiple Resource Area (MRA), located in the oldest section of the present city of Florissant, encompasses approximately 156 city blocks and encloses the approximate area of the City of St. Ferdinand, as Florissant was known from 1857 to 1939. This MRA comprises 124 historically significant properties ranging in date from 1790 to 1940. The historic Old St. Ferdinand Shrine is located on the western end of Old Town. The Shrine and Historic Site consists of four historic buildings on their original locations: the 1819 convent, 1821 church, 1840 rectory, and 1888 schoolhouse. It is listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places and is a U.S. Historic District.

Historic Florissant, the local historical society, operates out of the preserved Gittemeier House.

<doc id="123200" wikidata="Q958579" url="?curid=123200" title="Kinloch, Missouri">
<text>Kinloch is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri. The population was 263 as of the 2020 census.

The oldest African-American community to be incorporated in Missouri, Kinloch was home to a vibrant and flourishing black community for much of the 19th and 20th century. It began to decline in the 1980s, when St. Louis began to buy up property due to an FAA noise-abatement program for nearby St. Louis Lambert International Airport. Between 1990 and 2000, Kinloch lost more than 80 percent of its population, and the city became an increasingly violent and dangerous place to live. In recent years, there have been efforts to rebuild the city.

==History==
The current city of Kinloch grew up around Kinloch Park, a commuter suburb first developed in the 1890s.

A Mrs. &quot;B&quot; and her husband are thought to be the first black family to purchase a home in Kinloch Park. As soon as the neighbors discovered the new owners were black they sold their properties, and new sales to permanent white residents of south Kinloch Park ceased. In a few years, more than 30 black families had bought into a six-block area that became called South Kinloch Park.

Kinloch, as an African-American community, developed out of a land purchase model similar to the Brooklyn, Illinois model. Since it was not legal to sell directly to blacks, the Olive Street Terrace Realty Corporation sold the parcels to whites for an average price of $150. The new owners then sold the plots to blacks for an average of $350. This allowed the company to use the white people&#x27;s loans as collateral for further bank notes. To get white investors, the company circulated testimonials of investors who paid in $50 towards a parcel and received returns of $500 to $1,000 on the investment. In an advertisement to the &quot;Argus&quot;, Olive Street Terrace Realty said, &quot;The good colored people of South Kinloch Park have built themselves a little city of which they have a right to be proud. More than a hundred homes, three churches and a splendid public school have been built in a few years.&quot;

The Kinloch Park development had a horse-racing facility called Kinloch Track. When Missouri outlawed the sport, the grounds were taken over by Kinloch Airfield, which saw some historic flights. The Aero Club of St. Louis hosted the first international air meet in October 1910, where Theodore Roosevelt became the first U.S. president to fly in an airplane. Pilot Arch Hoxsey flew the president around for over three minutes in a Wright Brothers plane they had brought in.

The Kinloch Airfield saw the first control tower, the first meal served on a flight, the first airmail shipped, the first parachute jump, the first aerial photo and the first animal airlifted. Albert Bond Lambert, the first person in the St. Louis area to receive a pilot&#x27;s license, and fellow members of the Aero Club leased the field in 1920 and renamed it the Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field in 1923. Two years later, Lambert purchased the field outright; on February 7, 1928, he sold it to the city of St. Louis at cost, allowing it to become the first city-operated airport and the precursor of today&#x27;s Lambert-St. Louis International Airport.

Kinloch was home to the 198th chapter of the Universal Negro Improvement Association UNIA, which fostered black-owned businesses in the area. The chapter chairman was Elijah Woodson.

In 1902, the white residents of Kinloch Park decided to withdraw from the neighboring Ferguson school district and built the Nuroad school for whites. Their two-room school was given to black students, who were using the 1885 Vernon schoolhouse built for the children of the servants to the whites in Kinloch. In 1913, the Dunbar Elementary school, named after Paul Laurence Dunbar, was established for the black children of South Kinloch. Still segregated when it closed in 1975, it holds the record as the longest-operated school for blacks only.

In 1924, Kinloch became the first community in Missouri to elect a black man to its school board: the Reverend Walter Johnson, who later became a vocal critic of Kinloch&#x27;s refusal to build a high school for its black students.

Another Vernon School opened in 1927 to educate the black students of Kinloch and west Ferguson. Although the U.S. Supreme Court had ordered desegregation in 1954, the school remained segregated until it closed in 1967. Even though the Kinloch schools remained segregated, the Kinloch students took part in a court-ordered busing program to desegregate other school districts.

In 1931, Holy Angels Parish was established and opened Our Lady of the Angels Elementary School. A new, updated church was built in 1952. Both the church and school were open until 2002, making it the oldest continuing black parish in the St. Louis Archdiocese.

In 1938, South Kinloch was poised to elect a second black board member, with a district that was 543 black students to 349 whites. This was when the white north put on the ballot an attempt to split the school district. This third attempt to divide the district by the protesting and minority whites who attended Nuroad School ended in failure, with 415 unanimous votes against in the black south and 215 unanimous votes for in the white north. This led to the foundation of a new municipality called Berkeley, which included all of North Kinloch Park plus land to the northwest and which formed a new school district. South Kinloch Park became Kinloch.

One all-but-forgotten element in Kinloch&#x27;s success was the electric streetcar line which ran through it to Florissant. Later the line was cut back to just north of Airport Road in Berkeley. At Kinloch, near the beginning of the 1900s, a branch had been constructed to downtown Ferguson, connecting at what was known as various times as Ramona Junction and Ferguson Junction. This clean, economic and efficient transportation gave Kinloch residents the ability to travel with ease to jobs both in the City of St. Louis and the northwestern suburbs. At the Wellston Loop, the line connected with numerous other streetcar and bus lines, giving Kinloch residents a reliable way to get to downtown St. Louis and the suburbs of University City, Clayton, Brentwood, Kirkwood, and Webster Groves–as well as communities along St. Charles Rock Road west to St. Charles. Many white people became acquainted with Kinloch as they passed through the area on their streetcar journeys. The substation at the junction of the Berkeley and Ferguson branches still sits on the east side of Hanley Road opposite Suburban Avenue, which had been the streetcar right-of-way into Ferguson. In a heavy segregated culture, black and white rode the streetcars as equals. Anyone could sit wherever anyone wanted and it was not unusual for blacks and whites who otherwise would never have known each other to strike up conversations. In summer streetcar riders always commented on the tantalizing smoky breeze of barbecuing at the Kinloch stop, where the trolleys to Ferguson paused on a graceful, wide curve.

===Decline and revitalization efforts===

In the 1980s, the City of St. Louis began to buy out property in Kinloch as part of a noise-abatement program for Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. Eventually, the airport took the vast majority of private homes in Kinloch. Between 1990 and 2000, Kinloch lost more than 75 percent of its population. The social and economic effects of this buyout were disastrous for the community.

Kinloch became an increasingly violent and dangerous place to live, infested with drugs and crime. The police department faced numerous investigations, and over a 20-year period a number of officers were arrested on corruption charges. In September 2002, St. Louis County police chief Ron Battelle directed his department to take control of law enforcement in Kinloch. The city&#x27;s population had dwindled to 449, and there was talk of disincorporation, which was renewed in 2011, when Mayor Keith Conway faced federal charges for using city funds to pay for personal expenses, including a vacation home in Florida.

In recent years, there have been efforts to rebuild the city. Faith Beyond Walls, a community service organization, has been instrumental in mobilizing volunteers to assist with these efforts.

The City of St. Louis, St. Louis County, Kinloch, Berkeley and Ferguson reached agreement on a redevelopment plan for of land on the northeast corner of I-70 and I-170, along the eastern edge of the airport. Years ago, this land was part of the airport buyout. The redevelopment will offer office, retail, and industrial space and is expected to create about 12,000 jobs, along with tax revenue to be split among the municipalities. The developers, NorthPark Partners, intend to make improvements in Kinloch and donate a new civic center to Kinloch.

===2015 election rejection===
On April 23, 2015, newly elected mayor Betty McCray was refused entrance to City Hall on the first day of her term. Members of the previous administration claimed voter fraud and that she had been suspended according to the city attorney. Eventually she was allegedly served with impeachment papers. The impeachment hearing was canceled in June 2015, leading McCray to file suit in St. Louis County Circuit Court, asking Judge John D.

Plans for a new community close to St. Louis were begun after the St. Louis fire of 1849 and the preceding and subsequent cholera outbreaks that killed one-tenth of the residents of downtown St. Louis.

Kirkwood was the first suburban municipality built outside of the St. Louis city boundaries.

When the railroad reached the community in 1853, the developers sold lots for the Kirkwood Association. Other Leffingwell developments were to include the construction of Grand Avenue and the establishment of Forest Park. In 1866, the Quinette Cemetery was built, which is one of the five historic African American burial grounds in the St. Louis area.

==History==
The historical anecdotes contained in this section were derived from the 2011 book &quot;Ladue Found&quot;, written by Charlene Bry, former editor and owner of &quot;The Ladue News.&quot;

Ladue began as a farming community St. Louis County suburb. After St. Louis City ejected St. Louis County in 1876, Ladue was known as ranges 4 and 5 of &quot;Township 45&quot;, with Clayton being the political hub. Original Township 45 farming families included the Dennys, Dwyers, Conways, McCutcheons, McKnights (all Irish), Litzsinger, von Schraders, Spoedes, Luedloffs, Muellers, Seigers (all German), LaDues (French), Warsons, Lays, Barnes, Prices, and Watsons (all English), according to a 1868 Pitzman map of St. Louis, as well as 1878 and 1909 maps of St. Louis County.

Once automobiles replaced horse and wagon as the primary mode of transportation, farmers in the area began selling portions of their land to city workers who wished to live outside of the urban setting. Three small villages (Village of LaDue, Village of Deer Creek, and the Village of McKnight) merged in 1936 to become what is now known as Ladue. Ladue was named from Ladue Road, the main thoroughfare in the area that led from St. Louis city to wealthy entrepreneur Peter Albert LaDue&#x27;s large property at the current intersection of Warson Road and Ladue Road (including St. Louis Country Club). Peter Albert LaDue was born in Kinderhook, New York, in 1821, a descendant of Pierre LaDoux, who arrived from France in the 1600s. He arrived in Saint Louis about 1848 and later became a prominent attorney, alderman, and banker and land speculator.

==Controversies==
In the early 1990s, the city tried to force a resident to take down a yard sign that said &quot;Say No to the War in the Persian Gulf, Call Congress Now&quot; as it violated a city law. The ACLU sued, arguing that the right to place the sign was protected by the right to free speech enshrined in the 1st Amendment. The ensuing legal battle went to the United States Supreme Court which unanimously ruled, in &quot;City of Ladue v. Gilleo&quot;, that the right to place the sign was protected by the Constitution.

In 1986, the City of Ladue sued residents E. Terrence Jones and Joan Kelly Horn for living together without being married. Ladue officials had ordered them to marry or leave their home. The Missouri Court of Appeals sided with the city, stating in &quot;City of Ladue v. Horn&quot; that &quot;A man and woman living together, sharing pleasures and certain responsibilities, does not per se constitute a family in even the conceptual sense. [...] There is no doubt that there is a governmental interest in marriage and in preserving the integrity of the biological or legal family. There is no concomitant governmental interest in keeping together a group of unrelated persons, no matter how closely they simulate a family. Further, there is no state policy which commands that groups of people may live under the same roof in any section of a municipality they choose.&quot; Under Chapter 213 of the Missouri Human Rights Act (§213.040.1), passed after the &quot;Ladue v. Horn&quot; case, housing discrimination on the basis of familial status is now illegal.

In 2010, the former chief of police, Larry White, sued the City of Ladue for wrongful termination. The suit was dismissed by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County in 2012 and the dismissal upheld by the Missouri Court of Appeals in 2013.

Despite comprising only 0.88% of the local population, black drivers in Ladue comprised 575 (of 4107 total, or 14%) stops in 2014. The resulting &quot;disparity index&quot; indicates a black driver was 15.98 times more likely than the average driver to be stopped by the Ladue Police Department in 2014, but the police department contends the statistics are skewed by the local racial composition.

<text>Maplewood is an inner-ring suburb of St. Louis, located in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States.

==History==
Maplewood was established around the turn of the 20th century. Maplewood was one of the early suburbs of St. Louis. Located just outside the city limits, Maplewood was located at the end of one of St. Louis&#x27;s streetcar lines and was also located near major railroads.

It was built as a bedroom community. Advertising suggested that people should get away from the city (in an era of common and sooty commercial, industrial, and domestic coal burning) and enjoy the fresh air of less densely populated areas like Maplewood. Maplewood&#x27;s historic residential areas were mostly built from 1900 to 1910 and a number of well-preserved homes remain. Several of these homes have remained in the same family for generations.

Maplewood is currently being revitalized by an influx of restaurants, businesses, and shops around Manchester Ave., Sutton Ave., and the Greenwood Historic District.

Up until 2018, under a local nuisance ordinance, a person who called the police for domestic violence more than twice in 180 days could face eviction. In 2012, a woman was evicted from her home after she had called the police four times to request protection from physical assaults by her ex-boyfriend. She became homeless in the process. In 2017, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of the victim, claiming that the Maplewood nuisance ordinance violated the First Amendment right to petition the government for assistance, as well as the rights to travel, equal protection and due process. In 2018, the ordinance was revised to eliminate language that allowed officials to fine or evict people who were victims of crime. 

In 2021, residents of Maplewood elected Nikylan Knapper as the city&#x27;s first black mayor.

<text>Normandy is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 4,287 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The city of Normandy is on land once owned by Charles Lucas. Lucas obtained property from the federal government with land grants, and he purchased the land from victims of the New Madrid earthquake of 1811. He named it for the French coastal region of Normandy from which his father John Baptiste Charles Lucas came. The site of his home is now on the property of Incarnate Word Academy.

Lucas was to fight two duels on Bloody Island with Thomas Hart Benton, and died in the 1817 duel.

Upon Charles&#x27; death, and that of his father, Federal Land Grant Judge J.B.C. Lucas, his land was left to his sister Anne and brother James. Anne married Capt. Theodore Hunt, son of the Patriot Abraham Hunt of Trenton, New Jersey, who died in 1832. In 1836, she married Theodore&#x27;s first cousin, the explorer Wilson Price Hunt. The Hunt home at 7717 Natural Bridge Rd. was completed in 1908 after the current site of Glen Echo Club (the old Hunt Estate) was leased to the Golf Club in 1898 and later sold to the club. It was used for several years as the convent of the Sisters of the Cenacle before being taken over by the Normandy School District.

Normandy incorporated in May 1945.

In 1960, the Normandy School District approved a bond issue to buy the Bellerive Country Club to form a junior college. In 1963, the Normandy Residence Center became the University of Missouri–St. Louis; the university is partially within the City of Normandy.

In May 1977, Normandy annexed Berdell Hills.

<text>Olivette is an inner-ring suburb of St. Louis, located in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 8,504 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Olivette was settled in the mid-19th century as a small farming community along an old Indian trail originally called the Bonhomme Road (now known as Old Bonhomme, which meets and essentially turns into Olive Boulevard). Olive Road is a ridge road and at one time served as a de facto boundary for housing segregation in outer St. Louis.

The first brick schoolhouse in St. Louis County was built in the 1850s at the corner of Price and Old Bonhomme in Olivette. Logos High School is built on the former grounds of the schoolhouse.

In the 1920s, St. Louis decided to build a water reservoir in Olivette since it was one of the highest points in St. Louis County. The reservoir was built at Brock&#x27;s Pond, a local recreational spot, and finished in 1926. Stacy Park was formed around the reservoir and is now the largest park in Olivette.

Olivette was incorporated in 1930 by combining the communities of Central, Tower Hill, Olive, and Stratmann. Prior to merging, the area was known as Central due to its centralized location along the Central Plank Road (again, now called Olive Boulevard). In fact, Price Road and Olive Boulevard intersect at the exact midpoint between the Port of St. Louis on the Mississippi River and Howell&#x27;s Landing on the Missouri River. Central was a high traffic stop for wagons to restock on their journey between the two stops. O.

Olivette is one of the few communities in St. Louis County that maintains their own municipal fire department and police department.

<text>Overland is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 15,955 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area south of the King&#x27;s Road to St. Charles was first settled in the early 1820s, when travelers westward from St. Louis would stop overnight at what became known as &quot;The Overland Park&quot;. Daniel Boone constructed a single room cabin here, near the current location of Lake Sherwood and Wyland Elementary School.

In time, businesses were established and a one-room subscription school, the Buck School, was built in 1846. In 1867, the Ritenour School District was organized. In 1919, the town&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;Overland&quot;, to avoid postal confusion with the city of Overland Park, Kansas.

The town was incorporated as a fourth class city in 1939 with a mayoral-city council government. In the 1990s, the city voters approved a change to a third class city. In 2007, the city voted to move to a mayor-council-administrator form of government. Under this structure, the mayor serves as the chief elected official. The city council serves as the legislative body, and is empowered to pass ordinances and resolutions it deems necessary to the operation of the city. The city administrator is a full-time employee of the city, and executes the day-to-day tasks of operations.

The 1.6-million-square foot six-story Military Personnel Records Center, built in 1956 for the United States Department of Defense, later became part of the National Archives and Records Service in the General Services Administration. On July 12, 1973, a huge fire destroyed an estimated 16 to 18 million personnel files, mostly for the 50 years prior to 1963. The incident was believed to be the largest single loss of government records in the country&#x27;s history.

On April 3, 2007, Overland residents voted to recall Mayor Ann Purzner, who had been accused of lying about her career credentials and exceeding her power as mayor. She was temporarily replaced by Alderman Jerry May, and in the August 2007 election, Councilman Mike Schneider was elected mayor.

<text>Pagedale is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,554 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The area originally was farmland, but it did have an interesting history with several pockets of significant Greek and African-American residents. Because St. Vincent&#x27;s mental hospital was located just north of St. Charles Rock Road, a streetcar line was constructed in the late 1800s from just south of Olive Street Road in University City north on the east side of Ferguson Avenue through what is now Pagedale to meet the electric interurban line to Saint Charles at the Rock Road. The south end of the line eventually joined with the Creve Coeur Lake streetcar line which ran on Vernon Avenue (but later was relocated a block further south to run behind a new subdivision). That transportation opened up the area to housing.

South of Pagedale, at Page and Ferguson, was Hazel Hill, which eventually became the reason for the Lincoln School which became part of the Normandy School District. Though long forgotten as a name, the Hazel Hill community still exists and the Lincoln building is still standing. When Pagedale was incorporated, the northern end went beyond the Rock Road up Hoke Avenue, which later was renamed Ferguson though it didn&#x27;t line up with Ferguson. In 1954 a new housing subdivision was built at Ferguson and North Market Street. That subdivision, named Engelholm Gardens, a long forgotten name also, still stands, looking exactly as it did in 1954.

In 2001, a new $1 million Pagedale City Hall and Police Facility was built. It included an 8,000-square-foot space to house a local court facility.

In November 2015, some residents filed a civil rights class action lawsuit against the city of Pagedale for overly aggressive ticketing of residential code enforcement as a &quot;revenue generating machine&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch ran a series of articles covering St. Louis County and Pagedale and the substantial increase in city revenue from non-traffic violations. According to the 2015 city code in Pagedale, the residents were not allowed to have &quot;a basketball hoop, volleyball net, swimming or wading pool or other recreational equipment shall be utilized on or permitted on any portion of residential property in front of the front line of any dwelling&quot;.
Other infractions of the code include having hedges over three feet in the front yard, having any antenna dish device in the front of the yard, any front street facing window or doors shall have proper treatments in a neat presentable matter, and if a person in the city has their pants low enough to show his skin or underwear, the person can receive a fine up to $100.

On November 4, 2015 Institute for Justice filed a class action civil rights complaint against the city on behalf of three Pagedale residents. The complaint claimed residents of Pagedale were stripped of their rights to due process. It also sought an injunction against the city non-traffic fines.

On May 18, 2018, the city settled and agreed to stop its practice of earning money from ticketing residents for minor crimes.

Pine Lawn police issued some 17,000 traffic violations during 2014, in a town with about 2,300 adults, and has about 30,000 open warrants. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, Pine Lawn collected general revenue in the amount of $3,532,167, out of which $2,237,196 derived from fine and fees from its municipal court. This amounts to 63% of its general revenue and based on the 2010 Census, equates to $683.11 for each of its 3,275 residents. The local prosecutor was criticized for this, because he is a lawyer for the Michael Brown family, and alleges overzealous enforcement by the Ferguson Police Department.

The report of the US Attorney General concerning the Ferguson Police Department prompted protests in Pine Lawn, Missouri as well. The use of police departments as revenue generation units may be widespread.

In October 2016, a former Pine Lawn police lieutenant, Steve Blakeney, was sentenced to 51 months in prison after being convicted of trumping up charges to arrest a challenger to then incumbent mayor Sylvester Caldwell. The officer coerced two store owners to falsely testify that the candidate had stolen a Caldwell campaign poster, then used that testimony In December 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the conviction. Caldwell was himself convicted and sentenced to prison for extortion in 2015.

<text>Rock Hill is a suburban town in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 4,635 at the 2010 census. It is home to the Fairfax House on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Rock Hill is bounded by cities Ladue, Brentwood, Webster Groves, Glendale and Warson Woods.

;Streets
Manchester Road is four lanes and runs east–west across Rock Hill. North Rock Hill Road was connected to the South McKnight Road extension in June 1962. Voters passed a $3 million bond issue to repair roads in 2000. By 2005 the fund was nearly depleted with considerable work left to be done. Voters passed a proposition in 2011 to extend the street bond issue, allowing the city to raise an additional $3.5 million.

In October 2019, the board of aldermen voted to lower the speed limit on most streets to 20 miles per hour.

== History ==
James Collier Marshall settled what became Rock Hill around 1832. He and his brother John Marshall purchased 800 acres along Manchester Road where he and his brother built a log building that operated as a home and store.
In 1839 James built a two-story weatherboard home, naming it &quot;Fairfax&quot; after a family friend in Maryland, Albert Kirby Fairfax, Lord Fairfax of Cameron. A year later the property was divided between James and John Marshall when James married Elizabeth Kyle McCausland (she is related to The Robert Campbell Family of St Louis thru the Kyle&#x27;s). Fairfax was completed the following year. James and Elizabeth had five children who lived to maturity. A son, Ernest, the only to marry and have children, raised two sons.

James Marshall sought to build a church and requested the services of the Presbyterian Church of St. Louis, which sent Rev Artemus Bullard to assist Marshall in 1845. A Presbyterian congregation was established in Rock Hill in March 1845, and met in a log house on Marshall&#x27;s property while the church was built on land contributed by Marshall for a church. Though there is no written proof, it is assumed by many that slaves built the church using stone quarried from the Marshall farm quarry. Rev. Bullard gave the church the name &quot;Rock Hill Presbyterian Church,&quot; presumably after two geographic features in the area, which became the namesake of the area. In 1866 fifteen members separated to found the Webster Groves Presbyterian Church

Marshall served as first postmaster at Fairfax House c. 1845. Marshall died in February 1864. The post office was closed in 1863, only to reopen a year later until 1897, whereupon mail service was moved to Webster Groves.

Mail service was re-established in February 1874.

Rock Hill was a stop near present-day Creve Coeur Drive on the Missouri Pacific spur from Creve Coeur, Missouri to downtown St. Louis. Trains ran twice daily. In 1934 Rock Hill Investment Co. purchased 22.93 acres on the railroad from Rock Hill Supply Co. for an industrial subdivision In 1954 Walter F. Hellmich purchased 15 acres to develop an &quot;Industrial Court.&quot; In 1969 Rock Hill notified Missouri Pacific it would condemn its station.

Rock Hill remained largely undeveloped until the 1920s when much of the area was parceled for the construction of houses. In 1940 a 27-acre subdivision was created south of Manchester road. In April 1929 Rock Hill was incorporated as a village. The village switched to a mayor–aldermanic form of government in 1941. In April 1947 the Village of Rock Hill voted to incorporate as a fourth class city.

On 10 February 1959 a powerful tornado struck Rock Hill north of Manchester, destroying Mackle Florist (1913–1965) and continued onward into St. Louis.

In April 1962 the city voted to annex the eastern half of Des Peres Avenue.

The city flag was presented by the Citizens of Rock Hill Improvement Association in May 1965.

In 2006 Rock Hill began transitioning from a residential city to a point-of-sale city with a retail development project on Manchester. With city financial reserves at critical levels, city administrator George Liyeos told the &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot; &quot;our entire future hinges on the success of that project.&quot;

The 30th annual Rock Hill Fall Festival was held in 2013.

== Business ==
In business since 1890, Trainwreck Saloon on Manchester is the oldest continually operated bar in St. Louis County.

Business first developed east of Deer Creek. Windom was the Rock Hill area serviced by railroad east of the river bounded by Brentwood Boulevard and Litzinger Road. Windom stop, later &quot;Mentor&quot;, had a post office where mail was delivered weekly. West of Deer Creek a number of dairy and produce farms developed.

The Hacienda restaurant building on Manchester Road was the home built by steamboat captain Mils T. Redmon in 1861. In 1951 the house became a restaurant called Chalet De Normandie, owned by the Ledait family, and later Parente&#x27;s Italian Village. In 1968, it was St. Louis&#x27; first full-service Mexican eatery. It was called Oliver&#x27;s until 1977, when it became Hacienda.

In July 1997 Landside Resources Inc. began constructing McKnight Crossing, a $5.5 million 40,000-square-foot mixed-use space anchored by Hollywood Video. In April Landside had agreed to purchase the Fairfax House from the Rock Hill Improvement Association and pay for its restoration and relocation across the road to Rock Hill Presbyterian Church.

In May 1999 the Board of Alderman selected Sansone Development over Landside Resources for redevelopment of McKnight and Manchester. In October Sansone withdrew from the project. Sansone told Rock Hill later that year it wanted to scale back the development area from 25 acres to 16, just the northwest corner. After the city reopening the bid process Rock Hill agreed in April 2000 to allow Sansone to develop 16 acres, financed by up to $7 million in tax-increment financing. Sansone withdrew its proposal again in September 2000 citing city delays that meant surrounding development projects had progressed so much as to make the 16-acre proposal infeasible. The city re-bid the projects and received 40-acre plans from Regency Realty and THF Realty and an additional 25-acre plan from Regency. In April 2001 both developers retracted their bids amid a firestorm of resident opposition against the proposals.

In 2001 RSI Kitchen &amp; Bath purchased the three-acre former Stivers car dealership property on Manchester for construction of its main showroom.
In December 2000 Quebecor World began talks with city officials to acquire the city hall for a potential expansion of the adjacent Sayers Printing Company. In August 2002 Quebecor World Sayers closed its 3.5-acre property.

In January 2004 the Board of Aldermen selected Novus Companies to develop 36.9 acres at the southwest and northwest corners of Manchester and McKnight roads. In March 2005 the Board of Aldermen approved the $95 million mixed-use development, called Market at McKnight. The buy-out area targeted 126 properties on the north corner, and 48 properties, including 15 homes, on the south side. Demolition began in August 2006. In May 2007 Rock Hill sought a second request for proposals when over half of north-side property owners were unsatisfied with Novus&#x27; buy-out offers and Novus sought an additional $7 million in tax increment financing (TIF). In December 2007 the Board of Alderman replaced Novus with Miller Weingarten and Hutkin Properties on the northwest redevelopment site and increased the TIF from $18 million to $26.7 million. The south Market at McKnight opened in November 2007. By January 2010 the development area was 60 percent leased. In April 2014 Novus announced its second anchor for the development, 27,000-square-foot Lucky&#x27;s Market.

In June 2005 the Board of Aldermen approved Mills Properties&#x27; request to build an 84-unit apartment complex on 7.7 acres on McKnight Road.

In 2006 Rock Hill joined the Webster Groves/Shrewsberry Area Chamber of Commerce.

In December 2008 Target delayed its plans for a store on the northwest development by nine months, citing the global credit crisis. In March 2009 Target canceled its planned location. Miller Weingarten ended its involvement in May. The 27-acre north development area was reduced to 2.9 acres in October 2010.

In 1986 The Book House was established on Manchester Road. In 2009 the three-story Victorian house received a Historic Buildings designation from the Rock Hill Historic Preservation Commission. In May 2013 Book House owner Michelle Barron received an eviction notice from property owner Rex Stahl who wanted to redevelop the 1.5-acre property, site of two other businesses. In October the Board of Alderman approved EZ Storage&#x27;s proposal to build a 107,772-square-foot storage facility on the site. The Book House reopened in Maplewood in 2014.

== Education ==
Since 1948 Rock Hill has been part of the Webster Groves School District. Three public schools are within the city&#x27;s borders:
*Hudson Elementary School
* Givens Elementary School (formerly Steger Sixth Grade Center and Computer School) 

Rock Hill School District comprised Rock Hill, parts of Ladue, Warson Woods, Kirkwood, Brentwood and Webster Groves; and was one of the first districts formed in St. Louis County. Rock Hill #I on Manchester and Rock Hill Road was established in 1909. In 1911 enrollment was 270. In 1912 two more elementary schools were built. In 1920 Rock Hill #II passed on to Brentwood when the city split from Rock Hill School District to form its own school district. Rock Hill #I was expanded with a three-story addition in 1930, the same year Rock Hill #III was razed. In 1945 ten acres were purchased for construction of a junior high school, later also a senior high school, which is today Hudson Elementary School. It was designed by Ernest J. Friton. In July 1948, voters opted to merge the district with Webster Groves School District. The Webster Groves School Board accepted the merge in September. Enrollment in Rock Hill School District was 435 at the time. Rock Hill superintendent T. Dean Adams was named as principal of Rock Hill&#x27;s two schools. Rock Hill #I was renamed after long-time Rock Hill school board president Ed Schall. The NAACP sued and won the right for students on the north side of Lithia Avenue to attend Schall after schools were legally integrated in 1956.

In May 1958, Webster Groves School District voters passed a bond issue for the construction of a $1.6 million junior high school in Rock Hill and a second junior high school abutting Webster Groves Senior High School. Steger Junior High, named after Webster Groves Superintendent Leonard Steger, was built in 1960. Steger was converted to an elementary school amid budget cuts in 1978 as part of a district-wide reorganization plan. In 1983 the school district finalized plans to consolidate sixth grade teaching at Steger.

Schall School was rebuilt in 1965, then transferred to Special School District of St. Louis County in 1975. Enrollment was 172. Hudson was closed in 1978 and reopened in 1984 after remodeling. Schall was made a Department of Motor Vehicles office circa 1982.

;Rock Hill Preschool
From c. 1974 Rock Hill Preschool operated out of the Parks and Recreation building on North Rock Hill Road.
In March 2007 the city eliminated the preschool program as a cost-saving measure. Mayor Morgan voted against the preschool the next month when a second aldermanic vote came down to a tie.

==Parks, recreation and historical landmarks ==
The recreation program was set in motion in 1971 by mayor Lincoln Wagner. In June 1972 mayor Jess Stroup created a citizen parks and recreation commission to build a city park. One of the recreation commission&#x27;s first acts was to create a summer day camp program for children. By October 1974 the city signed a contract to begin construction of a half-acre park. Dedicated in June 1975, the two-acre park had two tennis courts, two handball courts, two shuffleboard courts and horseshoe pits. In 1976 the city hired Genie Zakrzewski to direct the parks and recreation program. By June 1982, the city had added four more parks:

*Oakhaven Park – Three-acre park on Gilbert &amp; Oakhaven completed in 1977. Two lots for the park were purchased in 1974 and 1975. Built with four tennis courts, a picnic shelter, horseshoe pits and a playground.
*Oak Trail Nature Park – Four-acre park at the end of Oakhaven with 2000 feet of trails. Developed in 1979.
*Stroup Field – On Old Warson and McKinley. The land for this two-and-a-half-acre park was purchased around 1978. It initially included two softball fields and a soccer/football field.
*Greenwood Park – Located between Lithia and Eldridge. Sub-acre park that initially included a basketball court and playground.

The five parks cost $325,000 to build, with three quarters of the amount coming from federal and state programs.

After the Rock Hill Parks and Recreation building was demolished, the tennis courts at Rock Hill park remained until the park was closed and dismantled in 2017.

Two additional parks have also been built:
* Hensley Park – Next to Salem Hills
* Whitfield Park – Berry Road &amp; Madison Avenue

Over half of residents had visited a city park in that last year, according to a 2009 survey commissioned by the city. Seventy-six percent of respondents felt the parks needed improvements. Oakhaven Park was the most used, followed by Stroup Field.

The Rock Hill Presbyterian Church was built by slaves in 1847 at what is now Manchester and McKnight roads. It was the oldest operating Presbyterian church west of the Mississippi River until 2010 when its congregation left. The United African Presbyterian Church congregation occupied the building until 2011 when the Giddings-Lovejoy Presbytery sold the property to a gas station. In July 2011 the Board of Aldermen approved construction under the condition that the gas station owners attempt to rehome the church. In April 2012 Cedar Lake Cellars began moving the church at its own expense to its winery in Foristell, Missouri.

Three time capsules were buried on the church property between 1845 and 1958. The later two (from 1935 and 1958) were recovered and opened in May. The third, its location having never been recorded, was never found.

==Government==
Since 2003 the city administrator is no longer required to live in Rock Hill. Larry Hensley served as city administrator from 1983 to September 2002. George Liyeos served as city administrator from September 2005 until his resignation in May 2014. The Board of Aldermen appointed Jennifer Yackley as City Administrator in July.

;City center
In 1940 voters passed a $11,000 bond issue to build a city hall and fire department headquarters. The project also received a federal grant. The city hall on Rock Hill Road was dedicated in December 1941.

In 1958 the city purchased the Koehler property on Manchester Road for the construction of a new city hall. The city hall housing police, fire station and Rock Hill Library was dedicated in May 1965.

By 1996 the city said city hall was overcrowded and planned to relocate to Stroup Field, on the southeast corner of McKinley Avenue and Old Warson Road. Later that year, however, voters defeated a parks and drainage sales tax intended to help finance the move.

Rock Hill then proposed remodeling city hall. By September 1999 proposed remodeling costs grew from $1.15 million to nearly $1.68 million.

City hall expansion plans were suspended in December 2000 when Quebecor World began talks with city officials to acquire the city hall property for a potential expansion of Sayers Printing Company. Talks soon fell apart and in April the city resumed planning for an expanded city center. In August 2002 Quebecor World Sayers closed its 3.5-acre property.

Sayers&#x27; property was one of three options being considered for city hall&#x27;s expansion in October 2002. In December Gerber selected the former Gerber site on McKnight Road for the $5.2 million project. In November 2003 the Board of Aldermen purchased the former Gerber property on McKnight Road for $1.75 million. The city planned to build a $13 million, 83,000 square-foot city center complete with an indoor pool, library, full gymnasium, and banquet facility that doubled as meeting space.

In May 2004 Rock Hill Chief Financial Officer Don Cary said overspending put the city on track for bankruptcy by 2010. In June 2004 Mayor Robert Salamone abruptly announced his resignation effective in August, citing &quot;individuals who seek to impede or even halt our efforts at improving our city.&quot; In October 2004 the city scaled back its plans for the McKnight site to administrative offices and a police station. The city sold the site to Mills Properties for $1.950 million in February 2005. A state audit in September 2005 said the city lost some $700,000 on the property.

City Hall moved into temporary retail space on Manchester in August 2005, then anticipated to be a temporary move lasting less than two years. In September it sold its former city hall to Novice Companies for $3.67 million. Also that year Rock Hill purchased five homes on North Rock Hill Road for construction of a permanent city hall. However, in March 2006 the city suspended its plans when it determined it was well short of the funds necessary to complete the project. In 2008 Rock Hill sold the property to Arco National Construction Company for construction of the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters. In August 2011 city hall moved to Thornton.

In April 2016 voters approved a property tax rate increase to allow the city to issue $6.1 million in general obligation bonds. In March 2017 the Board of Aldermen approved planning for a proposed municipal center — a 12,100-square-foot city hall and police and fire department — on Rock Hill Road. In May the city awarded a $5.5 million construction contract to K&amp;S Associates. Ceremonial ground breaking took place in June, with completion planned for late summer or early fall 2018.

;Rock Hill Public Library
The original library was opened in June 1944 on the second floor of the Fairfax House. The volunteer-run library was supported by donations and open two days a week. It was later moved to the first floor of Fairfax House. In 1947 the city voted to support the library with taxes after the library weathered a brief closure the previous year.

In 1957 Rock Hill Public Library moved into the former Lions Club building on Manchester Road. From 1963 to 1964 the library was temporarily relocated in the Rock Hill Presbyterian Church while the Manchester location was razed to construct a new city hall and library. The new library was dedicated in May 1965.

Kelley Sallade served as director of Rock Hill Public Library from December 1984 to March 2014. During her tenure the library acquired its first computers for patrons. In 1996 the library joined seven other county libraries to form the Municipal Library Consortium.

In July 2005 the library&#x27;s 2,400-square-foot location at city hall was closed and later razed for the Market at McKnight development. In January 2006 the library reopened at a temporary 3,696-square foot space on Manchester Road. In 2012 the library moved to a permanent 4456-square foot space at 9811 Manchester Road.

=== Police and fire ===
In 2004 mayor Robert Salamone approached the city of Brentwood about a possible takeover of Rock Hill police and fire services. The proposal was unpopular with Rock Hill residents. In July the Board of Aldermen voted unanimously to keep police and fire services local. The Board of Aldermen also passed resolutions consolidating some police and fire positions under a safety administrator position.

Police and fire moved to a residential property on Charleville Avenue when city hall on Manchester Road was razed in 2005.

In June 2018 the Board of Aldermen voted to transfer administration of the city&#x27;s uniformed employee pension plan to the Missouri Local Government Employees Retirement System.

;Rock Hill Police Department
Roger Stephens was the village&#x27;s first police officer, who was later served as Chief for 13 years. During Stephens&#x27; tenure the city purchased its first police motor car, a 1933 Ford V8. Marshall Whitecotton was appointed police chief c. 1944, then elected to eight additional two-year terms until his death in August 1966. Under Whitecotton, Brentwood cooperated with Rock Hill&#x27;s motorized six-man department, which by then had two-way radios.

Bradford Epperson served as police chief from 1966 until his death in April 1978. He was President of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association in 1975.

In 1973 Rock Hill voters made police chief an appointive position, having defeated a similar effort in 1966. After Chief James Johnstone retired, a police committee recommended promoting acting police chief Mark Zimmer for the permanent position but the recommendation was rejected by aldermen. Northwoods police chief Donald McDonald was appointed Rock Hill police chief in June 1983. Under his leadership Rock Hill became known for its aggressive enforcement of speed limits. He retired in June 1997. A 2000 Missouri study on racial profiling at traffic stops indicated Rock Hill pulled over significantly fewer black drivers than the county. Over four months black drivers made up 10.6 percent of 1,499 police stops.

Between 1983 and 2009 Officer Ronald Zeigler issued an estimated 150,000 tickets, mostly to speeding drivers. He was Missouri City Traffic Officer of the Year in 1985, Rock Hill Officer of the Year five times, and the 2000 Traffic Officer of the Millennium. Zeigler retired in October 2009. He &quot;put the city on the regional map as a place where speeding motorists could expect to pay for their ignorance of speed limits,&quot; according to the &quot;Webster-Kirkwood Times&quot;. In 2011 Ziegler returned part-time.

In 2007 Rock Hill Police opened a substation inside a bank on Manchester Road.

Paul Arnett became police chief circa 2006. Previously he had served with the department for nearly 30 years. The &quot;Webster-Kirkwood Times&quot;, which published Arnett&#x27;s crime dispatches (one of which appeared on &quot;David Letterman&quot;) wrote that &quot;writing a good crime report is hard. Almost as hard as doing police work. And Chief Arnett appears to have mastered both.&quot; Arnett retired in March 2013.

In April 2010 officer Matt Crosby was shot and paralyzed when he responded to a domestic disturbance call on Raritan Drive. The shooter received a life sentence with possibility for parole in September 2012.

;Rock Hill Fire Department
In October 1940 Rock Hill residents voted in favor of a bond issue creating a city fire service after a long-standing contract with Maplewood fire services ended. The fire station and city hall building was dedicated in December 1941.

John Kriska was fire chief circa 1990. He became safety administrator in 2004.

In 2006 the fire department received a record 932 calls. Current fire chief Kevin Halloran became chief c. 2008.

In 2008 the city received a $237,000 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a new fire truck. Fire house offices moved from the Charleville Firehouse to City Hall on Thornton Avenue while a fire engine and ambulance continued to operate out of the Charleville. CVS Pharmacy asked for $1.5 million TIF on the city&#x27;s behalf to build a new firehouse to replace the old, which would be demolished to build CVS. In January 2013 the city TIF commission recommended against using TIF to finance the fire department&#x27;s move. In April 2013 the Board of Alderman left the fire department out of the $1.2 million TIF, instead splitting the amount three ways between CVS, Webster Groves School District and the city.

In August 2016 Rock Hill agreed to explore consolidating its fire command with Clayton, Maplewood, Brentwood and Richmond Heights, however in September 2017 Rock Hill left the agreement after studies suggested the joint command would cost the city more than double its fire department budget.

August 21, 2018, was the grand opening of Rock Hill&#x27;s new city hall, police and fire departments at 827 N. Rock Hill Road.

== Civics groups ==
;Rock Hill Improvement Association
The Rock Hill Improvement Association was formed in 1938 to serve the &quot;best interests&quot; of the school district and city. In 1940 the association advocated for the creation of the fire department. In 1943 the association paid for the renovation of the second floor of the Fairfax House to house the library. The association met here weekly. Circa 1944 the Ladies Auxiliary of Rock Hill Improvement Association was established.

;Interested Citizens of Rock Hill Improvement Association
The Interested Citizens association was formed by black Rock Hill residents in October 1963. The group litigated against commercial rezoning of neighborhoods. The association presented the city&#x27;s flag design in 1965.

Sappington was named for a family of pioneer settlers. After Daniel Boone settled in modern-day Missouri, he would often return to Kentucky to tell residents about the land available in Missouri. John and Jemima Sappington sent two sons and a son-in-law to explore what is now Sappington in 1804. They bought 1,920 acres (3 square miles) of land - more than the area of present-day Sappington. The following year, the rest of the Sappington family arrived in the area. The descendants of the family eventually populated the area, and parts of present-day Crestwood and Sunset Hills.

<text>Shrewsbury is an inner-ring suburb of St. Louis, located in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 6,254 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Shrewsbury was officially platted in 1889. The land which became Shrewsbury originally belonged to Gregorie Sarpy and Charles Gratiot Sr.; by 1890, it was divided into farms and sold to families. The area now known as Shrewsbury was a farm owned by General John Murdoch. The Murdoch farm was called Shrewsbury Park, named after a town in England.

In 1913, concerned resident Joseph Burge organized the Shrewsbury Improvement Association to improve Shrewsbury and develop its first sewer system. Shrewsbury was incorporated and became a village in 1913; shortly thereafter a sanitation system was established, reducing water-borne diseases prevalent at the time.

In 1938, the United States government offered financial aid to the city of Shrewsbury, and land was acquired for the construction of a new city hall replacing the 1912 original. The new City Hall building was completed in October 1938. Shrewsbury&#x27;s new fire engine house and state-of-the-art equipment were dedicated in 1947; it was during this period that the Shrewsbury Garden Club was formed to maintain the beautiful trees and flowers throughout the city. The early 1950s were marked by the expansion of the public bus routes to connect Shrewsbury to St. Louis. The 1960s and &#x27;70s were times of great community growth, noted by the construction of city parks, a municipal pool, and Interstate 44.

The 1980s and &#x27;90s saw increased development of new homes, condominiums, apartments, shopping areas, and a new and improved City Center, which opened May 8, 1993, to coincide with Shrewsbury&#x27;s 80th year of incorporation. With the opening of the City Center, the previous City Hall building was converted to house the police and fire departments, and is now called the Public Safety Building.

Construction finished in 2006 on the Shrewsbury–Lansdowne Interstate 44 St. Louis MetroLink station on the eastern edge of the city, at Lansdowne Avenue and River Des Peres Boulevard.

Shrewsbury is home to the seminary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Louis, Kenrick–Glennon Seminary.

The Shrewsbury City Council in fall 2010 was expected to consider a plan to turn Kenrick Plaza, which has several open storefronts, into a Walmart store.

The city is roughly bounded by St. Louis to the east, Webster Groves to the north, Marlborough to the west and Mackenzie and Affton to the south.

==Police misconduct==

===Suspension and firing of Sgt. James Kuehnlein===

On September 7, 2007, Brett Darrow, a St. Louis City resident, created an Internet sensation after posting an online video of an encounter with St. George police Sgt. James Kuehnlein. In the video, Kuehnlein approaches Darrow while he waits in a parked car in a commuter parking lot. When Darrow asks Kuehnlein whether he did anything wrong, the officer orders Darrow out of the car and threatens to fabricate charges and arrest him.

Darrow told the news media that he pulled into the commuter lot to meet a friend. When the officer asked him for identification, Darrow said he did not immediately present it because he believed the officer stopped him without probable cause. After the video gained popularity on the Internet, Kuehnlein was suspended without pay. In response, St. George Police Chief Scott Uhrig said, &quot;I was very displeased when I saw the actions on the video.&quot;

The press later revealed that Sgt. Kuehnlein had been previously arrested for assault and theft, and in late September, he was fired by the city&#x27;s Board of Aldermen in a 5–0 vote.

In 2013, Kuehnlein was fired from the police department in Velda City, Missouri after a conviction for domestic violence. He was given a five-year suspended sentence, despite his prior criminal record.

===Sexual harassment allegations===

In 2000, St. George Police Chief Scott Uhrig, while serving as an Arnold, Missouri patrol officer, was accused of sexually harassing a 17-year-old girl during a traffic stop. The State Administrative Hearing Commission found that Scott Uhrig called the teenager &quot;beautiful, hot and tempting&quot;. Uhrig also allegedly asked the teen to come to his car for sex. Although Uhrig maintained his innocence, the Commission believed Uhrig acted illegally. They said his unwarranted sexual advances showed he could not enforce the law and were cause for discipline. Uhrig was suspended without pay and put on probation. Several years later, he took the helm at the St. George Police Department.

In December 2009, former Police Chief Scott Uhrig was arrested for sexual misconduct with a child under 15. Although the St. George Police Department was disbanded in late 2008, these charges allege that the crimes took place while Uhrig was chief of the department. He was ultimately found not guilty.

===Speed Trap Designation===

From the early 1980s to , St. George was known as a speed trap, though the speed trap itself was never able to provide sufficient revenue to pay the city&#x27;s debts, as reported in May 2022 by Reason magazine, &quot;...the town was deep in debt even before the speed trap ended—St. George voted 345–128 in favor of dissolution in November 2011.&quot;

==Arrests of Mayor Harold Goodman==

On October 22, 2007, St. George mayor Harold Goodman was arrested for possession of marijuana discovered during the execution of a search warrant at his home. Goodman said that he &quot;used marijuana sparingly when symptoms of Crohn&#x27;s disease, a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, flared up.&quot; No information was given at the time for the basis of the search warrant. Goodman took a leave of absence after his arrest.

On October 25, 2007, it was announced that Goodman had been re-arrested, for suspicion of possessing child pornography.

==History==
In the late 19th century, the area that is now University City was primarily farms and small farming communities. In 1902, Edward Gardner Lewis purchased 85 acres just outside the city limits of St. Louis, northwest of Forest Park, where the St. Louis World’s Fair would be held two years later in 1904. Lewis was the publisher of &quot;Woman’s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Woman’s Farm Journal.&quot; The 85-acre area would be the headquarters for Lewis’s publishing company, as well the site for a model city, inspired by the City Beautiful movement.

In 1903, Lewis broke ground for his publishing company’s headquarters: the Magazine Building (now City Hall), an ornate octagonal 135-foot tower. Soon, other architecturally significant structures and developments were erected, including an austere Egyptian temple, the Art Academy, and the Lion Gates. The Egyptian temple once served as a Masonic Temple and is now home to the Church of Scientology of St. Louis. The Art Academy and the Lion Gates were designed by the Eames &amp; Young architecture firm, which enlisted sculptor George Julian Zolnay to create the Lion Gates.

University City was formally incorporated in September 1906 and Lewis became its first mayor. Between 1910 and 1920, University City grew faster than any other city in Missouri. By the 1920s, University City’s main business corridor, along Delmar Boulevard just north of Washington University, was a bustling commercial district with new multifamily housing attracting new residents. Streetcars were the primary mode of transportation for shoppers and residents alike. After World War II, the city experienced its greatest housing construction.

In the 1960s, Black people displaced by urban renewal projects in the city of St. Louis began to move west into St. Louis County. &quot;University City was the first county municipality to struggle with the issues of fair housing and traditions of segregation,&quot; Nini Harris wrote. One innovative and controversial attempt to combat segregation was The University City Home Rental Trust.

==Education==
The School District of University City operates public schools.

University City has one high school: University City High School. The city also has one middle school, Brittany Woods Middle School, and four elementary schools: Flynn Park, Barbara C. Jordan, Pershing and Jackson Park. It is also home to two Catholic grade schools: Our Lady of Lourdes and Christ the King.

University City Public Library serves the community.

==Culture==
University City has a public library at 6701 Delmar Boulevard. Established in 1939, the library houses more than 150,000 volumes as well as music and spoken recordings, videotape and DVD collections, and works of art. The library is open seven days a week, including five evenings.
University City has 17 parks and one 9-hole golf course, Ruth Park Golf Course.

University City is home to COCA, the Center Of Creative Arts, which has a nationally recognized pre-professional dance training program. Alumni have danced for
Trisha Brown, Cecil Slaughter, Houston Ballet, Ballet Hispanico New York, Mark Morris, Alvin Ailey, the national tours of &quot;Wicked&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;, and &quot;Tarzan&quot; on Broadway.

The largest park is Heman Park (85.26 acres).

===Chinatown===
In recent decades, efforts have been made to establish a successor to the earlier ethnic neighborhood of Chinatown in the city of St. Louis. A number of Asian grocery stores and restaurants exist along Olive Boulevard between I-170 and Skinker Boulevard in University City. The route contains mostly Chinese businesses, rather than residents. Although efforts were made to designate part of the area as &quot;Chinatown&quot;, surrounding community members objected to the proposals. Also, the Missouri Department of Transportation has jurisdiction over part of Olive Boulevard and does not permit decorative archways or gateways spanning the roadway, as can be seen in other Chinatowns. As a result, there is no officially designated Chinatown in the St. Louis area. Since 2016, the University City government has sought to foster economic development along the corridor with tax incentives and by rebranding it &quot;University City Olive Link&quot;.

=== Delmar Loop ===
The Delmar Loop, an entertainment, cultural and restaurant district, sits along Delmar Boulevard, parallel to and six blocks north of the northern boundary of the university. Among the more prominent businesses in the Delmar Loop is Blueberry Hill, a restaurant and concert venue owned by Joe Edwards and Linda Edwards at 6504 Delmar Boulevard. Opened in 1972, its concert venue, The Duck Room, is noted for its relationship with the musician Chuck Berry, who performed there over 200 times.

The Loop is also home to the St. Louis Walk of Fame, which as of April 2020 memorializes more than 150 St. Louisans with brass stars embedded in the sidewalk.

<text>Valley Park is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 6,885 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Descendants of the Mississippian culture still had a settlement along the Meramec River in the mid-18th century, until the Native Americans were pushed out by colonial French and German immigrant farmers in the 1760s. The developing village over time was known as Nasby, Sulphur Springs, Quinette, Meramec, and finally Valley Park by &quot;circa&quot; 1890. It had one of the first post offices established in St. Louis County. It developed as a railroad hub for the Missouri Pacific and St. Louis-San Francisco rail lines.

In 1894, the town became the site of the first lynching in St. Louis County. A black man named John Buckner was lynched when accused of raping a local black woman and a white teenager. He was taken from the authorities by several local residents and farmers and hanged from the main bridge in town overlooking the Meramec River. The lynchers were never prosecuted.

Valley Park and Castlewood Park were developed as summer resorts. Castlewood Park is a short distance west on Big Bend. Castlewood Park became part of the Missouri State Park system.

However, Valley Park began to boom with development. It had railroads, the Meramec River, and what even then were considered main roads. Railroads played a big role in the town in the late 19th century and early 20th century. At the time, the St. Louis-San Francisco (Frisco) and Missouri Pacific served Valley Park; now it is Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe. At one time, the Meramec River had barge traffic.

In 1917, the town became incorporated. As many as 70 trains passed through Valley Park on any given day. The town became a center for industry with the building of the glass factory and other industries. Grocery stores and restaurants opened up; churches went from being mission churches to being congregations. Valley Park had a Saddle and Paddle Club located at Marshall and what is now Highway 141.

In the Great Flood of 1913, the main bridge was destroyed along with several factories causing extensive damage to the city&#x27;s economy.

St. Louis families would board the trains for summer vacations, weekends, or second family homes along the Meramec River. Clubhouses were built on the banks of the Meramec. Some of those clubhouses stood until the 1990s. The 1992 and 1993 floods destroyed them beyond repair. The remains were removed in order to allow for construction of the Meramec Valley River Basin Levee. The levee had a major flood test in March 2008; it saved Valley Park from a devastating flood. Most of the town also survived major flooding of the Meramec in 2015 and 2017, which forced closings of interstate and state roads in the area, and flooded other small towns. The intersection of Highway 141 and Interstate 44 was flooded and closed from December to January 2016. This area flooded again in 2017, cutting off wide areas of cross-country traffic.

The Frisco Hotel is an historic building located at 24 Front Street which was adapted as the Frisco Train Store.

Several parks are within the city limits, including Vance Trails, Leonard, and Brignole parks, and Meramec Landing for anglers and boaters. Simpson St. Louis County Park and Lake and Lone Elk County Park (which also has a wild bird sanctuary) are also within the city limits. Completion of the levee will include trails on top, overlooking the Meramec River for hiking and biking, as part of the Ozark Greenway Trails. In 2010, Valley Park annexed Peerless Park, a former city that disincorporated in 1998.

==Education==
The majority of Valley Park is served by Valley Park School District, and this district is home to one high school, Valley Park High School.

Portions of Valley Park are in Parkway C-2 School District, and other portions are in Rockwood R-VI School District.

Valley Park has a public library, the Valley Park Community Library.

==Controversy==

In 2006, Valley Park was featured in local, state and national news media when the city&#x27;s Board of Aldermen passed an ordinance almost identical to the ordinance passed by the city council of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which penalized landlords who rented to &quot;illegal aliens&quot;, businesses who employed &quot;illegal aliens&quot;, and others who aided and abetted &quot;illegal immigration.&quot;

Several landlords, along with the Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Opportunity Council, filed suit against the city. The lawsuit was supported by Bryan Cave, Washington University School of Law, St. Louis University Legal Clinic, the ACLU, MALDEF, the Hispanic Ministry of the Catholic Church and several private attorneys, who won a temporary restraining order.

Led by then-mayor Jeffrey Whitteaker, the Board of Aldermen amended the ordinance twice, and the coalition opposing the ordinances won restraining orders against both amended ordinances. The ordinances were invalidated following their repeal. A subsequent appeal by the city was dismissed as moot, in the Missouri Court of Appeals, as the subject ordinances had been repealed. Thereafter, following the city&#x27;s passage and publication of an ordinance prohibiting the knowing employment of unlawful aliens, a subsequent suit was brought in state court, subsequently removed by the city to federal court. After the city abandoned its efforts to punish landlords who could not prove their tenants were lawfully present and narrowed the enforcement mechanism for the remainder of the ordinance, the district court upheld the remainder of the ordinance. The plaintiffs filed an appeal on procedural issues and asked for the district court decision to be vacated. The appeal was denied and the decision of the district court was affirmed. The city&#x27;s immigration ordinances have never been enforced.

The Missouri General Assembly, in the 2008 legislative session, enacted legislation, to take effect in August 2009, which included language similar to Valley Park&#x27;s unlawful employment ordinance, to be enforced by the Missouri Attorney General. The state legislation had been under discussion and review for a significant time in both the Missouri Senate and House of Representatives. It remains unlawful, by Valley Park ordinance, to knowingly hire unlawful aliens within the city.

==Geography==
The city is located on the north bank of the Meramec River and is served by Missouri Route 141 which connects to I-44 south of the Meramec.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Attractions==

The Museum of Transportation was founded in 1944 and was at one time an original mainline of the Pacific Railroad. It was one of the first railroad tunnels west of the Mississippi River. The tunnel and depot are now on the National Register of Historic Places. With over seventy locomotives that visitors can look at and climb aboard, the museum has the most complete collection of American rail power anywhere, and its collection of automobiles, buses, streetcars, aircraft, horse-drawn vehicles and river boat material reflects the ever-changing nature of transportation. Guided walking tours and rides on the miniature Abbott Railroad (in season) are all part of the fun. There is a concession stand and gift shop of transportation memorabilia.

The World Bird Sanctuary is located on 305 acres of hardwood forest adjacent to Lone Elk Park. Visitors can see famous or lesser-known birds of prey and other wild birds. Throughout the years birds are on display, and at listed times there are bird shows. The sanctuary was founded in 1977 by ornithologist Walter C. Crawford, Jr. Crawford began his career at the St. Louis City Zoo. Crawford, working with &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; star Marlin Perkins, recognized a need for an organization dedicated to birds of prey. Mr. Crawford continued to direct the organization he founded until his death. He also traveled nationwide to speak at conventions and banquets with his humorous and inspirational message of environmental conservation. Today, Dawn Griffard is the executive director of World Bird Sanctuary.

Lone Elk Park also contains animals such as elk, deer, buffalo, and turkeys, which can be viewed on a drive through the park.

Meramec Landing sits along the Meramec River. It is a small area to park and unload a boat or jet ski into the river, or for fishing.

Simpson Park is located on the border of Valley Park next to Kirkwood. It has a large lake for boating and fishing, as well as a biking and hiking trail that goes all the way around the lake in a wooded area, and then stretches far outside the park down to the Meramec River. It also has a large playground and plenty of open fields to play soccer, baseball or even fly a kite.

Buder Park is located on the other side of the Meramec River and is considered a St. Louis County/Valley Park park. This park offers fishing access to the river, and open fields for flying kites, or playing football, soccer, or baseball. However, it is best known for its model plane activities. People from all over St. Louis and the surrounding counties come to this park to fly their model planes or fly tight lines. It has two tight lining tracks and a full runway for model airplanes.

==History==
The City of Vinita Park—along with the Village of Vinita Terrace—gets its name from &quot;Vinita Station&quot;, an electric rail car station that was located at the intersection of Midland and Page. The Vinita Park subdivision was laid out in 1905 by A.C. Stewart and was later marketed by Everett Davis, of the Davis Realty Development Company. A map titled &quot;Vinita Park -- &quot;The Next Reach&quot;, by the Davis Realty Development Company, is dated 1909 and can be found in the Library of Congress. On November 3, 1941, Vinita Park was incorporated as a village, including the northern subdivisions of Spring Avenue Heights and part of Midland Heights, the Atherton (south of Page Boulevard), and the Vinita Industrial Park. On March 13, 1950, Vinita Park changed its status to a City of the 4th Class. Voters of both Vinita Park and neighboring Vinita Terrace voted on November 8, 2016, to consolidate into one municipality, to be called the City of Vinita Park. 
The merger took effect on May 10, 2017.

==Education==
St. Louis County Library operates the Indian Trails Branch in Vinita Park. Vinita Park has three different school districts: Normandy, Ritenour, and University City.

==Government==
Vinita Park has a mayor and a board of aldermen. The mayor is elected to a four-year term and aldermen are elected to two-year terms. There are three ward divisions which each elect two alderman as required by Missouri law. Therefore, there are six aldermen in Vinita Park. If there is ever a tie vote in the board of aldermen, the mayor casts a tie-breaking vote but otherwise does not vote.

==Police department==
On June 1, 2015, Vinita Park initiated the North County Police Cooperative. They have partnered with nearby cities, Vinita Terrace and Wellston in providing police services to their communities. The cooperative currently has 30 police officers providing police protection in the area.

<text>Webster Groves is an inner-ring suburb of St. Louis in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 24,010 at the 2020 census.

The city is home to the main campus of Webster University.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Webster Groves is bounded to the east by Shrewsbury, on the north by Maplewood, Brentwood and Rock Hill, to the west by Glendale, Oakland, and Crestwood, and on the south by Affton and Marlborough.

==History==
Webster Groves is approximately west of the St. Louis city limits, and southwest of downtown St. Louis, in an area known to fur trappers and Missouri, Osage and Dakota indigenous people, until 1802, as the Dry Ridge. In the early 19th century, this region, once a part of the Louisiana Territory, was changing from Spanish to French ownership, and a system of land grants was inaugurated to promote immigration. During the early period of Spanish rule, officials gave land to settlers as a check against the English.

As part of this program, in 1802, Grégoire Sarpy was granted by Charles de Hault Delassus, the last Spanish lieutenant governor of the Illinois Country. The land grant covered the major area now known as Webster Groves.

Webster Groves&#x27; location on the Pacific Railroad line led to its development as a suburb. In 1892 the developers of Webster Park, an early housing subdivision, promoted the new community as the &quot;Queen of the Suburbs&quot;, offering residents superb housing options in a country-like atmosphere, as well as a swift commute to downtown St. Louis jobs. The first public school in the community was Douglass Elementary School, founded as a separate but equal school for African-American children in the post-Civil War black community in North Webster. In the 1920s, the school grew into Douglass High School, the only high school in St. Louis County for black students. The school operated until 1956, when the U.S. Supreme Court required desegregation.

As a suburban municipality, Webster Groves has its origins as five separate communities along adjacent railroad lines. Webster, Old Orchard, Webster Park, Tuxedo Park, and Selma merged in 1896 to implement public services and develop a unified city government. Since then, Webster Groves&#x27; tree-lined streets and abundance of single family homes have continued to attract people to the area as a &quot;great place to live, work and play&quot;, not solely for the wealthy commuter suburb that early developers envisioned but for families that cut across all socioeconomic lines. The geographic and economic diversity of Webster Groves is evident in its variety of neighborhoods.

In the 1960s, Webster Groves was featured in &quot;16 In Webster Groves&quot;, a televised documentary that writer Jonathan Franzen, a native of Webster Groves, described in his memoir &quot;The Discomfort Zone&quot; as an &quot;early experiment in hour-long prime-time sociology&quot;. According to Franzen, it depicted Webster Groves High School, which he attended only a few years after the documentary&#x27;s broadcast, as being &quot;ruled by a tiny elite of &#x27;soshies&#x27; who made life gray and marginal for the great majority of students who weren’t &#x27;football captains,&#x27; &#x27;cheerleaders&#x27; or &#x27;dance queens&#x27;&quot;; the school was depicted as having a &quot;student body obsessed with grades, cars and money.&quot; Franzen thought &quot;the Webster Groves depicted in it bears minimal resemblance to the friendly, unpretentious town I knew when I was growing up.&quot;

Webster Groves was the setting for the 1974–75 NBC television series &quot;Lucas Tanner&quot;.

In the wake of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, Webster Groves High School was again profiled, this time in &quot;Time&quot;, which described Webster Groves as a &quot;pretty town of old elms and deep porches&quot; and a &quot;mix of $90,000 cottages and $750,000 homes, young marrieds and old-line families and transient middle managers assigned to a stint in the St. Louis office who are looking for a comfortable place to settle and keep their kids on the track toward prosperity.&quot;

The Webster Groves High School Statesmen maintain one of the oldest high school football rivalries west of the Mississippi River with the Pioneers of Kirkwood High School. The two teams typically play each other in the Missouri Turkey Day Game each Thanksgiving, if their playoff schedules permit it; they also have faced each other in the state playoff tournaments several times in recent years.

<text>Bloomsdale is a city in Ste. Genevieve County, Missouri, United States. The population was 639 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
The name of the town is most likely derived from the name of a Catholic priest, Father Blume.

==History==
Bloomsdale was known as early as 1839 as &quot;La Fourche à Duclos&quot;, meaning &quot;the fork of Duclos&quot; and named for the creek by the same name. Its parish priest, a Father Blume, wished his parishioners to all reside on one side of the stream, and so bought land for a settlement on what is now called Establishment Creek moved to the present site of Bloomsdale. One account has it that &quot;Blumesdale&quot; was mailed to Washington, D.C., as the name of the town&#x27;s post office. But the name was illegible, so the story goes, so Washington called the office Bloomsdale. More likely, Washington anglicized the German name Blume (&quot;flower&quot;) to Bloom. Either way, the name honors Father Blume.

Bloomsdale is located in the eastern part of Jackson Township, near Establishment Creek.

<text>Ste. Genevieve ( ) is a city in Ste. Genevieve Township and is the county seat of Ste. Genevieve County, Missouri, United States. The population was 4,999 at the 2020 census. Founded in 1735 by French Canadian colonists and settlers from east of the river, it was the first organized European settlement west of the Mississippi River in present-day Missouri. Today, it is home to Ste. Genevieve National Historical Park, the 422nd unit of the National Park Service.

==History==
Founded around 1740 by Canadian settlers and migrants from settlements in the Illinois Country just east of the Mississippi River, Ste. Geneviève is the oldest permanent European settlement in Missouri. It was named for Saint Genevieve (who lived in the 5th century AD), the patron saint of Paris, the capital of France. While most residents were of French-Canadian descent, many of the founding families had been in the Illinois Country for two or three generations. It is one of the oldest colonial settlements west of the Mississippi River. 

This area was known as New France, Illinois Country, or the Upper Louisiana territory. Traditional accounts suggested a founding of 1735 or so, but historian Carl Ekberg has documented a more likely founding about 1750. The population to the east of the river needed more land, as the soils in the older villages had become exhausted. Improved relations with hostile Native Americans, such as the Osage, made settlement possible.

Prior to arrival of French Canadian settlers, indigenous peoples of succeeding cultures had lived in the region for more than one thousand years. The best known prior to the historic tribes were the Mississippian culture, which developed complex earthworks at such sites as Cahokia, and had a broad cross-continental trading network along the Mississippi-Ohio river waterways, from the south to near the Great Lakes. 

At the time of European settlement, however, no Indian tribe lived nearby on the west bank. Jacques-Nicolas Bellin&#x27;s map of 1755, the first to show Ste. Genevieve in the Illinois Country, showed Kaskaskia natives on the east side of the river, but no Indian village on the west side within 100 miles of Ste. Genevieve. Osage hunting and war parties did enter the area from the north and west. The region had been relatively abandoned by 1500, likely due to environmental exhaustion, after the peak of Mississippian culture civilization at Cahokia, the largest city of this culture. 

At the time of its founding by ethnic French, Ste. Genevieve was the last of a triad of French Canadian settlements in this area of the mid-Mississippi Valley. About five miles northeast of Ste. Genevieve on the east side of the river was Fort de Chartres (in the Illinois Country); it stood as the official capital of the area. Kaskaskia, which became Illinois&#x27;s first capital upon statehood, was located about five miles southeast. Prairie du Rocher and Cahokia, Illinois (an independent settlement not attached to the ancient Mississippian site) were other early local French colonial settlements on the east side of the river.

Following defeat by the British in the French and Indian War, in 1762 under the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France secretly ceded the area of the west bank of the Mississippi River to Spain, which formed Louisiana (New Spain). The Spanish moved the capital of Upper Louisiana from Fort de Chartres fifty miles upriver to St. Louis. They ruled with a light hand and often through mostly French-speaking officials. Although under Spanish control for more than 40 years, Ste. Genevieve retained its French language, customs and character. Like other European colonists, the French held enslaved African Americans as workers. Most slaveholders had a few such workers, as they had relatively small farms. Some slaves were used as workers in lead mining.

In 1763, the French ceded the land east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris that ended Europe&#x27;s Seven Years&#x27; War, also known on the North American front as the French and Indian War. French-speaking people from Canada and settlers east of the Mississippi went west to live beyond British rule; they also flocked to Ste. Genevieve after George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763. This transformed all of the captured French land between the Mississippi and the Appalachian Mountains, except Quebec, into an Indian reserve. The king required settlers to leave or get British permission to stay. These requirements were regularly violated by European-American settlers, who resented efforts to restrict their expansion west of the Appalachians.

During the 1770s, bands of Little Osage and Missouri tribes repeatedly raided Ste. Genevieve to steal settlers&#x27; horses. But the fur trade, marriage of French-Canadian men with Native American women, and other commercial dealings created many ties between Native Americans and the Canadiens. During the 1780s, some Shawnee and Lenape (Delaware) migrated to the west side of the Mississippi following rebel American victory in its Revolutionary War. The tribes established villages south of Ste. Genevieve. The Peoria also moved near Ste. Genevieve in the 1780s but had a peaceful relationship with the village. It was not until the 1790s that the Big Osage pressed the settlement harder; they conducted repeated raids, and killed some settlers. In addition, they attacked the Peoria and Shawnee.

While at one point Spanish administrators wanted to attack the Big Osage, there were not sufficient French settlers to recruit for a militia to do so. The Big Osage had 1250 men in their village, and lived in the prairie. In 1794 Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, the Spanish governor at New Orleans, appointed brothers Pierre Chouteau and Auguste Chouteau of St. Louis to have exclusive trading privileges with the Big Osage. They built a fort and trading post on the Osage River in Big Osage territory. While the natives did not entirely cease their raids on Ste. Genevieve, commercial diplomacy and rewards of the fur trade eased some relations.

===Le Vieux Village (Old Ste. Genevieve c. 1750)===

Following the great flood of 1785, the town moved from its initial location on the floodplain of the Mississippi River, to its present location two miles north and about a half mile inland. It continued to prosper as a village devoted to agriculture, especially wheat, maize and tobacco production. Most of the families were yeomen farmers, although there was a wealthier level among the residents. The village raised sufficient grain to send many tons of flour annually for sale to Lower Louisiana and New Orleans. This was essential to the survival of the southern colonies, which could not grow sufficient grain in their climate. In 1807, Frederick Bates, the secretary of the Louisiana Territory after the United States made the Louisiana Purchase, noted Ste. Genevieve was &quot;the most wealthy village in Louisiana&quot; (meaning the full Territory).

===1852 Ste. Genevieve Stampede===

On 4th September 1852, eight enslaved men, including five from Ste. Genevieve, tried to escape enslavement by crossing the Mississippi River towards Sparta, Illinois, &quot;widely reputed as a haven for freedom seekers&quot;. They had been working in mines owned by the Valle family of Ste. Genevieve, some because they were held (&quot;owned&quot;) by the Valles. On 9th September, slaveholders put out a $1600 reward for the return of the men who were all recaptured.

===Architecture===
The oldest surviving buildings of Ste. Genevieve, described as &quot;French Creole colonial&quot;, were all built during the period of Spanish rule in the late 18th century. The most distinctive buildings of this period were the &quot;vertical wooden post&quot; constructions. Walls of buildings were built based on wood &quot;posts&quot; either dug into the ground (&quot;poteaux en terre&quot;) or set on a raised stone or brick foundation (&quot;poteaux sur solle&quot;). This was different from the log cabin style associated with the Anglo-American frontier settlements of the United States northeast, mid-Atlantic and Upper South, for which logs are stacked horizontally.

The most distinctive of the vertical post houses are &quot;poteaux en terre&quot; (&quot;posts-in-the-ground&quot;), where the walls made of upright wooden posts do not support the floor. The floor is supported by separate stone pillars. As the wooden posts were partially set into dirt, the walls of such buildings were extremely vulnerable to flood damage, termites and rot. Three of the five surviving &quot;poteaux en terre&quot; houses in the nation are in Ste. Genevieve. The other two are located in Pascagoula, Mississippi and near Natchitoches, Louisiana.

Most of the oldest buildings in the city are &quot;poteaux sur solle&quot; (&quot;posts-on-a-sill&quot;). One of the oldest structures is the Louis Bolduc House built in 1792, which has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. Louis Bolduc originally built a smaller house in 1770 at Ste. Genevieve&#x27;s first riverfront location. Although much of the house was severely damaged by flooding, parts were dismantled and moved north as the community developed the new site in 1785. Bolduc incorporated these materials into his new and larger house, built in 1792–1793. The three large ground-floor rooms expressed Bolduc&#x27;s wealth. Other structures of note are the 1806 La Maison de Guibourd Historic House, the 1818 Felix Vallé House State Historic Site, the 1792 Beauvais-Amoureux House, the 1790s Bequette-Ribault House, and the 1808 Old Louisiana Academy, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Culture===
For decades, Ste. Genevieve was primarily an agricultural community. The &quot;habitants&quot; raised chiefly wheat and corn (maize), as well as tobacco. They produced more wheat than residents of St. Louis, and their grain products were shipped south, critical to survival of the French community at New Orleans, which had the wrong climate to cultivate such grains.

The village followed traditional practices: most of the townspeople lived on lots in town. They farmed land held in a common large field. This land was assigned and cultivated in the French style, in long, narrow strips that extended back from the river to the hills (at the first location) so that each settler would have some waterfront. Only the exterior of the &quot;Grand Champ&quot; (Big Field) was fenced, but each owner of land was responsible for fencing his portion, to keep out livestock. The &quot;habitants&quot; used the same types of implements and plows as did farmers in 18th-century France. They used teams of oxen to pull the wheeled plows.

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1804, Anglo-Americans as well as German immigrants migrated to the village. It became more oriented to trade and merchants, but villagers retained many of their French cultural ways. The Sisters of St. Joseph, a French teaching order, established a convent in the town, whose sisters taught in a Catholic school. The current Ste. Genevieve Catholic Church was built in 1876 and modeled after the Gothic style of those in France. It was the third Catholic church built by the villagers.

Ste. Genevieve continues to celebrate its French cultural heritage with numerous annual events. Among them are La Guiannée, a celebration associated with Christmas; French Fest; Jour de Fête; King&#x27;s Ball, and many others. Heritage tourism is important to the economy.

===Late 19th century to present===
By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Ste. Genevieve also had numerous lime kilns and quarries, important to the industrialization of nearby cities. The city had numerous African-American families who had long been residents of the community, including people of color of partial French and German ancestry. Like the ethnic European French, most of these African-American families were members of the Catholic church in the town, and some were educated and property owners. Some had also been French speakers in the colonial period. 

As the lime kilns and quarries were expanded, African-American migrant workers, mostly men, came from Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas to take jobs in these industries. They tended to belong to Protestant sects, if they were religiously affiliated. From quite different cultural backgrounds, the two groups of African Americans did not intermingle much. The migrant workers lived in poorer areas of town or outside in company housing. They tended to congregate in a neighborhood referred to as The Shacks.

====Race riot of 1930====
By 1930 Ste Genevieve had about 2662 residents, of whom 170 were African American and the remainder European American. Another 170 African Americans lived outside the town in the county, closer to the work sites. The riot was a four day disturbance, long shrouded in secrecy, during which vigilantes drove away most of the town&#x27;s black residents, many of whom were recent arrivals recruited to work in local lime kilns and stone quarries.

Greene, Kremer and Holland (1993) state, “In 1930 state troopers were twice called into the little town of Ste. Genevieve to prevent a triple lynching. The entire black population, with the exception of two families, left town after the threatened lynchings.”

===The &quot;French Connection&quot;===
The Ste. Genevieve-Modoc Ferry across the Mississippi River to Illinois is nicknamed the &quot;French Connection&quot;. This refers to the 1971 film of the same name and, more directly, to the ferry&#x27;s link to other French colonial sites in the area, such as Fort de Chartres and Fort Kaskasia State Historic Sites, and the Pierre Menard home. It runs daily year-round, unless the river is flooding. It can carry vehicles, walk-on passengers, and travelers with bicycles.

==Geography==
Ste. Genevieve is located along the west bank of the Mississippi River near the Illinois state line along Interstate 55, U.S. Route 61, and Missouri Route 32, approximately south-southeast of St. Louis and north-northwest of Memphis, Tennessee.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. It has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) and average monthly temperatures range from in January to in July.
