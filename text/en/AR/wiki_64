<text>John Edward Robinson (born December 27, 1943) is an American convicted serial killer, kidnapper, rapist, and forger. He was found guilty and received the death penalty in 2003 for three murders committed in Kansas. Two years later, as part of a plea deal, he admitted responsibility in five other murders committed in Missouri, for which he received multiple life sentences without possibility of parole. Robinson, a prolific con man and embezzler, used online chatrooms to make contact with some of his victims while under the alias &quot;Slavemaster&quot; – this makes him the first known serial killer to have used the internet to lure in victims.

==Early life and criminal history==
John Edward Robinson was born on December 27, 1943, in Cicero, Illinois, the third of five children to Henry and Alberta Robinson, an abusive alcoholic father and a strict disciplinarian mother. In 1957, Robinson became an Eagle Scout and travelled to London with a group of Scouts who performed before Queen Elizabeth II; afterwards backstage he received a kiss from actress and singer Judy Garland. 

Robinson enrolled at Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago, a private boys school for aspiring priests, but dropped out after one year due to disciplinary issues. School records showed that he was a poor and failing student and frequently got involved in fights with his 
classmates and spent much time in school detention. In 1961, Robinson enrolled at Morton Junior College in Cicero to become a medical radiographer, but dropped out after two years. In 1964, he moved to Kansas City and married Nancy Jo Lynch, who gave birth to their first child, John Jr., in 1965, followed by daughter Kimberly in 1967, and twins Christopher and Christine in 1971.

In 1969, Robinson was arrested in Kansas City for embezzling $33,000 from the medical practice of Dr. Wallace Graham, where he worked as a radiographer using forged credentials. He was sentenced to three years of probation. The following year, he violated his probation by moving to Chicago without his probation officer&#x27;s permission and gained a job as an insurance salesman at the R.B. Jones Company. In 1971, he was arrested for embezzling funds and was ordered back to Kansas City, where his probation was extended. In 1975, Robinson&#x27;s probation was extended again after an arrest on charges of securities fraud and mail fraud in connection with a phony medical consulting company he had formed.

Robinson became a Scoutmaster, a baseball coach, and a Sunday school teacher. In 1977, he was named to the board of directors of a local charitable organization where he forged letters from its executive director to the mayor of Kansas City and from the mayor to civic leaders, naming him as the organization&#x27;s &quot;Man of the Year&quot;. Under that guise, he hosted an awards luncheon in his honor. After completing his probation in 1979, Robinson was arrested for embezzlement and check forgery, for which he served sixty days in jail in 1982. After his release, he formed a bogus hydroponics business and stole $25,000 from a friend to whom he promised a fast investment return so the friend could pay for his dying wife&#x27;s medical care.

==Murders==
Robinson is known to be responsible for eight homicides, but his total victim tally remains unknown. Kansas and Missouri police note that long stretches of Robinson&#x27;s time remain unaccounted for, and considering how some of Robinson&#x27;s confirmed victims have never been found or were not reported missing, authorities fear that there are additional undiscovered victims. &quot;He&#x27;s maintained the secrets about what he&#x27;s done with the women. He won&#x27;t ever tell. It&#x27;s the last control he&#x27;s got,&quot; said one investigator. &quot;There are probably other barrels waiting to be opened, other bodies waiting to be found.&quot;
* In 1984, having established two more fraudulent shell companies, Robinson hired Paula Guylene Godfrey, aged 19, ostensibly to work as a sales representative for Robinson&#x27;s management consulting firm, Equi II. Godfrey was interested in pursuing a business career and told her family that Robinson had arranged for her and a group of women to fly to San Antonio, Texas to enroll in a clerical skills course. Robinson picked Godfrey up at her residence in Overland Park, Kansas on September 1, 1984, to drive her to the airport for her flight. After hearing nothing further from her, Godfrey&#x27;s parents filed a missing persons report. Police questioned Robinson, who denied any knowledge of her whereabouts. Several days later, her parents received a typewritten letter, with Godfrey&#x27;s signature at the bottom, thanking Robinson for his help and asserting that she was &quot;OK&quot; and did not want to see her family. The investigation was terminated as Godfrey was of legal age, and there was no evidence of wrongdoing. No trace of Godfrey has ever been found.
* In 1985, using the alias John Osborne, Robinson met 19-year-old Lisa Stasi and her four-month-old daughter, Tiffany Stasi, at Hope House, a shelter for homeless women in Kansas City. Stasi told relatives that she was joining the Kansas City Outreach Program, an organization designed to assist young mothers. Robinson presented the program to Lisa as a way to receive free room and board while studying for her GED. He promised Stasi a job and a stable living situation in Chicago in exchange for signing several sheets of blank stationery. Lisa and Tiffany checked into Room 131 at the Rodeway Inn in Overland Park in early-January 1985. Lisa told her relatives that &quot;Mr. Osborne&quot; arranged and paid for their new accommodations. On January 10, Robinson arrived at Lisa&#x27;s sister-in-law&#x27;s house where Lisa and Tiffany entered his vehicle and purportedly returned to the motel. A few days later, Robinson contacted his brother and sister-in-law who had been unable to adopt a baby through traditional channels, informing them that he knew of a baby whose mother had killed herself. For $5,500 in &quot;legal fees&quot;, the couple received Tiffany, whose identity was confirmed by DNA testing in 2000, and a set of authentic-appearing adoption papers with the forged signatures of two lawyers and a judge. Stasi was never heard from again.
*27-year-old Catherine Frances Clampitt left her child with her parents in Wichita Falls, Texas, and moved to Kansas City to live with her brother&#x27;s family and find employment in January 1987. She located an advertisement for Equi II, a management consulting firm in Overland Park, Kansas, shortly after her arrival which promised extensive traveling and a new wardrobe. Robinson hired her and Clampitt began staying at several local hotels near the Equi II offices. On June 15, 1987, Clampitt left to have a meeting with Robinson. She has not been seen since. Her missing persons&#x27; case remains open.
* Between 1987 and 1993, Robinson was incarcerated, first in Kansas on multiple fraud convictions and later in Missouri for another fraud conviction and parole violations. At the Western Missouri Correctional Facility, he met 49-year-old Beverly Bonner, the prison librarian. Upon his release in January 1994, Bonner left her husband, a prison doctor, and moved to Kansas to work for him. After Robinson arranged for Bonner&#x27;s alimony checks to be forwarded to a Kansas post office box, her family never heard from her again. For several years, Bonner&#x27;s mother had been forwarding her alimony checks and Robinson continued cashing them.
* After his release, Robinson discovered the Internet and roamed online chatrooms using the name Slavemaster, looking for women who enjoyed playing the submissive partner role during sex. An early online correspondent was Sheila Faith, 45, whose 15-year-old daughter Debbie Faith was a wheelchair user due to spina bifida. Robinson, portraying himself as a wealthy businessman and philanthropist, offered to pay Debbie&#x27;s medical expenses and give Sheila a job. In 1994, the mother and daughter moved from Fullerton, California, to Kansas City and immediately disappeared. Robinson cashed Faith&#x27;s pension checks for the next seven years.
* Robinson became well known in increasingly popular BDSM chatrooms. In 1999, he offered a job and a bondage relationship to Izabela Lewicka, a 21-year-old Polish immigrant living in Indiana. When she moved to Kansas City, Robinson gave Lewicka an engagement ring despite still being married and brought her to the county registrar, where they paid for a marriage license that was never picked up. It is unclear whether Lewicka believed she and Robinson were married; she told her parents that she had married but never told them her husband&#x27;s name. She did sign a 115-item slave contract that gave Robinson almost total control over every aspect of her life, including her bank accounts. In 1999, Lewicka disappeared. Robinson told a web designer he employed that she had been caught smoking marijuana and deported. Her body was found in a drum on Robinson&#x27;s farm in Kansas in 2000.
* In March 2000, a 27-year-old licensed practical nurse named Suzette Trouten moved from Michigan to Kansas to travel with Robinson as his submissive sex slave. Trouten&#x27;s mother received several typed letters signed by her daughter and purportedly mailed while the couple was abroad, although the envelopes all bore Kansas City postmarks. The letters were, her mother said, uncharacteristically free of typographical errors. Later, Robinson told Trouten&#x27;s mother that she had run off with an acquaintance after stealing money from him. Along with Lewicka, her body was found in a drum on Robinson&#x27;s farm in Kansas in the same year.

==Arrest and conviction==
Over time, Robinson became increasingly careless, and his ability to avoid detection declined. By 1999, he had attracted the attention of authorities in Kansas and Missouri as his name frequently came up in missing person investigations. He was arrested in June 2000 at his farm near La Cygne, Kansas, after a woman filed a sexual battery complaint against him and another charged him with stealing her sex toys. The theft charge finally gave investigators the probable cause they needed to obtain search warrants. 

On the farm, a task force found the decaying bodies of two women, later identified as Lewicka and Trouten, in two chemical drums. Across the state line in Missouri, investigators searched a storage facility where Robinson rented two garages. They found three similar chemical drums containing corpses subsequently identified as Bonner, Faith, and Faith&#x27;s daughter. All five women were killed in the same way, by one or more blows to the head with a blunt instrument.

In 2002, Robinson stood trial in Kansas for the murders of Trouten, Lewicka, and Stasi along with multiple lesser charges. After the longest criminal trial in Kansas history, he was convicted on all counts. Robinson received the death penalty for the murders of Trouten and Lewicka, and life imprisonment for Stasi&#x27;s murder because she was killed before Kansas reinstated the death penalty. He received a 5-to-20-year prison sentence for interfering with the parental custody of Stasi&#x27;s baby, 20 years for kidnapping Trouten, and seven months for theft.

After his Kansas convictions, Robinson faced murder charges in Missouri based on the evidence discovered in that state. Missouri aggressively pursued capital punishment convictions, so Robinson&#x27;s attorneys wanted to avoid a trial there. Chris Koster, the Missouri prosecutor, insisted as a condition of any plea bargain that Robinson lead authorities to the bodies of Stasi, Godfrey, and Clampitt. Robinson, who has never cooperated with investigators, refused. However, Koster faced pressure to make a deal because his case was not technically airtight⁠. Among other issues, there was no unequivocal evidence that any of the murders had been committed within his jurisdiction. Robinson, on the other hand, faced pressure to plead guilty to avoid an almost certain death sentence in Missouri, and failing that, yet another capital murder trial back in Kansas.

When it became clear that the women&#x27;s remains would never be found without Robinson&#x27;s cooperation, a compromise was reached. In a carefully scripted plea in October 2003, Robinson acknowledged that Koster had enough evidence to convict him of capital murder for the deaths of Godfrey, Clampitt, Bonner, and the Faiths. Though his statement was technically a guilty plea and was accepted as such by the Missouri court, observers remarked that it was notably devoid of any remorse or specific acceptance of responsibility. Robinson received a life sentence without possibility of parole for each of the five murders.

In November 2015, the Kansas Supreme Court vacated the Trouten and Stasi murder convictions on technicalities, but upheld the Lewicka conviction and its accompanying death sentence. The ruling marked the first time Kansas&#x27;s highest court has upheld a death sentence since the reinstatement of capital punishment there in 1994. Robinson currently remains on death row at the El Dorado Correctional Facility in Kansas.

==Aftermath==
In 2005, Nancy Robinson filed for divorce after forty-one years of marriage, citing incompatibility and irreconcilable differences. The following year, Stasi&#x27;s daughter—known since her faked adoption as Heather Robinson—filed a civil suit against Truman Medical Center in Kansas City and social worker Karen Gaddis. The suit accused Gaddis of putting Robinson in contact with Stasi and her newborn daughter in 1984 after he told Gaddis that he ran a charitable organization assisting &quot;unwed mothers of white babies.&quot; 

In 2007, Heather and the hospital reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum, which Heather said she would split with her biological grandmother, Patricia Sylvester. Heather won a second judgment in 2007 preventing Robinson from profiting from any future potential book sales or film rights. In 2006, the body of a young woman was found in a barrel in an area of rural Iowa where Robinson reportedly had a business partner. She was initially considered a possible victim but was later identified and ruled out.

==In media==
* A 2001 book by John Glatt, &quot;Internet Slave Master&quot; (), documented Robinson&#x27;s life up to the time of his Kansas trial. A second book by Glatt, &quot;Depraved&quot; (), published in 2005, focused on the lives of Robinson&#x27;s victims and others affected by his crimes. 
* &quot;Anyone You Want Me to Be: A True Story of Sex and Death on the Internet&quot; () by John Douglas and Stephen Singular was published in 2003.
* Sue Wiltz&#x27; book &quot;Slave Master&quot; was published in 2004.

Robinson&#x27;s criminal activities were also profiled on episodes of the A&amp;E series &quot;Cold Case Files&quot;, Investigation Discovery&#x27;s &quot;FBI: Criminal Pursuit&quot;, &quot;Very Scary People&quot;, &quot;Sins &amp; Secrets&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair Confidential&quot;, &quot;It Takes a Killer&quot;, and &quot;Deadly Doctors&quot;, as well as Forensic Files, and &quot;The New Detectives&quot; on the Discovery Channel.

<doc id="123455" wikidata="Q957686" url="?curid=123455" title="Big Arm, Montana">
<text>Big Arm is a census-designated place (CDP) in Lake County, Montana, United States. The population was 177 at the 2010 census, up from 131 in 2000.

<text>This is a list of Indian reservations and other tribal homelands in the United States. In Canada, the Indian reserve is a similar institution.

==Federally recognized reservations==
There are approximately 326 federally recognized Indian Reservations in the United States. Most of the tribal land base in the United States was set aside by the federal government as Native American Reservations. In California, about half of its reservations are called rancherías. In New Mexico, most reservations are called Pueblos. In some western states, notably Nevada, there are Native American areas called Indian colonies. Populations are the total census counts and include non-Native American people as well, sometimes making up a majority of the residents. The total population of all of them is 1,043,762.

== Federally recognized trust lands ==
==Alaska Native village statistical areas==
Alaska Native Village Statistical Areas are geographical areas the United States Census Bureau uses to track demographic data. These statistical areas represent permanent or seasonal residences of Alaska natives. Specifically, they contain a significant proportion of persons who are either member of, or receiving services from a defining Alaska Native Village for at least one season of the year. Alaska Natives previously had many small reserves scattered around Alaska; however, all but one (the Annette Island Reserve of Tsimshian) were repealed with the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971.

==Hawaiian home lands==


==Oklahoma tribal statistical areas==


(*) declared reservations under &quot;McGirt v. Oklahoma&quot;

== State-recognized reservations ==
A state designated American Indian reservation is the land area designated by a state for state-recognized American Indian tribes who lack federal recognition.

==State designated tribal statistical areas==
State Designated Tribal Statistical Areas are geographical areas the United States Census Bureau uses to track demographic data. These areas have a substantial concentration of members of tribes that are State recognized but not Federally recognized and do not have a reservation or off-reservation trust land.
==Tribal designated statistical areas==
A tribal designated statistical area is a statistical entity identified and delineated for the Census Bureau by a federally recognized American Indian tribe that does not currently have a federally established Indian reservation.

<text>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada (PC; ) was a centre to centre-right federal political party in Canada that existed from 1942 to 2003.

From Canadian Confederation in 1867 until 1942, the original Conservative Party of Canada participated in numerous governments and had multiple names. In 1942, its name was changed to the Progressive Conservative Party under the request of newly elected party leader Premier John Bracken of Manitoba, a former member of the Progressive Party of Manitoba. In the 1957 federal election, John Diefenbaker carried the party to their first victory in 27 years and the following year, led the party to the largest federal electoral landslide in history. During his tenure, human rights initiatives were achieved, most notably the Bill of Rights. In the 1963 federal election, the party lost power and would not regain it until 1979, when Joe Clark led the party to a minority government victory. The party lost power just nine months later and in 1983, Clark lost his leadership role to Brian Mulroney, who helped the PC Party gain popularity in Quebec. Mulroney won back-to-back majority governments in 1984 and 1988, and during his tenure, major economic reforms such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the goods and services tax (GST) were introduced. 

The GST, the government&#x27;s failed attempts to revise the Constitution with the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords, and the early 1990s recession, led to the party&#x27;s increasing unpopularity and eventual collapse in the 1993 federal election where they won just two seats. In Western Canada the bulk of the party&#x27;s support transferred to the right-wing populist Reform Party (which later became the Canadian Alliance), while in Quebec support shifted to the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois. The Progressive Conservatives failed to recover much lost ground in the subsequent 1997 and 2000 federal elections. When it became clear that neither the Progressive Conservatives nor the Canadian Alliance could on their own defeat the incumbent Liberals, an effort to unite the right-of-centre parties emerged. Eventually, in 2003 the party membership voted to dissolve the party and merge with the Canadian Alliance to form the current Conservative Party of Canada.

Like their British counterparts, members and supporters of the Progressive Conservative Party were known as &quot;Tories&quot;. Provincial variants of the Progressive Conservative Party continue to exist in a number of provinces.

==Historical overview==
The party pre-dates Confederation in 1867, when it accepted many conservative-leaning former members of the Liberal Party into its ranks. At Confederation, the Conservative Party became Canada&#x27;s first governing party under Sir John A. Macdonald. The federal Tories governed Canada for over 40 of the country&#x27;s first 70 years of existence.

However, the party spent the majority of its history in opposition as the nation&#x27;s number-two federal party, behind the Liberal Party of Canada. From 1896 to 1993, the Tories formed government six times—from 1911 to 1921, briefly in 1926, from 1930 to 1935, from 1957 to 1963, from 1979 to 1980 and from 1984 to 1993. It stands as the only Canadian party to have won more than 200 seats in an election—a feat it accomplished twice: in 1958 and 1984.

The party adopted the &quot;Progressive Conservative&quot; name in 1942 when Manitoba Premier John Bracken, a long-time leader of that province&#x27;s Progressive Party, agreed to become leader of the federal Conservatives on condition that the party add &quot;Progressive&quot; to its name. Despite the name change, most former Progressive supporters continued to support the Liberal Party of Canada or the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, and Bracken&#x27;s leadership of the Conservative Party came to an end in 1948. Many Canadians simply continued to refer to the party as &quot;the Conservatives&quot;.

A major weakness of the party since 1885 was its inability to win support in Quebec, estranged significantly by that year&#x27;s execution of Louis Riel. The Conscription Crisis of 1917 exacerbated the issue. Even though the Conservative Party of Quebec dominated politics in that province for the first 30 years of Confederation at both the federal and provincial levels, in the 20th century the party was never able to become a force in provincial politics, losing power in 1897, and dissolving in 1935 into the Union Nationale, which took power in 1936 under Maurice Duplessis.

In 20th-century federal politics, the Conservatives were often seen as insensitive to French-Canadian ambitions and interests and seldom succeeded in winning more than a handful of seats in Quebec, with a few notable exceptions:
* the 1930 federal election, in which Richard Bedford Bennett surprisingly led the party to a thin majority government victory by securing 24 seats in rural Quebec;
* the 1958 federal election, in which John Diefenbaker rode the backing of the right-leaning Union Nationale provincial government in Quebec to 50 of the province&#x27;s 75 seats; and
* the federal elections of 1984 and 1988, when party leader Brian Mulroney, a fluently bilingual Quebecois, built an electoral coalition that included Quebec nationalists.

The party never fully recovered from the fragmentation of Mulroney&#x27;s broad coalition in the late 1980s, resulting in part from the failure of two provinces to ratify the Meech Lake Accord. The party suffered a decade-long decline following the 1993 federal election, during which it did not hold more than 20 seats in the House of Commons. It formally dissolved on December 7, 2003, when it merged with the Canadian Alliance to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada.

Several loosely associated provincial Progressive Conservative parties continue to exist in Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador. As well, a small rump of senators opposed the merger, and continued to sit in the Parliament of Canada as Progressive Conservatives. The last one of them rescinded their party status in 2016. The Yukon association of the party renamed itself as the Yukon Party in 1990. The British Columbia Progressive Conservative Party changed its name to the British Columbia Conservative Party in 1991. Saskatchewan&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party effectively ceased to exist in 1997, when the Saskatchewan Party formed – primarily from former PC Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) with a few Saskatchewan Liberal MLAs joining them.

==Ideology==

The Progressive Conservative Party was generally on the centre-right on the political spectrum. From 1867 on, the party was identified with Protestant and, in Quebec, Roman Catholic social values, British imperialism, Canadian nationalism, and constitutional centralism. This was highly successful until 1920, and to that point in history, the party was the most successful federal party in the Dominion.

As such, Canadian conservatism historically initially more closely resembled that which was practised in the United Kingdom and, to an extent, Europe, than in the United States. The &quot;Tory&quot; approach worked well for the party until 1917, when, as was common amongst 19th-century conservative movements, Canadian Tories opposed the rollback of government intervention in social and economic matters advocated by the liberals of the era. In contrast to &quot;American conservative&quot; counterparts, however, they did not undertake as dramatic an ideological turnaround in the first half of the 20th century by continuing to follow mercantilism and nascent notions of the welfare state.

Like their federal Liberal rivals, the party defined itself as a &quot;big tent&quot;, welcoming a broad variety of members who supported relatively loosely defined goals. Unlike the Liberal Party, there was a long history of ongoing factionalism within this tent. This factionalism arose from the party&#x27;s lack of electoral success, and because the party often reached out to particular political groups in order to garner enough support to topple the Liberals. These groups usually remained semi-autonomous blocs within the party, such as Quebec nationalists and western Canadian Reformers in the 1980s. In later years, observers generally grouped the PC Party&#x27;s core membership into two camps, &quot;Red Tories&quot; and &quot;Blue Tories&quot;.

Red Tories tend to be traditionally conservative, that is, &quot;Tory&quot; in the Disraelian sense in social policy, placing a high value on the principles of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;, communitarianism, and One nation conservatism—and were thus seen as moderate (in the context of classical economic thought) in their economic policy. For most of their history they were trade protectionists, engaging in free-trade economics in only a limited fashion, as in Empire Free-Trade. Historically they comprised the largest bloc of the original Canadian Conservative party. Notable Red Tories include John Farthing, George Grant, John Diefenbaker, E. Davie Fulton, Robert Stanfield, Dufferin Roblin, Dalton Camp, W. L. Morton, George A. Drew, Leslie Frost, John Robarts, William Davis, Peter Lougheed, Joe Clark and Flora MacDonald.

Blue Tories, on the other hand, were originally members of the Tory elite drawn from the commercial classes in Montreal and Toronto. Prior to World War II, they were generally conservative in social policy, and classically liberal in economic policy. From 1964 on, this cadre came to identify more with neo-liberal influences in the US Republican Party, as espoused by Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, and the Thatcherite leadership in the British Conservative Party, as represented by Sir Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher. They have come to be termed—in the Canadian lexicon—as neoconservatives. However, there are also Blue Tories who identify strongly with the Monarchy in Canada and other traditional institutions. In Canada, Blue Tories include Ralph Klein and Mike Harris.

From 1891 until the party&#x27;s dissolution, Red Tories generally dominated the highest rungs of the party and its leadership. The emerging neoconservatives of the 1970s were significantly reduced in numbers in the party by the late 1980s, and many of the disaffected drifted towards neoliberalism and parties with a neoconservative bent, such as the Reform Party of Canada. When the PC party held power at the federal level, it never truly embraced Reaganomics and its crusade against &quot;big government&quot; as vociferously as was done in the USA.

Canadian neoconservatives lean more towards individualism and economic liberalism. Support for the Canadian Alliance and its predecessor the Reform Party of Canada derived principally from this group, and that support carried forward into the new Conservative Party of Canada. The success of the neoconservative movement in using the label &quot;Conservative&quot; has brought into debate the very definition of conservatism in Canada today. Although adhering to economic philosophies similar to those originally advanced by 19th-century liberals (known confusingly as both neoliberalism and neoconservatism), the Canadian Alliance agreed to the name &quot;Conservative Party of Canada&quot; for the new party.

==Progressive Conservative history==

After a by-election defeat in 1942, a group of younger Conservatives from the Conservative Party of Canada met in Port Hope, Ontario, to develop a new Conservative policy they hoped would bring them out of the political wilderness. The participants, known as the Port Hopefuls, developed a program including many Conservative goals such as support for free enterprise and conscription. Yet the charter also included more radical policies, such as full-employment, low-cost housing, trade union rights, as well as a whole range of social security measures, including a government financed medicare system.

Although many Conservatives rejected the charter, the charter still influenced party decisions. Delegates at the convention drafted John Bracken as leader, who was not even a member of the party. Bracken supported the Port Hope Charter and insisted the party register this policy shift by changing its name to the Progressive Conservative Party.

In the early days of Canadian confederation, the party supported a mercantilist approach to economic development: export-led growth with high import barriers to protect local industry. The party was staunchly monarchist and supported playing a large role within the British Empire. It was seen by some French Canadians as supporting a policy of cultural assimilation.

The Conservative Party dominated Canadian politics for the nation&#x27;s first 30 years. In general, Canada&#x27;s political history has consisted of Tories alternating power with the Liberals, albeit often in minority governments supported by smaller parties.

After a long period of Liberal dominance following the Tories ill-fated depression era mandate from 1930 to 1935, John Diefenbaker won a minority government in 1957, followed by a sweeping electoral victory for the Tories in 1958. Diefenbaker was able to win most of the parliamentary seats in Western Canada, much of those in Ontario, and, with the support of the Union Nationale provincial government, a large number in Quebec. Diefenbaker attempted to pursue a policy of distancing Canada from the United States. His cabinet split over Diefenbaker&#x27;s refusal of American demands that Canada accept nuclear warheads for Bomarc missiles based in North Bay, Ontario, and La Macaza, Quebec. This split contributed to the Tory government&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s Liberals in the 1963 election.

Diefenbaker remained Progressive Conservative leader until 1967, when increasing unease at his erratic behaviour, authoritarian leadership, and perceived unelectability led party president Dalton Camp to call for and win a motion for a leadership review which resulted in the 1967 leadership convention where Nova Scotia Premier Robert Stanfield was elected out of a field of eleven candidates that included Diefenbaker and Manitoba Premier Duff Roblin. Despite being personally well-regarded, Stanfield struggled to make an impact against Pierre Trudeau, who became Prime Minister the following year. The 1972 election saw the party come within two seats of toppling the Liberal government, with their historical weakness in Quebec keeping them from victory, but a gaffe-ridden Tory campaign at the following election two years later saw the Liberals regain their parliamentary majority, leading to Stanfield&#x27;s resignation.

=== Clark-Mulroney era ===
Joe Clark took the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1976. He came to power in the 1979 election, defeating the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau and ending sixteen years of continuous Liberal rule. Taking office the day before his 40th birthday, Clark is the youngest person to become prime minister. His tenure was brief as he only won a minority government, and it was defeated on a motion of non-confidence pertaining to his 1979 budget. Clark&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party lost the 1980 election and Clark lost the leadership of the party to Brian Mulroney in 1983.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, following Quebec&#x27;s Quiet Revolution, the Progressive Conservatives recognized the need to increase their appeal to Canada&#x27;s francophone population. At the same time, the Tories moved away from economic nationalism towards a neoliberal platform. Both movements culminated with Brian Mulroney becoming prime minister after the election of 1984. He led the Tories to a record 211 seats, and a majority of seats in every province.

Mulroney had declared himself an opponent to free trade with the United States during the 1983 leadership campaign. But a growing continentalist sentiment among Canadian business leaders and the impact of the &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot; on Canadian conservative thought led Mulroney to embrace free trade. His government endorsed the recommendation of the 1985 Royal Commission on the Economic Union and Development Prospects for Canada that Canada pursue a free trade deal with the United States.
Traditionally, it had been the Liberal Party that held a position of continentalism and the Conservatives who had opposed free trade with the United States in favour of economic links with the United Kingdom. With the dissolution of the British Empire and the economic nationalism of the Liberal Party under Pierre Trudeau, the traditional positions of the two parties became reversed. It was with this background that Mulroney fought and won the 1988 election on the issue of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement.

Mulroney also made a promise to Quebecers, claiming that he would reform the Canadian Constitution so that Quebec would be willing to endorse the revised Constitution, which it did not in 1982, unlike Canada&#x27;s other provinces. To do this, Mulroney promised that he would give Quebec distinct society status within a federal Canada with greater autonomy. This helped Mulroney garner substantial support from Quebec nationalists including Lucien Bouchard who joined the Conservatives claiming that providing Quebec with autonomy would be acceptable for Quebec to remain within Canada.

Although the Progressive Conservative Party switched to neoliberalism, the party did retain its social progressive policies unlike other parties which advocated neoliberalism. Mulroney and the government pursued an aggressive environmental agenda under the aide of then-environmental policy advisor, present-day Green Party leader Elizabeth May. Mulroney and members of the U.S. government sparred over action on acid rain. In the end Mulroney managed to convince U.S. president Ronald Reagan to sign a treaty to reduce acid rain.

A number of economic and governance issues contributed to the fall of the Progressive Conservative party at the federal level in the 1993 federal election:
* Canada suffered its worst recession since the Second World War,
* Unemployment rose to the highest levels since the Great Depression,
* The federal government faced high and persistent deficits, and
* The Tories had introduced a much-hated new tax, the Goods and Services Tax.
* Extensive government corruption and accusations of corruption and government mismanagement were in the news, such as the Airbus affair and evidence showing Canadian peacekeepers maltreating Somalis, which resulted in the Somalia inquiry.
* During the election campaign the Tories used an attack ad against Liberal leader Jean Chrétien, which appeared to mock his odd facial expressions—which were the result of Bell&#x27;s palsy—and suggest he was unfit for the post of prime minister because of them.

The second major factor leading to the Mulroney government&#x27;s demise was that the party&#x27;s base in Quebec came from Quebec nationalists, who withdrew their support after the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Constitutional Accords. Many Quebec Tories, including a number of Members of Parliament (MPs), left the party to form the Bloc Québécois with like-minded Liberals.

The third major factor was the rise of western alienation in the four provinces of western Canada as a result of attempts by both Tories and Liberals to woo Quebec. Western Canadians turned their support to the Reform Party of Canada and later to its successor, the Canadian Alliance. Poor by-election results in Beaver River, Chambly, Laurier—Sainte-Marie, Oshawa and York North solidified the PC decline.

=== Post-Mulroney era and decline ===
Following Mulroney&#x27;s resignation, his successor as Tory leader and as prime minister was Kim Campbell, who led the party into the disastrous election of 1993. The Progressive Conservatives went from being the majority party to holding only two seats in the House of Commons, which was not enough to maintain official party status despite garnering 16% of the popular vote. It was the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level; the 151-seat loss far exceeded the 95 seats lost by the Liberals in 1984. The party&#x27;s western supporters transferred virtually &quot;en masse&quot; to Reform, most of its Quebec supporters split between the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois and the Liberals, and most of its Ontario and Atlantic supporters bolted for the Liberals. Even though the Progressive Conservatives finished third in the popular vote (just percentage points behind Reform), their support was spread out across the entire country and was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into more seats. By contrast, the Bloc managed to capture Official Opposition status with 54 seats despite running candidates only in Quebec, while Reform finished third in the seat count despite being virtually nonexistent east of Manitoba.

Campbell herself was defeated, as was every member of the Cabinet except Jean Charest, whom Campbell had defeated in the election to succeed Mulroney. Campbell resigned as party leader in December, and Charest, as the only remaining member of the previous Cabinet, was quickly appointed interim leader and confirmed in the post in 1995. The party continued to hold a majority of seats in the Senate until 1997, where Senator John Lynch-Staunton served as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Charest led the party back to official party status in the 1997 election, winning 20 seats. With the exception of one seat each in Ontario and Manitoba, the rest of the seats were all in the Maritimes and Quebec. However, the PCs never won more than 20 seats again, and only two west of Quebec (not counting by-elections and switches from other parties).

===Merger with Alliance===
The rise of the Reform Party/Canadian Alliance was doubtless damaging to the Tories, though there remains some debate as to the precise degree. Many observers argue that for over ten years, from 1993 to 2004, the &quot;conservative&quot; vote was split between the two parties, allowing Liberal candidates to win ridings that were previously considered safe for the Tories, made possible by a first-past-the-post electoral system. This assessment led to the growth of the United Alternative movements of the late 1990s. Others insisted that a legitimate ideological gulf existed between the more ideological Alliance and the more moderate Red Tory-influenced PC Party, pointing to surveys that indicated many Tory voters would rather select the Liberals as their second choice than the Alliance. This seemed to be particularly born out in Ontario. The Liberals won all but one seat in that province in 1993 and 1997, and all but two in 2000—an era that was dominated by the provincial Tories. This was largely because many former bellwether ridings in suburban Toronto (known as &quot;the 905&quot;, after its area code) turned almost solidly Liberal for most of the 1990s at the federal level while supporting the Tories at the provincial level.

Charest stepped down from the leadership in 1998 to become leader of the Quebec Liberal Party. Former leader Joe Clark returned to the post in a vote in which all party members were eligible to cast ballots, instead of a traditional leadership convention. A point system allocated each riding 100 points to be distributed among the candidates by proportional representation according to votes cast by party members in the riding. (This same system was used by the Conservative Party of Canada in 2004.) In the 2000 election Clark was able to garner the 12 seats necessary for official party status, but no more.

Clark realized that as long as the centre-right vote was divided, there was no chance of dislodging the Liberals, but he wanted a merger on his own terms. He got his chance in 2001, when several dissident Alliance MPs, the most prominent one being Alliance deputy leader and party matriarch Deborah Grey, left the Alliance caucus. The dissidents felt that Alliance leader Stockwell Day hadn&#x27;t learned from mistakes made in the last election. While some of them rejoined the Alliance later, seven of them, led by Chuck Strahl of British Columbia and including Grey, refused and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus. The DRC quickly entered a coalition with the Progressive Conservatives, which lasted until 2002 when Stephen Harper ousted Day as Alliance leader. Harper wanted a closer union with the PCs, but Clark turned the offer down, and all but two of the DRC members rejoined the Alliance. One of the two, Inky Mark, eventually joined the PCs. Two by-election victories later in 2002 increased the PC caucus to 15 members and fourth place in the Commons. Clark, however, was unable to gain any ground in Ontario, and resigned on August 6, 2002.
On May 31, 2003, Peter MacKay won the party leadership after securing the endorsement of controversial fellow leadership candidate David Orchard, an outspoken opponent of free trade who wanted to return the party to its traditional economic nationalist roots. Orchard&#x27;s endorsement of MacKay was predicated on four bullet points laid out in the Orchard-MacKay agreement, one of which expressly forbade the merger of the PC Party of Canada with the Canadian Alliance. After only a few months as party leader though, MacKay reneged on his promise and proceeded to negotiate a merger with the Alliance, which he announced had occurred on October 15, 2003. The two parties, it seemed, united to form a new party called the Conservative Party of Canada. The union was ratified on December 5 and 6 in a process conducted by each of the parties, and the new Conservative Party was formally registered on December 7. The merger prompted Clark to remark, &quot;Some equate it to a death in the family. I regard it rather as a death of the family.&quot; On March 20, 2004, former Alliance leader Harper was elected leader of the new party and appointed MacKay as his deputy.

==Rump PC caucus==
===House of Commons===
Following the merger, a rump Progressive Conservative caucus remained in Parliament, consisting of individuals who declined to join the new Conservative Party. In the House of Commons, Joe Clark, André Bachand and John Herron sat as PC members. In the 2004 election, Bachand and Clark did not run for re-election, and Herron ran as a Liberal, losing to Rob Moore in his riding of Fundy—Royal. Scott Brison, who had joined the Liberal caucus immediately upon departing the Conservative Party, was reelected as a Liberal in the 2004 election. After being expelled from the Conservative Party caucus in June 2007, Nova Scotia MP Bill Casey designated himself as an &quot;Independent Progressive Conservative&quot;.

===Senate===
In the Senate, William Doody, Lowell Murray and Norman Atkins also declined to join the new party, and continued to sit as Progressive Conservative senators. On March 24, 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin appointed nine new senators, two of whom, Nancy Ruth and Elaine McCoy, were designated as Progressive Conservatives. Ruth subsequently left to sit with the Conservative Party. The death of Senator Doody on December 27, 2005, and the mandatory retirement of Norman Atkins on June 27, 2009, and Lowell Murray on September 26, 2011, left McCoy, the youngest of the five, as the sole Progressive Conservative in the Senate and the last sitting PC in either chamber of Parliament until February 11, 2013, when she chose to change her designation to &quot;Independent Progressive Conservative&quot;. McCoy changed her designation to &quot;Independent&quot; on February 17, 2016, thus bringing to an end the presence of Progressive Conservatives in the Parliament of Canada.

==Progressive Canadian Party==

On January 9, 2004, a group claiming to be loyal to the Progressive Conservative Party and opposed to the merger, which they characterized as an Alliance takeover, filed application with the Chief Electoral Officer to register a party called the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. The application was refused on the grounds that the name could no longer be utilized. The group resubmitted with the name Progressive Canadian Party, and a new &quot;PC Party&quot; was recognized by Elections Canada on March 26. It secured sufficient backing to be registered as an official party on May 29. It was led by former Progressive Conservative MP Joe Hueglin of Ontario.

The Progressive Canadian party aimed to be perceived as the successor party to the Progressive Conservatives. However, it did not enjoy broad support among former Progressive Conservatives. In particular, no prominent anti-merger Progressive Conservatives such as Joe Clark or David Orchard were associated with the Progressive Canadian Party, nor were any sitting MPs or senators. The most prominent members to join were two 1970s and 1980s era politicians: former cabinet minister Sinclair Stevens and former junior cabinet minister, Heward Grafftey, who polled near or below Craig Chandler in the final PC Party leadership race. It was deregistered by Elections Canada in late 2019.

<text>Fail Safe is a 1964 Cold War thriller film directed by Sidney Lumet, based on the 1962 novel of the same name by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler. The film follows a crisis caused by a critical error that sends a group of U.S. bombers to destroy Moscow, and the ensuing attempts to stop the bomber group before it can deploy a nuclear first strike. The film features performances by actors Henry Fonda, Dan O&#x27;Herlihy, Walter Matthau, Frank Overton, Fritz Weaver, Edward Binns, Larry Hagman, Sorrell Booke, Dana Elcar and Dom DeLuise.

In 2000, the novel was adapted again as a televised play starring George Clooney, Richard Dreyfuss and Noah Wyle, and broadcast live in black and white on CBS.

==Plot==
United States Air Force General Black has been having recurring dreams in which a Spanish matador kills a bull before a cheering crowd. Black flies to Washington, D.C., to attend a conference led by Dr. Groeteschele, a political scientist renowned for his expertise on the politics of nuclear weapons, a character based on Herman Kahn.

Groeteschele is a fervent anti-communist. At a dinner party the previous evening, he dismisses the fears that such a war would destroy the human race. To Groeteschele, nuclear war, like any other war, must have a victor and a loser, and the millions who might die in such a war are the price to be paid to end the Soviet threat.

USAF early warning radar indicates that an unidentified aircraft has intruded into U.S. airspace. Shortly after, the intruder is identified as an off-course civilian airliner. However, a computer error causes one U.S. bomber group, Group 6, to erroneously receive apparently valid orders for a nuclear attack on Moscow. Attempts to rescind this order fail because a new Soviet countermeasure jams U.S. radio communications. Colonel Jack Grady, the group&#x27;s commander, obeys the order, and Group 6 starts flying their &quot;Vindicator&quot; bombers over the Arctic toward Moscow.

The President of the United States attempts to recall the bombers or shoot them down. Groeteschele is called to advise the President. The military—including Black—warns the President that the Soviets will retaliate with everything they have, and Groeteschele argues for a full-scale attack to reduce that. U.S. fighters scramble to intercept the Vindicators, but, needing to use their afterburners to catch up, they run out of fuel before they or their missiles can reach Group 6, and plunge into the Arctic waters.

Communications are opened with the Soviet Premier. The jamming ceases, but the crew follows their training, dismissing the counter-orders as a Soviet ruse. General Bogan advises the Soviets on how to trigger the Vindicators&#x27; defense missiles. The President struggles to find a solution that will avert a nuclear holocaust. He orders a U.S. nuclear bomber to fly toward New York City to bomb it if necessary, trading the largest American city for the largest Soviet city, despite knowing that the First Lady is there.

The Soviets destroy most of Group 6, but miss both Grady&#x27;s plane and a second decoy plane, carrying only defensive weapons. The second plane draws Soviet aircraft away from Grady, despite Bogan&#x27;s desperate pleas to the Soviets, allowing Grady to evade their defenses.

The Soviets, in desperation, fire all their weapons in the path of the remaining Vindicator. As Grady nears Moscow, the Americans are finally able to reach him via radio. Both the President and Grady&#x27;s own wife desperately urge him to stop the attack. As Grady wavers, a salvo of Soviet missiles targets his plane. Grady decoys them with the last of his defensive missiles, causing them to detonate far above him, although Grady knows that his crew has received a fatal dose of radiation. Grady dismisses the pleas as a trick.

The President remains in contact with the U.S. ambassador in Moscow until the telephone line abruptly cuts off with a loud squeal. He orders General Black, whose wife and children live in New York City, to fly over the city and bomb it, using the Empire State Building as ground zero. Black obeys, taking full responsibility by dropping the bomb himself, then dies by suicide with a vial of poison hidden in his flight suit. As he dies, he calls out to his doomed wife, telling her that he has at last learned the meaning of his recurring dream: &quot;The Matador, the Matador, the Matador ... me ... me&quot;.

Meanwhile, New Yorkers go about their daily lives, unaware of the coming disaster, at which point, the nuclear bomb explodes.

==Production==
The film was shot in black and white, in a dramatic, theatrical style, with claustrophobic close-ups, sharp shadows and ponderous silences between several characters. Except for radio background during a scene at an Air Force base in Alaska, there is no original music score (only the electronic sound effects act as the film&#x27;s main and end title music). With few exceptions, the action takes place largely in the White House underground bunker, the Pentagon war conference room, the Strategic Air Command war room, and a single bomber cockpit (a &quot;Vindicator bomber&quot;). Shots of normal daily life are seen only after the opening credits and in the final scene depicting an ordinary New York City day, its residents entirely unsuspecting of their imminent destruction, each scene ending with a freeze-frame shot at the moment of impact.

The character of Groeteschele was inspired, according to Lumet&#x27;s audio commentary on the film, by military strategist Herman Kahn.

The &quot;Vindicator&quot; bombers (an invention of the novelists) are sometimes represented in the film with stock footage of Convair B-58 Hustlers. Fighters sent to attack the bombers are illustrated by film clips of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, Dassault Mirage III and McDonnell F-101 Voodoo. Stock footage was used because the Air Force declined to cooperate in the production, disliking the premise of a lack of control over nuclear strike forces. The scene depicting bombers taking off was stock footage of a single B-58 takeoff, edited to look like several bombers taking off in succession. A nightmare quality is imparted to many of the flying sequences by depicting the planes in photographic negative. In several of the negative sequences, the &quot;Soviet interceptors&quot; are actually French-built Mirage fighters with Israeli markings.

==Reception==
When &quot;Fail Safe&quot; opened in October 1964, it garnered excellent reviews, but its box-office performance was poor. Its failure rested with the similarity between it and the nuclear war satire &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, which had appeared in theaters first, in January 1964. Still, the film was later lauded as a Cold War thriller. The novel sold well for the remainder of the 20th century, and the film was given high marks for retaining the essence of the novel. Over the years, both the novel and the movie were well received for their depiction of a nuclear crisis, despite many critical reviews rejecting the notion that a breakdown in communication could result in the erroneous &quot;Go&quot; command depicted in the novel and the movie.

The film was nominated at the 1966 BAFTA Awards for the United Nations Award category.

==Lawsuit==
&quot;Fail Safe&quot; and &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; were both produced in the period after the Cuban Missile Crisis, when people became more sensitive to the threat of nuclear war. &quot;Fail Safe&quot; so closely resembled Peter George&#x27;s novel &quot;Red Alert&quot;, on which &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; was based, that &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; screenwriter/director Stanley Kubrick and George filed a copyright infringement lawsuit. The case was settled out of court. The result of the settlement was that Columbia Pictures, which had financed and was distributing &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, also bought &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, which had been an independently financed production. Kubrick insisted that the studio release his movie first.

<text>The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC; , ) is the highest court in the judicial system of Canada. It comprises nine justices, whose decisions are the ultimate application of Canadian law, and grants permission to between 40 and 75 litigants each year to appeal decisions rendered by provincial, territorial and federal appellate courts. The Supreme Court is bijural, hearing cases from two major legal traditions (common law and civil law) and bilingual, hearing cases in both official languages of Canada (English and French).

The effects of any judicial decision on the common law, on the interpretation of statutes, or on any other application of law, can, in effect, be nullified by legislation, unless the particular decision of the court in question involves application of the Canadian Constitution, in which case, the decision (in most cases) is completely binding on the legislative branch. This is especially true of decisions which touch upon the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which cannot be altered by the legislative branch unless the decision is overridden pursuant to section 33 (the &quot;notwithstanding clause&quot;).

==History==

The creation of the Supreme Court of Canada was provided for by the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;, renamed in 1982 the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. The first bills for the creation of a federal supreme court, introduced in the Parliament of Canada in 1869 and in 1870, were withdrawn. It was not until 8 April 1875 that a bill was finally passed providing for the creation of a Supreme Court of Canada.

However, prior to 1949, the Supreme Court did not constitute the court of last resort: litigants could appeal SCC decisions to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London. Some cases could bypass the Supreme Court and go directly to the Judicial Committee from the provincial courts of appeal. The Supreme Court formally became the court of last resort for criminal appeals in 1933 and for all other appeals in 1949. Cases that were begun prior to those dates remained appealable to the Judicial Committee, and the last case on appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada was not decided until 1959.

The increase in the importance of the Supreme Court was mirrored by the numbers of its members; it was established first with six judges, and these were augmented by an additional member in 1927. In 1949, the bench reached its current composition of nine justices.

Prior to 1949, most of the appointees to the court owed their position to political patronage. Each judge had strong ties to the party in power at the time of their appointment. In 1973, the appointment of a constitutional law professor Bora Laskin as chief justice represented a major turning point for the court. Laskin&#x27;s federalist and liberal views were shared by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who recommended Laskin&#x27;s appointment to the court, but from that appointment onward appointees increasingly either came from academic backgrounds or were well-respected practitioners with several years&#x27; experience in appellate courts.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, greatly expanded the role of the court in Canadian society by the addition of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which greatly broadened the scope of judicial review. The evolution from the court under Chief Justice Brian Dickson (1984–1990) through to that of Antonio Lamer (1990–2000) witnessed a continuing vigour in the protection of civil liberties. Lamer&#x27;s criminal law background proved an influence on the number of criminal cases heard by the Court during his time as chief justice. Nonetheless, the Lamer court was more conservative with &quot;Charter&quot; rights, with only about a 1% success rate for &quot;Charter&quot; claimants.

Lamer was succeeded as the chief justice by Beverley McLachlin in January 2000. She was the first woman to hold that position. McLachlin&#x27;s appointment resulted in a more centrist and unified court. Dissenting and concurring opinions were fewer than during the Dickson and Lamer courts. With the 2005 appointments of puisne justices Louise Charron and Rosalie Abella, the court became the world&#x27;s most gender-balanced national high court with four of its nine members being female. Justice Marie Deschamps&#x27; retirement on 7 August 2012 caused the number to fall to three; however, the appointment of Suzanne Côté on 1 December 2014 restored the number to four. After serving on the court for ( as chief justice), McLachlin retired in December 2017. Her successor as the chief justice is Richard Wagner.

Along with the German Federal Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights, the Supreme Court of Canada is among the most frequently cited courts in the world.

==Canadian judiciary==

The structure of the Canadian court system is pyramidal, a broad base being formed by the various provincial and territorial courts whose judges are appointed by the provincial or territorial governments. At the next level are the provincial and territorial superior trial courts, where judges are appointed by the federal government. Judgments from the superior courts may be appealed to a still higher level, the provincial or territorial superior courts of appeal.

Several federal courts also exist: the Tax Court, the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal, and the Court Martial Appeal Court. Unlike the provincial superior courts, which exercise inherent or general jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of federal courts and provincially appointed provincial courts are limited by statute. In all, there are over 1,000 federally appointed judges at various levels across Canada.

===Appellate process===
The Supreme Court rests at the apex of the judicial pyramid. This institution hears appeals from the provincial courts of last resort, usually the provincial or territorial courts of appeal, and the Federal Court of Appeal, although in some matters appeals come straight from the trial courts, as in the case of publication bans and other orders that are otherwise not appealable.

In most cases, permission to appeal must first be obtained from the court. Motions for leave to appeal to the court are generally heard by a panel of three of its judges and a simple majority is determinative. By convention, this panel never explains why it grants or refuses leave in any particular case, but the court typically hears cases of national importance or where the case allows it to settle an important issue of law. Leave is rarely granted, meaning that for most litigants, provincial courts of appeal are courts of last resort. But leave to appeal is not required for some cases, primarily indictable criminal cases in which at least one appellate judge (on the relevant provincial court of appeal) dissented on a point of law, and appeals from provincial reference cases.

A final source of cases is the power of the federal government to submit reference cases. In such cases, the Supreme Court is required to give an opinion on questions referred to it by the Governor in Council (the Cabinet). However, in many cases, including the most recent same-sex marriage reference, the Supreme Court has declined to answer a question from the Cabinet. In that case, the court said it would not decide if same-sex marriages were required by the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, because the government had announced it would change the law regardless of its opinion, and subsequently did.

===Constitutional interpretation===

The Supreme Court thus performs a unique function. It can be asked by the Governor-in-Council to hear references considering important questions of law. Such referrals may concern the constitutionality or interpretation of federal or provincial legislation, or the division of powers between federal and provincial spheres of government. Any point of law may be referred in this manner. However, the Court is not often called upon to hear references. References have been used to re-examine criminal convictions that have concerned the country as in the cases of David Milgaard and Steven Truscott.

The Supreme Court has the ultimate power of judicial review over Canadian federal and provincial laws&#x27; constitutional validity. If a federal or provincial law has been held contrary to the division of power provisions of one of the various constitution acts, the legislature or parliament must either live with the result, amend the law so that it complies, or obtain an amendment to the constitution. If a law is declared contrary to certain sections of the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, Parliament or the provincial legislatures may make that particular law temporarily valid again against by using the &quot;override power&quot; of the notwithstanding clause. In one case, the Quebec National Assembly invoked this power to override a Supreme Court decision (&quot;Ford v Quebec (AG)&quot;) that held that one of Quebec&#x27;s language laws banning the display of English commercial signs was inconsistent with the &quot;Charter&quot;. Saskatchewan has also used it to uphold its labour laws. This override power can be exercised for five years, after which time the override must be renewed or the decision comes into force.

In some cases, the court may stay the effect of its judgments so that unconstitutional laws continue in force for a period of time. Usually, this is done to give Parliament or a legislature sufficient time to enact a new replacement scheme of legislation. For example, in &quot;Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights&quot;, the court struck down Manitoba&#x27;s laws because they were not enacted in the French language, as required by the Constitution. However, the Court stayed its judgment for five years to give Manitoba time to re-enact all its legislation in French. It turned out five years was insufficient so the court was asked, and agreed, to give more time.

Constitutional questions may, of course, also be raised in the normal case of appeals involving individual litigants, governments, government agencies or Crown corporations. In such cases the federal and provincial governments must be notified of any constitutional questions and may intervene to submit a brief and attend oral argument at the court. Usually the other governments are given the right to argue their case in the court, although on rare occasions this has been curtailed and prevented by order of one of the court&#x27;s judges.

==Sessions==

The Supreme Court sits in three sessions in each calendar year. The first session begins on the fourth Tuesday in January, the second session on the fourth Tuesday in April, and the third session on the first Tuesday in October. The Court determines how long each session will be. Hearings only take place in Ottawa, although litigants can present oral arguments from remote locations by means of a video-conference system. Hearings are open to the public. Most hearings are taped for delayed telecast in both of Canada&#x27;s official languages. When in session, the court sits Monday to Friday, hearing two appeals a day. A quorum consists of five members for appeals, but a panel of nine justices hears most cases.

On the bench, the chief justice of Canada or, in his or her absence, the senior puisne justice, presides from the centre chair with the other justices seated to his or her right and left by order of seniority of appointment. At sittings, the justices usually appear in black silk robes but they wear their ceremonial robes of bright scarlet trimmed with Canadian white mink in court on special occasions and in the Senate at the opening of each new session of Parliament.

Counsel appearing before the court may use either English or French. The judges can also use either English or French. There is simultaneous translation available to the judges, counsel and to members of the public who are in the audience, or watching by livestream.

The decision of the court is sometimes rendered orally at the conclusion of the hearing. In these cases, the court may simply refer to the decision of the court below to explain its own reasons. In other cases, the court may announce its decision at the conclusion of the hearing, with reasons to follow. As well, in some cases, the court may not call on counsel for the respondent, if it has not been convinced by the arguments of counsel for the appellant. In very rare cases, the court may not call on counsel for the appellant and instead calls directly on counsel for the respondent. However, in most cases, the court hears from all counsel and then reserves judgment to enable the justices to write considered reasons. Decisions of the court need not be unanimousa majority may decide, with dissenting reasons given by the minority. Justices may write separate or joint opinions for any case.

A puisne justice of the Supreme Court is referred to as &quot;The Honourable Mr/Madam Justice&quot; and the chief justice as &quot;Right Honourable&quot;. At one time, judges were addressed as &quot;My Lord&quot; or &quot;My Lady&quot; during sessions of the court, but it has since discouraged this style of address and has directed lawyers to use the simpler &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Mr Justice&quot; or &quot;Madam Justice&quot;. The designation &quot;My Lord/My Lady&quot; continues in many provincial superior courts and in the Federal Court of Canada and Federal Court of Appeal, where it is optional.

Every four years, the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission makes recommendations to the federal government about the salaries for federally appointed judges, including the judges of the Supreme Court. That recommendation is not legally binding on the federal government, but the federal government is generally required to comply with the recommendation unless there is a very good reason to not do so. The chief justice receives $370,300 while the puisne justices receive $342,800 annually.

==Appointment of justices==

Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada are appointed on the advice of the prime minister.

The &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot; limits eligibility for appointment to persons who have been judges of a superior court or members of the bar for ten or more years. Members of the bar or superior judiciary of Quebec, by law, must hold three of the nine positions on the Supreme Court of Canada. This is justified on the basis that Quebec uses civil law, rather than common law, as in the rest of the country. As explained in the reasons in &quot;Reference Re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6&quot;, sitting judges of the Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal cannot be appointed to any of Quebec&#x27;s three seats. By convention, the remaining six positions are divided in the following manner: three from Ontario; two from the western provinces, typically one from British Columbia and one from the prairie provinces, which rotate among themselves (although Alberta is known to cause skips in the rotation); and one from the Atlantic provinces, almost always from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. Parliament and the provincial governments have no constitutional role in such appointments, sometimes a point of contention.

In 2006, an interview phase by an committee of members of Parliament was added. Justice Marshall Rothstein became the first justice to undergo the new process. The prime minister still has the final say on who becomes the candidate that is recommended to the governor general for appointment to the court. The government proposed an interview phase again in 2008, but a general election and minority parliament intervened with delays such that the Prime Minister recommended Justice Cromwell after consulting the leader of the Opposition.

As of August 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opened the process of application to change from the above-noted appointment process. Under the revised process, &quot;[any] Canadian lawyer or judge who fits specified criteria can apply for a seat on the Supreme Court, through the Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs.&quot; Functional bilingualism is now a requirement.

Justices were originally allowed to remain on the bench for life, but in 1927 a mandatory retirement age of 75 was instituted. They may choose to retire earlier, but can only be removed involuntarily before that age by a vote of the Senate and House of Commons.

==Current members==
The current chief justice of Canada is Richard Wagner. He was appointed to the court as a puisne judge on 5 October 2012 and appointed chief justice, 18 December 2017. The nine justices of the Wagner Court are:

===Length of tenure===
The following graphical timeline depicts the length of each current justice&#x27;s tenure on the Supreme Court (not their position in the court&#x27;s order of precedence) as of .
Andromache Karakatsanis has had the longest tenure of any of the current members of the court, having been appointed in October 2011. Richard Wagner&#x27;s cumulative tenure is — as puisne justice, and as chief justice. Mary Moreau has the briefest tenure, having been appointed ago. The length of tenure for the other justices are: Suzanne Côté, ; Malcom Rowe, ; Sheilah Martin, ; Nicholas Kasirer, ; Mahmud Jamal, ; and Michelle O&#x27;Bonsawin, .

==Rules of the court==
The &quot;Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada&quot; are located on the laws-lois.justice.gc.ca website, as well as in the Canada Gazette, as SOR/2002-216 (plus amendments), made pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the &quot;Supreme Court Act&quot;. Fees and taxes are stipulated near the end.

==Law clerks==
Since 1967, the court has hired law clerks to assist in legal research. Between 1967 and 1982, each puisne justice was assisted by one law clerk and the chief justice had two. From 1982, the number was increased to two law clerks for each justice. Currently, each justice has up to three law clerks.

==Building==

The Supreme Court of Canada Building () is located just west of Parliament Hill, at 301 Wellington Street. It is situated on a bluff high above the Ottawa River in downtown Ottawa and is home to the Supreme Court of Canada. It also contains two courtrooms used by the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal.

The building was designed by Ernest Cormier and is known for its Art Deco style—including two candelabrum-style fluted metal lamp standards that flank the entrance and the marble walls and floors of the lobby—contrasting with the châteauesque roof. Construction began in 1939, with the cornerstone laid by Queen Elizabeth, consort of King George VI and later known as the Queen Mother. In her speech, she said, &quot;perhaps it is not inappropriate that this task should be performed by a woman; for woman&#x27;s position in a civilized society has depended upon the growth of law.&quot; The court began hearing cases in the new building by January 1946.

In 2000, the edifice was named by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada as one of the top 500 buildings produced in Canada during the last millennium. Canada Post issued a commemorative stamp on 9 June 2011, as part of the Architecture Art Déco series.
Two flagstaffs have been erected in front of the building. A flag on one is flown daily, while the other is hoisted only on those days when the court is in session. Also located on the grounds are several statues, including one of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, by Elek Imredy in 1976, and two—Veritas (Truth) and Justitia (Justice)—by Canadian sculptor Walter S. Allward. Inside there are busts of several chief justices: John Robert Cartwright (1967–1970), Bora Laskin (1973–1983), Brian Dickson (1984–1990), and Antonio Lamer (1990–2000), all sculpted by Kenneth Phillips Jarvis, a retired Under Treasurer of the Law Society of Upper Canada.

The court was previously housed in the Railway Committee Room and a number of other committee rooms in the Centre Block on Parliament Hill. The court then sat in the Old Supreme Court building on Bank Street, between 1889 and 1945. That structure was demolished in 1955 and the site used as parking for Parliament Hill.

<text>Lincoln is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,013.

==History==
Meriwether Lewis passed through the area on his return to St. Louis in 1806, following the famous &quot;River of the Road to the Buffalo&quot; created by Native Americans centuries before. Gold discoveries in the mid-1860s brought miners to a number of camps in the area, and Lincoln was eventually created when nearby Lincoln Gulch was abandoned in favor of the town&#x27;s present location. Recreational, logging and mining activities along the Blackfoot River in the early 20th century made it a convenient commercial center. Nearby wilderness areas continue to attract visitors and residents.

In 1865, David Culp and Thomas Patterson staked a claim in what they designated Abe Lincoln Gulch in honor of the recently assassinated president. Word broke out, gold-seekers descended upon the area, and a small community soon formed at the mouth of the gulch with the abbreviated name – Lincoln.

<doc id="123495" wikidata="Q1425077" url="?curid=123495" title="Spectral theorem">
<text>In linear algebra and functional analysis, a spectral theorem is a result about when a linear operator or matrix can be diagonalized (that is, represented as a diagonal matrix in some basis). This is extremely useful because computations involving a diagonalizable matrix can often be reduced to much simpler computations involving the corresponding diagonal matrix. The concept of diagonalization is relatively straightforward for operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces but requires some modification for operators on infinite-dimensional spaces. In general, the spectral theorem identifies a class of linear operators that can be modeled by multiplication operators, which are as simple as one can hope to find. In more abstract language, the spectral theorem is a statement about commutative C*-algebras. See also spectral theory for a historical perspective.

Examples of operators to which the spectral theorem applies are self-adjoint operators or more generally normal operators on Hilbert spaces.

The spectral theorem also provides a canonical decomposition, called the [[eigendecomposition of a matrix|spectral decomposition]], of the underlying vector space on which the operator acts.

Augustin-Louis Cauchy proved the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices, i.e., that every real, symmetric matrix is diagonalizable. In addition, Cauchy was the first to be systematic about determinants. The spectral theorem as generalized by John von Neumann is today perhaps the most important result of operator theory.

This article mainly focuses on the simplest kind of spectral theorem, that for a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space. However, as noted above, the spectral theorem also holds for normal operators on a Hilbert space.

== Finite-dimensional case ==
=== Hermitian maps and Hermitian matrices ===
We begin by considering a Hermitian matrix on formula_1 (but the following discussion will be adaptable to the more restrictive case of symmetric matrices on We consider a Hermitian map on a finite-dimensional complex inner product space endowed with a positive definite sesquilinear inner product formula_2 The Hermitian condition on formula_3 means that for all ,
formula_4

An equivalent condition is that , where is the Hermitian conjugate of . In the case that is identified with a Hermitian matrix, the matrix of is equal to its conjugate transpose. (If is a real matrix, then this is equivalent to , that is, is a symmetric matrix.)

This condition implies that all eigenvalues of a Hermitian map are real: To see this, it is enough to apply it to the case when is an eigenvector. (Recall that an eigenvector of a linear map is a non-zero vector such that for some scalar . The value is the corresponding eigenvalue. Moreover, the eigenvalues are roots of the characteristic polynomial.)

We provide a sketch of a proof for the case where the underlying field of scalars is the complex numbers.

By the fundamental theorem of algebra, applied to the characteristic polynomial of , there is at least one complex eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector which must by definition be non-zero. Then since 
formula_5 
we find that is real. Now consider the space formula_6 the orthogonal complement of By Hermiticity, formula_7 is an invariant subspace of . To see that, consider any formula_8 so that formula_9 by definition of formula_10 To satisfy invariance, we need to check if formula_11 This is true because formula_12 Applying the same argument to formula_7 shows that has at least one real eigenvalue formula_14 and corresponding eigenvector formula_15 This can be used to build another invariant subspace formula_16 Finite induction then finishes the proof.

The matrix representation of in a basis of eigenvectors is diagonal, and by the construction the proof gives a basis of mutually orthogonal eigenvectors; by choosing them to be unit vectors one obtains an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. can be written as a linear combination of pairwise orthogonal projections, called its spectral decomposition. Let
formula_17
be the eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue formula_18 Note that the definition does not depend on any choice of specific eigenvectors. In general, is the orthogonal direct sum of the spaces formula_19 where the formula_20 ranges over the spectrum of formula_21 

When the matrix being decomposed is Hermitian, the spectral decomposition is a special case of the Schur decomposition (see the proof in case of normal matrices below).

=== Spectral decomposition and the singular value decomposition ===

The spectral decomposition is a special case of the singular value decomposition, which states that any matrix formula_22 can be expressed as 
formula_23 where formula_24 and formula_25 are unitary matrices and formula_26 is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries of formula_27 are uniquely determined by formula_3 and are known as the singular values of formula_21 If formula_3 is Hermitian, then formula_31 and formula_32 which implies formula_33 
=== Normal matrices ===

The spectral theorem extends to a more general class of matrices. Let be an operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space. is said to be normal if 

One can show that is normal if and only if it is unitarily diagonalizable using the Schur decomposition. That is, any matrix can be written as where is unitary and is upper triangular.
If is normal, then one sees that Therefore, must be diagonal since a normal upper triangular matrix is diagonal (see normal matrix). The converse is obvious.

In other words, is normal if and only if there exists a unitary matrix such that
formula_34
where is a diagonal matrix. Then, the entries of the diagonal of are the eigenvalues of . The column vectors of are the eigenvectors of and they are orthonormal. Unlike the Hermitian case, the entries of need not be real.

== Compact self-adjoint operators ==

In the more general setting of Hilbert spaces, which may have an infinite dimension, the statement of the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators is virtually the same as in the finite-dimensional case.

As for Hermitian matrices, the key point is to prove the existence of at least one nonzero eigenvector. One cannot rely on determinants to show existence of eigenvalues, but one can use a maximization argument analogous to the variational characterization of eigenvalues. 

If the compactness assumption is removed, then it is &quot;not&quot; true that every self-adjoint operator has eigenvectors. For example, the multiplication operator formula_35 on formula_36 which takes each formula_37 to formula_38 is bounded and self-adjoint, but has no eigenvectors. However, its spectrum, suitably defined, is still equal to formula_39, see spectrum of bounded operator.

== Bounded self-adjoint operators ==
===Possible absence of eigenvectors===

The next generalization we consider is that of bounded self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. Such operators may have no eigenvectors: for instance let be the operator of multiplication by on formula_36, that is,
formula_41

This operator does not have any eigenvectors &quot;in&quot; formula_36, though it does have eigenvectors in a larger space. Namely the distribution formula_43, where formula_44 is the Dirac delta function, is an eigenvector when construed in an appropriate sense. The Dirac delta function is however not a function in the classical sense and does not lie in the Hilbert space or any other Banach space. Thus, the delta-functions are &quot;generalized eigenvectors&quot; of formula_45 but not eigenvectors in the usual sense. 

===Spectral subspaces and projection-valued measures===

In the absence of (true) eigenvectors, one can look for a &quot;spectral subspace&quot; consisting of an &quot;almost eigenvector&quot;, i.e, a closed subspace formula_46 of formula_47 associated with a Borel set formula_48 in the spectrum of formula_45. This subspace can be thought of as the closed span of generalized eigenvectors for formula_45 with eigen&quot;values&quot; in formula_51. In the above example, where formula_52 we might consider the subspace of functions supported on a small interval formula_53 inside formula_39. This space is invariant under formula_45 and for any formula_56 in this subspace, formula_57 is very close to formula_58. Each subspace, in turn, is encoded by the associated projection operator, and the collection of all the subspaces is then represented by a projection-valued measure. 

One formulation of the spectral theorem expresses the operator as an integral of the coordinate function over the operator&#x27;s spectrum formula_59 with respect to a projection-valued measure.
formula_60When the self-adjoint operator in question is compact, this version of the spectral theorem reduces to something similar to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem above, except that the operator is expressed as a finite or countably infinite linear combination of projections, that is, the measure consists only of atoms.
===Multiplication operator version===
An alternative formulation of the spectral theorem says that every bounded self-adjoint operator is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator, a relatively simple type of operator.Multiplication operators are a direct generalization of diagonal matrices. A finite-dimensional Hermitian vector space formula_47 may be coordinatized as the space of functions formula_62 from a basis formula_63 to the complex numbers, so that the formula_63-coordinates of a vector are the values of the corresponding function formula_56. The finite-dimensional spectral theorem for a self-adjoint operator formula_66 states that there exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors formula_63, so that the inner product becomes the dot product with respect to the formula_63-coordinates: thus formula_47 is isomorphic to formula_70 for the discrete unit measure formula_71 on formula_63. Also formula_45 is unitarily equivalent to the multiplication operator formula_74, where formula_75 is the eigenvalue of formula_76: that is, formula_45 multiplies each formula_63-coordinate by the corresponding eigenvalue formula_75, the action of a diagonal matrix. Finally, the operator norm formula_80 is equal to the magnitude of the largest eigenvector formula_81.

The spectral theorem is the beginning of the vast research area of functional analysis called operator theory; see also spectral measure.

There is also an analogous spectral theorem for bounded normal operators on Hilbert spaces. The only difference in the conclusion is that now &quot;formula_82&quot; may be complex-valued. 

===Direct integrals===
There is also a formulation of the spectral theorem in terms of direct integrals. It is similar to the multiplication-operator formulation, but more canonical.

Let formula_45 be a bounded self-adjoint operator and let formula_84 be the spectrum of formula_45. The direct-integral formulation of the spectral theorem associates two quantities to formula_45. First, a measure formula_71 on formula_84, and second, a family of Hilbert spaces formula_89 We then form the direct integral Hilbert space
formula_90
The elements of this space are functions (or &quot;sections&quot;) formula_91 such that formula_92 for all formula_82. 
The direct-integral version of the spectral theorem may be expressed as follows:
The spaces formula_94 can be thought of as something like &quot;eigenspaces&quot; for formula_45. Note, however, that unless the one-element set formula_82 has positive measure, the space formula_94 is not actually a subspace of the direct integral. Thus, the formula_94&#x27;s should be thought of as &quot;generalized eigenspace&quot;—that is, the elements of formula_94 are &quot;eigenvectors&quot; that do not actually belong to the Hilbert space.

Although both the multiplication-operator and direct integral formulations of the spectral theorem express a self-adjoint operator as unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator, the direct integral approach is more canonical. First, the set over which the direct integral takes place (the spectrum of the operator) is canonical. Second, the function we are multiplying by is canonical in the direct-integral approach: Simply the function formula_100.

===Cyclic vectors and simple spectrum===
A vector formula_101 is called a cyclic vector for formula_45 if the vectors formula_103 span a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. Suppose formula_45 is a bounded self-adjoint operator for which a cyclic vector exists. In that case, there is no distinction between the direct-integral and multiplication-operator formulations of the spectral theorem. Indeed, in that case, there is a measure formula_71 on the spectrum formula_59 of formula_45 such that formula_45 is unitarily equivalent to the &quot;multiplication by formula_82&quot; operator on formula_110. This result represents formula_45 simultaneously as a multiplication operator &quot;and&quot; as a direct integral, since formula_110 is just a direct integral in which each Hilbert space formula_94 is just formula_114.

Not every bounded self-adjoint operator admits a cyclic vector; indeed, by the uniqueness in the direct integral decomposition, this can occur only when all the formula_94&#x27;s have dimension one. When this happens, we say that formula_45 has &quot;simple spectrum&quot; in the sense of spectral multiplicity theory. That is, a bounded self-adjoint operator that admits a cyclic vector should be thought of as the infinite-dimensional generalization of a self-adjoint matrix with distinct eigenvalues (i.e., each eigenvalue has multiplicity one).

Although not every formula_45 admits a cyclic vector, it is easy to see that we can decompose the Hilbert space as a direct sum of invariant subspaces on which formula_45 has a cyclic vector. This observation is the key to the proofs of the multiplication-operator and direct-integral forms of the spectral theorem.

===Functional calculus===
One important application of the spectral theorem (in whatever form) is the idea of defining a functional calculus. That is, given a function formula_56 defined on the spectrum of formula_45, we wish to define an operator formula_121. If formula_56 is simply a positive power, formula_123, then formula_121 is just the formula_125-th power of formula_45, formula_127. The interesting cases are where formula_56 is a nonpolynomial function such as a square root or an exponential. Either of the versions of the spectral theorem provides such a functional calculus. In the direct-integral version, for example, formula_121 acts as the &quot;multiplication by formula_56&quot; operator in the direct integral:
formula_131
That is to say, each space formula_94 in the direct integral is a (generalized) eigenspace for formula_121 with eigenvalue formula_134.

== Unbounded self-adjoint operators ==
Many important linear operators which occur in analysis, such as differential operators, are unbounded. There is also a spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators that applies in these cases. To give an example, every constant-coefficient differential operator is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator. Indeed, the unitary operator that implements this equivalence is the Fourier transform; the multiplication operator is a type of Fourier multiplier.

In general, spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators may take several equivalent forms. Notably, all of the formulations given in the previous section for bounded self-adjoint operators—the projection-valued measure version, the multiplication-operator version, and the direct-integral version—continue to hold for unbounded self-adjoint operators, with small technical modifications to deal with domain issues. Specifically, the only reason the multiplication operator formula_45 on formula_36 is bounded, is due to the choice of domain formula_39. The same operator on, e.g., formula_138 would be unbounded. 

The notion of &quot;generalized eigenvectors&quot; naturally extends to unbounded self-adjoint operators, as they are characterized as non-normalizable eigenvectors. Contrary to the case of almost eigenvectors, however, the eigenvalues can be real or complex and, even if they are real, do not necessarily belong to the spectrum. Though, for self-adjoint operators there always exist a real subset of &quot;generalized eigenvalues&quot; such that the corresponding set of eigenvectors is complete.

<text>Tremelo () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant, in Flanders. The municipality comprises the towns of Baal and Tremelo proper. On January 1, 2006, Tremelo had a total population of 13,725. The total area is 21.57 km² (5330 acres) which gives a population density of 636 inhabitants per km² (1647 per sq. mi.).

Located in the &quot;arrondissement&quot; or administrative district of Leuven, the official language is Dutch. Tremelo is most famous for having been the hometown of Father Damien, SS.CC. whom Pope Benedict XVI canonized on October 11, 2009, as Saint Damien of Molokai. Father Damien is locally known as Pater Damiaan, and was a legendary martyr of charity who had tended to the lepers in the Hawaiian Islands.

<text>The Senate of Canada () is the upper house of the Parliament of Canada. Together with the Crown and the House of Commons, they compose the bicameral legislature of Canada.

The Senate is modelled after the British House of Lords, with its members appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister. The appointment is made primarily by four divisions, each having twenty-four senators: the Maritime division, the Quebec division, the Ontario division, and the Western division. Newfoundland and Labrador is not part of any division, and has six senators. Each of the three territories has one senator, bringing the total to 105 senators. Senate appointments were originally for life; since 1965, they have been subject to a mandatory retirement age of 75.

Although the Senate is the upper house of parliament and the House of Commons is the lower house, this does not imply the former is more powerful than the latter. It merely entails that its members and officers outrank the members and officers of the Commons in the order of precedence for the purposes of protocol. As a matter of practice and custom, the opposite is true, with the House of Commons being the dominant chamber. The prime minister and Cabinet are responsible solely to the House of Commons and remain in office only so long as they retain the confidence of that chamber. Parliament is composed of the two houses together with the &quot;Crown-in-Parliament&quot; (i.e. the monarch, represented by the governor general as viceroy).

The approval of both houses is necessary for legislation to become law, and thus the Senate can reject bills passed by the House of Commons. In practice, this power has rarely been invoked throughout Canadian history. Although legislation can normally be introduced in either chamber, the majority of government bills originate in the House of Commons, with the Senate acting as the chamber of &quot;sober second thought&quot; (as it was called by Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada&#x27;s first prime minister).

Notable examples of the Senate failing to approve a bill passed by the Commons include its rejection of the &quot;Naval Aid Bill&quot;, its refusal to allow a vote on legislation enabling the 1988 Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, thus precipitating the 1988 Canadian federal election, and the 1991 defeat on a tie vote of a bill that would have criminalized abortion, the first time since 1941 that the Senate defeated a bill that had been approved by the Commons.

==History==
The Senate came into existence in 1867, when the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the &quot;British North America Act 1867&quot; (now entitled the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;), uniting the Province of Canada (as two separate provinces, Quebec and Ontario), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a single federal Dominion. The Canadian parliament was based on the Westminster system (that is, the model of the Parliament of the United Kingdom). Canada&#x27;s first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, described the Senate as a body of &quot;sober second thought&quot; that would curb the &quot;democratic excesses&quot; of the elected House of Commons and provide regional representation. He believed that if the House of Commons properly represented the population, the upper chamber should represent the regions. It was not meant to be more than a revising body or a brake on the House of Commons. Therefore, it was deliberately made an appointed house, since an elected Senate might prove too popular and too powerful and be able to block the will of the House of Commons.

In 2008 the Canadian Heraldic Authority granted the Senate, as an institution, a coat of arms composed of a depiction of the chamber&#x27;s mace (representing the monarch&#x27;s authority in the upper chamber) behind the escutcheon of the Arms of Canada.

===Senate reform===
Discussion of Senate reform dates back to at least 1874, but to date there has been little meaningful change.

In 1927, The Famous Five Canadian women asked the Supreme Court to determine whether women were eligible to become senators. In the Persons Case, the court unanimously held that women could not become senators since they were not &quot;qualified persons&quot;. On appeal, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled that women were persons, and four months later, Cairine Wilson was appointed to the senate.

In the 1960s, discussion of reform appeared along with the Quiet Revolution and the rise of Western alienation. The first change to the Senate was in 1965, when a mandatory retirement age of 75 years was set. Appointments made before then were for life.

In the 1970s, the emphasis was on increased provincial involvement in the senators&#x27; appointments. Since the 1970s, there have been several proposals for constitutional Senate reform, all of which have failed, including the 1987 Meech Lake Accord, and the 1992 Charlottetown Accord.

Starting in the 1980s, proposals were put forward to elect senators. After Parliament enacted the National Energy Program Western Canadians called for a Triple-E (elected, equal, and effective) senate. In 1982 the Senate was given a qualified veto over certain constitutional amendments. In 1987 Alberta legislated for the Alberta Senate nominee elections. Results of the 1989 Alberta Senate nominee election were non-binding.

Following the Canadian Senate expenses scandal Prime Minister Stephen Harper declared a moratorium on further appointments. Harper had advocated for an elected Senate for decades, but his proposals were blocked by a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that requires a constitutional amendment approved by a minimum of seven provinces, whose populations together accounted for at least half of the national population.

In 2014, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau expelled all senators from the Liberal caucus and, as prime minister in 2016, created the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointment, both of which were attempts to make the Senate less partisan without requiring constitutional change. Members of the board include members from each jurisdiction where there is a vacancy. The board provides a short list of recommended candidates to the prime minister, who is not bound to accept them. Some provinces refused to participate, stating that it would make the situation worse by lending the Senate some legitimacy. From the beginning of the new appointments process in 2016 until April 2023, 66 new senators, all selected under this procedure, were appointed to fill vacancies. All Canadians may now apply directly for a Senate appointment at any time, or nominate someone they believe meets the merit criteria.

==Chamber and offices==

The original Senate chamber was lost to the fire that consumed the Parliament Buildings in 1916. The Senate then sat in the mineral room of what is today the Canadian Museum of Nature until 1922, when it relocated to Parliament Hill. With the Centre Block undergoing renovations, temporary chambers have been constructed in the Senate of Canada Building, where the Senate began meeting in 2019.

There are chairs and desks on both sides of the chamber, divided by a centre aisle. A public gallery is above the chamber. The dais of the speaker is at one end of the chamber, and includes the new royal thrones, made in part from English walnut from Windsor Great Park. Outside of Parliament Hill, most senators have offices in the Victoria Building across Wellington Street.

==Composition==
===Qualifications===
Senators are appointed by the governor general via the recommendation of the prime minister. Traditionally, members of the prime minister&#x27;s party were chosen. The constitution requires that a person be a subject of the King, between 30 and 75 years of age and a resident of the province or territory for which they are appointed, to become a senator. Senators must also own property worth at least $4,000 above their debts and liabilities, a rule introduced to ensure senators were not beholden to economic vagaries and turmoil. There is a mandatory retirement age of 75. A sitting senator is disqualified from holding office if they:

*fail to attend two consecutive sessions of the Senate;
*become a subject or citizen of a foreign power;
*file for bankruptcy;
*are convicted of treason or an indictable offence; or
*cease to be qualified in respect of property or of residence (except where required to stay in Ottawa because they hold a government office).

===Representation===
Each province and territory is entitled to its number of Senate seats specified in section 22. That section divides most of the provinces of Canada geographically among four regions, with one province and all three territories remaining outside any division. The divisions have equal representation of 24 senators each: Western Canada, Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes. The Western division comprises British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, each having 6 seats. The Maritimes division comprises New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, who each have 10 seats, and Prince Edward Island, which has 4 seats. Newfoundland and Labrador is represented by six senators. The Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut have one senator each.

Quebec senators are the only ones to be assigned to specific districts within their province. This rule was adopted to ensure that both French- and English-speakers from Quebec were represented appropriately in the Senate.

Like most other upper houses worldwide, the Canadian formula does not use representation by population as a primary criterion for member selection, since this is already done for the House of Commons. Rather, the intent when the formula was struck was to achieve a balance of regional interests and to provide a house of &quot;sober second thought&quot; to check the power of the lower house when necessary. Therefore, the most populous province (Ontario) and two western provinces that were low-population at their accession to the federation and that are within a region are under-represented, while the Maritimes are over-represented. For example, British Columbia, with a population of about five million, sends six senators to Ottawa, whereas Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, both with populations under one million, are entitled to 10 senators each. Only Quebec has a share of senators approximate to its share of the total population.

Senators must possess land worth at least $4,000 and have residency in the province or territory for which they are appointed. In the past, the residency requirement has often been interpreted liberally, with virtually any holding that met the property qualification, including primary residences, second residences, summer homes, investment properties, and undeveloped lots, having been deemed to meet the residency requirement; as long as the senator listed a qualifying property as a residence, no further efforts have typically been undertaken to verify whether they actually resided there in any meaningful way.

Residency has come under increased scrutiny, particularly as several senators have faced allegations of irregularities in their housing expense claims. In 2013, the Senate&#x27;s internal economy committee required all senators to provide documents proving their residency in the provinces.

There exists a constitutional provision—section 26 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;—under which the sovereign may approve the appointment of four or eight extra senators, equally divided among the four regions. The approval is given by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister, and the governor general is instructed to issue the necessary letters patent. This provision has been used only once: in 1990, when Prime Minister Brian Mulroney sought to ensure the passage of a bill creating the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The appointment of eight additional senators allowed a slight majority for the Progressive Conservative Party. There was one unsuccessful attempt to use Section 26, by Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie in 1874. It was denied by Queen Victoria, on the advice of the British Cabinet. The clause does not result in a permanent increase in the number of Senate seats, however. Instead, an attrition process is applied by which senators leaving office through normal means are not replaced until after their province has returned to its normal number of seats.

Since 1989, the voters of Alberta have elected &quot;senators-in-waiting&quot;, or nominees for the province&#x27;s Senate seats. These elections, however, are not held pursuant to any federal constitutional or legal provision; thus, the prime minister is not required to recommend the nominees for appointment. Five senators-in-waiting have been appointed to the Senate: the first was Stan Waters, who was appointed in 1990 on the recommendation of Brian Mulroney; the second was Bert Brown, elected a senator-in-waiting in 1998 and 2004, and appointed to the Senate in 2007 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Stephen Harper; the third was Betty Unger, elected in 2004 and appointed in 2012; the fourth and fifth, Doug Black and Scott Tannas, were both elected in 2012 and appointed in 2013. None of the senators-in-waiting elected in 2021 have been appointed to the senate.

The base annual salary of a senator was $150,600 in 2019, although members may receive additional salaries in right of other offices they hold (for instance, the title of Speaker). Most senators rank immediately above Members of Parliament in the order of precedence, although the speaker is ranked just above the speaker of the House of Commons and both are a few ranks higher than the remaining senators.

===Current composition===
====Parliamentary groups====
While for much of the Senate&#x27;s history, most senators were affiliated with the same federal political parties that seek seats in elections to the House of Commons, this has changed in the 21st century and the large majority of current senators have no formal partisan affiliations. From 1867 to 2015, prime ministers normally chose members of their own parties to be senators, though they sometimes nominated non-affiliated senators or members of opposing parties. Since November 4, 2015, all newly appointed Senators have not been affiliated with a political party and there has been no government caucus in the Senate. On December 6, 2016, for the first time in Canadian history the number of senators without a partisan affiliation exceeded that of the largest parliamentary group of senators with a partisan affiliation, and on October 17, 2017, the largest parliamentary group became one composed of senators unaffiliated with a political party. By the end of the 43rd Parliament, only 20 per cent of senators were affiliated with a political party, all members of the Conservative caucus.

Senators are organized into one of four recognized parliamentary groups (or caucuses), or are described as non-affiliated if they are members of none. Three of the parliamentary groups have weak to nonexistent patterns of party discipline and in lieu of a whip designate an individual to serve as a liaison; they have accordingly been compared to technical groups or crossbenchers in other jurisdictions. By contrast, the Conservative group remains affiliated with the federal party with its members attending caucus meetings with its members of the House of Commons; they follow the party whip as a condition of continued affiliation.

====Gender====
A majority of sitting senators are women. , there are 51 women in the Senate out of 94 sitting members (54.4%).

The Senate has generally had a higher level of female representation than the House of Commons throughout history. The number of female senators equalled males for the first time ever on November 11, 2020, and surpassed males for the first time on October 2, 2022.

;Notes
===Vacancies===
There is some debate as to whether there is any requirement for the prime minister to advise the governor general to appoint new senators to fill vacancies as they arise. In 2014, Leader of the Opposition Tom Mulcair argued that there is no constitutional requirement to fill vacancies. Constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has commented that the courts &quot;might be tempted to grant a remedy&quot; if the refusal to recommend appointments caused the Senate to be diminished to such a degree that it could not do its work or serve its constitutional function.

Vancouver lawyer Aniz Alani filed an application for judicial review of Prime Minister Stephen Harper&#x27;s apparent refusal to advise the appointment of senators to fill existing vacancies in 2014, arguing that the failure to do so violates the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;.

On July 24, 2015, Harper announced that he would not be advising the governor general to fill the 22 vacancies in the Senate, preferring that the provinces &quot;come up with a plan of comprehensive reform or to conclude that the only way to deal with the status quo is abolition&quot;. He declined to say how long he would allow vacancies to accumulate. Under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, senators are appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister. If no such advice is forthcoming, according to constitutional scholar Adam Dodek, in &quot;extreme cases, there is no question that the Governor General would be forced to exercise such power [of appointment] without advice&quot;.

On December 5, 2015, the new Liberal government announced a new merit-based appointment process, using specific new criteria as to eligibility for the Senate. Independent applicants, not affiliated with any political party, will be approved by a new five-member advisory board (to be in place by year end), a reform that was intended to begin eliminating the partisan nature of the Senate. At the time, there were 22 vacancies in the Senate. On April 12, 2016, seven new senators were sworn in, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s hand-picked Representative of the Government in the Senate, Peter Harder.

A series of additional appointments were announced for October and November 2016 that would fill all vacancies. Once these senators were summoned, the independent non-aligned senators became more numerous than either of the party caucuses for the first time in the Senate&#x27;s history. The independent senator group also grew to include over half the total number of senators.

On December 12, 2018, the four remaining vacancies were filled in Nova Scotia, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Ontario. With these appointments, the Senate had a full complement of senators for the first time in over eight years. Since December 2018, additional senators have retired, resigned or died so the Senate currently has fewer than 105 members again, with 9 vacancies as of .

==Officers==

The speaker of the Senate is the body&#x27;s presiding officer and is appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister. The speaker is assisted by a speaker (&#x27;for the time being&#x27;), who is elected by the Senate at the beginning of each parliamentary session. If the speaker is unable to attend, the speaker presides instead. Furthermore, the &quot;Parliament of Canada Act&quot; authorizes the speaker to appoint another senator to temporarily serve. Muriel McQueen Fergusson was the Parliament of Canada&#x27;s first female speaker, holding the office from 1972 to 1974.

The speaker presides over sittings of the Senate and controls debates by calling on members to speak. Senators may raise a point of order if a rule (or standing order) has been breached, on which the speaker makes a ruling. However, the speaker&#x27;s decisions are subject to appeal to the whole Senate. When presiding, the speaker remains impartial, while maintaining membership in a political party. Unlike the speaker of the House of Commons, the speaker of the Senate does not hold a casting vote, but, instead, retains the right to vote in the same manner as any other. As of the 44th Parliament, Senator Raymonde Gagné presides as Speaker of the Senate.

The senator responsible for steering legislation through the Senate is the representative of the Government in the Senate, who is a senator selected by the prime minister and whose role is to introduce legislation on behalf of the government. The position was created in 2016 to replace the former position of leader of the Government in the Senate. The opposition equivalent is the leader of the Opposition in the Senate, selected by the leader of the Official Opposition. However, if the Official Opposition in the Commons is a different party than the Official Opposition in the Senate (as was the case from 2011 to 2015), then the Senate party chooses its own leader.

Officers of the Senate who are not members include the clerk, the deputy clerk, the law clerk, and several other clerks. These officers advise the speaker and members on the rules and procedure of the Senate. Another officer is the usher of the Black Rod, whose duties include the maintenance of order and security within the Senate chamber. The usher of the Black Rod bears a ceremonial black ebony staff, from which the title &quot;black rod&quot; arises. This position is roughly analogous to that of the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons, but the usher&#x27;s duties are more ceremonial.

== Committees ==
The Parliament of Canada uses committees for a variety of purposes. Committees consider bills in detail and can make amendments. Other committees scrutinize various government agencies and ministries.

The largest of the Senate committees is the Committee of the Whole, which, as the name suggests, consists of all senators. The Committee of the Whole meets in the chamber of the Senate, but proceeds under slightly modified rules of debate. (For example, there is no limit on the number of speeches a senator may make on a particular motion.) The presiding officer is known as the chairman. The Senate may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for a number of purposes, including to consider legislation or to hear testimony from individuals. Nominees to be officers of Parliament often appear before Committee of the Whole to answer questions with respect to their qualifications prior to their appointment.

The Senate also has several standing committees, each of which has responsibility for a particular area of government (for example, finance or transport). These committees consider legislation and conduct special studies on issues referred to them by the Senate and may hold hearings, collect evidence, and report their findings to the Senate. Standing committees consist of between nine and fifteen members each and elect their own chairmen.

Special committees are appointed by the Senate on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis to consider a particular issue. The number of members for a special committee varies, but, the partisan composition would roughly reflect the strength of the parties in the whole Senate. These committees have been struck to study bills (e.g., the Special Senate Committee on Bill C-36 (the &quot;Anti-terrorism Act&quot;), 2001) or particular issues of concern (e.g., the Special Senate Committee on Illegal Drugs).

Other committees include joint committees, which include both members of the House of Commons and senators. There are currently two joint committees: the Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations, which considers delegated legislation, and the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament, which advises the two speakers on the management of the library. Parliament may also establish special joint committees on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis to consider issues of particular interest or importance.

==Legislative functions==

Although legislation may be introduced in either chamber, most bills originate in the House of Commons. Because the Senate&#x27;s schedule for debate is more flexible than that of the House of Commons, the government will sometimes introduce particularly complex legislation in the Senate first.

In conformity with the British model, the Senate is not permitted to originate bills imposing taxes or appropriating public funds. Unlike in Britain but similar to the United States, this restriction on the power of the Senate is not merely a matter of convention but is explicitly stated in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. In addition, the House of Commons may, in effect, override the Senate&#x27;s refusal to approve an amendment to the Canadian constitution; however, they must wait at least 180 days before exercising this override. Other than these two exceptions, the power of the two Houses of Parliament is theoretically equal; the approval of each is necessary for a bill&#x27;s passage. In practice, however, the House of Commons is the dominant chamber of parliament, with the Senate very rarely exercising its powers in a manner that opposes the will of the democratically elected chamber. Although the Senate has not vetoed a bill from the House of Commons since 1939, minor changes proposed by the Senate to a bill are usually accepted by the Commons.

The Senate tends to be less partisan and confrontational than the Commons and is more likely to come to a consensus on issues. It also often has more opportunity to study proposed bills in detail either as a whole or in committees. This careful review process is why the Senate is still today called the chamber of &quot;sober second thought&quot;, though the term has a slightly different meaning from what it did when used by John A. Macdonald. The format of the Senate allows it to make many small improvements to legislation before its final reading.

The Senate, at times, is more active at reviewing, amending, and even rejecting legislation. In the first 60 years following Confederation, approximately 180 bills were passed by the House of Commons and sent to the Senate that subsequently did not receive Royal Assent, either because they were rejected by the Senate or were passed by the Senate with amendments that were not accepted by the Commons. In contrast, fewer than one-quarter of that number of bills were lost for similar reasons in the sixty-year period from 1928 to 1987. The late 1980s and early 1990s was a period of contention. During this period, the Senate opposed legislation on issues such as the 1988 free trade bill with the US (forcing the Canadian federal election of 1988) and the Goods and Services Tax. In the 1990s, the Senate rejected four pieces of legislation: a bill passed by the Commons restricting abortion (C-43), a proposal to streamline federal agencies (C-93), a bill to redevelop the Lester B. Pearson Airport (C-28), and a bill on profiting from authorship as it relates to crime (C-220). From 2000 to 2013, the Senate rejected 75 bills in total.

In December 2010, the Senate rejected Bill C-311, involving greenhouse gas regulation that would have committed Canada to a 25 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020 and an 80 per cent reduction by 2050. The bill was passed by all the parties except the Conservatives in the House of Commons and was rejected by the majority Conservatives in the Senate on a vote of 43 to 32.

=== Divorce and other private bills ===
Historically, before the passage of the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; in 1968, there was no divorce legislation in either Quebec or Newfoundland. The only way for couples to get divorced in these provinces was to apply to Parliament for a private bill of divorce. These bills were primarily handled by the Senate, where a special committee would undertake an investigation of a request for a divorce. If the committee found that the request had merit, the marriage would be dissolved by an Act of Parliament. A similar situation existed in Ontario before 1930. This function has not been exercised since 1968 as the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; provided a uniform statutory basis across Canada accessed through the court system.

However, though increasingly rare, private bills usually commence in the Senate and only upon petition by a private person (natural or legal). In addition to the general stages public bills must go through, private bills also require the Senate to perform some judicial functions to ensure the petitioner&#x27;s request does not impair rights of other persons.

=== Investigative functions ===
The Senate also performs investigative functions. In the 1960s, the Senate authored the first Canadian reports on media concentration with the Special Senate Subcommittee on Mass Media, or the Davey Commission, since &quot;appointed senators would be better insulated from editorial pressure brought by publishers&quot;; this triggered the formation of press councils. More recent investigations include the Kirby Commissions on health care (as opposed to the Romanow Commission) and mental health care by Senator Michael Kirby and the &quot;Final Report on the Canadian News Media&quot; in 2006.

== Relationship with the Government of Canada ==
Unlike the House of Commons, the Senate has no effect in the decision to end the term of the prime minister or of the government. Only the House of Commons may force prime ministers to tender their resignation or to recommend the dissolution of Parliament and issue election writs, by passing a motion of no-confidence or by withdrawing supply. Thus, the Senate&#x27;s oversight of the government is limited.

The Senate does however, approve the appointment of certain officials and approves the removal of certain officials, in some cases only for cause, and sometimes in conjunction with the House of Commons, usually as a recommendation from the Governor in Council. Officers in this category include the auditor general of Canada, and the Senate must join in the resolution to remove the chief electoral officer of Canada.

Most Cabinet ministers are from the House of Commons. In particular, every prime minister has been a member of the House of Commons since 1896, with the exception of John Turner. Typically, the Cabinet includes only one senator: the leader of the Government in the Senate. Occasionally, when the governing party does not include any members from a particular region, senators are appointed to ministerial positions in order to maintain regional balance in the Cabinet. The most recent example of this was on February 6, 2006, when Stephen Harper advised that Michael Fortier be appointed to be both a senator representing the Montreal region, where the minority government had no elected representation, and the Cabinet position of Minister of Public Works and Government Services. Fortier resigned his Senate seat to run (unsuccessfully) for a House of Commons seat in the 2008 general election.

==Broadcasting==
Unlike the House of Commons, proceedings of the Senate were historically not carried by CPAC, as the upper house long declined to allow its sessions to be televised. On April 25, 2006, Senator Hugh Segal moved that the proceedings of the Senate be televised; the motion was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rules, Procedures and the Rights of Parliament for consideration; although the motion was approved in principle, broadcast of Senate proceedings was not actually launched at that time apart from selected committee meetings.

Full broadcast of Senate proceedings began on March 18, 2019, concurrent with the Senate&#x27;s temporary relocation to the Senate of Canada Building.

<doc id="123500" wikidata="Q2865565" url="?curid=123500" title="Section 33 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">
<text>Section 33 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; is part of the Constitution of Canada. It is commonly known as the notwithstanding clause (, , or, as prescribed by the Quebec Board of the French Language, ). Sometimes referred to as the override power, it allows Parliament or provincial legislatures to temporarily override sections 2 and 7–15 of the &quot;Charter.&quot;

==Text==

The section states:
==Function==

The Parliament of Canada, a provincial legislature or a territorial legislature may declare that one of its laws or part of a law applies temporarily (&quot;notwithstanding&quot;) countermanding sections of the &quot;Charter&quot;, thereby nullifying any judicial review by overriding the &quot;Charter&quot; protections for a limited period of time. This is done by including a section in the law clearly specifying which rights have been overridden. A simple majority vote in any of Canada&#x27;s 14 jurisdictions may suspend the core rights of the &quot;Charter&quot;. However, the rights to be overridden must be either a &quot;fundamental right&quot; guaranteed by Section 2 (such as freedom of expression, religion, and association), a &quot;legal right&quot; guaranteed by Sections 7–14 (such as rights to liberty and freedom from search and seizures and cruel and unusual punishment) or a Section 15 &quot;equality right&quot;. Other rights such as section 6 mobility rights, democratic rights, and language rights are inviolable.

Such a declaration ends after five years or a lesser time specified in the clause, although the legislature may re-enact the clause any number of times. The rationale behind having a five-year expiry date is that it is also the maximum amount of time the Parliament or legislature may sit before an election must be called. Therefore, if the people so desire, they have the right to elect new representatives who could choose to repeal the law or let the declaration expire. (The provisions of the &quot;Charter&quot; that deal with elections and democratic representation (§§3–5) are not among those that can be overridden with the notwithstanding clause (§§2,7–15).)

The notwithstanding clause reflects the hybrid character of Canadian political institutions. In effect, it protects the British tradition of parliamentary supremacy under the American-style system of written constitutional rights and strong courts introduced in 1982. Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien also described it as a tool that could guard against a Supreme Court ruling legalizing hate speech and child pornography as freedom of expression.

==History==

The idea for the clause was proposed by Peter Lougheed as suggested by Merv Leitch. The clause was a compromise reached during the debate over the new constitution in the early 1980s. Among the provinces&#x27; major complaints about the &quot;Charter&quot; was that it shifted power from elected officers to the judiciary, giving the courts the final word. Section 33, along with the limitations clause, in section 1, was intended to give provincial legislators more leverage to pass law. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau at first strongly objected to the clause, but eventually consented to its inclusion under pressure from the provincial premiers.
The clause was included as part of what is known as &quot;The Kitchen Accord&quot;. At the end of a conference on the constitution that was poised to end in deadlock, Jean Chrétien, the federal justice minister, and Roy McMurtry and Roy Romanow, both provincial ministers, met in a kitchen in the Government Conference Centre in Ottawa and sowed the seeds for a deal. This compromise caused two major changes to the constitution package: the first was that the &quot;Charter&quot; would include the &quot;notwithstanding clause&quot;, and the second was an agreed-upon amending formula. They then worked through the night with consultations from different premiers, and agreement from almost everybody. However, they excluded from the negotiations René Lévesque, the premier of Quebec. He refused to agree to the deal, and the Quebec government declined to endorse the constitutional amendment. Chrétien would later say, of the notwithstanding clause, &quot;Canada probably wouldn&#x27;t have had any &quot;Charter&quot; without it.&quot;

In exchange for agreeing to the Notwithstanding Clause, Trudeau declined to remove the federal powers of disallowance and reservation from the draft Constitution.

When it was introduced, Alan Borovoy, the general counsel to the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, addressed concerns that the Notwithstanding clause was susceptible to abuse from a government by stating that &quot;Political difficulty is a reasonable safeguard for the charter.&quot;

According to Chrétien, in 1992, Trudeau blamed him for the notwithstanding clause, saying &quot;you gave them that&quot;. Chrétien replied, &quot;Sorry, Pierre. I recommended it. &quot;You&quot; gave it.&quot;

During the January 9, 2006, party leaders&#x27; debate for the 2006 federal election, Prime Minister Paul Martin unexpectedly pledged that his Liberal government, if returned, would support a constitutional amendment to prevent the federal government from invoking section 33, and challenged Conservative leader Stephen Harper to agree. This sparked a debate about how the notwithstanding clause could be amended. Some argued that the amending formula required the federal government to gain the approval of at least seven provinces with at least half the national population (the standard procedure). Others argued that, because the proposal would limit only the federal Parliament&#x27;s powers, Parliament could make the change alone.

==Comparison with other human rights instruments==
Constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has remarked that the notwithstanding clause &quot;seems to be a uniquely Canadian invention&quot;. The United States Constitution gives no such powers to the states (see: nullification), but Article III, sect. 2 does authorize the Congress to remove jurisdiction from the federal courts. Not since World War II has Congress mustered the requisite majority.

However, the concept of the notwithstanding clause was not created with the Charter. The presence of the clause makes the Charter similar to the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot; (1960), which, under section 2, states that &quot;an Act of the Parliament&quot; may declare that a law &quot;shall operate notwithstanding the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;&quot;. A primary difference is that the Bill of Rights&#x27; notwithstanding clause could be used to invalidate &quot;any&quot; right, not just specified clauses as with the Charter. The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (1979), the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms (1977), and the Alberta Bill of Rights (1972) also contain devices like the notwithstanding clause.

Outside Canada, Israel added a device similar to the notwithstanding clause to one of its Basic Laws in 1992. However, this power could be used only in respect of the freedom of occupation. The 2023 Israeli judicial reform envisaged extending this power to all matters, including the Basic Laws which do not deal with rights and freedoms.

In Victoria, Australia, section 31 of the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities fulfils a similar purpose.

The uncodified constitution of the United Kingdom has an implicit equivalent of a notwithstanding clause: following the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, the courts have no power to declare primary legislation invalid on constitutional grounds, including on grounds of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 requires legislation to be interpreted in a way compatible with the Convention &quot;if possible&quot;, but they must nonetheless enforce any primary legislation that they cannot so interpret. This does not apply to secondary legislation or devolved legislation, which may be &quot;ultra vires&quot; if incompatible.

==Uses==

Four provinces and one territory have passed laws invoking the notwithstanding clause. The clause has been invoked most frequently by Quebec, including the blanket application of the clause to every law from 1982–1985, a French-only sign law in 1988, a law prohibiting state-affiliated employees from wearing religious symbols in 2019, and a law strengthening the use of French in 2022. Saskatchewan passed a back-to-work law invoking the clause in 1986, and passed a law in 2018 (never brought into force) invoking the clause to permit the government to pay for non-Catholics to attend publicly-funded Catholic schools. Alberta passed a law invoking the clause in 2000 to define marriage as &quot;between a man and a woman&quot;; this law was effectively declared &quot;ultra vires&quot; by the Supreme Court of Canada because only the federal Parliament can define marriage. In 2021, Ontario passed a law invoking the clause to increase the time period during which third-party groups must limit their activities in the lead-up to an election. Yukon invoked the clause in 1982, but this law was never brought into force.

The federal Parliament has never introduced legislation invoking the clause. 
===Alberta===
====Compensation for forced sterilization (1998)====
In 1998, Alberta introduced, but later abandoned, a bill that would attempt to use the notwithstanding clause to limit lawsuits against the government for past forced sterilizations approved by the Alberta Eugenics Board before the Sexual Sterilization Act was repealed.

====Same-sex marriage (2000)====
In March 2000, the Legislature of Alberta passed Bill 202, which amended the province&#x27;s Marriage Act to include an opposite-sex-only definition of marriage as well as the notwithstanding clause to insulate the definition from Charter challenges. However, a legislature may use the &quot;notwithstanding clause&quot; only on legislation it would otherwise have the authority to enact, and the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in 2004 in &quot;Reference re Same-Sex Marriage&quot; that the definition of marriage is within the exclusive domain of the Parliament of Canada, thus finding Bill 202 , or beyond the constitutional powers of the Alberta Legislature.

====Other discussions of its use in Alberta====
There were also discussions to invoke the notwithstanding clause following the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s 1998 decision in &quot;Vriend v Alberta&quot;, but were resisted by Premier Ralph Klein at the time.

In 2024, Premier Danielle Smith has said she might use the notwithstanding clause to protect a gender-affirming healthcare ban.

===New Brunswick===
====Mandatory vaccinations (2019)====
On November 22, 2019, Education Minister Dominic Cardy introduced a bill in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick to end non-medical exemptions to vaccinations in school children, which includes invoking the notwithstanding clause. Cardy said this was to pre-empt any court and charter challenges to the bill by &quot;an organized, well-financed lobby out there that&#x27;s intent on derailing efforts to protect vulnerable children&quot;. The use of the notwithstanding clause was removed from the bill in June 2020, before the bill was ultimately defeated in a free vote at third reading in the legislature.

===Ontario===
====Municipal elections (2018)====
In August 2018, the government of Ontario passed the &quot;Better Local Government Act&quot;, which, among other things, ordered the Toronto City Council to change its electoral ward boundaries for the 2018 municipal election to match the boundaries used for federal and provincial electoral ridings, thus reducing the number of wards from 47 to 25. Premier of Ontario Doug Ford stated that the council had &quot;failed to act on the critical issues facing the city&quot;, and claimed cost savings of $25 million over the next four years. The bill was controversial for both its intent and its timing, as it came in the midst of a municipal election campaign. The electoral boundaries had already been realigned for the 2018 election to expand it from 44 to 47 wards, by consolidating several existing wards and adding new ones.

On September 10, 2018, the act was struck down by Superior Court Justice Edward Belobaba as unconstitutional, ruling that the larger wards infringed voters&#x27; rights to an election whose outcome provides &quot;effective representation&quot;, and that unilaterally changing electoral boundaries in the middle of a campaign infringed on candidates&#x27; freedom of expression. Shortly afterward, Ford announced his intent to table legislation authorizing an invocation of the notwithstanding clause to overturn the ruling, which, if passed, would have been the first use of the notwithstanding clause in Ontario. However, on September 19, the Court of Appeal for Ontario granted a stay of the Superior Court&#x27;s decision, allowing the province to again implement a 25-ward structure for the City of Toronto. During the oral argument for that case, the counsel for the attorney general stated that the provincial government would not proceed with the legislation to invoke the notwithstanding clause if the stay was granted. Belobaba&#x27;s ruling was ultimately overturned 3-2 by the Court of Appeal in a full hearing. The Court of Appeal ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021; in a 5-4 ruling, a majority of the Court ruled that Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Better Local Government Act&quot; violated neither freedom of expression nor the unwritten constitutional principle of democracy.

====Third-party political advertising (2021)====
In early 2021, the Ontario government passed the &quot;Protecting Ontario Elections Act, 2021&quot;, which restricted the ability of private sector organizations from running political advertisements outside of election periods. In June, The Ontario Superior Court found the law to violate freedom of expression, and struck down those sections of the law. The Ontario government then passed the &quot;Protecting Elections and Defending Democracy Act, 2021&quot; to enact the restrictions using the Notwithstanding Clause.

In March 2023, the Court of Appeal for Ontario struck down the law again, this time for violating a section of the charter not protected by the notwithstanding clause relating to voter participation.

====Education worker labour rights (2022)====
On November 3, 2022, the government of Ontario passed a bill that imposed a contract on Ontario education workers who were part of the Canadian Union of Public Employees to prevent them from striking; the bill used the Notwithstanding Clause in an attempt to prohibit the union from a constitutional challenge regarding the freedom to associate. Despite this, the education workers still went on strike after the bill was passed.

The Ontario government faced heavy backlash from the general public over the law. Other unions also threatened to walk off the job and protest the law in solidarity. As a result, the government made a deal with CUPE where the law was repealed with the provisions and penalties deemed to have never been in effect, and in exchange CUPE ended their strike and contract negotiations resumed.

===Quebec===
====Blanket application (1982–1985)====
After the Charter came into force in 1982, the Parti Québécois government in Quebec inserted wording pursuant to section 33 into every law passed by the National Assembly of Quebec, as well as retroactively amending every existing law, in an attempt to ensure that no provincial law could ever be challenged in the courts on grounds in the relevant Charter sections. This stopped in 1985, when the newly elected Quebec Liberals discontinued the practice. The Quebec Liberals did successfully invoke the notwithstanding clause to apply to a number of pieces of legislation pertaining to education and pensions between 1986 and 1992. Many of these uses of the notwithstanding clause were subsequently re-enacted.

The way the Quebec legislature deployed the clause in the late 1980s diminished public respect in the rest of the country for section 33. Due to the mass opposition that its use, or even threatened use, as in the case of Alberta (listed above), would evoke, the act of invoking the notwithstanding clause would be more politically costly even than had always been apprehended, according to some.

====Sign laws (1988)====
On December 21, 1988, after the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Ford v Quebec (AG)&quot;, the National Assembly of Quebec employed section 33 and the equivalent section 52 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms in their Bill 178. This allowed Quebec to continue to restrict the posting of certain commercial signs in languages other than French. In 1993, after the law was criticized by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, the Bourassa government had the National Assembly rewrite the law to conform to Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of the right to freedom of expression in section 2(b) Charter, and the notwithstanding clause was removed.

====Wearing of religious symbols by public servants (2019)====
On March 28, 2019, the recently elected Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) government applied the notwithstanding clause in Bill 21 (An Act respecting the Laicity of the State). The bill was passed on June 16, 2019, and prevents public workers in positions of authority from wearing religious symbols. It also prevents people from receiving public services with their faces covered.

====French language requirements for multiple sectors (2021)====

The stated goal of Bill 96 was &quot;to affirm that the only official language of Québec is French. It also affirms that French is the common language of the Québec nation.&quot; Bill 96 was adopted on May 24, 2022, with 78 MNAs in favour and 29 against (from the Liberal Party and Parti Québécois). Instead of applying the notwithstanding clause only to parts of Bill 96, the Coalition Avenir Québec government applied it to the entire Bill.

The amendment expanded the requirements of businesses to communicate in French. Previously, businesses with more than 50 employees faced additional responsibilities to have the common language be French. The amendment lowered that minimum from 50 employees to 25.

Employers may not require knowledge of a language other than French during &quot;recruitment, hiring, transfer or promotion,&quot; unless they can show the that additional language is necessary and they took &quot;all reasonable means to avoid imposing such a requirement.&quot;

The amendment also granted search and seizure laws to the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) and the Minister Responsible for the French Language. Section 111 gives the OQLF authorization to &quot;enter at any reasonable hour any place, other than a dwelling house,&quot; where a business conducts activity or holds documents. The amendment requires that anyone present with access to a device or data must provide that access to the inspectors; the inspectors also may seize devices and data for future examination and reproduction without a warrant.

The amendment also impacted health care and social services, limiting service in English to &quot;historic anglophones&quot; or &quot;&quot;, immigrants, refugees, or asylum seekers who have been in Quebec for less than 6 months, or &quot;where health, public safety or the principles of natural justice so require.&quot; The Minister of Justice and French Language, Simon Jolin-Barrette, said that access would not change for English speakers, but critics suggested that the law is unclear, especially since unlike in the &quot;Act respecting the laicity of the State&quot;, no special exemption is explicit.

===Saskatchewan===
====Back-to-work order (1986)====
In 1986, the Legislature of Saskatchewan enacted a law, the SGEU Dispute Settlement Act, in which workers were ordered back to work. The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan had previously held that a similar back-to-work law was unconstitutional because it infringed workers&#x27; freedom of association. The government appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. Since the Court of Appeal decision was still the statement of law at the time of the SGEU Dispute Settlement Act, a clause was written into the act, invoking the section 33 override. The earlier law was later found by the Supreme Court to be consistent with the Charter, meaning the use of the clause had been unnecessary.

====Catholic school funding (2018)====
In May 2018, the Saskatchewan Legislature invoked the notwithstanding clause to overrule the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench ruling in &quot;Good Spirit School Division No 204 v Christ The Teacher Roman Catholic Separate School Division No 212&quot;, 2017 SKQB 109, which stated the government could not provide funding for non-Catholic students to attend Catholic separate schools. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal overturned the decision in March 2020, and the Supreme Court of Canada declined leave to appeal. With the original decision overturned, there was no longer a need for the Notwithstanding Clause.

==== Parent consent for non-conforming gender identity in school (2023) ====
In 2023, Premier Scott Moe told reporters that the province would be willing to use the notwithstanding clause to uphold a policy requiring parents be notified of and approve any requested name and pronoun change from their child before it be recognized at school. This came after legal action was initiated by an advocacy group against the provincial government, the province&#x27;s youth advocate published a report against the policy, and a Regina court granted an injunction to stop the policy.

The bill, titled the &quot;Parents&#x27; Bill of Rights&quot;, was passed on October 20, 2023.

====Other discussions of its use in Saskatchewan====

Following a Supreme Court of Canada decision of January 30, 2015, which struck down Saskatchewan essential service legislation, Premier Brad Wall publicly considered using the notwithstanding clause to protect the province&#x27;s ability to force essential service employees back to work.

===Yukon===
====Committee appointments (1982)====
In 1982, the legislature of Yukon made use of the notwithstanding clause in the Land Planning and Development Act. This was the first use, by any Canadian legislature, of the section 33 override. However, as constitutional scholar Peter Hogg notes, the &quot;statute ... was never brought into force and so scarcely counts as an example&quot;.

<text>Troy is a city in Lincoln County, Montana, United States. The population was 797 at the 2020 census. It lies at the lowest elevation of any settlement in Montana. The town is on U.S. Route 2, near Montana Highway 56, in the Kootenai River gorge by the Kootenai National Forest.

Originally inhabited by the Kutenai, Salish, and Piegan Blackfeet tribes, the area was settled by miners in the 1880s. Troy was registered as a town in 1892 and grew quickly after the Great Northern Railway built a freight station there, leading to a boom in workers, miners, their families, and associates. The area narrowly missed wildfire damage in 1910 and expanded its services throughout the following years, though its population would drop due to a series of misfortunes in the late 1920s before rebounding in the following decades. Troy suffered from the area&#x27;s contamination from nearby vermiculite mines contaminated with particularly fragile asbestos, leading to the town&#x27;s inclusion in the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) National Priorities List status in 2002 and Public Health Emergency event in 2009. According to the EPA, most risk was reduced by 2015.

Troy is on U.S. Route 2, between Yaak and Libby. Montana Highway 56 is three miles southeast and the Troy Airport is two miles northwest. The town&#x27;s economy has historically been supported by mining and logging, while in recent times, mining has remained, with the addition of education, retail, and tourism. Local natural features such as the Kootenai Falls have attracted tourism to the area and have been featured in movies such as &quot;The River Wild&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015). There is a public school district (which created ceramic ornaments used to decorate the National Christmas Tree in 2017) and a public library, and the town is in-district for Flathead Valley Community College.

== History ==
Before the westward expansion of the United States, various indigenous peoples lived in the area, with the Kutenai and Salish as the most recent and the Piegan Blackfeet earlier. They lived in base camps and seasonal camps based on the availability of plants and fish: &quot;lower elevations in the winter and... uplands in the summer and fall,&quot; with spring camps near camas prairies, which had edible bulbs. Due to the area&#x27;s geography and settler fears of the Kutenai, the area remained unsettled until gold was discovered in the 1860s and galena and vermiculite in the 1880s. In 1886, the first miners arrived, prospecting on the Kootenai River at a tent camp first known as &quot;Lake Camp, Lake Creek Camp, and Lake City&quot;, and making land claims on Grouse Mountain. In 1892, a William O&#x27;Brien surveyed the Lake City claim, renaming it Troy.

=== Post American settlement ===
Throughout 1892, Troy was filed as a town in then-Missoula County and grew rapidly as the Great Northern Railway chose a nearby site as a &quot;division yard&quot;, or freight terminal, which was first renamed &quot;West Troy&quot; before just becoming Troy itself as the Lake City area was abandoned. The town&#x27;s first hotel, then called the Windsor Hotel, was built. One transplant described the town as such: &quot;Fifteen saloons gaily lit filled to the doors with “wild men and wild women” yelling, singing, dancing, and cursing, with glasses held high, such was Troy. Two large dance halls were in evidence, one grocery store run by John Bowen, several &#x27;beaneries&#x27; (called restaurants by some), one drug store owned by &#x27;Doc&#x27; Sailey and many shacks and tents where the &#x27;wild women&#x27; congregated. Fights and ribaldry were the order of the days and nights.&quot; Another grocery store followed in 1893, the first one-room schoolhouse was built in 1894, and more mining companies, land claims, and support services such as ferries sprung up as gold was discovered on the Yaak River in 1895.

The 1910s brought change. After the Windsor Hotel had been destroyed by fire in 1906 and rebuilt in 1907, wildfires during the summer of 1910 narrowly missed Troy by a few miles but raged throughout the area, causing lasting damage to the newly-protected Kootenai National Forest. In 1912, Troy&#x27;s first bridge across the Kootenai River was built, along with bridges in Libby and Rexford, after a county vote. Previously, crossings were made on horseback – dangerous – or via ferries, which had started operating in 1892. Phone service reached the area in 1913. U.S. Route 2 was proposed and a volunteer fire department was created. The 1918 flu closed the local mill and schools temporarily. By 1920, there was a Chinese restaurant, a church, and an electric plant in town, and World War I increased the town&#x27;s mining activity; the rapid expansion and labor conditions sometimes led to strikes and labor conflicts.

The town&#x27;s population reached 1000 residents in 1924, and the same year, the town&#x27;s Lincoln Theatre opened. The population peaked around 1926, but in March of that year, the Great Northern Railway moved its freight terminal elsewhere, leaving &quot;only three supervisors and [a] small force of Japanese [workers].&quot; Fires destroyed a concentrator in 1927 and a sawmill in 1928, with neither rebuilt, and the region&#x27;s mines decreased in activity.

The population dropped to as low as 428 during 1930 in the Great Depression. Still, the Lincoln Theatre began playing talking movies and the Windsor Hotel was renamed to the Great Northern Hotel, which stood until it burned down (for the second time) in 1941. A coffee house and cable shop operate on its former location. The Lincoln Theatre was remodeled in 1994.

In 2006, the Troy Jail and the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Bridge were added to the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Vermiculite cleanup ===

After citizens, media, and local government raised concerns, the United States Environmental Protection Agency began in 1999 to investigate the contamination of the area surrounding Libby and Troy from vermiculite mines in Libby, which were themselves contaminated with a toxic and easily crumbled form of tremolite-actinolite series asbestos, sometimes named Libby Amphibole asbestos (LA). Removal actions began in 2000, and in 2002 the site was moved to the EPA&#x27;s Superfund National Priorities List. In 2009, the EPA declared a Public Health Emergency (the first in the EPA&#x27;s history) &quot;to provide federal health care assistance for victims of asbestos-related disease.&quot;

In 2015, an EPA review of toxicity and risks found that the cleanups had managed asbestos exposure risk effectively. By the end of 2018, the EPA had removed &quot;more than one million cubic yards of contaminated soil,&quot; and area cleanup was completed that year, except for the location of the former mine, which is the disposal site of the contaminated soil. Contaminated construction materials were disposed of &quot;in a specially designed landfill cell.&quot; The remaining contamination is limited to the forests and property in or near the former mine, with cleanup plans pending and with controls for higher exposures during wildfire fighting.

The EPA transferred control of the site to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality in 2020.

==Geography==

Troy lies in a valley along the Kootenai River between the Purcell Mountains to the northeast and the Cabinet Mountains to the southwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Troy has an elevation of approximately above sea level and is the lowest town in elevation in Montana. Troy is from the border of Montana and Idaho. Troy&#x27;s next closest city is Libby, which is away.

The Troy Mine, which produced silver and copper, was scheduled for closure in February 2015.

An early worker described the original flora of the city site as &quot;a carpet of velvety green grass, thickly studded with wild flowers of most every hue and color.&quot; There are groves of ancient western red cedars nearby, some up to in diameter, which are a home for species of wildlife including pikas and flying squirrels.

Troy is located in the Kootenai River Gorge, which is geologically composed of &quot;sandstone and thin layers of shale, with folds from compression that dates back 50 to 100 million years ago. The rock was deposited 1.5 million years ago, when much of Montana was covered by water. Ancient ripple marks and large stromatolites (the remains of algae mats) are visible in the canyon.&quot;

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Troy has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dsb&quot; on climate maps. Troy&#x27;s annual mean temperature is and its annual mean precipitation is . Flooding is an issue for the area.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 938 people, 454 households, and 240 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 490 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 94.3% White, 0.2% African American, 1.7% Native American, 0.5% Asian, 0.1% from other races, and 3.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.9% of the population.

There were 454 households, of which 25.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.2% were married couples living together, 9.5% had a female householder with no husband present, 6.2% had a male householder with no wife present, and 47.1% were non-families. 37.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.07 and the average family size was 2.71.

The median age in the city was 46.8 years. 20% of residents were under the age of 18; 5.5% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 21.9% were from 25 to 44; 35.7% were from 45 to 64; and 16.8% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 49.3% male and 50.7% female.

== Economy and recreation ==
The area is covered by the Lincoln County Port Authority. Troy&#x27;s modern economy is largely based on &quot;mining, education, retail, and tourism,&quot; while its historical economy was based on mining and logging. A train freight yard, a sawmill, and an ore processing facility were the main employers until they were lost to relocation and fires in the late 1920s, just before the Great Depression. Gold, galena, and vermiculite were mined beginning in the late 1800s. During World War I, the town&#x27;s mines produced lead, zinc, and silver, with much zinc exported to Belgium. In 2020, the Montana Community Solar Project assessed Troy public schools for their solar power potential and found the high school building had good potential. Since 2008, the school and city have been partially fueled by wood pellet waste from nearby lumber mills, replacing fuel oil use.

Notable nearby attractions include the Kootenai Falls and the Kootenai Falls Swinging Bridge, which was rebuilt in 2019 due to its increasing popularity. The Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Bridge in Troy is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Local activities include hiking, snowmobiling, camping, boating, rafting, bird watching, fishing, and geocaching. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation was founded by four Troy hunters to help conserve elk and other wildlife species. There is a disc golf course at the Troy Museum and Visitors&#x27; Center, which also hosts art events with the local glass art guild. Nearby parks host various cultural and music festivals.

==Education==
Troy has a public library, a branch of the Lincoln County Public Libraries. The town&#x27;s branch opened in 1922 after the Lincoln County&#x27;s Free County Library expanded.

Troy&#x27;s first school, a one-room schoolhouse, was built in 1894. In 1937, the Bull Lake School in Bull Lake Valley and Fall Creek School by Schoolhouse Lake were consolidated into the Troy public school district. The public school district includes:

* W.F. Morrison Elementary School (Kindergarten–Sixth grade)
* Troy Junior-Senior High School (Seventh grade–Twelfth grade)
The high school provides adult education classes in the fall and spring. The school has a &quot;school-to-work&quot; program in which students can participate in summer projects based in the local economy and in which an AmeriCorps volunteer serves as a mentor for student college applications/visits and community involvement in student activities. After the Troy Art Club&#x27;s ceramic ornaments were some of the ones chosen for the US National Christmas Tree in 2017, the club created a business, Wild In Montana, &quot;assisting [the] economically depressed community and offering a class with real-world skills.&quot;

Other nearby schools with Troy addresses include:

* McCormick Elementary School (K-8)
* Yaak Elementary School (K-8)

The area qualifies for in-district tuition at Flathead Valley Community College (FVCC) in Kalispell, Montana, as well as FVCC&#x27;s Lincoln County Campus in Libby, which has the &quot;Glacier Bank Adult Basic Education Learning Center where students can take free classes in preparation for their GED exams.&quot;

== Transportation ==
Troy is on U.S. Route 2, between Yaak to the north and Libby to the southeast. Montana Highway 56 is three miles to the southeast of Troy.

The Troy Airport is one mile northwest of the majority of the town of Troy.

The closest Amtrak stop is Libby station, away. The &quot;Empire Builder&quot; served Troy until February 15, 1973.

<text>Ennis is a town in Madison County, Montana, United States, in the southwestern part of the state. The population was 917 at the 2020 census, up from 838 in 2010.

U.S. Route 287 runs through town, following the Madison River as it descends from the town of West Yellowstone.

==History==
In 1863, gold was discovered in Alder Gulch. This brought on &quot;the rush&quot;. Two months later, William Ennis homesteaded the site along the Madison River that was soon to become the town of Ennis, his namesake.

In 1886, a mystery creature was noted for making livestock kills in the Madison Valley. A local rancher, Israel Ammon Hutchins, finally shot and killed the beast, after accidentally shooting one of his cattle, which was on the other side of some brush. A local taxidermist stuffed the canine. Jack Kirby (Hutchins&#x27; grandson) tracked the mount to a museum in Pocatello, Idaho, &quot;circa&quot; 2007.

Avid Aircraft, a manufacturer of homebuilt aircraft, was located in Ennis. The company ceased operations in 2003.

The 2003 Ennis shooting took place on June 14 of that year, when 44-year-old George Harold Davis opened fire outside the Silver Dollar Saloon bar on Main Street. He killed one man and injured six others. He then fled to Missoula County, where he was finally stopped and arrested by police. He was sentenced to eleven life terms for the crime.

The Thexton Ranch is located approximately south of Ennis, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
The town is flanked by Tobacco Root Mountains to the northwest, the Gravelly Range to the southwest and the Madison Range to the east. Approximately north of town, the Madison Dam creates Ennis Lake at the head of Bear Trap Canyon.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.14%, are water. The Madison River, one of the three headwater tributaries of the Missouri River, runs along the eastern border of the town.

<text>The Three Principles of the People (), also known as the Three People&#x27;s Principles, San-min Doctrine, San Min Chu-i, or Tridemism is a political philosophy developed by Sun Yat-sen as part of a philosophy to improve China during the Republican Era. The three principles are often translated into and summarized as nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people (or welfarism). This philosophy has been claimed as the cornerstone of the nation&#x27;s policy as carried by the Kuomintang; the principles also appear in the first line of the national anthem of Taiwan.

==Origins==
When the Revive China Society was formed in 1894, Sun only had two principles: nationalism and democracy. He picked up the third idea, welfare, during his three-year trip to Europe from 1896 to 1898. He announced all three ideas in the spring of 1905, during another trip to Europe. Sun made the first speech of his life on the &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot; in Brussels. He was able to organize the Revive China Society in many European cities. There were about 30 members in the Brussels branch at the time, 20 in Berlin, and 10 in Paris. After the Tongmenghui was formed, Sun published an editorial in &quot;Min Bao&quot; (民報). This was the first time the ideas were expressed in writing. Later on, in the anniversary issue of &quot;Min Bao&quot;, his long speech of the Three Principles was printed, and the editors of the newspaper discussed the issue of people&#x27;s livelihood.

The ideology is said to be heavily influenced by Sun&#x27;s experiences in the United States and contains elements of the American progressive movement and the thought championed by Abraham Lincoln. Sun credited a line from Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address, &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people&quot;, as an inspiration for the Three Principles. Sun&#x27;s Three Principles of the People are inter-connected as the guideline for China&#x27;s modernization development as stretched by Hu Hanmin.

==The Principles==
===&quot;Mínzú&quot; or Nationalism===
Because &quot;Mínzú&quot; or &quot;People&quot; describes a nation rather than a group of persons united by a purpose, the &#x27;Principle of Mínzú&#x27; () is commonly rendered as &quot;nationalism&quot;.

==== National Independence ====
Sun saw the Chinese Nation as under threat of annihilation by the imperialist powers. To reverse the trajectory of such decline, China needed to become nationally independent both externally and internally.

Internally, national independence meant independence from the Qing Manchus who ruled China for centuries. Sun thought that the Han Chinese people were a people without their own nation and thus strove for national revolution against Qing authorities.

Externally, national independence meant independence from imperialist foreign powers. Sun believed China to be threatened by imperialism in three ways: by economic oppression, by political aggression, and by slow population growth. Economically, Sun held the mercantilist position that China was being economically exploited by unbalanced trade and tariffs. Politically, he looked toward the unequal treaties signed by China as the reason of China&#x27;s decline. Sun envisioned a future China that was strong and capable of fighting imperialists and standing on the same stage as western powers.

==== Five Races Under One Union ====

Although Sun initially believed in a form of Han nationalism to oppose the rule of the Qing dynasty, he later came to accept Liang Qichao’s multi-ethnic nationalist idea of a unified Chinese nation. To achieve &quot;national independence&quot;, Sun believed that China must first develop a &quot;China-nationalism,&quot; &quot;Zhonghua Minzu&quot;, as opposed to an mono-ethnic nationalism. Sun developed the principles of Five Races Under One Union to unite the five major ethnic groups of China—Han, Mongols, Tibetans, Manchus, and the Muslims (such as the Uyghurs)—under one &quot;Chinese Nation&quot;. This principle is symbolized by the Five Color Flag of the First Republic of China (1911–1928). He believed that China must develop a &quot;national consciousness&quot; so as to unite the Chinese people in the face of imperialist aggression. He argued that &quot;minzu&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;people&quot;, &quot;nationality&quot;, or &quot;race&quot;, was defined by sharing common blood, livelihood, religion, language, and customs. Sun also believed in a form of interculturalism that assimilated ethnic minorities into the dominant Han culture by a process of naturalization, rather than through brute force.

==== Cultural conservatism ====
The Three Principles of the People were partly related to cultural conservatism (文化保守主義) to defend the virtues of Chinese culture against Western imperialism, while embracing some of the modern elements. Sun Yat-sen defended socialism, but distanced himself from dogmatic Marxism. He criticized young people&#x27;s obsession with Western-style Marxism and saw that similar ideas could be found in Chinese classics. Also, Sun embraced modernism, but at the same time highlighted a positive part of Chinese tradition.

===&quot;Mínquán&quot; or Governance Rights===
The framing of &#x27;democracy&#x27; () in the Three Principles of the People differs from the typical Western view democracy, being based in Liang&#x27;s interpretation of General will, which prioritizes the power of the group over individual freedoms. Sun viewed traditional Chinese society as too individualistic and stated that individual liberty must be broken down so that the Chinese people could pressed together, using the metaphor of adding cement to sand.

==== Four Rights of the People ====
The power of politics () are the powers of the people to express their political wishes and keep administrative officers in check, similar to those vested in the citizenry or the parliaments in other countries, and is represented by the National Assembly. The power of the people is guaranteed by four constitutional rights: the right to election (選舉), recalling (罷免), initiative (創制), and referendum (複決). These may be equated to &quot;civil rights&quot;.

==== Five Power Constitution ====

The power of governance () are the powers of the administration to govern the people. He criticized the traditional three-branch democratic government for vesting too much power in the legislative branch. He expanded and reworked the European-American three-branch government and the system of checks and balances by incorporating traditional Chinese administrative systems to create a government of five branches (each of which is called a Yuan ()) in a system known as the Five Power Constitution. The state is divided into five &quot;Yuan&quot;s: Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Judicial Yuan came from Montesquieuan thought; the Control Yuan and the Examination Yuan came from Chinese tradition. (Note that the Legislative Yuan was first intended as a branch of governance, not strictly equivalent to a national parliament.)

===&quot;Mínshēng&quot; or Welfare Rights===

The Principle of Mínshēng () is sometimes translated as &quot;[Principle of] Government for the People&quot; or &quot;Socialism&quot;. The concept may be understood as social welfare and as a direct criticism of the inadequacies of unregulated capitalism. He divided livelihood into four areas: clothing, food, housing, and mobility; and planned out how an ideal (Chinese) government can take care of these for its people.

==== Equalization of Land Rights ====
Sun was influenced by the American thinker Henry George and intended to introduce a Georgist tax reform. The land value tax in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. Sun said that &quot;[land value tax] as the only means of supporting the government is an infinitely just, reasonable, and equitably distributed tax, and on it we will found our new system.&quot;

Sun proposed a land reform system known as &quot;equalization of land rights&quot;, which involves the implementation of four different acts: regulation of land price, in which each landowner reports the value of their property sans improvement; taxation of land, which involves a land value tax set on all land properties; purchase of land, which sets up a system where government can purchase land for public use by eminent domain; and profit belongs to the public, in which a 100% tax is levied on all profit gained from trading of land (sans improvement). According to Sun, the existence of land purchase and land taxation guarantees that landowner wouldn&#x27;t over-report (which would lead to high taxation on land) nor under-report (which would lead to their land being cheaply acquired for eminent domain) their land values.

However, the Kuomintang failed to achieve any successful land reform Sun envisioned in mainland China and only succeeded in Taiwan.

==== Impact ====
Sun died before he was able to fully explain his vision of this Principle and it has been the subject of much debate within both the Chinese Nationalist and Communist Parties, with the latter suggesting that Sun supported socialism. Chiang Kai-shek further elaborated the Mínshēng principle of both the importance of social well-being and recreational activities for a modernized China in 1953 in Taiwan.

==Canon==

The most definite (canonical) exposition of these principles was a book compiled from notes of speeches that Sun gave near Guangzhou (taken by a colleague, Huang Changgu, in consultation with Sun), and therefore is open to interpretation by various parties and interest groups (see below) and may not have been as fully explicated as Sun might have wished. Indeed, Chiang Kai-shek supplied an annex to the Principle of Mínshēng, covering two additional areas of livelihood: education, land, and leisure, and explicitly arguing that Mínshēng was not to be seen as supporting either communism or socialism.
The French historian of Chinese history, Marie-Claire Bergère&#x27;s view is that the book is a work of propaganda. Its purpose is to appeal to action rather than to thought. As Sun Yat-sen declared, a principle is not simply an idea; it is &quot;a faith, a power.&quot;

==Legacy==
The Three Principles of the People were claimed as the basis for the ideologies of the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek, the Reorganized National Government of China under Wang Jingwei, and an inspiration of the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong as the stage of ‘old democracy’. The Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party largely agreed on the meaning of nationalism but differed sharply on the meaning of democracy and people&#x27;s welfare, which the former saw in Western social democratic terms and the latter interpreted in Marxist and communist terms. The Japanese collaborationist government interpreted nationalism less in terms of anti-imperialism and more in terms of cooperating with Japan to advance theoretically pan-Asian, but in practice, typically Japanese interests.

===Republic of China and Taiwan===

During the Republic of China&#x27;s Nanjing period, the KMT developed a national censorship apparatus as part of its &quot;Arts of the Three Principles of the People&quot; cultural campaign. This program sought to censor cultural products deemed unwelcomed by the KMT, such as works by left-wing artists or writers.

There were several higher-education institutes (university departments/faculties and graduate institutes) in Taiwan that used to devote themselves to the &#x27;research and development&#x27; of the Three Principles in this aspect. Since the late 1990s, these institutes have re-oriented themselves so that other political theories are also admitted as worthy of consideration, and have changed their names to be more ideologically neutral (such as Democratic Studies Institute).

In addition to this institutional phenomenon, many streets and businesses in Taiwan are named &quot;Sān-mín&quot; or for one of the three principles. In contrast to other politically derived street names, there has been no major renaming of these streets or institutions in the 1990s.

Although the term &quot;Sanmin Zhuyi&quot; (三民主義) has been less explicitly invoked since the mid-1980s, no political party has explicitly attacked its principles with practices under the Martial Law ruling era then except the Tangwai movement groups such as Democratic Progressive Party. The Three Principles of the People remains explicitly part of the platform of the Kuomintang and in the Constitution of the Republic of China.

As for Taiwan independence supporters, some have objections regarding the formal constitutional commitment to a particular set of political principles. Also, they have been against the mandatory indoctrination in schools and universities, which have now been abolished in a piecemeal fashion beginning in the late 1990s. However, there is little fundamental hostility to the substantive principles themselves. In these circles, attitudes toward the Three Principles of the People span the spectrum from indifference to reinterpreting the Three Principles of the People in a local Taiwanese context rather than in a pan-Chinese one.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
The Three Principles of the People has been reinterpreted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to argue that communism is a necessary conclusion of the Three Principles of the People and thus provides legitimacy for the communist government. This reinterpretation of the Three Principles of the People is commonly referred to as the New Three Principles of the People (, also translated as Neo-tridemism), a word coined by Mao&#x27;s 1940 essay &quot;On New Democracy,&quot; in which he argued that the CCP is a better enforcer of the Three Principles of the People compared to the bourgeois Nationalist Party and that the new three principles are about allying with the communists and the Russians (Soviets), and supporting peasants and the workers. Proponents of the New Three Principles of the People often claim that Sun&#x27;s book &quot;Three Principles of the People&quot; acknowledges that the principles of welfare is inherently socialistic and communistic.

In response to a question from a Reuters reporter in 1945, CCP chairman Mao Zedong said: &quot;A free and democratic China will be a country in which all levels of government up to the central government are elected by universal, equal, secret suffrage and are accountable to the people who elected them. It would realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Three Principles of the People, Lincoln&#x27;s principles of government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and Roosevelt&#x27;s Four Freedoms. It will guarantee the country&#x27;s independence, unity, unification and cooperation with the democratic powers.&quot;

===Vietnam===
The Vietnam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro-Chinese Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng. The Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng translates directly into Vietnamese Kuomintang (or the Vietnamese Nationalist Party&quot;, and it was largely a resemble of the original Chinese Kuomintang party. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the Three Principles of the People, and opposition to Japanese and French imperialists. The Revolutionary League was controlled by Nguyễn Hải Thần, who was born in Northern Vietnam. General Zhang Fakui blocked the Communists of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh from entering the league, as his main goal was Chinese influence in Indochina. The KMT utilized these Vietnamese nationalists during World War II against Japanese forces.

The motto of Independence - Freedom - Happiness of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, despite its communist political background, was also taken from the Three Principles of People.

===Tibet===
The pro-Kuomintang and pro-ROC Khamba revolutionary leader Pandatsang Rapga, who established the Tibet Improvement Party, adopted Dr. Sun&#x27;s ideology including the Three Principles, incorporating them into his party and using Sun&#x27;s doctrine as a model for his vision of Tibet after achieving his goal of overthrowing the Tibetan government.

Pandatsang Rapga hailed the Three Principles of for helping Asian peoples against foreign imperialism and called for the feudal system to be overthrown. Rapga stated that &quot;The Sanmin Zhuyi was intended for all peoples under the domination of foreigners, for all those who had been deprived of the rights of man. But it was conceived especially for the Asians. It is for this reason that I translated it. At that time, a lot of new ideas were spreading in Tibet&quot;, during an interview in 1975 with Heather Stoddard. Sun&#x27;s ideology was put into a Tibetan translation by Rapga. 

He believed that change in Tibet would only be possible in a manner similar to when the Qing dynasty was overthrown in China. He borrowed the theories and ideas of the Kuomintang as the basis for his model for Tibet. The party was funded by the Kuomintang and by the Pandatsang family.

===Singapore===
The establishment of the People&#x27;s Power Party in May 2015 by opposition politician Goh Meng Seng marks the first time in contemporary Singaporean politics that a political party was formed with the Three Principles of the People and its system of having five branches of government as espoused by Sun Yat-Sen as its official guiding ideology.

The People&#x27;s Power Party has adapted the ideas with a slight modification to the concepts of the Five Powers in order to stay relevant to modern contemporary political and social structures. The emphasis is put on the separation of the Five Powers which naturally means the separation of certain institutions from the Executive&#x27;s control.

The power of impeachment (originally under the Control Yuan) has been expanded to include various contemporary functional government institutions. Examples include the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, advocacy of the Ombudsman Commission, Equal Opportunity Commission, freedom of the press and freedom of speech.

The power of examination has been adapted and modified to fit the modern concept of selection for both political leaders as well as civil servants. This involves institutions like the Elections Department and Public Service Commission.

The People&#x27;s Power Party advocates that the institutions included in these two powers, namely the power of impeachment and the power of selection, be put under the supervision of Singapore&#x27;s elected president.

<text>Wang Zhaoming (4 May 188310 November 1944), widely known by his pen name Wang Jingwei, was a Chinese politician who was president of the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state of the Empire of Japan. He was initially a member of the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT), leading a government in Wuhan in opposition to the right-wing Nationalist government in Nanjing, but later became increasingly anti-communist after his efforts to collaborate with the Chinese Communist Party ended in political failure.

Wang was a close associate of Sun Yat-sen for the last twenty years of Sun&#x27;s life. After Sun&#x27;s death in 1925, Wang engaged in a political struggle with Chiang Kai-shek for control over the Kuomintang, but lost. Wang remained inside the Kuomintang, but continued to have disagreements with Chiang. Following the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Wang accepted an invitation from the Japanese to form a collaborationist government in Nanjing, of which he served as the head of state until his death shortly before the End of World War II in Asia. His legacy remains controversial among historians. Although he is still regarded as an important contributor in the 1911 Revolution, his collaboration with Imperial Japan is a subject of academic debate, and the typical narratives often regard him as a traitor with his name becoming synonymous with treason.

==Early life and education==
Born in Sanshui, Guangdong, but of Zhejiang origin, Wang went to Japan as an international student sponsored by the Qing Dynasty government in 1903, and joined the Tongmenghui in 1905. He also adopted the sobriquet &quot;Wang Jingwei&quot; in 1905.

As a young man, Wang came to blame the Qing dynasty for holding China back, and making it too weak to fight off exploitation by Western imperialist powers. Wang studied in Japan, where he cut off his queue and embraced theories of democracy and liberalism. While in Japan, Wang became a close confidant of Sun Yat-sen, and would later go on to become one of the most important members of the early Kuomintang. He was among the Chinese nationalists in Japan who were influenced by Russian anarchism, and published a number of articles in journals edited by Zhang Renjie, Wu Zhihui, and the group of Chinese anarchists in Paris.

Japan&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War impressed Wang, and influenced his view of nationalism as an ideology that could unite a country around the idea of self-strengthening.

==Early career==
In the years leading up to the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, Wang was active in opposing the Qing government. Wang gained prominence during this period as an excellent public speaker and a staunch advocate of Chinese nationalism.

Wang was part of a Tongmenghui cell which attempted to assassinate the regent, Prince Chun. Wang and Chen Bijun were betrothed and informally married shortly before the assassination attempt. The bomb that Wang and his cell planted was discovered, and Wang and two others who planned the assassination were arrested two weeks later. Wang readily admitted his guilt at trial and was not repentant. Wang was sentenced to life imprisonment.

A number of factors may have contributed to Wang&#x27;s receiving a life sentence instead of being executed. Shanqi (Prince Su) was believed to have been moved by Wang&#x27;s confession. In his view, leniency would show the government&#x27;s magnanimity and its commitment to reform. Additionally, Shanqi&#x27;s advisor Cheng Jiacheng was an undercover Tongmenghui agent and there were other sympathetic officials. Finally, Tongmenghui leaders threatened reprisals if Wang were executed, and these threats may have had an intimidating effect on government officials.

He remained in jail from 1910 until the Wuchang Uprising the next year, when he was freed as part of a general amnesty for political prisoners, and became something of a national hero upon his release. A book of poems written by Wang during his incarceration was published after his release and became widely popular.

During and after the Xinhai Revolution, Wang&#x27;s political life was defined by his opposition to Western imperialism.

Wang was a part of the Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement.

While Wang was living in France in 1913, the Kuomintang&#x27;s (KMT) parliamentary leader Song Jiaoren was shot and died two days later. Yuan Shikai was alleged to have been responsible for the assassination. Sun Yat-Sen summoned Wang back to China shortly thereafter.

Wang attended the post-World War I Paris Peace Conference as an observer, having declined to take a formal role with one of the competing Chinese delegations to avoid compromising his impartiality. He was outraged by the diplomatic fiasco that unfolded at the conference and the European powers&#x27; treatment of China.

In the early 1920s, he held several posts in Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s Revolutionary Government in Guangzhou, and was the only member of Sun&#x27;s inner circle to accompany him on trips outside of KMT-held territory in the months immediately preceding Sun&#x27;s death. He is believed by many to have drafted Sun&#x27;s will during the short period before Sun&#x27;s death, in the winter of 1925.

He was considered one of the main contenders to replace Sun as leader of the KMT, but eventually lost control of the party and army to Chiang Kai-shek. At this time, Wang&#x27;s view was that the KMT should be the lead party in a democratic coalition based on constitutionalism and that it should guide mass movements to change China&#x27;s social structure.

Wang had clearly lost control of the KMT by 1926, when, following the Zhongshan Warship Incident, Chiang successfully sent Wang and his family to vacation in Europe. It was important for Chiang to have Wang away from Guangdong while Chiang was in the process of expelling communists from the KMT because Wang was then the leader of the left wing of the KMT, notably sympathetic to communists and communism, and may have opposed Chiang if he had remained in China.

==Rivalry with Chiang Kai-shek==
===Leader of the Wuhan Government===
During the Northern Expedition, Wang was the leading figure in the left-leaning faction of the KMT that called for continued cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party. Although Wang collaborated closely with Chinese communists in Wuhan, he was philosophically opposed to communism and regarded the KMT&#x27;s Comintern advisors with suspicion. He did not believe that Communists could be true patriots or true Chinese nationalists.

In early 1927, shortly before Chiang captured Shanghai and moved the capital to Nanjing, Wang&#x27;s faction declared the capital of the Republic to be Wuhan. While attempting to direct the government from Wuhan, Wang was notable for his close collaboration with leading communist figures, including Mao Zedong, Chen Duxiu, and Borodin, and for his faction&#x27;s provocative land reform policies. Wang later blamed the failure of his Wuhan government on its excessive adoption of communist agendas. Wang&#x27;s regime was opposed by Chiang Kai-shek, who was in the midst of a bloody purge of communists in Shanghai and was calling for a push farther north. The separation between the governments of Wang and Chiang are known as the &quot;Ninghan Separation&quot; ().

Chiang Kai-shek occupied Shanghai in April 1927, and began a bloody suppression of suspected communists known as the &quot;Shanghai Massacre&quot;. Within several weeks of Chiang&#x27;s suppression of communists in Shanghai, Wang&#x27;s leftist government was attacked by a KMT-aligned warlord and promptly disintegrated, leaving Chiang as the sole legitimate leader of the Republic. KMT troops occupying territories formerly controlled by Wang conducted massacres of suspected Communists in many areas: around Changsha alone, over ten thousand people were killed in a single twenty-day period. Fearing retribution as a communist sympathizer, Wang publicly claimed allegiance to Chiang before fleeing to Europe.

===Political activities in Chiang&#x27;s government===
Between 1929 and 1930, Wang collaborated with Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan to form a central government in opposition to the one headed by Chiang. Wang took part in a conference hosted by Yan to draft a new constitution, and was to serve as the Prime Minister under Yan, who would be president. Wang&#x27;s attempts to aid Yan&#x27;s government ended when Chiang defeated the alliance in the Central Plains War.

In 1931, Wang joined another anti-Chiang government in Guangzhou. After Chiang defeated this regime, Wang reconciled with Chiang&#x27;s Nanjing government and held prominent posts for most of the decade. Wang was appointed premier just as the Battle of Shanghai (1932) began. He had frequent disputes with Chiang and would resign in protest several times only to have his resignation rescinded. As a result of these power struggles within the KMT, Wang was forced to spend much of his time in exile. He traveled to Germany, and maintained some contact with Adolf Hitler. As the leader of the Kuomintang&#x27;s left-wing faction and a man who had been closely associated with Dr. Sun, Chiang wanted Wang as premier both to protect the &quot;progressive&quot; reputation of his government which was waging a civil war with the Communists and a shield for protecting his government from widespread public criticism of Chiang&#x27;s policy of &quot;first internal pacification, then external resistance&quot; (i.e. first defeat the Communists, then confront Japan). Despite the fact that Wang and Chiang disliked and distrusted each other, Chiang was prepared to make compromises to keep Wang on as premier. In regards to Japan, Wang and Chiang differed in that Wang was extremely pessimistic about China&#x27;s ability to win the coming war with Japan (which almost everyone in 1930s China regarded as inevitable) and was opposed to alliances with any foreign powers should the war come.

While being opposed to any effort at this time to subordinate China to Japan, Wang also saw the &quot;white powers&quot; like the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States as equal if not greater dangers to China, insisting that China had to defeat Japan solely by its own efforts if the Chinese were to hope to maintain their independence. But at the same time, Wang&#x27;s belief that China was too economically backward at present to win a war against a Japan which had been aggressively modernizing since the Meiji Restoration of 1867 made him the advocate of avoiding war with Japan at almost any cost and trying to negotiate some sort of an agreement with Japan which would preserve China&#x27;s independence. Chiang by contrast believed that if his modernization program was given enough time, China would win the coming war and that if the war came before his modernization plans were complete, he was willing to ally with any foreign power to defeat Japan, even including the Soviet Union, which was supporting the Chinese Communists in the civil war. Chiang was much more of a hardline anti-Communist than was Wang, but Chiang was also a self-proclaimed &quot;realist&quot; who was willing if necessary to have an alliance with the Soviet Union. Though in the short-run, Wang and Chiang agreed on the policy of &quot;first internal pacification, then external resistance&quot;, in the long-run they differed as Wang was more of an appeaser while Chiang just wanted to buy time to modernize China for the coming war. The effectiveness of the KMT was constantly hindered by leadership and personal struggles, such as that between Wang and Chiang. In December 1935, Wang permanently left the premiership after being seriously wounded during an assassination attempt engineered a month earlier by Wang Yaqiao.

In 1936, Wang clashed with Chiang over foreign policy. In an ironic role reversal, the left-wing &quot;progressive&quot; Wang argued for accepting the German-Japanese offer of having China sign the Anti-Comintern Pact while the right-wing &quot;reactionary&quot; Chiang wanted a rapprochement with the Soviet Union. During the 1936 Xi&#x27;an Incident, in which Chiang was taken prisoner by his own general, Zhang Xueliang, Wang favored sending a &quot;punitive expedition&quot; to attack Zhang. He was apparently ready to march on Zhang, but Chiang&#x27;s wife, Soong Mei-ling, and brother-in-law, T. V. Soong, feared that such an action would lead to Chiang&#x27;s death and his replacement by Wang, so they successfully opposed this action.

Wang accompanied the government on its retreat to Chongqing during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945). During this time, he organized some right-wing groups along European fascist lines inside the KMT. Wang was originally part of the pro-war group; but, after the Japanese were successful in occupying large areas of coastal China, Wang became known for his pessimistic view on China&#x27;s chances in the war against Japan. He often voiced defeatist opinions in KMT staff meetings, and continued to express his view that Western imperialism was the greater danger to China, much to the chagrin of his associates. Wang believed that China needed to reach a negotiated settlement with Japan so that Asia could resist Western Powers.

==Rival presidency and alliance with the Axis Powers==
In late 1938, Wang left Chongqing for Hanoi, French Indochina, where he stayed for three months and announced his support for a negotiated settlement with the Japanese. During this time, he was wounded in an assassination attempt by KMT agents. Wang then flew to Shanghai, where he entered negotiations with Japanese authorities. The Japanese invasion had given him the opportunity he had long sought to establish a new government outside of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s control.

On 30 March 1940, Wang became the head of state of what came to be known as the Wang Jingwei regime (formally &quot;the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China&quot;) based in Nanjing, serving as the President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the National Government (). In November 1940, Wang&#x27;s government signed the &quot;Sino-Japanese Treaty&quot; with the Japanese, a document that has been compared with Japan&#x27;s Twenty-one Demands for its broad political, military, and economic concessions. In June 1941, Wang gave a public radio address from Tokyo in which he praised Japan and affirmed China&#x27;s submission to it while criticizing the Kuomintang government, and pledged to work with the Empire of Japan to resist Communism and Western imperialism. Wang continued to orchestrate politics within his regime in concert with Chiang&#x27;s international relationship with foreign powers, seizing the French Concession and the International Settlement of Shanghai in 1943, after Western nations agreed by consensus to abolish extraterritoriality.

The Government of National Salvation of the collaborationist &quot;Republic of China&quot;, which Wang headed, was established on the Three Principles of Pan-Asianism, anti-communism, and opposition to Chiang Kai-shek. Wang continued to maintain his contacts with German Nazis and Italian fascists he had established while in exile.

==Administration of the Wang Jingwei regime==

Chinese under the regime had greater access to coveted wartime luxuries, and the Japanese enjoyed things like matches, rice, tea, coffee, cigars, foods, and alcoholic drinks, all of which were scarce in Japan proper, but consumer goods became more scarce after Japan entered World War II. In Japan-occupied Chinese territories, the prices of basic necessities rose substantially, as Japan&#x27;s war effort expanded. In Shanghai in 1941, they increased elevenfold.
Daily life was often difficult in the Nanjing Nationalist government-controlled Republic of China, and grew more so as the war turned against Japan (). Local residents resorted to the black market to obtain needed items. The Japanese Kempeitai, Tokko, collaborationist Chinese police, and Chinese citizens in the service of the Japanese all worked to censor information, monitor any opposition, and torture enemies and dissenters. A &quot;native&quot; secret agency, the &quot;Tewu&quot;, was created with the aid of Japanese Army &quot;advisors&quot;. The Japanese also established prisoner-of-war detention centers, concentration camps, and kamikaze training centers to indoctrinate pilots.

Since Wang&#x27;s government held authority only over territories under Japanese military occupation, there was a limited amount that officials loyal to Wang could do to ease the suffering of Chinese under Japanese occupation. Wang himself became a focal point of anti-Japanese resistance. He was demonized and branded as an &quot;arch-traitor&quot; in both KMT and Communist propaganda. Wang and his government were deeply unpopular with the Chinese populace, who regarded them as traitors to both the Chinese state and Han Chinese identity. Wang&#x27;s rule was constantly undermined by resistance and sabotage.

The strategy of the local education system was to create a workforce suited for employment in factories and mines, and for manual labor in general. The Japanese also attempted to introduce their culture and dress to the Chinese. Complaints and agitation called for more meaningful Chinese educational development. Shinto temples and similar cultural centers were built in order to instill Japanese culture and values. These activities came to a halt at the end of the war.

==Death==
In March 1944, Wang left for Japan to undergo medical treatment for the wound left by an assassination attempt in 1939. He died in Nagoya on 10 November 1944, less than a year before Japan&#x27;s surrender to the Allies. Many of his senior followers who lived to see the end of the war were executed. His death was not reported in occupied China until the afternoon of 12 November, after commemorative events for Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s birth had concluded. Contrary to a number of secondary accounts, Wang was not buried near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in an elaborately-constructed mausoleum. Instead, he was buried on Plum Flower Mountain, near the mausoleums of the Ming dynasty, in a small, temporary tomb consisting of only a circular grass topped mound eight metres wide and four metres high, a makeshift wooden structure and a sign reading &quot;Wang Jingwei&#x27;s tomb&quot;. Wang was to be moved to Canton for final burial below Pakwan Mountain upon the reunification of the country under the Nanking government. Soon after Japan&#x27;s defeat, the Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-shek moved its capital back to Nanjing, destroyed Wang&#x27;s tomb, and burned the body. Today, the site is commemorated with a small pavilion that notes Wang as a traitor.

==Legacy==
For his role in the Pacific War, Wang has been considered a traitor by most post-World War II Chinese historians in both Taiwan and mainland China. His name has become a for &quot;traitor&quot; or &quot;treason&quot; in mainland China and Taiwan. In their rhetoric, the communist and nationalist governments would both go on to eviscerate Wang for his collaboration with the Japanese. The Communist Party emphasized his anti-communism while the Kuomintang downplayed it—instead focusing on his personal betrayal of Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, the communists purported that his high rank within the KMT demonstrated a duplicitous, treasonous nature inherent to the nationalist party. Both sides chose to minimize his earlier association with Sun Yat-sen.

==Personal life==
Wang was married to Chen Bijun. They were betrothed and had an informal wedding shortly before the assassination attempt on Prince Chun and were formally married in 1912. The couple had six children, five of whom survived into adulthood. Of those who survived into adulthood, Wang&#x27;s eldest son Ying (later changed to Wenying) was born in France in 1913. Wang&#x27;s eldest daughter, Wenxing, was born in France in 1915, worked as a teacher in Hong Kong after 1948, retired to the US in 1984 and died in 2015. Wang&#x27;s second daughter, Wang Wenbin, was born in 1920. Wang&#x27;s third daughter, Wenxun, was born in Guangzhou in 1922 and died in 2002 in Hong Kong. Wang&#x27;s second son, Wenti, was born in 1928 and was sentenced in 1946 to 18 months&#x27; imprisonment for being a &quot;hanjian&quot;. After serving his sentence, Wang Wenti settled in Hong Kong where he was involved in numerous education projects with the mainland starting in the 1980s.

<text>Classical Chinese is the language in which the classics of Chinese literature were written, from . For millennia thereafter, the written Chinese used in these works was imitated and iterated upon by scholars in a form now called Literary Chinese, which was used for almost all formal writing in China until the early 20th century. Each written character corresponds to a single spoken syllable, and almost always to a single independent word. As a result, the characteristic style of the language is comparatively terse.

Starting in the 2nd century CE, use of Literary Chinese spread to the countries surrounding China, including Vietnam, Korea, Japan, and the Ryukyu Islands, where it represented the only known form of writing. Literary Chinese was adopted as the language of civil administration in these countries, creating what is known as the Sinosphere. Each additionally developed systems of readings and annotations that enabled non-Chinese speakers to interpret Literary Chinese texts in terms of the local vernacular.

While not static throughout its history, its evolution has traditionally been guided by a conservative impulse: many later changes in the varieties of Chinese are not reflected in the literary form. Due to millennia of this evolution, Literary Chinese is only partially intelligible when read or spoken aloud for someone only familiar with modern vernacular forms. Literary Chinese has largely been replaced by written vernacular Chinese among Chinese speakers; speakers of non-Chinese languages have similarly abandoned Literary Chinese in favour of their own local vernaculars. Although varieties of Chinese have diverged in various directions from the Old Chinese words in the Classical lexicon, many cognates can still be found.

== Definition ==

There is no universal agreement on the definition of &quot;Classical Chinese&quot;. At its core, the term refers to the language used by the classics of Chinese literature roughly from the 5th century BCE to the end of the Han dynasty (202 BCE220 CE). The form of Chinese used in works written before the 4th century BCE, like the Five Classics, is distinct from that found in later works. The term &quot;pre-Classical Chinese&quot; is used to distinguish this earlier form from Classical Chinese proper, as it did not inspire later imitation to a comparable degree despite the works&#x27; equal importance in the canon.

After the Han dynasty, the divergence of spoken language from the literary form became increasingly apparent. The term &quot;Literary Chinese&quot; has been coined to refer to the later forms of written Chinese in conscious imitation of the classics, with sinologists generally emphasizing distinctions such as the gradual addition of new vocabulary and the erosion of certain points of Classical grammar as their functions were forgotten. Literary Chinese was used in almost all formal and personal writing in China from the end of the Han dynasty until the early 20th century, when it was largely replaced by written vernacular Chinese. A distinct, narrower definition of the Classical period begins with the life of Confucius (551–479 BCE) and ends with the founding of the Qin dynasty in 221 BCE.

== Function ==

The adoption of Chinese literary culture in the Sinosphere amid the existence of various regional vernaculars is an example of &quot;diglossia&quot;. The coexistence of Literary Chinese and native languages throughout China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam can be compared to the historical literary use of Latin in Europe, that of Old Church Slavonic in the Eastern Orthodox world, that of Arabic in Persia, or that of Sanskrit in South and Southeast Asia. However, unlike these examples, written Chinese uses a logography of Chinese characters that are not directly tied to their pronunciation. This lack of a fixed correspondence between writing and reading created a situation where later readings of Classical Chinese texts were able to diverge much further from their originals than occurred in the other literary traditions, adding a unique dimension to the study of Literary Chinese. 

Literary Chinese was adopted in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. The &quot;Oxford Handbook of Classical Chinese Literature&quot; states that this adoption came mainly from diplomatic and cultural ties with China, while conquest, colonization, and migration played smaller roles. Unlike Latin and Sanskrit, historical Chinese language theory consisted almost exclusively of lexicography, as opposed to the study of grammar and syntax. Such approaches largely arrived with Europeans beginning in the 17th century. Christian missionaries later coined the term to describe Classical Chinese; this term never became widely used among domestic speakers.

=== Transmission of texts ===
According to the traditional &quot;burning of books and burying of scholars&quot; account, in 213 BCE Qin Shi Huang ordered the historical records of all non-Qin states to be burned, along with any literature associated with the Hundred Schools of Thought. The imperial library was destroyed upon the dynasty&#x27;s collapse in 206 BCE, resulting in a potentially greater loss. Even works from the Classical period that have survived are not known to exist in their original forms, and are attested only in manuscripts copied centuries after their original composition. The &quot;Yiwenzhi&quot; section of the &quot;Book of Han&quot; (111 CE) is the oldest extant bibliography of Classical Chinese, compiled ; only 6% of its 653 listed works are known to exist in a complete form, with another 6% existing only in fragments.

== Grammar and lexicon ==

Compared to written vernacular Chinese, Classical Chinese is terse and compact in its style, and uses some different vocabulary. Classical Chinese rarely uses words two or more characters in length.

Classical Chinese can be described as a pro-drop language: its syntax often allows either subjects or objects to be dropped when their reference is understood. Additionally, words are generally not restricted to use as certain parts of speech: many characters may function as either a noun, verb, or adjective. There is no general copula in Classical Chinese akin to how is used in modern Standard Chinese. Characters that can sometimes function as a copula in specific circumstances include (; &#x27;make&#x27;, &#x27;do&#x27;) when indicating temporary circumstances, and (; &#x27;say&#x27;) when used in the sense of &#x27;to be called&#x27;.

Classical Chinese has more pronouns compared to the modern vernacular. In particular, whereas modern Standard Chinese has one character generally used as a first-person pronoun, Classical Chinese has several—many of which are used as part of a system of honorifics. Many final and interrogative particles are found in Classical Chinese.

Beyond differences in grammar and vocabulary, Classical Chinese can be distinguished by its literary qualities: an effort to maintain parallelism and rhythm is typical, even in prose works. Works also make extensive use of literary techniques such as allusion, which contributes to the language&#x27;s brevity.

== Modern use ==
Prior to the literary revolution in China that began with the 1919 May Fourth Movement, prominent examples of vernacular Chinese literature include the 18th-century novel &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. Most government documents in the Republic of China were written in Literary Chinese until reforms spearheaded by President Yen Chia-kan in the 1970s to shift to written vernacular Chinese. However, most of the laws of Taiwan are still written in a subset of Literary Chinese. As a result, it is necessary for modern Taiwanese lawyers to learn at least a subset of the literary language.

Many works of literature in Classical and Literary Chinese have been highly influential in Chinese culture, such as the canon of Tang poetry. However, even with knowledge of its grammar and vocabulary, works in Literary Chinese can be difficult for native vernacular speakers to understand, due to its frequent allusions and references to other historical literature, as well as the extremely laconic style. Presently, pure Literary Chinese is occasionally used in formal or ceremonial contexts. For example, the &quot;National Anthem of the Republic of China&quot; is in Literary Chinese. Buddhist texts in Literary Chinese are still preserved from the time they were composed or translated from Sanskrit. In practice there is a socially accepted continuum between vernacular and Literary Chinese. For example, most official notices and formal letters use stock literary expressions within vernacular prose.

Personal use of Classical phrases depends on factors such as the subject matter and the level of education of the writer. Excepting professional scholars and enthusiasts, most modern writers cannot easily write in Literary Chinese. Even so, most Chinese people with at least a middle school education are able to basic Literary Chinese, because this ability is part of the Chinese middle school and high school curricula, and is a component of the college entrance examination. Literary Chinese in the school curriculum is taught primarily by presenting a literary work and including a vernacular gloss that explains the meaning of phrases. The examinations usually require the student to read a paragraph in Literary Chinese and then explain its meaning in the vernacular.

Contemporary use of Literary Chinese in Japan is mainly in the field of education and the study of literature. Learning , the Japanese readings of Literary Chinese, is part of the high school curriculum in Japan. Japan is the only country that maintains the tradition of creating Literary Chinese poetry based on Tang-era tone patterns.

== Phonology ==

Chinese characters are not phonetic and rarely reflect later sound changes in words. Efforts to reconstruct Old Chinese pronunciation began relatively recently. Literary Chinese is not read with a reconstructed Old Chinese pronunciation; instead, it is read with the pronunciations as categorized and listed in a rime dictionary originally based upon the Middle Chinese pronunciation in Luoyang between the 2nd and 4th centuries. Over time, each dynasty updated and modified the official rime dictionary: by the time of the Yuan and Ming dynasties, its phonology reflected that of early Mandarin. As the imperial examination system required the candidate to compose poetry in the &quot;shi&quot; genre, pronunciation in non-Mandarin speaking parts of China such as Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian is either based on everyday speech, such as in Standard Cantonese, or is based on a special set of pronunciations borrowed from Classical Chinese, such as in Southern Min. In practice, all varieties of Chinese combine the two extremes of pronunciation: that according to a prescribed system, versus that based on everyday speech. Mandarin and Cantonese, for example, also have words that are pronounced one way in colloquial usage and another way when used in Literary Chinese or in specialized terms coming from Literary Chinese, though the system is not as extensive as that of Min or Wu.

Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese readers of Literary Chinese each use distinct systems of pronunciation specific to their own languages. Japanese speakers have readings of Chinese origin called for many words, such as for &quot;ginko&quot; () or &quot;Tokyo&quot; (), but use when the kanji represents a native word such as the reading of in () or the reading of both characters in &quot;Osaka&quot; (), as well as a system that aids Japanese speakers with a Classical word order.

As pronunciation in modern varieties is different from Old Chinese as well as other historical forms such as Middle Chinese, characters that once rhymed may not any longer, or vice versa. Poetry and other rhyme-based writing thus becomes less coherent than the original reading must have been. However, some modern Chinese varieties have certain phonological characteristics that are closer to the older pronunciations than others, as shown by the preservation of certain rhyme structures.

Another particular characteristic of Literary Chinese is its present homophony. Reading Classical texts with character pronunciations from modern languages results in many homophonous characters that originally had distinct Old Chinese pronunciations, but have since merged to varying degrees. This phenomenon is far more common in Chinese languages than in English: for example, each of the following words had a distinct Old Chinese pronunciation, but are now perfectly homophones with a pronunciation of in Standard Chinese:

The poem &quot;Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den&quot; was composed during the 1930s by the linguist Yuen Ren Chao to demonstrate this: it contains only words pronounced with various tones in modern Standard Chinese. The poem underlines how language had become impractical for modern speakers: when spoken aloud, Literary Chinese is largely incomprehensible. However, the poem is perfectly comprehensible when read, and also uses homophones that were present even in Old Chinese.

Romanizations have been devised to provide distinct spellings for Literary Chinese words, together with pronunciation rules for various modern varieties. The earliest was the &quot;&quot; by French missionaries of the Paris Foreign Missions Society and Ernest Jasmin, based on Middle Chinese, followed by linguist Wang Li&#x27;s based on Old Chinese in 1940, and then by Chao&#x27;s General Chinese romanization in 1975. However, none of these systems have seen extensive use.

<text>Adam Again was an American rock band active from 1982 until the death of founder, leader and vocalist Gene Eugene in 2000. Other band members included Riki Michele on vocals, Paul Valadez on bass, Jon Knox on drums, and Greg Lawless on guitar. Dan Michaels often played saxophone.

Thom Jurek of AllMusic described the group as &quot;inventive and artfully canny.&quot; Mark Allan Powell maintained that the group &quot;priortized musical excellence and lyrical depth over commercial appeal or even accessibility.&quot; The band never achieved commercial viability and disbanded when Eugene was found dead in his recording studio on March 20, 2000 from an undiagnosed brain aneurism. Valadez died on September 20, 2013.

<text>Leigh Anne Bingham Nash ( ; born June 27, 1976) is an American singer and songwriter who is the lead vocalist for the Christian alternative rock band Sixpence None the Richer and was also a member of Fauxliage. Her debut solo album, &quot;Blue on Blue&quot;, was released in August 2006. Nash has released two other solo albums in 2011 and 2015. Nash has two Grammy nominations: &quot;Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Best Rock Gospel Album&quot; in 1998. 

== Early life ==
Nash was born Leigh Anne Bingham in New Braunfels, Texas. She started singing country music and learning old country songs on the guitar at the age of 12. She had several years experience singing in local cafes with a band and performed regularly at a Texan country &amp; western dance hall. She met guitarist and songwriter Matt Slocum at a church retreat in the early 1990s.

== Career ==
Leigh Nash and Matt Slocum formed Sixpence None the Richer (named for a line from the book &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; by the author C.S. Lewis) soon after and went on to record four full-length albums with the band. Their first album, released when she was age 17, was &quot;The Fatherless &amp; the Widow&quot;. The album garnered critical acclaim and Slocum and Nash searched for new band members.

Joined by Tess Wiley, Dale Baker, and J.J. Plascencio, the new band recorded &quot;This Beautiful Mess&quot;, which won a Dove Award for Best Album. Wiley quit the band after their US tour and the band released the &quot;Tickets for a Prayer Wheel&quot; EP and then signed to the Squint Records label following the demise of R.E.X.
The band&#x27;s eponymous album was released in 1997 and the single &quot;Kiss Me&quot; in 1999. In 1999 they received numerous Dove Awards, including Best Artist of the Year. The band was also nominated for a Grammy Award. A second single, a cover of the La&#x27;s &quot;There She Goes&quot;, also hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, followed by a third single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Catch You&quot;.

In 2000, Nash sang the song &quot;Need to Be Next to You&quot; for the movie &quot;Bounce&quot;. Written by Diane Warren, it became Nash&#x27;s first solo single.

After the departure of drummer Dale Baker and bass player J.J. Plascencio, Sixpence None the Richer released &quot;Divine Discontent&quot; in 2001. Two singles from that album, &quot;Breathe Your Name&quot; and a cover of Crowded House&#x27;s 1986 hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot;, charted on the US Adult Top 40 at No. 18 and No. 9, respectively.

In 2003, the band appeared on an episode of the final season of the ABC sitcom &quot;Sabrina, The Teenage Witch&quot;.

In 2004, Sixpence None the Richer announced their breakup by letter from Matt Slocum to &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;. After that, the band released &quot;The Best of Sixpence None the Richer&quot;. Nash and her husband left their Nashville home of 10 years and moved to Los Angeles.

Nash released her first solo record, &quot;Blue on Blue&quot;, in August 2006 on One Son Records, Nash&#x27;s own imprint label through Nettwerk Productions. The first single, &quot;My Idea of Heaven&quot;, was released to U.S. radio the week of July 14, 2006, and the song &quot;Ocean Size Love&quot; was to be the second single, but it was a promo release only. She has also recorded a song &quot;Mirrors and Smoke&quot; with the band Jars of Clay on their album &quot;Good Monsters&quot; the same year. She also performed the song &quot;A Place for Us&quot; (written by Bryan Adams) with Tyler James for the 2007 Disney film &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot;.

In 2007, Nash began a new band, Fauxliage, with Canadian band Delerium, which released a self-titled album on August 14, 2007. Nash, Megan Thompson and Kate York also started a Christian band called Thompson, York &amp; Nash. They worked on a few songs that have been put on MySpace. However, none of the songs posted on their MySpace page have been formally released.

In January 2008 Nash traveled to New Zealand for the annual Parachute Music Festival, where she performed acoustic covers of Sixpence None the Richer hits &quot;Kiss Me &quot; and &quot;There She Goes&quot;. In late 2008, Nash toured with Delerium.

Nash has since rejoined Sixpence and worked on a new EP &quot;My Dear Machine EP&quot;, and the Christmas album &quot;The Dawn of Grace&quot;. Guitarist Tess Wiley returned to the band to support them on a European tour.

Nash joined Open Wings-Broken Strings tour in late 2009, along with Ed Kowalczyk of Live and Art Alexakis of Everclear. In 2011 she released a worship album entitled &quot;Hymns and Sacred Songs&quot;, and in August 2012, she released &quot;Lost in Transition&quot;, her sixth studio album with Sixpence None the Richer.

On September 18, 2015, Nash released her album: &quot;The State I&#x27;m In&quot;. She writes for BMG.

In 2018, Nash released a cover of the Pretenders&#x27; 1986 single &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Me Wrong&quot;. In an interview, Nash stated that new music will be coming soon and will be crowd-funded. On August 25, 2021, Nash announced &quot;The Tide&quot;, a six-song project, would be released September 24 and would feature collaborations with Vince Gill, Tanya Tucker, CeCe Winans, Ruby Amanfu, Raul Malo and Stephen Wilson Jr.

In July 2023, it was announced that Nash would be joining 10,000 Maniacs as their new lead singer. In January 2024, it was announced that Nash would be leaving 10,000 Maniacs, with Mary Ramsey returning to the band as lead singer.

== Inspiration ==
Nash has two distinct poles of inspiration: her work with Sixpence in the Christian music sphere and her childhood fascination with older female country artists like Tanya Tucker, Loretta Lynn, and Patsy Cline.

&quot;I started singing country music and learning old country songs on the guitar when I was 12. I was really, really shy but just had this desire to get on stage and started calling clubs myself to ask if I could come down and sing,&quot; says Nash, who grew up in the Texas Hill Country town of New Braunfels.

Before long, the adolescent Nash was singing Loretta Lynn and Tanya Tucker songs like &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Woman Enough to Take My Man&quot; and &quot;Texas When I Die&quot; on alcohol-free, open mic Sunday nights, backed by a middle-aged band of town locals. Later in life her interest in pop acts like the Sundays, Innocence Mission, and the Cranberries provided more formative material for her songwriting and singing.

== Personal life ==
Nash is the younger of two sisters. In May 1996, she married PFR drummer Mark Nash, whom she met while both bands were performing at the Cornerstone Festival in Illinois. They have a son together, who was born in 2004. The couple divorced in 2007. Nash married musician Stephen Wilson Jr in 2011.

==History==

Four Indian trails came together at a bend of the Beaverhead River north of the present school building in Twin Bridges. These trails were used by early settlers and freight companies, and helped to establish where the community of Twin Bridges would develop. Judge M.H. Lott came to Montana in 1862, and with his brother John T. Lott settled in the Ruby Valley in 1864. In 1865 they built a bridge across the Beaverhead River, and later built another bridge across the Beaverhead at the Point of Rocks. The Lott brothers continued development of roads and promoted settlement of the town, which was incorporated in 1902, with M.H. Lott as the first mayor.

<text>Virginia City is a town in and the county seat of Madison County, Montana, United States. In 1961 the town and the surrounding area were designated a National Historic Landmark District, the Virginia City Historic District. The population was 219 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Founding===

In May 1863, a group of prospectors were headed toward the Yellowstone River and instead came upon a party of the Crow people and were forced to return to Bannack. On May 26, 1863, Bill Fairweather and Henry Edgar discovered gold near Alder Creek. The prospectors could not keep the site a secret and were followed on their return to the gold-bearing site. A mining district was set up in order to formulate rules about individual gold claims. On June 16, 1863, the township was formed under the name of &quot;Verina&quot; a mile south of the gold fields. The name was intended to honor Varina Howell Davis, the first and only First Lady of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Verina, although in Union territory, was founded by men whose loyalties were thoroughly Confederate. Upon registration of the name, a Connecticut judge, G. G. Bissell, objected to their choice and recorded it as Virginia City.

Within weeks Virginia City was a boomtown of thousands of prospectors and fortune seekers in the midst of a gold rush. The remote region of the Idaho Territory was without law enforcement or justice system, with the exception of miners&#x27; courts. In late 1863, the great wealth in the region, lack of a justice system and the insecure means of travel gave rise to serious criminal activity, especially robbery and murder along the trails and roads of the region. &quot;Road agents&quot;, as they became known, were ultimately responsible for up to 100 deaths in the region in 1863 and 1864. This resulted in the formation of the Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch and the infamous Montana Vigilantes. Up to 15 road agents were hanged by the vigilantes in December 1863 and January 1864, including the sheriff of Bannack and alleged leader of the road agent gang, Henry Plummer.

The Montana Territory was organized out of the existing Idaho Territory by Act of Congress and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on May 26, 1864. Although Bannack was the first territorial capital, the territorial legislature moved the capital to Virginia City on February 7, 1865. It remained the capital until April 19, 1875, when it moved to Helena. Thomas Dimsdale began publication of Montana&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Montana Post&quot;, in Virginia City on August 27, 1864. Montana&#x27;s first public school was established in Virginia City in March 1866.

===Preservation===
Virginia City&#x27;s population dwindled starting in the 1880s as the easily-extracted placer gold played out and miners moved away. Federal monetary policy in the 1930s reduced the gold content of the U.S. dollar, making gold relatively more valuable, which led to some gold mining revival across the west. However, in 1942, the National War Labor Board&#x27;s Limitation Order 209 made nearly all gold mining in the United States illegal, practically shuttering the gold mining industry in the United States. By the mid- to late-1940s, the town&#x27;s gold rush-era buildings were being abandoned or dismantled for their lumber. Charles and Sue Bovey began buying the town, putting much needed maintenance into failing structures. The ghost town of Virginia City began to be restored for tourism in the 1950s. The Boveys operated the town as an open-air museum complete with artifacts and living history enactments. Of the nearly 300 structures in town, almost half were built before 1900. Buildings in their original condition with Old West period displays and information plaques stand next to presently active restaurants, gift shops, and other businesses. The town received National Historic Landmark status in 1962, and many of its buildings have been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The National Park Service (NPS) considered adding the town to its system, conducting studies in 1937, 1980 and 1995. In the end, the state of Montana bought most of the historic buildings after the legislature authorized the purchase of the Bovey properties. Today, the Historic District of Virginia City and Nevada City is operated by the Montana Heritage Commission, with financial and technical assistance from the NPS. The commission operates gold panning, the Nevada City Music Hall and Museum, and the Alder Gulch Railroad.

Virginia City also has a Boot Hill cemetery, where the graves of Jack Gallagher, Boone Helm, &quot;Clubfoot&quot; George Lane, Hayes Lyons, and Frank Parrish—all road agents killed during Virginia City&#x27;s vigilante era—are placed in a location neighboring Virginia City&#x27;s main graveyard. The narrow-gauge Alder Gulch Short Line Railroad transports passengers by rail to the nearby ghost town of Nevada City and back.

The backdrop as well as the staged bar photos used in fine art pieces by David Yarrow are located in Virginia City at the Pioneer bar.

<text>Bonner-West Riverside (Salish: Nʔaycčstm, &quot;Place of the Big Bull Trout&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Missoula County, Montana, United States, including the unincorporated communities of Bonner, Milltown (formerly Riverside), West Riverside, and Pinegrove. It is part of the Missoula metropolitan area. The population was 1,690 at the 2020 census.

Bonner was named for Edward L. Bonner, president of the Missoula and Bitter Root Valley Railroad. Bonner was also a partner in Eddy, Hammond &amp; Company, who were contracted by the Northern Pacific Railroad for lumber to build their railway between the Thompson and Blackfoot rivers. Eddy, Hammond &amp; Company founded the Montana Improvement Company, which built a sawmill in Bonner in 1886.

Milltown is named for the mill. West Riverside is named for its position west of Milltown, formerly called &quot;Riverside&quot; for its position at the confluence of the Blackfoot and Clark Fork rivers. Pinegrove was named either for the Pine family that settled there or for the many large pines in the area. The associated Piltzville was named for Billy Piltz, early mill worker and yard boss.

== History ==
The area east of Missoula was born with the sawmill located there by Andrew B. Hammond. Hammond, with partners Richard Eddy and Edward Bonner, founders of the Montana Improvement Company (MIC), enticed the nearly complete Northern Pacific Railroad (NP) to pass through Missoula. They were rewarded with lucrative NP lumber contracts. Hammond, on behalf of the MIC, purchased land east of Missoula on Blackfoot River for a sawmill and dam to hold the mill&#x27;s supply of logs. The Blackfoot Milling Company began operation on 6 June 1886 and by August produced an average of 55,000 board feet of lumber per day. In addition to the NP contracts, the Blackfoot Mill (or Hammond Mill) provided stulls (mining shaft supports) and lumber for construction. It continued to expand and in 1889 it produced 24 million board feet of lumber and was considered the largest mill between Wisconsin and the West Coast. The sawmill was purchased by the Anaconda Company in 1898.

Bonner was the company town, encompassing the mill plus housing for mill managers and supervisors and a company store. By 1888, it included a post office, and in 1889 Bonner Hall, which housed the Masonic Lodge and the first school. In 1892, the elegant Margaret Hotel was built to house dignitaries. Later, a school, two churches, a library and community gardens were added. Only mill employees lived there. When the mill changed hands, Bonner with all its buildings was included. Bonner remained a possession of the mill until finally sold to private ownership in 2007.

Milltown, originally called &quot;Riverside&quot;, was organized a half mile downstream. John McCormick leased small lots of his &quot;farmland&quot; to mill workers and loggers who constructed small dwellings with materials &quot;borrowed&quot; from the mill. By 1892, Riverside already had a dozen homes, a livery stable, boarding house, and three saloons. In 1903, the anticipated construction of the new dam brought more workers who leased land. No one owned the land their homes were on until decades later.

In 1910, West Riverside was platted across the Blackfoot from Riverside, allowing for private land ownership. Population increased there with the establishment of the Western Lumber Company. Farming and more private homes became available to the east in Piltzville and to the west in Pine Grove.

&quot;On January 16, 1919, the &#x27;greatest fire in the history of Western Montana&#x27; burned a large portion of the mill to the ground.&quot; The mill was rebuilt and operational again by September 1919. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the Bonner Mill was thought to be the world&#x27;s largest of its type. The Anaconda Company sold the mill to US Plywood-Champion Papers in 1972. It was sold to Stimson Lumber Company in 1993 and was closed in 2008, after &quot;122 years of continuous lumber production&quot;. In 2011, a heavy snowfall collapsed much of the mill&#x27;s roof. The last PCBs were removed from the site in 2016.

Bonner Dam was built in 1884 (rebuilt in 1886) on the Blackfoot River to hold logs and provide a little energy to the mill. Milltown Dam (aka Clark&#x27;s Dam), finished in January 1908, was built just passed the confluence of the Blackfoot and Clark Fork rivers by Montana&#x27;s U.S Senator William A. Clark to supply hydroelectricity to local mills and the city of Missoula. The largest flood ever seen on those rivers occurred six months later, depositing millions of cubic yards of silt laden with heavy metals and arsenic in the Milltown Reservoir from upriver mining sites. As part of a Superfund cleanup site, Bonner Dam was removed in 2005 and Milltown Dam was removed in 2008. The Superfund restoration plan includes a redevelopment effort aimed at economic development and community revitalization.

==Geography==
Bonner-West Riverside is located in central Missoula County and is bordered to the west by the city of Missoula and to the southeast by unincorporated Piltzville. The Clark Fork River is the southwest border of the CDP, separating it from Missoula. The Blackfoot River flows through the CDP, separating Bonner and Milltown to the east from West Riverside and Pinegrove to the west, and joining the Clark Fork south of West Riverside.

Interstate 90 passes through the southern part of the community, with access from Exit 109. Montana Highway 200 and Montana Secondary Highway 210 (former U.S. Route 10) pass through the CDP, leading west to the center of Missoula. The two highways split in Milltown, with Highway 200 leading northeast to Great Falls and Highway 210 leading southeast through Piltztown to join Interstate 90 at Clinton. Butte, Montana, is southeast of Bonner-West Riverside via I-90.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 5.02%, are water.

==History==

Early settlers gave the location a generic name based on the ethnicity or language of the original settlers, namely French Canadians.

The settlement was cofounded around 1858 by two French Canadians moving inland with their Métis families to escape turmoil further west that followed the arrival of the American federal authorities. Jean-Baptiste Ducharme left Puget Sound during the Indian Wars (1855-1856) abandoning his land claim as his Muck Creek neighbors were arrested under martial law. Louis Brown (anglicized name) left the Colville Valley turmoil a few years later with his Pend d&#x27;Oreille wife and their daughters. Meanwhile the Kalispel Indian Community had moved upriver to a new locale accompanied by Jesuit priest Father Hoecken, who relocated the Saint-Ignatius mission northeast of the future Frenchtown.

The St. Louis Catholic Church was built in 1864.

A post office called Frenchtown was first established in 1868.

<doc id="123547" wikidata="Q960712" url="?curid=123547" title="Lolo, Montana">
<text>Lolo is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Missoula County, Montana, United States. It is part of the Missoula metropolitan area. The population was 4,399 at the 2020 census, an increase from its population of 3,892 in 2010. It is home to Travelers&#x27; Rest State Park, a site where Lewis and Clark camped in 1805 and again in 1806.

==History==
The Traveler&#x27;s Rest site, in Lolo, is one of the few sites in the nation with physical confirmation of the visit of Lewis and Clark.

There are several versions of the origin of the town name. One is a French pronunciation of the name Lawrence Rence, a fur trapper in the area. Another is the French name for Meriwether Lewis, &quot;Le Louis&quot;. Or it could be based on either a Chinook word or a Nez Perce word. In addition to the town, a national forest, creek, mountain peak, mountain pass, hot springs, and historic trail are all named Lolo.

The 2017 Lolo Peak Fire burned thousands of acres southwest of Lolo, prompting evacuations and closure of U.S. Route 12.

<text>Missoula ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Missoula County, Montana, United States. It is located along the Clark Fork River near its confluence with the Bitterroot and Blackfoot rivers in western Montana and at the convergence of five mountain ranges, and thus it is often described as the &quot;hub of five valleys&quot;. The 2020 United States census recorded the city&#x27;s population at 73,489 and the population of the Missoula Metropolitan Area at 117,922. As of 2023, the estimated city population was 77,757. Missoula is the second largest city and third largest metropolitan area in Montana. Missoula is home to the University of Montana, a public research university.

The Missoula area was settled by people of European descent from 1858, including William T. Hamilton, who set up a trading post along the Rattlesnake Creek; Captain Richard Grant, who settled near Grant Creek; and David Pattee, who settled near Pattee Canyon. Missoula was founded in 1860 as Hellgate Trading Post while still part of Washington Territory. By 1866, the settlement had moved east, upstream, and had been renamed &quot;Missoula Mills&quot;, later shortened to Missoula. The mills provided supplies to western settlers traveling along the Mullan Road. The establishment of Fort Missoula in 1877 to protect settlers further stabilized the economy. The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1883 brought rapid growth and the maturation of the local lumber industry. In 1893, the Montana Legislature chose Missoula as the site for the state&#x27;s first university. Along with the U.S. Forest Service headquarters founded in 1908, lumber and the university remained the basis of the local economy for the next 100 years.

By the 1990s, Missoula&#x27;s lumber industry had gradually disappeared, and , the city&#x27;s largest employers were the University of Montana, Missoula County Public Schools, and Missoula&#x27;s two hospitals. The city is governed by a mayor–council government with 12 city council members, two from each of the six wards. In and around Missoula are of parkland, of trails, and nearly of open-space conservation land, with adjacent Mount Jumbo being home to grazing elk and mule deer during the winter. The city is also home to both of Montana&#x27;s largest and its oldest active breweries, as well as the Montana Grizzlies. Notable residents include the first woman to serve in the U.S. Congress, Jeannette Rankin.

==History==
Archaeological artifacts date the earliest inhabitants of the Missoula Valley to , with settlements as early as . From the 1700s until the 1850s, those who used the land were primarily the Salish, Kootenai, Pend d&#x27;Oreille, Blackfeet, and Shoshone people. Located at the confluence of five mountain valleys, the Missoula Valley was heavily traversed by local and distant native tribes that periodically went to the Eastern Montana plains in search of bison. This led to conflicts. The narrow valley at Missoula&#x27;s eastern entrance was so strewn with human bones from repeated ambushes that French fur trappers later referred to this area as &quot;, translated as &quot;. would remain the name of the area until it was renamed &quot;Missoula&quot; in 1866.

The Lewis and Clark Expedition brought the first U.S. citizens to the area. They twice stopped just south of Missoula at Traveler&#x27;s Rest. They camped there the first time on their westbound trip in September 1805. When they stayed there again, on their return in June–July 1806, Clark left heading south along the Bitterroot River and Lewis traveled north, then east, through Hellgate Canyon. In 1860, Village was established west of present-day downtown by Christopher P. Higgins and Frank Worden as a trading post to serve travelers on the recently completed Mullan Road, the first wagon road to cross the Rocky Mountains to the inland of the Pacific Northwest. The desire for a more convenient water supply to power a lumber and flour mill led to the movement of the settlement to its modern location in 1864.

The Missoula Mills replaced Village as the economic power of the valley and replaced it as the county seat in 1866. The name &quot;Missoula&quot; came from the Salish name for the Clark Fork River, &quot;nmesuletkw&quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;place of frozen water&quot;. Fort Missoula was established in 1877 to help protect further arriving settlers. Growth accelerated with the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1883, and by charter, Missoula incorporated a municipal government as a town, the same year. In 1885, Missoula reincorporated its government as a city.

In 1893, Missoula was chosen as the location for the first state university, the University of Montana. The need for lumber for the railway and its bridges spurred the opening of multiple saw mills in the area, and in turn, the beginning of Missoula&#x27;s lumber industry, which remained the mainstay of the area economy for the next 100 years. The United States Forest Service work in Missoula began in 1905. Missoula is also home of the smokejumpers&#x27; headquarters and will be the site of the National Museum of Forest Service History. Nationally, there are nine Forest Service regions; Region1 is headquartered in Missoula.

Logging remained a mainstay of industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in &quot;Life&quot; 13 years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, almost 40% of the county labor income still came from the wood and paper-products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula&#x27;s economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance of many of the region&#x27;s log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the air dramatically.

In 1883, the Northern Pacific Railroad arrived in Missoula, spurring rapid growth in the town, which by then had about 500 residents.

In March 1970, the Northern Pacific, along with three other closely affiliated railroads (Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, Great Northern and Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle) merged to form Burlington Northern.

In 1987, BN decided to lease, for an initial term of 60 years, the ex-NP route to entrepreneur Dennis Washington, who formed Montana Rail Link. MRL established its headquarters in Missoula.

In January 2022, BNSF agreed to pay MRL $2 billion for an early lease termination. The return to BNSF control required the approval of the Surface Transportation Board, and this was later approved on March 8, 2023. BNSF took over operations on January 1, 2024. This absorbed the MRL into BNSF, integrating MRL operations, technology and personnel. All 1,200 employees were offered employment with BNSF.

, education and healthcare were Missoula&#x27;s leading industries; the University of Montana, Missoula County Public Schools, and the two hospitals in the city were the largest employers. St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center, founded in 1873, is the region&#x27;s only Level II trauma center and has undergone three major expansions since the 1980s. Likewise, the University of Montana grew 50% and built or renovated 20 buildings from 1990 to 2010. These industries, as well as expansions in business and professional services, and retail are expected to be the main engines of future growth.

==Geography==
Missoula is located at the western edge of Montana, less than from the Idaho border as the crow flies. By highway it is south of Kalispell, northwest of Butte and southeast of Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho. The city is at an elevation of above sea level, with nearby Mount Sentinel and Mount Jumbo steeply rising to and , respectively. According to the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s figures, the city had a total area of , of which were land and , or 0.54%, were covered by water.
Around 13,000 years ago, the entire valley was at the bottom of Glacial Lake Missoula. As could be expected for a former lake bottom, the layout of Missoula is relatively flat and surrounded by steep hills. Evidence of the city of Missoula&#x27;s lake-bottom past can be seen in the form of ancient horizontal wave-cut shorelines on nearby Mount Sentinel and Mount Jumbo. At the location of present-day University of Montana, the lake once had a depth of . The Clark Fork River enters the Missoula Valley from the east through Hellgate Canyon after joining the Blackfoot River east of downtown, at the site of the former Milltown Dam. The Bitterroot River and multiple smaller tributaries join the Clark Fork on the western edge of Missoula. The city also sits at the convergence of five mountain ranges: the Bitterroot Mountains, Sapphire Range, Garnet Range, Rattlesnake Mountains, and the Reservation Divide, and thus is often described as being the &quot;hub of five valleys&quot;.

Soils in Missoula are mostly of silty clay loam or loam texture. Some of the loams which developed on stream terraces and alluvial fans are very gravelly (Bigarm Series). Soil drainage is somewhat excessive where gravel content is high, and the less gravelly soils are well drained. Topsoils usually have neutral pH while subsoils may be rich in calcium carbonate and therefore alkaline.

===Flora and fauna===
Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has a typical Rocky Mountain ecology. Local wildlife includes populations of white-tailed deer, moose, grizzly bears, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo due to its steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows, and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.

Native riparian plant life includes sandbar willows and cottonwoods, with Montana&#x27;s state tree, the ponderosa pine, also being prevalent. Other native plants include wetland species such as cattails and beaked sedge, as well as shrubs and berry plants such as Douglas hawthorn, chokecherry, and western snowberries. To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula is also home to several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, leafy spurge, St. John&#x27;s wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula&#x27;s older streets have also been declared an invasive species.

===Climate===
Missoula has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), with cold and moderately snowy winters, hot and dry summers, and short, crisp springs and autumns. Winters are usually milder than much of the rest of the state due to Missoula&#x27;s location west of the Rockies, allowing it to receive mild, moist Pacific air and avoid the worst of cold snaps; however, it also gets more precipitation in winter. Winter snowfall averages , typically occurring between October 30 and April 20, with an annual average of 120 days of snow on the ground. As with the rest of the state, summers are very sunny, and the average diurnal temperature variation is more than from late June through late September, due to the relative aridity. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in December to in July. On average, annually, there are 24 days with temperatures at or above , 45 days where the temperature does not rise above freezing, and 7.8 days with temperatures reaching at or below . Record temperatures range from on January 26, 1957, up to , most recently on June 30, 2021; the record cold maximum is , last recorded on February 2, 1989, while, conversely, the record warm minimum is on July 27, 1939.

The median income for a household in the city was $30,366, and for a family was $42,103. Males had a median income of $30,686 versus $21,559 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,166. About 11.7% of families and 19.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.5% of those under age 18 and 9.3% of those age 65 or over. About 40.3% of Missoula residents age 25 and older have a bachelor&#x27;s or advanced college degree.
===2010 census===
&#x27;s census, 66,788 people, 29,081 households, and 13,990 families resided in the city. The population density was . The 30,682 housing units averaged . The racial makeup of the city was 92.1% White, 0.5% African American, 2.8% Native American, 1.2% Asian, 0.6% from other races, and 2.8% from two or more races.

The median age in the city was 30.9 years. The gender makeup of the city was 49.9% male and 50.1% female.

==Economy==
Missoula began as a trading post in the 1860s situated along the Mullan Military Road to take advantage of the first route across the Bitterroot Mountains to the plains of Eastern Washington. Its designation as county seat in 1866 and location of the hastily built Fort Missoula in 1877 ensured Missoula&#x27;s status as a regional commercial center, a status further consolidated in 1883 with the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway. The railroad expanded Missoula&#x27;s trade area to cover a 150-mile radius, and Missoula&#x27;s location as the railway&#x27;s division point and repair shops provided hundreds of jobs. When the railway began expanding again in 1898, increased freight shipments came through the city, and with the arrival of the Milwaukee Road and regional office for the U.S. Forest Service, as well as the opening of the Flathead Indian Reservation to settlement all within a couple years of each other beginning in 1908, the economy began to expand rapidly.

Lumber mills were originally built to provide construction-grade materials for homes and businesses, but then expanded to entice and then meet the demands of the railroad; they profited from an increase in demand from railroad expansion and the nation at large. The Bonner mill, owned the Northern Pacific and Copper King Marcus Daly, became the largest producer of lumber in the northwest. In 1908, Missoula&#x27;s location as both a major lumber producer and a regional commercial center helped land the city the regional office for the newly establish U.S. Forest Service, created to help manage the nation&#x27;s timber supply. Over the next century, Missoula&#x27;s various lumber industries was consolidated under various entities such as the Anaconda Company in the 1970s and Champion International Paper through the 1980s until most were under control of Plum Creek Timber, all the while demand in timber dropped. In 2007, a downward spiral of Missoula&#x27;s lumber industry began with the closure of a plywood plant in Bonner, the closure of Bonner&#x27;s sawmill in 2008, and the closing of the Smurfit-Stone Container pulp mill in 2010.

Since opening in 1895, the University of Montana has had a major impact on the development of Missoula&#x27;s economy. In addition to the economic advantage from accommodating the student body, it gave the city an educated workforce not available in most of the state. The university has a close relationship with the city as Missoula&#x27;s largest employer and with the millions of dollars the school brings into the city through visitors of school-sponsored sporting and cultural events. The university also houses Missoula&#x27;s only business incubator, the Montana Technology Enterprise Center, and several start-up businesses.

Missoula is the hub of its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) economic area, which includes the Montana counties of Flathead, Lake, Lincoln, Mineral, Missoula, Ravalli, and Sanders. , the BEA listed the economic area population at 306,050. Key businesses sectors serving the area include health care, retail shopping, transportation, financial services, government and social services, education, events, arts and culture. Health care in particular is one of Missoula&#x27;s fastest growing industries with St. Patrick Hospital (western Montana&#x27;s only level-II trauma center) and the Community Medical Center, already the city&#x27;s second- and third-largest employers behind the university. About 55% of employment in Missoula is made up of the service and retail sectors. Export industries are concentrated in heavy and civil engineering, construction, beverage production, technical services, truck transportation, and forestry-, logging-, and wood-related industries. In addition to nearly 4million out-of-state visitors annually, which makes tourism a significant aspect of the Missoula economy, Missoula also is home to a vibrant sector of alternative healthcare.

, Missoula ranked 299 nationally in gross metropolitan product with an output of $5billion, the city&#x27;s total personal income ranked 333 at $4.18billion, an increase of more than 47% since 2003. , per capita personal income ranked 239 at $37,397 a year, 84% of the national average. The Missoula metropolitan area&#x27;s unemployment rate was 3.7% , dropping nearly 0.8% in the twelve months prior.

===Top Employers===
As of the city&#x27;s 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, Missoula&#x27;s top employers are:

==Culture==

Missoula, often considered the cultural center of Montana, is the location of the state&#x27;s first university, and an eclectic mix of loggers, hippies, college students, sports fans, and retirees. Community events generally take place downtown either outdoors or in one of the several downtown buildings listed on the National Historic Registry.

Since 2006, the River City Roots Festival has been an event each August with music, beer, food, and art, and generally attracts crowds of 15,000. The longest-standing event downtown has been the Missoula Farmers Market that was founded in 1972, which provides an outlet for Western Montana produce on Saturday mornings from May to October as well as Tuesday evenings from July to early September. An arts and crafts People&#x27;s Market and a Clark Fork Market run concurrently. Downtown hosts &quot;First Friday Missoula&quot;, a gallery walk on the first Friday of the month to feature local art from museums and galleries, such as that of Monte Dolack. Missoula celebrates &quot;First Night Missoula&quot; on New Year&#x27;s Eve, which includes food and live entertainment. The &quot;Festival of the Book&quot; to celebrate the literature of the American West was rebranded the &quot;Montana Book Festival&quot; in 2015. Missoula&#x27;s two historic theatres both hold annual film festivals: the Roxy hosting the International Wildlife Film Festival, established in 1977 as the first juried wildlife film festival in the world; and since 2003, the Wilma accommodating the largest film event in Montana, the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival.

In performance arts, the Missoula Community Theatre has held performances of musical and nonmusical plays since 1977, with its affiliated Missoula Children&#x27;s Theatre also acting as an international touring program that visits nearly 1,000 communities per year around the world. Missoula is also home to a number of modern dance companies, including Bare Bait Dance and Headwaters Dance Company. Rocky Mountain Ballet Theatre and Garden City Ballet are also based in Missoula.

The Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture, which became a state museum in 2001, is one Montana&#x27;s oldest cultural reserves, having begun in 1894; its permanent collection houses more than 10,000 original works. The Missoula Museum of Art is housed in a former Carnegie library; it features contemporary art and annually features 20–25 group and solo exhibits. Fort Missoula is home to the Historic Museum, dedicated to preserving the history of Western Montana, and to the Rocky Mountain Museum of Military History and the Northern Rockies Heritage Center. The National Museum of Forest Service History is constructing the National Conservation Legacy and Education Center in Missoula, too.
Opened in 1987, Missoula&#x27;s Bayern Brewing is the oldest active brewery in Montana. Big Sky Brewing opened in 1995 and with a production over 38,000 barrels , it is by far Montana&#x27;s largest brewery, and produces the best-selling beer brewed in Montana, Moose Drool Brown Ale. Missoula has also been home to Kettle House Brewing since 1995 and Draught Works opened in 2011. Big Sky, Bayern, and Kettlehouse represent the first-, second-, and third-largest breweries, respectively, in Montana. Also in 2011, Tamarack Brewing and Flathead Lake Brewing Company from nearby Lake County opened pub houses at downtown Missoula locations. The city also holds annually the Garden City Brewfest and Winterfest, and periodically hosts the Montana Brewers Festival.

The Clay Studio of Missoula is a non-profit ceramic-arts center, which provides education and a community access clay studio.

==Sports==
Missoula plays host to a variety of intercollegiate, youth, and amateur sports organizations in addition to a minor league baseball team. The Montana Grizzlies&#x27; football and basketball teams of the University of Montana have the highest attendance. The Montana Grizzlies football team has a successful program within the NCAA D-1 FCS level. Their home games at Washington–Grizzly Stadium have a near 90% winning percentage and average over 25,000 spectators in attendance. All games are televised throughout Montana. The Grizzlies men&#x27;s and Lady Griz basketball teams have also been successful at the conference level, where they both rank at or near the top in attendance, about 4,000 and 3,000, respectively, and play their home games at Dahlberg Arena.

Missoula is home to the Missoula PaddleHeads who play in the Rocky Mountain-based Pioneer Baseball League. They play their home games at Ogren Park at Allegiance Field.

Since 1977, Missoula has also held &quot;Maggotfest&quot;, a festival-style rugby tournament hosted by the Missoula Maggots Rugby Club the first weekend in May. The non-elimination tournament focuses on the fun aspect of the game, attracting 36 teams (male and female) from around the United States and Canada. In regular-season play, the Missoula Maggots compete as part of the Montana Rugby Union alongside another local rugby team, the University of Montana Jesters.

The Thomas Meagher Hurling Club are also based in Missoula and play in the Northwestern division of the USGAA. The club are named after the late Irish nationalist and former acting Territorial Governor of Montana, Thomas Francis Meagher.

==Parks and recreation==
The city has over of parkland, of trails, and nearly of conserved open space. Located at the confluence of three rivers (the Clark Fork, Bitterroot, and Blackfoot), the area is also popular for white water rafting and, thanks largely to the novel and subsequent film &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; by Missoula native Norman Maclean, is well known for its fly fishing. Additionally, Missoula has two aquatic parks, multiple golf courses, is home to the Adventure Cycling Association, and hosts what &quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; called the &quot;best overall&quot; marathon in the U.S. There are also three ski areas within : Montana Snowbowl, Discovery Ski Area, and Lost Trail Powder Mountain. Slightly farther away are Lookout Pass, Blacktail Mountain, and Big Mountain.

A system of public parks was developed in Missoula in 1902 with the donation by lumber baron Thomas Greenough and his wife Tessie. They gave a tract of land along Rattlesnake Creek for Greenough Park, on the condition that &quot;the land forever be used as a park and for park purposes to which the people of Missoula may ... find a comfortable, romantic and poetic retreat&quot;. In a follow-up nine years later in a letter to the &quot;Missoulian&quot;, he stressed his interest in having the park remain in as close to a native state as possible. That request, along with the discovery that non-native Norway maples were inhibiting the growth of native trees and shrubs such as cottonwoods, ponderosa pines, and Rocky Mountain maples, led to the controversial decision to remove Norway maples from the park with the hope of returning it to its natural state.

In 1924, Bonner Park was created out of John L. Bonner&#x27;s estate near the university. Today&#x27;s park has multiple athletic fields and courts, and band shell used by the Missoula City band through the summer. The Kiwanis club set up a Kiwanis Park downtown in 1934, making it the first of a string of parks that line both sides of the Clark Fork River. One of those parks on the southern bank of the river is McCormick Park, which was created with WPA funds out of surplus highway land, a parcel from the American Hide and Fur Company, and land donated from the Kate McCormick estate. The park, named for Washington J. McCormick and his wife, is home to a skate park, aquatics center, a free bike check-out, and a children&#x27;s fishing pond. Other popular parks include the Jacobs Island Bark Park, a designated area for dogs to play off-leash; the Montana State veterans&#x27; memorial rose garden; Waterwise Garden, a &quot;living laboratory&quot; garden utilizing water conservation techniques; and Splash Montana Waterpark at Playfair Park.

===Caras Park===
Caras Park is located just south of the historic Wilma Theatre downtown. It is located on land reclaimed when the Higgins Avenue Bridge was widened from two lanes to four in 1962. Before the reclamation, the Clark Fork River divided to create an island with the north channel&#x27;s bank extending to nearby buildings such as the Wilma Theatre. The south channel was deepened for the increased water flow and the infilled land later became Caras Park. Events in the park were not common until the early 1980s and permanent fixtures such as &quot;Out to Lunch&quot;, which began in 1986. The Missoula Downtown Association took over from Parks and Recreation to manage the park and made improvements to make Caras Park more event-friendly. Seating, event circles, brick plazas, restrooms, and storage structures were added. Large temporary tents were used for events until 1997, when a permanent pavilion was constructed. The park is a hub of city festivities including include &quot;Out to Lunch&quot;, the International Wildlife Film Festival, First Night Missoula, Garden City BrewFest and offered intimate concert settings for artists such as Jewel, Chris Isaak, Santana, Ziggy Marley, and B.B. King. Located next to Caras Park is A Carousel for Missoula, a wooden, hand-carved and volunteer-built carousel; and Dragon Hollow, a children&#x27;s recreational area adjacent to the carousel.

==Government and politics==

Missoula&#x27;s system of government has changed four times since 1883, when an aldermanic form of government was approved with the town charter. The city adopted a commission-council form of government in 1911 with the opening of new City Hall and a council–manager government in 1954 before returning to an aldermanic form of government in 1959. Since January 1, 1997, Missoula has been governed in accordance with the Missoula City Charter, which calls for a mayor–council system of government.

The current system comprises a mayor and city treasurer elected in a citywide vote and 12 city council members who must reside in and are elected from one of six wards, with each ward having two council members. All positions are nominally nonpartisan. Council members and the mayor are elected to four-year terms with council-member elections being staggered to allow only one member from each ward to up for re-election. No term limits exist for either position.

Missoula&#x27;s state legislative delegation is the second-largest in the Montana Legislature and is represented by districts 91–100 in the Montana House of Representatives and districts 46–50 in the Montana Senate. It has 14 Democrats and only one Republican in its state legislative delegation

Missoula is often considered the most liberal city in Montana. Though its political leanings may not be unique for a college town, its initiative to make marijuana possession the lowest priority of and symbolic resolutions calling on Congress to withdraw from and to amend the U.S. Constitution to declare that &quot;corporations are often put it at odds with the rest of the state. In 2011, the Montana legislature, with a Republican House majority, attempted to overturn Missoula&#x27;s marijuana law and revoke its ability to have an anti-discrimination ordinance that included the LGBT community. The marijuana repeal was vetoed by then-Governor Brian Schweitzer and the attempt to repeal the anti-discrimination ordinance died in the State Senate.

In 2020, Missoula County became the first county in Montana to adopt a county sales tax on gasoline (an option afforded to counties in Montana that had gone unused for several decades). The Montana Legislature and Governor Greg Gianforte blocked this decision the following year, repealing the sales tax provision from state law.

==Education==
Missoula&#x27;s first school was opened in late 1869 with 16 students from around the region and their teacher Emma C. Slack, who had come to Missoula by a two-month trip by horseback, railroad, and boat from Baltimore at the invitation of her brother. She resigned two years later upon marrying (the first couple married in Missoula) and was replaced by Elizabeth Countryman, who later married Missoula&#x27;s first mayor, The first public high school was opened in 1904, but was converted back to a grade school after the Missoula County High School (now Hellgate High School) was opened in 1908. After several expansions, Stanford University was commissioned in 1951 to create a master building plan to manage future growth. It suggested purchasing land and building an additional campus at the Garden City Airport&#x27;s Hale Field, which was gradually being replaced by the Missoula County Airport, which was then southwest of town. The new school (now Sentinel High School) was opened in 1957. Initially, the two campuses were separated between upper and lower classmen with upper classmen in the new school, but in 1965, the two campuses became separate high schools. In 1974, the private Loyola Sacred Heart Catholic High School was created from a merger of the all-girls Sacred Heart Academy (.1873) and the all-boys Loyola High School (.1912). In 1980, Missoula&#x27;s third public high school, Big Sky, was established.

Missoula County Public Schools has two components: Missoula Elementary School District and Missoula High School District. The city of Missoula is divided between the following elementary school districts: Most of Missoula is in Missoula Elementary School District while other portions are in Hellgate Elementary School District, DeSmet Elementary School District, Target Range Elementary School District, and Bonner Elementary School District. All residents are in the Missoula High School District. The school district numbers of the districts are In Missoula, there are nine public elementary schools (kindergarten to 5th grade), three public middle schools (6th to 8th grades), four public high schools (9th to 12th grades), and three public schools serving kindergarten to 8th grade. Missoula also has several private schools including an international school, religious-affiliated schools, as well as Next Step Prep, a theater academy high school operated by the Missoula Children&#x27;s Theatre.

The University of Montana dominates higher education in Missoula. The university, established in 1893, was Montana&#x27;s first, and has the state&#x27;s second-largest enrollment, with 12,922 students . The campus houses six colleges and three schools including Montana&#x27;s first and only law school, the Alexander Blewett III School of Law. The university is also the location of the state&#x27;s Regional Federal Depository Library, and houses the state Arboretum. The University of Montana College of Technology, established in 1956 and formerly known as the Missoula Vocational Technical Center, offers fast-track learning programs. Multiple vocational programs not affiliated with the university ranging from photography and massage to truck driving also have a presence in Missoula.

Missoula has a public library, the Missoula Public Library.

==Media==
===Broadcast===
Missoula&#x27;s single–broadcast over–air television media market is the largest in Montana and ranked 165 nationally . Though Missoula itself is second in population to Billings, Montana, Missoula&#x27;s single-broadcast over-air television media market includes all of Missoula, Ravalli, Granite, Mineral, Lake, Flathead, and Sanders Counties in the more densely populated western region of Montana and serves over 112,600 television homes . Missoula is home to three local affiliate channels: KPAX-TV (CBS/MTN, ; founded 1970; ), KECI-TV (NBC; founded 1954 as KGVO-TV; ), and KTMF-TV (ABC, FOX; founded 1991; ). Also based in Missoula at the University of Montana is (founded 1984; ).

===Print and online===
Missoula has three main sources of print and digital media: the &quot;Missoulian&quot; (daily), The &quot;Missoula Current&quot; (daily), and &quot;Montana Kaimin&quot; (college). The &quot;Missoulian&quot; was founded as a weekly publication in 1870 as &quot;The Missoula and Cedar Creek Pioneer&quot; and remains the city&#x27;s oldest news product. The &quot;Missoula Current&quot; was founded in 2015 and provides local and regional coverage and is the state&#x27;s largest digital-only news product. The &quot;MontanaKaimin&quot; (founded 1891) is distributed for free throughout parts of Missoula with heavy student traffic from the University of Montana, where the newspaper is printed weekly every Thursday during the school year.

==Infrastructure==
===Health care===
Missoula has two primary health care facilities: St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center and Community Medical Center. St. Patrick&#x27;s was founded in 1873 under the sponsorship of the Sisters of Providence. It is the only Level II trauma center in western Montana and has undergone three major expansions since the 1980s. The hospital has 195 acute-care beds and admitted over 9,700 patients in 2003. The name was changed from &quot;St. Patrick Hospital&quot; to &quot;St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center&quot; in 2000 to reflect an increasing involvement with national medical research and education. The Community Medical Center and its adjacent medical facilities are located near Fort Missoula and is part of a modern complex that includes a nursing home, the Missoula Crippled Children&#x27;s Center, and private offices. It was founded in 1922 as Thornton Hospital by doctors Will Thornton and Charles Thornton and has been at its current location since 1972. Although originally a locally owned, nonprofit hospital, it is now owned by a large corporation headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, and is a for-profit entity. It is the only hospital in Western Montana with a separate Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. The center is partnered with Seattle Children&#x27;s Hospital. The nearest Level I trauma center to Missoula is Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.

===Utilities===

The earliest Missoulians drew their water directly from the Clark Fork River or nearby Rattlesnake Creek. The first water system consisted of a Native American known as One-Eyed Riley and his friend filling buckets of water from the Rattlesnake Creek and hauling them door to door on a donkey cart. In 1871 city co-founder Frank Worden began construction of a long pipe and wooden main system that flowed from the Rattlesnake Creek north of the city. With the addition of two small covered reservoirs, the first municipal water system was begun in 1880. With an intake dam built-in 1901 with a settling basin capacity of , the Rattlesnake Creek continued to meet the demands of the city until 1935 when five wells were added to respond to increased summer and fall demand. This system is still maintained as an emergency backup but was discontinued as a primary source after Giardia outbreak in 1983. Since then, Missoula has relied on the Missoula Valley Aquifer as the sole source of water. In 1889, the first electrical plant was built by to power his major downtown properties such as the Missoula Mercantile and the Florence Hotel. In 1905, the Missoula Mercantile (by then owned by Copper King William A. Clark purchased the water system and consolidated it with its vast electrical holdings to create the Missoula Light and Water Company (ML&amp;W) a year later. Electricity and water remained bundled after ML&amp;W&#x27;s sale to the Montana Power Company (MPC) in 1929. In 1979, MPC sold its water utility holdings as Mountain Water Company to Park Water Company in Downey, California, which since 2011 has been a subsidiary of The Carlyle Group. In 2015, the City of Missoula was legally granted its right to acquire″ the water system by exercising its power of eminent domain&quot;, but the decision was upheld by a district court.

Following the deregulation of Montana&#x27;s electricity market in 1997, Montana Power Company began to divest its energy business. MPC sold substantially all its electrical generating assets to the PPL Corporation in December 1997 and its energy transmission and distribution business to NorthWestern Corporation in February 2002. Despite filing for bankruptcy in 2002, NorthWestern Corporation&#x27;s subsidiary NorthWestern Energy is the primary provider of electric and natural gas service to Missoula in addition to the Rural Utilities Service&#x27;s Missoula Electric Cooperative.

Local telephone service in the area is provided by CenturyLink and Blackfoot Telecommunications. Major cell phone providers include AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Allied Waste handles recycling through a program where customers can purchase special blue bags to designate recyclables. Recycling has also been offered by Missoula Valley Recycling since 1992, by Garden City Recycling since 2010 which offers curbside pickup, and by Pacific Steel &amp; Recycling which offers drop-off recycling. Sewer service is handled by the City of Missoula Wastewater Division.

===City layout and development===

In the mid-1860s, and Frank Worden began plotting what would become the town of Missoula along the Mullan Military Road, which ran parallel to the Clark Fork River. Through downtown Missoula, the route of the road is now Front Street. It is intersected by Higgins Avenue, to which a bridge across the Clark Fork was added in 1873. The intersection of these two streets became the default center of the city, and remains the numerical center regarding city street addresses. The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1883 led to a housing boom along the tracks, particularly on the northern side where many of the railway workers would reside. When the Higgins Avenue Bridge was replaced in 1893, they debated whether the bridge should continue southwest toward the Bitterroot Valley as it had earlier or due south. Attorneys and had already laid out plots of land five years earlier for what they hoped would be a new town of &quot;South Missoula&quot;. The streets there were perpendicular to the Bitterroot Wagon Road. In contrast, Judge Hiram Knowles who owned the land just south of the river preferred the north–south plan and did not want to become part of South Missoula. The result was a along the west side of Higgins Avenue commonly referred to as the &quot;Slant Streets&quot; centered along what is now Stephens Avenue. Stephens Avenue and Brooks Street are the only arterials to traverse the city diagonally along with the Bitterroot Branch of Montana Rail Link. With the exception of Downtown, the rest of the city, where streets follow the angle of the river, and newer expansions into the hills, strictly follow the grid plan. With the establishment of the University of Montana in 1893 and the announcement that the tracks of the Milwaukee Road would be located south of the river, houses began to spread quickly throughout the university and south side districts. The area near the university was promoted as high-end and luxurious homes appeared on Hammond Avenue (then nicknamed &quot;Millionaires Row&quot; and known today as Gerald Avenue).

The arrival of Interstate90 in the mid-1960s forced the removal of 60 homes, including the Greenough Mansion. The north side of Missoula became isolated between the Interstate and the tracks while the Greenough Mansion was moved to a South Hills golf course and converted to a restaurant. This dichotomy has prevailed with the North Side feeling neglected by the city while the South Hills became an upscale neighborhood. The Missoula Downtown Master Plan of 2009 emphasized redevelopment of the North Side&#x27;s former rail yard and the area just south of the tracks.

The city is divided into 18 neighborhood councils, of which all Missoula residents are members. The city further contains 10 historical districts: Downtown Missoula, East Pine Street, Fort Missoula, Lower Rattlesnake, McCormick, Northside, Southside, University Area and, the campus of the University of Montana.

====Trail system====
Missoula has an extensive trail system for both commuting and recreation that extends over . The city is actively trying to connect its various sections within the city to each other and to recreational trails extending beyond the city. The heart of the Missoula Commuter Bike Network is the trails along either side of the Clark Fork River that link Downtown with surrounding neighborhoods, the university, city parks, and outlying open space with smooth surfaces and three bicycle/pedestrian bridges. The most southern of these is Milwaukee Trail, which follows the former Milwaukee Railroad and continues east out of town as the Kim Williams Nature Trail beside Mount Sentinel. The Bitterroot Branch Trail connects to the Riverfront trails west of Downtown and, when completed, will provide a trail from Downtown to Southgate Mall. Near the Bitterroot Branch Trail, but not connected, is the South Avenue Trail on the west side of Reserve Street that connects the Community Medical Center with Fort Missoula, nearby athletic fields, and the Bitterroot River. The South Hills neighborhood has its own system of trails that is also approaching, but not quite meeting, the larger network.

===Transportation===
====Highways====
 runs east–west along the northern edge of Missoula at the base of the North Hills, with all but a small portion of the city located south of the highway. Completed in 1965 at the expense of 60 homes, the Garden City Brewery, and the Greenough Mansion, I‑90 has four city exits and makes connections with , and Montana Highway 200. The original , approved by the AASHO in 1939 to extend west into Montana, did not include Missoula until the highway was rerouted along State Route6 in October 1959 and was not extended west from Missoula until 1962. The road now crosses Missoula southwest–northeast. serves as a major economic corridor for western Montana, connecting Missoula with the Bitterroot Valley communities to the south and Flathead Lake, Kalispell, and Glacier National Park to the north. , the longest state highway in the United States, enters Missoula from the east and provides access along the Blackfoot River and a direct route to Great Falls.

====Transit====
Public transportation in Missoula began as early as 1890 with a horse-drawn streetcar system (electrified in 1910) operated by the Missoula Street Railway Company that connected Downtown Missoula with the university, Bonner, the fairgrounds, and Fort Missoula. These streetcars were then replaced by buses in 1932 due to cost. Bus service today is provided by Mountain Line, a public transit agency created by public vote in 1976 as part of the Missoula Urban Transportation District (MUTD) that began operation in December 1977. Mountain Line operates 14 bus routes within a area, serving Missoula, East Missoula, Bonner, Target Range, Rattlesnake, and the airport. Additionally the line has offered paratransit services since 1991 to assist the disabled, senior van since 2008, and has four park‑and‑ride lots throughout Missoula. Special bus service is offered to the University of Montana through three of the city&#x27;s park‑and‑ride lots in addition to a late-night UDASH shuttle that offers service between the university and Downtown. a three-year pilot program of zero-fare transportation on all Mountain Line buses began, with the goal of increasing ridership by 45 percent.

====Bus lines====
Direct intercity ground travel needs are provided by bus carrier Jefferson Lines.

====Railroads====
Intercity rail travel was available from 1883, when the Northern Pacific Railway began service through Missoula, until 1979 when Amtrak discontinued its &quot;North Coast Hiawatha&quot; route across southern Montana. In 1901, the Northern Pacific built their station at the terminus of Higgins Avenue; since 1985, it has been on the National Register of Historic Places. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad built their &quot;Pacific Extension&quot; through Missoula, and that station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

A feasibility study was commissioned by Congress in 2008 to examine the merits of reopening the &quot;North Coast Hiawatha&quot;, but , the nearest rail station to Missoula is the Whitefish station of Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot;, to the north.

====Bicycles====
In 2009, the Missoula metropolitan statistical area (MSA) ranked as the fifth highest in the United States for percentage of commuters who biked to work (5 percent). In 2013, the Missoula MSA ranked as the tenth lowest in the United States for percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (77.2 percent). In the same year, 8.5 percent of Missoula area commuters walked to work.

====Airport====

In 1927, air travel to Missoula began; today the city is served by Missoula Montana Airport, a public airport run by the Missoula County Airport Authority. It is the largest airport in western Montana, serving 913,198 passengers in 2023. The current building contains three jet bridges and three ground‑level boarding gates.

==Notable people==

Missoula has produced and been home to a number of notable individuals in varying fields. Its natives and residents are referred to as &quot;Missoulians&quot;. In politics, Jeannette Rankin, the first woman in Congress, was born and raised in Missoula while Senators Mike Mansfield, the U.S.&#x27;s longest serving Senate Majority Leader, and Max Baucus, Montana&#x27;s longest serving U.S. Senator both established careers and joined politics while living in the city.

Noted athletes who were born or resided in Missoula include five Olympic medalists, Pro Football Hall of Fame Quarterback John Elway, and former Milwaukee Bucks coach Larry Krystkowiak.

Joanna Klink, poet and professor at the University of Montana. Michael Punke, the author of the best-selling novel &quot;The Revenant&quot;, also lives in Missoula.

==Sister cities==

* Neckargemünd, Baden-Württemberg, Germany
* Palmerston North, New Zealand
Missoula&#x27;s Sister City relationship with Palmerston North, New Zealand, began after Missoula resident and later University of Montana professor Harold Bockemuehl returned from obtaining his PhD from Massey University. The relationship was made official in 1983 after a meeting between then UM President Neil Bucklew and officials from Massey University. Each May, Missoula celebrates &quot;New Zealand Day&quot; in honor of the relationship with rugby, food, and entertainment. Missoula&#x27;s second Sister City relationship began in 1991 after a Neckargemünd delegation, led by Mayor Oskar Schuster, visited Missoula following a Fulbright-sponsored faculty exchange between Heidelberg University and the University of Montana. Every September the Missoula Cultural Council holds an annual &quot;Germanfest&quot; to celebrate German culture and this relationship.

==Portrayal in media==
Author Norman Maclean grew up in Missoula and wrote about it in his 1976 autobiographical novella &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;. The work was adapted into a 1992 motion picture of the same name, directed by Robert Redford and starring Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer.

&quot;&quot;, a 2015 book by Jon Krakauer, focused on a series of sexual assault cases between 2010 and 2012 and the way that the Missoula Police Department, the Missoula County Attorney&#x27;s Office, and the University of Montana handled those cases. Missoula&#x27;s handling of rape cases sparked a Justice Department&#x27;s investigation that found a &quot;pattern of disrespect and indifference toward alleged victims&quot; by Missoula law enforcement, prosecutors, and the university, with scathing blame directed at the Attorney&#x27;s Office. While being interviewed on NPR about the book, Krakauer stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t mean to single out Missoula: Its rape rate is a little less than the national average; I think its problems with dealing with rape are pretty depressingly typical.&quot; Nevertheless, reporting by Krakauer and local and national journalists showed what they characterized as a troubling pattern of authorities mishandling investigations, treating victims with hostility and suspicion, reflexively protecting alleged perpetrators at the expense of victims, declining to prosecute large numbers of credible rape allegations, and creating an atmosphere where victims were unlikely to come forward after an attack. Krakauer placed a significant portion of the blame for the mishandling of rape prosecutions on a single Deputy County Attorney, Kirsten Pabst, who now serves as the Missoula County Attorney. The book also charted deep divisions within the town about the allegations, particularly those involving football players from the Montana Grizzlies.

There is a lengthy study of Missoula in the title essay of British writer Jonathan Raban&#x27;s &quot;Driving Home: An American Journey&quot;: despite writing that on his arrival, &quot;I had the powerful impression that I had driven deep into the Rocky Mountains and somehow arrived in Rotherham or Barnsley,&quot; and that &quot;the overall effect was oddly unsettling; the streets too open for comfort, the town too closed in, inducing mild claustrophobia and agoraphobia at the same time&quot;, he notes the literary heritage of the city and its reputation as a &quot;kindly town&quot; (evidenced by its being a place where &quot;odds and ends naturally collected and cohered&quot;).

Missoula is mentioned as being the closest city to the fictional Hope County in &quot;Far Cry 5&quot;. The game&#x27;s second mission involves the player trying to escape the county to reach Missoula.

The Harkema Industrial Park in &quot;Project Wingman&quot;, a complex of ocean platforms, is constructed over a post-Calamity submerged Missoula.

<text>Clyde Park is a town in Park County, Montana, United States. The population was 332 at the 2020 census. Originally known as Sunnyside, the town was renamed in the 1890s.

== History ==

Founded in the 1870s, the present-day site of Clyde Park was founded as Sunnyside by Texas cattlemen who were attracted to the area for grazing their herds. The post office in Sunnyside was established in 1887. In 1887, a post office called Clyde Park was established at the historic Harvey and Tregloan Ranch, where John Harvey owned a Clydesdale horse which he had imported from England in the late 1890s. A stagecoach from Livingston, Montana, reached the town in the 1880s.

In 1901, the Clyde Park post office was merged with Sunnyside, and the town was renamed Clyde Park. However, the reason is unclear. Another source suggests that the town was called Clyde Park in honor of Clyde Durand, a local rancher; or for Harvey&#x27;s Clydesdale horse. The Harvey and Tregloan Ranch eventually was sold to Robert Shiplet. The present-day Shiplet Ranch has historic barns that date to the 1870s or 80s, and its livestock brand is notably the shape of Montana.

In 1909 the Northern Pacific Railway established a branch line to the town, and in 1912 it incorporated as Clyde Park. That year it was reported to have a bank, a newspaper, a creamery, and an elevator. A major fire burned much of the town in 1919.

Today, Clyde Park is the home of the G Bar M Ranch, a 3,200-acre dude ranch that opened in 1934. The ranch itself dates back to 1900. The town is also home to the Old Settler&#x27;s Days, an annual celebration of pioneer history. It includes an art show and parade.

<text>Gardiner is a census-designated place (CDP) in Park County, Montana, United States, along the 45th parallel. As of the 2020 census, the population of the community and nearby areas was 833.

Gardiner was officially founded in 1880. The area has served as a main entrance to Yellowstone National Park since its creation in 1872. Yellowstone National Park Heritage and Research Center, which opened May 18, 2005, is located in Gardiner and houses National Park Service archives, Yellowstone museum collections and reference libraries.

Gardiner was impacted by the 2022 Montana floods.

==History==
The name &quot;Gardiner&quot; derives from Johnson Gardner, a fur trapper who operated in the area in 1830–31. He named the lush headwaters valley of today&#x27;s Gardner River &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Hole&quot;. Originally, named &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Fork&quot;, the river took on Gardner&#x27;s name although prospectors and explorers who visited the area later in the century were unaware of the trapper &quot;Johnson Gardner.&quot; In 1870, when the Washburn–Langford–Doane Expedition passed through the area they began calling the river &quot;Gardiner,&quot; a phonetic error. Hiram M. Chittenden (1895) and Nathaniel P. Langford (1905) confirmed this spelling in their accounts of the expedition.

When the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 passed through the Gardiner area, they encountered two men, named J.C. McCartney and H. R. Horr, who had laid claim to and established a ranch and a bath house on the Mammoth terraces near Liberty Cap. These entrepreneurs eventually established a primitive hotel at Mammoth and were not evicted from the area until many years after the park was established. McCartney also went by the name &quot;Jim Gardiner&quot; and received messages, consignments and such destined for guests of his hotel addressed to: &quot;Jim on the Gardiner&quot;. On February 9, 1880, a territorial post office was established just outside the park boundary and Gardiner, Montana began.

In 1883, the Northern Pacific Railway completed the extension of their &quot;Park Branch Line&quot; from Livingston, Montana to Cinnabar north of Gardiner. In 1903, the line was extended to Gardiner. Railway service at Gardiner station was discontinued in 1948.

<text>Livingston is a city and the county seat of Park County, Montana, United States. It is in southwestern Montana, on the Yellowstone River, north of Yellowstone National Park. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 8,040.

==History==
The founding of the small historical railroad and ranching town of Livingston is a direct result of the Northern Pacific Railway (NPR). This site became a centralized point in the Rocky Mountains and the NPR&#x27;s location for railroad shops to service their steam trains before ascending the Bozeman Pass, the line&#x27;s highest point, located immediately west. Livingston also became the first gateway town to America&#x27;s first national park, Yellowstone, which the NPR promoted heavily to visitors from the East. The NPR also operated a branch line running 50 miles south through Paradise Valley, first to Cinnabar station and later to Yellowstone&#x27;s north entrance in Gardiner.

===Clark City===

Downstream the Yellowstone River, about 3 miles from present-day Livingston, an old fisherman named Amos Benson built a log cabin in 1872. This is where a ferry, a trading post and a small community called Benson&#x27;s Landing were located. Across the river from Benson&#x27;s Landing in June 1882 was the camp of about 40 tents of the Northern Pacific survey crew. This is where they thought the supply store site they were looking for should be. On July 14, 1882, a man who worked for the Northern Pacific named Joseph J. McBride arrived with orders to find another site to build the store. On July 16, George H. Carver, who became a major local businessman and political leader, arrived at the site of present-day Livingston. Carver and McBride became the first local residents when they pitched their tents on the 16th. Also on the 16th arrived 30 freight wagons drawn by 140 oxen, carrying 140,000 lbs. of merchandise. The supply store was to be of Bruns and Kruntz, contractors. Eventually, the tents gave way to log cabins. All of Benson&#x27;s Landing encampment moved up the river to Carver and McBride&#x27;s camp within 10 days of the train&#x27;s arrival.

This new settlement was called &quot;Clark City&quot; after Heman Clark, the principal contractor for the Northern Pacific from the Missouri westward. By fall, the town was well established and a November 1882 poll counted 348 votes for delegates to congress. Clark City was on the southeast side at the East end of Lewis St. just southwest of the KPRK, and is now part of Livingston. B.F. Downen built the first permanent residence (out of wood) and Frank White owned the first saloon. Clark City eventually had 6 general stores, 2 hotels, 2 restaurants, 2 watchmakers, 2 wholesale liquor dealers, 2 meat markets, 3 blacksmiths, 1 hardware store, 30 saloons and a population of 500.

As Clark City was growing, nobody realized that the Northern Pacific had marked on its maps a town called Livingston at the same place. The railroad officially reached Clark City on November 22, 1882. In October 1882 a post office was chartered for Clark City. In November, Livingston received its charter. That was when it was decided that Livingston be located a short distance away. Then Clark City residents bought lots in Livingston and moved. The birth of Livingston was the death of Clark City. The walking distance between them was considerable and Clark City became stream-and-bog urban wildland. Very few buildings still remain.

===Incorporation===

On December 21, 1882, Livingston was incorporated and named in honor of Johnston Livingston, pioneer Northern Pacific Railway stockholder, director and friend of Northern Pacific Railroad President Henry Villard. Johnston Livingston was director from 1875 to 1881 and 1884–1887. Crawford Livingston Jr., Johnston&#x27;s nephew, is more commonly considered the town&#x27;s namesake. Crawford bought the real estate after the survey and on July 17, 1883, established the First National Bank in the city. Often he spoke of Livingston as &quot;his town,&quot; and he apparently enjoyed the publicity of supposedly having a city named for him. But the name Livingston has always stood out in the Northern Pacific official family.

Livingston is along the Yellowstone River, where it bends from north to east toward Billings and in proximity to Interstate 90. In July 1806 Captain William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped on the city&#x27;s present outskirts on the return trip east preparing to descend the Yellowstone River. Clark&#x27;s party rejoined the Lewis party at the confluence with the Missouri River, near Williston, North Dakota.

===Attractions===
Although small, Livingston has a number of popular tourist attractions. The Livingston Depot, built in 1902 after two predecessors, is a restored rail station that houses a railroad museum open from May to September. The Yellowstone Gateway Museum documents regional history from one of the oldest North American archaeological sites to Wild Western and Yellowstone history. The International Fly Fishing Federation&#x27;s museum is an extensive introduction to a popular game sport and hosts annual enthusiast meetings. The city was inhabited for two decades by Calamity Jane and visited by a number of traveling members of European royalty.

In 1938, Dan Bailey, an eastern fly-fisherman, established Dan Bailey&#x27;s Fly Shop and mail order fly tying business on Park Street. Also in Livingston is the Fly Fishing Discovery Center, a museum operated by the Federation of Fly Fishers. Actors Peter Fonda and Margot Kidder, Saturday Night Live alumnus Rich Hall, musician Ron Strykert, novelist Walter Kirn, and poet Jim Harrison have lived in the city. Jimmy Buffett mentions Livingston in multiple songs.

Its economy is flat, and like the rest of the state, the unemployment rate is below the national average. Recently the city has invested in attractions and accommodation for tourists visiting during the Lewis and Clark bicentennial years.

Livingston and its immediately adjacent area has 17 sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, enumerated within Park County&#x27;s NRHP listings.

It has a sister-city relationship with Naganohara, Japan.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Livingston has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

Livingston has some of the warmest winters in the state, but the temperature can feel cold because Livingston is also one of the windiest places in the United States, having the 2nd highest average wind speed among airport/AMOS stations from 2000 to 2010, after Guadalupe Pass, a highway station near Pine Springs, Texas.

<text>One Nation Under a Groove is the tenth studio album by American funk rock band Funkadelic, released on September 22, 1978, on Warner Bros. Records. Recording sessions took place at United Sound Studio in Detroit, with one song recorded live on April 15, 1978, at the Monroe Civic Center in Monroe, Louisiana. The album was the first album to include keyboardist and frequent songwriter Walter &quot;Junie&quot; Morrison.

&quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; was Funkadelic&#x27;s most commercially successful album, reaching number 1 on the Billboard Magazine Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and being certified platinum in the US. It reached number 58 in Canada. It was praised by critics, and appears in several &quot;best album&quot; lists. It was featured on &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century and 51 Essential Albums lists. The album was ranked number 177 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in both 2003 and 2012 editions, before moving to number 360 in the 2020 edition. The album is listed as one of the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

== Music ==
According to the academic Bill Martin, &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; is indebted &quot;a good deal more to progressive rock than most critics are willing to admit, as well as progressive soul, Hendrix, and Sly Stone&quot;.

==Original LP track listing==
In the US, the original album came with a bonus 7-inch EP. In Europe, the Bonus-EP was replaced by a bonus 12-inch 45rpm mini-album containing the 3 EP tracks on one side and an extended version of &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; on the other.


==US Priority CD track listing==
(note that the UK Charly Groove presents side one of the EP (Lunchmeat/PE) as tracks 7 &amp; 8 and side two (Maggot Brain) as track 9.

<doc id="123568" wikidata="Q968779" url="?curid=123568" title="Winnett, Montana">
<text>Winnett is a town in and the county seat of Petroleum County, Montana, United States. The population was 188 at the 2020 census.

In addition to county government offices, Winnett&#x27;s businesses and services include a general store, two filling/service stations, a post office, a school system with grades K-12, an event venue completed in 2023, a motel, 2 RV parks, a campground and a bar-and-grill.

Local news is reported from the &quot;Roundup Record Tribune &amp; Winnett Times&quot;. It is published weekly and also available online.

The nearest medical facilities are in Lewistown.

==History==
Winnett was named for Walter John Winnett (1860–1943), who was born at the Queen&#x27;s Hotel in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Winnett ran away from home as a boy, seeking adventure in &quot;Indian country.&quot; His excellent marksmanship abilities helped him get jobs with outfits who were always looking for someone who could keep them in fresh meat. When he was captured by Sioux Indians and later adopted into the tribe, he was given the name Eagle Eyes because of his remarkable shooting skills.

Winnett established a ranch in Montana Territory in 1879 near an active trading post and the Hangman&#x27;s Tree used by vigilantes in the area. The massive ranch house, which he built in 1900 housed his own family and served as a gathering place for the community. Dances, weddings, funerals, church services, and school were all held here. Billings was the closest town, so Winnett built up a freight line business to haul supplies. Each of his outfits consisted of ten to twenty horses and huge wagons. In 1910 he built a store and petitioned for a post office.

In February 1920, oil was discovered in nearby Cat Creek. Winnett&#x27;s population nearly doubled in less than a year, from 1,213 in April 1922 to over 2,000 in 1923. Buildings could not be built fast enough, and tent homes and businesses appeared. The sudden increase in population drove new demands, and Winnett got its first sidewalks, streets, and water system. Since the oil boom of the 1920s, Winnett has declined both in population and in amenities. Another, smaller oil boom occurred in 1946 when oil was again discovered in Cat Creek.

The Milwaukee Railroad stopped running to Winnett in the early 1970s. The grain elevator is still standing, and graded stretches of land where the tracks used to be are still visible.

The effects of the Bakken oil boom have not had the same effects on Winnett as towns further east such as Glendive or Miles City. However, there have been rumors of oil in other geological formations in the central Montana area near Winnett.

==Geography==
Winnett is located along Montana Highway 200. Highway 244 connects Winnett to Roundup.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

<text>Malta ( ) is a city in, and the county seat of, Phillips County, Montana, United States, located at the intersection of U.S. Routes 2 and 191. The population was 1,860 at the 2020 census.

==History==
After James Hill and his partners built the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba railway (which in 1890 became the Great Northern Railway) across Montana&#x27;s &quot;High Line&quot; in 1887, Malta evolved from rail siding number 54. What came to be Saco, Montana, to the east and Dodson, Montana, to the west grew from other nearby sidings. A post office was established in Malta in 1890. Its name is said to have been determined by a spin of the globe by a Great Northern official whose finger came to rest on the island of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea.

On July 3, 1901, Kid Curry (Harvey Logan), as part of Butch Cassidy&#x27;s Wild Bunch, robbed a train just west of Malta, near Wagner, Montana, making off with about $40,000.

One of the best preserved dinosaurs ever discovered and one of only four that were fossilized is a 77-million-year-old &quot;Brachylophosaurus&quot; nicknamed Leonardo, unearthed north of Malta in 2000. Leonardo, together with brachylophosaurs Elvis (1994), Roberta (2003) and Peanut (2002), is on display at The Great Plains Dinosaur Museum.
