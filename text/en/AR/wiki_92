==History==
Legend has it that the borough&#x27;s name is derived from early European settlers who bought the land from the local Lenape Native Americans in exchange for some rum. But as far back as 1663, long before the area was officially named Rumson, Native Americans called it &quot;Navarumsunk&quot;. Over the years it has been shortened to &quot;Rumson&quot;, though sources also talk of a Chief Alumson as a source of the name. Other names Rumson has been known by include Black Point, Port Washington and Oceanic.

Rumson was purchased by English settlers in pieces. The first purchase was dated January 25, 1665, and it included parts of Middletown. The rest of the area was purchased later that year.

Rumson is known for its many sprawling 19th-century estates located alongside the shores of the Navesink and Shrewsbury rivers and also dotted along the historic Rumson Road (serving as one of Rumson&#x27;s main thoroughfares). Now an upscale commuter suburb, Rumson was once a prominent summer colony for wealthy New York bankers and industrialists during the turn of the century, . The oldest of Rumson&#x27;s homes was the Tredwell House, named after a family that summered there for almost 100 years. The oldest part of the house was from 1670, and the estate once occupied .

Originally, the home sat on of land, which over the years were parceled out, leaving of land. Plans have been submitted to demolish the building, which the developer stated could not be renovated, and to replace it with townhomes that would include affordable housing, leading Preservation New Jersey to declare the home &quot;endangered&quot; as of 2020.

In the 19th century, Rumson&#x27;s summer residents enjoyed many activities, such as swimming and boating in the adjacent Navesink River and the Atlantic Ocean, or taking wagon rides. In winter, residents used the river for ice boating.

<text>Shrewsbury Township is a township situated in the Jersey Shore region, within Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 1,076, a decrease of 65 (−5.7%) from the 2010 census count of 1,141, which in turn reflected an increase of 43 (+3.9%) from the 1,098 counted in the 2000 census.

Covering nearly when it was first formed in 1693, the originally large Shrewsbury Township steadily diminished in size as 74 new municipalities were created from its former boundaries, leaving the township as it currently exists, covering , ranked as New Jersey&#x27;s smallest municipality by area. The combined population of the municipalities that been part of Shrewsbury Township was 935,232 in 2020, which would have made it the 13th largest city in the country, slightly more than that of Fort Worth, Texas.

==History==

Shrewsbury was part of the Navesink Patent or Monmouth Tract granted soon after the creation of East Jersey in 1665.

When it was formed in 1693, Shrewsbury Township covered an area of almost , extending to the north to the Navesink River, south to include all of present-day Ocean County, east to the Atlantic Ocean and west to the present-day border of Monmouth County. It retained its size and scope until 1750, when Stafford Township was formed, taking away most of present-day Ocean County. The Parker Homestead, one of the oldest buildings in state, was built by early settlers to the region.

What is now Shrewsbury Township was originally formed on October 31, 1693, and was created as a township by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798.

=== Creation of new municipalities ===
Over the centuries, portions of the township have been taken to form Stafford Township (March 3, 1750), Dover Township (March 1, 1768, now Toms River Township), Howell Township (February 23, 1801), Ocean Township (February 24, 1849), Atlantic Township (February 18, 1847, now Colts Neck), Red Bank (March 17, 1870), Eatontown (April 4, 1873), Rumson (May 15, 1907), Fair Haven (March 28, 1912), Little Silver (March 19, 1923), Shrewsbury borough (March 22, 1926) and New Shrewsbury (April 15, 1950, now Tinton Falls). The township was named for Shrewsbury, England.

The remaining land was formerly owned by the Government and called Camp Vail, a complex of 265 homes constructed for families of Fort Monmouth employees. After World War II the government planned to close the site but the established families, with nowhere else to go, purchased the land from the Army with the help of Ann Switek who arranged to maintain the Original Township Charter which had been abandoned. Ann Switek was then elected Town Clerk of Shrewsbury Township and maintained that post for close to 50 years. Camp Vail became Alfred Vail Mutual Association, one of New Jersey&#x27;s first cooperative housing entities. Following the end of federal subsidies to Shrewsbury Township schools and services residents of the community outside the Vail Homes felt that the residents in the homes received undue benefits. They attempted to force the Vail Homes out of Shrewsbury Township but were unable to. They instead seceded from Shrewsbury to form New Shrewsbury which was later renamed Tinton Falls.

==Geography==

==History==

Spring Lake was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 14, 1892, from portions of Wall Township, based on the results of a referendum held on March 8, 1892. On February 24, 1903, the borough of North Spring Lake was annexed to Spring Lake. The borough was named for a clear spring-fed lake.

During the &quot;Gilded Age&quot; of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Spring Lake developed into a coastal resort for members of New York City and Philadelphia high society, in similar fashion to the settlements of Newport, Rhode Island, and Bar Harbor, Maine. A surviving example of architecture constructed during this era is the Martin Maloney Cottage on Morris Avenue next to the tycoon&#x27;s former and no longer existent Ballingarry Estate. Another fine example of period architecture listed on the National Register of Historic Places is the Audenried Cottage on Tuttle Avenue.

The owner of the Ballingarry Estate, Marquis Martin Maloney, built St. Catharine Roman Catholic Church on a knoll overlooking the eponymous Spring Lake. The cornerstone of the church was laid on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day in 1901.

The second of the five victims of the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, Charles Bruder, 27, a Swiss bellhop for the Essex and Sussex Hotel, was killed on July 6, 1916, while swimming approximately from shore in Spring Lake. The wave of attacks took place between July 1 and July 12, 1916, along of Atlantic Ocean coastline and is often attributed as having inspired the novel &quot;Jaws&quot; by Peter Benchley and the corresponding film by Steven Spielberg, though Benchley has explicitly denied the claim.

Spring Lake is the setting for the Mary Higgins Clark novel &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot;. The opening scenes of Ulu Grosbard&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; were filmed in Spring Lake. Indie rock band Vampire Weekend filmed a music video for their song &quot;Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa&quot; in a home in Spring Lake, as well as on the beach. Spring Lake was used as a stand-in for turn-of-the-century Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the 1981 film &quot;Ragtime&quot;.

In John Frankenheimer&#x27;s 1962 film &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, the character of Major Bennett Marco (played by Frank Sinatra) suffers from a nightmare set in Spring Lake. He imagines himself and his fellow soldiers sitting through a lecture by Mrs. Henry Whitaker of the Spring Lake Garden Club. A sign reveals the location of the lecture to be the fictional &quot;Spring Lake Hotel&quot;. Eventually, the audience sees that the garden club meeting is merely an illusion and the platoon is actually at a meeting of Russian and Chinese officials in Manchuria. The Mrs. Whitaker character is actually a Chinese scientist named Dr. Yen Lo, portrayed by Spring Lake native Khigh Dhiegh.

<doc id="125514" wikidata="Q1085364" url="?curid=125514" title="Tinton Falls, New Jersey">
<text>Tinton Falls is a borough in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located within the heart of the Jersey Shore region, the borough is a commercial hub of Central Jersey (it is the site of the Jersey Shore Premium Outlets and different corporate headquarters) and is an established bedroom suburb of New York City, in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 19,181, an increase of 1,289 (+7.2%) from the 2010 census count of 17,892, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,839 (+18.9%) from the 15,053 counted in the 2000 census.

The borough was formed as New Shrewsbury by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on August 15, 1950, based on the results of a referendum held on July 18, 1950, after breaking away from Shrewsbury Township. It was renamed &quot;Tinton Falls&quot; in 1975, to avoid postal errors. The name came from Lewis Morris&#x27;s plantation, Tinton Manor (which employed free white workers and slaves) as it featured a gristmill, making it one of New Jersey&#x27;s earliest bustling mill towns. The borough is home to the highest waterfall on New Jersey&#x27;s coastal plain, from which the aforementioned mill generated power.

==History==
The area that is now known as Tinton Falls was originally settled by Europeans in the late 1600s, probably beginning with the initial land purchases from the Lenni Lenape Native Americans in 1664. Water power and iron ore were likely the incentives that encouraged settlement: shortly after [the land was purchased], a man by the name of James Grover had an ironworks built along the river. Grover was likely the founder of the community, which, in the 1600s, was named &quot;New Shrewsbury&quot;. At this time, the waterfall was known to be about high; erosion and the destruction of the dam near the ironworks have led to its diminishment.

===The ironworks===
Grover&#x27;s ironworks was the central fixture of the community, and it was one of the oldest built in the country, predated only by buildings in Jamestown and Massachusetts. In 1675, a half-interest in the ironworks company was purchased by Colonel Lewis Morris, [who obtained a title granting him along the Shrewsbury River]. Morris also obtained land owned by Bartholomew Applegate, who had built a corn mill on the other side of the river. Morris, who procured the land for iron mining, named his holdings &quot;Tintern Manor,&quot; after his family lands in Monmouthshire, Great Britain. Tintern Abbey, located in Monmouthshire, Wales, is often accepted as the namesake of Tinton Falls. In 1691, Colonel Morris died, leaving the ironworks and Tinton Manor (a corruption of &quot;Tintern Manor&quot;) to his nephew of the same name. By 1714, the ironworks had become less profitable, but mention of a Tinton Falls ironworks can be found as late as 1844. Morris brought in dozens of African slaves to mine the ore resulting in the nickname the &quot;Iron Plantation&quot;, with the highest number of slaves being in Tinton Falls at that time in the colony of New Jersey, though in the mid-18th century it had the largest number of emancipated slaves in the 13 colonies, as residents followed the preaching of abolitionist John Woolman.

===Separation from Shrewsbury Township===
In 1693, Tinton Manor and the surrounding lands were defined as part of Shrewsbury Township. At this time, Shrewsbury included all of the land in eastern Monmouth County, but lost land due to the creation of a large number of new municipalities over the years, including the borough of Shrewsbury in 1926. In July 1950, Tinton Falls and Wayside left Shrewsbury Township, renaming themselves the Borough of New Shrewsbury. To avoid postal confusion and mix-ups with the surrounding borough and township of Shrewsbury, the residents of New Shrewsbury voted to rename the community as &quot;The Borough of Tinton Falls&quot; in 1975.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 15.60 square miles (40.41 km2), including 15.48 square miles (40.08 km2) of land and 0.13 square miles (0.33 km2) of water (0.83%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Wayside. Green Grove, Hockhockson, Macedonia, Pine Brook, Reevytown, West Shrewsbury and Wileys Corner are other unincorporated communities located partly or completely within the borough.

The borough borders the Monmouth County municipalities of Colts Neck Township, Eatontown, Middletown Township, Neptune Township, Ocean Township, Red Bank, Shrewsbury, Shrewsbury Township and Wall Township.

==Government==

===Local government===
The Borough of Tinton Falls operates under the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, using the Mayor-Council form of municipal government (Plan 6), implemented by direct petition as of July 1, 1985. The borough is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council. The mayor is the chief executive officer of the borough and is directly elected for a four-year term of office. The borough council, which is the legislative body, includes five members elected at-large on a non-partisan basis for four-year terms on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats up for election every other year as part of the November general election, with the mayoral seat up for vote at the same time that two council seats are being chosen by voters. A business administrator reports to, and may act on behalf of the mayor, in the mayor&#x27;s absence. The Borough Council voted in May 2010 to shift its elections from May to the November general election, as part of an effort to increase participation of voters and to cut costs associated with the May elections, with savings estimated at nearly $100,000 during the first decade after the change was implemented in the November 2011 vote.

In November 2021, Perillo, at 97 years old, was elected for a second four-year term, giving him the nickname &quot;America&#x27;s Oldest Mayor.&quot; He turned 100 on September 22, 2024, but rarely attended council meetings and was often represented by a proxy.

<doc id="125515" wikidata="Q1087531" url="?curid=125515" title="Union Beach, New Jersey">
<text>Union Beach is a borough on Raritan Bay and the northern Jersey Shore in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough is a small coastal bedroom suburb of New York City in the New York metropolitan area, with views of Manhattan visible in the distance from the bayfront beach. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 5,723, a decrease of 522 (−8.4%) from the 2010 census count of 6,245, which in turn reflected a decline of 404 (−6.1%) from the 6,649 counted in the 2000 census.

Union Beach was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 16, 1925, from portions of Raritan Township (now Hazlet), based on the results of a referendum held on April 16, 1925. A farm in the future borough was owned by the Poole family since the days of the American Revolutionary War. Following the development of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Poole Farm became the site of the Union Subdivision in 1908, while an area that had been called East Point Beach Estates was renamed Union Beach by developer Charles Carr in 1920.

Union Beach was part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area&#x27;s economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, dense residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural beauty of the Raritan Bayshore coastline. The plan has since been integrated into the county&#x27;s 2016 master plan.

==Geography==
Union Beach is 16.1 miles from Staten Island&#x27;s Outerbridge. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.88 square miles (4.87 km2), including 1.78 square miles (4.61 km2) of land and 0.10 square miles (0.26 km2) of water (5.32%).

Union Beach has undergone extensive restoration of its beach front, which offers a view of the New York City skyline and the Verazanno Narrows Bridge.

This restoration has occurred in phases and was performed by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District. 

A monument to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, constructed of black stone and dedicated in June 2002, is positioned to allow visitors to see past the memorial towards the location where the World Trade Center towers were visible from the borough.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names within the borough include Lorrillard Beach, Natco, Union Gardens and Van Marters Corner.

The borough borders the Monmouth County municipalities of Hazlet, Keansburg (maritime border) and Keyport.

==History==

===Hurricane Sandy===
On October 28, 2012, at 4:00pm, the mayor issued a mandatory evacuation for the borough in preparation for Hurricane Sandy—the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. When the hurricane arrived, approximately one third of the borough&#x27;s 6,200 residents had left.
By the morning of October 29, of the estimated 2,143 households in the borough, approximately 200 homes and businesses were damaged, 400 took on more than of water, and 62 were &quot;completely missing&quot;. An additional 100 that had shifted off foundations and were no longer habitable. The borough&#x27;s police department borrowed several police cruisers from other municipalities such as Wilmington, NC and Clay County, Florida. Most cars were destroyed when flooding reached police headquarters. Former residents from around the country mobilized and organized relief efforts: sending relief supplies; including advising and assisting public servants in acquiring replacements of lost emergency vehicles. In total, the borough lost 14 police cars, three ambulances and four fire trucks. Madison Township and Wanaque each gave repurposed police cruisers fully decaled with Union Beach logos, as well as other relief. Some local agencies sold old police cruisers for one dollar each or donated police cars, and donations of two cars each came from North Carolina and Florida. EMS and fire trucks were also donated from near and far.

Jakeabob&#x27;s Bay, a restaurant and waterfront tiki bar and one of the major employers in town, which survived Hurricane Irene in 2011, was destroyed in the hurricane. The storm surge completely washed through the building, pushing out tables, chairs, menus and displays. The restaurant owner, Gigi Liaguno-Dorr, organized the relief and rebuilding efforts for Union Beach. The building was razed when the insurance companies that covered the restaurant would not pay out. A new temporary restaurant was built but did not manage to renew its lease due to insurance disputes with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Union Beach Memorial School, the borough&#x27;s only school, was inundated with floodwaters and debris when the storm surge and extreme high tide swept through the borough. The school had been used as an evacuation center but began taking on water as the storm raged. Hundreds of library books and teaching materials were destroyed along with thousands of dollars worth of instruments. After several months of emergency repairs by volunteers, including students and teachers, the renovations including new floors, walls, desks and murals were finished prior to the end of the school year.

==Demographics==
===2000 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 6,245 people, 2,143 households, and 1,624 families in the borough. The population density was 3,461.5 per square mile (1,336.5/km2). There were 2,269 housing units at an average density of 1,257.7 per square mile (485.6/km2). The racial makeup was 91.05% (5,686) White, 1.54% (96) Black or African American, 0.16% (10) Native American, 1.81% (113) Asian, 0.00% (0) Pacific Islander, 3.09% (193) from other races, and 2.35% (147) from two or more races.

<text>Wall Township is a township within Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Crisscrossed by several different highways within the heart of the Jersey Shore region, the township is a transportation hub of Central New Jersey and a bedroom suburb of New York City, in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, Wall Township&#x27;s population was 26,525, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 361 (+1.4%) from the 2010 census count of 26,164, which in turn reflected an increase of 903 (+3.6%) from the 25,261 counted in the 2000 census.

Wall Township was formally incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 7, 1851. Over the years, portions of the township have been taken to form North Spring Lake (May 1884), Ocean Beach (March 9, 1885, now Belmar), Manasquan (December 30, 1887), Spring Lake (March 14, 1892), Sea Girt (March 29, 1917), Brielle (April 10, 1919), South Belmar (March 12, 1924, since renamed as Lake Como) and Spring Lake Heights (March 19, 1927).

Wall Township was named for General Garret D. Wall (1783–1850), a lawyer who commanded a Trenton volunteer company during the War of 1812 and was stationed at Sandy Hook. Wall served five years as clerk of the New Jersey Supreme Court and as quartermaster general of the state for more than 20 years before being chosen to represent the state in the United States Senate from 1835 to 1841.

==History==

The Greenville Cemetery was established in 1734, when a casualty of the French and Indian War was buried there. The original structure of the Glendola Protestant Bible Church was built in 1776; The congregation dedicated a new church in 1964.

Allaire Village dates back to 1822, when James P. Allaire purchased what became known as the Howell Works in Wall, and though it was the largest producing bog iron manufacturing site in New Jersey by 1836, the ironworks were shut down in 1846. The village and surrounding acres were later preserved and gifted to the State of New Jersey to form Allaire State Park as a memorial to Hearst editor Arthur Brisbane, the last private owner of the site, who purchased the land in 1907 and built a palatial residence on that property that would later serve as the Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center. The Brisbane family donated the property to the State of New Jersey to establish Allaire State Park and the Historic Village at Allaire. Allaire Village Inc., a non-profit organization, is licensed by the State of New Jersey to operate the site now known as &quot;The Historic Village at Allaire.&quot;

The Allgor–Barkalow Homestead at 1701 New Bedford Road was constructed in 1840, although some accounts indicate construction of part of the building began in the 18th century. The building now houses the museum of the Old Wall Historical Society. The Blansingburg schoolhouse at Sea Girt Avenue opened in 1855; The building was relocated in 1999 to the Allgor-Barkalow Homestead Museum property for refurbishing.

Wall Township was formed in 1851, from portions of Howell Township.

The newly formed Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, with its home office in England, purchases a farm around 1900 that became the site of the company&#x27;s receiver equipment for commercial transatlantic radio operation. The Marconi signal site was abandoned in 1924, but it was later occupied by the Ku Klux Klan until they were ejected in March 1928. The United States Army purchased the Marconi site in November 1941 and named it Camp Evans.

The Allenwood Hospital, located at the corner of Squankum-Allenwood and Hospital roads, opened in January 1921 as a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients. In 1957, a 16-room building is dedicated to Geraldine L. Thompson, who served as president of the hospital&#x27;s board of managers. In the 1960s, the facility becomes an annex to the John L. Montgomery Medical Home in Freehold Township, a county-run nursing home, and was renamed the Geraldine L. Thompson Care Center. In early 2016, Monmouth County finalized the sale of the nursing home to Preferred Care Holdings LLC for $15 million, which was renamed Preferred Care at Wall.
In 1940, Edward I. Brown used an old World War I tank converted into a bulldozer to clear land for an airport that he turned into what is now Monmouth Executive Airport after completing his service in the United States Navy as a pilot during World War II; The airport was sold by the Brown family in 2007 to a private equity firm, despite lengthy attempts by Monmouth County to acquire the facility.

Wall Stadium, which opened in 1950, is located just south of Monmouth Executive Airport and north of Interstate 195 on Route 34 and was the first track that NASCAR champion Richard Petty raced on in the United States. In 2019, plans were announced to close the track after the 2020 season and construct houses on the site.
The Roadside Diner, formerly the Circle Diner and Rusty&#x27;s, was delivered to its Route 34 site by the Silk City Diner Co. in the 1940s. The diner was used for filming of a scene for the 1983 movie &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot; and appears on the cover of the 1994 Bon Jovi album &quot;Cross Road: 14 Classic Grooves&quot;, as well as having been featured in the 2008 music video for &quot;Girls in Their Summer Clothes&quot; by Bruce Springsteen.

Wall High School opened in September 1959, while Wall Intermediate School opened in 1967.

Interstate 195 was extended into Wall Township in 1981, giving direct high-speed access to Trenton.

A suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in December 1999 against the township over a holiday display that included a nativity scene and a Hannukah menorah, contending that the religious symbols violate the constitutional separation of church and state, was dismissed by a judge who ruled that the organization had filed its suit too close to the start of the holiday season. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a ruling in April 2001 vacating the decision of the district court in the case that the township&#x27;s holiday display as modified in 2000 to include other seasonal decorations did not violate the Establishment Clause or the New Jersey Constitution and ruling that the ACLU lacked standing to file the case.

Even though many of the surrounding municipalities sprung out of Wall Township, the only ZIP code that exclusively serves areas of Wall is Allenwood, but even it relies solely on a Post-office box system for regular mail services.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 31.69 square miles (82.08 km2), including 30.66 square miles (79.41 km2) of land and 1.03 square miles (2.67 km2) of water (3.25%).

Wreck Pond is a tidal pond located on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by Wall Township and the boroughs of Spring Lake, Spring Lake Heights, and Sea Girt. The Wreck Pond watershed covers about in eastern Monmouth County.

The township borders the municipalities of Belmar, Brielle, Colts Neck Township, Howell Township, Lake Como, Manasquan, Neptune Township, Sea Girt, Spring Lake, Spring Lake Heights and Tinton Falls in Monmouth County; and Brick Township in Ocean County.

In 2005, the Township de-annexed its southernmost portion in favor of Howell Township.

Wall is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. It is the oldest form of government in New Jersey, having been first established in 1798, and enhanced by the Township Act of 1989. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. Each year, at the annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to preside as mayor for the year, and another to serve as deputy mayor. It is the only form of government in which the mayor is not elected directly by the voters of the municipality. Wall is one of 11 Monmouth County municipalities that use the Township form of government.

The village was later established as a bog iron furnace originally known as Williamsburg Forge &#x27;Monmouth Furnace&#x27; was then renamed the Howell Works by Benjamin B. Howell. In 1822, it was then purchased by philanthropist James P. Allaire, who endeavoured to turn into a self-contained community. The wood burning furnace business collapsed in 1846 and the village closed. During its height in the mid 19th century, the community supported about 500 people and was a bustling mill town.

The Allaire Village was Dedicated as a State Park in June 1957 and officially reopened by Governor Robert B. Meyner on May 24, 1958. The museum was established through the efforts of the New Jersey State Federation of Woman&#x27;s Clubs in 1958. Although the restoration of the Village is not yet complete, the buildings that remain, the interpretive programs based on a multitude of available primary records, and even the landscape make Allaire Village a rare resource. Through them, visitors are able to experience and better understand the forces that shaped New Jersey&#x27;s industrial power in the early-mid 19th century.

<text>West Freehold is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) within Freehold Township, in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2020 census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 13,596. Due to the community&#x27;s proximity to the Battle of Monmouth, West Freehold is home to several important historical structures, which have been preserved in the West Freehold Village Historic District.

==History==
New Jersey became a colony of England on June 24, 1664, after the Duke of York granted a patent to Sir George Carteret and Lord John Berkely for what is now New Jersey.

West Freehold (also historically known as &quot;Mount&#x27;s Corner&quot;) was settled as early as the late seventeenth century primarily by English and Scottish Presbyterians, Baptists, and Quakers escaping religious persecution from Scotland and nearby New England. A major transportation artery that was located in West Freehold was the Burlington Path, a stagecoach route that connected Burlington, which was at the time the capital of West Jersey, and Perth Amboy, which was at the time the capital of East Jersey. Much of modern-day Monmouth Road/West Main Street (County Route 537) coincides in general direction and trajectory with this historic stagecoach route. Many colonial-era structures are still standing in the West Freehold Village Historic District, near the intersection of West Main Street and Stillwells Corner Road/Wemrock Road.

The Battle of Monmouth during the American Revolutionary War was fought in countryside less than northwest of West Freehold.

===Mount&#x27;s Tavern===
Today known as Moore&#x27;s Tavern &amp; Restaurant, this tavern at the corner of Main Street and Stillwells Corner Road is one of the most well-known historic structures in Freehold Township. As a stagecoach stop for the Burlington Path, there is documentation of the tavern&#x27;s license being renewed from 1787, suggesting that the tavern was in use prior to that. Moses Mount, a private during the Revolutionary War and aide to George Washington, was the inn&#x27;s first keeper.

===Levi Solomon Farmstead===

Freehold Township in its early days was a place of refuge for persecuted religious groups, such as Presbyterians, Baptists, and Quakers. The Solomon family were some of New Jersey&#x27;s earliest Jewish settlers. They settled on a large piece of farmland, roughly where much of the present Mount&#x27;s Corner Shopping Center is located, as early as 1720. During the Battle of Monmouth, their dwelling suffered significant damage from invading British troops. Luckily, matriarch Hannah Solomon, who was widowed, and her two sons were able to save their house after it was set on fire. The original barn that was built on the farm in the 1800s is now the location of the Monmouth County Jewish Heritage Museum, &quot;dedicated to the promotion of public awareness of the county&#x27;s Jewish heritage for the education and enjoyment of both children and adults.&quot;

===West Freehold Schoolhouse===
Located at what is now Wemrock Road, adjacent to West Main Street, this schoolhouse was built in 1848 and educated the children that lived within the community until 1937. The property was part of the Rulif R. Schanck Farmstead, which is now the Elizabeth Oakley Farm (Museum).

===Walker, Combs, Hartshorne, Oakley Farmstead===

Operated for centuries, this property is the earliest remaining farmstead in Freehold and is one of the oldest preserved structures in Monmouth County. Settled in 1686, the property was situated on of land, owned by East Jersey proprietors John Barclay, Robert Barclay, John Reid and John Bowne. Since then, the farmstead had been transferred/sold by multiple families, including Barclay, Reid, Bowne, Clark, Walker, Combs, Schanck, Hartshorne, and Oakley.

By 1981, the farmstead was the largest operating farm in Monmouth County. At that time, Elizabeth Oakley was the last to inhabit the structure and was fascinated in the home&#x27;s rich history. She worked hard to preserve it, having accomplished her life&#x27;s goal in having the farm added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

===Toll House===

The Toll House located on the property of the Walker, Combs, Hartshorne, Oakley Farmstead is one of only two remaining toll houses in New Jersey. Built in ca. 1850, it was owned and operated by a group of farmers living along the Burlington Path. The toll separated two sides of the two-lane stagecoach route: the side heading southwest towards Smithburg, known as the Freehold-Smithburg Turnpike, and the side heading northeast towards &quot;Elk&#x27;s Point&quot; (what is now Freehold Borough).

==Geography==
West Freehold is in central Monmouth County and central Freehold Township. It is southwest of Freehold Borough, the Monmouth county seat. The New Jersey Route 33 freeway forms the northern edge of the West Freehold CDP, while U.S. Route 9 passes through the east side of the community. Route 33 leads east to its terminus at Ocean Grove and west to the New Jersey Turnpike at Hightstown, while US 9 leads north past Freehold Borough to Perth Amboy and south to Toms River.

Monmouth Battlefield State Park is northwest of the historic center of West Freehold.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the West Freehold CDP had a total area of , including of land and of water (0.24%).

===Neighborhoods===
There are many residential neighborhoods in West Freehold, consisting mainly of single-family homes. The two largest neighborhoods are Stonehurst East and Stonehurst West. The homes in Stonehurst were primarily built in the 1960s and 1970s, on large swaths of former farmland.

Raintree is a mixed-use lifestyle center centrally located near County Route 537. The gated community features condominiums that were built in the 1980s and 1990s, along with a wide array of amenities offered to its residents. The Raintree Town Center is the shopping center in the area.

<text>West Long Branch is a borough situated within the Jersey Shore region, in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,587, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 490 (+6.1%) from the 2010 census count of 8,097, which in turn reflected a decline of 161 (−1.9%) from the 8,258 counted in the 2000 census. West Long Branch is the home of Monmouth University.

==History==
Prior to being called West Long Branch, the area had been called Mechanicsville from the 18th century through the Civil War, and then Branchburg in the 1870s. The name West Long Branch appears in the 1889 &quot;Wolverton Atlas of Monmouth County&quot;, and seems to have derived its name from its proximity to a section of the Shrewsbury River.

In 1908, the residents of what was the West Long Branch section of Eatontown thought that they were not getting a fair return on their taxes. A request was made that the West Long Branch section be separated from Eatontown. The Township of Eatontown strongly resisted as there were several large estates in the West Long Branch section that were a source of considerable tax revenues. An act of the New Jersey Legislature was passed on April 7, 1908, and the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders authorized an election. On May 5, 1908, a referendum was held in West Long Branch, with voters approving the separation. The borough takes its name from Long Branch, which in turn takes its name from the &quot;long branch&quot; or south branch of the Shrewsbury River.

<text>Bradley Beach is a borough in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,282, a decrease of 16 (−0.4%) from the 2010 census count of 4,298, which in turn had reflected a decrease of 495 (−10.3%) from the 4,793 counted at the 2000 census. The summer population can reach 30,000.

==History==
Bradley Beach was named for James A. Bradley, the developer responsible for the creation of the Bradley Beach and Asbury Park. In 1871, William B. Bradner, with James A. Bradley as an investor, acquired of land north of Avon-by-the-Sea, and south of Ocean Grove. At the time the area where they had purchased their land was known informally as Ocean Park and was part of Ocean Township and later became part of Neptune Township.

Citizens appealed to the New Jersey Legislature for a referendum to separate Bradley Beach from Neptune Township, and on March 13, 1893, Bradley Beach was incorporated, based on the results of a referendum held on March 6, 1893. The borough&#x27;s incorporation was confirmed on March 13, 1925.

The borough was the first place in the United States to charge sea bathers for beach access when it began minting its own tin badges starting in 1929. In the mid-20th century, Bradley Beach became known as &quot;Chinatown by the Sea&quot;, in reference to the significant number of Chinese people who migrated to the borough from Chinatown, Manhattan.

Sand dunes were constructed on the borough&#x27;s beaches in 2000 at a cost of $10,000, using snow fences and discarded Christmas trees to build a base of wind-driven sand that rose , atop which dune grass was planted. These dunes did little to provide protection from the havoc wreaked by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. Damage in the borough to beach areas and homes near the shore was more than $3 million, while some neighboring communities that hadn&#x27;t constructed such dunes also suffered similar damage.

The borough had gone into decline after World War II, with growth returning around 2000 as seasonal visitors and new residents purchased properties, which borough regulations require that they must be renovated on the same footprint as the original home.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.63 square miles (1.64 km2), including 0.61 square miles (1.58 km2) of land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) of water (3.33%).

The borough is one of 18 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government, which is only available to municipalities with a population less than 12,000 at the time of adoption. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the four-member borough council, whose members are elected at-large in nonpartisan elections. The mayor is elected to a four-year term of office and the four council members are chosen to serve three-year terms on a concurrent basis. As of 2010, the borough&#x27;s nonpartisan elections were shifted from May to the November general election as part of an effort to reduce costs and increase voter participation. The borough had previously operated under the Walsh Act form of New Jersey municipal government starting in 1915, and used a five-member commission, with one member selected to serve as mayor.

, the mayor of Bradley Beach is Alan N. Gubitosi, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2028. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Jane DeNoble, Shana Greenblatt (elected to serve an unexpired term), Paul Nowicki and John Weber, all serving concurrent terms ending December 31, 2025.

The five members of a Charter Study Commission began meetings in December 2024 to consider possible changes to the borough&#x27;s form of government. The commission will report, having been allocated $50,000 for its work. A report will be produced by August and if a charter change is recommended, the voters will make the choice to accept the change as part of the November 2025 general election.

<text>Eatontown is a borough in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 13,597, an increase of 888 (+7.0%) from the 2010 census count of 12,709, which in turn reflected a decline of 1,299 (−9.3%) from the 14,008 counted in the 2000 census.

The community that is now Eatontown was originally incorporated as Eatontown Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 4, 1873, from portions of Ocean Township and Shrewsbury Township. Portions of the township were taken to form West Long Branch (April 7, 1908) and Oceanport (April 6, 1920). Eatontown was reincorporated as a borough on March 8, 1926, replacing Eatontown Township, based on the results of a referendum held on April 13, 1926. The borough was named for Thomas Eaton, an early settler who built a mill .

The United States Army&#x27;s Fort Monmouth operated in Eatontown from 1917 until its closure in September 2011, based on recommendations from the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. It was home to the United States Army Materiel Command&#x27;s Communication and Electronics Command. Fort Monmouth was also home to the United States Military Academy Preparatory School, which trains approximately 250 students per year to enter as freshmen (plebes) at the United States Military Academy at West Point.

In the center of Eatontown is the Monmouth Mall, located at the intersection of Route 35 and Route 36, featuring a variety of stores, restaurants, and a 15-screen cineplex, with a gross leasable area of . Celebrity chef Bobby Flay previously owned a restaurant in Eatontown.

==History==
Eatontown&#x27;s history is documented in the book &quot;Eatontown and Fort Monmouth.&quot;

In 1670, Thomas Eaton (for which the town is named) surveyed the area and constructed a grist mill in present-day Wampum Lake Park.

From the book &quot;Eatontown and Fort Monmouth&quot;:

By 1796, a village had developed across from Eaton&#x27;s mill, with a tannery and general store on the east side of the Red Bank Turnpike &quot;[now State Route 35]&quot;. A tavern for the New York - Philadelphia stage coach trade was built on what would become the intersection of Main and Broad Streets. A second stage coach stop was established in Mechanicsville on the ocean-bound road. This village would later be called West Long Branch.

By 1850, Eaton&#x27;s village had grown to include four stores on Main Street and nearly forty homes. The Eatontown Steamboat Company built docks on Oceanport Creek to ship milled flour and other farm produce up the South Shrewsbury River to markets in New York City. Entrepreneur James P. Allaire built a four-story stone warehouse at the docks, from which he shipped his bog iron forged at the Howell Works 15 miles away. 
In 1886, a mob broke into the jail and removed a black man, Samuel &quot;Mingo Jack&quot; Johnson, who was being held for the alleged rape of a white woman. The mob brutally beat and then hanged Johnson, the father of five. Later events show that it was extremely unlikely that Johnson was guilty of the crime. In 2012, mayor Gerald Tarantolo issued a public apology for the failure of security at the jail.

In 2020, Eatontown was to celebrate its 350th anniversary, but most of the activities were delayed due to COVID-19 concerns.

<doc id="125527" wikidata="Q1089880" url="?curid=125527" title="Keyport, New Jersey">
<text>Keyport is a borough in northern Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A waterfront community located on the Raritan Bay in the Raritan Valley region, the borough is a commuter town of New York City in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,204, a decrease of 36 (−0.5%) from the 2010 census count of 7,240, which in turn reflected a decline of 328 (−4.3%) from the 7,568 counted in the 2000 census. Keyport&#x27;s nickname is the &quot;Pearl of the Bayshore&quot; or the &quot;Gateway to the Bayshore&quot;.

Keyport was originally formed as a Town on March 17, 1870, from portions of Raritan Township (now Hazlet). On April 2, 1908, the Borough of Keyport was formed, replacing Keyport Town.

Keyport was part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area&#x27;s economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, dense residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural Raritan Bayshore coastline. The plan has since been integrated into the 2016 Monmouth County Master Plan. According to the Monmouth County Master Plan, Keyport has been designated as an Arts, Cultural, and Entertainment (ACE) Hub, which is defined as municipalities that have a high concentration of arts and cultural activities to serve as a destination for both visitors and locals, usually including an active nightlife scene in proximity to said cultural activities. Only eight towns in Monmouth County share this designation, with two additional towns designated as upcoming ACE hubs, including nearby Matawan.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.46 square miles (3.77 km2), including 1.38 square miles (3.58 km2) of land and 0.07 square miles (0.19 km2) of water (5.07%).

The borough borders Union Beach (which shares the same postal zip code) and the townships of Aberdeen and Hazlet to the northeast, southwest and southeast respectively.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 7,240 people, 3,067 households, and 1,693 families in the borough. The population density was 5,188.4 per square mile (2,003.3/km2). There were 3,272 housing units at an average density of 2,344.8 per square mile (905.3/km2). The racial makeup was 80.00% (5,792) White, 7.20% (521) Black or African American, 0.28% (20) Native American, 2.38% (172) Asian, 0.03% (2) Pacific Islander, 7.62% (552) from other races, and 2.50% (181) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 18.26% (1,322) of the population.

Of the 3,067 households, 23.4% had children under the age of 18; 39.7% were married couples living together; 11.0% had a female householder with no husband present and 44.8% were non-families.

==Economy==

Keyport is known for its oyster industry, which had been one of the world&#x27;s largest suppliers until overfishing and pollution led to a collapse of the industry in the early to mid 20th century. In August 2010, NY/NJ Baykeeper suspended an effort to recreate the oyster reefs in Keyport&#x27;s Raritan Bay after the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection cited concerns that the oysters could be harvested and sold to the public despite the persistent heavy pollution in the water after concerns had been raised by the United States Food and Drug Administration that patrols were insufficient to ensure that the oysters in the reef were not being harvested.

It was the home of the Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company which operated from 1914 to 1930 and built seaplanes for the United States Navy during World War I. Its planes were mostly military seaplanes and flying boats, including aircraft that offered some of the first scheduled air service using seaplanes.

Keyport has been credited as the birthplace of the &quot;Lazy Susan&quot;, designed by William Bedle in 1845. However this is highly disputed since there were earlier dated pieces found in China and England. It was the site of the professional dance debut of film star Fred Astaire in 1903 at age four, together with his sister Adele, as part of an act that earned a review that called the duo &quot;the greatest child act in vaudeville.

===Business district===
Keyport is home to many diverse businesses, and has a bustling shopping district located on West Front Street, located one block in from the waterfront. The business district is now under control of the Keyport Bayfront Business Cooperative (which was established in 2011 to replace the now-defunct Keyport Business Alliance) which helps to organize events that benefit the businesses in Keyport as well as the city as a whole.

Keyport is home to many restaurants, many with live music. Celebrity Chef Bobby Flay filmed a segment for CBS Sunday Morning at the Broad Street Diner, which has won numerous awards and accolades.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===
Keyport is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the Borough Council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council is comprised of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The Borough form of government used by Keyport is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council.

, the mayor of Keyport is Republican Rose P. Araneo, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Borough Council members are Council President Melissa Vecchio (R, 2025), Heather B. Brady (D, 2026), Stephen D. Gross (D, 2026), Joseph Merla (R, 2027), Kathleen McNamara (D, 2027), Cathleen Reilly (R, 2025).

J. Christopher Demarest was selected by the borough council in January 2023 from a list of three residents nominated by the Republican municipal committee to temporarily fill the seat expiring in December 2024 that became vacant when Rose P. Araneo took office as mayor; Demarest will serve on an interim basis until the November 2023 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.

On Election Day, November 7, 2007, Council President Robert Bergen was elected Mayor, taking the seat of two-term incumbent John J. Merla who pled guilty to federal corruption charges on January 18, 2007, for accepting bribes to obtain municipal contracts. Bergen assumed the post of Mayor on January 1, 2007.

<doc id="125528" wikidata="Q1088800" url="?curid=125528" title="Sea Bright, New Jersey">
<text>Sea Bright is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore, within Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,449, an increase of 37 (+2.6%) from the 2010 census count of 1,412, which in turn had reflected a decline of 406 (−22.3%) from the 1,818 counted in the 2000 census.

Sea Bright was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 21, 1889, from portions of Ocean Township, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day. The borough was reincorporated on March 10, 1897. Additional portions of Ocean Township were annexed by the borough in March 1909.

Some sources attribute the name to a suggestion made by Martha Bayard Stevens, The borough and other sources say that the borough was named for Sea Bright, England, though there is no evidence such a place exists. Earlier sources often spell it as one word, &quot;Seabright&quot;, as seen in the United States Coast Guard&#x27;s Station Seabright and the Seabright Lawn Tennis and Cricket Club.

==History==
In the early 1840s, the area of present-day Sea Bright was a fishing community of simple shacks near the beach dunes; Ocean House, the area&#x27;s first hotel, opened in 1842, featuring access to fishing and sea bathing. The area was called &quot;Nauvoo&quot;, a Native American word, meaning &quot;bright sea&quot;. An alternative explanation, which the borough credits as the source, is that the name is derived from the Hebrew language meaning &quot;pleasant place,&quot; which was the same name that Mormon leader Joseph Smith gave to Nauvoo, the Illinois town he founded in 1839. Smith is said to have visited Monmouth County during a missionary journey in 1840.

The first bridge across the Shrewsbury River connecting Sea Bright to Rumson was constructed in 1870. After several iterations of the bridge, Monmouth County had announced plans for a replacement of the existing span built in 1950 that connects to Ocean Avenue in Sea Bright with a new bridge, due to the structural deficiency and function obsolete state of the existing structure. They predicted that the project would be completed in 2020 at a site south of the current crossing. The current bridge, which is becoming harder to maintain over time, has been repaired twice in the 21st century, once in 2002 and again in 2013. A bridge replacement project is scheduled to end in 2025. The new bridge will include two wide shoulders, something the original bridge lacked. It will also include other improvements, such as modernized draw controls, a access ramp to the nearby Sea Bright Beach from the Route 36 intersection, pedestrian beacons and striped crosswalks with the Ward Avenue intersection, and upgrades to the nearby Sea Bright park. Demolition of a nearby Dunkin&#x27; Donuts was deemed necessary in order to construct the replacement bridge.

The Sea Bright Skiff was developed on the Jersey Shore in the early 19th century for fishing offshore, by being launched through the surf and returned to shore.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.29 square miles (3.33 km2), including 0.72 square miles (1.86 km2) of land and 0.57 square miles (1.47 km2) of water (43.88%).

Sea Bright has seven members-only beach clubs, of which five are in the North Beach area: Ship Ahoy, Sands, Surfrider, Sea Bright Beach Club and Chapel Beach Club; and two are south of the center of town: Driftwood and Edgewater. These clubs charge thousands of dollars for membership and have waiting lists of several years for prospective members. In addition, there is a large public, municipal beach in the center of town, protected by lifeguards, with entry limited to those who have purchased a beach badge. The traditional surfing beach area, called the Anchorage, is free and public, but unguarded. In addition, there are numerous public access stairs to other unguarded beaches for fishing, recreation and suntanning.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names within Sea Bright include Low Moor, Navesink Beach and Normandie. Sea Bright–Monmouth Beach Seawall runs the length of the town.

The borough borders the Monmouth County municipalities of Highlands, Middletown Township, Monmouth Beach and Rumson. Sea Bright is located on the barrier peninsula that separates the Atlantic Ocean from the Navesink and Shrewsbury rivers.

<text>Shrewsbury is a borough in eastern Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located within the heart of the northern Jersey Shore region, the borough is a bedroom community of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,184, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 375 (+9.8%) from the 2010 census count of 3,809, which in turn reflected an increase of 219 (+6.1%) from the 3,590 counted in the 2000 census.

Shrewsbury was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 22, 1926, from portions of Shrewsbury Township, based on the results of a referendum held on May 11, 1926. The borough&#x27;s name comes from Shrewsbury, England.

==History==

Shrewsbury was part of the Navesink Patent or Monmouth Tract granted soon after the creation of East Jersey in 1665. The tract included Shrewsbury, along with the other historic communities of Freehold Township in western Monmouth County and Middletown Township in northern Monmouth County.

When it was formed in 1693, Shrewsbury covered an area of almost , extending to the north to the Navesink River, south to include all of present-day Ocean County, east to the Atlantic Ocean and west to the present-day border of Monmouth County. It retained its size and scope until 1750, when various different municipalities began to break off from it. The first of those being Stafford Township, which was formed in 1750 and taking away much of modern-day Ocean County. The Parker Homestead, one of the oldest structures in the state, was built by early settlers to the region. Many of the early settlers of the region originated from Long Island, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.

What is now Shrewsbury Township was originally formed on October 31, 1693, and was created as a township by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Shrewsbury Borough broke off from Shrewsbury Township, and was officially established on May 11, 1926.

The borough borders the Monmouth County municipalities of Eatontown, Little Silver, Oceanport, Red Bank, Shrewsbury Township and Tinton Falls.

The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Shrewsbury is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie.

<doc id="125532" wikidata="Q599684" url="?curid=125532" title="Boonton, New Jersey">
<text>Boonton () is a town in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 8,815, an increase of 468 (+5.6%) from the 2010 census count of 8,347, which in turn reflected a decline of 149 (−1.8%) from the 8,496 counted in the 2000 census. The settlement was originally called &quot;Boone-Towne&quot; in 1761 in honor of the Colonial Governor Thomas Boone.

Boonton was originally formed on March 16, 1866, within portions of Hanover Township and Pequannock Township. The town was reincorporated and became fully independent on March 18, 1867.

The development of Boonton began in about 1829, as a result of the construction of the Morris Canal and the formation of the New Jersey Iron Company. The original location of the town is now largely under the Jersey City Reservoir, completed in 1904. In 1908, the waters from this reservoir were the first municipal water supply in the United States to be chlorinated. The decision to build the chlorination system was made by John L. Leal and the facility was designed by George W. Fuller.

==History==
During the 18th century, the settlement of Boonetown Falls (variously spelled as Booneton or the current Boonton) was established on the Rockaway River, about downstream from the current site of the town. As early as 1747, Obadiah Baldwin ran an iron refining forge there. He used the iron ore and charcoal available in the area together with water power from the river. As the ironworks grew, workers and their families formed a community in 1761 that was named &quot;Boone-Towne&quot; in honor of the Colonial Governor, Thomas Boone.

The present town developed separately from the settlement of Booneton Falls. The population moved away after 1830, when a canal was completed that drew off business and traffic. The site of Old Boonton downriver has been covered since 1903 by the Jersey City reservoir formed on the dammed river.

===Ironworks===

The Boonton Iron Works were founded about 1770 by Samuel Ogden of Newark, New Jersey. Together with brothers, he purchased a tract along the Rockaway River. Throughout the American Revolutionary War, the Booneton Iron Works was busily engaged in supplying numerous miscellaneous iron products for the military. After the war, operations at Boonton were continued under John Jacob Faesch and his two sons, and, later, by William Scott. He tried to revive the declining business. In 1824, Scott&#x27;s interest in rejuvenating the antiquated ironworks faded when he learned that the Morris Canal was soon to be constructed, and that it would bypass the community of Booneton or more away.

But the proximity of the canal to Booneton Falls made that site ideal for a large factory. In 1830, a group of businessmen in New York City incorporated as the New Jersey Iron Company, with a capitalization of $283,000. Machinery and ironworkers were imported from England, and with the erection of the mills, a new community, called Booneton Falls, began to be developed on the rugged hillside overlooking the river.

The community Main Street is unique in that it is pitched against a cliff overlooking the &#x27;Hollow&#x27; of the Rockaway River. This was said to follow an old Native American trail, developed from a deer path along the hillside.

The new Iron Company flourished for nearly 50 years. The settlement of Booneton Falls—like the older Booneton downstream—was essentially a one-industry town. After the Company closed down its operations in 1876, the town was on the verge of collapse. Although several attempts—one by Joseph Wharton—were made to re-establish iron works on a smaller scale, none endured for any great length of time. In the 21st century, only vestiges of foundations and structures remain in the &quot;Hollow&quot; between Plane Street and the river, to remind Boonton of its own Iron Age.

===Other industries===

One of the first of the new industries secured for the town was a silk factory, which, as Pelgram &amp; Meyer, and, later as Van Raalte, Inc., contributed materially to the town&#x27;s prosperity. Others that followed were a knife factory, a paper mill (at the old settlement, by then called Old Boonton), a nail factory, a brass and iron foundry, and a carriage factory. The Morris Canal, although going into a rapid decline when superseded by railroads, still employed a number of men. The Lackawanna Railroad completed its Boonton Branch in 1870, giving employment to a number of Boonton people and providing commuter service to Boonton residents who worked in New York City. The town supported many individually owned businesses, such as blacksmith shops, machine shops, bakeries and a miscellany of stores, which began to prosper anew as the nation emerged from the depression of the 1870s.

In 1891, the Loanda Hard Rubber Company was founded by Edwin A. Scribner, and began the manufacture of molded hard rubber products. After Scribner died, the management of the firm fell to his son-in-law Richard W. Seabury. In 1906, Seabury learned of experiments with synthetic resins made by Leo Baekeland, for whom Bakelite was later to be named. Originally intended by Baekeland for a synthetic varnish, the new material was used by Seabury in making the world&#x27;s first molding of organic plastics in 1907. Boontonware, a molded plastic dinnerware, was sold nationwide.

George Scribner, son of Loanda founder Edwin Scribner, opted to continue the business of plastics molding and established Boonton Molding. The company produced the line of Boontonware dinnerware, molded plastic plates, bowls, and cups manufactured in the 1950s and 1960s. The company also operated a factory outlet store in Boonton for many years. George Scribner was eventually inducted into the Plastics Hall of Fame as a pioneer in developing molding techniques and applications at Boonton Molding Co. from 1920. He is considered a preeminent contributor to the development of the industry through his services as president and board chairman of the SPI during the period 1943–1947.

The molded plastics industry attracted the radio and electronics industries to the Boonton area. In the 1920s, the burgeoning radio industry created a large demand for molded parts. Richard W. Seabury organized Radio Frequency Laboratories to exploit that new field. More than a half dozen radio and electronics firms were later formed as spin-offs, and recognized internationally for the excellence of their products. Radio engineers had respect for the Boonton Radio Co., located in nearby Rockaway, which manufactured a high-quality test instrument known as a Q meter, still used by hobbyists today. Most of those companies have been bought up and are now divisions of larger corporations and have relocated elsewhere, having undergone name changes in many cases. The Boonton Radio Co., for instance, was purchased by Hewlett-Packard. RFL Industries, Aircraft Radio Corporation, Measurements Corporation, and Ballantine Laboratories are among those that contributed materially to the prosperity of the area.

In 1917, E.A. Stevenson &amp; Company established the &quot;Butter Works&quot; on the site of the old Knox Hat factory. Stevenson started processing coconut and other vegetable oils and making margarine. Under later operation by E.F. Drew &amp; Company, the Boonton plant grew to be one of the largest edible oils processors in the country. It was the largest industry in the town of Boonton during the 20th century. The plant closed in the early 1990s, and the site was developed for a Walmart store.

In recent years, Boonton has attracted several art galleries. Most of the galleries are located on the 800 block of Main Street, with a total of six galleries in the area surrounding Boonton Avenue and Main Street. This is often referred to as the Boonton Art District. The galleries hold an art walk showcasing gallery openings on the first Friday of each month.

===Local government===
Boonton operates using the town form of government. The town is one of nine municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this traditional form of government. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the Town Council. The governing body was previously called the Board of Aldermen, but in February 2021, the Board voted 7–2 to change the name to Town Council. The ordinance did not change the structure or function of municipal government. Members felt that the gendered “alderman” could dissuade women from running for office, and wanted to be more inclusive with the neutral “council member”. The mayor is elected at-large to a four-year term of office. The Town Council is comprised of eight members elected to serve two-year terms of office, with two Council Members elected from each of four wards on a staggered basis, with one seat from each of the four wards coming up for election each year.

, the Mayor of Boonton is Republican James Lynch, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2027. Members of the Town Council are Council President John Meehan (Ward 1; R, 2025), Daniel Ballan (Ward 3; R, 2026), Marie DeVenezia (Ward 2; D, 2026), Jacob W. Hettrich (Ward 2; D, 2025), Alexis Minson (Ward 4; R, 2025), Robert Murray (Ward 3; R, 2025), Benjamin Weisman (Ward 4; D, 2026) and Cy Wekilsky (Ward 1; R, 2026).

==Education==

As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of three schools, had an enrollment of 1,457 students and 132.8 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.0:1. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
School Street School with 258 students in grades Pre-K–2, 
John Hill School with 537 students in grades 3–8 and 
Boonton High School with 636 students in grades 9–12.

The district&#x27;s high school serves students from Boonton and also those from Lincoln Park, who attend as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Lincoln Park Public Schools, with Lincoln Park students accounting for a majority of students at the high school, including about 290 students as of the 2012–2013 school year. The two districts have sought to sever the more than 50-year-old relationship, citing cost savings that could be achieved by both districts and complaints by Lincoln Park that it is granted only one seat on the Boonton Public Schools&#x27; Board of Education. In April 2006, the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education rejected the request.

==Boonton Holmes Public Library==
The Boonton Holmes Public Library has been in operation since 1894. The building in which it resides was willed to the Town of Boonton by James Holmes for use as a public library. Holmes moved to Boonton in 1850 to take charge of the Taylor &amp; Lord Nail Factory. Holmes held several political posts in his life such as serving as Mayor of Boonton, on the State Board of Education, and on the Boonton Board of Education. Holmes used his wealth to improve the town, as when he donated the land and purchased the equipment to begin a firehouse in South Boonton. Holmes also started the first Boonton National Bank and served as its president.

The building itself dates much further back to when Eliza A. Scott purchased the corner lot in 1849 from the New Jersey Iron Company and built the first structure on the site in that same year. Holmes bought the property and two lots for $5,000 in 1856. He resided at his mansion house until his death in February 1893. Holmes bequeathed his house and lots to the Boonton Library Association which had incorporated in 1890. The gift included the mansion house, $5,000 for endowment purposes only, $2,000 for refitting the house as a library, and $1,000 for the purchase of books. The Library officially opened in 1894.

Since its opening, the library itself has only been on the first floor, and in later years the basement. The upper two floors have been used, at various times, as business space, a Masonic Hall, and most recently as three apartments. The basement also has been used commercially and has at one time housed the printing press for the Boonton Times newspaper. In 1895, Charles Grubb rented rooms in the Holmes Library and installed presses in the basement where on October 4, 1895, he published the first issue of &quot;The Boonton Times&quot; newspaper. In 1911, he moved to the corner of Main and Cornelia Streets.

The Boonton Holmes Public Library was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, on November 30, 1972.

<text>Boonton Township () is a township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 4,380, an increase of 117 (2.7%) from the 2010 census count of 4,263, which in turn reflected a decline of 24 (−0.6%) from 4,287 in the 2000 census.

Boonton Township was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 11, 1867, from portions of Pequannock Township. The borough of Mountain Lakes was formed from portions of the township on March 3, 1924. The settlement was originally called &quot;Boone-Towne&quot; in 1761 in honor of the Colonial Governor Thomas Boone.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Boonton Township as the 4th best place to live in the state in its rankings of the &quot;New Jersey&#x27;s Top Towns 2011–2012.

== History ==
Boonton Township&#x27;s recorded history began about 1710 when William Penn, the Quaker land speculator, located in the northern valley his Lot No. 48, which contained of fields and woodlands. James Bollen, whose bordering &quot;plantation&quot; stretching south toward the Tourne was described as &quot;situate on the fork of Rockaway with an Indian plantation in it,&quot; mapped his 1,507 acres (6 km2) in 1715. In 1765 David Ogden purchased from Burnet and Skinner the Great Boonton Tract. When the Township of Boonton was created as of April 11, 1867 by &quot;An Act to Divide the Township of Pequannoc in the County of Morris&quot; most of Penn&#x27;s Lot No. 48 and parts of the Bollen and Great Boonton Tracts fell within Boonton&#x27;s boundary.

The first settler of proper record was Frederick DeMouth of French Huguenot extraction. By 1758, his Rockaway Valley plantation within the Penn Lot covered , and it was on this land that the large Stickle, Bott and Kincaid farms were to prosper in the far distant future. Frederick Miller of German Palatine birth bought extensive land (later day Dixon acres) within the Bollen piece at 13 shillings per acre. These founding families were closely followed by the Hoplers, Van Winkles, Cooks, Scotts, Peers, Stickles and Kanouses.

McCaffrey Lane, the oldest recorded thoroughfare in the area, was built in 1767 by Samuel Ogden of the Great Boonton Tract. In 1822, North Main Street was &quot;cut&quot; along the proposed Morris Canal route. In 1824, the Morris Canal and Banking Company was chartered with John Scott of Powerville, an important commissioner. Locks number 9, 10 and 11 were constructed in newly named Powerville. 

The Powerville Hotel, still standing, was built near Lock Number 11 to accommodate both canal and transient trade. The hotel, owned by Nathan Hopkins, gained fame as a station on the pre-American Civil War Underground Railroad.

<text>Butler is a borough in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,047, an increase of 508 (+6.7%) from the 2010 census count of 7,539, which in turn reflected an increase of 119 (+1.6%) from the 7,420 counted in the 2000 census.

Butler was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 13, 1901, from portions of Pequannock Township.

==History==
The area now known as Butler was originally called &quot;West Bloomingdale&quot; and was sparsely populated. Water power brought manufacturing entities to the area. In 1857, The Pequannock Valley Paper Company moved from Bergen County and in 1868 the Newbrough Hard Rubber Company built a factory, both based along the Pequannock River. These were two significant economic entities that contributed to the growth of the borough. In 1871, the New Jersey Midland Railroad extended track through Butler from Paterson, making an important transportation connection for both passengers and freight. The northern terminus for the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s passenger service was located at Butler until 1966. The railroad still carries freight through Butler.

The growing community was given the name &quot;Butler&quot; in 1881 after Richard Butler, who had taken ownership of the Hard Rubber Company. A Post Office was established and a larger railroad station was built. This station has been the Borough Museum since 1977. The Hard Rubber Company eventually merged with other businesses and became the American Hard Rubber Company in 1898. A &quot;Soft&quot; Rubber Company built a factory just along Main Street. The borough continued to grow as other factories and supporting businesses were established. The population in 1920 was 2,265 people. By 1950, it was 4,063.

Butler&#x27;s largest fire began just after midnight, February 26, 1957, when one of the nation&#x27;s largest rubber reclaiming mills (Pequanoc Rubber Company on Main Street) was destroyed by a blaze estimated to have caused a loss of as much as $3 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The mill occupied the site on upper Main Street, an irregular shaped complex 600 feet by 300 feet and three to four stories high; it produced over 100 tons of reusable sheet rubber daily from 200 tons of scrap. One Butler Heights resident remembers the fire being so bright she could read a newspaper in her yard at 3 am at a distance of a mile. The glow reportedly was visible for 100 miles, mutual aid response was required by volunteer fire companies from a dozen nearby fire companies.

Numerous organizations exist in town and, along with the neighboring towns of Kinnelon and Bloomingdale, many &quot;Tri-Boro&quot; organizations serve the area, including the local Little League &amp; Volunteer First Aid Squad.

Butler was the location of a health resort run by Benedict Lust called &quot;Yungborn&quot; that opened on September 15, 1896.

<text>Chatham Borough is a suburban borough in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 9,212, an increase of 250 (+2.8%) from the 2010 census count of 8,962, which in turn reflected an increase of 502 (+5.9%) from the 8,460 counted in the 2000 census.

The area that is now Chatham has been inhabited by humans for thousands of years. During historic times, Europeans began trading with the Native Americans who farmed, fished, and hunted in the area when it was claimed as part of New Netherlands. The community that now is Chatham was first settled by Europeans in 1710 within Morris Township, in what was then the English Province of New Jersey. The community was settled because the site already was on the path of a well-worn Native American trail, the location of an important crossing of the Passaic River, and being close to a gap in the Watchung Mountains. The residents of the English community changed its name from John Day&#x27;s Bridge to Chatham, New Jersey in 1773.

Chatham&#x27;s residents were active participants in the American Revolutionary War, which ended in 1783. Chatham Township was formed as a local government in the new state of New Jersey on February 12, 1806, taking its name from this pre-revolutionary village. Initial local government forms were limited while the new state government evolved. The new township governed the village of Chatham that lay within the present-day borough boundaries, along with several other pre-revolutionary, colonial villages and large areas of unsettled lands connecting or adjacent to them. On August 19, 1892, Chatham adopted a new village form of government when it became allowed within townships in the state after the revolution. Shortly thereafter, once it was allowed, the village of Chatham reincorporated for governance as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 1, 1897, returning to complete independence from the surrounding Chatham Township.

An early railroad located along the Morris and Essex Lines that had become well established by the start of the Civil War as one of America&#x27;s first commuter railroads, had a stop at Chatham, which attracted many from nearby Manhattan, 20 miles to the east. It remains a commuter town for residents who work in New York City. Today, Chatham is a pedestrian-friendly community that covers less than , including a central business district and railroad station within approximately from its farthest boundary. The borough is situated in southeastern Morris County bordering both Essex and Union counties along the Passaic River. Northeast of the borough is the upscale Mall at Short Hills located in the Short Hills section of Millburn.

In July 2005, CNN/Money and &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Chatham ninth on its annual list of the 100 Best Places to Live in the United States. &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Chatham as its 25th best place to live in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey. In 2012, Forbes.com listed Chatham as 375th in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes&quot;, with a median home price of $776,703.

The borough has been ranked as one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. In March 2018, Bloomberg ranked Chatham as the 64th highest-income place in the United States and as having the 8th-highest income in New Jersey. In the 2013–2017 American Community Survey (ACS) the borough had a median household income of $163,026, ranking 16th in the state. The 2014–2018 ACS showed a median household income of $169,524 in the borough versus $111,316 in the county and $79,363 statewide. The most-recent (2021) ACS places the median household income of Chatham Borough at $209,283.

==History==
Occupied for thousands of years by Native Americans, this land was overseen by clans of the Minsi and Lenni Lenape, who farmed, fished, and hunted upon it. They were organized into a matrilineal, agricultural, and mobile hunting society sustained with fixed, but not permanent, settlements in their clan territories. Villages were established and relocated as the clans farmed new sections of the land when soil fertility lessened and moved among their fishing and hunting grounds.

In 1498, John Cabot explored this portion of the New World. The area was claimed as a part of the Dutch New Netherland province, where active trading in furs took advantage of the natural pass west, but, the Lenape prevented permanent settlement beyond what is now Jersey City. Although rapid exhaustion of the local beaver population soon turned the Dutch interests much farther north, contention existed between the Dutch and the British over the rights to this land and battles ensued. Passing to the rule of the British as the Province of New Jersey upon the fall of New Amsterdam in 1664, and becoming one of its original thirteen colonies, marks the beginning of permanent European settlements on this land.

The land that would become Chatham was part of the Province of East Jersey; the Indian rights to Chatham were purchased in 1680 from members of the Minsi and Lenni Lenape tribes. They spoke an Algonquian language. They hunted and fished in the area and farmed on the lands of their settlements. The area was well connected with established paths among their settlements, to and from bountiful resources, and to neighboring settlements. Safe passageways through the valleys, marshes, swamps, and mountains of this portion of the Watchung Mountains connected the area that would become Chatham with other settlements in the area. Except for highways built since the 1970s and a shunpike built to avoid tolls on the roads connecting the colonial settlements of Chatham and Bottle Hill, the roads of the area follow those time proven, long trodden trails made by the native tribes. Main Street rises from a shallow crossing of the Passaic River and, after traveling through what became the settlements of Chatham and Bottle Hill (which became Madison), the road follows a westward path that leads to the top of the plateau on which Morristown was founded.

In 1680, the British first purchased this Lenape land upon which John Day made the first European settlement in 1710. He chose to settle upon the western bank of the Fishawack Crossing (of the Passaic River) on the traditional Lenape Minisink Trail. Chatham was in the area delineated as Morris Township by the English. The landing at that location was the best place to ford the river and always had been used by the Lenape on their route to the Hudson River and south from their hunting grounds in what is now Sussex County. That traditional part of the Great Trail would become today’s Route 124, leading to Madison, Morristown, Mendham, and Chester. It became known as Main Street in Chatham.
Before long, the village became known as John Day&#x27;s Bridge because of a bridge he built across the river at the shallow landing. By 1750, the village had a blacksmith shop as well as a flour mill, a grist mill, and a lumber mill.

In 1773, the village was renamed to &quot;Chatham&quot; to honor a member of the British Parliament, William Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham, who was an outspoken advocate of the rights of the colonists in America.

New Jersey was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolutionary War. The was passed on July 2, 1776, two days before the Second Continental Congress declared American Independence from Great Britain. It was an act of the New Jersey Provincial Congress, which made itself into the state legislature. To reassure neutrals, it provided that it would become void if the state of New Jersey reached reconciliation with Great Britain.

The citizens of Chatham were active participants in the Revolutionary War and nearby Morristown became the military center of the revolution. George Washington twice established his winter headquarters in Morristown and revolutionary troops were active regularly in the entire area. The Lenape assisted the colonists, supplying the revolutionary army with warriors and scouts in exchange for food supplies and the promise of a role at the head of a future Native American state. The Treaty of Easton signed by the Lenape and the British in 1766 had required that the Lenape move to Pennsylvania. Wanting to recoup rights lost thereby to the British, the Lenape were the first tribe to enter into a treaty with the emerging government of the United States. In 1781, General Rochambeau built a large bakery operation at Chatham as a subterfuge that could be interpreted as his plan to stay in Chatham for an extended amount of time, in order to distract from the fact that his troops were marching south toward Yorktown.
The Watchung mountain range was a strategic asset in the war, acting as a natural barrier to the British troops and providing a vantage point for Washington to monitor their troop movements. The Minisink Trail and the village bridge provided a route for essential supplies across the river and through the mountain range. The Hobart Gap was vital as the only pass through the Watchung Mountains.

Washington wrote 17 letters while he stayed at a homestead in Chatham. The community was the site of several skirmishes, as residents and the rebel army held off British advances, preventing them from attacking Washington&#x27;s supplies at Morristown.

In 1779, a printing press was established in the village of Chatham by Shepard Kollock. From his workshop, he published books, pamphlets, and the &quot;New Jersey Journal&quot; (the third newspaper published in New Jersey) conducting lively debates about the efforts for independence and boosting the morale of the troops and their families with information derived directly from Washington&#x27;s headquarters in nearby Morristown. Kollock&#x27;s newspaper was published until 1992 as the &quot;Elizabeth Daily Journal&quot; (having relocated to there in 1787) and was the fourth oldest newspaper published continuously in the United States.

After the Revolutionary War was over in 1783, establishment of new forms of government began. On February 12, 1806, the village of Chatham became part of Chatham Township with a township form of government that shared the village&#x27;s name and included several other area communities and a large amount of unsettled land. However, &quot;[i]n 1892 Chatham Village found itself at odds with the rest of the township. Although village residents paid 40 percent of the township taxes, they got only 7 percent of the receipts in services. The village had to raise its own money to install kerosene street lamps and its roads were in poor repair. As a result, the village voted on August 9, 1892, to secede from governance by the township.&quot;

Ten days later, on August 19, 1892, the citizens of Chatham reincorporated with another type of village government then offered as an alternative within townships by the new state. The evolving state regulations regarding governance structure soon began to offer a borough form for governance. Chatham adopted that new government form and the village reincorporated for governance as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 1, 1897, with complete independence from Chatham Township.

Most of the colonial settlements that had been part of Chatham Township abandoned its governance as soon as new forms of government became available to them during this evolution of new state regulations. Green Village being the exception, each of the settlements withdrew from governance by the township and Chatham Township was left to govern mostly unsettled lands.

In 1910, the borough boundaries expanded when Chatham acquired a slice of Florham Park. The local form of government and the boundaries of the borough have remained the same since that acquisition, encompassing about .

==Architecture==

At in area, Chatham was mostly built out well before World War II, retaining homes that sometimes display the dates of their construction during the colonial and revolutionary times. Two houses, now privately owned, survive from colonial times; the Paul Day House, at 24 Kings Road, and the Nathaniel Bonnell House, at 34 Watchung Avenue.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.38 square miles (6.17 km2), including 2.35 square miles (6.08 km2) of land and 0.04 square miles (0.09 km2) of water (1.51%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Stanley.

The borough is located west of New York City on the eastern edge of Morris County. Chatham&#x27;s neighboring communities are Summit to the southeast located in Union County, Millburn (and its Short Hills neighborhood) in Essex County to the northeast, while communities also located in Morris County include Chatham Township to the west, and Madison and Florham Park to the north.

The Passaic River, which rises at Millington Gorge in Long Hill Township and defines the Great Swamp, flows north along the eastern boundary of Chatham. A good crossing location, identified by Native Americans to early European settlers, figured significantly in the colonial history of the community. Fairmount Avenue ascends Long Hill perpendicularly from Main Street in the contemporary center of town to the highest elevation of the town among the Watchung Mountains. From there, one may see the lights of New York beyond the crest of the ridge hills of Summit and Short Hills. Water from artesian wells is stored at its crest to provide the drinking water for the community.

A portion of the Great Swamp extends to the southern boundary of Chatham and other marshes surround the community to the north and northwest. The marshes and brooks in the area contain water draining from the plateau of Morristown and many points to the north and west. All are remnants of a massive lake that covered the area following the retreat of the Wisconsin glacier of the last Ice age. Residents of Chatham were among those in late 1959 who formed the Jersey Jetport Site Association and instigated preservation of the Great Swamp when the New York Port Authority sought to turn it into a massive regional airport. They later were joined by the North American Wildlife Foundation that completed acquisition of enough of the Great Swamp to protect the massive natural resource as a federal park.

The Great Swamp is a major watershed and a significant resting point for migratory birds. The core of the swamp was purchased with the help of Geraldine R. Dodge and Marcellus Hartley Dodge Sr. Several other members of the Jersey Jetport Site Association, including two residents of Chatham, Kafi Benz and Esty Weiss, who were students at the nearby campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University, began to infiltrate meetings of the administration of Austin Joseph Tobin, the executive director of the Port Authority. They attended meetings scheduled quietly to garner the support of union workers. Once inside the meetings, they provided pamphlets in opposition to the project, which infuriated the Port Authority administration. Eventually, other organizations formed to join the opposition to the plans for the airport and finally, a majority of the swamp was assembled to be donated to the federal government to become a National Wildlife Refuge. Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior under President John F. Kennedy, lent his support to the local efforts to save the swamp while he served as U.S. Representative from Arizona, making recommendations to the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration to also lend their support. On November 3, 1960, the legislation creating the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was passed by an act of the United States Congress.

Just northeast of the borough is the upscale Mall at Short Hills located in the Short Hills section of Millburn.

==Economy==
Now headquartered in Morris Plains, Weichert, Realtors was established by Jim Weichert in 1969 with an office in Chatham Borough. The borough is home to Chatham Asset Management, a hedge fund holding a controlling interest in several large media companies.

==Government==
From 1614, the area was governed by the Dutch as part of New Netherland. In 1664, it came under governance by the British within the Province of New Jersey, during which a permanent European settlement was established in 1710 that changed its name to Chatham in 1773.

Chatham has adopted different forms of local government throughout its existence. Under British colonial rule, a village form of government was adopted. After the American Revolutionary War, the community became part of Chatham Township, which was founded by new state of New Jersey in 1806 as it was beginning to determine governmental forms. That township also included several other settlements and a great deal of unsettled lands. Unhappy with that governance, Chatham seceded from the township in 1892 and returned to a village government. When the borough form of government was offered by the state, Chatham adopted that form of government by a reincorporation in 1897, and that governmental form has been used ever since.

===Local government===

Having adopted several different forms of government since its settlement in 1710, Chatham adopted the newly allowed borough form of New Jersey municipal government during a reincorporation in 1897. The borough form of government is now used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Chatham is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the Mayor is Democrat Carolyn Dempsey, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the borough council are Council President Jocelyn Mathiasen (D, 2027), Brian Hargrove (D, 2026), Katherine Hay (D, 2027), Karen Koronkiewicz (D, 2025), Justin Strickland (D, 2026) and Irene Treloar (D, 2025).

===Shared services===

Along with Chatham Township, Harding Township, and Madison, the borough became a member of a joint municipal court that was created in 2010. The court is located in Madison.

==Fishawack Festival==
First celebrated in 1971, the Fishawack Festival is held in the beginning of summer, on South Passaic Avenue and Fire House Plaza, which are blocked off so up to 20,000 attendees may walk freely in the streets. Local vendors set up booths to sell food, clothing, toys, and various other souvenirs, as well as offering games and rides for children. The festival has been sponsored by the Madison YMCA, PipeWorks Services, and Klas Electrical. Funds generated from the Fishawack Festival go toward various community groups located in Chatham and Chatham Township.

The word &quot;Fishawack&quot; is derived from the Lenni Lenape name for the Passaic River. In a book about the derivation of the name for the festival, &quot;Chatham at the Crossing of the Fishawack&quot; by John T. Cunningham, the author noted, &quot;Fishawack was the Lenni Lenape Indian name for the Passaic River and Chatham was located at the narrowest part making it the &quot;Crossing of the Fishawack in the Valley of the Great Watchung&quot;... In 1971, a Chamber of Commerce sidewalk sale day, called Fishawack Day, was held. Thus began an event, which in time was adopted by Fishawack Inc., the governing body of volunteers who turned it into a big biennial town-wide Festival.&quot;.

==Education==

===Public schools===

The School District of the Chathams is a regional public school district serving students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade from Chatham and Chatham Township. The two municipalities held elections in November 1986 to consider joining their separate school districts. This proposal was supported by the voters of both communities and since then, the two municipalities have shared a regionalized school district. Starting with the 1988–1989 school year, Chatham High School was formed by merging the former Chatham Borough High School and Chatham Township High School facilities. The Chatham Borough High School building was repurposed as the Chatham Borough Hall.

As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of six schools, had an enrollment of 3,930 students and 342.8 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.5:1. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Milton Avenue School with 284 students in grades Pre-K–3, 
Southern Boulevard School with 414 students in grades K–3, 
Washington Avenue School with 314 students in grades K–3, 
Lafayette School with 592 students in grades 4–5, 
Chatham Middle School with 984 students in grades 6–8 and 
Chatham High School with 1,315 students in grades 9–12. The district board of education has nine members who set policy and oversee the fiscal and educational operation of the district through its administration; the seats on the board are allocated to the constituent municipalities based on population, with the borough assigned four seats.

For the 2004–2005 school year, Chatham High School was recognized with the National Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive. Milton Avenue School was one of 11 in the state to be recognized in 2014 by the United States Department of Education&#x27;s National Blue Ribbon Schools Program. The district high school was the first-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 2014 cover story on the state&#x27;s &quot;Top Public High Schools&quot;, using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked twentieth in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked eighth in 2010 out of 322 schools listed.

===Private schools===
Saint Patrick School, founded in 1872, serves students in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade, operating under the direction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Morris County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

New Jersey Route 24 is a multi-lane state freeway crossing the borough boundaries, though the nearest interchange is just outside the borough along the boundary of Summit and Millburn. New Jersey Route 124 is the main local road providing access to Chatham along the route that connected the area before the limited access highway was built. This local route wound its way through the area since before colonial times following the course of the Great Minisink Trail and had been designated as Route 24 until it was renumbered to Route 124 when the limited access highway was built in the late 1900s. The local communities chose to retain their historic character and opted out of plans for the multi-lane, limited access highway. The nearest interchanges with the new Route 24 are in neighboring communities, to the east it is Millburn and to the west it is Hanover Township.

In 1906, the borough received coverage from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Chatham Press&quot; for implementation of what may be the world&#x27;s first recorded use of a speed bump as a traffic calming device. A report from the April 24, 1906, issue of &quot;The Times&quot; described how &quot;[t]he &#x27;bumps&#x27; installed by the borough officials of the village of Chatham to check the speed of automobiles through the village had their first test yesterday, and proved a decided success.&quot;

===Public transportation===

NJ Transit stops at the Chatham station to provide commuter service on the Morristown Line, with trains heading to the Hoboken Terminal and to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan.

Direct bus service from Chatham to Manhattan is not provided by NJ Transit. It provides various route options with bus transfers. Local bus service is provided by NJ Transit on the 873 route to the Livingston Mall and Parsippany-Troy Hills, which replaced service that had been offered until 2010 on the MCM3 and MCM8 routes.

Bus lines also connect Chatham with the other towns along Route 24 from Newark to Morristown, mostly running parallel to the train lines. Nowadays, buses transport people along the line, but stagecoaches and trolleys were mass transit methods once used along the route that followed Main Street.

==Library==

Chatham Library was founded in 1907 in downtown Chatham after decades of discussion and planning. Growth of the collection brought about expansion and movement to progressively larger facilities until the current building was built on Main Street on the former site of the Fairview Hotel, after it had burned down. The hotel land was bought after a borough-wide solicitation of funds that was proposed by Charles M. Lum, after whose family Lum Avenue is named, and a brick building was constructed to house the library. The new Chatham Library was dedicated and opened to the public in 1924.

A referendum on the November 1974 ballot regarding jointure was approved by voters, providing that the Chatham Library also would serve Chatham Township residents. The library was renamed as the Library of The Chathams, which now is administered by six trustees, who are appointed jointly through the two governments via the mayors of the two municipalities or their representatives, as well as a representative from the newly created joint School District of the Chathams.

In 1985, the library joined the &quot;Morris Automated Information Network&quot; (MAIN), an electronic database created to link together all of the public libraries in Morris County. Expansion of the library with an addition costing nearly $4,000,000 was planned with the governments of the two municipalities contributing a combined $2,000,000. The project was completed and the new addition dedicated on January 11, 2004.

<text>Chatham Township is a suburban township located in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 10,983, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 531 (+5.1%) from the 10,452 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 366 (+3.6%) from the 10,086 counted in the 2000 census. The long-established hamlet of Green Village (also within Harding Township) is located in Chatham Township.

The presence of the Chatham station along the Morris and Essex Lines in neighboring Chatham Borough proved a vital role in population increases in Chatham Township, which began to be developed for residential use due to its easy commute to nearby Manhattan.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Chatham Township first in the state in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; in New Jersey.

The township has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the 2013–2017 American Community Survey, township residents had a median household income of $176,364, ranked 3rd in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475. In March 2018, Bloomberg ranked Chatham as the 64th highest-income place in the United States and as having the 8th-highest income in New Jersey.

In 2012, Forbes.com listed Chatham as 375th in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes&quot;, with a median home price of $776,703.

==History==

===Formation===
Chatham Township was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 12, 1806, from portions of Hanover Township and Morris Township. At the time Chatham Township was created, it included the communities of Chatham, Green Village and Bottle Hill (Madison), together with the extensive rural areas surrounding these communities, with each community retaining its own distinct existence and identity. Before the close of that century however, the township would lose all except one of the settlements under its jurisdiction, as they seceded from the township and established their own municipal governments.

The community known as &quot;Bottle Hill&quot; was established in the early eighteenth century in Morris Township when the area was within the English Province of New Jersey. Bottle Hill changed its name to Madison in 1834 to honor President James Madison. On December 27, 1889, Madison was incorporated as an independent borough and its former village boundaries were expanded between 1891 - 1899 with annexed portions of rural lands that had formerly been within the township.

The settlement of Chatham had been established in 1710 as &quot;John Day&#x27;s Bridge&quot; and, in 1773 when New Jersey was an English province, adopted the name of &quot;Chatham&quot; to honor William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, a British supporter of the colonial cause. This village also had been within Morris Township and it was an active community in the Revolutionary War. On August 19, 1892, Chatham seceded from the new township that had taken its name and adopted the village form of government established in the United States for the new state of New Jersey. Shortly thereafter, Chatham adopted the borough form of government on March 1, 1897.

Florham Park was formed from portions of the township on March 20, 1899.

Most of Green Village has always been within the township&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In 1773, the village &quot;John Day&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, a community governed by the English township of Morris since its settlement in 1710, was renamed as, &quot;Chatham&quot;, in honor of Sir William Pitt, a British prime minister and the first Earl of Chatham, who was most favorable toward the colonists of the Province of New Jersey in issues with the British government. Participation in the Revolutionary War was significant by the residents of Chatham. Nearby Morristown was the military center of the revolution, where the winter headquarters were established twice, and revolutionary troops were active in the entire area regularly.

The township form of government is the oldest form of municipal government in the state of New Jersey following the revolution. That form of local government dates back to New Jersey&#x27;s Township Act of 1798. Chatham Township was formed on February 12, 1806, with jurisdiction over the area of present-day Chatham Borough several communities and settlements, including some that had been part of Hanover and Morris Townships. A great deal of open, swampy, and mountainous land was included with the hamlets.

For a while, the new township included what are now Madison, Chatham Borough and Florham Park, as well as all of Green Village and all of the lands still governed by Chatham Township, but over time these settlements began to secede because of contention over insufficient funding of their projects. Disposition of funds from taxes was perceived as inequitable to the settled areas given their needs versus that of the rural areas, causing them to form their own taxation and governance systems.

Of the pre-revolutionary settlements included in its jurisdiction when it was formed, only portions of Green Village have remained governed by Chatham Township, which has never had a community center.

On December 27, 1889, based on the results of a referendum passed three days earlier, the village of Madison seceded from Chatham Township and adopted the borough form of government in order to develop a local water supply system for its population of 3,250. Madison annexed additional portions of Chatham Township in 1891, and annexed more each year from 1894 to 1898, followed finally, by an exchange of some lands in 1899 with Chatham Township.

In the midst of these changes, in 1892 &quot;...Chatham Village found itself at odds with the rest of the township. Although village residents paid 40 percent of the township taxes, they got only 7 percent of the receipts in services. The village had to raise its own money to install kerosene street lamps and its roads were in poor repair. As a result, the village voted on August 9, 1892, to secede from the township.&quot;

The municipality that is now Florham Park was originally part of Hanover Township, before being included in the township formed in 1806 as Chatham Township. When it seceded from Chatham Township, it incorporated as a borough as Florham Park on March 20, 1899.

The boundaries of Chatham Township have remained unchanged since 1899.

Post-World War II suburban development ensued in the 1950s when farm lands, greenhouses, and flower nurseries began to be sold off. Families moved out to this rural suburban area as ownership of automobiles increased dramatically.
The township experienced even more extensive residential development, starting with the 1960s and 1970s, when rezoning enabled residential development of the open spaces and several farms and woodlands were sold off to developers. For several generations, the largest, the Schwartz Farm had produced dairy products that were sold in local stores and schools and that were delivered to homes on scheduled routes. Former rose farms became two major shopping centers near the corner of Shunpike Road and Southern Boulevard. The corner was known as Hickory Tree, named for a hickory tree planted during President Madison&#x27;s term.

Heyl Roses in Green Village was the last and oldest commercial rose and cut flower grower in New Jersey, until its closure in 1999.

After successfully crossing the Delaware River and subsequent battles in Trenton and Princeton, General Washington marched to Morristown and established his headquarters in Arnold&#x27;s Tavern on the Morristown Green for the Continental Army’s first winter encampment. Most of the army was sent a few miles southeast to the Lowantica Valley (modern spelling Loantaka) in Chatham Township, at a site located north of Loantaka Brook, East of Tredwell Avenue and West of Giralda Farms. In 2016, the Morris County Park Commission and the Chatham Township Historical Society began working together to reclaim the area and create trails and apply for grants for informational signage.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 9.35 square miles (24.22 km2), including 9.08 square miles (23.51 km2) of land and 0.27 square miles (0.70 km2) of water (2.91%).

Chatham Township is located about west of New York City on the eastern edge of Morris County. Chatham Township&#x27;s neighboring municipalities to the south are Summit, New Providence, and Berkeley Heights in Union County. Long Hill Township and Harding Township (and its New Vernon section) to the west, Madison to the north, and Chatham Borough to the east all of which lie within Morris County.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Floral Hill, Great Swamp, Green Village (partially in Harding Township), Hickory Tree, Mount Vernon and The Orchard.

Green Village is the site of the Rolling Knolls Landfill, a landfill identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a Superfund site. The landfill is bordered on two sides by the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, and was formerly known as Miele&#x27;s Dump, after owner Robert Miele. In operation from the 1930s until the late 1960s, the landfill accepted a wide variety of waste material from municipal and industrial sources, including residential septage and pharmaceutical materials. In 2010, the township designated the site as a redevelopment zone, with the possibility that the area could be remediated as a solar farm.

<text>Chester Borough is a borough in southwestern Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,681, an increase of 32 (+1.9%) from the 2010 census count of 1,649, which in turn reflected an increase of 14 (+0.9%) from the 1,635 counted in the 2000 census. Chester&#x27;s name is derived from the township, which was named for Chestershire in England.

Chester Borough is located within the Raritan Valley region and is periodically recognized as part of the Somerset Hills. The borough is completely surrounded by Chester Township, making it part of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.

In the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s rankings of the &quot;Most Expensive ZIP Codes in the United States&quot;, Chester was ranked 288th in 2006 (with a median sale price of $775,000) and 321st in 2010 (with a median price of $823,691).

==Government==

===Local government===
Chester is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Chester is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Chester is Republican Janet G. Hoven, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Chester Borough Council are Karen L. Ferrone (R, 2025), Russell Goodwin (R, 2025), Elizabeth Gugliemini (R, 2023), Christopher K. Heil (R, 2024), Kyle J. Holman (R, 2024) and Gary W. Marshuetz (R, 2023).

===Merger discussion with Chester Township===
In 2007, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine created incentives for small towns of less than 10,000 inhabitants to combine with other cities. The goal was to reduce the overall cost of government and thereby offer some tax relief. &quot;New Jersey has 21 counties, 566 municipalities and 616 school districts, and property taxes average $6,800 per homeowner, or twice the national average.&quot;

Chester Borough had originally split from Chester Township in 1930 over the creation of sewer and water infrastructure in the more densely settled center of the municipality. The residents of the rural portions of the Township did not wish to financially support the construction and maintenance of a public sewer or water utility. Since that time rural Chester Township has relied upon individual private wells for water and septic systems for wastewater treatment while the borough is primarily, although not entirely, served by public sewer and water. Concerns over the extension of utilities into the rural Township with the resultant potential for large scale growth served as an impediment to consolidation. The prohibition of utility extensions supported by the New Jersey state plan and codified in the Highlands Water Protection Act, along with the development restrictions contained in the Highlands Act have lessened those concerns. Additionally, an aggressive land conservation program in the Township has resulted in over 40% of the Township being placed into permanent preservation, further lessening worries about potential overdevelopment. The two municipalities currently share a common K–8 school district, volunteer fire department, library, first aid squad and other municipal services. Some residents are concerned about the unknown costs of a merger and a disproportionate allocation of those costs.

The two mayors had publicly endorsed a cost–benefit analysis of a merger. As two previous efforts had failed, the two municipalities have taken and deliberate approach to determine the savings, if any.

A merger vote planned for November 2010 was delayed for at least a year after Governor Christie&#x27;s elimination of equalization funds that would ensure some taxpayers do not pay more due to the merger, as an analysis by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs estimated that township residents would see an annual increase of $128 on their property taxes while those in the borough would see an average decline of $570 in their taxes.

===Federal, state and county representation===

<text>Chester Township is a township in southwestern Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 7,713, a decrease of 125 (−1.6%) from the 2010 census count of 7,838, which in turn reflected an increase of 556 (+7.6%) from the 7,282 counted in the 2000 census. The township&#x27;s name is derived from Chestershire in England.

Periodically recognized as part of the Somerset Hills, Chester Township is located in the Raritan Valley region within the New York Metropolitan area. It is known as the &quot;doughnut&quot; around Chester Borough since it completely surrounds it, making it part of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.

Located about west of New York City, Chester Township is a semi-rural residential community known for its agricultural and equestrian farms along with its country estates. The township is characterized by undeveloped, residentially zoned areas that largely contain vast amounts of open space comprised of farmland — much of which is preserved — in addition to public parks.

The township has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the 2014–2018 American Community Survey, the township residents had a median household income of $160,625, more than double the statewide median of $79,363. In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Chester Township at 321st in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes,&quot; with a median home price of $823,691.

==History==
The earliest records of individuals settling in the area date back to deeds dated in 1713, for properties located near a point where two Lenape Native American trails crossed at an area called Black River. With the arrival of the Rogerenes in 1730, the area developed as an agricultural community, producing applejack, flax and wool, as well as raising cattle. The Township was created from portions of Roxbury Township and Washington Township on April 1, 1799, following a local referendum. A burst of economic activity occurred starting in 1875 with the discovery of iron ore in the area, which led to the construction of dozens of mines, a blast furnace and many of the commercial and residential structures in the township date to that era. The discovery of far more abundant and productive mining sites in Minnesota&#x27;s Mesabi Range ended that boom after nearly 15 years. Chester returned to its farming roots in the 20th Century.

It was established by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 1, 1799, from portions of both Roxbury and Washington Townships, based on the results of a referendum held that day. Additional territories were acquired from Randolph Township (in 1806) and Washington Township (1840 and 1853). Portions of the township were taken on April 3, 1930, to form Chester Borough, a separate municipality surrounded entirely by Chester Township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 29.22 square miles (75.67 km2), including 29.13 square miles (75.45 km2) of land and 0.09 square miles (0.22 km2) of water (0.29%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Hacklebarney, Horton, Milldale, Milltown, Mount Paul, Pleasant Hill and Upper Ironia.

The township completely surrounds Chester Borough, making it part of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another. The township borders Mendham Township to the east, Randolph and Roxbury to the northeast, Mount Olive to the northwest, and Washington Township to the west, all of which are located in Morris County, while the Somerset County municipalities of Bedminster and Peapack-Gladstone, located in the Somerset Hills lie to the south and Tewksbury Township in Hunterdon County to the southwest.

==Parks and recreation==

Of the township&#x27;s , 42%, or about , is permanently protected from development. There are nature reserves and parkland, but also agricultural property that is deed restricted under the state Farmland Preservation Program, which buys the development rights while allowing the farmer to retain title and continue working the land. Chester has been described as a rural environment that caters to &quot;agritourism.&quot; The township has developed this reputation by preserving farmland through public investment in open spaces.

The township&#x27;s parks and preserves are free and open to the public. Parks include:
* Chubb Park: An area with playing fields, skating, ponds, and sledding.
* Tiger Brook Park: Purchased with the assistance of the New Jersey Green Acres Program in 1980, this preserve contains a reservoir.
* Hacklebarney State Park: This park was established in 1924 with the donation of . The Black River, which bisects the park, is one of the premier trout fishing streams in New Jersey.
* Black River Fish and Wildlife Management Area: This area consists of in the northern portion of the Township. It was purchased under the Green Acres Acquisition Program for recreational activities, including fishing, hunting, canoeing, cross-country skiing and hiking.
* Highlands Ridge Park: Former Bell Laboratories Outdoor Research Lab. Site of the &#x27;Telephone Pole Farm&#x27; and current headquarters of the New Jersey Highlands Council, a 15-member appointed body tasked with implementation of the New Jersey Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act of 2004.

Development is highly constrained due to state and township ordinances. The entire township is located in the New Jersey Highlands with approximately 86% of the land area designated as part of the more highly constrained Highlands Preservation Area. This environmentally sensitive area supplies drinking water to two-thirds of the state&#x27;s residents. In 2004, the state passed the Highlands Preservation Act to limit development. In 2005, 27 new homes were built and 16 in 2006.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===
In 1958, Chester Township changed its form of government from the Township form to a Faulkner Act form, Small Municipality, Plan C. The township is one of 18 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government, which is available to municipalities with fewer than 12,000 residents at the time of adoption. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and four councilmembers, all elected at-large for three-year terms on a staggered basis as part of the November general election, with two seats coming up for election in consecutive years followed by the mayoral seat in the third year of the cycle. The candidates run on a partisan basis at regular primary and general election times. Independent candidates, having declared their intentions at primary time, run only in the general election.

Chester Township&#x27;s form of government features a strong mayor, who acts as the township&#x27;s executive, overseeing the creation of a budget, preparing an annual financial report and the enforcement of state and local laws, and is responsible for hiring most township officials (with approval of the Council). The Council, which is the township&#x27;s legislative body, selects one of its members to serve as president to preside when the mayor is not present. The mayor participates and votes in Council sessions and makes committee assignments to Councilmembers. The mayor and a member of the Council serve on the Planning Board.

, the Mayor of Chester Township is Republican Timothy Drag Members of the Chester Township Council are John Butkus (R, 2024), Joseph DiPaolo (R, 2023), Tara Schellhorn (R, 2023), and Timothy Russell (R, 2024).

==== Merger discussion with Chester Borough ====
In 2007, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine created incentives for municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants to combine with other communities. The goal was to reduce the overall cost of government and thereby offer some tax relief. &quot;New Jersey has 21 counties, 566 municipalities and 616 school districts, and property taxes average $6,800 per homeowner, or twice the national average.&quot;

Chester Borough split from Chester Township in 1930 over the creation of sewer and water infrastructure in the more densely settled center of the municipality. The residents of the rural portions of the Township did not wish to financially support the construction and maintenance of a public sewer or water utility. Since that time rural Chester Township has relied upon individual private wells for water and septic systems for wastewater treatment while the Borough is primarily, although not entirely, served by public sewer and water. Concerns over the extension of utilities into the more rural Township with the resultant potential for large scale growth served as an impediment to consolidation. The prohibition of utility extensions supported by the NJ State Plan and codified in the Highlands Water Protection Act, along with the development restrictions contained in the Highlands Act have lessened those concerns. Additionally, an aggressive land conservation program in the Township has resulted in over 40% of the Township being placed into permanent preservation, further lessening worries about potential overdevelopment. The two municipalities currently share a common K–8 school district, volunteer fire department, library, first aid squad and other municipal services.

Governor Corzine&#x27;s plan to reduce or eliminate state aid had residents considering recombining towns. The two mayors publicly endorsed a cost/benefit analysis of a merger. However, a merger vote planned for November 2, 2010, was delayed until 2011 due to Governor Christie&#x27;s elimination of equalization funds that would ensure some taxpayers do not pay more due to the merger, as an analysis by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs estimated that township residents would see an annual increase of $128 on their property taxes while those in the borough would see an average decline of $570 in their taxes.

=== Federal, state and county representation ===
Chester Township is located in the 7th Congressional District and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s 24th state legislative district.

<text>Denville Township is a township in Morris County, in the northern portion of the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a commuter town of New York City in the New York metropolitan area, located west of Manhattan. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 17,107, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 472 (+2.8%) from the 2010 census count of 16,635, which in turn had reflected an increase of 811 (+5.1%) from the 15,824 counted at the 2000 census.
Located at the center of the county, Denville&#x27;s access to major transportation routes has made it known as the &quot;Hub of Morris County&quot;. The township&#x27;s location in Morris County has contributed to the growth of its &quot;eclectic downtown&quot;, along with four membership lake communities developed a century ago as summer colonies.

NJ Transit rail service is available at the Denville station, a large three-platform station serving both the Morristown and the Montclair-Boonton train lines, with service to Hoboken Terminal or to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan via Midtown Direct.

Denville was formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 14, 1913, from portions of Rockaway Township.

== History ==
Lenape Native Americans were known to travel the Minisink Trail for centuries before Europeans arrived in New Jersey. Part of that trail cut across what is now southern Denville, roughly following the course of Route 10 and Mount Pleasant Turnpike. Some research has indicated that there was a Lenape campsite along the trail in Denville, on or near the Ayres / Knuth Farm Historic Site along Route 10.

When Dutch and English settlers began to arrive in the new world in the early 17th century, the Minisink Trail was the likely route they traveled to explore the interior. Daniel Denton, one of the purchasers of what is known as the Elizabethtown Tract in 1664, led an expedition into the interior of northern New Jersey. In 1670, he wrote the first English language description of the area. Some researchers conclude that the name &quot;Denville&quot; derives from Denton.

Some researchers have suggested that European settlers began to come to the Denville area as early as 1690. These early settlers were primarily Dutch and English from Long Island, Quakers from Philadelphia, and Germans. William Penn and several other proprietors began to survey and stake out lands in the Denville area around 1715. These surveys are the first documentation of Denville. Between 1730 and 1760, several forges and mills were erected in Denville along the Rockaway River and the Denbrook. A number of communities associated with the forges and mills began to emerge. Ninkey and Franklin in southern Denville developed around the forges there of the same names. Denville village developed around the Job Allen Iron Works. Early developers of Denville, such as the Hussa family and A.B Crane &amp; Co., were intrinsic in shaping the residential and lake communities.

An alternative explanation for the derivation of the township&#x27;s name came from a letter from early Denville settler John Hinchman in the year 1800, in which he recounted some of the oral history of Denville from 50 years earlier, as stated to him by some of the elders of the time. Hinchman explains in his letter that the naming of Denville can be traced to a &quot;den&quot; of wild animals located in the swampy regions along the Denbrook and Rockaway River. The animals would bask on a knoll that juts out into the meadows where they were hunted by the native Lenape. This &quot;den&quot;, Hinchman wrote, was the basis for the name of Denville and the Denbrook.
