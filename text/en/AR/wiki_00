<text>Perryville () is a home rule-class city along the Chaplin River in western Boyle County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 751 at the time of the 2010 U.S. Census. It is part of the Danville Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The site was first settled by James Harbeson and a band of Virginians in the final stages of the American Revolution . Harbeson&#x27;s Fort or Station was located near a cave and spring to provide additional protection from Indian raids. The settlement&#x27;s position beside the river and along roads leading to Harrod&#x27;s Fort, Louisville, Lebanon, and Danville caused it to be renamed Harbeson&#x27;s Crossing.

In 1815, Edward Bullock and William Hall laid out a new town at the site named for Cmdr. Oliver Hazard Perry, the hero of the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812. Bullock started the post office the next year and the state legislature incorporated the city in 1817.
 In the late 1830s, a line of buildings next to the Chaplin River formed the basis of the village of Perryville. Now called &quot;Merchants&#x27; Row,&quot; these buildings still stand.

The early nineteenth century revived interest in classical education for the small town. Many institutions of higher learning, mostly all-women&#x27;s colleges, were established, including the Ewing Institute, the Elmwood Academy, and Harmonia College. One of Harmonia College&#x27;s graduates achieved national prominence Carrie Nation, the national temperance leader, boarded at the Karrick-Parks house while living in Perryville. As Nation &quot;cleaned out&quot; a number of local spots, it is believed that Perryville became the first location in the United States to exercise Local Option laws.

In October 1862, the fields west of town were the site of the Battle of Perryville, an important encounter in the American Civil War that ended the Kentucky Campaign of Confederate generals Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith. The Perryville Battlefield is preserved as a state park, and is the site of a reenactment of the battle every year.

In 1961, Perryville and the surrounding area was made part of a National Historic Landmark area. In 1973, the entire town of Perryville, because of the contribution the village has made toward American history, was put on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Jackson is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Breathitt County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 2,231 according to the 2010 U.S. census.

It was the home of the Jackson Academy, which became Lees College.

==History==
Upon the creation of Breathitt County in 1839, local landowner Simon Cockrell Sr. donated to serve as its seat of government. The community was originally known as Breathitt, Breathitt Town, or Breathitt Court House after the county, but upon its incorporation as a city by the state legislature in 1843, it was renamed Jackson to honor former president Andrew Jackson.

Local feuds led the national press to publish stories about Jackson and &quot;Bloody Breathitt&quot;: state troops were dispatched twice in the 1870s and again in 1903 after the assassination of U.S. Commissioner James B. Marcum on the courthouse steps to restore order.

The Kentucky Union Railroad reached the city in 1891, and Jackson boomed until the L&amp;N continued the line on to Hazard in 1912. A fire on Halloween, 1913, burned down much of the town.

==Geography==
Jackson is located at (37.553012, −83.388249). The city is nestled in the heart of the Cumberland Plateau of the Appalachian Mountains, with the downtown located on the north bank of the North Fork of the Kentucky River. To limit flooding, the Kentucky River was redirected in 1963 by way of a small cut-through through the mountain, and its former channel, a river meander, was left behind as Panbowl Lake, now a prime attraction for fishermen.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Jackson has a total area of , of which is land and , or 6.11%, is water.

On average, there are 17 days where temperatures remain at or below freezing and 15 days with highs at or above per year. In addition, although the area falls under USDA hardiness zone 6b, the record longest streak without lows occurred from February 6, 1996, to January 15, 2009 (). The highest recorded temperature was on June 29, 2012, and the lowest recorded temperature was on January 19, 1994, and January 20 and 21, 1985.

Precipitation averages annually, falling on an average 144 days, and the wettest month by normal rainfall is May. Normal winter snowfall is , though, as is typical in areas in the humid subtropical zone, snow cover does not remain for long, as there is an average of only 18 days with at least of snow cover.

==Transportation==

===Kentucky Routes within the city===
* The highway goes north to Campton and the Mountain Parkway and south to Hazard and the Hal Rogers Parkway. It is the main artery into the city and, currently, it is being relocated and changed to four lanes around and inside the city. It has been locally named (within the county) as the Breathitt County Veterans Highway.
* The highway goes east to Salyersville and west to Booneville. It merges with KY 15 (at the present time) throughout most of the city. The west end is known, locally, as &quot;Booneville Road&quot;.
* The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus starts in the city of Jackson at the intersection with KY 30 and heads west towards Beattyville. It is locally known as &quot;Beattyville Road&quot;.
* The highway goes north to the Mountain Parkway by way of Lee City in Wolfe County and eventually to West Liberty in Morgan County. The highway&#x27;s southern terminus starts at the intersection of KY 15. Recently, an old section of KY 15 was annexed to the highway, and it is possible, once more of the re-routed KY 15 is finished, that it could annex more of the old KY 15 sections.
* -&quot;Not a Primary State Highway&quot; – The highway goes north to Campton and south to intersect and end near the KY 15 and KY 30 junction in Jackson. In the north, it connects with KY 205 and follows it until it intersects with the new section of KY 15; it follows KY 15 for a mile and then splits only to intersects KY 15 in Jackson once more; it then breaks away only to connect (partially) with Main Street and then heads south. It is part of what was once the original KY 15 when it was built in 1925. It can be a winding and curvy road in many places with a few hairpin turns as well. It is known locally by different names depending on which road it intersects or what section. i.e. Old Quicksand Rd., Broadway, College Ave, Brown St., Main Street, Washington Ave., Panbowl Rd., and so on.

===Airports===
* Julian Carroll Airport – (JKL for FAA, none for IATA) – A publicly owned airport off KY 30. It is home to the National Weather Service Forecast Office that oversees most of the eastern part of the state.

===Railroads===
* CSX is a freight and minerals only line that goes north to Beattyville and eventually to Winchester and south to Hazard. Before CSX owned the line, it was part of the L&amp; N Railway as a passenger and freight line. Before that, it was owned by the defunct Lexington and Eastern Railway Company as a passenger and freight line. The old Jackson Depot and Freight Station located in the South Jackson section on Armory Drive was torn down in the late 1980s.

<text>Cloverport is a home rule-class city in Breckinridge County, Kentucky, United States, on the banks of the Ohio River. The population was 1,152 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town was once known as Joesville after its founder, Joe Huston. Established around 1798 (or possibly 1808) on the east side of where Clover Creek meets the Ohio River. The town was the site of the ferry where, in 1816, Jacob Weatherholt piloted the family of Abraham Lincoln, then seven, across the Ohio River on its way to a newly acquired farm in Spencer County, Indiana.

Around 1820 a building was constructed that became the town&#x27;s first school and was shared by the Baptist and Methodist congregations as a church on Sundays. The town&#x27;s first graveyard, known as the Scott Cemetery, was beside this building which was located south of present Murray Avenue and east of Cherry Street.

The town was renamed Cloverport in 1828 after nearby Clover Creek. Seven years before, in 1821, the Kentucky Legislature had built a toll road between the town and Bowling Green. 1828 also saw the town open a post office with George LaHeist as post master.

In 1829, the Baptist congregation built their own church. In 1831, a new graveyard, known as the Murray Graveyard, was established on the north side of Main Street near the Cherry Street intersection. The Methodist congregation built their own church in 1840 on east Huston Street. The old building then became a church for the town&#x27;s black residents. The Methodist moved again in 1871 to a site on Elm Street.

The town was the site of a button factory, which made use of mussel shells from the Ohio. In the nineteenth century, the Victoria Coal Mines (named in honor of the British queen) produced coal oil from cannel coal that was used to light Buckingham Palace.

In 1857, the first Roman Catholic church, St. Malachi, was built on Chestnut Street south of Huston Street. In 1887, a new church was built and named St. Rose of Lima across the railroad tracks from the old St. Malachi church. The church and rectory were both burned in 1894 and rebuilt at their present locations.
The town was formally incorporated by an act of the state assembly in 1860 and expanded to take in the growing number of homes on the west side of Clover Creek. Land was also donated that year for a Presbyterian church at the corner of Main Street and Lynn Street. A church was never built there but in 1889 the property was exchanged for land on east Main Street where a church was built.

The town had its own newspaper beginning on July 17, 1878. The &quot;Breckenridge News&quot; was started by John D. Babbage and run by his family until 1950 when it was sold to George and Edith Wilson. The Wilsons merged the paper with their other newspaper, the &quot;Irvington Herald&quot;, and formed the &quot;Breckinridge County Herald-News&quot; in 1956.

In 1892 Cloverport became the home of the maintenance shops for the Louisville, Henderson, and St. Louis Railroad. The town raised $20,000 to bring the shops and donated ten acres for the location. The shops employed two hundred men at one time. The shop burned down on March 13, 1916, but was rebuilt. The shops stayed open until 1929 when the Louisville, Henderson and St. Louis was bought out by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. The city and railroad company went to federal court in Louisville with the city trying to force the shops to stay open or for the railroad to pay the city back the original $20,000 that was raised for the shops plus $30,000 in interest. The dispute was settled out of court with the railroad paying back the original $20,000 plus returning the ten acres of land to the city. The city turned the land into an athletic park and a waste treatment facility.

Former United States Supreme Court Justice Wiley Blount Rutledge was born at nearby Tar Springs on July 20, 1894. Rutledge was the son of the pastor of Cloverport&#x27;s Baptist church.

On March 13, 1901, a fire swept through the city leaving about half of the residents homeless and destroying almost all of the business buildings, including two full American Tobacco Company warehouses. The Lucille Memorial Presbyterian Church, whose congregation had just paid off the mortgage, was burned down as was the Methodist church. Damage was estimated to be over $500,000 in the city.

In 1903, The Murray Roofing Tile Company started a tile plant in the city. In 1959 the company merged with other companies to form the Ceramic Tile Division of National Gypsum. This division then became known as American Olean Tile Company.

Another fire struck Cloverport on March 14, 1910, and destroyed many homes on the east side of town. At the time, the closest fire truck was in Owensboro and men from the Louisville, Henderson, and St. Louis Railroad repair yard were credited with saving many homes.

The Methodist church on Elm Street burned down in 1943. Two years later the congregation moved into a renovated building at the intersection of Main Street and Elm Street and was named Grant Memorial Church for their minister, Rev. W. A. Grant. In 1971, Grant Memorial&#x27;s congregation merged with Lucille Memorial Presbyterian church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church to form Cloverport United Methodist Church. This combined congregation purchased land for their new building in 1972 at their current site on south Elm Street.

Every August the town sponsors a festival named for Sacajawea who is purported to have stopped in the town during her journeys.

In 2003, the National Park Service transferred the Cloverport Access Site to the city so that a community riverfront park could be developed. The property included the boat ramp on Clover Creek and 15.7 acres of property.

===Flooding===
Being a river town, Cloverport has been subjected to several floods since its founding. The Ohio River Flood of 1884 had been what all other floods which have struck the city were compared to until 1937. A flood in January 1907 crested at two feet below the 1884 high water mark. The city was also struck by the Great Flood of 1913. The Phelps&#x27; Button factory flooded leaving many out of work and many other families were forced to leave their homes. It was reported that the flood waters were seven feet over the Tar Fork bridge and neck deep on a horse at Hites Run. All of the homes across the river in Tobinsport, Indiana were under water. The Ohio River flood of 1937 saw seventy percent of the town&#x27;s residents hit by the flood waters. The crest of the flood at the downstream Cannelton Locks and Dam was measured at 60.8 feet. This is over six feet higher than the next highest flood, which was the 1945 flood that crested at 54.4 feet. Cloverport was also hit by large floods in 1997, 2011, and 2018.

<text>Hardinsburg is a home rule-class city in Breckinridge County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the seat of its county. The population was 2,343 at the 2010 census. Hardinsburg was named after Captain William Hardin.

==History==

In August 1779, Sinclair Hardin, William&#x27;s cousin, was the first man killed (by the Shawnee) west of the Alleghenies Mountains at Big Springs during an early excursion into the Kentucky wilderness.

Capt. William Hardin, brother of the Col. John Hardin for whom Hardin County was named, established a frontier fort at the site in 1780. The settlement was known variously as Hardin&#x27;s Fort and Hardin&#x27;s Station in the 18th century.

William Hardin received 400 acres as assignee of Benjamin Hardin, Warrant# 2586, dated February 14, 1780, and the tract was surveyed June 8, 1784. According to the description, the land was on Hardin&#x27;s Creek, a branch of the Ohio River, and it was formally granted on June 21, 1786. This area would become Hardinsburg.

Hardinsburg was laid out in 1782 by William Hardin. It is small and its growth has been slow, having failed to number a thousand inhabitants in its first hundred years. Among its early and prominent citizens were Joseph Allen, Captain Thomas Kincheloe, Reverend James Taylor, Philip Lightfoot, Morris Hensly, Charles Hambleton, William Feaman, B and RM Wathen, John McClarty, William Morton, Stanley Singleton, James and Williamson Cox, William Seaton, Francis Peyton, Joseph Thomas, Thornton Smith, Jefferson Jennings and Dr. S.B. Abel. When Judge Kincheloe, Colonel Alf. Allen, Mr. Vivian Daniel, Rev. RG Gardner and Squire Eskridge die, the &quot;old guard&quot; will have become extinct.

William Hardin received grants from the state of Virginia in 1785 for 3800 acres of land, all near the present site of Hardinsburg, Kentucky.

The murder and scalping of young James Jolly was the second colonizer to be murdered by native Kentuckians at Hardin&#x27;s Fort. James was the son of Nelson Jolly Jr., the progenitor of the Jolly family of present-day Breckinridge County. At seventeen years of age, and newly arrived at the fort, James went alone to bring in the horses which were grazing along Clover Creek, a few hundred yards from its palisaded walls. When he did not return, a scouting party eventually found his mutilated body. James Jolly was the first person to die at Hardin&#x27;s Station and the first to be buried under a hickory tree near the banks of Clover Creek, where, both his father and William Hardin were buried when they died.

Hardinsburg was established in 1800 as the seat of government for the newly established Breckinridge County. The first courthouse was a log house built in 1801. Jack Hardin&#x27;s family book states family members laid out the town without compass or chain in the Fall of 1781; their only instruments were a vine and ax. Its post office was established on January 1, 1803, as Breckinridge Court House or Hardinburg.

In 1810, a Roman Catholic church was founded. Originally named St. Rumoldus (St. Rumbold) after the Cathedral in Mechelen, Belgium, the name was later changed to St. Romuald. From 1924 to 1982 the church was served by priests from the Missionaries of the Precious Blood.

A Methodist congregation was formed in 1828.

In 1887, a group met at the courthouse and started the Baptist church for the town.

The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly on May 3, 1890.

<text>Lebanon Junction is a home rule-class city in Bullitt County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 1,746 as of the 2020 census, down from 1,813 as of the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Lebanon Junction is located in southern Bullitt County, on the southeastern edge of Fort Knox. Interstate 65 passes through the city, with access to the downtown area from Exit 105. Via I-65 it is north to Shepherdsville, the county seat, and north to downtown Louisville. Elizabethtown is to the southwest via I-65.

The Rolling Fork river forms the southwest boundary of the city and also serves as the county line, with Hardin County on the opposite side. Nelson County is to the south, across Wilson Creek.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Lebanon Junction has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.71%, is water.

==History==

Lebanon Junction sprang into existence from a railroad switching point that split Louisville and Nashville Railroad (now CSX Transportation) traffic off the mainline to the Lebanon Branch that ended in Lebanon, Kentucky. This branch was completed no later than March 8, 1858, and the town grew out of a need for railroad workers to man the terminal and switching station.

The city of Lebanon Junction was incorporated April 1, 1895. The initial population of the town was &quot;about 700&quot; as detailed in the official surveyor&#x27;s description. The town grew and prospered until May 24, 1912, when a devastating fire swept through the business district, destroying several businesses and residences. This did not hamper the town&#x27;s growth, however, and by the end of 1912 the business section was rebuilt, offering better facilities than before.

The town continued to grow, building a 1st–12th grade school in 1931. The school served as the center of town activities until 1970 when the public education system was consolidated into the Bullitt County school system as mandated by the state. Many a night, townsfolk would pack the gymnasium rebuilt in 1938 after the flood of 1937 to watch basketball games. The school even fielded a six-man football team.

Lebanon Junction was the site of the first parochial school in Bullitt County when Father Harold Ritter established the St. Benedict School in 1948. This school offered education in grades 1-12 from 1949 to 1965. In 1966 it was scaled back and offered 1-8th grades only. The school was closed in 2001.

Growth leveled off in the 1930s with the onset of the Great Depression and the centralization of railroad operations at the southern Louisville yards. This, coupled with the drastic decline in commuter train use, the development of diesel engines, and automated switching and traffic control, lowered the importance of the railroad to the town and vice versa.

Throughout its history, the town has been rocked by flooding along the Rolling Fork river; probably since its inception, but definitely since the great flood of 1937. Floods repeated to varying degrees in 1961, 1964, 1978, 1989, and 1997. After the flood of 1997, new levee work was completed, but that has yet to be tested by another flood.

Despite the many setbacks, both economic and natural, the town has persevered. Today its economic life revolves around its proximity to Interstate 65. Most of the economic growth of the town is centered on the highway exit now. In the 1980s, a gas station and large truck stop were constructed. In 1990, Publisher&#x27;s Printing Company built a large printing facility just to the east of the exit.

Recent development in the town includes the aforementioned levee work, the construction of new wastewater processing lagoons, the shutdown of a dollar store, and various restaurants. A new public library, completed in the summer of 2010, recalls the railroad heritage of the town.

<text>Mount Washington is a home rule-class city in northeast Bullitt County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 18,090 at the 2020 census. The city is one of several surrounding Louisville that have experienced a sharp rise in population in the past three decades, becoming a commuter town.

==History==
Mount Washington is located at what was once the crossroads of two stagecoach routes and was originally known as The Cross Roads. It was formally established in 1822 as Mount Vernon, after President George Washington&#x27;s Virginia home, but it was unable to continue using the name because another town&#x27;s post office had priority. At the time, the settlement housed people and boasted three churches, two schools, six stores and groceries, five doctors, two taverns, and twelve mechanical trades. At the time of its (first) formal incorporation as a city in 1833, the town&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Mount Washington&quot;, again in honor of the first United States president.

Mount Washington became the economic center of Bullitt County by the 1850s. In the autumn of 1862, during the Civil War, the town was held by John Wharton&#x27;s Confederate cavalry, who skirmished with Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden&#x27;s men north of Mount Washington along Floyds Fork on October 1. A defeat the following day led to a Confederate retreat from the area.

Through the nineteenth century, a two-room school building stood on the southern end of Bardstown Road (now Highway 31E), but in 1916 a new building consisting of four classrooms was built. Where the four-room classroom building once stood, now stands Mt. Washington Middle School. This building was constructed in the early 1940s as the high school. Mt. Washington Middle School had to expand and remodel in 1995 because the population was growing tremendously, and now supports over 200 classrooms and offices. Since then, another middle school had to be built on the other side of the city. That project was completed in 2006.

Mount Washington&#x27;s industries aged, and by the 1930s it was no longer the most prominent town in the county. The decline continued when fire burned much of the business district on November 18, 1940. Mount Washington enjoyed an influx of new residents starting in the late 1960s with the opening of General Electric&#x27;s Appliance Park nearby in Louisville. The population of Mount Washington grew from 2,020 in 1970 to over 9,000 by the 2010 census. Despite a downturn at the Appliance Park, eventually leading to the sale of GE&#x27;s appliance division to Haier, Mount Washington continues as a commuter town of Louisville.

The events of the final call of the strip search phone call scam took place in Mount Washington in 2004. The local police department charged David R. Stewart with the crime, but he was acquitted in 2006.

A former mayor of Mt. Washington was a contestant on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, playing the Money Game and winning $185 but losing a PT Cruiser; before the game, he presented host Bob Barker with the key to the city.

<text>Shepherdsville is a home rule-class city on the Salt River in Bullitt County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the second largest city and seat of its county, located just south of Louisville. The population was 14,201 during the 2020 U.S. Census.

==History==
Native Americans have been shown to have lived in the area for at least 15,000 years.

The vicinity was originally known by European Americans as &quot;Bullitt&#x27;s Lick&quot; for the salt licks discovered by surveyor Capt. Thomas Bullitt in 1773. The area was home to Kentucky&#x27;s first commercial salt works. These were shuttered in the 1830s because of competition from Virginian works along the Kanawha River (now in West Virginia). Shepherdsville developed around the mill and store erected along the Salt River by Adam Shepherd, who had purchased in the area. The city received its charter in 1793 and was designated as the county seat when Bullitt County was formed in 1796.

The first post office opened in 1806. In 1836, a mineral water spa called Paroquet Springs opened. The mineral water was believed to have medicinal properties, so people with a variety of maladies visited Shepherdsville to drink and bathe in the water. In the mid-1850s, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad&#x27;s mainline was constructed nearby.

During the Civil War, the railroad bridge over the Salt River at Shepherdsville was a potential target for sabotage and was guarded by Union troops. In 1879 shortly after the formal end of Reconstruction, the Paroquet Springs hotel burned to the ground. Water from the springs continued to be bottled and sold until 1915.

The Lynching of Marie Thompson of Shepherdsville was conducted in 1904, close to the jail near Lebanon Junction.

About 50 people were killed in the Shepherdsville train wreck in late December 1917, a two-train collision that was the deadliest train wreck in Kentucky history.

Throughout most of the 20th century, Shepherdsville&#x27;s economy was based on agriculture. It was a trading center for the county, and important for law and justice related to the county seat. Construction of the Kentucky Turnpike (now Interstate 65) in the 1950s stimulated residential development in the suburbs, as people who worked in Louisville could commute more easily to work. Many moved to Shepherdsville and other outlying areas to have new houses.

==History==

The settlement may have originally been called Funkhouser Hill after Christopher Funkhouser, the local landowner who donated of land to establish a seat for the newly formed Butler County in 1811. The etymology of the city&#x27;s present name (originally written Morgan Town) is uncertain. It may have been chosen to honor a hunter named Morgan or to honor Daniel Morgan Smith, the first white child born in the town. It was incorporated as Morgantown by the state assembly in 1813, although the post office also went by the name Butler Court House during the 19th century.

Granville Allen, a member of the 17th Kentucky Infantry, was one of the first Union soldiers to die in the Civil War, in a skirmish on October 29, 1861. A monument was erected by the Granville Allen Post #93 GAR. This first skirmish between the North and South took place on the Daniel Boone Johnson property. The Johnson Cemetery is still there and is directly above the monument, which is a limestone marker cut into the side of the old Logansport road.

Morgantown has one of only two monuments in the country dedicated to soldiers of both sides who died in the Civil War. The Confederate-Union Veterans&#x27; Monument in Morgantown is located on the grounds of the county courthouse.

The city formerly had a sister city in Tatsuruhama, Japan, but that city is now part of Nanao.

<doc id="115058" wikidata="Q2923146" url="?curid=115058" title="Princeton, Kentucky">
<text>Princeton is a home rule-class city in Caldwell County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the seat of its county. The population was 6,329 during the 2010 U.S. Census. Princeton is home to several notable attractions such as Adsmore Museum, Champion-Shepherdson House (home of the Princeton Art Guild), University of Kentucky Research and Education Center Botanical Garden, and the Annual Black Patch Festival.

==History==
The community at the head of Eddy Creek was first called Eddy Grove for the creek&#x27;s source at a large whirling spring. of surrounding land was granted to the Virginian William Prince for his service during the American Revolution. He settled there in what was then Livingston County in 1799 and erected Shandy Hall, a brick home and tavern. Prince&#x27;s heirs and another local landowner named Thomas Frazier granted around Eddy Grove and Prince&#x27;s Place towards the establishment of a new town in 1817, provided the courthouse of the newly formed Caldwell County was relocated there from Eddyville. The county court accepted the proposal in July and named the new community Princetown, which shortened to Princeton by the time of the Eddy Grove.

Construction of Princeton College began in 1860 but was delayed by the commencement of the Civil War. Confederate troops camped on its campus in 1861, using one of the buildings as a hospital when the area came under Confederate control. Following the Confederate retreat in early 1862, Union soldiers occupied the town for the remainder of the war. In December 1864, Confederate-allied Kentuckian cavalry under Gen. Hylan B. Lyon raided the town and razed the courthouse, which was serving as a Union garrison.

The expansion of railroads in the late 19th century made Princeton an important junction on several major railway lines, most notably the Illinois Central and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Princeton was also at the center of the Black Patch Tobacco Wars that occurred after the turn of the 20th century.

Since 1925, Princeton has housed the University of Kentucky Research and Education Center, a campus of the University of Kentucky&#x27;s College of Agriculture.

===2021 tornado===

A large, violent, and historic tornado tracked through the southern part of Princeton during the late evening hours of December 10, 2021. The tornado traveled about 165.6 miles, forming in northwestern Obion County, Tennessee, and reaching EF4 strength on many occasions along its path, before dissipating in Grayson County, Kentucky. Almost 70 homes were demolished in or near Princeton. Many of the homes damaged or destroyed surrounded the Princeton Golf and Country Club, which now hosts a landfill of approximately 60 homes.

==Geography==
Princeton is located slightly southwest of the center of Caldwell County at (37.107674, -87.882479). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.26%, is water.

U.S. Route 62 (Kentucky) passes through the city center, leading east to Dawson Springs and west to Eddyville. Interstate 69 runs along the northern edge of Princeton, with access from exits 79 (Kentucky Route 91) and 81 (KY 293). KY 91 runs northwest from Princeton to Marion and southeast to Hopkinsville.

Hays Spring, located on Hayes Spring Road west of the city limits, is a natural spring that once supplied the water to the Princeton area.

Princeton was a prime viewing spot for the total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. This eclipse was viewable across the United States, with its maximum peak in Princeton, where totality lasted 2 minutes and 40 seconds.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Princeton has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Culture==

===Night Riders and Black Patch Festival===
Rich in Southern culture much like the rest of Western Kentucky. Every September, Princeton hosts the Black Patch Festival in its historic downtown. Up to 65 booths feature a variety of festival foods, games and activities. One of the highlights of the Black Patch Festival each year is the gospel concert held at the Princeton First Baptist Church.

The festival is named after the unique variety of &quot;Black Patch&quot; tobacco grown in the surrounding areas of western Kentucky and northwest Tennessee. Tobacco was at the center of one of the largest civil uprisings in American history.

By the start of the 20th century, an agricultural boom in dark leaf tobacco had made Caldwell County, along with Christian County, a major tobacco growing area. However, the monopolization of the tobacco market by James B. Duke left many farmers in debt. A vigilante force called the Night Riders was formed to combat the Duke monopoly and terrorized those who cooperated with the tobacco company by destroying crops, burning warehouses, and even physical intimidation.

On December 1, 1906, the Night Riders raided Princeton and burned the largest tobacco factories in the world.

===Big Springs===

This large, natural spring flows from a cave located in the heart of downtown Princeton. The town&#x27;s founder chose to build his home above the spring and established a sawmill close by. Ancient trails used by animals and early Indians, and later by stagecoaches and pioneers, all met at the spring. They led to the major rivers of the area, the Cumberland and the Ohio.

During the Cherokee removal of 1838–39, the Native Americans were to be moved west on steamboats. However, a severe drought in the summer of 1838 made river travel all but impossible. With thousands of people, plus a large number of horses, wagons, and other livestock, water was of the utmost importance for survival. Eleven of the 13 Ross detachments came through Princeton on their way to the Ohio River and stopped at Big Spring.

Big Spring Park, a certified site, is owned by the City of Princeton and is accessible to visitors.

===Adsmore Museum===

Adsmore is a living history museum located on North Jefferson Street in Princeton. It is the only living home museum in Kentucky. Its name is believed to be derived from numerous additions and renovations over 150 years.

Adsmore reflects the lifestyle of the prominent Smith-Garrett family at the close of the &quot;Golden Age&quot;. Tours center on events which took place in the lives of John Parker Smith and Nancy Bond Kevil Smith and their five children: Mayme, Kate, Shell, James Urey (Did) and Selina. Different &quot;seasons&quot; are presented throughout the year to reflect the events of the Smith-Garrett family throughout the years as well as holidays. These different settings include Christmas, Easter, the Black Patch War and weddings and engagements.

===Eddie Pennington Festival===
Princeton is home to the annual Pennington Folk Festival, hosted each summer on the grounds of the Old Butler High School by the Princeton Art Guild. Started in 1997, the Pennington Festival has been a staple music event for western Kentucky, honoring the town&#x27;s own Eddie Pennington for his contributions to folk music and Kentucky&#x27;s own thumbpicking guitar style. Pennington, a nationally recognized musician, continues the tradition of &quot;thumbpicking&quot; popularized by Merle Travis and further developed by instrumentalists such as Chet Atkins.

===Col. Bill Newsom&#x27;s Aged Kentucky Country Ham===

Newsom&#x27;s Old Mill Store and Col. Bill Newsom&#x27;s Aged Country Hams are owned and operated by Nancy Newsom Mahaffey, &quot;the Ham Lady&quot;. Newsom&#x27;s was established January 1, 1917, by H.C. Newsom, Nancy&#x27;s grandfather.

Newsom&#x27;s ham was honored to participate in the 5th World Congress of Dry Cured Hams in Aracena, Spain, in May 2009, and a two-year-old Newsom&#x27;s ham was encased for continuing display in the Jamon Museum there, the only ham in the United States of America to be invited. Newsom&#x27;s ham was also served at the Kentucky Ball during the 2008 Presidential Inauguration.

===Capitol Cinemas===
The original theater on this site was the Savoy Theater. It burned to the ground in 1937. The Capitol Cinemas was built on the same site and opened in 1939. The Capitol was re-opened in 1996 and has been in continuous operation since that time. It is the only restored Art Deco theatre in a small community that shows current movies on three screens.

Capitol Cinemas runs first-run films and holds special events for school, church and community events.

===Historic Downtown and Let&#x27;s Paint the Town!===

Efforts were organized in 2006 to bring the community on board with plans for a &quot;new look&quot; to the downtown historic district. It was emphasized that with community participation, donated funds and volunteer labor, Princeton&#x27;s downtown could be transformed.
In 2008 the Kentucky Heritage Council honored the town with the Ida Lee Willis Memorial Foundation&#x27;s Preservation Award &quot;in recognition of the significant accomplishment involving the preservation and historic restoration through increased awareness and civic involvement&quot; for &quot;Let&#x27;s Paint the Town!&quot;. At the invitation of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, &quot;Let&#x27;s Paint the Town!&quot; was honored to present its success to the nation in Chicago (2009) and Oklahoma City (2010) at the National Main Streets Conference.

Formal ceremonies were held September 7, 1925, for dedication of the Substation to &quot;scientific agriculture and a better Kentucky.&quot; With an initial staff of one, early program emphasis was placed on rebuilding the depleted cropland areas and applying conservation practices to the badly eroded steeper land. Experimental work on liming, fertilizer application, and use of improved seeding mixtures was begun and structures for crop and animal production research were added. Outstanding livestock herds were established and research with pastures, grain crops, tobacco, fruits, and vegetables was expanded.

In 2012, Princeton voted to allow alcohol sales within city limits. Alcohol sales had been illegal since Prohibition.

<text>Murray is a home rule-class city in Calloway County, Kentucky, United States. It is the seat of Calloway County and the 19th-largest city in Kentucky. The city&#x27;s population was 17,307 during the 2020 U.S. census, and its micropolitan area&#x27;s population is 37,191. Murray is a college town and is the home of Murray State University.

==History==

===Early history===

The city now known as Murray began as a post office and trading center sometime in the early 1820s. It was at first called “Williston” in honor of James Willis, an early settler. Later, the name was changed to “Pooltown” after Robert Pool, a local merchant. The name was changed again to “Pleasant Springs” before its incorporation on January 17, 1844, when the present name was adopted to honor Rep. John Murray.

Murray was not the first county seat, which was at Wadesboro. Calloway County was then much larger than today. In 1842, however, the state legislature divided the area, creating Marshall County. It was felt that a more centrally located county seat was needed, and as the village of Murray was at the geographic center, it was chosen. A new courthouse was built along with a jail, and the town Murray was laid out on an plot subdivided into 137 business and residential lots divided by eight streets.

===The Civil War era===

Kentucky did not officially secede from the Union at the start during the Civil War, instead declaring its neutrality, but both Murray and Calloway County were strongly pro-Confederate. Calloway County was one of the counties that sent a delegate to the Russellville Convention signing an Ordinance of Secession in which the Confederate government of Kentucky was formed and Kentucky was admitted into the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, with Bowling Green as the first capital. This region fell under Confederate control early in the war. No major battles were fought near the town, but guerrilla warfare sometimes took place nearby. In the spring of 1862, a Union force stationed in Paducah marched across the county to the Tennessee River, taking anything it wanted from the inhabitants without paying. Also, parts of Murray were burned on several occasions. Once, part of the town was burned by the Union Army in retaliation for its presumed support for the Confederate guerrillas. A diary kept by Josh Ellison of Murray tells that one night during the winter of 1864–65, a detachment of Union soldiers from Paducah torched every building on the east side of the court square, and three days later burned all those north of the square.

An estimated 800 men from the area joined in the Confederate Army, either as infantry in the Kentucky Orphan Brigade or in the cavalry. About 200 sided with the Union. Calloway County&#x27;s Confederate veterans are honored by a monument on the northeast side of the court house square. The Confederate Monument was donated by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and has been subject to calls for removal most recently in 2020. The courthouse grounds on which the statue stands belongs to Calloway County and the County Court voted unanimously in 2020 to keep the statue rather than relocate it from courthouse grounds.

* US 641, locally known as 12th Street, is the main highway in and out of the city. It connects with Interstate 69 to the north, and Interstate 40 to the south. The four-lane US 641 north of Murray is heavily traveled and can see well over 25,000 cars per day within Murray. Currently, US 641 from the south of Murray is a two-lane highway until it reaches the Tennessee state line. However, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet has made plans in its six-year highway plan to widen the highway to four lanes. The current two-lane version has become too saturated, due to the high number of citizens of Tennessee who come to Murray to save on sales tax and the large number of Murray residents who had to travel to Tennessee to buy packaged alcohol before the city voted fully wet in July 2012. 
* Kentucky 80 is the newest divided highway. The highway links Columbus, Kentucky, to the Virginia border and passes just north of Murray. The highway is expected to increase tourism and industry in the Murray area.
* Kentucky 94, locally known as Main Street, is the main east–west road that runs directly through Murray. It connects to U.S. 45 in the west at Water Valley, and to Kentucky 80 in the east near Aurora.
* Kentucky 121, locally known as 4th Street, is another highway that runs through Murray. It connects to Kentucky 80 in the west and Tennessee 119 at the Tennessee border in the east.

Other road projects in Murray are to include the widening of Kentucky 121 through the city of Murray. Over 12,000 cars travel that stretch of road per day. There are also a downtown loop and four-lane bypass in the works to help relieve traffic congestion within the city.

<text>Alexandria is a home rule-class city in Campbell County, Kentucky, in the United States. Along with Newport, it is one of the dual seats of the county. The population was 10,341 at the 2020 census.

==History==

It is believed that the area that is now Alexandria was first settled by Frank Spilman and his family . The Spilman family was from King George County, Virginia, and they may have named their settlement after Alexandria, Virginia. The family had begun developing and selling lots in the settlement by 1819, the year the first post office was established. On February 22, 1834, Alexandria was formally established by an act of the state assembly.

When the Kentucky General Assembly formed Kenton County from part of Campbell County in 1840, they moved Campbell&#x27;s county seat from Newport to Alexandria, which was closer to the center of the redrawn county. The citizens of Alexandria quickly constructed a county courthouse but, because the majority of the county&#x27;s population lived in Newport, the move was not a popular one and it took a court order and a visit from the sheriff to get the county clerk to move.

The city of Alexandria was formally incorporated by act of the state assembly in 1856.

In 1883, Newport successfully lobbied for its own Court House District, allowing it to retain a Court House Commission with taxing authority and various county offices in addition to those maintained at Alexandria. A new courthouse was established in Newport in 1884, and the county&#x27;s fiscal court and judicial offices operated out of this while other administrative offices remained in Alexandria. Nonetheless, the county was not dual seated until 2010.

Pro wrestler B. J. Whitmer resides in Alexandria.

==Geography==
Alexandria is located near the geographic center of Campbell County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.05%, is water. The city is south of Cincinnati, Ohio, on U.S. Route 27. Kentucky Route 9, a four-lane limited access highway, follows the northeastern boundary of Alexandria and leads southeast to Maysville.

==Transportation==
The second oldest road established in Kentucky was the Old State Road, from Newport to Winchester, through Alexandria, Falmouth, Cynthiana, and Paris. This road was established by an act of the Kentucky Legislature in 1836. County residents formed the Newport and Alexandria Turnpike Company to improve the road; the improved turnpike opened in 1856 under the name Alexandria Pike. The road was financed by toll booths, two of which were located in Alexandria. Desiring a free road to the markets in the county, the county government purchased the road in 1921 and made it part of U.S. Route 27.

Because Alexandria does not lie immediately along the Ohio River, its growth has been limited compared to nearby cities that lie along the river.

==Climate==
Alexandria is located at the extreme northern limit of the humid subtropical climate of the Southeastern United States and at the extreme southern limit of the humid continental climate of the Great Lakes region; Alexandria is situated in a climatic transition zone and is influenced by both of these climates. Rolling hills, valleys, and some urban heat effects from the nearby metropolitan areas of Cincinnati, Covington, and Newport are moderating factors to the overall climate of Alexandria.

<text>Bellevue is a home rule-class city in Campbell County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is located along the southern bank of the Ohio River. The population was 5,548 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Before Bellevue was founded, the area was used for hunting, fishing, and warfare by Native Americans tribes such as the Illini, Miami, Shawnee, Cherokee, and Tuscarora. In 1745, a three-day battle occurred in Bellevue among the Shawnee, Miami, and Cherokee Indians, resulting in many deaths.

Bellevue was named for the plantation of Gen. James Taylor Jr., Quartermaster General of the western U.S. Army in the War of 1812. The city was once the eastern part of his plantation. The name Bellevue was taken from the General&#x27;s family plantation in Virginia. Bellevue, or &quot;belle vue,&quot; translates from French to mean &quot;beautiful view.&quot; James Taylor Jr. was the fifth child born to James Taylor Sr. and his wife, Anne Hubbard Taylor, in &#x27;Midway&#x27;, Caroline County, Virginia. His father bought of land in Northern Kentucky from his friend George Muse, part of which Muse had been awarded for his military service in the French and Indian War. James Taylor Jr. was one of the wealthiest men in the state of Kentucky. In 1848, his estate was valued at more than $4 million. Today, his home stands in the East Row local Historic District in the adjoining City of Newport, Kentucky. East Row is the second-largest local district in Kentucky, and the Taylor Mansion is the district&#x27;s oldest house.

The city was formally incorporated by act of the state assembly in 1870. Although it contained only 381 inhabitants in 1870, by 1877, Bellevue was reported to be &quot;growing fast&quot;.

By the 1890s, Bellevue was bustling. Balke&#x27;s Opera House at Berry and Fairfield Avenues served as the town hall and firehouse. A city directory listed 15 grocery stores, four bakeries, six boot makers, seven confectioneries, two livery stables, a blacksmith, three millinaries, six doctors, seven saloons, and a wagon manufacturer.

Throughout Bellevue&#x27;s history, Fairfield Avenue has been the city&#x27;s primary business area. In 1894, Bellevue city fathers, attempting to bring more settlers to the city, published a brochure describing the avenue&#x27;s commercial quality: &quot;Fairfield Avenue, running east and west through the entire town, is the principal business thoroughfare, and business houses are kept well stocked with the latest and best of everything in all branches of trade.

The Taylor&#x27;s Daughters Historic District is the local historic district.

At the turn of the 20th century, Bellevue, like Dayton, was known for its white sandy beaches. A resort called Queen City Beach opened in the summer of 1902 and extended from Washington Avenue to the Dayton city line. At its time it was considered one of the largest inland bathing resorts in the country. A 150 foot veranda hosted lockers, rowboats, skiffs, and sailboats for rental. The number of visitors to the beach decreased due to sewage and industrial dumping in the Ohio River. The beaches vanished after a series of dams and locks raised the level of the Ohio River. In the 1920s Queen City Beach was renamed &quot;Riviera Beach&quot; and then &quot;Horseshoe Gardens&quot; in 1930. The resort stayed open as a dance club and rented boats, but a series of floods caused severe damage. As of 2008 Bellevue Beach Park marks the location of where the Queen City Beach resort once sat.

Bellevue is becoming the bedroom community of Northern Kentucky, while its neighboring cities—Covington and Newport— are becoming the business and entertainment centers. Between 2005 and 2006, the average residential sale price increased by 89 percent, surpassing the market average of every other neighborhood in the Greater Cincinnati area.

==Geography==

Bellevue is located in the extreme northern portion of Kentucky, directly across the Ohio River from the Mount Adams neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio. The city is bordered by Newport to the west, Dayton to the east, Fort Thomas to the south, and the Ohio River and Cincinnati to the north. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , virtually all land.

Bellevue is on a gentle slope that rises toward the Kentucky Highlands region south of the city. Topographically, Bellevue is higher in elevation than its neighboring cities. When the Ohio River would rise, homes in Dayton and Newport would flood while homes in Bellevue (with the exception of homes in proximity to the riverbank) remained safe from rising water. For this reason, Bellevue is not protected by a levee, whereas Dayton and Newport are.

Dayton had a ferry crossing, established in this area by the early 19th century, at the foot of what is now Dayton Pike.
Two separate cities, Jamestown and Brooklyn, separately incorporated in 1848 and 1849 respectively, were merged and reincorporated in 1867 under the name Dayton in honor of the Ohio town.

Jamestown was incorporated March 1, 1848. According to the state charter, the founding fathers were James Berry, James McArthur and Henry Walker. Berry was a nephew of James Taylor, Jr., founder of Newport, Kentucky.

Dayton has a large sandbar just offshore. It had a popular beach for many years known as the &quot;Manhattan Bathing Beach&quot;, until the US Army Corps of Engineers raised the level of the Ohio River. In 1779, the beach was involved in the Battle of Dayton, KY; the fight involved Simon Girty, Alexander McKee, Col, John Campbell, Col. David Rogers and Capt. Robert Benham. Laws were passed prohibiting nude swimming in the Ohio River during daylight hours and prohibiting dogs from running loose. Violators of the nude swimming law faced a penalty of $1 for the first offense and as much as $5 for subsequent offenses. People also had the right to shoot dogs that were running loose in the city, and bill the owners for carcass removal. In 1919, the private Doyle Country Club was built and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Floods in 1884, 1913, and 1937 – the latter affecting 80 percent of the city and prompting residents to take shelter in the garages of the former Wadsworth Watch Case Co. – caused many of the companies in the once-booming town to move elsewhere. By the 1950s, many residents, weary of constant flooding, moved out of the town as well. A floodwall was finally completed in late 1981.

Today, Dayton is working on downtown revitalization and a historical survey of the city; it is the first step toward creating a historic district in the city.

<text>Fort Thomas is a home rule-class city in Campbell County, Kentucky, United States, on the southern bank of the Ohio River and the site of an 1890 US Army post. The population was 17,483 at the 2020 census, making it the largest city in Campbell County. It is part of the Cincinnati – Northern Kentucky metropolitan area.

==History==
Evidence suggests that on or around 1749, prior to settlement by Europeans, a large battle occurred between a band of Cherokee Native Americans and victorious Miami tribe and Shawnee tribe Native Americans in what is now the city of Fort Thomas. As many as 600 graves of slain warriors have been unearthed by archeologists there.

===Fort Thomas Army Post===
In 1887, a site was needed to house a United States Army post to replace Newport Barracks located in the adjoining city of Newport, Kentucky. Built in 1803, Newport Barracks replaced the smaller Fort Washington, located across the Ohio River in Cincinnati, Ohio. That army post was located at the junction of the Licking and Ohio Rivers, but it was prone to flooding and flooded numerous times during the early 1880s. A new, less flood prone location was sought. General Philip Sheridan personally selected of the city and dubbed the area the Highlands, predicting it to become the &quot;West Point of the West.&quot; The new post was named Fort Thomas in honor of General George Henry Thomas.

The area has many remnants of this era with a high Stone Water Tower as a familiar landmark which stands at the entrance to Tower Park. It was the 16th structure built on the grounds of the Military Reservation. It encloses a standpipe which has a capacity of 100,000 gallons, pumped from the Water District reservoirs just across South Fort Thomas Avenue. In 1890 when the military base was established, such provisions for water supply was necessary as there was no other water tower in this area. Cannons that were captured in Cuba&#x27;s Havana Harbor during the Spanish–American War rest on stone platforms in front of the Tower. The dates marked on these cannons, reflecting the date they were made in Barcelona, Spain, are &quot;1768&quot; and &quot;1769.&quot;

The U.S. 6th Infantry Regiment moved to Fort Thomas, where it remained until called to action again in June 1898, in the Spanish–American War. 

Also stationed at Fort Thomas during the Spanish–American War were the 8th Volunteer Infantry, known as the &quot;8th Immunes.&quot; At the time, many erroneously believed that African Americans were naturally immune to tropical diseases or at least were better suited for service in the tropical environment of the Caribbean, and fearing the outbreak of tropical disease, actively recruited African-American soldiers for the conflict. Also, active service in the armed forces was considered beneficial to the status of African Americans in the United States, and was therefore lobbied for by civil rights leaders at the time. Booker T. Washington wrote the Secretary of the Navy that Cuba&#x27;s climate was &quot;peculiar and danger[o]us to the unaclimated [sic] white man. The Negro race in the South is accustomed to this climate.&quot; Other black leaders lobbied in Washington to reserve all ten regiments for their race. Although they lacked the political clout to accomplish that lofty goal, President McKinley was well aware that most states had refused to accept black volunteers, and he wanted to recognize the martial spirit of the minority that staunchly supported his Republican party. On 26 May, the adjutant general&#x27;s office issued General Orders, No. 55, indicating that five of the Immune regiments would be composed of &quot;persons of color,&quot; commanded by officers who were also people of color. The others were composed of white men who had already contracted tropical diseases.

Fort Thomas served as a depot, induction center, and military hospital. Most of the garrison was transferred to the Veterans Administration in 1946, but military activities continued until the fort was closed in 1964.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (11.82%) is water.

===Climate===
Fort Thomas is located within a climatic transition zone at the extreme northern limit of the humid subtropical climate. The local climate is a basically a blend of the subtropics to the south and the humid continental climate to the north. There are several &quot;micro-climates&quot; found in Fort Thomas which produce warmer than usual or cooler than usual &quot;pockets&quot;. In the warmer niches it is not at all uncommon to find such &quot;subtropical&quot; novelties as the common wall lizard, the Southern magnolia &quot;(Magnolia grandiflora)&quot;, and even the rare Dwarf palmetto; Blue spruce and Salamander tend to occur in the cooler and shaded niches. Moderating variables for the overall climate of Fort Thomas include: the Ohio River, the region&#x27;s relatively large hills and valleys, and an urban heat influence due to the proximity of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky (Covington, Newport, etc.) metropolitan area. Fort Thomas is located within the Bluegrass region of Kentucky and Southern Ohio and is also situated within the northern periphery of the Upland South.

<doc id="115072" wikidata="Q1762809" url="?curid=115072" title="Newport, Kentucky">
<text>Newport is a home rule-class city at the confluence of the Ohio and Licking rivers in Campbell County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 14,150 at the 2020 census. Historically, it was one of four county seats of Campbell County. Newport is a major urban center of Northern Kentucky and is part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area.

==History==

Newport was settled by James Taylor Jr. on land purchased by his father James Sr. from George Muse, who received it as a grant. Taylor&#x27;s brother, Hubbard Taylor, had been mapping the land twenty years prior. It was not named for its position on the river but for Christopher Newport, the commander of the first ship to reach Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. Newport was established as a town on December 14, 1795, and incorporated as a city on February 24, 1834. In 1803, the Ft. Washington military post was moved from Cincinnati to become the Newport Barracks. A bridge first connected Newport to Covington in 1853, and the first bridge spanning the Ohio River to Cincinnati, the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge, opened in 1866. Newport experienced large German immigration in the 1880-90s.

By 1900, Newport was the third largest city in Kentucky, after Covington and Louisville, although Newport and Covington were rightly considered satellites of Cincinnati.

Prohibition under the Volstead Act of 1919 resulted in a widespread illegal sale of alcohol. Many gangsters began to smuggle alcohol into the city to supply citizens and businesses. Speakeasies, bribery, and corruption became a norm in Newport. A well known Newport crime boss was gambler and National Crime Syndicate member Ed Levinson.

In 1921, Newport was rocked by a steel mill strike of +2,000 workers, following the end of WW1 and steel industry downturn. The strike involved one in five of the town&#x27;s workers and was over recognition for the three unskilled union locals that made up the four locals within the union. During it, following unrest and the company arming the mill with machine guns, state militia companies and later tanks were stationed in the town, withdrawn in late 1922. The strike was partially broken by the end of 1922 with some steelworkers leaving the town and others finding separate jobs in Newport. However, the strike did not formally end until seven years later in 1928, without union recognition for the three locals.

Newport&#x27;s worst natural disaster occurred in 1937, when a flood covered a great part of the city. A flood wall was completed in 1948, and remains a significant part of Newport&#x27;s landscape.

Newport once had the reputation of &quot;Sin City&quot; due to its upscale gambling casinos on Monmouth street. Monmouth also had many men&#x27;s stores, restaurants, and ice cream parlors. Investigations for racketeering pushed out the casinos, which were replaced by peep shows and adult strip clubs. Many of the old businesses disappeared when parking became difficult on Monmouth Street and the commercial district opened on the hill of south Newport.

A garage at 938 John Street manufacturing illegal fireworks exploded without warning in 1981, leaving severe damage up to a six-block radius.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Newport made plans to develop its riverfront and core to focus primarily on &quot;family friendly&quot; tourism, instead of the &quot;Sin City&quot; tourism of the past. In May 1999 the $40-million Newport Aquarium opened, and the historic Posey Flats apartments were leveled in favor of the Newport on the Levee entertainment complex, which opened the following year.

In 1997 plans for a structure called the &quot;Millennium Tower&quot; were revealed. The tower&#x27;s main selling point was that building it would be financed by private money, as opposed to taxpayer money. The tower was expected to be completed by 2003, but investors later pulled out and no construction was done. Today the site for the tower is a parking lot next to the World Peace Bell.

In the 21st century, Newport has experienced development with the entertainment industry.

===County seat===
Newport is a county seat of Campbell County, and was previously a county seat from 1797 until 1823, and again from 1824 until 1840.
In the 19th century, the overwhelming majority of the population lived in Newport and the surrounding cities. Many citizens did not like traveling south to Alexandria to conduct county business, as southern Campbell County was primarily undeveloped.

In 1883, Newport successfully lobbied the state legislature for an exception to state law, which both required that a county seat be located in the center of the county, and that certain county business only be conducted at the county seat. Frankfort passed a special law, creating the Newport Court House District, and within that district, the Newport Courthouse Commission which functioned as a special taxing district, so that an additional courthouse could be built, and business could take place in Newport, in addition to Alexandria. In 2008, the Kentucky General Assembly removed the taxing authority from the Courthouse Commission, but left the District and Commission intact.
In 2009, a court ruled that Alexandria is the only county seat, and Newport is not a county seat. On November 24, 2010, the Kentucky Court of Appeals disagreed, and granted Newport equal status as a county seat. On August 25, 2011, the Supreme Court of Kentucky denied review of the appellate decision.

Bardwell was founded in 1874 when a predecessor rail line of the Illinois Central Railroad was extended to that point.

Other sources suggest the name was inspired by a &quot;boarded well&quot; at the camp.

During their session of 1877–1878, the Kentucky General Assembly passed an act incorporating Bardwell. The original municipal boundaries consisted of a circle with a radius of , centered on the local train station for the Illinois Central Railroad.

<text>Carrollton is a home rule-class city in—and the county seat of—Carroll County, Kentucky, United States, at the confluence of the Ohio and Kentucky rivers. The population was 3,938 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Carrollton is located in northern Carroll County. The city is situated on the Ohio River at the mouth of the Kentucky River. It is bordered by the city of Prestonville to the west across the Kentucky River. To the north, across the Ohio River, is Switzerland County, Indiana.

==History==
Carrollton was laid out in 1792, and it was known as Port William initially. It served as the county seat of Gallatin County until 1843 when the county was split, creating Carroll County. Port William was renamed Carrollton after Declaration of Independence signer Charles Carroll and became the seat of the new county. The town&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Carrollton Crier&quot;, was published in 1848. On September 3, 1863, during the Civil War, Confederates robbed the Southern Bank of Kentucky and were followed by the Union Army. Confederates also stole the sword of prominent resident William Orlando Butler, and he later caught up with the troops and retrieved it. The Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad was built near town in 1868 and eventually became more important to the town&#x27;s economy than river traffic. It did cause a spike in agricultural production, especially tobacco.

Carrollton&#x27;s most severe flood was the Ohio River flood of 1937; floodwaters crested at .

It has one of the state&#x27;s largest tobacco markets, and the population has remained steady since being recorded at 3,884 in the 1970 census. In 1988, the Carrollton bus disaster garnered national attention for what was one of the worst bus collisions in United States history.

==In literature==
The town of Hargrave, Kentucky in the fiction of Wendell Berry is a fictionalized version of Carrollton. Berry uses Carrollton&#x27;s original name, Port William, as the name for the town in which most of his stories take place. Berry portrays Hargrave as significantly larger and more urban than Port William (a fictionalized Port Royal, Kentucky). It is the center of local nightlife and professional services. Unlike the largely egalitarian rural society of Port William, there is an &quot;upper crust&quot; of professionals and landowners in Hargrave.

<text>Olive Hill is a home rule-class city along Tygarts Creek in Carter County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 1,599 during the year 2010 U.S. Census.

==History==
Olive Hill began as a rural trading post established by the Henderson brothers in the first part of the 19th century. Although Olive Hill was allegedly named by Elias P. Davis for his friend Thomas Oliver, there is no evidence to support this popular contention. In 1881, the town was moved from a hillside location to the current location in the Tygarts Creek valley, where the Elizabethtown, Lexington, and Big Sandy Railroad had laid tracks. The hillside location become known as Old Olive Hill and now serves as the city&#x27;s residential area. On March 24, 1884, Olive Hill incorporated as a city and served as the county seat of the short-lived Beckham County from February 9 to April 29, 1904.

The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway served Olive Hill and many other places on the railroad&#x27;s Lexington Subdivision (running from Ashland to Lexington). The C&amp;O merged into the Chessie System, which CSX Transportation later bought out, and after that CSX pulled up the railroad in the mid-1980s. Olive Hill retained and restored a passenger depot as well as a caboose (&quot;John Hop Brown&quot; Memorial Park).

According to George C. Wright in his A History of Blacks in Kentucky, volume 2, &quot;In the small community of Olive Hill in 1917, several hundred white laborers at the brick-making General Refractories Company threatened to strike unless recently employed blacks were dismissed. After first refusing to meet with the leaders of the disgruntled workers, the company managers acceded to their demand and fired all the black workers,&quot;(p. 14).

<text>Hopkinsville is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Christian County, Kentucky, United States. The population at the 2020 census was 31,180.

==History==

===Early years===
The area of present-day Hopkinsville was initially claimed in 1796 by Bartholomew Wood as part of a grant for his service in the American Revolution. He and his wife Martha Ann moved from Jonesborough, Tennessee, first to a cabin near present-day W. Seventh and Bethel streets; then to a second cabin near present-day 9th and Virginia streets; and finally to a third home near 14th and Campbell.

Following the creation of Christian County the same year, the Woods donated of land and a half interest in their Old Rock Spring to form its seat of government in 1797. By 1798, a log courthouse, jail, and &quot;stray pen&quot; had been built; the next year, John Campbell and Samuel Means laid out the streets for &quot;Christian Court House&quot;. The community tried to rename itself &quot;Elizabeth&quot; after the Woods&#x27; eldest daughter, but Elizabethtown, Kentucky pre-ëmpted the name, and the Kentucky Assembly established the town in 1804 as &quot;Hopkinsville&quot; after veteran and state representative Samuel Hopkins of Henderson County (later the namesake of Hopkins County as well and despite being in a neighboring county and having the same namesake, Hopkinsville was never the county seat of Hopkins County, despite Hopkins County being created from Christian and Henderson Counties).

Along with the rest of Kentucky, the town was late in establishing free lower education, but natives organized private schools, and the town was the home of South Kentucky College (est. 1849) and Bethel Female College (est. 1854).

Since 1854, Hopkinsville has been the site of the Western Kentucky Lunatic Asylum.

===Civil War===
The Civil War generated major divisions in Christian County. Confederate support in Hopkinsville and Christian County was evident in the formation of the &quot;Oak Grove Rangers&quot; and the 28th Kentucky Cavalry. Christian County was the actual birthplace of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America, though his birthplace is now part of Todd County, Kentucky. Several local businessmen and plantation owners contributed money and war supplies to the South. After Confederate forces retreated to Tennessee, however, Camp Joe Anderson was established by the Union to the northwest of Hopkinsville in 1862. Men who trained there became members of the 35th Kentucky Cavalry, the 25th Kentucky Infantry, and the 35th Kentucky Infantry. Gen. James S. Jackson had been a Hopkinsville attorney before the war and was killed in service to the Union at the Battle of Perryville in October 1862. Private citizens who supported the Union cause provided the army with mules, wagons, clothing, and food.

The occupation of Hopkinsville changed at least half a dozen times between the Confederate and Union forces. In December 1864, Confederate troops under Gen. Hylan B. Lyon captured the town and burned down the Christian County courthouse which was being used at that time by the Union army as a barracks. Another skirmish between Union and Confederate forces took place in the field opposite Western State Hospital near the end of the war. 

===Black Patch tobacco===

The Evansville, Henderson, and Nashville Railroad was the first to connect Hopkinsville to surrounding cities in 1868. In 1879, it was purchased by the L&amp;N. The Ohio Valley Railroad (later purchased by the Illinois Southern) reached the city in 1892, as did the Tennessee Central in 1903.

The tobacco from the Black Patch region was highly desired in Europe. In 1904, tobacco planters formed the Dark Tobacco District Planters&#x27; Protective Association of Kentucky and Tennessee in opposition to a corporate monopoly by the American Tobacco Company (ATC) owned by James B. Duke. The ATC used their monopoly power to reduce the prices they paid to farmers; the planters&#x27; association aimed to organize a boycott of sales to drive the price back up. Many farmers continued to sell independently or secretly, however, prompting the association to form a &quot;Silent Brigade&quot; to pressure such farmers into compliance. With societal pressure seeming to fail, the Silent Brigade (probably under Dr. David A. Amoss) organized the Night Riders (not to be confused with the Ku Klux Klan) to terrorize farmers into submission.

On December 7, 1907, 250 masked Night Riders seized Hopkinsville&#x27;s police station and cut off all outside contact. They pursued tobacco executives who bought tobacco from farmers who were not members of the Dark Tobacco District Planters&#x27; Protective Association and city officials who aided them. Three warehouses were burned, one of whose sites became Peace Park. In April of the next year, a tobacco broker in Paducah named W.B. Kennedy wrote to associates in Rotterdam that &quot;Out of all the mischief that has been done the law has not been able to convict and punish the night-riders. They do their mischief in the night, and wear masks, and they have taken a pledge to never tell anybody anything they know, and for this reason it is impossible to get sufficient evidence to convict them. They have gone on with their mischief making, until they have almost ruined the country.&quot;

===Tornadoes===
On April 2, 2006, an F3 tornado swept through parts of Hopkinsville. In the storm, 200 homes were damaged and 28 people were injured. In addition, structural damage was reported to dozens of other businesses, along with countless trees, power lines, transmission towers and other structures, cutting electricity to the city of Hopkinsville. A gas line was also damaged, causing a gas leak. On January 1, 2022, an EF2 tornado struck Hopkinsville, removing the canopy from a gas station, and destroying the petrol pumps. A church lost parts of its roof, and trees were snapped and some uprooted along the path. This was the first confirmed tornado of 2022.

On March 31, 2023, the downtown area sustained noteworthy damage from straight-line winds of up to 90 mph, lifting off the upper floor of restaurant The Mixer in the former Young Hardware space, as well as damaging the city&#x27;s clock tower and the Woody Winfree Fire and Transportation Museum.

<doc id="115093" wikidata="Q211665" url="?curid=115093" title="Askja">
<text>Askja () is an active volcano situated in a remote part of the central highlands of Iceland. The name Askja refers to a complex of nested calderas within the surrounding Dyngjufjöll mountains, which rise to , &quot;askja&quot; meaning &quot;box&quot; or &quot;caldera&quot; in Icelandic.

== Geography ==
The Askja central volcano is in diameter and is associated with the Askja volcanic system which has a long fissure swarm that extends north from beneath the Vatnajökull glacier towards the north coast of Iceland. The Hrúthálsar area which is to the north-east is now usually regarded as part of the system.

The outer caldera of Askja, representing a prehistoric eruption, is about in area, and there is evidence of other later caldera-forming events within it. These include the main summit caldera, that is about in diameter, to its north-east the diameter Kollur caldera, and the 1875 Öskjuvatn caldera with a diameter of about . The main crater floor lies at about .

The central volcano region is only accessible for a few months of the year. Being situated in the rain shadow to the northeast of the Vatnajökull glacier, the area receives only about of rainfall annually.

=== NASA ===
The area was used by NASA during training for the Apollo program to prepare astronauts for the lunar missions. Their main objective in Askja was to study geology. The Astronaut Monument in Húsavík lists the 32 astronauts who participated.

== Eruptions ==
Most eruptions are small, basaltic and effusive. There have been at least 175 eruptions from the Askja system in the last 7200 years.

=== 1961 ===
The last eruption of Askja was between 26 October and 5 December 1961 near the northern rim of the caldera. It produced the basaltic Vikrahraun lava flow and also near the caldera another local permafrost layer under the of tephra.

=== 1875 ===
Askja was virtually unknown until a large 17 hour subplinian eruption which started on March 28, 1875. The volcanic system had been active since 1 January 1875. This was followed by the devastating rhyolitic phreatoplinian explosion on March 29, 1875, which erupted dense-rock equivalent. The eruption finished on 17 October 1875. Locally around the caldera this ash fall on snow cover has resulted in the formation of a layer of permafrost ice. Especially in the Eastfjords of Iceland, the ashfall was heavy enough to poison the land and kill livestock. Ash more than 1 cm in thickness covered and the total population in Iceland of sheep declined by 2% and cattle by 6.2% between 1874 and 1876. At least 16 farms were abandoned in 1876. Ash, or tephra from this eruption was wind-blown to Norway, Sweden, Germany and Poland. The eruption triggered a spike in emigration from Iceland but not as much as the Grímsvötn eruptions in the 1880s. Between February and October 1875 about north of the Askja central volcano there were episodic basaltic fissure eruptions, which erupted a comparable volume of magma to the explosive phase. The eruption had no direct effect on regional or Northern Hemisphere vegetation and climate.

=== Early Holocene ===
Another less well-known large rhyolitic eruption, called Askja-S (Skolli), occurred in the early Holocene, 10,824 ± 97 years . Tephra from this eruption has been found in south-east Sweden, Northern Ireland and north Norway and recently as far south as Romania, which makes it one of the most far-travelled Icelandic tephras.

=== Summary ===
=== Activity ===
In June 2010, Volcano expert Hazel Rymer said seismic activity was increasing at Askja. The increased earthquake activity was located to the northeast of the central volcano, in the direction of Herðubreið. It was ruled out that any activity from Eyjafjallajökull was responsible for the increase in activity at Askja. The news came as scientists continue to watch Katla. In early April 2012 it was noted that the lake in the caldera was totally clear of ice, which usually does not happen until in June or July in a normal year. It was believed that increased geothermal activity in the volcano is heating the lake. Travel in the area was restricted until further research could be carried out.

In early September 2021, GPS and Satellite data showed that an inflation at the rate of five cm per month, most likely attributed to magma intrusion, of the caldera had started in August. An Article published on September 9 from the Icelandic Meteorological Office(IMO) stated the Aviation Color Code was upgraded from &quot;Green&quot; to &quot;Yellow&quot; due to the changes. The Article also says, &quot;Next week IMO and the Institute of Earth Sciences (UÍ) will potentiate the monitoring network around Askja to allow a better coverage and surveillance of the volcano.&quot; On 9 November 2022 deformation data showed continuing magma accumulation at depth, with accumulated uplift of since August 2021.

== Öskjuvatn lake ==
Öskjuvatn is a large lake that fills much of the smaller caldera resulting from the 1875 eruption. Its surface lies about below the level of the main caldera floor and covers about . When the lake originally formed it was warm, but today it is frozen over for most of the year. Öskjuvatn is the second deepest lake in Iceland at deep.

== Missing scientists ==
In 1907, the German scientists Walter von Knebel and Max Rudloff visited Askja to study the caldera. While exploring Öskjuvatn in a small boat, they disappeared without a trace. Von Knebel&#x27;s fiancée Ina von Grumbkow led an expedition to search for them, but no indication of what happened to them was ever found. Recent observations on the effects of a landslide, on 21 July 2014, has led to renewed speculation that the scientists were killed by a similar sudden event, a massive wave similar to the one estimated to be high seen in 2014.

== Social context of 1875 Askja eruption ==

The eruption took place at a time that Iceland was newly self governing under Danish rule, with a strong nationalist element, had a large rural agricultural population, and needed the fodder ruined by the eruption to overwinter livestock, in an up to then, relatively prosperous farming area. Following local publicity of the plight of farming communities in May 1775, and a letter to The Times in July 1775, fund-raising efforts in the UK, Denmark, and Norway took place and relief supplies were organised. The combined donations helped many of the most affected and paid for fodder to help keep livestock alive over the winter of 1875/6. The emigration options were limited, as the possibility of organised self funded emigration from Iceland to Canada or Brazil only became possible in January 1873, and by the time of the eruption the experiences reported home of the emigrants were far from all being positive. Canada in particular successfully promoted itself and addressed partially the initial issues, with partially subsidised emigration that excluded deliberately the Icelandic poor, for multiple reasons both commercial and social. However the Iceland nationalist political movement tried to block emigration, even misrepresenting that its new Emigration Law made the Canadian plan impossible, when the law had yet to be ratified in Denmark. A deposit paid to the Danish Governor of Iceland and advertising emphasising the impact of the eruption eased the Canadian plan. While most emigration in 1876 was by Icelanders resident outside the areas most affected by the ash it did result in up to 10% of the population in those districts most affected, leaving Iceland.

== Sights and tourism in the area ==

The Dyngjufjöll mountains which surround the Askja caldera, also contain the &quot;Drekagil&quot; , the canyon of dragons. Within and of Askja, are two other volcanic systems: Herðubreið and Kverkfjöll.

Askja is a popular tourist destination. There are two mountain huts and a campsite at Dreki , by Drekagil, which is about by a 4x4 F-road, from the Icelandic ring-road. The road continues up from Dreki into the Askja caldera. It is a walk of about from the car park to Öskjuvatn and Víti . The roads are usually only open for about three to four months, from late June until early October.

There was a local legend in the town that this was in honor of the hometown of Gen. Garrard&#x27;s second wife Lucy Lees, but a prominent local family, the Hollingsworth, were originally from Manchester, England. Rennick points out that Lees was born well after the naming of the city. He opines that it is more likely that the local businessmen simply wanted a name evocative of the English industrial success.

The Albany-Clinton County Chamber of Commerce has an annual dinner on the courthouse square called &quot;All for Benny.&quot;

During the Civil War, Albany was attacked by Confederate forces, and many buildings, including the courthouse, were burned. The area was also the scene of much guerrilla activity on both sides.

<text>Burkesville is a home rule-class city in Cumberland County, Kentucky, in the United States. Nestled among the rolling foothills of Appalachia and bordered by the Cumberland River to the south and east, it is the seat of its county. The population was 3,713 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Burkesville began as a small riverside settlement even before the Iroquois Indians officially sold the land in 1768. The settlement was originally called Cumberland Crossing. In 1846, it was incorporated as a city and named Burkesville after Isham Burk, a prominent citizen leader at that time.

Just as Kentucky was a border state in the Civil War, so was Burkesville a border town. Burkesville stood on the Cumberland River, a major natural barrier between opposing forces, so Union and Confederate troops as well as guerillas led by Champ Ferguson sparred across the countryside. Confederate General John Hunt Morgan tore through the area while conducting Morgan&#x27;s Raid, and Confederate General Hylan B. Lyon&#x27;s raids in December 1864 burned seven courthouses, ending with the one in Burkesville on January 3.

Burkesville was a fairly busy river port whose heyday came during the latter part of the nineteenth century, when water transportation was the most feasible way to move large quantities of goods. The rise of larger craft, such as the riverboat, required diligent dredging of the riverbed to keep it navigable so far upstream. The last steamboat docked in Burkesville in 1929, the year after the first major road was opened to the larger city of Glasgow, to the west. The river&#x27;s head of commercial navigation moved from Burnside (which has a railroad) to Burkesville (which does not) when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began building Wolf Creek Dam without a lock about 25 miles upstream before World War II. The dam controlled flooding that had plagued the town from its beginning, but was the last nail in the coffin of commercial navigation. The corps&#x27; impoundment of Dale Hollow Reservoir in 1944 gave the town a tourist and fishing trade, and development of a trout fishery on the river from the dam to Burkesville has also provided a small economic boost, as has development of Dale Hollow Lake State Resort Park.

Burkesville had a pack horse library serving rural residents in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

Today the main routes of access to the city are State Highways 90 and state 61. KY 90 East and KY 61 South are part of the Appalachian Development Highway System; Burkesville has the only 90-degree turn in an APD corridor, because the original route was moved west to please Tennessee Congressman Joe L. Evins and perhaps Kentucky Congressman Tim Lee Carter of Tompkinsville. An old-fashioned town square sits on Main Street, which splits and forms a circle around the Cumberland County court house, the third incarnation of the structure. The first was built by Thomas Lincoln, the father of Abraham Lincoln. Original buildings ring the square on three sides; the fourth was razed to make way for a modern justice center, completed in 2006. Two streets branch off perpendicular to Main: River Street runs straight toward the Cumberland River and provides access to the town&#x27;s only public boat ramp, while Hill Street immediately begins scaling the Alpine Hill that towers over the city. This road was the only access to the city from the west for many years until Highway 90 was rerouted through a gap called the Sawmill Cut, site of a small sawmill until the road was further modernized in the 21st century. Highway 61 North was most recently modernized; the highway and park improvements were pushed by Burkesville lawyer David Williams as president of the state Senate from 2000 to 2013.

<text>Ravenna is a home rule-class city in Estill County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 605 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The US Federal Census dated 7 Aug,1820 reflects a town located in Estill Co., KY as &quot;Ravenna&quot;, but before it was incorporated, Ravenna was known only as &quot;The Village&quot;.

The Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad was responsible for the name of Ravenna, the building of the shops, yard, office building, passenger and freight station, and many other things that were built for the establishment of a railroad terminal in Estill County just east of the county seat, Irvine. After the completion of the terminal in 1915, the county decided it would call it &quot;Ravenna&quot;, which stems from the word &quot;ravine&quot;. It was reported by early railroad officials that an Italian foreman and interpreter, with a construction crew of approximately 60 Italian men building the railroad yards, requested that the railroad officials name the station in honor of his birthplace, Ravenna, Italy, and it was so granted by the railroad officials in charge of such matters.

A thriving village sprang up in 1915, when the railroad started construction of its shops; and five years later in 1920, Ravenna was incorporated as a 6th-class City by the Estill County Circuit Court.

In 1924 Ravenna was declared a 5th-class city by an act of the Kentucky State Legislature due to an increase in population. This also entitled them to have a mayor, six councilmen and city clerk, and fire and police departments. By this time in its history, Ravenna had become an almost entirely white city. In 1920, hundreds of &quot;black railroad workers were forced to leave their jobs and their community

Ravenna is home of the local VFW Post #8019; a National Guard armory that is home to C Company, 1–149th Infantry (M), 149th BDE; and the Estill County Veterans Memorial in Ravenna&#x27;s Veterans Memorial Park.

===Ravenna Tile===
In order to express sympathy following the tornado disaster of June 9, 1961, the Italian city of Ravenna donated a design on a glazed tile to Ravenna, Kentucky.

<text>Allen, also known as Allen City, is a home rule-class city in Floyd County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 193 at the 2010 census, up from 150 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Allen was first settled in the early 19th century. The first post office was named &quot;Mouth of Beaver&quot; and was established on August 21, 1854 (Thomas P. Johns, postmaster). The town began to develop rapidly after the establishment of a Chesapeake and Ohio Railway station. The station was interchangeably known as &quot;Beaver Creek&quot; and &quot;Beaver Creek Junction&quot;. In 1905, another post office opened and was named &quot;Allen&quot; after local resident T.J. Allen. The town was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1913. In 1936, the railroad station was renamed to prevent confusion during mail delivery. An area outside the city limits known as &quot;New Allen&quot; began to develop in 1937 after a bridge was constructed across the Levisa Fork River.

In October 1981, a 70-year-old local miner shot eight people at an auto parts store, killing five and wounding three others. The shooting was reportedly sparked by a dispute with one of the victims.

On June 30, 2022, a mass shooting targeting police officers occurred in Allen. Three police officers and a police dog were killed, and four other people were injured, including three officers. The alleged shooter, 49-year-old Lance Storz, was arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder of a police officer.

==History==

In 1911, the Elk Horn Coal Company established a coal camp at the confluence of Steele Creek and the Right Fork of Beaver Creek. This place had been known as “Martin’s Mill” since before the start of the Civil War, due to Rev. “Old” John Martin&#x27;s Grist Mill, which was located on Mill Creek. During the Civil War, after the Battle of Middle Creek, Confederate General Humphrey Marshall and his forces camped there at the mill, while on their way back to Virginia. During the period of 1911 to 1914 the coal camp was called different names, including “Camp Steele Creek” and “Watson Town.” They later named this place Wayland, after Clarence Wayland Watson, the president of the company. In April 1914 the railroad arrived, and on May 18, the town post office was established. The coal camp&#x27;s construction wasn&#x27;t completed until the early 1920s. Wayland was incorporated as a sixth-class city in 1923.

In the first decade of the 20th century, the Southern Baptist clergyman Monroe E. Dodd began his long ministry at a church in Fulton. For many years afterward, he was the pastor of First Baptist Church of Shreveport, Louisiana.

===Banana Capital of the World===
The United Fruit Co., now Chiquita, began shipping bananas from South America by steamship to New Orleans. The bananas were loaded onto railcars on top of blocks of ice for the trip north. Fulton had the only ice house on the route north to Chicago. The bananas were re-iced with blocks from the Fulton Ice Plant, now closed. Empty railcars were pulled up to the side of the ice house, and the large blocks of ice were loaded end up, covering the entire box car. The bananas were laid on top of the ice to continue their journey. At one point, more than 70% of the bananas that were consumed in the US passed through Fulton.

<text>Warsaw is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Gallatin County, Kentucky, United States, located along the Ohio River. The name was suggested by a riverboat captain, who was reading &quot;Thaddeus of Warsaw&quot;, by Jane Porter, when the city was being founded.

The city had a population of 1,615 at the 2010 census, down from 1,811 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Warsaw began as a landing on the Ohio River in 1798 called &quot;Great Landing&quot;. In 1805, founder Colonel Robert Johnson surveyed and built a road from this landing to his former home in Scott County, Kentucky. The landing soon became a busy shipping port.

In 1814, Colonel Johnson and Henry Yates purchased to establish a river town to be named &quot;Fredericksburg&quot;, after Johnson&#x27;s hometown in Virginia. By 1815, the town plot was complete. The town extended from the river to Market Street and included 172 numbered lots, each .

In 1831, the town was renamed as &quot;Warsaw&quot;, as the US Postal Service did not want it to have the same name as the Virginia city. The post office was established July 18, 1832, with W.F. Clinton as postmaster. In 1837, the Gallatin County seat was moved from Port William (now Carrollton) to Warsaw. The courthouse is now the oldest operating one in the state. The oldest home in Warsaw is the Henry Yates House, a home built of log construction circa 1809.

On December 4, 1868, 80 people died in the Ohio River steamboat collision of the &quot;United States&quot; and the &quot;America&quot; near Warsaw.

<text>Mayfield is a home rule–class city and the county seat of Graves County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 9,623 as of the 2024 United States Census.

==History==
===19th century===
Mayfield is in the center of the Jackson Purchase, an eight-county region purchased by Isaac Shelby and Andrew Jackson from the Chickasaw people in 1818. Mayfield was established as the county seat of Graves County in 1821, and the county was formally organized in 1823. John Anderson is believed to have been the first white settler, arriving in 1819 and building a log home on Mayfield Creek. In December 1821, Anderson was appointed county court clerk and moved about two and a half miles to the site that became Mayfield. According to Trabue Davis, the town&#x27;s name originates indirectly from a gambler named Mayfield, who was kidnapped about 1817 at a racetrack near what is now Hickman. He was carried to the site of today&#x27;s Mayfield, where he carved his name into a tree in hopes that someone would see it. He tried to escape but drowned trying to cross what is now called Mayfield Creek. The town took its name from the creek.

The completion of the Memphis, New Orleans, and Northern Railroad in 1858 connected Mayfield with the outside world. Beginning with the founding of the Mayfield Woolen Mills in 1860, manufacturing clothing became the main industry in Mayfield for the next hundred years. The town was also a major market for loose-leaf tobacco, and was part of the Black Patch, where Dark Fired Tobacco was processed.

During the Civil War, the Jackson Purchase area, including Mayfield, strongly supported the Confederate cause. It has been called &quot;Kentucky&#x27;s South Carolina&quot;. On May 29, 1861, a group of Southern sympathizers from Kentucky and Tennessee met at the Graves County Courthouse to discuss the possibility of joining the Jackson Purchase to West Tennessee. Most records of the event are lost, probably due to an 1887 fire that destroyed the courthouse.

===20th century===
In 1907, Fulton County judge Herbert Carr recalled that the Mayfield Convention adopted a resolution for secession. An historical marker in front of the Graves County courthouse now proclaims this as fact. However, records of the meeting kept by a Union sympathizer do not mention any such resolution. Historian Berry Craig argues that the convention believed Kentucky would eventually secede and a resolution to break away was unnecessary. Surviving records do show that the convention adopted resolutions condemning President Abraham Lincoln for &quot;waging a bloody and cruel war&quot; against the South, urging Gov. Beriah Magoffin to resist Union forces, and praising him for refusing to answer Lincoln&#x27;s demand for soldiers. They also condemned the Federal government for providing &quot;Lincoln guns&quot; to Union sympathizers in eastern Kentucky. The convention nominated Henry Burnett to represent Kentucky&#x27;s First District in Congress. The Mayfield Convention was followed by the Russellville Convention, which created the provisional Confederate government of Kentucky.

During and after Reconstruction, there was considerable white violence against blacks in the county. In one week in late December 1896, four black men were lynched in Mayfield. After Jim Stone was lynched, whites became fearful after hearing that blacks were arming to retaliate. They called for reinforcements from Fulton County, and fatally shot Will Suett, a young innocent black man getting off the train. The large white mob killed two more African-American men before the violence ended. Whites also burned four houses of African Americans.

During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, the local schools were slow to integrate, but they finally did so without violence. The &quot;Mayfield Ten&quot;, ten black students from the segregated Dunbar High School, were allowed to register in 1956 at all-white Mayfield High School.

===21st century===

In 2000, local resident Jessica Currin was murdered. The case was finally closed nearly seven years later with the help of a local amateur investigator named Susan Galbreath and Tom Mangold, a British journalist.

On May 10, 2016, an EF3 tornado passed just north of the city limits, resulting in ten injuries.

====December 2021 tornado outbreak====
During the evening of December 10, 2021, a destructive long-track tornado impacted areas of Kentucky including Mayfield, causing significant amounts of damage and leveling most of downtown.

The roof of Mayfield Consumer Products, a candle-making factory, collapsed during the tornado, with the fear that dozens died trapped within the building&#x27;s remnants. Estimates are that more than 100 employees were inside the factory when the tornado hit. By December 12, the company reported there had been eight deaths and eight remained missing. Many had gathered in a tornado shelter and left after the storm, and without power and phones they weren&#x27;t quickly located and accounted for. Workers filed a class-action lawsuit against their employer on December 16, after allegations by some workers that they were told they would be fired if they left work before the tornado hit. The allegations have been denied by the company.
==Geography==

==History==
The 1780 settlement was originally known as &quot;Glover&#x27;s Station&quot;, for local landowner John Glover, who received in the area as a military grant after the American Revolution.

Following the establishment of Green County (named for Revolutionary War Maj. General Nathanael Greene) from parts of Lincoln and Nelson counties in 1792, Greensburg was laid out and established two years later as its eponymous seat of government. It was incorporated as a city a year after that. The central Public Square was also laid out in 1795 and has been retained as designed since then, with the only changes being the paving of the square with concrete and the installation of concrete dividers in the four quadrants.

<text>Bellefonte is a home rule-class city in Greenup County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 888 at the 2010 census. Bellefonte is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). In 2013, according to new boundary definitions, the MSA had a population of 361,580.

Being primarily residential, Bellefonte is a suburb of nearby Ashland, to which it is closely connected. Known for having tree-lined streets and exclusively upscale neighborhoods, the city is home to the private Bellefonte Country Club, which has an 18-hole golf course, a swimming pool, tennis courts and a ballroom.

Bellefonte was first incorporated on July 3, 1951, beginning with only 275 residents, and developed in the latter half of the 20th century. The exclusive nature of the city is evident by its demographic makeup. Within the corporate limits, there are virtually no residents under the poverty line.

Nearby, Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital is named for its location, being just north of Bellefonte in Russell. In 1979, Ashland Inc. relocated its headquarters offices from Winchester Avenue in downtown Ashland to Russell near the hospital complex just north of Bellefonte. This modern business park complex was suitable for any Fortune 100 company such as Ashland, Inc. It comprised four glass office buildings: an executive building, two general office buildings and a combination warehouse/office building that contained printing presses and other service-type functions such as landscaping, etc. In 1999, the corporation moved its headquarters to Covington, Kentucky. Ashland, Inc. retained the office services building. The other structures, after a brief period as office facilities, were ultimately sold to nearby Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital, and are known as Bellefonte Centre and Bellefonte Pavilion, and are used for physicians&#x27; offices and clinics, hospital business offices, other hospital services and are rented to other businesses.

==Geography==
Bellefonte is located in eastern Greenup County at (38.493560, -82.688364). It is bordered to the north by the city of Russell and to the southeast by the unincorporated community of Westwood in Boyd County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.51%, is water. The city sits on a plateau northwest of Ashland, centered on Kentucky Route 5 and Country Club Drive. Route 5 terminates to the northeast at U.S. Route 23 near the Boyd/Greenup county line, and downtown Ashland is to the east.

The older section of what would become Bellefonte was laid out in town lots and sold, beginning in 1918, by the Means and Russell Iron Company. It was originally part of the several thousand-acre Wheatley farm. It was named after the iron furnace that was operated there from 1826 to 1893, named the Bellefonte Furnace. Some remnants of the old furnace remain today in Bellefonte, as its hand-cut limestone blocks are used as a retaining wall along Oxcart Road, near the Community Presbyterian Church, which is located on the original site of the iron furnace. The name &quot;Bellefonte&quot; is of French origin, a combination of the words &quot;belle&quot; for &#x27;beautiful&#x27; and &quot;fonte&quot; which has the meaning of &#x27;melting&#x27;, or in this case &#x27;foundry&#x27;, &#x27;forge&#x27; or &#x27;smelting&#x27;, referring to the iron furnace located there. A few of the original log-built dwellings from the 1800s iron furnace settlement remain along Route 5, but have been upgraded to upscale residential homes.

The city is located on a one-mile wide belt of relatively flat land that is approximately 100 feet higher in elevation than the nearby Ohio River valley. The unusual topography which is easily noticeable on topographical maps and aerial satellite imagery was created by the ancient Teays River. Larger than the Ohio River, the Teays cut a mile wide valley through the area before being filled with glacial silt during the ice age. This belt of flat land extends from Catlettsburg where it leaves the Ohio River north to near Wurtland and includes parts of Ashland, Westwood, Bellefonte, Russell and Flatwoods. The Ohio River came after the ice age in its current path which created another valley just northeast of Bellefonte. This entire belt of flat land was once known as The Flatwoods beginning in the mid-19th century. The name was retained when it was applied to the nearby city of Flatwoods, just northwest of Bellefonte.

<text>Flatwoods is a home rule-class city in Greenup County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 7,325 at the 2020 census, making it the largest city in Greenup County. Flatwoods is a part of the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area. Locally, Flatwoods is considered to be a bedroom community, as it has no large employer within the city. Many residents work for CSX Transportation, Marathon Petroleum, or King&#x27;s Daughters Medical Center.

==History==
The area now known as Flatwoods was originally named &quot;Advance&quot;: Advance Methodist Church formed a Sunday school beginning in 1860. The name was later changed to &quot;Cheap&quot;, after John Cheap, a blind clergyman. The original farming community returned to the name of &quot;Advance&quot; when a post office was established in 1918. In 1938, the post office was renamed &quot;Flatwoods&quot;, and the town was incorporated the same year under that name. Flatwoods is named for the area&#x27;s unique topography, a belt of flat wooded land in the ancient Teays River valley on an elevation of approximately or higher, just south of and higher than the Ohio River valley. The availability of flat level land and low tax rates made Flatwoods a local hot spot of new construction in the 1950s and 1960s, when many upper-middle-class tract housing developments were built and quickly inhabited. A main contributor to Flatwoods&#x27; growth was the fact that nearby Ashland had developed much of its available land prior to 1960, with little new construction possible within its corporation limits.

Flatwoods is located in eastern Greenup County, between Raceland to the northwest and Russell to the southeast. U.S. Route 23 (Seaton Avenue) forms the northeast border of Flatwoods; the highway leads southeast to Ashland and northwest to Greenup. According to the United States Census Bureau, Flatwoods has a total area of , all land.

The topography of Flatwoods is uncharacteristic to eastern Kentucky in that it consists of flat to rolling land on a single elevated hill. In eastern Kentucky, the dissected plateau landscape often referred to as &quot;hill and valley&quot; is standard terrain for the surrounding region. The flat terrain found in Flatwoods was created when it was the river bed of the ancient Teays River, which traveled through the area in prehistoric times, much larger than the Ohio River that now passes through the region.

Greenup was laid out in 1803 and 1804 by Robert Johnson, a pioneer and legislator who owned the land. Upon the formation of Greenup County (named for the former congressman Christopher Greenup, who later served as governor) out of land separated from Mason County, Johnson&#x27;s settlement was chosen to be the seat of government and adopted the name &quot;Greenupsburg&quot;. Its post office was erected on July 1, 1811. The state assembly formally established the town on February 4, 1818, and incorporated the city thirty years later on February 29, 1848. The name was shortened to &quot;Greenup&quot; on March 13, 1872, partially to avoid confusion with Greensburg.

Around 1865 the Eastern Kentucky Railway Company established its headquarters, rail yard, and depot at Riverton or eastern Greenup.

The Ohio River flood of 1937 brought devastation to Greenup and many other towns along the river. Some people left the area permanently, with the population of Greenup showing a decline of 5.5% in the 1940 census.

<doc id="115131" wikidata="Q2686934" url="?curid=115131" title="Russell, Kentucky">
<text>Russell is a home rule-class city on the south bank of the Ohio River in Greenup County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 3,380 as of the 2010 census, down from 3,645 in 2000. Russell is a suburb of Ashland and part of the Huntington-Ashland-Ironton metropolitan area. It has close economic affiliations with its neighbors, Ashland and Flatwoods in Kentucky and Ironton, Ohio.

==History==
The hilly site near the confluence of White Oak Creek and the Ohio was chosen by pioneer Jeff Moore in 1823 in order to provide protection for his camp against attacks by local American Indian tribes. In 1829, James E. McDowell, William Lindsay Poage, and his brother erected an iron furnace; they named the foundry and the community that grew up around it &quot;Amanda Furnace&quot; after William&#x27;s infant daughter. The furnace ceased operation in 1861.

John Russell and his Means and Russell Iron Company purchased the land of the present city beside Amanda Hill from the Poage brothers. They laid out and established the town of Riverview in 1869 in expectation of an expansion of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad westward from Huntington, West Virginia, to Cincinnati, Ohio. Ferry service to Ohio began in 1870, local landowners agreed to rename the community after its founder in 1873, and the city was formally incorporated under the name &quot;Russell&quot; in 1874. The expected C&amp;O spur did not arrive until 1889 but, when it did, it constructed a railyard, roundhouse, and shops and the city grew quickly. The city celebrates this influence with the annual &quot;Russell Railroad Days&quot; each August.

Numerous disasters limited the city&#x27;s growth. The Ohio River flooded the city in 1884, smallpox struck in 1901, and a fire consumed downtown and the city hall in 1903. In 1905, it was still the largest city in Greenup County, but the Ohio flooded again in 1913 and 1937. The 1937 flood affected all but 30 homes, and over 500 people were forced to shelter in C&amp;O boxcars and cabooses until the waters receded. Despite the completion of a bridge to Ironton in 1922 and a floodwall in 1950, Russell was no longer the county&#x27;s largest municipality by the mid-1950s.

The Fortune 500 company Ashland Oil relocated its headquarters to Russell in 1974, but moved to the Cincinnati suburb of Covington in 1999.

==Economy==

===Industrial===
Part of AK Steel&#x27;s Ashland Works is located in Russell. Russell was also once home to the headquarters of Ashland Global, a diversified chemical company. The two-building headquarters was located on Kentucky Route 1725 (Ashland Drive), with another facility on KY 693 (Diederich Boulevard). The company has since relocated to Covington. One of the buildings was purchased by Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital and was known as &quot;Bellefonte Pavilion&quot; during the hospital&#x27;s ownership. That building is now owned by Ashland-based King&#x27;s Daughters Medical Center, has been renamed &quot;King&#x27;s Daughters Pavilion&quot; and houses many of the hospital&#x27;s business offices. The other building, which was named &quot;Bellefonte Centre&quot;, is privately owned and is used as physician and clinic offices along with rental office space.

===Transportation===
The city has a large railroad classification yard, built by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and now owned and operated by CSX Transportation. The C&amp;O Rail Yard was formerly the largest individually-owned rail yard in the world.

Vehicles may cross the Ohio River via the Ironton–Russell Bridge or the Ben Williamson Memorial Bridge in Ashland. A new Ironton-Russell Bridge, opened in 2016, connects downtown Ironton with U.S. 23 and KY 244 just south of downtown Russell. The original Ironton-Russell Bridge, which connected downtown Ironton directly with Willow Street in downtown Russell, opened in 1922, closed when the new bridge opened in 2016 and was demolished in late 2016–early 2017.

===Medical===
Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital was a 214-bed not-for-profit acute care hospital located in Russell from 1953 to 2020. The hospital was part of the Catholic-based Bon Secours Health System Inc. Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital employed approximately 1,200 healthcare professionals, making the hospital the largest employer in Greenup County when it was open.

==Education==
Russell&#x27;s students are served by Russell Independent Schools, which it shares with its neighbors, Flatwoods and Bellefonte. The main campus, which includes Russell High School, Russell Middle School, Russell Primary School and the Russell Area Technology Center, sits on the Russell/Flatwoods city line (all of the schools&#x27; mailing addresses are Russell, but they receive primary police and fire protection from Flatwoods).

The Russell High School football field is home to a fire-breathing Red Devil, the school&#x27;s mascot Rudy, who sits atop the scoreboard. Russell High School was the 1978 Kentucky State 3A football champion, as well as the 2005 Kentucky State 2A football champion.

<text>South Shore is a home rule-class city in Greenup County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 1,122 at the 2010 census, down from 1,226 in 2000. It is located along the Ohio River across from Portsmouth, Ohio, at the mouth of Tygarts Creek. South Shore is a part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).

The South Portsmouth–South Shore station serves Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Cardinal&quot; Trains 50 &amp; 51.

==History==

South Shore was first settled in 1890 by the Fullerton, Warnock, and the Morton families from the nearby Tygarts Valley. Significant development occurred after the coming of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and George D. Winn&#x27;s ferry to Portsmouth, Ohio, in the 1890s. Winn began to petition for a post office in 1893, and on July 21 the post office was established as &quot;Fullerton&quot;, after his brothers Harvey and Harrison Fullerton. The town was incorporated for a short period during 1919.

In 1895, the Taylor brickyard was established near Fullerton by Clyde King and became the area&#x27;s top employer. The Taylor name was applied to both the local railway station and the nearby McCall post office on January 16, 1930. This post office was then renamed &quot;South Shore&quot; on February 4, 1940. Shortly after the city of South Shore was incorporated on July 2, 1957, the Fullerton and South Shore post offices were consolidated under the South Shore name. South Shore eventually annexed the entire city of Fullerton, significantly expanding its boundaries.

==Geography==
South Shore is located in northern Greenup County at (38.721577, -82.963606), on the south bank of the Ohio River. U.S. Route 23 passes through the city limits, leading southeast to Greenup, the county seat, and to Ashland. To the west, US-23 leads to the south end of the U.S. Grant Bridge, which carries the highway across the Ohio River into Portsmouth.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of South Shore has a total area of , of which is land and , or 22.79%, is water.

<text>Lewisport is a home rule-class city in the floodplain of the Ohio River in Hancock County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 1,670 at the 2010 census, and is also the most populous community in the county. It is included in the Owensboro metropolitan area.

==History==
Lewisport was originally a ferry landing site known as &quot;Little Yellow Banks&quot;, in allusion to Owensboro&#x27;s original name of &quot;Yellow Banks&quot;. The first settler was James Prentis, who platted the current town in 1837 with his brother John. An attempt to rename the city &quot;Prentisport&quot; failed, though, when James insisted the town be named after his friend Dr. John Lewis instead. The town was chartered as &quot;Lewisport&quot; in 1839, and the post office was established under that name in 1844. The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly the same year, but needed to be reincorporated in 1882.

Logging and flatboat construction were the initial chief industries. The river has flooded the city repeatedly, and the importance of lumber construction and industry has sparked several major fires.

Abraham Lincoln won his first case – &quot;Commonwealth of Kentucky v. Abraham Lincoln&quot; – in Lewisport&#x27;s Pate House, at the time the site of the local circuit court. He was tried in the east room of the log house before Squire Pate for operating a ferry across the Ohio River without a license, but the justice of the peace dismissed the case against him. The house is now a county landmark and is open for tours throughout the year.

During the Civil War, Bill Davison and Isaac Coulter captured and robbed the steamship &quot;Morning Star&quot; here on December 23, 1864, killing three Union soldiers. The town&#x27;s only bank was shuttered during the Great Depression. Upon its founding in 1938, the Lewisport School System comprised eight local one-room schools; today it is part of the Hancock County Consolidated School System.

==Geography==
Lewisport is located in northwestern Hancock County at (37.935023, -86.905270), on the south bank of the Ohio River. The closest river crossings are by road to the east, at Hawesville, and the same distance to the west, at U.S. Route 231 near Rockport, Indiana. U.S. Route 60 passes east–west through the southern end of Lewisport. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Elizabethtown is a home rule-class city and the county seat of Hardin County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 28,531 at the 2010 census, and was estimated at 31,394 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2020, making it the ninth-most populous city in the state. It is included in (and the principal city of) the Elizabethtown–Fort Knox, Kentucky Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Louisville/Jefferson County–Elizabethtown–Madison, Kentucky-Indiana Combined Statistical Area. The Elizabethtown Metropolitan area had a 2019 estimated population of 153,057, making it the 5th-largest metropolitan area in the state.

==History==
Established in 1793, Hardin County was named for Colonel John Hardin, an Indian fighter who worked with tribes in the local area. In a few years, professional men and tradesmen came to live in the area. In 1793, Colonel Andrew Hynes had (until then known as the &quot;Severn&#x27;s Valley Settlement&quot;) surveyed and laid off into lots and streets to establish Elizabethtown. Named in honor of his wife, Elizabethtown was legally established in 1797.

Thomas Lincoln helped Samuel Haycraft build a millrace at Haycraft&#x27;s mill on Valley Creek. After Lincoln married Nancy Hanks in 1806, they lived in a log cabin built in Elizabethtown. Their daughter, Sarah, was born there in 1807. Soon after, they moved to the Sinking Spring Farm, where Abraham Lincoln was born in 1809. Thomas Lincoln took his family to Indiana in 1816. After his wife died in 1818, he returned to Elizabethtown and married Sarah Bush Johnston, widowed since 1816. She and her three children accompanied Thomas back to Indiana, where Sarah was stepmother to Thomas&#x27; two children.

On March 5, 1850, the Commonwealth of Kentucky granted a charter to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company authorizing it to raise funds and built a railroad from Louisville to the Tennessee state line in the direction of Nashville. John L. Helm, the grandson of Capt. Thomas Helm, became the president of the railroad in October 1854; he directed construction of the main stem of the rail line through Elizabethtown. The rail line was completed to Elizabethtown in 1858, with the first train arriving on June 15, 1858. The opening of the railroad brought economic growth to Elizabethtown, which became an important trade center along the railroad and a strategic point during the Civil War.

On December 27, 1862, Confederate General John Hunt Morgan and his 3,000-man cavalry attacked Elizabethtown. During the battle, more than 100 cannonballs were fired into the town. Although he successfully captured Elizabethtown, Morgan&#x27;s chief goal was to disrupt the railroad and northern transportation. He proceeded north along the railroad, burning trestles and destroying sections of the track. After the battle, one cannonball was found lodged in the side of a building on the public square. After the building burned in 1887 and was rebuilt, the cannonball was replaced in the side wall, as close to its original site as possible, where it remains in the present day. It is located in the Joey Lee building, which is located on the historic town square. The building is currently owned and houses the office of attorney Roger T. Rigney, it also features a plaquard noting the cannonball and the history behind it out front.

From 1871 to 1873 during the Reconstruction Era, the Seventh Cavalry and a battalion of the Fourth Infantry, led by General George Armstrong Custer, were stationed in Elizabethtown. The military were assigned to suppress the local Ku Klux Klan under the Enforcement Acts, as their members had been attacking freedmen and other Republicans. They also broke up illegal distilleries, which began to flourish in the South after the Civil War. General Custer and his wife Elizabeth lived in a small cottage behind Aunt Beck Hill&#x27;s boarding house, now known as the Brown-Pusey House.

The town is regionally referred to as &quot;E-town&quot; (sometimes with an apostrophe in place of the dash). It is one of two larger towns (the other being Bowling Green, Kentucky) along I-65 between Louisville and Nashville. The movie &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; (2005) was named after the town; most of the footage was filmed in Versailles and Louisville because Elizabethtown has lost much of its historic architecture in recent years due to commercial development.

===Alcohol sales===
Elizabethtown is officially classified by the Kentucky Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) as being in a &quot;moist county&quot;. Under ABC terminology, &quot;moist&quot; indicates that at least one city within a county has approved packaged alcohol sales. In popular usage, the term &quot;moist&quot; more often refers to the city&#x27;s former status as allowing by-the-drink sales in restaurants, but not package sales.

Despite the county being a dry county, alcoholic drink sales have long been allowed in restaurants seating at least 100 diners and deriving at least 70% of their total sales from food. Beer, wine and spirits can be purchased at licensed liquor stores, drug stores and grocery outlets, beer can be purchased at most convenience stores . The locals classify this as a &quot;damp&quot; or &quot;moist&quot; county. In 2011, the residents of Elizabethtown, Radcliff, and Vine Grove voted to allow properly licensed businesses to sell package liquor, wine, and beer.

==Transportation==
The city is served by the Elizabethtown Regional Airport (EKX), and the Elizabethtown Airport Board was as of 2013 exploring options to bring commercial services to the city.

<text>Radcliff is a home rule-class city in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 23,042 as of the 2020 Census, up from 21,692 from the 2010 census.

Its economy is largely dominated by the adjacent U.S. Army base Fort Knox and by the nearby city of Elizabethtown. Radcliff&#x27;s population previously fluctuated greatly depending on the deployments of the units at the base, but the BRAC reorganization of 2005, and the quartering of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Human Resources Command to Fort Knox has created a larger and more stable population.

==Geography==
Radcliff is in northern Hardin County at (37.829918, -85.945541). It is bordered to the north by Fort Knox and to the west by Vine Grove. U.S. Route 31W runs through the east side of the city, leading north to Louisville and south to Elizabethtown.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Radcliff has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.25%, are water.

The former unincorporated community of Rogersville, named for a local family, is in the southern part of Radcliff along US 31W and Kentucky Route 447.

==History==

Incorporated in 1956, Radcliff was first settled in 1919, when Horace McCullum subdivided lots along Wilson Avenue and sold them at auction to the highest bidder. McCullum named the new community after Major William Radcliffe, head of the Quartermaster Corps at the newly established Camp Henry Knox. After selling the general store he had opened in the new town, McCullum no longer played a role in its development.

The next significant step in Radcliff&#x27;s history took place during the 1930s when Fort Knox expanded and dislocated the towns of Stithton and New Stithton, causing various residents and businesses of those communities to move to Radcliff. During World War II, thousands of soldiers trained at Fort Knox and spent their leisure hours at the USO in Radcliff.

Hardin Water District No. 1 was formed in 1953, and became a reality in 1955 with the sale of bonds to finance the project. Today, the water district is the principal source of fresh water to all Hardin County. Radcliff&#x27;s fire department was established in 1955, with Joseph B. Hutcherson the first fire chief. The Radcliff Civic Club was also organized that year. The city incorporated in March 1956 as a 6th-class city. Radcliff Police Department was formed with officers paid on a fee basis. The population was estimated at 800. Radcliff&#x27;s population growth over the last 50 years is due to the transient military population, and trends are showing a plateau and decline. At one time, Radcliff was larger than Elizabethtown, but that was short-lived after the 2000 census and more so after the BRAC transformation at the beginning of the 21st century. Starting with 800 in 1956, the Census Bureau reported populations of 3,381 in 1960, 8,281 in 1970, 14,519 in 1980, and 21,961 in 2000.

In 1988, a youth group from the First Assembly of God in Radcliff was involved in the worst drunk-driving incident in U.S. history, a bus collision in which a drunk driver going the wrong way on Interstate 71 hit the group&#x27;s vehicle, killing 27 people.

In mid-October 2011, the city voted to approve alcohol sales, which began in January 2012.

Former Kentucky state representative Mike Weaver was elected mayor in 2014 and took office in 2015 for a four-year term. City council members Barbara Baker, Stan Holmes, Edward L. Palmer, T. W. Shortt, Kim Thompson and Chris Yates were also elected in 2014 and took office in 2015, each for a two-year term.

The November 8, 2016, general election for Radcliff City Council ended with all current councilmembers reelected except Shortt, who had run for Kentucky State Representative. Radcliff community leader and businesswoman Tanya Seabrooks was elected to fill the seat Shortt vacated, defeating five other candidates. She took the oath of office in December 2016 for a two-year term. Shortt was defeated in his bid for state representative by the incumbent, Dean Schamore.

In the 2020 general election for the City Council, all but two incumbent members of the city council were re-elected. Barbara Baker lost her seat after finishing eighth in the race and Edward Palmer decided not to run for re-election. The two newly elected to the council were Terry Owens who finished second and Toshie Murrell who finished fifth. Incumbent Tanya Seabrooks was re-elected, having finished fourth, but died a month after the election. In a special-called meeting on January 7, 2021, the city council unanimously appointed Aundra Lett Jackson, who finished seventh in the race, as the council&#x27;s sixth member to serve Seabrooks&#x27; term.

The 2022 election for the Radcliff City Council saw incumbents Terry Owens, Kim Thompson, Pamela DeRoche, and Toshie Murrell win re-election. Chris Yates did not run for another term on the city council, instead running as a Democratic Party candidate in the magisterial election for the first district of the Hardin County fiscal court, where he defeated independent candidate Edward Palmer. Aundra Lett Jackson did not win enough votes to secure a second term. Jerry Brown, who had previously served five terms as a member of the city council, and Michelle Harmon, an owner of an ice cream shop and a volunteer in the community, won seats on the city council. Brown and Harmon were sworn in as members of the City Council on December 20, 2022.

The 2024 election resulted in five of the six incumbents winning their bids for re-election, with Toshie Murrell winning first, followed by Terry Owens in second, Kim Thompson third, Pam DeRoche fourth, and Jerry Brown sixth. The sole incumbent to fail to win re-election was Michelle Mitchell, who finished seventh. Local chef and volunteer Maria Bell finished fifth, winning her a spot on the city council.

<doc id="115141" wikidata="Q2235649" url="?curid=115141" title="West Point, Kentucky">
<text>West Point is a home rule-class city in Hardin County, Kentucky, United States, near the edge of Fort Knox military reservation on Dixie Highway. It is located in a former meander bend of the Ohio River. The population was 952 as of the 2020 Census, up from 797 from the 2010 census, but still down from 1,100 at the 2000 census.

West Point is part of the Elizabethtown–Fort Knox Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
West Point was founded by pioneer James Young, who built a cabin at the site in 1789 and, in 1797, built a brick house and inn that is still standing today. In 1803, Lewis and Clark passed nearby and recruited West Point citizen John Shields to join their Corps of Discovery.

West Point sits at the confluence of the Ohio and Salt rivers, a strategic position that led Union forces to construct a fort here during the Civil War to protect their supply routes. Fort Duffield is the state&#x27;s largest and best-preserved earthen fortification from the period.

West Point also retains many of its other historic resources, and a large portion of the community is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.

One of the newest preservation projects in West Point is the rehabilitation of the West Point Independent Colored School (1926), one of the &quot;Rosenwald Schools&quot; built by philanthropist Julius Rosenwald to educate African-Americans in rural areas. Plans call for using the one-room school as a visitor, educational, and research facility.

West Point commemorated the bicentennial of Lewis and Clark&#x27;s visit with a heritage festival that celebrated local history and drew heritage tourists. Year-round, Fort Duffield is an important tourist destination, and the city recently secured a grant to fund walking trails at the site.

West Point was a childhood residence of the late Louisiana Governor James A. Noe Sr., a wealthy oilman and landowner.

==Geography==

Fort Duffield Park is located in the southern part of the city, with the remains of the fort sitting on top of a hill that rises above the downtown. The city is bordered to the south by the northern end of Fort Knox.

On January 28, 2020, the West Point Independent Schools Board of Education voted unanimously to begin merger negotiations with Hardin County Schools; the West Point board approved the merger on February 18 and the Hardin County board followed two days later. The merger took effect on July 1, 2020. The relocation of students sent kindergarten students to North Park Elementary, first through fifth grades to Vine Grove Elementary, and sixth through eighth grade to J.T. Alton Middle School. Students who attended Elizabethtown High before the merger completed their high school there, while West Point high school students after the meger attend North Hardin High School.
==In popular culture==
West Point and neighboring town Muldraugh are featured in the open world survival horror game &quot;Project Zomboid&quot; as spawn points and explorable locations. The nearby city of Louisville is also featured in the game. For the sake of in-game difficulty, the infected population is far more abundant than the population of West Point during the year in which the game takes place. Spawning in West Point is not recommended for new or intermediate players due to the sheer amount of undead that litter the town relative to its small size, making it a challenging spawn location for advanced players.

Blackjewel was founded in 2017, and it was one of the largest coal mining companies in the country. Its bankruptcy filing also affected employees in Virginia and Wyoming; in total about 1700 miners have been affected.

<text>Harlan is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Harlan County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 1,745 at the 2010 census, down from 2,081 at the 2000 census.

Harlan is one of three Kentucky county seats to share its name with its county, the others being Greenup and Henderson.

==History==

Harlan was first settled by Samuel and Chloe Howard in 1796. Upon the founding of Harlan County (named for Kentucky pioneer Silas Harlan) in 1819, the Howards donated of land to serve as the county seat. The community there was already known as &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;, apparently owing to a nearby Indian mound. A post office was established on September 19, 1828, but called &quot;Harlan Court House&quot; due to another Mt. Pleasant preempting that name. During the Civil War, Confederate raiders under Gen. Humphrey Marshall occupied the town; the local postmaster renamed the community &quot;Spurlock&quot; after himself; and, in October 1863, the courthouse was burnt down in reprisal for the Union destruction of the courthouse in Lee County, Virginia. In 1865, the post office was renamed &quot;Harlan&quot; and, although the community was formally incorporated by the state assembly as &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot; on April 15, 1884, the town was already usually called &quot;Harlan Court House&quot; or &quot;Harlan Town&quot; by its inhabitants. The city&#x27;s terms of incorporation were amended to change the name to &quot;Harlan&quot; on March 13, 1912. One year before, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad had arrived in Harlan and prompted massive growth. The city had initially expanded east along the Clover Fork; after World War II, it also expanded south along Martin&#x27;s Fork.

Harlan is the site of a criminal case in which a man, Condy Dabney, was convicted in 1924 of murdering a person who was later found alive.

A flood in 1977 prompted federal aid that diverted the Clover Fork into man-made tunnels under Ivy Hill in 1989. In the 1990s, a flood wall was completed on the city&#x27;s west side along the four-lane bypass U.S. Route 421.

==Geography==

Harlan is located in west-central Harlan County at (36.841487, -83.320066), at the junction of the Clover Fork and Martin&#x27;s Fork rivers. The Clover Fork continues north to join the Poor Fork, forming the Cumberland River, a major tributary of the Ohio River. Harlan is in a narrow mountain valley, constrained to the north by the western end of Black Mountain, to the south by Little Black Mountain, and to the west by Ewing Spur. The elevation at the Harlan Courthouse is above sea level, while the surrounding ridges rise outside the city limits to (Black Mountain), (Little Black Mountain), and (Ewing Spur).

U.S. Route 421 passes through the city as four-lane highway; it leads north to Hyden and southeast to Pennington Gap, Virginia. The closest city with a population greater than 10,000 is Middlesboro, Kentucky, to the southeast via U.S. Routes 119 and 25E.

Some storylines of the FX Networks drama &quot;Justified&quot; take place in Harlan, although no scenes have been filmed there. The 2012–13 National Geographic series &quot;Kentucky Justice&quot; which followed the Harlan County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in their daily duties was filmed in Harlan and Harlan County. Parts of the OxyContin scandal series “Dopesick” also take part in Harlan County.

Harlan was also featured in the Darrell Scott song &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Leave Harlan Alive&quot; (later performed by Brad Paisley, Patty Loveless and in 2019 by Montgomery Gentry on the CD &quot;Outskirts&quot;), the Steve Earle song &quot;Harlan Man&quot;, the Anna McGarrigle song &quot;Goin&#x27; Back to Harlan&quot; (notably covered by Emmylou Harris), the song &quot;Harlan County Line&quot; from Dave Alvin, and the Tyler Childers song “Harlan Road”.

&quot;Harlan County, USA&quot; is a documentary about the coal miners&#x27; strike against the Brookside Mine of the Eastover Mining Company in Harlan County in June 1973. Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between company personnel and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk. Director Barbara Kopple puts the strike into perspective by giving us some background on the historical plight of the miners and some history of the UMWA. It won an Oscar for Best Documentary in 1977. This is one of the reasons it is called &quot;Bloody Harlan&quot;.
