<text>St. Martinville () is a city in and the parish seat of St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, United States. It lies on Bayou Teche, south of Breaux Bridge, southeast of Lafayette, and north of New Iberia. The population was 6,114 at the 2010 U.S. census, and 5,379 at the 2020 United States census. It is part of the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
In the 16th century, the area between the Atchafalaya River, in Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico and Trinity River, in Texas, was occupied by numerous tribes or subdivisions of the Attakapan people. The territory was not closed to outsiders, and several traders roamed through it on business.

Europeans did not begin to settle there until French explorers claimed and founded the colony of Louisiana in 1699. They referred to the territory between the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Nezpique, where the Eastern Atakapa lived, as the Attakapas Territory, adopting the name from the Choctaw language term for this people. The French colonial government gave land away to French soldiers and settlers.

&quot;Poste des Atakapas&quot; (Attakapas Post) was founded as a trading post on the banks of the Bayou Teche, and settlers started to arrive. Some came separately from France, such as M. Masse, who came about 1754 from Grenoble. Gabriel Fuselier de la Claire, a Frenchman from Lyon, and some other Frenchmen from Mobile, in present-day Alabama, arrived in late 1763 or early 1764. Fuselier bought land between Vermilion River and Bayou Teche from the Eastern Attakapas chief Kinemo. Shortly after that, the rival Appalousa (Opelousas) invaded the area via the Atchafalaya and Sabine rivers, and exterminated much of the Eastern Atakapan. Gabriel Fuselier&#x27;s son Agricole Fuselier was prominent in settling what developed as New Iberia, Louisiana.

Gradually groups of more French speakers arrived, such as the first Acadians from Nova Scotia. They were assigned to this area in 1765 by Jean-Jacques Blaise d&#x27;Abbadie, the French official who was administering Louisiana for the Spanish. They had been expelled from Acadia by the British, who had defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War and taken over its territories in North America east of the Mississippi River. Spain took over Louisiana and other territories west of the Mississippi but tended to rely on French colonists to administer &quot;La Louisiane&quot;.

The Acadians were led by Joseph Broussard. In 1768-1769, fifteen families arrived from Pointe Coupee, another French colonial community. Their members had migrated from Saint-Domingue (now Haïti) or from Paris via Fort de Chartres, in present-day Illinois. Between the arrivals of the two groups, the French captain Étienne de Vaugine came in 1764 and acquired a large domain east of Bayou Teche.

On April 25, 1766, after the arrival of the first Acadians, the census showed a population of 409 inhabitants for the Attakapas region. In 1767, the Attakapas Post had 150 inhabitants before the arrival of the 15 families from Pointe Coupee.

In 1803, after losing his effort to regain control over Saint-Domingue during its slave revolt, Napoleon sold Louisiana in 1803 to the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. The U.S. settlers and territorial government organized the Attakapas Territory between 1807 and 1868. After Louisiana became a state, Saint Martin Parish was created. Attakapas Post was renamed as Saint Martinville and designated as the parish seat.

In 1867, Governor Benjamin Flanders appointed Monroe Baker as mayor who was one of the earliest if not the first African-American mayor to serve in the United States.

Once New Orleans was founded and began to have epidemics, some New Orleanians escaped the city and came to St. Martinville. Its nickname, &quot;Petit Paris&quot; (&quot;Little Paris&quot;), dates from the era when St. Martinville was known as a cultural mecca with good hotels and a French theater, the Duchamp Opera House (founded in 1830), which featured the best operas and witty comedies.

The third oldest town in Louisiana, St. Martinville has many buildings and homes with historic architecture. The historic St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church and La Maison Duchamp on Main Street are part of the legacy of the Acadian people. The church was dedicated to Martin of Tours in France, where a St Martin de Tours church can be found. St. Martinville is the site of the &quot;Evangeline Oak&quot;, featured in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s poem about the Acadian expulsion.

The city houses an African American Museum and is a posted destination on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail, which was established in 2008.

<text>Charenton (historically ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,903 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Morgan City Micropolitan Statistical Area. 

== History ==

Charenton is home to one community of Chitimacha people. In 1855, the Chitimacha were seriously reduced by yellow fever that struck the region. In 1881, the Chitimacha were located on Grand Lake or Lake Fausse. The census of 1900 listed six families of Chitimacha, with a total of 55 people. During this period, the Chitimacha&#x27;s land base had continued to decline as reservation land was divided again and again among members unable to pay the annual taxes. As a result, the land was sold. A court divided the last of the reservation in 1903, but attorney&#x27;s fees claimed of it two years later. Answering a plea from the Chitimacha women, Miss Sarah Avery McIlhenney purchased the land at a sheriff&#x27;s sale in 1915 and immediately ceded it to the federal government who in turn placed the land in trust for the tribe. Federal recognition followed in 1917, and the Chitimacha became the only tribe in Louisiana to achieve such status. This new recognition and the land held in trust could not have come at a better time. World War I and the pressure it placed on oil companies led to exploration in the region and purchase of land there.

With their land secure, many Chitimacha found employment in the new Louisiana oil fields as drillers and foremen. Following the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934, the Chitimacha created a new tribal organization. Unfortunately, their small enrollment and success in finding work outside their reservation led to an attempt by the government to terminate their federal status in 1952. This move was ultimately defeated, and the Chitimacha, growing in number and organization, put into effect a constitution and bylaws in 1971 that remain in effect today.

The Chitimacha operate a museum, fish processing plant and school on the reservation. In addition, what began as a bingo operation grew into a lucrative casino that operates on the tribe&#x27;s land in Charenton. Revenue from the Cypress Bayou casino has provided the Chitimacha with funds used to recover land historically part of the reservation. Consequently, land that had dwindled to just has now swelled to over a thousand acres (4 km). The Chitimacha are an important part of Charenton&#x27;s history as well as a major part of the current community.

==Geography==
Charenton is located at (29.88436373442272,-91.5274459771368).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.79%, is water.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,699 people, 665 households, and 414 families residing in the CDP.

==Education==
The Chitimacha Tribal School, a K-8 school, is affiliated with the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). It is in Charenton.

In 1937 a two classroom public school building condemned by the St. Mary Parish School Board was moved to Charenton, and began serving the community as a 1-8 school; the student population went over 60. In 1968 the kindergarten was established. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) built a new school, which began operations in 1978, to replace the former facility. It had 38 in the 1978-1979 school year, but this went down to 29 in 1980-1981 and 22 in 1981-1982. In 1982 it got a funding cut due to Reaganomics, which led to fears that the school could close.

St. Mary Parish School Board operates local public schools.

<doc id="115771" wikidata="Q2439804" url="?curid=115771" title="Franklin, Louisiana">
<text>Franklin is a small city in and the parish seat of St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 6,229 as of 2024. The city is located on Bayou Teche, southeast of the cities of Lafayette, and New Iberia, , and northwest of Morgan City. It is part of the Morgan City Micropolitan Statistical Area and the larger Lafayette-Acadiana combined statistical area.

==History==
Franklin, named for Benjamin Franklin, was founded in 1808 as the &quot;Carlin&#x27;s Settlement&quot; by French-born pioneer Joseph Carlin and his family. It became the parish seat in 1811 and the town was incorporated in 1820. Though early settlers included French, Acadian, German, Danish and Irish, the town&#x27;s culture and architecture is heavily influenced by the unusually large numbers of English that chose to settle there after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

Numerous large sugar plantations arose in the area, and with the development of steam-boating, Franklin became an interior sugar port. With the later advent of the railroad, it became a sawmill town.

Franklin&#x27;s First United Methodist Church was established in 1806, making it the first Protestant church established in the state of Louisiana.

===Sugar plantations===
By the 1830s, Bayou Teche was the main street of Acadiana, with one plantation after another. The area&#x27;s sugar cane planters were among the South&#x27;s wealthiest agriculturists. This is reflected in the grand plantation homes and mansions they built in Franklin and the surrounding countryside. Most of these magnificent structures are still standing and well preserved, giving Franklin its unique architectural flavor.

Franklin&#x27;s Historic District is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and encompasses over 420 notable structures. Some of the historic plantations in Franklin listed in the NRHP include the Alice C. Plantation House, Arlington Plantation House, and the Dixie Plantation House.

===Civil War===
During the Civil War, the Battle of Irish Bend, also known as Nerson&#x27;s Woods, was fought near Franklin on April 14, 1863. Though eventually forced to retreat, the badly outnumbered Confederate forces commanded by General Richard Taylor cost the Union troops, under General Cuvier Grover, significant losses. Four hundred men were killed or wounded in the confrontation, including Confederate Colonel James Reily, a factor in halting the Union drive to invade Texas.

==Geography==
Franklin is located at (29.791759, -91.508253) and has an elevation of .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.44%, is water.

<doc id="115772" wikidata="Q1021427" url="?curid=115772" title="Morgan City, Louisiana">
<text>Morgan City is a small city in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, United States, located in the Acadiana region. The population was 11,472 at the 2020 census. Known for being &quot;right in the middle of everywhere&quot;, Morgan City is located southeast of Lafayette, south of Baton Rouge, and west of New Orleans.

Morgan City sits on the banks of the Atchafalaya River near its intersection with the Intracoastal Waterway. The town was originally named &quot;Tiger Island&quot; by surveyors appointed by U.S. Secretary of War John Calhoun, because of a particular type of wild cat seen in the area. It was later changed for a time to &quot;Brashear City&quot;, named after Walter Brashear, a prominent Kentucky physician who had purchased large tracts of land and acquired numerous sugar mills in the area. It was incorporated in 1860.

Morgan City, and all of St. Mary Parish, is included in the Lafayette-Opelousas-Morgan City CSA.

==History==
===Capture of Brashear City===
During the American Civil War, the Star Fort of Fort Brashear was the larger of two works erected by the Union Army occupying the city to defend a Federal military depot and the town. During the Bayou Teche Campaign, on the night of June 22, 1863, 325 Confederates of Gen. A. A. Mouton&#x27;s command, led by Major Sherod Hunter, landed their skiffs and flats in the rear of the town. Attacking the next day, they surprised and captured the city, taking 1,300 Union prisoners, 11 heavy siege guns, 2,500 stands of rifles, immense quantities of quartermaster, commissary and ordnance stores. They also captured 2,000 African Americans, between 200 and 300 wagons and tents, all while suffering losses of only three killed, 18 wounded.

===Morgan City===

In 1876, the community&#x27;s name was changed to Morgan City in tribute to Charles Morgan, a rail and steamship magnate who first dredged the Atchafalaya Bay Ship Channel to accommodate ocean-going vessels.

On September 11, 1961, an F2 tornado struck the city, causing heavy damage to the city and injuring 16 people.

On October 28, 1985, Hurricane Juan (not to be confused with the 2003 storm of the same name) made landfall near Morgan City, flooding many parts of the city. The storm then looped offshore and came onshore again in Alabama.

On August 26, 1992, Hurricane Andrew came ashore to the southwest of Morgan City. Andrew was the second most destructive hurricane in U.S. history, crossing Florida and then regaining strength in the Gulf of Mexico before it struck Louisiana.

In 2019, Morgan City and the surrounding area were selected as a setting for the paranormal-themed reality TV show &quot;Ghosts of Morgan City&quot;, broadcast on the Travel Channel.
On July 13, 2019 Hurricane Barry made landfall west of Morgan City as a Category 1 Hurricane on the Saffir Simpson Scale.

===Agricultural===
A type of blackberry deemed the youngberry was developed by B.M. Young in 1905 in Morgan City, as a hybrid between a variety of blackberries. The youngberry is a cross between Luther Burbank&#x27;s Phenomenal Berry and the Austin-Mayes dewberry, a trailing blackberry. The youngberry was introduced commercially in 1926 and quickly came to rival the loganberry. The youngberry had excellent qualities, such as taste and high yields and it soon replaced the loganberry of California.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.03%, is water.

The northeastern border of Morgan City is at the lower St. Martin Parish line via Louisiana Highway 70.

U.S. Highway 90 (future Interstate 49) and Louisiana Highway 182 both pass through the city, both heading west to Lafayette. U.S. 90 also heads east approximately to New Orleans, while passing in between the cities of Houma, which is located approximately southeast, and Thibodaux, which is located northeast of Morgan City. U.S. 90 is a freeway between Morgan City and the Houma area with the route planned to become a section of future Interstate 49.

Morgan City is served by the Harry P. Williams Memorial Airport, a general aviation airfield located near the U.S. 90 four lane highway in nearby Patterson, Louisiana.

If the Mississippi River were to experience a major course change in the vicinity of the Old River Control Structure or Morganza Spillway, the main channel of the river would likely then enter the Gulf of Mexico near Morgan City instead of New Orleans.

<doc id="115776" wikidata="Q1014171" url="?curid=115776" title="Covington, Louisiana">
<text>Covington is a city in and the parish seat of St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 11,564 at the 2020 United States census. It is located at a fork of the Bogue Falaya and the Tchefuncte River. Covington is part of the Slidell-Mandeville-Covington statistical area.

==History==
The earliest known settlement by Europeans in the area was in 1800 by Jacques Drieux, during the British West Florida period.

In 1813, John Wharton Collins established a town with the name of Wharton. He is buried on the corner of the city cemetery directly across from the Covington Police Department. On March 11, 1816, the town of Wharton was renamed as Covington. There are conflicting stories about how the city came to be named Covington. Many historians believe the city was renamed for General Leonard Covington, a hero of the War of 1812. Covington was killed late in 1813, having established his home in the Mississippi Territory.

Local historian Judge Steve Ellis floats another theory centered on the suggestion by Jesse Jones, a local attorney, that the city be named in honor of the Blue Grass whiskey (made in Covington, Kentucky) enjoyed by town officials. In any case, Leonard Covington is the namesake of both towns.

Originally, commerce was brought to Covington via boat up the Bogue Falaya River, which used the Tchefuncte River as a means of passage to and from Lake Pontchartrain. Then in 1888, the railroad came to town. Much of the former railroad right-of-way is now occupied by the Tammany Trace, a 31-mile bike trail running east and west through several communities on the north side of Lake Pontchartrain.

In the late 20th century, with the expansion of Louisiana&#x27;s road system, many people who worked in New Orleans moved to Covington, commuting to work via the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. With the expansion of the interstate system, Covington experienced a boom of growth. Many people moved to the Northshore for more affordable housing, larger lot size, and a small-town feeling. This is considered to be associated with white flight out of New Orleans, though the Jefferson Parish area had the most expansion during that period.

<text>Madisonville is a town in St. Tammany Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The population was 748 at the 2010 U.S. census, and 850 at the 2020 U.S. census. It is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area. The ZIP code is 70447.

== History ==
Madisonville was founded by Jean Baptiste Baham in 1800, before the United States acquired this area, as the town of &quot;Coquille&quot; or &quot;Cokie&quot; because of the abundance of shells in the area, at the site of the Native American village of &quot;Chiconcte&quot;. The town was renamed in honor of US President James Madison around 1811.

Madisonville was a notable port, providing bricks and other products of the towns along the Tchefuncte River to New Orleans, in the decades before the Civil War. After the Capture of New Orleans by the Union Army, this area remained under nominal Confederate control; and the cutoff of trade with New Orleans across enemy lines was devastating to the local economy, which did not recover for decades after the peace.

The opening of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway and associated highways gradually brought Madisonville into the sphere of Greater New Orleans, in the second half of the 20th century.

Much of the town flooded with the Lake Pontchartrain storm surge of Hurricane Katrina, on August 29, 2005. The police/fire station and the town hall were damaged by the flood waters. The town flooded again in 2012 during Hurricane Isaac. Town buildings were again repaired but the police station was moved to a historic building at the intersection of Covington, St. John and Cedar Streets. The fire station later moved to a new building on Hwy. 22 just west of the town center.

===Jahncke shipyard===
Frederick (Fritz) Jahncke emigrated to New Orleans from Hamburg, Germany in 1870. After working as a mason, he started a business that built the first sidewalks in New Orleans. Jahncke expanded; using a rented steam-driven hydraulic suction dredge, his firm was the first to extract sand and shell from the Tchefuncte and other rivers to make concrete used in expanding New Orleans.
Jahncke purchased a half-interest in the Baham Shipyard, entering into shipbuilding. In 1905 he purchased the remaining interest, acquiring land for yards, as well as warehouses, docks, storage facilities and equipment. He died in 1911 and the company passed to Ernest Lee, Paul F. and Walter F. Jahncke. In 1917, the company started building five wooden ships for the US Navy for World War I. Two ships were completed – the &quot;SS Bayou Teche&quot;, which was launched in March 1918, and the &quot;SS Balabac&quot; on September 29, 1918. The war ended November 11, 1918, and three of the ships were not completed. The &quot;SS Abbeville&quot; was completed on January 19, 1919, and the &quot;SS Pontchartrain&quot; on April 6, 1919. The last ship was hauled across the river and burned. Part of the hull is still visible at low tide.

The Jahncke Shipyard, once a hub of shipbuilding activity during World War I, is no longer operational. While the shipyard itself is now a historical site, its legacy lives on in the maritime industry in the area. Just 2 miles downriver from the original Jahncke Shipyard site is Marina del Ray, which has grown to become the largest marina in the region, serving as a key facility for local boaters and visitors alike.

<text>Mandeville is a city in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, its population was 13,192. Mandeville is located on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain, south of Interstate 12. It is located directly across the lake from the city of New Orleans and its southshore suburbs. Mandeville is part of the New Orleans-Metairie metropolitan statistical area.

== History ==
The city of Mandeville was founded in 1834 by Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville (1785–1868). The Marigny family was a prominent family of Louisiana, owning nearly a third of the city of New Orleans. The area had long been agricultural land when the town of Mandeville was laid out in 1834 by developer Bernard de Marigny. In 1840, Mandeville was incorporated as a town. It became a popular summer destination for well-to-do New Orleanians wishing to escape the city&#x27;s heat.

In the mid-19th century, regular daily steamboat traffic between New Orleans and Mandeville began, and by the end of the Victorian era, it had become a popular weekend destination of the New Orleans middle class, as well. Bands played music on the ships going across the lake and at pavilions and dance halls in Mandeville, and the town became one of the first places where the new &quot;jazz&quot; music was heard outside of New Orleans. Bunk Johnson, Buddy Petit, Papa Celestin, George Lewis, Kid Ory, Edmond Hall, Chester Zardis, and many other early jazz artists regularly played in Mandeville.

In the late 19th century, Mandeville was home of the Harvey School (Mandeville), a college preparatory institution.

Two buildings from early jazz history still stand in Mandeville. Ruby&#x27;s Roadhouse has been in continuous operation since the 1920s (formerly Buck&#x27;s Brown Derby and Ruby&#x27;s Rendezvous) and is still a popular bar and live music venue today. The Dew Drop Social and Benevolent Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, opened in January 1895. For years, the hall hosted some of the jazz greats and was reopened in 2000 as the Dew Drop Jazz and Social Hall, a live jazz venue. (This was one of the earliest &quot;Dew Drop&quot; dance halls; venues across the South were similarly named, including the club in New Orleans where Little Richard got his start.)

In 1956, the first span of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway opened to automobile traffic. A second span was added in 1969. The new road spurred the growth of Mandeville and the surrounding area as a suburban commuter community for people working in New Orleans. This trend increased in the 1980s and 1990s, further integrating Mandeville into the greater New Orleans metropolitan area.
Mandeville was affected by Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s storm surge on August 29, 2005, and received water and wind damage. Parts of the city also experienced less dramatic flooding when Lake Pontchartrain overflowed its banks due to Hurricane Ike in 2008. By 2009, most of the reconstruction from Katrina was completed. Many homes and businesses in areas that experienced flooding have been elevated.

<text>Pearl River is a town in St. Tammany Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The population was 2,506 at the 2010 U.S. census, and 2,618 at the 2020 population estimates program. It is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The community that is today Pearl River was originally known as Halloo, a moniker it reputedly garnered from loggers yelling to one another as they labored along the nearby Pearl River. The town was founded in 1859. Early Halloo was a small railroad town, located at the junction of the Northeastern and Poitevent and Favre&#x27;s East Louisiana Railroads. In 1886 a train station was constructed at the site, and two years later Samuel Russ Poitevent (June 4, 1852– June 3, 1904), established the first store in the village. The community&#x27;s name was first changed from Halloo (1859) to Pearl (1878), later to Pearlville (1881), and eventually Pearl River, in 1888, after the train station built in the town.

On July 13, 1898, the 200 citizens of Pearl River voted to petition the state of Louisiana for incorporation as the &quot;Village of Pearl River&quot;, a request which was granted nearly a decade later, on May 24, 1906, by governor Newton Crain Blanchard, with G.W. Fuller as the first mayor. The village slowly modernized over the course of the next half century, acquiring the land for a courthouse in 1935 and a town hall ten years later. Pearl River Junior High was opened in 1963, but the building was made into a police training academy in 2005. In 1964, the village insignia was replaced, as the newly minted &quot;town&quot; laid claim to 1,500 residents, a designation that lives on today, in the town of about 2,500.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.27%, is water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,565 people, 902 households, and 639 families residing in the town. At the 2019 American Community Survey, 92.5% of the population was White, 3.8% Black and African American, 3.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, and 0.5% from two or more races. There was a median household income of $56,061 and families lived in 902 housing units. An estimated 13.5% of the population lived at or below the poverty line in 2019.

<doc id="115783" wikidata="Q988156" url="?curid=115783" title="Slidell, Louisiana">
<text>Slidell is a city on the northeast shore of Lake Pontchartrain in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 28,781 at the 2020 census, making it the sixteenth-most populous city in Louisiana. It is part of the New Orleans−Metairie−Kenner metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
===Beginning===
One of the earlier settlers to the area was Foster Willie. Along with a younger brother, Wesley Coke Asbury Gause, Judge Wingate, and several others, he left Shallotte, North Carolina, on February 18, and arrived at Pearlington, Mississippi, on April 14, 1836. Wesley and his family remained there, while John and family crossed the Pearl River and built a log cabin on the west bank, a little further south. He then began a lumber mill in the fledgling town later known as Slidell. His traveling back and forth from lumber yard to home created a road known today as Gause Boulevard, a major east–west street in the town. The lumber yard was where Gause Boulevard crosses the railroad track. The log cabin was built at the east end of the road, just a few yards from the river. The house stood until the late 1990s, and a small family burial plot still remains where John is buried between his two wives, Lydia Russ and Johanna Frederica VanHeemskerk.

Slidell was founded on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain in 1882 and 1883 during construction of the New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad (N.O.N.E.). The N.O.N.E. line connected New Orleans to Meridian, Mississippi. The town was named in honor of American politician and Confederate ambassador to France John Slidell, and officially chartered by the Louisiana State Legislature in 1888.

===20th century and beyond===
Around 1910, Slidell began a period of economic and industrial growth. A large creosote plant was built, and Slidell became home to the Fritz Salmen Brickyard, a major producer of bricks later named St. Joe Brick. A lumber mill and shipyard were also built. Following the construction of Interstate 10, Interstate 59, and Interstate 12, Slidell became a major crossroads for those traversing the Gulf States.

In 1915, the creosote plant burned to the ground. The plant was rebuilt on Bayou Lane, closer to a water source and a fire station. Eventually, creosote polluted the bayou, a source of drinking water for many of Slidell&#x27;s residents. The creosote plant was abandoned in 1986 and became an EPA Superfund site. The canal was dredged and waste incinerated until completion of the cleanup in the 1990s. At that time a boat launch was built and Heritage Park was constructed on the former site.

With the advent of the U.S. space program in the 1960s, NASA opened the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, the John C. Stennis Space Center in nearby Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and a NASA computer center on Gause Boulevard. This nearly tripled Slidell&#x27;s population over ten years, and the city became a major suburb of New Orleans. The National Weather Service forecast office for the New Orleans and Baton Rouge area is also in Slidell. Slidell is the headquarters of Vesco Tennis Courts, a privately held firm specializing in construction of hard surfaces for outdoor sports facilities.

The city has hosted several parade krewes each Carnival season.

On August 29, 2005, Slidell suffered extensive damage from Hurricane Katrina, as the storm made final landfall on the morning of August 29, 2005. The municipal area is about inland, and parts of the city experienced a storm surge in excess of . The unincorporated areas of St. Tammany Parish, to the south and east, often called Slidell, experienced a storm surge of .

On April 20, 2011, an Amtrak train derailed in Slidell which injured six people.

On April 10, 2024, an EF2 tornado struck through the southern side of the city.

The city received 7 inches of snow during the January 20–22, 2025 Gulf Coast blizzard

<doc id="115785" wikidata="Q255802" url="?curid=115785" title="Amite City, Louisiana">
<text>Amite City ( or ; commonly just Amite) is a town in and the seat of Tangipahoa Parish in southeastern Louisiana, United States. The population was 4,141 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Hammond MSA.

==History==
The first European settlement, by French traders and colonists, developed on the banks of the Tangipahoa River, adjacent to a Choctaw village. Legend has it that the site was chosen when Choctaw Chief Baptiste welcomed the earliest settlers. Baptiste was the last Choctaw chief in the region. &quot;Amite&quot; has been said to be a Choctaw word for &quot;red ant&quot;, signifying &quot;thrift&quot;. It may also be derived from French, where &quot;amitié&quot; means &quot;friendship.&quot;

The United States acquired what were known as the Florida Parishes in 1812. Anglo-American travelers are documented as entering Amite City as early as 1813.

In 1852 the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad was chartered in both Louisiana and Mississippi. Two years later, the railroad was opened from New Orleans to the state line. Amite City was chosen as the practical stopping point, as it was halfway between Lake Pontchartrain to the south and the Mississippi state line that formed the northern border of the parish.

Amite City was chartered in 1855. The town was laid out, lots were sold and the community quickly began to grow. The Hotel Ponder at the &quot;Amite Station&quot; became a popular spot among travelers for dining and relaxing. In addition to becoming a major commercial center for a large region, Amite Station became a popular resort in the late 1850s. Many prosperous New Orleans residents established country retreats in the region to enjoy the natural beauty and escape unhealthy conditions in the low-lying city along the Mississippi. This trend intensified as seasonal epidemics of yellow fever continued to plague New Orleans in the mid-19th century.

On March 7, 1861, Amite City was incorporated as a town two months after the secession of Louisiana from the Union. During the war, Amite City served as an important gathering spot for Confederate officials involved in the supply and support of Camp Moore, the largest Confederate training base in Louisiana, located 10 miles to the north. Amite endured at least two visits by Union cavalry. In 1864 a brigade of Union infantry burned the railroad depot and destroyed the track from the depot to Camp Moore.

After the war, Amite City served as the base for Union troops occupying the region during Reconstruction. After the legislature established a new parish in 1869, soon to be named Tangipahoa, Amite City was selected as the parish seat. Five different buildings have served as the courthouse since 1870.

From the early 1870s through the first decade of the 20th century, Amite City played a central role in the violence that gained the parish the name &quot;Bloody Tangipahoa.&quot; The turbulent political and economic conditions of the Reconstruction period and its aftermath sparked a number of vicious family feuds. Numerous duels and &quot;bushwhacking&quot; between whites occurred in the streets of Amite City and the countryside. In addition, white mobs lynched numerous blacks during this period. By the early 20th century, improved law enforcement brought some peace and better harmony to the area for some families, but blacks were excluded from political life.

Amite City continued to grow as a trading center for cotton planters and others. In 1869, the Gullet Gin Company opened in Amite City. The company was the largest producer of cotton gins in the south, employing more than 250 people by the early 20th century.

During World War II, the plant converted to war industry production, manufacturing 150 mm shells. The plant closed in 1963.

In the mid-20th century, family dairy farms began to replace cotton farms. Today, Tangipahoa Parish is the heart of Louisiana&#x27;s dairy industry. It is also the primary producer of strawberries in the state. Amite City is a major oyster processing center and home of the Oyster Festival.

<doc id="115786" wikidata="Q1014071" url="?curid=115786" title="Hammond, Louisiana">
<text>Hammond is the largest city in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, United States, located east of Baton Rouge and northwest of New Orleans. Its population was 20,019 in the 2010 U.S. census, and 21,359 at the 2020 population estimates program.

Hammond is home to Southeastern Louisiana University. It is the principal city of the Hammond metropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Tangipahoa Parish and is a part of the Baton Rouge-Hammond combined statistical area.

==History==

===19th century===
The city is named for Peter Hammond (1798–1870), the surname anglicized from Peter av Hammerdal (Peter of Hammerdal) — a Swedish immigrant known as the first European settler, arriving around 1818. Peter, a sailor, had been briefly imprisoned by the British at Dartmoor Prison during the Napoleonic Wars. He escaped during a prison riot, made his way back to sea, and later reached New Orleans.

Hammond used his savings to buy then-inexpensive land northwest of Lake Pontchartrain. He developed a plantation to cultivate trees, which he made into masts, charcoal, and other products for the maritime industry in New Orleans. He transported the goods by oxcart to the head of navigation on the Natalbany River at Springfield. He held at least 30 enslaved African Americans before the Civil War. Hammond lost his wealth during the war, as Union soldiers raided his property.

In 1854, the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad (later the Illinois Central Railroad, now Canadian National Railway) came through the area, launching the town&#x27;s emergence as a commercial and transport center. The point where the railroad met the trail to Springfield was at first known as Hammond&#x27;s Crossing.

During the Civil War, the city was a shoe-making center for the Confederate States Army. Charles Emery Cate developed the shoe industry after buying land in the city in 1860 for his home, a shoe factory, a tannery, and a sawmill. Toward the end of the war, Cate laid out the town&#x27;s grid, using the rail line as a guide and naming several of the streets after his sons. Also, Cate Street is named for him.

After the Civil War, light industry and commercial activities were attracted to the town. By the end of the 19th century, Hammond had become a stopping point for northern rail passengers traveling south and for New Orleanians heading north to escape seasonal summer yellow fever outbreaks. The city later became a shipping point for strawberries. A state historical plaque downtown marks it as &quot;Strawberry Capital of America&quot;.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In the 1920s, David William Thomas edited a weekly newspaper in Hammond prior to moving to Minden, the seat of Webster Parish. There, he was elected mayor in 1936.

In 1932, Hodding Carter founded the &quot;Hammond Daily Courier&quot;, which he left in 1939 to move to Greenville, Mississippi. The paper closed. Carter later received a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the Civil Rights Movement.

In 1944, the Tangipahoa Parish Library – Hammond branch was established.

Since 1959, &quot;The Daily Star&quot; has been Hammond&#x27;s locally published daily newspaper.

During World War II, the Hammond Airport (now Hammond Northshore Regional Airport) served as a detention camp for prisoners of war from Nazi Germany.

Additionally, the U.S. Army established and used the Hammond Bombing and Gunnery Range east of the city. In the early 21st century, Army Corps of Engineers searched for remaining explosives in this area.

Today, Hammond is intersected by Interstates 12 and 55. Its airport has a long runway which serves as a backup landing site for Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. It is also a major training site for the Louisiana Army National Guard, and the home base for the Louisiana Air National Guard&#x27;s 236th Combat Communications Squadron.

About south of the city, on both the railroad and I–55, lies Port Manchac, which provides egress via Lake Pontchartrain to the Gulf of Mexico. The combination of highway-rail-air-sea transportation has transformed modern Hammond from a strawberry capital to a transportation capital. The city hosts numerous warehouses and is a distribution point for Walmart and other major businesses. Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond offers the state&#x27;s only academic degree in supply chain management.

In 1953, John Desmond opened the first architectural firm in Hammond. He was chief architect of the Tangipahoa Parish School Board for some two decades before he relocated to Baton Rouge.

Among the city&#x27;s cultural resources is the Tangipahoa African American Heritage Museum. This is one of the destinations on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. Southeastern took over the Columbia Theatre in the designated Hammond Historic District to use as a downtown cultural venue. The former movie theater was constructed in 1928 and renovated by the university in the 1990s for $5.6 million.

On August 29, 2021, Hammond suffered a direct strike by the eastern eyewall of Hurricane Ida. It dropped more than of rain, and caused severe flash flooding, and significant wind damage.

==Geography==

==Education==

Southeastern Louisiana University (SLU), based in Hammond, is one of the state&#x27;s regional universities and one of the city&#x27;s largest employers. It was established in 1925 through the efforts of the educator Linus A. Sims, then principal of Hammond High School. The city is also home to Northshore Technical Community College. There are also two vocational colleges in the city, Petra College and Compass Career College, both of which offer allied health and medical certifications.

The city&#x27;s public schools are part of the Tangipahoa Parish School System and include Hammond High Magnet School, Hammond Junior High, Eastside Elementary, Westside Elementary, SLU Laboratory School, and Crystal Academy (an alternative school).

The Catholic Church operates two schools in Hammond: Holy Ghost Catholic School (pre-kindergarten through 8th grades) and Saint Thomas Aquinas High School, which is just north of the city. In addition, Trafton Academy (pre-K through 8th) and Oaks Montessori School (pre-K through 8th) are private schools serving area students.

In 2018, press reports indicated that only 74% of the local population held high school diplomas. In this respect, Hammond ranks among the bottom 25 cities nationally and is comparable to Salem, Oregon, and Tucson, Arizona. With only 20% of people having a college degree, the city was in the bottom quarter nationwide in this ranking too. Schools in this district are ranked in the lower 50% of public schools in the state.

The TPPS had 19,500 students enrolled for the 2020-2021 academic year and an annual budget of $219 million.

==Sports, parks, and recreation==

* Louisiana State Police (LSP)

The Hammond Police Department is headquartered at 120 S Oak St. The city&#x27;s uniform crime reporting statistics are available on the FBI UCR website.

==Health care==
Hammond and its immediate environs have a number of hospitals, including North Oaks Medical Center on U.S. Route 51 Business between Hammond and Ponchatoula. North Oaks is one of the largest hospitals in Louisiana and helps serve the teaching needs of Southeastern Louisiana University&#x27;s College of Nursing &amp; Health Sciences.

==Transportation==

Hammond has railways, highways (including the intersection of two interstates), and air travel/transport.

===Passenger rail===

Both the southbound and northbound daily &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; schedules have afternoon stops in Hammond, so Amtrak Superliner trains are a common sight. About 15,000 passengers use the station every year. Many are coming from or going to Baton Rouge, some west.

The Queen Anne-style station (1912), situated at the center of town, was renovated in 2008, with an ADA-compliant platform added soon after that.

===Highways===
Part of Hammond&#x27;s success is due to its location at the junction of two heavily traveled interstate highways:

* Interstate 12, from Baton Rouge to Slidell, is a shortcut for Interstate 10 drivers to avoid congestion in New Orleans.
* Interstate 55, from Laplace (west of New Orleans) to Chicago, also passes through Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis, and St. Louis.

Hammond is from Baton Rouge, from New Orleans, from Gulfport, Mississippi, and from Jackson, Mississippi.

Two U.S. highways serve the city:

* U.S. Route 51 (Morrison Boulevard) splits from I-55 between Hammond and Ponchatoula and parallels I-55 northward through the city&#x27;s western side. U.S. 51 Business, which follows the original route of U.S. 51, leaves the parent 51 south of Ponchatoula and rejoins it after meeting US 190 in downtown Hammond and forming a concurrency with 190 until it meets US 51.
* U.S. Route 190 (Thomas Street / Morris Avenue) parallels I-12 and goes east–west through the city&#x27;s commercial and historic downtown areas.

State highways serving the area include:

* LA 443 (Morris Road)
* LA 1040 (Chauvin Drive and Old Baton Rouge Highway)
* LA 1064 (Natalbany Road, River Road)
* LA 1065 (North Cherry Street)
* LA 1067 (Old Covington Highway; decommissioned in 2000)
* LA 1249 (Pumpkin Center Road)
* LA 3158 (Airport Road)
* LA 3234 (University Avenue, continuation of Wardline Road, serving Southeastern Louisiana University)
* LA 3260 (West Church Street Extension; decommissioned in 2018)

===Airport===
The Hammond Northshore Regional Airport has a runway long enough to land the Concorde (1976–2003) and to serve as back-up for Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. The largest unit of the Louisiana Army National Guard is stationed at Hammond, adjacent to the site. The airport is also the home base for the 236th Combat Communications Squadron of the Louisiana Air National Guard.

The airport has no regularly scheduled passenger service but is convenient for charter flights and corporate aviation purposes.

<text>Independence, originally known as Uncle Sam, is a town in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,665 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Hammond MSA.

==History==

The move to establish Independence as a town was led in the early 20th century by State Representative Harry D. Wilson, who subsequently served from 1916 until his death early in 1948 as the Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry. Wilson was a son of Dr. and Mrs. William D. Wilson. In 1856, Dr. Wilson had built a store in Independence, which remained for years the oldest building in the community. Harry Wilson worked in the parish seat of Amite in the general store of the merchant Jacob Stern at a time when Tangipahoa Parish did not yet depend on the strawberry crop. During the 1890s, Wilson was an express messenger for the Illinois Central Railroad. He left that position to pursue a political career.

Affectionately known by voters as &quot;Uncle Harry&quot; or &quot;Mister Harry&quot;, Wilson served two nonconsecutive terms in the state House from 1900 to 1904 and again from 1908 to 1912. A strong promoter of his hometown of Independence, located five miles to the south of Amite, Wilson in 1902 and 1903 corresponded with Governor William Wright Heard regarding incorporation of the community, which at the time had a population of 308. Governor Heard informed Wilson that he considered the three square miles proposed for the new town as too much land for a small village and suggested that the tract be reduced in size. Originally named &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;, Independence had begun in 1852 when the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad began operating through the area. Independence was finally proclaimed a town on August 22, 1912.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,635 people, 711 households, and 492 families residing in the town.

==Arts and culture==
Independence has a large Italian-American community, as do neighboring towns and villages. Independence has a Sicilian heritage festival every year the second weekend in March. Independence has sometimes been referred to colloquially as Little Italy, and Italian expatriates began settling here as early as the 19th Century.

Many attributes of the Italian culture, including food, in Independence are described in &quot;Italian Culture in Independence&quot;. Other useful resources are Southeastern Louisiana University&#x27;s Center for Regional Studies and the Tangipahoa Parish tourist information center.

==Education==
Tangipahoa Parish School Board operates public schools:
*Independence High Magnet School
*Independence Leadership Academy

==Notable people==
* Nick Bruno, President of the University of Louisiana at Monroe
* Robert Crais, best-selling novelist
* Steven Jyles, a Canadian Football League quarterback
* Frank Lockett, former NFL wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins
* Clif Richardson, former state representative
* LaBrandon Toefield, former LSU star runningback and NFL runningback for the Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers

<text>Kentwood is a rural town in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, United States, near the Mississippi state line. The population was 2,198 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Hammond MSA.

==History==
Amos Kent assisted in laying out the town. The Postmaster named the town in honor of Kent on February 29, 1888.

On August 30, 2012, damage was caused by pressure on the 2,300 foot Percy Quin dam, a dam on the Tangipahoa River north of Kentwood, as a result of Hurricane Isaac, led to Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal calling for a mandatory evacuation of the town due to fears of large-scale flooding from Lake Tangipahoa. The evacuation order, which was amended twice, was later rescinded as the dam held. The lake was drawn down so repairs could be made.

The 490-acre Lake Tangipahoa, which opened in 1939 and is located six miles south of McComb, Mississippi, was reopened in 2016. Repairs had been completed in 2014 and the lake restocked.

==Geography==

<text>Ponchatoula is the second-largest city in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana. The population was 6,559 at the 2010 census and 7,545 at the time of the 2020 population estimates program.

==Etymology==
It is speculated that the name is derived from the Choctaw words &quot;Pashi&quot; meaning &quot;hair&quot; and perhaps &quot;itula&quot; or &quot;itola&quot; meaning &quot;to fall&quot; or &quot;to hang&quot; or &quot;flowing&quot; in the Choctaw language.

==History==

The city of Ponchatoula was founded when the railroad from Jackson, Mississippi to New Orleans was constructed through this area in the 1850s. The New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad Company hired an experienced civil engineer, James B. Clarke (ca. 1809–1861) to survey the projected railroad route, establish railroad depot sites, buy timber for bridges and railroad ties, and do the other tasks necessary to construct the railroad.

Finding that there was an unclaimed section of land north of the Manchac swamp, Clarke located a railroad depot near the first dry land after leaving the swamp. Mr. Clarke purchased this one square mile section of land from the state of Louisiana in two installments in December 1852 and January 1853. He surveyed this land and laid out a town in 1853 using the familiar grid system with streets running east–west named for native trees, and north–south streets numbered one through nine. He called his new development &quot;Ponchatoula&quot; after the Ponchatoula River located a couple of miles west of the new settlement. Ponchatoula is a Choctaw word meaning &quot;hanging hair&quot; referring to the beautiful Spanish moss which drapes many of the local trees.

James Clarke began selling town lots, and soon several stores and dozens of homes were built nearby. Ponchatoula grew as new settlers moved here to be near the railroad line, &quot;a new avenue of commerce.&quot; The small town was incorporated by the Louisiana legislature in February 1861. A few months after the incorporation of the town, the Civil War began with serious consequences for the community. Because Ponchatoula was located on the vital railroad line, military engagements happened here in September 1862 and March 1863. During the war, stores and some homes were looted, the train depot burned, and livestock killed and stolen.

When the war ended, the railroad line was repaired, a new train depot constructed, and tranquility returned to the little piney woods community. Through the following decades the town&#x27;s population slowly grew with lumbering and agriculture being the primary local industries. Around 1900, the strawberry industry began to florish and Ponchatoula became an important shipping point for strawberries and vegetables. Hundreds of refrigerated railroad cars left Ponchatoula each spring loaded with strawberries for the northern markets.

The Ponchatoula community changed completely in 1921 when two large cypress lumbering companies located at the south edge of town. Hundreds of mill workers and their families arrived and the economy prospered with the increased population. The 1920s saw the construction of a new city hall and fire station, a new high school, a modern theater, improved street and municipal services, and dozens of new businesses. The prosperity of the 1920s ebbed as the hard times of the Depression arrived with the closing of the two lumber mills in 1929, and continued through the 1930s mirroring the national economic crisis. Ponchatoula&#x27;s economy was aided during the Depression by the flourishing strawberry industry and the reopening of a cypress lumber company on one of the former mill sites.

During World War II, Ponchatoula stepped up and actively supported the war effort. Hundreds of local men and women entered the armed forces, war bond drives and several scrap drives were held, along with other war related activities. A scrap drive led by the local school children yielded a vast amount of iron needed to produce the weapons of war. The community&#x27;s outstanding contribution to the war effort was recognized when the Navy launched an oil tanker named the &quot;USS Ponchatoula&quot;, which served in the Pacific. This vessel was scrapped after the war, but a new and much larger oil tanker was built in the 1950s and also named the &quot;USS Ponchatoula&quot;. The new vessel served with distinction for many years.

Ponchatoula continued to grow in the post war years and the economy became more diversified and less connected to the strawberry and lumbering industries.

In recent years Ponchatoula has become a tourist destination with a quaint historic district, and was designated as &quot;America&#x27;s Antique City.&quot; The community hosts the well-known Strawberry Festival, which attracts many thousands of visitors every April.

===Early 20th century===

The train depot which was destroyed during the Civil War was rebuilt in 1895 as the area began to recover from the Civil War. At the turn of the 20th century Ponchatoula began to transform from the lumber industry into a commercial farming community. The main street began filling up with beautiful brick buildings as shops, banks and restaurants were built to accommodate the growing population. The main crop grown by the local farmers was the strawberry. Many of the families who were major farmers during this era, which lasted about eighty years, have their last names engraved on a large plaque in front of city hall.

==Geography==
Ponchatoula is located at an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Ponchatoula is located along Interstate 55 and Louisiana Highway 22, equidistant from New Orleans and Baton Rouge. In the early 1900s, Ponchatoula was one of only two ways to reach New Orleans by land, thus earning the moniker &quot;Gateway to New Orleans.&quot;

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 7,822 people, 2,863 households, and 1,726 families residing in the city.

==Visitor attractions==

Ponchatoula hosts Louisiana&#x27;s Strawberry Festival each April and an Oktoberfest each autumn.

The town is noted for its many antique shops along Pine Street (LA 22), open year-round. Eleven of the Ponchatoula Commercial Historic District buildings are determined to be historically significant and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ponchatoula is small, but it has a number of attractions including a sign on the outskirts of town with how many miles it lies from South Dakota&#x27;s Wall Drug store.

Across Highway 22 from Hardhide is the Collinswood School Museum, a former one-room schoolhouse which exhibits local artifacts and quilts. Between the school museum and the tracks stands the Strawberry Train, which is a steam engine and single passenger car roped off in such a way that children can safely climb into the engine and the car.

The Chamber of Commerce office is located on Highway 22 at the railroad tracks and has information about these and other sights in Ponchatoula and the surrounding area.

===Strawberry Festival===
The first Strawberry Festival was held in April 1972 on the first block of North 6th Street and was co-sponsored by the Ponchatoula Jaycees and the Ponchatoula Chamber of Commerce. The first festival was small and only had 11 booths. It was a two-day event beginning with a baseball game between Southeastern Louisiana University and Wisconsin State. Today it is the second largest event in the state, after Mardi Gras. During the 1980s the local economy changed to tourism, when farming no longer earned enough to sustain the town. The mayor at the time devised a plan to open antique shops where former businesses had been located. There are still about six of these shops in operation. This gave the town a second nickname, &quot;America&#x27;s Antique City.&quot;

<text>Newellton is a town in northern Tensas Parish in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Louisiana. The population was 886 in the 2020 census, a decline of 596 persons, or 40 percent, from the 2000 tabulation of 1,482.

Newellton is west of the Mississippi River on Lake St. Joseph, an ox-bow lake. Further south toward St. Joseph, the parish seat of government, is another ox-bow lake, Lake Bruin, a part of which is the popular Lake Bruin State Park.

==History==
Newellton itself was founded in the early 19th century by the Routh family, for whom the defunct Routhwood Elementary School was named. John David Stokes Newell Sr., a planter and lawyer in St. Joseph, the seat of Tensas Parish, named the settlement for his father, Edward, a native of North Carolina who relocated to Tensas Parish in 1834.

Newellton was designated a village in 1904. On April 4, 1951, under Mayor T. T. Hargrove, Newellton was upgraded to a town through the state Lawrason Act.

In March 2014, Newellton became debt-free.

==Geography==
Newellton is located at (32.072740, -91.239230).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (12.64%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 886 people, 403 households, and 245 families residing in the town.

==Politics==
In 2012, the former Newellton mayor, Democrat Alex Davis (born 1942), did not seek a fourth term. The first African American in the position, Davis unseated the 34-year incumbent Edwin G. Preis Sr., a white businessman, in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 7, 2000. Davis received 366 votes (56.8 percent) to Preis&#x27; 184 (28.6 percent), and Floyd Aaron &quot;Coonie&quot; McVay&#x27;s 94 votes (14.6 percent). A native of Oak Grove in West Carroll Parish, McVay was formerly the Newellton police chief. He died in 2012 at the age of eighty.

The current mayor is the African-American Democrat Timothy Durell Turner, the former District 1 alderman, who won the election held on December 8, 2012, by a single vote, 217-216, over the Republican candidate, James Carroll Fuller Sr. (1936-2021), the former District 5 alderman. Fuller, who is white, is a former resident of Braxton, Mississippi, and Denham Springs, Louisiana. Fuller had led Turner, 259 (44.7 percent) to 207 (35.8 percent), in the higher-turnout primary election held on November 6, with another 113 votes (19.5 percent) then cast for a second Democrat, Knola Ransome.

In 2016, Fuller again challenged Turner and once again lost by one vote, 210 for Fuller and 211 for Turner.

Fuller earlier was among 582 Louisiana elected officials named to former Governor Bobby Jindal&#x27;s &quot;Kitchen Cabinet Leadership Team&quot;. Two other Tensas Parish officials appointed to the panel were Assessor Irby Gamble and Coroner Keith D. Butler, both of St. Joseph.

The Newellton police chief, Johnny Gales (1951-2021), a Democrat, was reelected in 2012. There are five municipal alderman, one of whom, Lavone G. Garner from District 5, is a Republican. She was elected to succeed Carroll Fuller, who left the council with his first race for mayor.

<text>St. Josephis a town in, and the parish seat of, rural Tensas Parish in northeastern Louisiana, United States, in the delta of the Mississippi River. The population was 1,176 at the 2010 census. The town had an African-American majority of 77.4 percent in 2010.

==History==
The first store at what became St. Joseph was established around 1813 at what was then called John Densmore&#x27;s Landing. Unique for the Deep South, St. Joseph was planned and developed in 1843 by European-American settlers around a New England–style village green. The downtown area along Plank Road is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The area around the town was developed for cotton plantations.

From 1862 to 1865, Louisiana was part of the Confederacy&#x27;s Trans-Mississippi Department, and St. Joseph operated as a landing for a major route across the Mississippi River. According to the historian John D. Winters in his &quot;The Civil War in Louisiana&quot;, &quot;Such a strong force of Confederate cavalry occupied the Mississippi side opposite St. Joseph that all Federal attempts to close the transit in January [1865] ended in failure.&quot;

In 1879, the Jesse James gang robbed two stores in far western Mississippi, at Washington and Fayette. The gang absconded with $2,000 cash in the second robbery, crossed the river, and took shelter in abandoned cabins on the Kemp Plantation south of St. Joseph. A posse caught up with them, attacking and killing two of the outlaws, but failed to capture the entire gang. Among the deputies was Jefferson B. Snyder, who later was a long-serving district attorney in northeastern Louisiana. Jesse James was killed three years later by one of his own gang members in St. Joseph, Missouri.

St. Joseph is the entry community to Lake Bruin State Park located on Lake Bruin, an oxbow lake of the nearby Mississippi River.

On August 13, 2013, local resident Fuaed Abdo Ahmed took two women and a man hostage at the St. Joseph branch of Tensas State Bank, saying he wanted passage out of the country. After releasing one hostage, he shot one hostage and critically wounded a second before being fatally shot by police.

===Political history===


When St. Joseph was incorporated as a town in 1901, planter and businessman William Mackenzie Davidson was elected as the first mayor of St. Joseph. Absent competitive politics, given the disenfranchisement of African Americans by the state constitution in 1898, Davidson was re-elected repeatedly, holding the position until his accidental death in January 1930. Davidson was a founder and the general manager of the powerful Panola Company, an agricultural business in St. Joseph. At one point it controlled 10,000 acres of valuable farmland.

Davidson also sat on the board of the Bank of St. Joseph, of which he later became the president. He worked to bring the USDA Agricultural Experiment Station to St. Joseph and lobbied for construction of the Mississippi River bridge to connect the town to Natchez, Mississippi.

Edward L. Brown Sr. was born on October 20, 1952, to son of Leon and Beatrice Brown. He graduated from Grambling State University and is married to Betty S. Brown; the couple has four children. Brown was elected in 2000 as the first African-American mayor of St. Joseph, unseating the long-term white incumbent, Whitfield Jones (February 18, 1929 – August 11, 2013) in the nonpartisan blanket primary. Brown polled 447 votes (64.9 percent) to Jones&#x27; 242 (35.1 percent).

Brown was repeatedly re-elected. In the November 6, 2012, election, Brown secured his fourth term with 384 votes (57.7 percent) over Leslie Dandridge Durham, a fellow Democrat who polled 282 votes (42.3 percent).

Prior to 1968, each parish in Louisiana, regardless of population, elected at least one member to the Louisiana House of Representatives. This method of representation resulted in under-representation of the more heavily populated and urbanized parishes. The US Supreme Court ruled on the principle that state legislatures had to establish districts with roughly equal populations, in order to support the principle of equity of &quot;one man, one vote&quot;. It said the states had no basis for geographic representation in their legislatures. Given the rural bias and dominance in many state legislatures, many states had not accomplished redistricting since early in the 20th century, although it is to be conducted as needed after every decennial census.

The last state representative member to represent only Tensas Parish was Democrat S. S. DeWitt of Newellton and later St. Joseph. DeWitt represented Tensas Parish from 1964 to 1968. After the state legislature created districts that were roughly equal in population, DeWitt succeeded in being elected again, to serve from 1968 to 1972. He and Lantz Womack of Winnsboro together represented Franklin, Tensas, and Madison parishes. Womack defeated DeWitt in the 1971 primary. DeWitt later switched to Republican Party affiliation.

===Water system===
In December 2012, St. Joseph residents were placed under an advisory to boil their drinking water because of problems with the aging municipal water system. A mechanical failure at the town treatment plant caused a sudden drop in the water supply. In March 2013, a water main cracked. There are leaks at the base of the city water tower. State Senator Francis C. Thompson, whose district includes Tensas Parish, sought emergency funding for repairs to the system, which serves about seven hundred customers.

In 2016 the town had failed to obtain an approved town audit for the financial year ending 2015, needed by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor&#x27;s Office to enable progress on the funds. In 2015, it received $553,000 in grants towards the issue. More than $6 million is available once the town&#x27;s audit is approved by the Auditor&#x27;s Office.

In December 2016, Governor John Bel Edwards vowed to replace the entire St. Joseph water system. Engineer Bryant Hammett, a Democratic former state representative who performed similar work in his native Ferriday, predicted the project, estimated at $9 million, could be finished by September 2017. Residents were urged not to drink the water or use it in cooking, but they can use it for bathing or washing clothing. The Governor&#x27;s Office of Homeland Security was providing bottled drinking water for St. Joseph residents.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.9 square mile (2.3 km), all land.

===Climate===
==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 831 people, 377 households, and 200 families residing in the town.

==Education==
Tensas High School, a consolidation of three former schools, Joseph Moore Davidson High School in St. Joseph, Newellton High School in Newellton, and Waterproof High School in Waterproof, began operating in the fall of 2006 on the Davidson campus. The Tensas Parish School Board has attempted to improve educational quality by focusing on one high school for the entire parish, which has the smallest population of any parish in Louisiana. Troubles broke out at the school on November 2, 2006, and fourteen students were arrested by the sheriff&#x27;s department. Overt tensions thereafter subsided.

In August 1970, Tensas Academy, a private school, opened in St. Joseph during the first semester of school desegregation after the district was ordered to comply with federal courts. It is still operating.

<text>Waterproof is a village in Tensas Parish in northeastern Louisiana, United States with a population of 541 as of the 2020 census. The village in 2010 was 91.7 percent African American. Some 24 percent of Waterproof residents in 2010 were aged sixty or above.

Waterproof is approximately north of Ferriday, one of the two principal communities of Concordia Parish. The village is named for its relative safety from flooding prior to construction of the Mississippi River levee system.

With a population dependent on agriculture, the rural village struggles with poverty. Mechanization has decreased the need for farm labor. Industrial-scale cotton is the major commodity crop, but corn and soybeans are also important.

==History==

===20th century to present===
Jim Crow rules were strong through the segregation era, and the Ku Klux Klan was active in southwest Louisiana through the late 20th century. Although there were 7,000 blacks living in the parish in 1964, none had been registered to vote. The 4,000 whites controlled parish and city politics for decades. The first 15 blacks were registered to vote in 1964, after passage of national civil rights legislation.

Three young Waterproof men died in action in the Vietnam War: Carl Raymond Goodfellow, a navy ensign; Robert Lee Ross, an army private; and Douglas Mac Washington, an army sergeant.

As of 1990, Waterproof hosted &quot;a general store, a grocery, two gas stations, two banks and the Western Auto franchise&quot;.

The village has the Tensas Parish Detention Center South. This prison facility holds inmates sentenced in Waterproof and Tensas Parish courts and courts of other cities in the Tensas Parish area. It has recently been used to detain undocumented immigrants. The listed address of Tensas Parish Detention Center South is 8606 Highway 65.

On December 8, 2018, the village elected its youngest mayor in history, Jarrod Randell Bottley, an African American male. He was 31 years old at the time and serves the town on a full-time basis.

===Case against mayor and police chief===
In September 2006 Bobby D. Higginbotham was elected as mayor of Waterproof. After taking office, he hired Miles Jenkins as chief of police. Both native to Waterproof, the two African-American men had also lived and worked for years in other cities, including New Orleans. Jenkins had a 30-year career in the US military and earned a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Troy University in Alabama. He started to professionalize the small town police department.

On July 24, 2007, Parish Sheriff Rickey A. Jones, who is white, arrested Higginbotham on counts of impersonating a police officer, criminal trespass, and felony criminal damage to property. Higginbotham claimed that Jones arrested him in order to prevent his running for sheriff again in the October 20, 2007, non-partisan blanket primary. Jones said he incurred $7,500 in legal fees before he took office as sheriff because Higginbotham sued him over allegations of a &quot;rigged&quot; election. In the 2007 primary, Jones defeated Higginbotham, 2,188 votes (77.6 percent) to 631 votes (22.4 percent).

Jones and District Attorney James E. Paxton of the Louisiana 6th Judicial District, who was elected in 2008, recognized Caldwell A. Flood Jr., as the bona fide mayor of Waterproof. Police chief Miles Perkins was also arrested and charged for profiting from traffic tickets.

In March 2010, Police Chief Miles Jenkins filed a lawsuit asserting conspiracy by Jones, Paxton, and other members of the white power structure to prevent the legal exercise of power by black elected officials. He said that he and Higginbotham were illegally forced from office and prosecuted by white officials. He cited numerous arrests by Jones and prosecution by Paxton, on charges that observers said they had never heard used against a police official. The case was closely watched by civil rights activists.

Although the village is 55% black, Higginbotham was convicted by a jury of 11 whites and one black in 2010 of two charges: malfeasance in office and felony theft. He was sentenced to five years of hard labor, two years suspended, for malfeasance and seven years hard labor, three years suspended, for felony theft. The conviction was reversed and the sentence was vacated by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2012, based on trial irregularities, including missing witness testimonies. Higginbotham had been freed on parole for good behavior in December 2011. The Louisiana State Supreme Court denied a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot;. In 2016, the US Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, upheld the District Court decision denying habeas relief.

<text>Houma ( ) is the largest city in and the parish seat of Terrebonne Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana. It is also the largest principal city of the Houma–Bayou Cane–Thibodaux metropolitan statistical area. The city&#x27;s government was absorbed by the parish in 1984, which currently operates as the Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government.

The population was 33,727 at the 2010 census, an increase of 1,334 over the 2000 census tabulation of 32,393. In 2020, the population estimates program determined 32,467 people lived in the city. At the 2020 census, its population rebounded to 33,406. Many unincorporated areas are adjacent to the city of Houma. The largest, Bayou Cane, is an urbanized area commonly referred to by locals as being part of Houma, but it is not included in the city&#x27;s census counts, and is a separate census-designated place. If the populations of the urbanized census-designated places were included with that of the city of Houma, the total would exceed 60,000 residents.

== Etymology ==
The city was named after the historic Native American tribe of Houma people, believed to be related to the Choctaw. The United Houma Nation is recognized by the state of Louisiana, but it has not achieved federal recognition.

==History==
Settled by the Chitimacha and then the Houma Indians prior to European colonization, Houma was soon named for the Houma Indians who were at Ouiski Point. Land claimed for the Houma Indians by the Spanish was not recognized by the United States after the Louisiana Purchase.

Present-day Houma was formed in 1832; the city was incorporated in 1848. The area was developed for sugar cane plantations in the antebellum years. Plantations were sited along the rivers and bayous in order to have access to water transportation.

===Reconstruction to present===
Sugar cane continued to be important after the war and into the 20th century.

On January 24, 1970, an accidental gas explosion killed three people and caused extensive damage downtown. Latour&#x27;s Jewelry Store was destroyed.

In 1984, the city and parish consolidated their governments. In 2008, Bill Ellzey, a columnist at &quot;Houma Today&quot;, wrote that area residents were often unaware of the Houma city boundaries as the city and parish governments had consolidated.

In late August 2021, Houma was struck by the intense eye wall of category 4 Hurricane Ida, causing widespread damage.

==Geography==
Houma is located at (29.587614, -90.716108) and has an elevation of above sea level. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.92%, is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild, sometimes warm winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Houma has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 33,406 people, 12,612 households, and 7,970 families residing in the city.

According to the 2019 American Community Survey, the racial and ethnic makeup of the city was 62.1% non-Hispanic white, 23.3% Black or African American, 0.3% Asian alone, 0.1% some other race, 3.9% two or more races, and 4.3% Hispanic and Latin American of any race. At the 2010 census, the racial make up of the city was 67.46% White American, 20.62% Black or African American, 5.45% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.71% Asian, 0.12% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 0.68% from other races, and 1.87% from two or more races; Hispanics and Latin Americans of any race were 5.76% of the population.

In 2019, the median age was 36.8. Of the population aged 18 and older, they made 75.9% of the demographic; 8.1% of the population were aged 5 and under; 14.6% were aged 65 and older. The median income for a household at the 2019 American Community Survey was $42,949 and 23.8% of the population lived at or below the poverty line.

==Education==
Terrebonne Parish School District operates the city and parish public schools. Houma is home to Louisiana&#x27;s second-oldest high school, Terrebonne High School. South Terrebonne High School was founded in 1961. H.L. Bourgeois High School, Ellender Memorial High School and Vandebilt Catholic High School are also in Terrebonne Parish. Southdown High School (originally Houma Colored High School) was constructed in the mid-20th century as a segregated school for black students, serving them exclusively from 1946 to 1969. After that the school was integrated as a result of 1964 civil rights legislation.

==Culture==
Houma and the surrounding communities are steeped in the French, Native, Cajun, African and Creole history of the region. Originally the region was colonized by French and Spanish who made their way south through Bayou Lafourche. In the late 18th century, numerous Acadians (later known as Cajuns) settled in the region. The Acadians had been expelled by the British from Nova Scotia during the Seven Years&#x27; War for their unwillingness to take a loyalty oath to the British King. The number expelled was about 15,000 in number, of which 3,000 eventually settled in this region. Others went to France. As the French, Spanish, Acadians and Native American people mixed over the decades, a unique Cajun culture was born.

The swampland around Houma resulted in the area being quite isolated from the rest of Louisiana and the United States well into the 1930. Outside influences such as radio and concomitant popular culture failed to penetrate Cajun culture, so Cajun culture and the use of French language in this region persevered much longer than in cities on the border of Cajun country, such as Lake Charles or Baton Rouge. Traditional Cajun culture in Houma includes the French language, Cajun cuisine, and celebration of Catholic festivals such as Mardi Gras. That folk culture remains evident today and attracts many tourists to the region.

In the 1970s, many South Vietnamese refugees emigrated following the reunification of Vietnam. They settled in Southern Louisiana to work as shrimpers, just as they had in Vietnam. A fairly significant portion of them settled in New Orleans, and many settled in Houma as well, in addition to elsewhere along the Gulf Coast. Many ethnic Vietnamese families still work at shrimping, as their families have for several decades.

Downtown Houma has been designated as an historic district and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It offers a downtown walking tour and attractions such as the Bayou Terrebonne Waterlife Museum, the Folklife Culture Center, the Regional Military Museum, Southdown Plantation, the Houma-Terrebonne Civic Center, monuments to local armed forces, and local eateries.

Although Houma is quickly changing, many residents in the surrounding communities continue to make their living from the Gulf as their ancestors did. They harvest shrimp, oyster, crab, fish, and engage in trapping, although more have shifted to work in occupations of the oil industry and shipbuilding. According to the United States Government Patent and Trademark Office, Houma, Louisiana was the site of the deepest oil well in Terrebonne Parish.

Tab Benoit&#x27;s Voice of the Wetlands Music Festival, established in 2005, takes place in Houma, annually in October.

==Media==
The local newspaper is &quot;The Courier&quot;, founded in 1878 as &quot;Le Courrier de Houma&quot; by the French-born Lafayette Bernard Filhucan Bazet. He first published it in four-page, half-French half-English editions. Sold to The New York Times Company in 1980, it is now part of GateHouse Media.

The &quot;Houma Times&quot; is located in Houma. The newspaper is a weekly publication with a website updated daily. It serves the Terrebonne, Lafourche, and St. Mary parishes. In 2014, Houma-based Rushing Media merged with Guidry Group, Inc., which had owned the publication since its inception in 1997.

The area&#x27;s only local broadcast TV station, KFOL-CD, is located in Houma. KFOL, also known as HTV, produces a weeknight newscast, followed by local phone calls and guests. Other shows include &quot;Sportsman&#x27;s Paradise&quot; and &quot;One on One&quot;. KFOL broadcasts in digital on channel 30.1. The statewide TV network LCN-TV produces original Louisiana programming which showcases Louisiana&#x27;s entertainment, culture, talent and industry. LCN-TV is delivered to all media distributors. Debuted in 2007, LCN-TV continues to produce Louisiana TV shows for the U.S.

The following radio stations are located in the Houma-Thibodaux metropolitan area, though several stations licensed to Houma also serve New Orleans and cover all of southeastern Louisiana:

<text>Bernice is a town in Union Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,689 at the 2010 census, a decrease from 1,809 in 2000. It is part of the Monroe Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The area was part of the Louisiana frontier and pine forests, but early houses survive from the mid-nineteenth century: among the oldest homes are the R.T. Moore/Gresham/Stenzel House, known as the &quot;Sweet Onion&quot;, and McCuller Log Cabin, both circa 1865.

Bernice was established in 1899 as a sawmill town after Captain C.C. Henderson built the Arkansas Southern Railroad, the first railway in Union Parish. Also an agricultural trade center, Bernice is the youngest European-American town to be founded in the parish. The area was known as the &quot;big woods&quot; because of its large stands of huge virgin pine. Henderson built the railroad to enable harvesting of lumber from the area. Moving south from Junction City, he directed construction of the railroad to Winnfield.

Henderson sought to purchase property about a mile north of the present town from Henry Mabry, but they could not agree on the price. Henderson moved south and bought land from Allen Lowery and Dave Cole. He named his acquisition for Lowery&#x27;s infant daughter, Bernice. On a late spring day, Henderson auctioned lots for the planned community.

Bernice was incorporated that same year, and the railroad depot was built soon after. A 1901 picture of Louisiana Street includes the depot, and a c. 1905 interior photograph shows the agent and several local citizens. Restored, today the station is operated as the Depot Museum, displaying a collection of Bernice memorabilia. It also serves as a tourist information center.

Jake Crews was the first mayor. He was a contractor who built many of the earliest homes. Still standing are his own 1900 house, now called the Caldwell Home and said to be the oldest house in town; the 1902 Garland/Reeder House; the 1903 J.W. Heard/Laurence/Patton House; and the 1904 Thomas Heard House. Other turn-of-the century structures are the Cook/Minter House, the John Roach House and the Rives/Lindsey Hotel. The first brick home in town was the Pollock/Martin House, which dates from the 1920s, as does the old Bernice Jail.

The circa 1895 Alabama Methodist Church is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Lynn Log House was moved to its present location and reconstructed from an antebellum dogtrot house that once stood across the road.

Captain Henderson donated land to the town to be named Oakhurst Park. It was filled with oak trees surrounding a gazebo where public functions were held during the early years. In 1938, the Bernice Clubhouse was built in the park, and it remains in use today. Nearby was the childhood home of New York Knicks basketball great Willis Reed.

The original town, as laid out by Henderson, has recently been designated as the Bernice Historic District by the town council.

The first store was in a tent and run by a man named Nelson, and the next was a mercantile business in a box car, operated by Will Martin. Other merchants soon followed, many of them coming from Shiloh, and the Bank of Bernice was chartered in 1901. With lumber the major factor in the economy, usually one mill, and often two, have operated here. A saloon and pool hall were among the early businesses, and it was not unusual to see a fight among lumbermen on Saturday afternoons in the middle of the red dirt main street under the sycamore trees. In the early part of the century, the Bernice and Northwestern Railroad Company, also known as &quot;the dummy line&quot;, headed northwesterly toward Summerfield to haul in the logs from the lumber camps along the way.

Although Bernice has changed from its rough and tumble early days, it still has a sawmill and a chip mill operating. The Lindsey warehouse complex of 63 buildings provides space for several timber-related industries. The town also has a hospital, a nursing home, a volunteer fire department, several churches, and numerous small businesses.

An 1895 map of Union Parish claims that a post office was operating since 1848, as well as the fact that the settlement was known as &quot;Spears Store&quot; at one point in time.

<text>Abbeville is a city in, and the parish seat of, Vermilion Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 12,257 at the 2010 census. At the 2020 population estimates program, the population of the city was 11,927. It is located southwest of Lafayette.

== History ==
Formerly called La Chapelle, the land that became Abbeville was purchased by founding father Père Antoine Désiré Mégret (&quot;Père&quot; is French for &quot;Father&quot;), a Capuchin missionary on July 25, 1843, for $900. There are two hypotheses as to how the town was named. The more generally accepted hypothesis is that Mégret named the town after his home in France. The second hypothesis states that it is a combination of &quot;Abbé&quot; (the French word for &quot;Abbot&quot;) for Abbé Mégret, and &quot;ville&quot; (the French word for &quot;Town&quot;) – hence Abbé&#x27;s town. Some support for the second theory can be found in the fact that the town in France is pronounced differently (as &quot;Abbville&quot;) by its denizens. However, in 1995, Jean Desobry discovered in the diocesan archives of Amiens evidence that Antoine Jacques Désiré Mégret was born on May 23, 1797, in Abbeville, France, thus confirming the first hypothesis. Dr Mary-Theresa MacCarthy wrote in her article &quot;Un Autre Abbeville&quot; in the 1996 edition of Bulletin de la Société des Antiquaires de Picardie (translation by Father Herbert),

On February 12, 1844, the pastor gave to his American town the name of the town of his birth. Residents find this name especially fitting because of the French word abbé which means father [or priest] added to the French word ville [which means town]. Their Abbeville is truly la ville de l&#x27;abbé [the priest&#x27;s town].

Settlers were primarily descendants of the Acadians from Nova Scotia that moved to the area from 1766 to 1775. The town was incorporated in 1850.
There were two people living on the land at the time, Joseph LeBlanc and his wife Isabelle Broussard, whose former home Father Megret converted into a chapel. The chapel burned in 1854 and, in 1910, St. Mary Magdalen Catholic Church was built, which still stands today.

Father Megret modeled his original plan for the village after a French Provincial village. In a map he designed in 1846, the town was 38 to in size. It was bounded on the north by St. Victor Boulevard, on the south by Lafayette Boulevard, on the east by &quot;the Sisters of Charity&quot;, and on the west by Bayou Vermilion. At this point in time the town was called &quot;Abbville&quot;.

The center of downtown is Magdalen Square, which is accented by large oak trees, a fountain, and gazebo. A statue in memory of Father Megret stands in the square. In 1856, the Last Island Hurricane destroyed every building in the town.

<text>Erath is a town in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 2,114 at the 2010 census, and 2,030 at the 2020 population estimates program. It is part of the Abbeville micropolitan statistical area and the Lafayette metropolitan area.

==History==
Erath is named after August Erath (March 18, 1843 - September 11, 1900) who emigrated from Switzerland to New Orleans in 1860 and was a bookkeeper in the breweries. He moved to New Iberia in 1876 and erected a brewery there. Erath was later mayor of New Iberia and began to develop land in the Erath area. Although August Erath never lived in Erath, he was close to railroad officials, which brought forth a great business venture for him. Later, Erath built a seltzer water factory in New Iberia and an ice plant in Abbeville. In 1884, he started a hardware business and purchased land located in this area.

In 2005, storm surge forced inland by Hurricane Rita flooded most of the town. Water in most parts of town was up to six feet deep.

==Geography==
Erath is located at (29.959939, -92.035220). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Erath is located south of Lafayette, parish seat of Lafayette Parish via Louisiana Highway 339, east of Abbeville, parish seat of Vermilion Parish, and west of New Iberia, parish seat of Iberia Parish via Louisiana Highway 14. The eastern edge of Erath borders with the town of Delcambre on LA-14.

==Demographics==

The 2020 United States census counted 2,028 people, 830 households, and 509 families in Erath. The population density was 1,154.2 per square mile (445.7/km). There were 928 housing units at an average density of 528.2 per square mile (203.9/km). The racial makeup was 84.12% (1,706) white or European American (83.53% non-Hispanic white), 6.41% (130) black or African-American, 0.3% (6) Native American or Alaska Native, 4.39% (89) Asian, 0.0% (0) Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, 0.49% (10) from other races, and 4.29% (87) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race was 2.56% (52) of the population.

Of the 830 households, 35.8% had children under the age of 18; 36.4% were married couples living together; 38.0% had a female householder with no spouse or partner present. 31.7% of households consisted of individuals and 14.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.5 and the average family size was 3.0. The percent of those with a bachelor’s degree or higher was estimated to be 15.3% of the population.

25.4% of the population was under the age of 18, 8.3% from 18 to 24, 24.5% from 25 to 44, 25.0% from 45 to 64, and 16.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39.0 years. For every 100 females, there were 115.5 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older, there were 125.0 males.

The 2016-2020 5-year American Community Survey estimates show that the median household income was $37,198 (with a margin of error of +/- $10,630) and the median family income was $40,341 (+/- $16,273). Males had a median income of $41,250 (+/- $16,514) versus $25,595 (+/- $5,021) for females. The median income for those above 16 years old was $29,938 (+/- $5,893). Approximately, 16.1% of families and 17.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 21.8% of those under the age of 18 and 23.3% of those ages 65 or over.

==Economy==
Erath is home to Henry Hub, an important junction of natural gas pipeline systems. Natural gas prices in North America are more or less set at this junction.

The &quot;Henry&quot; hub is so named for its location in the Henry hamlet of Erath, which was named after the Henry High School that stood there until damage from flooding due to Hurricane Rita forced its closure and demolition. This school was named for its benefactor, William Henry, who originally immigrated from Copenhagen, Denmark as Ludwig Wilhelm Kattentidt, circa 1840, then dropped the surname and used his father&#x27;s middle &#x27;Heinrich&#x27; for his surname of Henry. There are Henry descendants in the area to this day.

It was customary for benefactors to sponsor schools; there were quite a few similarly sponsored schools in Vermilion Parish around that time. Being that long ago and in a rural area, with schools sometimes sponsored even in homes, there was great variation in what was offered to how many, and it often changed over time. Records say that the Henry school was founded in 1877, and apparently became a high school in 1896 because it celebrated its centennial in 1996.

In 1992, the Vermilion Parish school district reorganized the schools. Students transferred to Erath High, and Henry High became an elementary school. Then on September 24, 2005 (less than a month after Hurricane Katrina), Hurricane Rita smashed the parish and ruined the school. The area was also hit hard three years later by Hurricane Ike, and the main building was finally razed around March 2009. Likewise, St. John Catholic Church across the street had its rectory damaged; it is being replaced with a new building elevated to meet new flood standards as of early 2014.

When land for the Henry school was bequeathed, it was stipulated for education into perpetuity, or to be returned to the heirs. The gymnasium was salvaged and is still used by the school district to this day. A Google Earth comparison of, for example, February 28, 2006, to April 23, 2012, at the intersection of Highways 330 and 689 shows a parking lot where the main school was, and the church&#x27;s rectory gone, but the gymnasium in clear use by child sports organizations and other groups.

<text>Gueydan (local pronunciation [ge(ɪ)dɔ̃]) is a town in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,398 at the 2010 census, down from 1,598 in 2000. At the 2020 population estimates program, its population decreased to 1,328. It is part of the Abbeville micropolitan statistical area.

==History==

For thousands of years, indigenous peoples lived along the waterways of Louisiana. They were able to hunt plentiful game and harvest fish from the rivers. In historic times, this area was inhabited by the Attakapa and Chitimacha.

In the early 1860s, Jean Pierre Gueydan, (originally spelled &quot;Guédon&quot;) the founder of the European-American town, lived in Abbeville, Louisiana, about 30 miles east of present-day Gueydan. As had the Attapaka and earlier American Indian tribes, he often came to this area to hunt deer, ducks, geese, pheasant, &quot;cache-cache&quot; (jack snipe), &quot;papabottes&quot;, and other game. The area was a hunter&#x27;s paradise.

In 1884, the brothers Jean-Pierre and François Gueydan purchased forty thousand acres (160 km2) of land described by surveyors as &quot;sea marsh, unfit for cultivation&quot;, for twelve and one-half cents per acre. By 1896, a small portion of their purchase became known as the &quot;Gueydan Pasture&quot;. It was chartered as a village when the population reached 250. Jean Pierre was considered the official founder of Gueydan, as by then he had purchased his brother&#x27;s landholdings. In 1902, the settlement became the town of Gueydan. Many residents were involved in the cultivation of rice along the waterways, as the area&#x27;s most important commodity crop.

Realizing the importance of a railroad to the rice farmers, Gueydan donated a section of land and extensive right-of-way to induce the Southern Pacific Railroad to build a branch line from Midland, Louisiana. Shortly after, he offered the first property lots for sale. Settlers began to arrive from other parts of the state and the rest of the country.

The first irrigation pump in the state of Louisiana was built nearby at Primeaux Landing. This enabled water to be pumped to irrigate thousands of acres of rice. With the pump, the area grew as a producer of rice. In the late 19th century, farmers recruited Italian immigrants as laborers, but they quickly left the role of farm workers. Some established local businesses, such as groceries, barber shops and tailors, in small towns across Louisiana.

The founder Jean Pierre Gueydan lived at his plantation, St. Bennette, about two miles south of the community. In 1894 the plantation house was used to house the town&#x27;s first school, which opened with 10 students.

The town of Gueydan suffered numerous near catastrophes. Fires in 1901, 1903, 1910, and 1927 caused extensive damage. The worst tragedy was the Flood of 1940. After near-record rainfalls in August 1940, the entire town was inundated. Locals still vividly recall the disaster. The area had extensive flooding because it is nearly flat prairie, with an average elevation of only nine feet above the Gulf of Mexico. The elevation tends to be in the range of 5 to 12 feet.

The whole area was once low marshy land, now called wetlands, subject to overflow by the waters of the nearby Mermentau River. This area was filled with trees and bushes that thrived in those conditions and could absorb much water during times of seasonal flooding. Developers created a modern system of canals for drainage purposes and irrigation as early as 1901, but these interfered with the natural processes of the wetlands. Development of the town and rice culture further reduced the natural capacity of the wetlands to absorb flooding, as well as creating a built-up area of residences and businesses where flooding was a threat.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Gueydan has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="115818" wikidata="Q3070165" url="?curid=115818" title="Hornbeck, Louisiana">
<text>Hornbeck is a town in Vernon Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 480 at the 2010 census, up from 435 in 2000. It is part of the Fort Johnson South Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
As early as the 1830s people settled in the area now known as Hornbeck, but a town didn’t begin to form until 1897, when an agent for the Arkansas Town Site Company named F.A. Hornbeck purchased land along the Kansas City Southern Railroad (KCS) for $8,640. Structures necessary for servicing locomotives were constructed as well as a brick kiln to supply bricks for construction.

In 1897, the first Post Office opened in the area with Walter Carey as the first postmaster and later that same year he was succeeded by D.B. Pate.

The first public school in Hornbeck opened in 1898, with Miss Fannie Monk and W.L. Ford serving as the primary and grammar school teachers. The first secondary school opened in 1907 with G.S. Graybeal serving as its principal, then in 1910 the school became an affiliated high school.

On October 21, 1902, Governor William Wright Heard issued a proclamation declaring that Section 16, Township 4, North Range 10 West was incorporated as Hornbeck; with W.M. Conerly appointed mayor and G.G. Leach, W.L. Maddox and John Carter appointed aldermen; W. Johnson became the town marshal.

Kansas City Southern Railroad established a presence in Hornbeck with the construction of the roundhouse, which allowed for the servicing of engines. The presence of the roundhouse contributed to making Hornbeck a significant junction between Port Arthur, Texas and Shreveport as well as providing an abundance of jobs and influencing the town’s growth. The early twentieth century was a prosperous time for Hornbeck with both the timber and railroad industries having an established presence in the area. Hornbeck became a bustling little town, with a bank, a newspaper, five hotels, five saloons and ten retail stores.

In 1912, KCS decided to move the roundhouse to Leesville; this decision was disastrous for Hornbeck’s economy, with the town surviving on the timber, turpentine and farming industries for nearly two more decades. However, when the Great Depression hit in late 1929 it caused the timber and turpentine industries to collapse and brought an abrupt end to Hornbeck’s prosperity.

In the 1940s the Department of War established Camp Polk and conducted what became known as the “Louisiana Maneuvers.” The location of Camp Polk in Vernon Parish helped to stimulate Hornbeck’s economy as well as that of the entire region, especially Vernon Parish.

In the 1960s, with the construction of Toledo Bend Reservoir on the Sabine River, Hornbeck gained an asset and started promoting itself as the “Gateway” to Toledo Bend.

Today, Hornbeck has maintained modest growth, with its elected officials taking a pro-active approach to economic development. On October 21, 2002, Hornbeck celebrated its 100th anniversary.

<doc id="115824" wikidata="Q890366" url="?curid=115824" title="Bogalusa, Louisiana">
<text>Bogalusa ( ) is a city in Washington Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 12,232 at the 2010 census. In the 2020 census the city reported a population of 10,659. It is the principal city of the Bogalusa Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Washington Parish and is also part of the larger New Orleans–Metairie–Hammond combined statistical area.

The name of the city derives from the Choctaw language term &quot;bogue lusa&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;dark water or &quot;smoky water&quot;. Located in an area of pine forests, in the early 20th century, this industrial city was developed as a company town, to provide worker housing and services in association with a Great Southern Lumber Company sawmill. In the late 1930s, this operation was replaced with paper mills and chemical operations.

== History ==
===Founding===
Incorporated in 1914, Bogalusa is one of the youngest towns in Louisiana. It was founded by Frank Henry Goodyear and Charles Waterhouse Goodyear, lumber barons of Buffalo, New York. In the early 1900s, the brothers bought hundreds of thousands of acres of virgin Longleaf pine forests in southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi for the timber and further their strategy to build railroad spurs to bring the wood to market. In 1902, they chartered the Great Southern Lumber Company (1908–38) and built the first sawmill in what became Bogalusa, a company town built to support the mill. The sawmill was the largest in the world at the time. The Goodyear interests built the city of Bogalusa to house workers and supervisors, and associated infrastructure. They also built the Great Northern New Orleans Railroad to New Orleans to transport their lumber and products to market.
The city, designed by architect Rathbone DeBuys of New Orleans and built from the ground up in less than a year, had several hotels, schools, a hospital, a YMCA and YWCA, churches of all faiths, and houses for the mill workers. The town was laid out with the &quot;Mill Town&quot; on the south side and &quot;Commercial Town&quot; on the north side, altogether there were four quadrants with racially segregated neighborhoods defined by the railroad running north–south and Bogue Lusa Creek running east–west. It was called the &quot;Magic City&quot; in praise of its rapid construction. The manager of Great Southern Lumber Company was William H. Sullivan. As sawmill manager, he acted as town boss when the city was built. After Bogalusa was incorporated as a city on July 4, 1914, Sullivan was elected as mayor by white voters (blacks had been disenfranchised), and repeatedly re-elected, serving until his death on June 26, 1929.

The Great Southern Lumber Company&#x27;s sprawling sawmill produced up to a million board feet (2400 m3) of lumber each day. With the virgin pine forest cleared, the sawmill closed in 1938 during the Great Depression. An attempt to keep the sawmill open with California redwood proved too costly, and the mill was closed. It was replaced by the Bogalusa Paper Company (a subsidiary of Great Southern). In 1937 Bogalusa Paper Company merged with Gaylord Container Corporation; a chemical plant also run by Gaylord was built next to the mill. Crown-Zellerbach acquired Gaylord&#x27;s operations in 1955. The paper mill and chemical operations continued to anchor the city&#x27;s economy.

At its peak in 1960, the city had more than 21,000 residents. In 1985 Crown-Zellerbach was split up but the timber industry continued.

===Racial conflicts===
In 1919 workers went on strike, triggering the largest labor strife at the town&#x27;s Great Southern Lumber Company, the largest sawmill in the world. Company owners supported a white militia group and brought in Black strikebreakers, increasing racial tension. Events culminated in the Bogalusa sawmill killings which saw four union men killed. On August 31, 1919, Black veteran Lucius McCarty was accused of assaulting a white woman and a mob of some 1,500 people seized McCarty and shot him more than 1,000 times. The mob then dragged his corpse behind a car through the black neighborhoods before burning his body in a bonfire.

===Civil rights era===
Industrial workers of both races arrived in the company town for employment from the early 20th century onwards. Following their return from World War II, African-American veterans faced significant challenges due to racial discrimination and violence in Louisiana and the broader South. They contended with the enduring legacy of Jim Crow laws, state-enforced segregation, and systemic disenfranchisement and political exclusion, issues that had persisted since the turn of the 20th century.

During the civil rights era, African-American employees at Crown Zellerbach in Bogalusa campaigned for equal employment opportunities, including access to all job positions and advancements into supervisory roles. This push for equality met resistance from white coworkers. Additionally, the African-American community advocated for the integration of public facilities in Bogalusa, particularly following the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, facing opposition from segments of the local population.

The struggle against racial discrimination extended beyond black workers challenging the industrial class system. Local Ku Klux Klan members exerted their influence by intimidating civil rights activists. The situation escalated in 1964 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, as whites intensified their opposition. Lou Major, publisher of &quot;Bogalusa Daily News&quot;, became a notable target, experiencing a cross burning in his yard by the Klan, a stark manifestation of the Klan&#x27;s efforts to silence advocates for equality and justice.

Determined to fight for their rights, Bob Hicks, Charles Sims, A.Z. Young, and others had taken leadership of the (all-black) Bogalusa Civic and Voters&#x27; League. On February 21, 1965, with the help of three activists from the Deacons for Defense and Justice based in Jonesboro, Louisiana, they founded the first affiliated chapter of that African-American self-defense organization. Other leaders of the Deacons were Bert Wyre, Aurilus “Reeves” Perkins, Sam Bonds, Fletcher Anderson, and others. They mobilized many war veterans within the black community to provide armed security to civil rights activists and their families. Expecting a violent summer, the State Police established an office in Bogalusa in February 1965.

As explained by Seth Hague, 
...the community came to embrace the militant rhetoric of the Jonesboro Deacons. Many violent conflicts ensued under this ideology and culminated in a climactic summer in 1965. Consequently, the black workers’ militancy threatened not only the power of the middle class blacks, but also the political and economic hegemony of the white power structure in Bogalusa. Except for a few noteworthy courtroom &quot;victories&quot; versus Crown-Zellerbach, threatening the power structure was virtually the struggle&#x27;s only effect as the white power structure subsumed the militancy and rhetoric of the revolutionary Bogalusans.&quot;

Two of the most notable murders of African Americans that took place in Bogalusa during the civil rights era were Oneal Moore, who was killed in 1965, the first black deputy sheriff hired for the Washington Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and Clarence Triggs, who was killed in 1966.

===1970 to present===
With changes in the lumber industry, through the late 20th century, after 1960, a steady decline in industrial operations, jobs, and associated population of the town occurred. By 2015, the population was estimated at slightly less than 12,000, more than 40% below the high in 1960. These conditions have made it more difficult for remaining residents.

In 1995, a railroad tank car imploded at Gaylord Chemical Corporation, releasing nitrogen tetroxide and forcing the evacuation of about 3,000 people within a one-mile (1.6 km) radius. Residents say &quot;the sky turned orange&quot; as a result. Emergency rooms filled with about 4,000 people who complained of burning eyes, skin, and lungs. Dozens of lawsuits were filed against Gaylord Chemical and were finally settled in May 2005, with compensation checks issued to around 20,000 people affected by the accident.

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the city with winds of about , downing numerous trees and power lines. Many buildings in Bogalusa were damaged from falling trees, and several were destroyed. Most of the houses, businesses, and other buildings suffered roof damage from the storm&#x27;s ferocious winds. Some outlying areas of the city were without power for more than a month.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.52%) is covered by water.

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Bogalusa has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Bogalusa was on June 20, 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 12, 1962.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 10,659 people, 4,874 households, and 2,923 families residing in the city.

===Crime===
With a crime rate of 60 per one thousand residents, Bogalusa has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes- from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One&#x27;s chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 17. Within Louisiana, more than 92% of the communities have a lower crime rate than Bogalusa.

==Economy==
Bogalusa&#x27;s economy has been linked to lumbering and its byproducts since the city&#x27;s founding by the Great Southern Lumber Company chartered in 1902 by the Goodyears of Buffalo, New York. The sawmill was, for many years, the largest in the world. A paper mill was added in 1918. By 1938, the Goodyear family&#x27;s mill had clear cut all the virgin longleaf yellow pine within hundreds of miles of Bogalusa and after an unprofitable effort to import redwood from California, their sawmill operations at the Great Southern Lumber Company also ended. Bogalusa&#x27;s industry then shifted to paper milling as Goodyear&#x27;s sawmill passed onto Gaylord Container Corporation which was then bought by Crown Zellerbach in 1955. By the mid 1960s the mill was producing some 1300 tons of paper daily with four machines. Georgia Pacific acquired the mill in 1986. Its brown paper successor owned the Bogalusa mill until 2002 when Gaylord was acquired by Temple-Inland Corporation, the area&#x27;s largest employer.

The spill-over of industrial products into the Pearl River in August 2011 resulted in Federal fines of over one million dollars. The following year, 2012, Temple-Inland was acquired by International Paper headquartered in Memphis, TN and the mill came under new ownership. The Bogalusa mill still operates as a corrugated fiberboard plant making boxes and shipping containers. As of 2019 the plant remains the city&#x27;s largest employer with 425 people. However production is much less than the 1960s with only two machines now in operation.

<doc id="115829" wikidata="Q2855307" url="?curid=115829" title="Dixie Inn, Louisiana">
<text>Dixie Inn is a village in Webster Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 352 at the 2000 census. It is located off Interstate 20 at the old Shreveport Road, some twenty-six miles east of Shreveport. Minden, the seat of Webster Parish, is located some three miles to the east. Dixie Inn is part of the Minden Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Most of the original houses in Dixie Inn were built during World War II to serve munitions workers at the former Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant located off U.S. Highway 80 to the east.

Dixie Inn was incorporated in 1956. Clyde A. Stanley (1910–1959) became the first mayor of the village; he defeated James Whit &quot;Tinker&quot; Volentine (1915–1982) by a vote of 69 to 54. All but seven of the registered voters participated in the election.

In January 2016, the Dixie Inn Village Council approved an , 109-A, which doubles speeding fines on residential streets. The move was initiated to stop motorists from using the back streets to avoid the traffic light at the intersection of Highways 80 and 371. Violations will henceforth cost $150, with a $2 increment for each mile over the limit.

As of January 1, 2017, Dixie Inn has an all-female village government consisting of Mayor Kay Hallmark-Stratton (No Party), elected by a one-vote margin over her female predecessor, and three Republican aldermen, Donna Suman Hoffoss, Nell Finley, and Judy McKenzie.

==Historic Antioch Baptist Church==

In 1957, Antioch opened a new brick-veneer sanctuary, the planning of which had been undertaken during the tenure of pastor Millard Robert Perkins, Sr. (1918–1979), a native of Glenmora in Rapides Parish. However, the construction was not completed until the summer of 1957, by which time Thomas E. Windsor had become the pastor. On October 20, 1957, a few months after the construction of the new sanctuary, all of the church buildings except the pastor&#x27;s residence were razed by fire. Reconstruction soon began and was completed in October 1959. Since Hearron, the full-time Antioch pastors have included Cecil Basham, J. Guy Allen, Millard Perkins, Thomas Windsor, Jack Edwin Byrd, Sr., Charles W. Wallace, and Malcolm Self (1937-2015). Wayne Reeves was called from Antioch as a pastor in Many, Louisiana.

Millard Perkins was a graduate of East Texas Baptist University in Marshall, Texas, and New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary and had been the pastor of several congregations in Texas and Louisiana, including the Gilgal Baptist Church, originally established in 1842 and based in a 1947 sanctuary located on the Old Arcadia Road near Minden. Before his death of a heart attack, he operated Perkins Grill in downtown Minden. He was survived by his wife, the former Pearl Buxton, and five children. Perkins is interred at Memorial Park Cemetery in Monroe, Louisiana.

<text>Doyline is a village in southwestern Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana, United States. The population was 818 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Minden Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Under a cited cost-saving realignment plan, the Webster Parish School Board closed Union Elementary School in Doyline in 2011, as Doyline High School absorbed the elementary students. Vandals broke windows in the abandoned elementary school, which contained asbestos and black mold. The building was hence razed at a cost of $99,000.

The HBO television series &quot;True Blood&quot; about vampires has a scene filmed in Doyline.

==History==

Doyline is an entry point to Lake Bistineau and the Lake Bistineau State Park, a popular fishing destination and the reservoir of Dorcheat Bayou.

The Doyline High School Panthers won their state basketball championship in 1967, and two of the players pursued athletic careers.

<text>Springhill is a small city in the northernmost of Webster Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 5,279 at the 2010 census, a decrease of 160 since 2000. Springhill is part of the Minden Micropolitan Statistical Area though it is thirty miles north of Minden, the seat of government of Webster Parish. The Springhill population is 34 percent African American, compared to 25 percent minority in 2000.

==History==

Webster Parish was first permanently settled about 1818 near Overton south of the parish seat of Minden. According to genealogical findings, William Farmer, Samuel Monzingo, J. A. Byrnes, and Joseph Murrell were the first settlers in the area. These settlers formed an area that was initially referred to informally as &quot;Piney Woods.&quot; In 1894, though still unincorporated, what would eventually become Springhill took the name &quot;Barefoot, Louisiana&quot; on the notions of a Mrs. Maxwell, who assigned the name based on her observations that many men in the community went to work without shoes. The town that is today Springhill was finally incorporated in 1902. The first mayor was N.B. Taylor, who followed a year thereafter by B.D. Wilson. Peter Modisette was the mayor from 1914 to 1925.

Springhill City Hall is located opposite the Springhill Civic Center, a meeting hall which cost $500,000 and was financed in the late 1960s under a voter-approved bond issue, with millage taxes levied against property owners.

More recent mayors included Ed Shultz (1942–1954), Charles McConnell (1954–1958), Jesse L. Boucher (1958–1962), James Allen (1962–1974), M. A. Gleason, Jr. (1974–1978), Johnny D. Herrington (1978–1986 and 1995–2006), a brother-in-law of Boucher, James Curtis Smith (1987–1994), and Carroll Breaux, who assumed office on January 1, 2007. Breaux, an Independent, is the first non-Democrat to serve as Springhill mayor. He unseated Herrington, 973–782, in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on September 30, 2006. Breaux was succeeded in 2019 by another No Party mayor, Ray Huddleston.

The 1979 film &quot;Five Days from Home&quot;, which was directed by and starred George Peppard, was filmed primarily in Springhill. Peppard&#x27;s third wife, Sherry Boucher, is a Springhill native; her father, Jesse L. Boucher was a businessman and developer who served as mayor of Springhill.

==Timber industry==

Springhill&#x27;s close association with the timber industry began in 1896 with the arrival of the Pine Woods Lumber Company. Springhill prospered from timber and for a time was a boomtown. The Pine Woods Lumber Company went out of business during the Great Depression, and the population of Springhill dwindled. The Pine Woods Lumber Company facility was purchased by the Frost Lumber Company, which sold to Springhill Lumber Company. The Springhill Lumber Company later became Anthony Forest Products, which remained in Springhill until 1972.

The most significant local economic force, however, was the establishment of a massive pulp paper mill in 1937 by International Paper Company. The construction of the paper mill greatly expanded the regional economic importance of Springhill and further cemented ties to the timber industry. Though technically within the town of Cullen just south of Springhill, the facility was regionally known as the &quot;Springhill paper mill.&quot; The later addition of a wood products plant and container (box) plant by International Paper further established Springhill as one of the most important manufacturing and processing centers in northern Louisiana. In 1979, International Paper closed the paper mill, which along with a significant general downturn in the petroleum industry caused a deterioration of the local economy. Though the paper mill closed, International Paper maintained its wood products and container-producing facilities. During 2006–2007, IP sold the wood products plant to its main rival, Georgia Pacific and liquidated its significant land holdings in the Springhill area. The container division, often called the &quot;box plant&quot;, remains the last remnant of International Paper in Springhill.

After it purchased the plywood mill from International Paper, Georgia Pacific closed the plant. Another major employer, Trane, which manufactures air-conditioning components, relocated to Mexico.

==Education==
Springhill has a high school, North Webster High School, formerly the Springhill Jr./Sr. High School, which housed grades seven through twelve in prior to 2011. After budget cuts and consolidation, the school now enrolls ninth through twelfth- graders from all of northern Webster Parish. All former Springhill Junior High pupils now attend school in Sarepta at North Webster Junior High School. Elementary schools, Browning Elementary and Brown Middle, remained the same after consolidation. PK-5th grade pupils in Springhill still attend these schools.

The former campus of the Georgia Howell Elementary School, built in 1956, has been closed because of unsafe building conditions. The pupils formerly assigned there now attend Browning or Brown Middle.

<text>Port Allen is a city in, and the parish seat of, West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, United States. Located on the west bank of the Mississippi River, it is bordered by Interstate 10 and US Highway 190. The population was 4,939 in 2020. It is part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area.

Port Allen is home to the Mississippi Riverfront Development, which provides a panoramic view of the Mississippi River and Baton Rouge, the West Baton Rouge Museum, the City of Port Allen Railroad Depot, Scott&#x27;s Cemetery, the Port of Greater Baton Rouge, and the Port Allen Lock.

== History ==

=== Pre-history ===
The village of La Ville De St. Michel or San Miguel (1790–1817) had existed in a nearby location to what is now the city of Port Allen. Around the 1850s, a new community had started around the same location and went by the name Town of West Baton Rouge.

=== Founding of Port Allen ===
The city of Port Allen was founded in 1878. The name Port Allen is in honor of Henry Watkins Allen, a member of the American Confederate States Army and the 17th Governor of Louisiana. Allen was instrumental in the early years of the village, prior to the founding of the city, he had owned a slave-worked sugar plantation in town he had started in 1855, the Allendale Plantation, and he created his own railroad that ran through the village.

=== Nearby Sunrise ===
Around 1878, a former slave named Alex Banes was creating a small community called Sunrise, which existed just north of what is now Port Allen. Many of the inhabitants of Sunrise worked at the railroad Anchorage Depot; by 1900 the depot had been moved taking much of the community&#x27;s population with it. In 1918, Sunrise had a fire that destroyed much of the town and businesses, and as a result the area integrated into the neighboring town, which by then was known as Port Allen.

=== Industrialization and growth ===
By 1916, the city had incorporated. On August 10, 1940, the Huey P. Long Bridge at U.S. Route 190 was unveiled, which joined the east and west parishes, and shaping the city towards and aiding commerce and industries. Over time there was economic shifts away from agricultural and towards industrial, and in the 1950s factories and manufacturing plants were built in town. In 1963, the town population reached 5,000 and it was renamed as a city. 

For many years the city was racially segregated.

<text>St. Francisville is a town in and the parish seat of, West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,557 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The current town of St. Francisville was established on May 11, 1807, by John H. Johnson, and was originally known as the Villa of St. Francis. A number of historic structures from that period still exist. Called &quot;the town two miles long and two yards wide&quot; because it was developed atop a narrow ridge overlooking the Mississippi River, it was the commercial and cultural center of the surrounding plantation country. Below St. Francisville&#x27;s bluffs, another early settlement called &quot;Bayou Sara&quot; had been established by French colonists in the early 1790s. It was at one time the largest antebellum Mississippi River port between New Orleans and Memphis, but was superseded by Natchez. The settlement was gradually destroyed by repeated flooding and fires, and nothing exists of Bayou Sara today. A few of its surviving structures were hauled up the hill into St. Francisville in the 1920s. This area and other former French-controlled territories east of the Mississippi River was taken over by Great Britain after it defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1763.

At the end of the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain ceded what it called West Florida to Spain in 1783, as part of the Treaty of Paris. There were years of contention as to exactly where the eastern boundary of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase was—depending on which treaty was cited, as France, Great Britain, and Spain had redrawn the boundaries among themselves during the second half of the 18th century. Spain continued to claim territory on the eastern side of the Mississippi River until it and the United States settled this issue in the Pinckney Treaty. This region is today called the Florida Parishes.

In 1810, St. Francisville served as the capital of the Republic of West Florida, when area planters ousted the Spanish government of the Baton Rouge District and set up their own independent republic for 74 days, before being annexed to the Territory of Orleans, as a possession of the United States.

In 1824, when Feliciana Parish was split into East and West, St. Francisville became the seat of West Feliciana Parish&#x27;s government.

In June 1863, Confederate Army officer William Walter Leake arranged for the burial here of Union Navy officer John E. Hart, who had died aboard his ship while taking part in the Union blockade of the Mississippi River. This event is re-enacted every June during a three-day commemoration called &quot;The Day the War Stopped.&quot;

After the American Civil War, some Jewish emigrants fleeing religious persecution in Germany settled here. They made important contributions to commerce in the lean years following the war. Becoming successful merchants, they provided credit when the banks failed and built impressive Victorian homes, such as the Wolf-Schlessinger House. It is now operated as the St. Francisville Inn Bed and Breakfast. 

===2000 to present===
In recent years, community efforts have focused on restoration and preservation of the town&#x27;s historic homes. St. Francisville is a popular tourist destination, with a number of restored historic plantations open for tours, including Rosedown Plantation State Historic Site, Audubon State Historic Site, Butler Greenwood Plantation, the Myrtles, and the Cottage Plantation, as well as several antebellum gardens.

In June 2011, the John James Audubon Bridge was constructed as the new crossing of the Mississippi River. This was the successor to the ferry three miles up-river. It connected New Roads to St. Francisville via Louisiana highway 10. Louisiana 10 then connected to US-61, three miles south of St. Francisville. On the opposite side of the bridge, Louisiana 10 crosses into Pointe Coupee Parish and connects with Louisiana highway 1 to connect New Roads to St. Francisville.

In May 2011, low-lying parts of Saint Francisville flooded in the Mississippi River floods of that year.

<text>Winnfield is a small city in, and the parish seat of, Winn Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 5,749 at the 2000 census, and 4,840 in 2010. Three governors of the state of Louisiana were from Winnfield: Huey Long, Earl K. Long, and Oscar K. Allen.

==History==

When Winn Parish was officially formed by the state legislature in 1852, Winnfield was established as the parish seat. During the Civil War, the area around Winnfield was the site of some minor skirmishes. Confederate forces defeated a Union detachment near Salsbury Bridge sent to destroy the Drake&#x27;s Salt Works in the area.

Many Civil War bandits made the region their home. Among these were the West and Kimbrel clan. 

Three Louisiana governors were Winnfield natives and grew up here: Huey Long, Oscar K. Allen and Earl Long. Huey Long became governor, U.S. Senator. He was assassinated in 1935. Oscar K. Allen was elected governor in 1932. Earl Long, &quot;the Louisiana Longshot,&quot; served in a variety of state positions, said to be more than other Louisianan, including elective office. He was elected governor in 1939, 1948 and 1956. He was elected to Congress in 1960 but died before he could assume office.

Winnfield was a major producer of salt in the Civil War days; salt kettles used at Big Cedar and Drake&#x27;s Salt Works furnished salt for the Confederate army. One still exists today in front of the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame, turned into a fountain. The salt works was located on Saline Bayou. Later the Cary Salt Works started an 840-foot deep mine west of Winnfield. The mine was used by the federal government in Project Coyboy Plowshare Program, Cowboy Event. Between December 1959 and March 1960 a series of high explosives were set off inside the Carry Salt Works in an unused portion of the mine. The mine was later flooded by an underground river. The mine and all equipment inside were abandoned.

The rock quarry operated near or on top of the salt mine and produced limestone and gravel still operates today as Winn Rock.

<text>Auburn is a city in south-central Maine, within the United States. Settled in the foothills of the Western Lakes and Mountains region of the state, The city serves as the county seat of Androscoggin County. The population was 24,061 at the 2020 census. Auburn and its sister city Lewiston are known locally as the Twin Cities or Lewiston–Auburn (L–A).

==History==
The area was originally part of the Pejepscot Purchase, land bought in 1714 by an association of people from Boston and Portsmouth following the Treaty of Portsmouth, which brought peace between the Abenaki Indians and the settlers of present-day Maine. In 1736, however, the Massachusetts General Court granted a large section of the land to veterans of the 1690 Battle of Quebec. Conflicting claims led to prolonged litigation; consequently, settlement was delayed until after the French and Indian Wars.

Auburn was first settled in 1786 as part of Bakerstown, renamed Poland when it was incorporated by the Massachusetts General Court in 1795. It was then part of Minot, formed from parts of Poland and incorporated in 1802. Auburn would itself be formed from parts of Minot and incorporated on February 24, 1842. The name was apparently inspired by &quot;Auburn&quot;, a village (real or fictitious) featured in the 1770 poem &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; by Oliver Goldsmith. Originally part of Cumberland County, the town became county seat of Androscoggin County at its creation in 1854. By annexing land from towns around it, including part of Poland in 1852, Minot in 1873, and all of Danville (first called Pejepscot) in 1867, Auburn grew geographically into one of Maine&#x27;s largest municipalities. Incorporated as a city on February 22, 1869, Auburn in 1917 would be the first city in the state to adopt a council-manager form of government.

Farms supplied grain and produce, but with construction of the bridge across the river to Lewiston in 1823, and especially after arrival of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad from Portland in January 1848, the community developed into a mill town. Mills were built to operate by water power from falls on the Androscoggin River and Little Androscoggin River. In 1835, the factory system of shoe manufacture originated at Auburn. Other firms manufactured cotton and woolen textiles, carriages, iron goods, bricks and furniture. The population in 1860 was only about 4,000 but by 1890 it had tripled to 12,000 as a result of its shoe factories attracting many French Canadian immigrants, many of whom arrived by train from Quebec. Steady population growth continued until around 1960, plateauing at roughly 24,500.

In Auburn, shoe manufacturing became the dominant industry by the late 19th century. The City Seal, depicting a spindle with different types of shoes at each outside point, was designed when Auburn was positioning itself as the shoe manufacturing center of Maine in the mid-19th century. In 1917, one factory in Auburn was producing 75 percent of the world&#x27;s supply of white canvas shoes; however, after World War II the shoe industry began to decline, and between 1957 and 1961 the largest manufacturers closed their factories.

The area became noted in 1985 due to the plane crash that took the life of Samantha Smith.

In 2023, Joe Biden became the first sitting United States president to visit Auburn in 111 years, with the previous being William Howard Taft in 1912.

===Lewiston-Auburn Shoe Strike===
In 1937, one of the largest labor disputes in Maine history occurred in Lewiston and Auburn. The Lewiston-Auburn Shoe Strike lasted from March to June and at its peak involved 4,000 to 5,000 workers on strike. After workers attempted to march across the Androscoggin River from Lewiston to Auburn, Governor Lewis Barrows sent in the Maine Army National Guard. Some labor leaders, CIO Secretary Powers Hapgood, were imprisoned for months after a Maine Supreme Judicial Court judge issued an injunction seeking to end the strike.

<doc id="115856" wikidata="Q501170" url="?curid=115856" title="Lewiston, Maine">
<text>Lewiston (; ) is the second most populous city in the U.S. state of Maine, with the city&#x27;s population at 37,121 as of the 2020 United States Census. The city lies halfway between Augusta, the state&#x27;s capital, and Portland, the state&#x27;s most populous city. A part of Androscoggin County, it is one-half of the Lewiston–Auburn metropolitan statistical area, commonly referred to as &quot;L/A.&quot; or &quot;L-A.&quot; Lewiston exerts a significant impact upon the diversity, religious variety, commerce, education, and economic power of Maine. It is known for having an overall low cost of living, substantial access to medical care, and a low violent-crime rate. In recent years, the city of Lewiston has also seen a spike in economic and social growth. While the dominant language spoken in the city is English, it is home to a significant Somali population as well as the largest French-speaking population in the United States (by population) while it is second to St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, in percentage of speakers.

The Lewiston area traces its roots to 1669 with the early presence of the Androscoggin tribe (the namesake of the county in which the city resides). In the late 18th century, in 1795, Lewiston was incorporated as Lewistown. The presence of the Androscoggin River and Lewistown Falls made the town an attractive area for manufacturing and hydro-power businesses. The rise of Boston rail and textile tycoon Benjamin Bates saw rapid economic growth rivaling that of Cambridge, Worcester, and Concord. Irish immigrants were recruited to build the railroad links and dig the canals for the textile mills. The Irish stayed, and worked the mills and established flourishing businesses, as evidenced by the McGillicuddy, Callahan, and other Blocks and the St. Joseph&#x27;s and St. Patrick&#x27;s churches. In the 1850 U.S. Census, Lewiston was 23% Irish born. The increase in economic stimulus prompted thousands of Quebecers to migrate, causing a population boom; the populace rose from 1,801 in 1840 to 21,701 in 1890. In 1855, local preacher Oren Burbank Cheney founded the Maine State Seminary, the first coeducational university in New England and one of the first universities to admit black students before the Emancipation Proclamation. Lewistown quickly became associated with the liberal arts and was incorporated as &quot;Lewiston&quot; in 1864, a year before the college was chartered as Bates College.

The city is home to the only basilica in Maine, Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul; 5 colleges and universities; 44 listings on the National Register of Historic Places; the Androscoggin Bank Colisée; the Stephens Observatory; the Olin Arts Center; the Bates College Museum of Art (BCMoA); and two significant general hospitals: Central Maine Medical Center and Saint Mary&#x27;s Regional Medical Center.

==History==
===Conception===
Prior to European colonization, the region of Lewiston was inhabited by the Androscoggin, an Abenaki people. During the 17th century, Androscoggin were among the first Native American tribes to make contact with European colonists in Maine. Relations soon deteriorated over colonial expansion, and conflicts with colonists and epidemics of infectious diseases devastated the Androscoggin, which responded by migrating to New France from 1669 onwards. By 1680, the Androscoggin had been completely driven out of Maine. The governor of New France, Louis de Buade, allocated them two &quot;seigneuries&quot; on the Saint Francis River.

===Colonial beginnings===
A grant comprising the area of Lewiston was given to Moses Little and Jonathan Bagley, members of the Pejepscot Proprietors, on January 28, 1768, on the condition that fifty families live in the area before June 1, 1774. Bagley and Little named the new town Lewistown. Paul Hildreth was the first man to settle in Lewiston in the fall of 1770. By 1795, Lewiston was officially incorporated as a town. At least four houses that have survived from this period are currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

King Avenue and Ralph Avenue were named after Ralph Luthor King, who owned the land near the fairgrounds. Elliott Avenue was named after his wife, Grace O. Elliott, whose son eventually built the family home at 40 Wellman Street.

===Industrial development and Benjamin Bates===
Lewiston was a slow but steadily growing farm town throughout its early history. By the early-to-mid-19th century, however, as water power was being honed, Lewiston&#x27;s location on the Androscoggin River would prove to make it a perfect location for emerging industry. In 1809, Michael Little built a large wooden sawmill next to the falls. Burned in 1814 by an arsonist, it was later rebuilt. In 1836, local entrepreneurs—predominantly the Little family and friends—formed the Androscoggin Falls Dam, Lock &amp; Canal Company:...for the purpose of erecting and constructing dams, locks, canals, mills, works, machines, and buildings on their own lands and also manufacturing cotton, wool, iron, steel, and paper in the towns of Lewiston, Minot, and Danville.

The sales of stock attracted Boston investors—including Thomas J. Hill, Lyman Nichols, George L. Ward and Alexander De Witt. De Witt convinced textile and rail tycoon Benjamin Bates, then-President of the Union Pacific Railroad, to come to Lewiston and fund the emerging Lewiston Water Power Company. Soon after Bates arrived, the company created the first canal in the city. In the spring of 1850, some 400 Irish men recruited in and around Boston by construction contractor Patrick O&#x27;Donnell arrived in Lewiston and began work on the canal system. Impressed with the labor force and &quot;working spirit&quot; of the Lewistonions, Bates founded the Bates Manufacturing Company, leading to the construction of 5 mills starting with Bates Mill No. 1. In August 1850, Maine Governor John Hubbard signed the incorporation act and the mill was completed 1852. Bates positioned the mill in Lewiston due to the location of the Lewiston Falls which provided the mill with power. Under Bates&#x27; supervision, during the Civil War, the mill produced textiles for the Union Army. His mills generated employment for thousands of Irish, Canadians, and immigrants from Europe. The mill was Maine&#x27;s largest employer for three decades.

This company began Lewiston&#x27;s transformation from a small farming town into a textile manufacturing center on the model of Lowell, Massachusetts. The creation of the Bates manufacturing trusts saw rapid economic growth, positioning the city as the wealthiest city in Maine, and created budding affluent districts such as the Main Street–Frye Street Historic District. Although the odd-majority of the population was working class, a distinctive upper class emerged at this time. The Bates Mill remained the largest employer in Lewiston from the 1850s to the mid-late 20th century.

Railroad construction was key to the development of both Lewiston and its neighbor, Auburn. In 1849, the Androscoggin &amp; Kennebec railroad, running through Lewiston and Auburn, connected these towns to Waterville and the St. Lawrence &amp; Atlantic Railway line between Portland, Maine, and Montreal, Quebec. The Androscoggin &amp; Kennebec Railroad was constructed by Irish laborers, many of whom joined the Lewiston canal construction crews in 1850. The Irish laborers and their families lived in shanty-town neighborhoods called &quot;patches&quot;. By 1854, one quarter of Lewiston&#x27;s population was Irish, the highest concentration in any settlement in Maine. Subsequently, trains connected Quebec with Lewiston on a daily schedule. During the Civil War, the high demand for textiles helped Lewiston develop a strong industrial base through the Bates Enterprise. However, the concentration of wealth in Benjamin Bates sparked the 1861 Lewiston cotton riots which prompted him to give thousands of dollars back to the city and expand the employment opportunities at his mills. In 1861, a flood of French-Canadian immigration into Maine began, spawned by industrial work opportunities in Maine cities with water power from waterfalls. This brought a significant influx of Québécois millworkers who worked alongside Irish immigrants and Yankee mill girls. Lewiston&#x27;s population boomed between 1840 and 1890 from 1,801 to 21,701. Canadiens settled in an area downtown that became known as Little Canada, and Lewiston&#x27;s character has remained largely Franco-American ever since. In 1855, a Maine preacher traveled from Parsonsfield to Lewiston to establish an institution of higher learning in the city. In 1855, the Maine State Legislature was petitioned by Lewiston locals to found the Maine State Seminary. The school opened in 1855, and educated the working class of Maine while also providing education for blacks and women at a time when other universities barred their entrance. At its founding, it became the first coeducational college in New England and one of the earliest proponents of abolitionism.

During this time, in 1863, Lewiston was incorporated as a city. In 1872, St. Peter&#x27;s church was built in Lewiston. This was the first French-Canadian national church in Maine. In 1864, the Maine State Seminary was renamed Bates College in honor of Benjamin Bates.

In 1880, &quot;Le Messager&quot;, a French-language newspaper, began printing in Lewiston to serve its predominant ethnic population. The local Kora Shrine was organized in 1891 and held its first meetings in a Masonic temple on Lisbon Street. This group would from 1908 to 1910 build the Kora Temple on Sabattus Street, the largest home of a fraternal organization in the state. Architect George M. Coombs designed this Moorish-style structure.

City leaders decided to build a cathedral to which the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland could relocate. Construction of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul began in 1905 and ended in 1938, funded mostly through thousands of small donations from Lewiston residents. It is the largest Roman Catholic Church in Maine, and Lewiston&#x27;s most prominent landmark. While the Diocese of Portland did not relocate to Lewiston, the church nevertheless became a basilica in 2004. It is one of the few American basilicas outside of a major metropolitan area.
===Lewiston-Auburn shoe strike===
In 1937, one of the largest labor disputes in Maine history occurred in Lewiston and Auburn. The Lewiston-Auburn Shoe Strike lasted from March to June and at its peak involved 4,000 to 5,000 workers on strike. After workers attempted to march across the Androscoggin River from Lewiston to Auburn, Governor Lewis Barrows sent in the Maine Army National Guard. Some labor leaders, among them CIO Secretary Powers Hapgood, were imprisoned for months after a Maine Supreme Judicial Court judge issued an injunction seeking to end the strike.

===Textile investment===

After World War I, profits from the textile industry in New England mill towns such as Lewiston; Biddeford; Manchester, New Hampshire; Waterbury, Connecticut; and Fall River, Haverhill, Lawrence and Lowell, Massachusetts began to decline. Businesses began moving to the South due to lower costs of power from more modern technologies (Lewiston&#x27;s water wheel technology gave way to hydroelectricity, cheaper transportation—as most cotton and materials came from the South—and cheaper labor).

Starting in the late 1950s, many of Lewiston&#x27;s textile mills began closing. This gradually led to a run-down and abandoned downtown area. Chain stores located downtown—Woolworth&#x27;s, W. T. Grant, S. S. Kresge, JC Penney and Sears Roebuck—shut their doors or moved to malls on the outskirts of Lewiston or Auburn. The city&#x27;s flagship department store, the four-story B. Peck &amp; Co., closed in 1982 after more than a century in business. As businesses and jobs began to leave the city, people followed. The population stopped increasing at its previous rate and began to slowly decline after 1970, then at a greater rate in the 1990s.

===Economic diversification and renaissance===
After a difficult economic period in the 1980s that saw high unemployment and downtown stagnation, several key events have led to economic and cultural growth, including the transformation of the historic Bates Mill Complex. Because the city took over the complex in 1992 after back taxes went unpaid, years of taxpayer frustration in the city&#x27;s need to maintain the behemoth led to two referendums (one non-binding vote, the other binding). Voters soundly supported the need to pursue redevelopment by maintaining the property and selling it to private developers. In 2001, the city sold three mill buildings to local developers. In 2003, Platz Associates sold the Bates Mill Complex, with the exception of Mill 5 and a small support building. For the next four years, a number of business enterprises expanded after Platz redeveloped the mill building. The Bates Mill complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 2010.

In May 2004, the city officials announced a plan for urban renewal near the downtown area. The plan was to demolish several blocks of 19th-century millworker housing, lay new streets with updated infrastructure, construct more owner-occupied, lower-density housing, and build a boulevard through one neighborhood using federal Community Development Block Grant funds provided over a period of ten years. Some residents of the affected neighborhoods felt that the plan was initially announced with little input from them. They formed a neighborhood group called &quot;The Visible Community&quot;, which has since been actively involved in the planning process, and resulted in cooperation between neighbors and city officials to redesign Kennedy Park, including input on the location of new basketball courts, and feedback regarding creation of the largest all-concrete skate park in Maine.

Downtown is home to a new headquarters for Oxford Networks, along with a $20-million upgrade in local fiber-optics, a new auto parts store, a campus of the for-profit Kaplan University, the headquarters for Northeast Bank, a parking garage, and the newly renovated Maine Supply Co. building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. That facility is now called the Business Service Center at Key Bank Plaza, and is home to the local Chamber of Commerce, the Lewiston-Auburn Economic Growth Council, and an arrangement with a number of business service providers.

The area&#x27;s renaissance has gained local, regional, and national recognition. In 2002 and again in 2006, the L-A area led the state in economic development activity, according to the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development&#x27;s list of business investments and expansions. In a 2006 KPMG International study measuring the cost of locating and maintaining a business, Lewiston ranked first among the New England communities analyzed, and finished 24th out of 49 U.S. communities analyzed.

Lewiston earned a 2007 All-America City Award designation by the National Civic League. The national competition &quot;recognizes communities whose residents work together to identify and tackle community-wide challenges and achieve measurable, uncommon results.&quot; 10 cities are selected as All-America Cities each year.

===Somali and Bantu migration===

In 1999, the United States government began preparations to resettle an estimated 12,000 refugees from Somalia to select cities throughout the United States. Most of the early arrivals in the United States settled in Clarkston, Georgia, a city adjacent to Atlanta. However, they were mostly assigned to low-rent, poverty-stricken inner-city areas, so many began to look to resettle elsewhere in the U.S.Word soon spread that Lewiston had free housing. In 1999, ethnic Somalis subsequently began a secondary migration from other states to the former mill town, and after 2005, many Somali Bantus, a separate ethnicity, followed suit.

In October 2002, then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond wrote an open letter addressed to leaders of the Somali community, predicting a negative impact on the city&#x27;s social services and requesting that they discourage further relocation to Lewiston. The letter angered many and prompted some community leaders and residents to speak out against the mayor, drawing national attention. Demonstrations were held in Lewiston, both by those who supported the immigrants&#x27; presence and those who opposed it.

In January 2003, about 32 members of a white nationalist group from Illinois demonstrated in Lewiston to denounce Somali immigrants. This prompted a simultaneous counter-demonstration on the campus of Bates College to demonstrate support of the Somali community. The rally repudiating the white nationalists attracted 4,000 attendees, including governor John Baldacci, Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins and other officials. Mayor Raymond was reportedly out of town on vacation on the day of the protests.

In August 2010, the &quot;Lewiston Sun Journal&quot; reported that Somali entrepreneurs had helped reinvigorate downtown Lewiston by opening shops in previously closed storefronts. Amicable relations were also reported by the local Franco-American merchants and the Somali storekeepers.

Somali farmers have had a positive impact on Lewiston agriculture life. Farming was known to be &quot;low caste&quot; to Somalis, before they were forced to labor during slavery. Since migrating to Maine farming has become a part of life to some Somalis.

Somali-American players contributed to the Lewiston High School boys soccer team&#x27;s state championship wins in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2023 under coach Mike McGraw.

===Spree shooting===

On October 25, 2023, a spree shooting occurred at two locations in Lewiston. Eighteen people were killed, and 13 others were injured. The first mass shooting occurred at a bowling alley during a youth league event, while the second occurred minutes later at a pool hall. After a two-day manhunt, the shooter, 40-year-old Robert R. Card, was found dead on October 27 from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound at a recycling facility in Lisbon after his vehicle was located nearby the night on the shooting. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the history of Maine.

The rematch was originally planned to be held in Boston, but was halted by Massachusetts boxing authorities due to licensing issues. Promoters were eventually able to frame a lucrative deal moving the fight to the Colisée in Lewiston. As the venue held less than 3,700 spectators, only 2,434 fans were present, setting an all-time record for the lowest attendance for a heavyweight championship match.

<text>Lisbon is a town in Androscoggin County, Maine, United States. The population was 9,711 at the 2020 census. It is included in both the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan statistical area and the Lewiston–Auburn, Maine Metropolitan New England city and town area. The town of Lisbon includes the villages of Lisbon and Lisbon Falls.

==History==
The community was originally part of Bowdoin, a township within the Kennebec Purchase. But because travel to attend town meetings was difficult, on June 22, 1799, the General Court of Massachusetts divided Bowdoin in two to create Thompsonborough. Residents, however, soon grew dissatisfied with the long name. Consequently, it would be renamed in 1802 as Lisbon, after Lisbon in Portugal. In 1808, Lisbon annexed the remainder of Little River Plantation (part of the Pejepscot Purchase) as Lisbon Falls. In 1840, part of Lisbon was set off as Webster.

With fertile and easily cultivated soil, farming was an early industry. Sawmills and gristmills were built using water power from the streams. Larger brick mills followed to manufacture textiles. In 1864, the Worumbo Mill was established to produce woolens, and would remain a principal employer until it burned in 1987.

===Spree shooting===

On October 25, 2023, a spree shooting occurred at two locations in Lewiston, Maine. Eighteen people were killed, and 13 others were injured. The first mass shooting occurred at a bowling alley during a youth league event, while the second occurred minutes later at a restaurant. After a two-day manhunt and shelter in place, the shooter, 40-year-old Robert R. Card, was found dead on October 27 from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound at a recycling facility in Lisbon after his vehicle was located nearby the night on the shooting. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the history of Maine.

Abenaki Indians called the falls &quot;Anmecangin&quot;, meaning &quot;much fish&quot;. The area was once part of Little River Plantation, a portion of which was incorporated in 1799 as Thompsonborough, then renamed in 1802 after Lisbon, Portugal. In 1806, Lisbon annexed the remainder of Little River Plantation. With water power from the Androscoggin River, Lisbon Falls became a small mill town. Before it burned down in 1987, the Worumbo Mill was the main mill in Lisbon Falls. It had been incorporated in 1864, and was world-famous for its woolens. Especially well known were its vicuña wool products, which became famous when President Eisenhower&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Sherman Adams, received a vicuna sport coat as a gift from a wealthy industrialist and had to resign due to the resulting scandal. The town&#x27;s primary employment was at a gypsum mill, which closed in 2009. Another large employer is Bath Iron Works, in nearby Bath, Maine.

The town is famous for its Moxie Days, a celebration of the soft drink Moxie, which is sold at Frank Anicetti&#x27;s corner store. The store&#x27;s official name is the Kennebec Fruit Company, but it is commonly referred to as The Moxie Store and is recognizable by its bright yellow paint job. Moxie Days in Lisbon Falls is attended by thousands from around the world each summer.

<text>Livermore is a town in Androscoggin County, Maine, United States, formerly in Oxford County, Maine. The population was 2,127 at the 2020 United States Census. It is included in both the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine Metropolitan New England City and Town Area. High schools students from Livermore attend Spruce Mountain High School in neighboring Livermore Falls. Livermore is known for The Norlands, the Washburn family home.

==History==

Livermore was incorporated in 1795, the northwestern-most town of Androscoggin County. In 1880, the population was 1,262. In 2010, the population was 2,095. Livermore had originally been a grant from the state of Massachusetts to certain people for services in an expedition, which was against Port Royal. The town was named for Deacon Elijah Livermore, a pioneer settler born in Waltham, Massachusetts. The first two settlers of Livermore are known to be Deacon Ellijah Livermore and Major Thomas Fish. Major Thomas Fish had originally been from Worcester County, Oxford, Massachusetts. Major Thomas Fish went to war in 1775, and he was a Major in the Continental Army. Major Thomas Fish had died on December 20, 1781, in Livermore, Maine. Deacon Ellijah Livermore had arrived in 1779, building the first mill near Long Pond in 1782.
In 1795 as Livermore familiarized, a county line was established based on the Androscoggin River. The Androscoggin River divides East Livermore and Leeds on the east and southeast. On the south of the river is Turner, on the west side is Canton and Hartford, and on the north side is Jay and Canton. From 1760 to 1805, Livermore had been in Cumberland and Lincoln Counties. In 1805, the town became part of Oxford County. By the act of East Livermore, Livermore was separated from Oxford County and became part of the Kennebec County. On March 1, 1844, the town of East Livermore had been incorporated in the Kennebec County, but by 1854, Livermore, along with Livermore Falls, had joined newly formed Androscoggin County. The county line had determined the east of the river as the Kennebec County, and the west part of the Oxford County. On March 31, 1854, the towns of Turner and Livermore officially set off from Oxford County to the Androscoggin County.

Early 19th Century in Livermore, Maine had mostly consisted of farmland which provided products such as dairy to numerous markets around the New England area. As the 19th Century progressed, Livermore had quickly advanced New England&#x27;s lifestyle through their farmland and involvement to the mills. As the industrial revolution developed, this small town in Maine had progressed important roles such as the paper mills, logging, and lumber. Livermore is well known for its long and round ponds, which are located in the northern part of town.

The first church in Livermore was established in 1793. Today, the town of Livermore now has Universalist, Methodist, Baptist and Free Baptist churches. Livermore, Maine today has seventeen schoolhouses, which are worth about $4,000. In 1880, the noted citizens of Livermore, Maine were Jonathan G. Hunton, General David Learned, the governor of Maine Reuel Washburn.

The small town of Livermore, Maine is still recognized and well known for the Washburn- Norlands Living History Center on 290 Norlands Rd, also known as the Israel Washburn Homestead. The Washburn- Norlands foundation supports the Washburn family and descendants. This foundation had converted the Washburn home into a historical museum to provide the community with remarkable stories of the 19th and 20th century and with the intent to preserve the land and buildings. The Norlands Living History center&#x27;s buildings such as the 1867 mansion, 1853 school house, 1828 meeting house, and 1883 library are all still in use today. The Washburn home still includes the families memories and documents such as historical clothing, photographs, furniture, books, family papers and artwork. The Norlands offers the community to experience life as it was in Maine in the 18th and 19th century. The Norlands is a family home of Israel Washburn, one of the many industrial and political rulers of the 19th Century. Opened in 1821, today the Norlands is a popular historical museum in which offers a variety of activities to experience the rural life of the Washburn family. The Norlands Living History Center buildings includes the famous Norlands mansion, a 19th-century schoolhouse, a library specifically for the Washburn family, a barn for farm animals, a meeting house and a farmers cottage. In April 2008, the farmers cottage and barn tragically burned down. In early 2011, the farmers cottage was rebuilt and reopened to the public. The barn has yet to be rebuilt as of July 2012.

<text>Minot is a town in Androscoggin County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,766 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of West Minot and Minot Center. It is part of both the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan statistical area and the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area.

==History==
Present-day Minot was part of Bakerstown Plantation, granted in 1765 by the Massachusetts General Court to Captain Thomas Baker and his company of soldiers for their services to the state at the 1690 Battle of Quebec. It replaced a 1736 grant at what is now Salisbury, New Hampshire, ruled invalid in 1741 because of a prior claim from the descendants of John Mason. In 1795, Bakerstown Plantation was incorporated as Poland, named after Chief Poland, a noted local Indian sachem. On February 18, 1802, the northeastern part of Poland was set off as Minot, named after George Richards Minot (1758–1802), historian and judge of the General Court who had aided in the town&#x27;s incorporation.

The first settler was Moses Emery from Newbury, Massachusetts, in 1772. At that time there were several Indians of the Anasagunticook tribe living in the immediate area. The surface of the town is uneven, in some parts hilly, but with good soil for agriculture, the principal early occupation. Mills were erected at various water power sites, and products included lumber, clapboards, shingles, boxes, shooks and barrel staves. There was also manufacturing in leather, particularly boots, shoes, saddles and harnesses. In 1842, land was set off to form Auburn, to which more land was ceded in 1873. Mechanic Falls, the industrial village astride the border with Poland, was set off in 1893. The population in 1859 was 1,734. Today, Minot is gradually transitioning into a bedroom community of the cities of Auburn and Lewiston.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Minot is drained by the Little Androscoggin River.

The town is crossed by state routes 11, 119 and 124. It is bordered by the towns of Oxford and Hebron to the northwest, Turner to the north, Auburn to the east, and Poland to the south, and Mechanic Falls to the southwest.

<text>Poland is a town in Androscoggin County, Maine, United States. The population was 5,906 at the 2020 census. Set among rolling hills and numerous lakes, the town is home to Range Ponds State Park, which includes hiking trails and a pristine freshwater beach. Poland is also a historic resort area. It is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan statistical area, which itself is part of the Greater Portland-Lewiston Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Land was granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1765 to officers and soldiers who served with Sir William Phips in the 1690 Battle of Quebec. It replaced a 1736 grant made to them called Bakerstown (now Salisbury, New Hampshire) which was ruled invalid in 1741 at the separation of New Hampshire from Massachusetts. The new plantation was also called Bakerstown (after Captain Thomas Baker), and included present-day Poland, Minot, Mechanic Falls and the greater part of Auburn.

Settled in 1767 by Nathaniel Bailey and Daniel Lane, Bakerstown Plantation would be incorporated as Poland on February 17, 1795. Poland is named after an &quot;ancient melody&quot; of the same name.

At the beginning, Poland was an agricultural town, with of the best land farmed by the Shakers who settled at Poland Hill, north of the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village in New Gloucester. Called the North Family of Shakers, the village was founded by members who moved from Gorham in 1819. The village lasted until 1887.

Industry was attracted to Poland&#x27;s water power sites. In 1859, when the population was 2,660, it had four sawmills, a gristmill, a tannery and a carriage factory. The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad passed through the northeastern corner of the town, spurring development and bringing tourists drawn to its scenic ponds and gentle hills. By 1893, when Mechanic Falls was set off as a separate town, Poland had evolved into a Gilded Age resort town.

In 1797, The Wentworth Ricker Inn in South Poland opened at the homestead Jabez Ricker, acquired from a 1794 land swap with the Alfred Shaker Village in Alfred. But when the railroad replaced stage travel, patronage declined and the inn closed. Then a grandson, Hiram Ricker, began proclaiming that the mineral spring on his family&#x27;s property had cured his dyspepsia. People began arriving to sample the spring&#x27;s curative waters, which flow 8 gallons a minute. Reopened in 1861, the inn was enlarged and renamed The Mansion House. But even that property could not handle the crowds of tourists, so in 1875 the family expanded the property, build an extravagant house that was dubbed &quot;Ricker&#x27;s folly&quot; due to skepticism that such a large property would be successful.

On July 4, 1876, the Poland Spring House opened atop Ricker&#x27;s Hill, an elevation of 800 feet (244 m) above sea level with magnificent views to the White Mountains. The hotel would be augmented over the years by architects John Calvin Stevens, Albert Winslow Cobb and Harry Wilkerson. It became a self-contained and exclusive spa, with guards at gatehouses instructed to turn away sightseers. With luxurious accommodations for 450 guests, the hotel attracted the rich and famous. Patrons included Gen. Benjamin Butler, Sen. James G. Blaine, Joan Crawford, Jimmy Durante, Jack Paar and Robert Goulet. But following World War II, the era of grand hotels waned. When the Rickers sold the Poland Spring House, its new owners allowed the sprawling facilities to deteriorate. Apollo Industries purchased the hotel in 1963 and converted it to the largest Women&#x27;s Job Corps facility in the United States. The Job Corps dormitory was vacated in 1969, and was destroyed by a spectacular fire on July 3, 1975.

Today, the water is bottled and sold as Poland Spring water by BlueTriton Brands.

===1978 P-3 Orion crash===
Poland was the site of one of the last major accidents involving aircraft from Maine&#x27;s Cold War air bases. A United States Navy patrol bomber from Naval Air Station Brunswick Patrol Squadron 8 (VP-8) disintegrated over Poland on September 22, 1978. An over-pressurized fuel tank caused the port wing of the Lockheed P-3 Orion to separate at the outboard engine. The detached wing sheared off part of the tail; and aerodynamic forces caused the remaining engines and starboard wing to detach from the fuselage. Debris rained down over a wide area near the Tripp Corner intersection on Route 11 shortly after noon. No homes were hit, but an explosive fuel-air fire following impact broke some windows. There were no survivors from the plane&#x27;s eight-man crew.

==Geography==

<text>Turner is a town in Androscoggin County, Maine, United States. The population was 5,817 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Turner, Turner Center and North Turner. The town is part of the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine Metropolitan New England City and Town Area.

==History==

First called Sylvester-Canada, the township was granted by the Massachusetts General Court on June 20, 1768, to Major James Warren and others, survivors of Captain Joseph Sylvester&#x27;s company for their services in the 1690 Battle of Quebec. It replaced a 1735 grant of the same name located at what is now Richmond, New Hampshire, but which was ruled invalid in 1741 because of prior claims from the heirs of John Mason. Reverend Charles Turner of Scituate, Massachusetts, acted as an agent for the dispossessed grantees, and would become the first minister of their new town.

It was settled in 1772 by Daniel Staples, Thomas Record, Elisha Record, Joseph Leavitt and Abner Phillips. Many of the first settlers came from Pembroke, Massachusetts, where most of the proprietors of Sylvester-Canada resided. Nearly all the early settlers came from towns which had sprung up around Plymouth, Massachusetts, including the Leavitt family, descendants of Deacon John Leavitt of Old Ship Church in Hingham, Massachusetts, and the Bradford family, descendants of Governor William Bradford of the Plymouth Colony. Following the Revolutionary War, settlement began to pick up, and by 1784 the expanding village had 30 families. Incorporated on July 7, 1786, Sylvester-Canada was renamed for Reverend Turner.

It was primarily a farming town producing corn and apples, but with exceptional water power sites on the Nezinscot River. Here, Samuel Blake built in 1775 the first mill, both a sawmill and gristmill, although it was destroyed by the great freshet of 1785. It was rebuilt the next season. There were 5 sawmills and 3 gristmills in the community when a fire destroyed those at Turner Village in 1856. They were replaced, and by 1886, industries included not only sawmills and gristmills but a box factory, carriage factory, shoe factory, tannery, paper pulp mill, cheese factory, fulling mill and pottery factory.

<text>Amity is a town in Aroostook County, eastern Maine, United States, near the Canada–United States border. The population was 253 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Amity was first settled in 1826, and incorporated as a town on March 19, 1836, from township T10 R1 WELS. According to some, the town was named for the 1794 Treaty of “Amity, Commerce, and Navigation between England and the United States,” which aimed to end the boundary dispute between Maine and New Brunswick.

In 1839, after the so-called &quot;Aroostook War&quot; ended with the signing of the Webster–Ashburton Treaty and gave Maine the town, whose ownership had been disputed, surveyors placed a monument in Monument Brook on the Canada–United States border. It served the dual purpose of commemorating the ending of the Aroostook War, and marking Monument Brook, the northernmost source of the Chiputneticook Lakes. The monument still stands today, but lies in a swamp. No roads lead to it and it is accessible only when on foot. An earlier monument, also to mark the northernmost source of the lakes, had consisted of a wooden post with the location engraved on it.

Amity has one building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Reed School in North Amity. It has stood for many years, and formerly served not only as a school but as the center of the community, and hosted a singing school, debates, and plays.

==Geography==

<text>Caribou is the second largest city in Aroostook County, Maine, United States. Its population was 7,396 at the 2020 census. The city is a service center for the agricultural and tourism industries, and the location of a National Weather Service Forecast Office.

==History==

Lumbermen and trappers first set up camps in the area in the 1810s. The first settlers came to what is now Caribou in the 1820s. Between 1838 and 1840, the undeclared Aroostook War flared between the United States and Canada, and the Battle of Caribou occurred in December 1838. The dispute over the international boundary delayed settlement of the area until after the signing of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty in 1842. With peace restored, European settlers arrived in gradually-increasing numbers beginning in 1843. From Eaton Plantation and part of half-township H, Caribou was incorporated in 1859 as the town of Lyndon on April 5. In 1869, it annexed Eaton, Sheridan and Forestville plantations. On February 26 of that year its name was changed to Caribou, only to revert to Lyndon on March 9. On February 8, 1877, Caribou was finally confirmed as the town&#x27;s permanent name. Two enduring mysteries are the reason for the original name of Lyndon, and the reasons for the town&#x27;s name being subsequently changed back and forth between Lyndon and Caribou. Caribou was the &quot;jumping off&quot; point for a large influx of settlers who immigrated directly from Sweden in 1870–1871, and settled the nearby &quot;Swedish colony.&quot; The small town grew throughout the late 19th century, and with the coming of the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad in the 1890s, agricultural exports exploded. This began a boom period which lasted well into the 1960s. Caribou became the largest potato shipping hub in the world, and had many related industries.

Nearby to the northeast, Loring Air Force Base opened in the early 1950s near Limestone, with bomber and tanker aircraft of the Strategic Air Command. It provided a major economic boost to the area, with construction starting in 1947 on &quot;Limestone Army Air Field.&quot; Caribou was incorporated as a city in 1967 on February 23, but the area&#x27;s boom period leveled off in the 1970s as a result of difficulties in its traditional potato industry. That, along with closure of the base in 1994, contributed to a decline in population in the 1980s and 1990s.

In September 1984, Caribou was the lift-off location of the first successful solo balloon crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by Colonel Joseph Kittinger. This flight is memorialized at the Rosie O&#x27;Grady Balloon of Peace Park one mile (1.6 km) south of the city on Main Street. This site includes a large replica of Kittinger&#x27;s balloon.

The Caribou Public Library is a Carnegie library. Designed in the Romanesque Revival style by local architect Schuyler C. Page, it was built in 1911–1912 with a $10,000 grant.

==Geography==

Caribou is located in the geographical center of Aroostook County, at an elevation of above sea level. The county is readily accessible by two major highways; Interstate 95 from the south and the Trans-Canada Highway (New Brunswick Route 2) from the north and east. In sparsely populated Aroostook County, Caribou is at the hub of spokes serving the area via U.S. 1 and Maine State routes 89, 161, 164, 205 and 228. In 2013, a bypass was completed just outside the urban limits.

Caribou has a municipal airport, with full east–west and north–south runways. It is primarily used for corporate, hobby, and Civil Air Patrol usage. Presque Isle International Airport in Presque Isle serves as the primary hub for air service. Daily flights are scheduled to and from northern Maine on jetBlue with connections to Boston Logan International Airport.

Seaports are also close by in coastal Maine, New Brunswick, and Quebec. The closest deep-water port is Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec, north of Caribou, on the St. Lawrence River.

The Eastern Maine Railroad serves Caribou and Aroostook County, also connecting Maine, Vermont and the Canadian provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick and providing a direct rail link between northern Maine; Saint John, New Brunswick; and Montreal, Quebec. Given the city&#x27;s economic and cultural ties with the Canadian provinces of Quebec and New Brunswick, cross-border partnerships and relationships are often a common facet in many businesses.
