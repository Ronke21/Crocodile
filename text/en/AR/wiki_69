<doc id="124137" wikidata="Q644598" url="?curid=124137" title="Osceola, Nebraska">
<text>Osceola is a city and the county seat of Polk County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 880 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
According to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the first settlers of Osceola, which included the families of Reverend James Query and Vinson Perry Davis, arrived in October 1868. Davis is credited with naming the settlement after a city of the same name in Iowa, which had been named after Chief Osceola of the Seminole people. After three years of settlement and disputes over the permanent location, the town itself was organized by frontiersmen William Francis Kimmel and John Hopwood Mickey in the early fall of 1871. It had been decided in an election by a margin of 14 votes, prior to the formation that the &quot;geographic center of the county&quot; was best suited to be the settlement&#x27;s site. A courthouse was erected the following spring and a general store was founded in May. During the summer, a post office was built, which served as a terminus between the cities of Lincoln and Ulysses. The town&#x27;s first full year concluded with the establishment of a public school. The following year brought Methodism to the town, and a church for the faith had been completed by 1878. In the succeeding year, Nebraska Wesleyan college was founded in the church, serving 11 students by means of 4 instructors. The school would later move to Fullerton. The Omaha and Republican Valley Railroad, reached the town in 1879 and named a locomotive after the city, however it was ultimately renamed the number &quot;9.&quot; Two years following the arrival of the railroad, the settlement was incorporated as a village on August 26, 1881 after accumulating a population of 200 citizens. The city would ultimately reach its peak of 1,200 residents in 1920.

A newspaper titled &quot;The Homesteader&quot; was established in August 1873. It was renamed the &quot;Osceola Record&quot; in March 1876, and as of 1995 it is known as the &quot;Polk County News&quot;. It currently has a circulation of approximately 1,850 subscribers.

The city experienced a drought from 1893–95. During the final stages in 1895, much of the city was burned by a two-hour-long fire that left only two buildings standing.

A sewage plant for the city was constructed in 1958 and expanded in 2007. Hanna Keelan from Lincoln, Nebraska was responsible for the formation of a comprehensive city plan formulated in 1985.

In the city&#x27;s centennial year of 1971, celebrations were held for the city and twenty years after this, festivities marked the 100th anniversary of St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church just outside town.

<text>Shelby is a village in Polk County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 714 at the 2010 census. Shelby lies along the north side of U.S. Highway 81 near the eastern edge of Polk County. It is east of Osceola, and just south and west of Columbus. Nebraska&#x27;s center of population is near Shelby.

==History==
In 1873, Civil War veteran Horace A. Cowles set up the Cyclone post office in his home one mile east and one mile south of present-day Shelby. In 1879, with the coming of the railroad, a second post office named Arcade was established one mile east of the present site of Shelby. In the winter of 1880, the post office was moved again a mile west to where Shelby is today. Postal authorities objected to the name &quot;Arcade&quot; due to confusion with the town of Arcadia in Valley County. In search of a new name for the settlement, the people chose &quot;Shelby&quot;, after the name of an official with the Omaha and Republican Valley Railway (a branch of the Union Pacific). The land which Arcade was established on was owned by Gilbert Van Vorce and Peter Matter. Seeing a need for a trade center in the area, these men gave the railroad company half interest in their property and the town was established. After the railroad retained its on each side and closest to the tracks, eight blocks were located on each side parallel to the tracks. The original streets are still present and retain the names of Walnut, Elm, Chestnut, Pine, Cherry, and Oak.
In 1880 the town of Shelby boasted a population of 93 with businesses which included a drug store, hardware store, hotel, boot and shoe shop, livery stable, and physician. J.T. Dunning built the first elevator, located on the south side of the tracks along with the railway depot. The first store, owned by H.C. and Frank Dunning, sold general merchandise. Conrad Thelen and Charles Krumbach opened the first hardware store, which would run for 40 years.

Today Shelby has 690 residents, businesses, programs, community organizations, and a new housing development subdivision. Shelby celebrated its centennial in 1979 and its quasquicentennial in 2004.

Taddiken sold the rights, privileges and radio broadcasting equipment to Dr. George R. Miller of York, Nebraska, for the purpose of consolidating with KGBZ, in 1931.

Shelby is served by the &quot;Polk County News&quot;, based in Stromsburg.

<text>Matchstick puzzles are rearrangement puzzles in which a number of matchsticks are arranged into shapes or numbers, and the problem to solve is usually formulated as moving a fixed number of matchsticks to achieve some specific other arrangement.

The puzzles may ask the solver to alter some mathematical equation, often with numbers represented as Roman numerals, or Arabic numerals in a seven-segment display typeface. Other puzzles challenge the solver to rearrange a crude matchstick picture.

Some matchstick puzzles require lateral thinking, such as changing a number into a mathematical symbol.

Puzzles may also be set with no starting position, simply challenging the solver to create an arrangement using a number of matches. One example that requires lateral thinking is to form four equilateral triangles from six matches; this can only be done by arranging the matches in a three-dimensional pyramid shape.

<text>Stromsburg is a city in Polk County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 1,028 as per the 2020 census.

==History==
Stromsburg was settled early in Nebraska history. A group of Swedish settlers from the town of Ockelbo arrived in the 1860s after several years in Illinois. This group was led by Lewis Headstrom, who was a real estate agent. Seeing some similarities to their old Swedish homeland the settlers formed what would be called Stromsburg, named after a section of Ockelbo, Sweden. By the 1880s, two brickyards were in operation in the town. Many buildings constructed of ‘native’ brick still stand, including the Viking Center, now a community center that was originally The Opera House; the Cornerstone Bank; two businesses on the east side of the square; and several homes. Brick streets still surround the city square in Stromsburg. A brick Carnegie library was built in Stromsburg in 1918. The downtown area of Stromsburg has a town square in its center. This square forms a park, with lawns and mature trees, where festivals and events are held. In the center of the square is a two-story Swedish style building made of brick with decorative toll painting and the phrase &quot;Välkommen&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Welcome&quot;).

Stromsburg was given the title of the “Swede Capital of Nebraska” by Governor Frank B. Morrison in 1966 at the Swedish Festival. The Swedish festival is held in June each year and showcases Stromburg&#x27;s Swedish heritage.

Stromsburg Public School was established in 1887. It operated until 2002, when the Stromsburg district consolidated with Benedict, Nebraska to form Cross County Community School.

Craft shows and live Viking demonstrations are staged.

<doc id="124142" wikidata="Q1756347" url="?curid=124142" title="British National Formulary">
<text>The British National Formulary (BNF) is a United Kingdom (UK) pharmaceutical reference book that contains a wide spectrum of information and advice on prescribing and pharmacology, along with specific facts and details about many medicines available on the UK National Health Service (NHS). Information within the BNF includes indication(s), contraindications, side effects, doses, legal classification, names and prices of available proprietary and generic formulations, and any other notable points. Though it is a national formulary, it nevertheless also includes entries for some medicines which are not available under the NHS, and must be prescribed and/or purchased privately. A symbol clearly denotes such drugs in their entry.

It is used by pharmacists and doctors (both general practitioners (GPs) and generalist hospital practitioners, and by other prescribing healthcare professionals (such as nurses, pharmacy technicians, paramedics, and dentists)); as a reference for correct dosage, indication, interactions and side effects of drugs. It is also used as a reassurance by those administering drugs, for example a nurse on a hospital ward, and even for patients and others seeking an authoritative source of advice on any aspect of pharmacotherapy.

==Development==
Many individuals and organisations contribute towards the preparation of the BNF. It is authored by Pharmaceutical Press, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society&#x27;s (RPS) knowledge business; and is jointly published by the BMJ (owned by the BMA), and Pharmaceutical Press (owned by the RPS). It is published under the authority of a Joint Formulary Committee (JFC), which comprises pharmacy, medical, nursing, and lay representatives; there are also representatives from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK Health Departments, and a national guideline producer. 

Information on drugs is drawn from the manufacturers&#x27; product literature, medical and pharmaceutical literature, regulatory authorities and professional bodies. Advice is constructed from clinical literature, and reflects, as far as possible, an evaluation of the evidence from diverse sources. The BNF also takes account of authoritative national guidelines and emerging safety concerns. In addition, the Joint Formulary Committee takes advice on all therapeutic areas from advisers from expert groups; this ensures that the BNF&#x27;s recommendations are relevant to practice. In September 2016, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK gave NICE accreditation to the processes to produce BNF publications; a further review in 2021 resulted in the successful renewal of accreditation.

==History==
It was first published in 1949, as the National Formulary, with updated versions appearing every three years until 1976. The fifth version in 1957 saw its name change to &quot;The British National Formulary&quot;. A new-look version, under the auspices of Owen Wade, was released in 1981. A study in Northern Ireland, looking at prescribing in 1965, reported that the BNF was likely able to serve the requirements of prescribers in general practice, while also achieving a cost saving. By 2003, issue 46 of the BNF contained 3000 interactions or groups of interactions, with about 900 of these marked by a bullet.

==Editions==
A new edition of the BNF book is published twice-yearly, in March and September. The current edition is 87, which was published in March 2024. It is a tradition that the colour of each new edition is radically different from the previous.

==Availability==
BNF content is available digitally via a website and mobile app, and as a book. The book is available for purchase. In 2023, NICE announced their decision to stop the supply of print BNF to NHS organisations in England. The same decision was made by Scotland and Wales. NHS workers and healthcare professionals in the HINARI group of developing nations are entitled to free access via MedicinesComplete following registration (requires provision of a name, an address, an email address, and a phone number). Other visitors can subscribe to the BNF on MedicinesComplete. Healthcare organisations can also subscribe to a customisable BNF via their corporate online intranet. In 2017, BNF Publications released applications for offline access to the BNF on iOS and Android devices. Monthly content updates are available, over an internet connection. NICE provides a website providing the content of the BNF for non-commercial to the public, including non-NHS users.

The BNF also includes the Nurse Prescribers&#x27; Formulary (NPF) and other NPF content for use by District Nurses and Specialist Community Public Health Nurses (including Health Visitors), who have received training to become nurse prescribers.

==Sister publications==
The &quot;British National Formulary for Children&quot; (BNFC) book, first published September 2005, is published yearly, and details the doses and uses of medicines in children from neonates to adolescents.

==BNF sections==
The &quot;British National Formulary&quot; is divided into various sections; with the main sections on drugs and preparations being organised by body system.

<text>Indianola is a village in Red Willow County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 584 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Indianola was platted in 1873. The community was named after Indianola, Iowa, the former hometown of an early settler. In its early days, Indianola was the county seat of Red Willow County. After the railroad opted to locate its midpoint terminal on the Omaha to Denver route in McCook rather than in Indianola, the seat was moved there and Indianola declined.

Located in the City Park of Indianola is the grave of a Pawnee woman who died of wounds received at the battle between the Sioux and Pawnee tribes at Massacre Canyon, just east of Trenton. The woman was originally buried northwest of town on a bluff overlooking Coon Creek. In the 1970s, it became obvious that erosion would eventually destroy her gravesite, and in 1975 she was reburied in the park, with representatives of the Pawnee tribe participating in the ceremony.

<text>Falls City is a city in and the county seat of Richardson County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 4,133 at the 2020 census, down from 4,325 in 2010 and 4,671 in 2000.

==History==
The site of Falls City is located on the north side of the Big Nemaha River, in the southeast corner of the state. The river in 1857 had banks and bed of rock and stone. The town was located near where the river flowed over a rock ledge called the &quot;Falls of Nemaha&quot;, for which the town was named. Over time the river has changed to the extent that the falls no longer exist.

Falls City was founded in the summer of 1857 by James Lane, John Burbank, J. E. Burbank, and Isaac L. Hamby. The men were all Abolitionists and the city was established as a station on the Underground Railroad for escaping slaves on a section referred to as the Lane Trail. The city was established during the struggles resulting from the Kansas–Nebraska Act (passed in 1854) and continuing through the American Civil War. Early in the city&#x27;s history, it won a prolonged process to become the county seat of Richardson County. The county originally selected Salem, Nebraska to be the county seat, but due to Salem&#x27;s lack of a suitable building site, a new election was held which Falls City tied in the vote. Finally in a third election in 1860, Falls City was declared the permanent site of the county seat.

Falls City grew in the late 19th century due to the arrival of the Atchison &amp; Nebraska Railroad in 1871 and the Missouri Pacific in 1882, for which Falls City was designated as a division point in 1909. The population of the city peaked at 6,200 citizens in 1950.

In the summer of 1966, Braniff Airlines Flight 250 crashed near Falls City due to bad weather, killing all 42 on board. The BAC One-Eleven aircraft was on the Kansas City to Omaha leg of a multi-stop flight from New Orleans to Minneapolis on Saturday night, August 6.

In 1993, Brandon Teena, a trans man who had recently arrived in Falls City, was murdered by two acquaintances who, upon discovering that he had been born female, had beaten and raped him about a week previously. Brandon had reported the rape to the police, but the Richardson County sheriff had failed to take steps to protect him; in particular, he had not arrested the two alleged rapists. Learning that the rape had been reported, the two tracked Brandon to a farmhouse near Humboldt, where they killed him and two others. Brandon&#x27;s mother subsequently sued the sheriff and the county for negligence, wrongful death, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Briefs were filed in the case by thirty-four civil-rights groups, including the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund; the matter eventually came before the Nebraska Supreme Court, which found the county negligent in failing to protect Brandon. The episode was dramatized in a 1999 film titled &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;; actor Hilary Swank received an Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Brandon.

<text>Preston is a village in Richardson County in Southeastern Nebraska, United States. It is located within the Sac and Fox Reservation. The population was 19 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Sac Post Office, established in 1874, was named for the Sac and Fox Indian tribes that live in this area. The offspring of mixed marriages (primarily progeny of early French trappers and adventurers) were given land on the Half-Breed Tract. Some of their descendants still live there, while others sold their land and moved on.

Preston was platted in 1878 when the Atchison &amp; Nebraska Railroad was extended to that point. In February 1880 Philip R. Shelly, the town&#x27;s founder, built a store and applied for a post office. However, the postal authorities rejected the proposed name of &quot;Blufton&quot;, since there was another one in Sherman County. James Eatough, who worked for Shelly, had come from Preston, England, so he suggested that name. On June 23, 1881, &quot;Preston&quot; was accepted by both post office and railroad. The town was then platted on a total of approximately 40 acres in 1881 by Shelly from a point running along the railroad tracks, where a siding was available, to the south. An elevator and a depot were built along the tracks for commerce and travelers. A. D. McAlpine, a telegraph operator from Canada, was the first railroad station agent.

Shelly was the first postmaster. He built one of the general stores and a drugstore, ran the saloon, and owned a livery stable. In addition, he bought and sold cattle and hogs, shipping them to markets in St. Joseph (MO), Kansas City (KS), and Chicago (IL). On Monday and Tuesday nights, the rail yards were busy as men loaded two or three carloads of livestock. The town had a bank, three general stores, two barber shops, two drug stores, two livery stables, two blacksmiths, and two hotels. One of the two harness shops employed six girls to make fly nets for horses.

Preston&#x27;s first one-room school served the community until 1889, when a larger schoolhouse was built. The grounds were fenced with four-foot woven wire to keep animals out. In the 1920s, several other districts consolidated with Preston and operated a three-year high school.

Preston&#x27;s peak came in 1890 with a population of 150. The people of Preston represented a wide variety of occupations and avocations. Each helped the town to grow through their business and patronage. It was a center for farmers to market their produce as well as to buy needed supplies. The two two-story hotels provided traveling men a place to stay overnight while selling their wares to the local merchants. The proprietor who ran the business at the Central Hotel couldn&#x27;t read or write, so he made an &quot;X&quot; whenever his written approval was needed.

Residents and visitors enjoyed a variety of entertainment. There was a dance floor above the bank, which also served as a community opera house. Programs ranged from skits and readings, to debates on pertinent topics. &quot;Medicine shows&quot; were also held here. The local school provided a place for public events such as political debates at Third and Russell Streets. Preston&#x27;s post office was on Iowa Street not far from the railroad depot and the German Evangelical Church was further south at Third and Iowa Streets. The Bethel Dunkard Society held services at the schoolhouse in German.

The infamous cyclone of May 17, 1896, nearly destroyed Preston (and severely damaged much of southeast Richardson County and northeast Kansas, including several fatalities). Almost every building in town was blown away, or needed repairs. Fires also took their toll including when the Shelly &amp; Rieger general store burned in 1891 and in 1903 when the harness shop caught fire and burned most of the block, including four or five businesses and the Lindell Hotel. Residents could take the train to Falls City for 17 cents and this mode of transportation, both in convenience and low cost, further added to Preston&#x27;s decline since people could travel more easily to &quot;the big city&quot; of Falls City.

After the cyclone and then the fires, the town started to &quot;dismantle.&quot; The Central Hotel and Farmers National Bank were torn down and moved to Falls City. When the automobile became popular, people drove to Falls City to get whatever was needed. Local stores could not compete, so one-by-one they all closed.

In 1928, Preston&#x27;s elementary school still operated, but the community held its last high school class that year.

Shelly&#x27;s General Store, then owned by Ryan (or Bryon) Shelly, operated as late as 1933 and in 1928 it was twice victimized by burglars during a rash of burglaries of small stores across the county.

By 1969 the only thing left was the post office, the elementary school, and a voting hall. The post office was made a rural branch in 1974 and the elementary school merged with Falls City. The depot closed in 1953, although coal trains continue to rumble along the north side of town on a regular schedule.

<text>Rulo is a village in Richardson County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 144 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Rulo was laid out in 1857. It was named for Charlie Rouleau, the original owner of the town site.

In 1933, the foundation for the Rulo Bridge, a toll bridge across the Missouri River, was laid. The owner of the bridge was originally John Mullen from Falls City, together with a group of investors, the &quot;Kansas City Bridge Company&quot;. Construction of the bridge began in 1938, after the Works Progress Administration decided to finance half the cost. The bridge was finished in 1939.

During the early 1980s, a small group of Christian Identity survivalists, led by Michael W. Ryan, began living in a religious cult located on a farm two miles north of Rulo, along the Missouri River. The farm was converted into a compound and the members of the cult would commit thefts throughout the Nebraska-Missouri-Kansas area. The stolen property would be sold in order to buy weapons and survival equipment for the group. Ryan was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death after the Nebraska State Patrol discovered that he was responsible for the torture murders of a 26-year-old cult member and a five-year-old boy. Ryan died of natural causes in prison in 2015.

In 2013, a new bridge carrying U.S. Highway 159 across the Missouri River was opened. The 1939 bridge, deemed too narrow for semi-trailers and farm machinery, was demolished in 2014.

<text>Stella is a village in Richardson County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 150 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The earliest settlers in the Stella area arrived in about 1855. An August 1881 public meeting of local farmers led to an arrangement for the Missouri Pacific Railroad to be extended to that point. Stella was platted the same year, and was named for Stella Clark, the daughter of the original owner of the town site. The track reached Stella in December 1881 and a station building was raised on January 7, 1882.

The village was incorporated in 1882 and grew quickly. By fall 1882 there were 25 business firms in town. A 56-page &quot;Souvenir&quot; of the Stella Press was issued on April 1, 1901, recounting the steady growth of the town to that point, which proved to be the peak of the town population. By that time there were five churches: the Baptist, Methodist, Christian, Lutheran, and Church of Christ Scientist. Residents had a choice of nine lodges and a number of social organizations. The school commenced in 1884, a water system was begun in 1887, an opera house was built in 1898, telephones were introduced in 1899, and an electrical system was in the planning stage in 1901. Detailed biographical sketches of more than 200 local families were included in the &quot;Souvenir.&quot;

<doc id="124161" wikidata="Q1036642" url="?curid=124161" title="International Stuttering Awareness Day">
<text>International Stuttering Awareness Day (ISAD), or International Stammering Awareness Day, is an annual celebration held on October 22. It was first held in the UK and Ireland, in 1998. The day is intended to raise public awareness of the issues faced by millions of people – one percent of the world&#x27;s population – who stutter, or stammer.

Every year, stuttering communities and associations around the world get together, put on events and campaign to highlight how certain aspects of society can be difficult for people who stammer; to challenge negative attitudes and discrimination; and to debunk myths that people who stammer are nervous or less intelligent. 

ISAD also celebrates the many notable figures who stammer who have made a mark on the world now and throughout history in the fields of science, politics, philosophy, art, cinema and music.

==Organization==
Different countries and organizations participate in ISAD in their own way. Some organizations that regularly have ISAD activities:

*ISAD Online Conference team
*European League of Stuttering Associations
*International Fluency Association
*International Stuttering Association
*National Stuttering Association (USA)

==Activities==

ISAD includes an online conference, running annually from October 1 to 22 each year, targeted at people with an interest in stuttering as well as speech-language pathologists and their clients. The conferences, held every year since 1998, are all still available online. More boys than girls stutter by a ratio of 8 to 1. However, girls are less successful in eliminating their stutter as they mature.

Worldwide there are public awareness events, a media campaign, educational activities and online resources.

In an article published in the UK magazine &quot;Community Care&quot; to mark International Stuttering Awareness Day, Irina Papencheva from the Bulgarian Stuttering Association and Phil Madden from the European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities demanded a fresh start in attitudes towards stammering, saying that &quot;everyone has the responsibility to be aware, to be sensitive in our conversations and meetings&quot; and to remember that stuttering is &quot;&quot;not&quot; funny&quot;.

A town every 9 miles on the railroad, as a steam engine required regular water stops. Crete was once a contender for county seat.

On February 18, 1969, Crete was the site of a railroad accident that released a fog of anhydrous ammonia fumes from a ruptured railroad tank car, killing five residents and seriously injuring 11 others in their homes.

==Economy==

A popular tool, called the Vise-Grip, was first manufactured in De Witt. The Vise-Grip was originally manufactured in De Witt by Petersen Manufacturing, founded by Danish immigrant William Petersen. Petersen, a blacksmith by trade, invented the first locking pliers and began selling them from the trunk of his car to farmers and people in surrounding towns. In 1985 American Tool Companies Inc. was formed by the Petersen family, and it in turn acquired Petersen Manufacturing. In 1993 American Tool acquired Irwin Industrial. The company operated under the Irwin Industrial name beginning in 2002 when it was purchased by Newell Rubbermaid. On October 31, 2008, the plant was closed and 330 jobs were lost when manufacturing of Vise-Grips and other tools moved to China. In 2018 the building was sold to Malco Products, and as of 2021 has resumed producing pliers of the same style under the name Eagle Grip. 

In 2009 Gerry Durnell writing in &quot;Automobile Quarterly&quot; said: &quot;The original Vise-Grip manufacturing plant now sits vacant. One auction has already taken place, another is contemplated, and the building is for sale.

==Education==
DeWitt is served by Tri County Public Schools, which was established in 1966 as a consolidation of various school districts.

<text>Friend is a city in Saline County, Nebraska, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 954.

==History==
The city is named for Charles E. Friend, who homesteaded the land and initially named the community Friendville. He operated a dry goods store and post office. In 1873 the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad named its new train station there &quot;Friend.&quot;

The National Greyhound Association was founded in the community in 1906 (called at the time National Coursing Association).

The Friend Police Department, which was initially housed in a tool shed during construction of U.S. Route 6, was reported by &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; to be the smallest police station in the world. In the 1960s, the shed doubled in size so the Nebraska State Patrol could also be stationed there to issue traffic citations and make arrests. Afterwards, Friend still claimed to have the smallest combined police station. It was demolished in 2015 and replaced with a neon Friend sign.

<text>Duke of Devonshire is a title in the Peerage of England held by members of the Cavendish family. This (now the senior) branch of the Cavendish family has been one of the wealthiest British aristocratic families since the 16th century and has been rivalled in political influence perhaps only by the Cecil marquesses of Salisbury and the Stanley earls of Derby.

==History==
Although the Cavendish family estates are centred in Derbyshire, they hold the titles of &quot;Duke of Devonshire&quot; and their subsidiary title of earldom of Devonshire (neither peerage is related to the ancient title of Earl of Devon). The first Earl may have chosen &quot;Devonshire&quot; simply because places and lands he was associated with were already attached to existing peerages at the College of Arms. The title remains associated with &quot;Devonshire&quot; even though in modern usage it is the county of Devon. Another reason for the choice of a non-local or regional name was to avoid antagonising the powerful Stanley family from the Midlands who had strong associations with Derbyshire since their ancestors had been gifted estates in the county by William the Conqueror, and they had also been the Earls of Derby since the late 15th century. (See British peerage ranks.)

Every Duke of Devonshire has so far been appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter, except () the present one.

===Cavendish knights, and the 1st Earl of Devonshire===
The Cavendish family descends from Sir John Cavendish, who took his name from the village of Cavendish, Suffolk, where he held an estate in the 14th century. He served as Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench from 1372 to 1381, and was killed in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in 1381. Two of his great-grandsons were George Cavendish, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey&#x27;s biographer, and George&#x27;s younger brother Sir William Cavendish. Sir William gained great wealth from his position in the Exchequer and also (allegedly) from unfairly taking advantage of the dissolution of the Monasteries. He married (1547) as his third wife the famous Bess of Hardwick, with whom he had eight children. One of their sons, Sir Charles Cavendish (1553–1617), was the father of William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1592–1676; see Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne for more information on this branch of the family), while another son, Henry Cavendish, was the ancestor of the Barons Waterpark. Yet another son, William Cavendish (1552–1626), was a politician and a supporter of the colonization of Virginia. In 1605 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cavendish, of Hardwicke in the County of Derby, and in 1618 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Devonshire. Both titles are in the Peerage of England.

===The 2nd Earl of Devonshire and the first five Dukes of Devonshire===
He was succeeded by his eldest son, William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire, who served as Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire and was a patron of the philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679). On his early death in 1628 the titles passed to his son, William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire, who also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He was a strong supporter of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and later served under William III and Mary II as Lord Steward of the Household. In 1694 he was created Marquess of Hartington and Duke of Devonshire in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Duke, who held political office as Lord President of the Council and Lord Privy Seal and was also Lord-Lieutenant of Devonshire. His eldest son, the third Duke, served as Lord Privy Seal, as Lord Steward of the Household and (from 1737 to 1745) as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.

On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Duke, who was a prominent politician. He was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Cavendish, of Hardwicke in 1751 and served as First Lord of the Treasury and titular Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1756 to 1757. Devonshire married Charlotte Boyle, 6th Baroness Clifford, daughter of the famous architect Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington (on whose death in 1753 the earldom of Burlington became extinct). Their third and youngest son Lord George Cavendish was recreated Earl of Burlington in 1831. Devonshire was succeeded by his eldest son, William Cavendish, who became the fifth Duke of Devonshire. He had already succeeded his mother as seventh Baron Clifford in 1754. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire from 1782 to 1811 but is best remembered for his first marriage (1774) to Lady Georgiana Spencer (1757–1806), the celebrated beauty and society hostess.

===The sixth, seventh and eighth Dukes===
Their only son, the sixth Duke, served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household from 1827 to 1828 and from 1830 to 1834. Known as the &quot;Bachelor Duke&quot;, he never married and on his death in 1858 the barony of Clifford fell into abeyance between his sisters. He was succeeded in the other titles by his first cousin once removed, the second Earl of Burlington, who became the seventh Duke (see the Earl of Burlington for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was the son of William Cavendish, eldest son of the aforementioned first Earl of Burlington, youngest son of the fourth Duke. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire and Derbyshire and Chancellor of the University of London and of the University of Cambridge. He was succeeded by his second, but eldest surviving son, the eighth Duke. The eighth Duke was a noted statesman and the most famous member of the Cavendish family. Known under his courtesy title of Marquess of Hartington until 1891, he held political office for a period spanning 40 years, notably as Secretary of State for India and as Secretary of State for War, and three times declined to become Prime Minister. He married Louise, Dowager Duchess of Manchester, who became known as the &quot;Double Duchess&quot;.

===The ninth, tenth and eleventh Dukes===

Devonshire died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Duke. He was the eldest son of Lord Edward Cavendish, third son of the seventh Duke. He was a Conservative politician and served as Governor General of Canada from 1916 to 1921 and as Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1922 to 1924.

His elder son, the tenth Duke, also a Conservative politician, served as Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, as Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma and as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. He married Lady Mary Gascoyne-Cecil, who was Mistress of the Robes to Queen Elizabeth II from 1953 to 1966. Their elder son and heir apparent William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, married Kathleen Kennedy, daughter of Joseph Kennedy and sister of the future President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Lord Hartington was killed in the Second World War in 1944 shortly after the marriage. The couple had no children.

Devonshire was therefore succeeded by his second and only surviving son, the eleventh Duke. He sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and held political office (under his uncle Harold Macmillan and later under Sir Alec Douglas-Home) from 1960 to 1964. Devonshire married the Hon. Deborah Mitford, the youngest of the famous Mitford sisters. As of 2022, the titles are held by their second and only surviving son, Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire, who succeeded in 2004.

The ninth and tenth dukes both served as Chancellor of the University of Leeds.

===Other notable members of the Cavendish family===
Numerous other members of the Cavendish family have also gained distinction. Lord Henry Cavendish (1673–1700), second son of the first Duke, was Member of Parliament for Derby. Lord James Cavendish (died 1751), third son of the first Duke, also represented this constituency in the House of Commons. Lord Charles Cavendish (1704–1783), second son of the second Duke, was a politician and scientist. His son Henry Cavendish (1731–1810) was an influential scientist noted for his discovery of hydrogen. Lord James Cavendish (1701–1741), third son of the second Duke, was a soldier and briefly represented Malton in Parliament. Lord George Cavendish (died 1794), second son of the third Duke, was a long-standing Member of Parliament and served as Comptroller of the Household from 1761 to 1762. Lord Frederick Cavendish, third son of the third Duke, was a Field Marshal in the Army. Lord John Cavendish, fourth son of the third Duke, was a politician and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1782 and 1783.
Lord Richard Cavendish, second son of the fourth Duke, represented Lancaster and Derbyshire in the House of Commons. Lady Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of the fourth Duke, married Prime Minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (who assumed the additional surname of Cavendish). Augustus Clifford, illegitimate son by the fifth Duke and his mistress and later second wife Elizabeth Hervey, was a naval commander and was created a baronet in 1838 (see Clifford baronets). William Cavendish, eldest son of the first Earl of Burlington and father of the seventh Duke, represented Aylesbury and Derby in Parliament. George Henry Compton Cavendish, second son of the first Earl of Burlington, was Member of Parliament for Aylesbury. The Hon. Henry Frederick Compton Cavendish, third son of the first Earl of Burlington, was a general in the Army. The Hon. Charles Compton Cavendish, fourth son of the first Earl of Burlington, was created Baron Chesham in 1858.

Lord Frederick Cavendish, third son of the seventh Duke, was a Liberal politician. He had just been appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1882 when he was assassinated by nationalists in Phoenix Park, Dublin. His wife Lady Frederick (Lucy) Cavendish was a pioneer of women&#x27;s education. Lord Edward Cavendish, fourth and youngest son of the seventh Duke, sat as Member of Parliament for several constituencies. His second son Lord Richard Cavendish represented North Lonsdale in Parliament. In 1911 he was one of the proposed recipients of peerages in case the Bill that was to become the Parliament Act 1911 was not accepted by the House of Lords. His grandson Hugh Cavendish was created a life peer as Baron Cavendish of Furness in 1990. Lady Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of the ninth Duke, was the wife of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.

===Courtesy titles and family seats===
The Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s eldest son may use the courtesy title &quot;Marquess of Hartington&quot;, whilst the eldest son of the eldest son may use the title &quot;Earl of Burlington&quot;, and his eldest son may use the title &quot;Lord Cavendish&quot;.
The family seats are Chatsworth House, Bolton Abbey in Yorkshire, and Lismore Castle in County Waterford, in the Republic of Ireland. Compton Place in Eastbourne belongs to the family (which developed Eastbourne as a seaside resort in the 19th century) but is let. In 1908 Holker Hall, then in Lancashire, now in Cumbria, was left to a junior branch of the family. The family previously owned Londesborough Hall, Yorkshire; Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire; Chiswick House, Middlesex; and two London mansions on Piccadilly: Devonshire House and Burlington House. In 1907 the Duke owned 192,322 acres across the British Isles, principally in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, County Cork and County Waterford.

The traditional burial place of the Dukes of Devonshire is at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Edensor, in the closest village to Chatsworth House. The ducal graves can be found on the highest spot of Edensor&#x27;s churchyard in the Cavendish family plot.

==Earls of Devonshire==
The earldom of Devonshire was originally granted as a recreation of the title held by the last Baron Mountjoy, which became extinct on his death in 1606.

It is a separate title from that of Earl of Devon, which still belongs to the Courtenay family.

==In fiction==
The fifth Duke and Duchess of Devonshire are portrayed in the 2008 film &quot;The Duchess&quot; directed by Saul Dibb. The film is based on Amanda Foreman&#x27;s biography of the scandalous 18th-century English aristocrat Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (portrayed by Keira Knightley) and her relationship with the Duke (Ralph Fiennes) and his next wife, Lady Elizabeth Foster.

Along with Jane Austen, the fifth Duke and his second wife appear, soon after Georgiana&#x27;s death, in &quot;Jane and the Stillroom Maid&quot;, a murder mystery by Stephanie Barron.

In John Buchan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Three Hostages&quot; (1924), &#x27;the late Duke of Devonshire&#x27; is cited as an epitome of Englishness. This probably refers to the eighth duke.

In the episode &#x27;The Man in the Killer Suit&#x27; in the 2014 TV series &quot;Forever&quot;, a case occurs where someone masquerades as a &#x27;viscount cavendish&#x27;. While the title is wrongly used, other references during the episode show that they are in fact referring to the Dukes of Devonshire.

<text>Bellevue (French for &quot;beautiful view&quot;; previously named Belleview) is a suburban city in Sarpy County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Omaha–Council Bluffs metropolitan area, and had a population of 64,176 as of the 2020 census, making it the 3rd most populous city in Nebraska, behind Omaha and Lincoln, and the second largest city in the U.S. named &quot;Bellevue,&quot; behind Bellevue, Washington.

==History==
Established by European Americans in the 1830s, Bellevue was incorporated in 1855 and is the oldest continuously-inhabited town in Nebraska. It has been credited by the Nebraska State Legislature as being the state&#x27;s second-oldest incorporated settlement after Nebraska City; previously it served as the seat of government in Nebraska.

Bellevue was originally founded as a trading post for the Missouri Fur Company by Joshua Pilcher, but there were financial problems, and, eventually, Lucien Fontanelle became the owner of the post, and the first permanent resident of Bellevue. Moses Merrill founded a mission, which was the first Christian mission in Nebraska, in Bellevue. Since it was the oldest city in the Nebraska Territory, the residents were optimistic that Bellevue would become the capital of it, and the new territorial governor, Francis Burt, had already moved there, but shortly after, he died. The next governor selected Omaha as the capital instead. In 1921, the Offutt Air Force Base, housing the United States Strategic Command, was built south of Bellevue. The planes that dropped the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs were built there.

The 2019 Midwestern U.S. floods destroyed about 200 homes from the swelling of the Missouri River.

<text>Gretna is a city in Sarpy County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 9,071 at the 2022 census.

==History==
Gretna started shortly after the Burlington Railroad built a short line between Omaha and Ashland in the summer of 1886. Advent of the village of Gretna on this new laid rail line was the cue for the exit of the nearby trading post of Forest City, which had existed since 1856. In its day, Forest City, located 2.5 miles southwest of where Gretna now stands, was a flourishing and busy place, but it was doomed by the railroad which passed it by. The only markers that exist today to show the site of old Forest City is the cemetery (Holy Sepulchre) which is located a little to the east of what was the center of activity in the settlement and the 1886 homestead originally owned by the Schnack Family and located on Schnack Acres at 234th St. Names that were prominent in the beginnings of Forest City were the families of Adolph Schnack, William Langdon, John Thomas and John Conner.

The Lincoln Land Company, recognizing the potential of the site, surveyed and platted the town site of Gretna in 1887. The village was incorporated by July 10, 1889. The name suggests Scotland&#x27;s Gretna Green, the ancestral county of some of the earliest settlers.

<text>Offutt Air Force Base is a U.S. Air Force base south of Omaha, adjacent to Bellevue in Sarpy County, Nebraska. It is the headquarters of the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), the 557th Weather Wing, and the 55th Wing (55 WG) of the Air Combat Command (ACC), the latter serving as the host unit.

Aviation use at Offutt began in September 1918 during World War I as an Army Air Service balloon field. Originally named Fort Crook, it was renamed in honor of World War I pilot and Omaha native 1st Lt. Jarvis Offutt in 1924.

Offutt AFB&#x27;s legacy includes the construction of the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bockscar&quot;, the planes that dropped Little Boy and Fat Man over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. Offutt served over 40 years as the headquarters for the former Strategic Air Command (SAC) and home for its associated ground and aerial command centers for the United States in the case of nuclear war during the Cold War. The population was 8,901 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Offutt AFB is named in honor of First Lieutenant Jarvis Jenness Offutt (26 October 1894 – 13 August 1918). The first native of Omaha to become a casualty in World War I, Lieutenant Offutt died of injuries sustained when his SE-5 fighter crashed during a training flight near Valheureux, France. The airfield portion of Fort Crook was designated Offutt Field on 6 May 1924.

===Fort Crook===
Offutt&#x27;s history began with the commissioning by the War Department in 1890 of Fort Crook. Located some 10 miles south of Omaha and two miles west of the Missouri River, the fort was constructed between 1894 and 1896. The fort&#x27;s namesake was Major General George Crook, a Civil War veteran and Indian fighter.

It was first used as a dispatch point for Indian conflicts on the Great Plains. Troops from Fort Crook fought during the Spanish–American War when the 22nd Regiment under Charles A. Wikoff was dispatched to Cuba. The regiment suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of El Caney. Only 165 of the 513 regiment members survived with most succumbing to tropical diseases after the battle.

The oldest surviving portion of Fort Crook is the parade grounds and surrounding red brick buildings that were constructed between 1894 and 1896. These structures are still in active use today as squadron headquarters, living quarters for high-ranking generals (Generals Row), and Nebraska&#x27;s oldest operational jail.

===Offutt Field===

In 1918, the 61st Balloon Company of the Army Air Corps was assigned to Fort Crook at the close of World War I, which performed combat reconnaissance training. In the spring of 1921, the plowing, leveling, and seeding of 260 acres of land at Fort Crook created an airfield suitable for frequent takeoffs and landings and as a refueling stop for mail and transcontinental flights. The first permanent aircraft hangars were completed in 1921. Other known organizations assigned to the field were the 74th Balloon Company in November 1918; 60th Balloon Company in December 1918.

On 6 May 1924, the airfield was officially named &quot;Offutt Field&quot;. The field accommodated interim reserve flying training and regular Post Office Department airmail flights during the 1920s and 1930s; a small detachment of enlisted men (detached service) from Marshall Field and Fort Riley, Kansas, constituted the only military presence on the field between 1935 and 1940.

===Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant===
In 1940 as American involvement in World War II loomed, the Army Air Corps chose Offutt Field as the site for a new bomber plant that was to be operated by the Glenn L. Martin Company. The plant&#x27;s construction included a two-mile (3.2 km)-long concrete runway, six large hangars, and a aircraft-assembly building.

Production switched to B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombers in 1944, and 531 Superfortresses were produced before the end of World War II. Among these were the &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bockscar&quot;, the B-29s that dropped the first atomic weapons to be used in a military action (against the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan).

Production ended on 18 September 1945, when the last B-29 rolled out of the assembly building. With the manufacturing plant&#x27;s closure, custody of the airfield and ground facilities were assumed by the 4131st Army Air Force Base Unit, Air Materiel Command.

===Postwar use===

In the initial months after the end of World War II, Offutt was used by the 2474th Separation Processing squadron to demobilize service members out of the armed forces after their return from overseas duty. In June 1946, the Army Air Force re-designated Fort Crook and the Martin-Nebraska facilities as Offutt Field. It became the headquarters for the Air Defense Command Second Air Force on 6 June. In 1947, the airfield opened for operational use, with the 381st Bombardment Group being assigned to the field with one squadron of B-29 Superfortresses, although the facility remained primarily a separation center.

The newly established United States Air Force took control of the facility in September 1947, and on 13 January 1948, it was renamed Offutt Air Force Base. Later that same year, on 26 September, the 3902nd Air Base Group (later Wing) became the host unit at Offutt under A. J. Beck.

===Strategic Air Command===

On 9 November 1948, Offutt became the host base for Headquarters Strategic Air Command, which was moved from Andrews AFB, Maryland. Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington chose to locate the Air Force&#x27;s long-range atomic strike force at Offutt primarily because the base was centrally located on the North American continent, placing it well beyond the existing range of long-range, nuclear-armed bombers to (then) stay safely out of range of hostile missiles or bomber aircraft.

Offutt&#x27;s population and facilities grew dramatically to keep pace with the increased operational demands during the Cold War. Several new dormitories and more than 2,000 family housing units – built in the late 1950s and 1960s under incremental Wherry and Capehart projects – quickly replaced the old quarters of Fort Crook. Headquarters SAC moved from the Martin-Nebraska complex to Building 500 in 1957, and new base facilities in the 1960s and 1970s included a hospital, main exchange, commissary, and library.

During the late 1950s, Offutt housed a Royal Air Force facility for servicing Avro Vulcans, which visited the air base frequently while on exercise with SAC.

Operational use of Offutt Air Force Base included the basing of alert tankers in the late 1950s and 1960s, support for intercontinental ballistic missile sites in Nebraska and Iowa in the 1960s, and worldwide reconnaissance from the mid-1960s to the present.

To provide air defense of the base, the United States Army established the Offutt AFB Defense Area, and Nike-Hercules surface-to-air missile sites were constructed during 1959. Sites were located near Cedar Creek, Nebraska (OF-60) , and Council Bluffs, Iowa (OF-10) . They were operational between November 1960 and March 1966. The missiles were operated by the 6th Battalion, 43rd Artillery.

During the Cold War, a general and various support personnel from the base were airborne 24 hours a day on an EC-135 from 3 February 1961 to 24 July 1990 in Operation Looking Glass, creating an airborne command post in case of war.

The 3902d Air Base Wing was inactivated on 1 March 1986, and the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing assumed host-unit responsibilities for Offutt. Increased defense spending during the 1980s brought additional operational improvements to Offutt, including the Bennie Davis Aircraft Maintenance Hangar, and a new command center for Headquarters SAC.

===U.S. Strategic Command===

Offutt again faced changes in 1992 when the easing of world tensions allowed the United States to reorganize the Air Force. The Strategic Air Command was inactivated on 1 June, succeeded by the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), a Unified Combatant Command of the Department of Defense. The 55th Strategic Wing then became the 55th Wing, under the newly created Air Combat Command.

In 1998, the Strategic Air and Space Museum moved 30 miles (48 km) southwest to Ashland, just off Interstate 80, midway between Omaha and Lincoln.

In 2005, Offutt began several major renovations. The on-base Wherry housing area was demolished for replacement with new housing. A new fire house, AAFES mini-mall, and U.S. Post Office were completed in 2006. Additionally, the Air Force Weather Agency broke ground on a new facility which was completed in 2008.

The new headquarters for STRATCOM, the Command and Control Facility (C2F), is expected to be operational in September 2018.

The base sustained significant damage in the spring of 2019 as a result of the Missouri River flooding; at one point, almost half of the base&#x27;s runway was underwater. Flight operations and some support staff were temporarily relocated to nearby Lincoln Air National Guard Base while repairs (as well as some pre-planned construction projects) were undertaken.

===President Bush Offutt Conference on 11 September 2001===
On 11 September 2001, President George W. Bush conducted one of the first major strategy sessions for the response to the September 11 attacks from a bunker at the base.

Bush, who was in Florida at the Emma Booker Elementary School in Sarasota at the time of the attacks, first flew from Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana and then to Offutt en route back to Washington, DC. Bush arrived at 2:50pm, conducted a video conference in an underground command bunker and left for Washington, DC at 4:30pm.

Air Force One left Barksdale AFB for Offutt AFB around 1:30 p.m. The Air Force One entourage was pared down to a few essential staffers such as Ari Fleischer, Andrew Card, Karl Rove, Dan Bartlett, Brian Montgomery, and Gordon Johndroe, plus about five reporters. During the flight, Bush remained in &quot;continuous contact&quot; with both the White House Situation Room and Vice President Dick Cheney in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.

Air Force One landed at Offutt shortly before 3:00 p.m. At 3:06 p.m, Bush passed through security to the US Strategic Command Underground Command Center () and was taken into an underground bunker designed to withstand a nuclear blast. There, he held a teleconference call with Vice President Cheney, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, CIA Director George Tenet, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, and others. The meeting lasted about an hour. Rice recalled that during the meeting, Tenet told Bush, &quot;Sir, I believe it&#x27;s al-Qaeda. We&#x27;re doing the assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al-Qaeda.&quot; The White House staff was preparing for Bush to address the nation from the Offutt bunker, but Bush decided instead to return to Washington. Air Force One left Offutt around 4:30 p.m.

===Whistleblower suit===
In May 2011, base civilian employee George Sarris successfully settled with the government over claims that he was subjected to retaliation for talking to the media in 2008 about poor maintenance of RC-135 aircraft at the base. After Sarris&#x27; allegations appeared in the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot;, base officials revoked his security clearance and reassigned him to menial duties. Later investigations by the government substantiated many of Sarris&#x27; claims. As part of the settlement, the USAF agreed to pay Sarris his full salary until he retired in 2014 and paid $21,000 of his attorney&#x27;s fees. After retiring, Sarris published a book titled, &quot;Cowardice in Leadership – A Lesson in Harassment, Intimidation, and Reprisals&quot;. Ten years after Sarris blew the whistle, the &quot;Omaha World Herald&quot; published a three-part series titled &quot;In-flight emergency&quot;, which confirmed his earlier claims.

===Intercontinental ballistic missile facilities===

The 549th Strategic Missile Squadron operated three SM-65D Atlas ICBM sites (1 October 1960 – 15 December 1964). Each site was composed of three missile silos (9 total).
* 549-A, 3.4 mi SE of Mead, NE 
* 549-B, 3.6 mi NE of Arlington, NE 
* 549-C, 4.3 mi SE of Missouri Valley, IA 

Beginning in 1958, the Army Corps of Engineers began planning for the sites, and construction began in 1959. The construction project was completed on 28 July 1960. In April and May 1961, the three complexes became the last Atlas D missiles to go on alert.

The missiles were manned by the 549th Strategic Missile Squadron which was activated on 1 October 1960. The squadron began to phase down with the inactivation of the Atlas-D on 1 October 1964, and was inactivated 14 December 1964. Confusingly, the squadron was originally the 566th but on 1 July 1961 SAC swapped designators with the 549th at F.E. Warren AFB. The 549th SMS was under the 385th Strategic Aerospace Wing.

Site &quot;A&quot; was abandoned for many years, until the late 1970s when the Nebraska National Guard took over ownership of the site to establish a training area called the Mead Training Site. The site is managed by the Camp Ashland Training Site Command. The training area has been used by the National Guard, United States Air Force, local law enforcement, and other entities as a training site for many years. 3/209th RTI out of Camp Ashland began using Mead Training Site in 2008 as the primary training facility for their 88M military occupational specialty reclassification school and continues to use the site year round. A MOUT site (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) was constructed at the site in 2009. Two Nebraska National Guard armories were built directly alongside the training area in 2012. Many other National Guard units use the site for drill weekends and annual trainings. Airmen out of Offutt Air Force Base practice Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) Training at the site several weekends a year.

Site &quot;B&quot; is in use for agricultural storage. Site &quot;C&quot; has been demolished, with only the access roads remaining.

===1983 killings===
Serial killer John Joubert murdered two boys while stationed at the base in 1983.

===2019 shooting===
In September 2019, a shooting took place in Offutt&#x27;s private housing community, in which Sgt. Zachary Firlik and his wife Kari Firlik were killed. The case was identified as a murder-suicide. The shooter, Zachary Firlik, was an active off-duty airman who killed his wife and then himself. Their five year-old daughter was downstairs at the time, and fled the house after hearing gunshots. 

==Role and operations==

Most of the base is in the Bellevue Public Schools school district. A portion is in the Papillion-La Vista School District.

==Offutt in popular culture==
Offutt was brought to popular attention during its SAC period when the command was depicted in the 1955 film &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; starring Jimmy Stewart, the 1963 film &quot;A Gathering of Eagles&quot; starring Rock Hudson, and 1964&#x27;s &quot;Fail-Safe&quot; starring Henry Fonda (which not only claimed to show portions of the base but also a nearby Omaha neighborhood) and &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot; starring Peter Sellers (which depicts a nuclear first strike from a mad general at the fictional Burpelson Air Force Base).

Offutt appeared in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot; (identified as &#x27;the Omaha installation&#x27;), when a fighter pilot stationed there detects the approaching USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and is transported aboard.

The Dale Brown novel &quot;Plan of Attack&quot; saw nuclear missiles launched by Russian bombers attacking multiple bomber bases all over the U.S, including Offutt, which is destroyed by four Kh-15 (AS-17 Kickback) missiles. Only one Boeing E-4 NEACP escapes in time, and the officials of the Eighth Air Force and STRATCOM are eliminated in the process. Pat Frank&#x27;s iconic Cold War novel &quot;Alas, Babylon&quot; (1959) has Air Force Colonel Mark Bragg, the brother of the protagonist Randy Bragg, stationed at Offutt.

In the 1983 post apocalyptic feature film for television, &quot;The Day After&quot;, Offutt is represented as a SAC Aircraft departs the field as the cameras then change focus to the countryside as the credits roll.

Offutt is also mentioned in Strike Three, a post-apocalyptic novel, by Joy V. Smith.

An aerial view of Offutt is used as a photographic reference on an SCPF Secure Facility Dossier for Site-19.

<text>Papillion is a city in and the county seat of Sarpy County, Nebraska, United States. The city developed in the 1870s as a railroad town and suburb of Omaha. The city is part of the larger five-county metro area of Omaha. Papillion&#x27;s population was 24,159 at the 2020 census, making it the 7th most populous city in Nebraska. Its growth since the late 20th century has reflected Omaha&#x27;s.

Google and Meta Platforms have several Data centers in Papillion.

==Description==
The city was named after the creek of the same name which flows through its center; this had been named by early French explorers, as France had claimed this territory through the eighteenth century. The name Papillion is derived from the French term (&quot;papillon&quot;) for butterfly. According to local tradition, the early French explorers named the creek as &quot;Papillon&quot; because they saw so many butterflies along its grassy banks. The spelling was changed through a transliteration of the French word.

Papillion was platted in 1870 when the railroad was extended to that point. Papillion (sometimes referred to as &quot;Papio&quot; by its residents) is one of the last of the late 18th-century, Paris-inspired frontier cities left in the Midwestern United States.

Halleck Park, a recreation area in the heart of the city, includes many trails, open spaces, trees and a number of areas of interest, including Papio Fun Park, Papio Bay Aquatic Park, Papio Pool, and Papio Bowl. The park also offers tennis courts, volleyball courts, playgrounds, &quot;The Duck Pond&quot;, Monarch Field (&quot;The Pit&quot;), and E.A. Fricke Field.

It also has nine other softball diamonds within the park for youth. The diamonds are sited on three fields: Halleck, Blonde, and Papio Bay. Village Park, Papio Bay Aquatic Center (including two water slides and a zero depth pool) and Walnut Creek recreational park are among the other recreational amenities in the city.
Papillion Middle School is in the downtown area south of Papio Creek; the building formerly was used as the high school until August 1971. The former junior high was located directly west, across the street.

Also downtown are the Old A.W. Clarke banking house, Sump Memorial Library, Portal One-Room School House, Papillion Municipal Building (Sarpy County Courthouse until 1970), and the John Sautter House. Other areas of interest in Papillion include the Sarpy County Court House and Jail, Shadow Lake Towne Center, and Midlands Hospital, all along Nebraska Highway 370 in the southern portion of the city.

Papillion has a Triple-A Minor League Baseball team. Werner Park, located west of the city on Highway 370 in unincorporated Sarpy County, opened in 2011 as the new home of the Omaha Storm Chasers of the Pacific Coast League. The Storm Chasers were formerly the Omaha Royals; after 42 years at Rosenblatt Stadium in south Omaha, the team moved out following the 2010 season and changed their nickname. They have been the only Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals, an expansion club that entered the American League in 1969. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Storm Chasers were placed into the new Triple-A East.

<text>Ashland is a city in Saunders County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 3,262 at the 2022 census.

==History==
Ashland is located at the site of a low-water limestone ledge along the bottom of Salt Creek, an otherwise mud-bottomed stream that was a formidable obstacle for wagon trains on the great westward migrations of the late 1840s and 1850s. The Oxbow Trail, a variant route of the Oregon Trail, ran from Nebraska City (on the Missouri River) to Fort Kearny (on the Platte River), where it joined the main route of the Oregon Trail. The limestone bottom of Salt Creek at Ashland made it an excellent fording site.
Ashland was established in 1870 and named after Ashland, the estate of Henry Clay.

Today, Ashland benefits by its proximity to Interstate 80 and the cities of Omaha and Lincoln. While in some respects Ashland is becoming a &quot;bedroom community&quot; of those much larger cities, it retains a rural character. That coherence as a community, and a 30-minute drive to either of the state&#x27;s economic hubs, has led to a building boom in the late 1990s and the 2000s.

The nightly recap of the Top Ten List at the CBS website was titled &quot;The Wahoo Gazette&quot;.

By 1900, the Burlington Railroad laid tracks into the town and placed a discarded boxcar next to the tracks as a temporary depot.

<text>Garland, formerly known as Germantown, is a village in Seward County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Lincoln, Nebraska Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 216 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1874, the Midland Pacific Railroad built the first railway in Seward County, laying tracks from Lincoln to Seward. To finance the construction of the new line, the railroad sought money from the county. However, the residents of the southern portion of the county voted overwhelmingly against the bond issue in an 1871 election: they were displeased at having been bypassed by an earlier railroad line, anticipated no benefits from the new line, and were angry with Seward, which had won the county seat away from the southern town of Milford. The failure of the bond issue forced the railroad to seek support from the northern portions of the county; so rather than following the desirable route up the valley of Middle Creek, the company agreed to build the line through Malcolm and then up into the hills of northeastern Seward County. This measure won enough support for the bonds to be approved in 1872.

A depot was established on a level place along the line, and the town of Germantown, named for the ethnicity of the local settlers, was platted in 1874 by Hiland Fraisure.

With the entry of the United States into World War I, anti-German sentiment was rampant. German-language newspapers were closed and German-language Lutheran church services were ended. Sauerkraut was dubbed &quot;liberty cabbage&quot;, and dachshunds &quot;liberty hounds&quot;. In this environment, the Germantown city council decided that the name had to be changed; and they resolved to rename the town after the first local soldier to die during the war. Although several residents later fell by enemy action, the resolution had failed to specify the manner of death; so the honor went to Raymond Garland, who died of pneumonia before he ever reached France. On December 11, 1918, a month after the signing of the Armistice, Germantown became Garland.

==Popular culture==
Hazard was the setting of the Richard Marx song &quot;Hazard&quot;. Marx arrived at the name because he liked the lyric &quot;this old Nebraska town.&quot; He wrote to Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, asking for a list of Nebraska towns with two syllables and found Hazard ideal for its double meaning (The lyrics refer to a river, which the real Hazard does not possess; however, there is a muddy creek).

Although the song did not cast the town in a positive light, the residents invited Marx to be Grand Marshal at Sherman County&#x27;s Fourth of July parade in 1993, an invite that the singer accepted.

<text>Alexandria is a village in Thayer County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 146 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In the 1840s and 1850s, the Oregon Trail passed through present-day Thayer County, following the Little Blue River through southeastern Nebraska before crossing into the valley of the Platte River. Settlers arrived along the trail in the late 1850s. The first permanent white residents of the county arrived in 1858, settling about two and a half miles (about four kilometers) south of present-day Alexandria, on the divide between the Little Blue and Big Sandy Creek. In 1859, Isaac Alexander arrived from Kansas with a portable gristmill; he settled on Big Sandy Creek, where he built a log cabin and stockade.

In 1872, the St. Joseph and Denver Railroad (later the St. Joseph and Grand Island) was extended into Thayer County. The railroad passed through the Alexander family&#x27;s property. At the railroad&#x27;s behest, the Nebraska Land and Town Company platted towns along its route, naming them in alphabetical order; the easternmost of these was Alexandria, followed by Belvidere, Carleton, and Davenport. The town was named after Isaac Alexander&#x27;s son, S. J. Alexander, who had been involved in negotiating the railroad&#x27;s route through Thayer County, and who later served as Nebraska&#x27;s Secretary of State.

Alexandria grew rapidly; its early growth was augmented by residents and businesses moving from the town of Meridian, established as the county seat of Jones County (now Jefferson County) but bypassed by the railroad and eventually abandoned. The town supported a flour mill on Big Sandy Creek; a newspaper, the &quot;Alexandrian&quot;, was established in 1879; and by 1882, there were four churches.

The town was beset by three severe storms in the decade following its establishment. In 1875, a tornado levelled a school building that had just been completed at a cost of $6,000. A second storm, in 1877, did only minor damage; a third, in 1881, produced several fatalities and widespread property damage.

<text>Seneca is an unincorporated community in Thomas County, Nebraska in the Great Plains region of the United States. The population was 33 at the 2010 census.

Seneca was established on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1888. The location of a division point on the railroad, it was for some years the largest settlement in Thomas County. The population dwindled following the closing of the railroad roundhouse. In 2014, after a dispute on the village board, the residents voted to disincorporate the village.

==History==
The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad was constructed along the Middle Loup River in the late 1880s. Construction was halted for the winter of 1887–88 in western Thomas County, and the town of Seneca was established at that point in January 1888.

Seneca became a division point on the railroad, with a depot, rail yard, and roundhouse, employing over 70 people. Railroad operations brought a measure of prosperity to the town, and promoted its growth. Between 1918 and 1923, the Potash Highway, running from Grand Island to Alliance, was constructed parallel to the Burlington&#x27;s route; it ran through the center of Seneca. The town boasted a number of retail businesses, including hotels, banks, a lumberyard, a railroad cafe, and an automobile dealership. For some years, it was the largest municipality in Thomas County, reaching a peak population of 476 in 1920.

In 1926, the Potash Highway was reconfigured as Nebraska Highway 2. In the early 1940s, a re-alignment to reduce the number of railroad crossings shifted the highway to the south of Seneca. The railroad moved its operations out of the town, eliminating jobs and causing the loss of population and the closing of additional businesses.

In about 2013, a dispute arose over the village board&#x27;s passage of an ordinance prohibiting the keeping of horses in the town. It gave rise to a petition to disincorporate Seneca. In May 2014, the residents voted 17–16 for disincorporation, and the village was dissolved by the Thomas County Board at the end of June 2014.

<text>Buxton is a spa town in the Borough of High Peak, Derbyshire, in the East Midlands region of England. It is England&#x27;s highest market town, sited at some above sea level. It lies close to Cheshire to the west and Staffordshire to the south, on the edge of the Peak District National Park. In 1974, the municipal borough merged with other nearby boroughs, including Glossop, to form the local government district and borough of High Peak. 

The town population was 22,115 at the 2011 Census. Sights include Poole&#x27;s Cavern, a limestone cavern; St Ann&#x27;s Well, fed by a geothermal spring bottled by Buxton Mineral Water Company; and many historic buildings, including John Carr&#x27;s restored Buxton Crescent, Henry Currey&#x27;s Buxton Baths and Frank Matcham&#x27;s Buxton Opera House. The Devonshire Campus of the University of Derby occupies historic premises. Buxton is twinned with Oignies in France and Bad Nauheim in Germany.

== History ==
The origins of the name are unclear. It may derive from the Old English for Buck Stone or for Rocking Stone. The town grew in importance in the late 18th century, when it was developed by the Dukes of Devonshire, with a resurgence a century later as Victorians were drawn to the reputed healing properties of its waters.

=== Stone Age beginnings ===
The first inhabitants of Buxton made homes at Lismore Fields some 6,000 years ago. This Stone Age settlement, a scheduled monument, was rediscovered in 1984, with remains of a Mesolithic timber roundhouse and Neolithic longhouses.

=== Roman settlement ===
The Romans developed a settlement known as Aquae Arnemetiae (&quot;Baths of the grove goddess&quot;). Coins found show the Romans were in Buxton throughout their occupation of Britain.

Batham Gate (&quot;road to the bath town&quot;) is a Roman road from Templebrough Roman fort in South Yorkshire to Navio Roman Fort and on to Buxton.

=== Middle Ages ===
The name &quot;Buckestones&quot; was first recorded in the 12th century as part of the Peverel family&#x27;s estate. From 1153 the town was within the Duchy of Lancaster&#x27;s Crown estate, close to the Royal Forest of the Peak on the Fairfield side of the River Wye. Monastic farms were set up in Fairfield in the 13th century and in the 14th; its royal ownership was reflected in the name of &quot;Kyngesbucstones&quot;.

By 1460, Buxton&#x27;s spring had been pronounced a holy one dedicated to St Anne, who was canonised in 1382. A chapel had appeared there by 1498.

=== Spa town boom ===
Built on the River Wye, and overlooked by Axe Edge Moor, Buxton became a spa town for its geothermal spring, which gushes at a steady 28 °C.

The spring waters are piped to St Ann&#x27;s Well, a shrine since medieval times at the foot of The Slopes, opposite the Crescent and near the town centre. The well was called one of the Seven Wonders of the Peak by the philosopher Thomas Hobbes in his 1636 book &quot;De Mirabilibus Pecci: Being The Wonders of the Peak in Darby-shire.&quot;

The Dukes of Devonshire became involved in 1780, when the William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire used profits from his copper mines to develop it as a spa in the style of Bath. Their ancestor Bess of Hardwick had brought one of her four husbands, the Earl of Shrewsbury, to &quot;take the waters&quot; at Buxton in 1569, shortly after he became the gaoler of Mary, Queen of Scots, and took Mary there in 1573. She called Buxton &quot;La Fontagne de Bogsby&quot;. She stayed at the site of the Old Hall Hotel, where Earl of Shrewsbury had built a lodging for visitors. According to John Jones of Derby, author of &quot;Buxtone&#x27;s Bathes Benefyte&quot; (1572), the visitors to Shrewsbury&#x27;s &quot;goodly house&quot; enjoyed a game of table bowls known as &quot;trou madame&quot;. 
The area features in the works of W. H. Auden, Jane Austen and Emily Brontë. Buxton&#x27;s profile was boosted by a recommendation from Erasmus Darwin of the waters there and at Matlock, addressed to Josiah Wedgwood I. The Wedgwood family often visited Buxton and commended the area to their friends. Two of Charles Darwin&#x27;s half-cousins, Edward Levett Darwin and Reginald Darwin, settled there. The arrival of the railway in 1863 stimulated growth: the population of 1,800 in 1861 exceeded 6,000 by 1881.

=== 20th century ===
Buxton held a base for British and Canadian troops in the First World War. Granville Military Hospital was set up at the Buxton Hydropathic Hotel, with the Palace Hotel annexed. The author Vera Brittain trained as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse at the Devonshire Hospital in 1915. The Royal Engineers based in Buxton used the Pavilion Gardens&#x27; lakes for training to build pontoon bridges. Prisoner of war camps at Ladmanlow and Peak Dale were established in 1917 to supply workers for the local limestone quarries.

RAF Harpur Hill became an underground bomb-storage facility during World War II and the country&#x27;s largest munitions dump. It was also the base for the Peak District section of the RAF Mountain Rescue Service. Prisoner of war camps for Italians and Germans were set up on Lismore Road, off Macclesfield Road and at Dove Holes.

After a decline as a spa resort in the earlier 20th century, Buxton had a resurgence in the 1950s and 1970s. The Playhouse Theatre kept a repertory company and pop concerts were held at the Octagon (including the Beatles in 1963). The Opera House re-opened in 1979 with the launch of the Buxton Festival, and the town was being used as a base for exploring the Peak District.

== Geography and geology ==
Although outside the National Park boundary, Buxton is in the western part of the Peak District, between the Lower Carboniferous limestone of the White Peak to the east and the Upper Carboniferous shale, sandstone and gritstone of the Dark Peak to the west. The early settlement (of which only the parish church of St Anne, built in 1625, remains) was largely made of limestone, while the present buildings of locally quarried sandstone, mostly date from the late 18th century.

At the south edge of the town, the River Wye has carved an extensive limestone cavern known as Poole&#x27;s Cavern. More than 330 yards (300 metres) of its chambers are open to the public. It contains Derbyshire&#x27;s largest stalactite and some unique &quot;poached egg&quot; stalagmites. Its name recalls a local highwayman.

=== Climate ===
Buxton has an oceanic climate with short, mild summers and long, cool winters. At about above sea level, Buxton is the highest market town in England. Buxton&#x27;s elevation makes it cooler and wetter than surrounding towns, with a daytime temperature typically about 2 °C lower than Manchester.

A Met Office weather station has collected climate data for the town since 1867, with digitised data from 1959 available online. In June 1975, the town suffered a freak snowstorm that stopped play during a cricket match.

== Notable architecture ==

The many visitors to Buxton for its thermal waters, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, led to several new buildings to provide hospitality facilities.

The Old Hall Hotel is one of the town&#x27;s oldest buildings. It was owned by George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, who with his wife, Bess of Hardwick, acted as the &quot;gaolers&quot; of Mary, Queen of Scots, who came to Buxton several times to take the waters, her final visit being in 1584. The present building dates from 1670, and has a five-bay front with a Tuscan doorway.
The Grade I listed Crescent was built in 1780–1784 for the 5th Duke of Devonshire, as part of his effort to turn Buxton into a fashionable spa town. Modelled on Bath&#x27;s Royal Crescent, it was designed by architect John Carr, together with the neighbouring irregular octagon and colonnade of the Great Stables. These were completed in 1789, but in 1859 were largely converted to a charity hospital for the &quot;sick poor&quot; by Henry Currey, architect to the 7th Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s. Currey had previously worked on St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London. It became known as the Devonshire Royal Hospital in 1934. Later phases of conversion after 1881 were by local architect Robert Rippon Duke, including his design for The Devonshire Dome as the world&#x27;s largest unsupported dome, with a diameter of – larger than the Pantheon at , St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica at in Rome, and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral at . The record was surpassed only by space frame domes such as the Georgia Dome (). The building and its surrounding Victorian villas are now part of the University of Derby.
Currey also designed the Grade II listed Buxton Baths, comprising the Natural Mineral Baths to the west of The Crescent and Buxton Thermal Baths to the east, which opened in 1854 on the site of the original Roman baths, together with the 1884 Pump Room opposite. The Thermal Baths, closed in 1963 and at risk of demolition, were restored and converted into a shopping arcade by conservation architects Derek Latham and Company. Architectural artist Brian Clarke contributed to the refurbishment; his scheme, designed in 1984 and completed in 1987, was for a landmark modern artwork, a barrel-vaulted modern stained glass ceiling to enclose the former baths — at the time the largest stained glass window in the British Isles — creating an atrial space for what became the Cavendish Arcade. Visitors could &quot;take the waters&quot; at The Pump Room until 1981. Between 1981 and 1995 the building housed the Buxton Micrarium Exhibition, an interactive display with 50 remote-controlled microscopes. The building was refurbished as part of the National Lottery-funded Buxton Crescent and Thermal Spa re-development. Beside it, added in 1940, is St Ann&#x27;s Well. In October 2020 Ensana reopened the Crescent as a 5-star spa hotel, after a 17-year refurbishment.

Nearby stands the imposing monument to Samuel Turner (1805–1878), treasurer of the Devonshire Hospital and Buxton Bath Charity, built in 1879 and accidentally lost for the latter part of the 20th century during construction work, before being found and restored in 1994.

When the railways arrived in Buxton in 1863, Buxton railway station had been designed by Joseph Paxton, previously gardener and architect to William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. Paxton also contributed the layout of the Park Road circular estate. He is perhaps known best for his design of the Crystal Palace in London. Buxton Town Hall, designed by William Pollard, was completed in 1889.

=== Other architecture ===
Buxton Opera House, designed by Frank Matcham in 1903, is the highest opera-house site in the country. Matcham, a theatre architect, was responsible for several London theatres, including the London Palladium, the London Coliseum and the Hackney Empire. Opposite is an original Penfold octagonal post box. The opera house is attached to the Pavilion Gardens, Octagonal Hall (built in 1875) and the smaller Pavilion Arts Centre (previously The Hippodrome and the Playhouse Theatre.). Buxton Pavilion Gardens, designed by Edward Milner, contain 93,000 m2 of gardens and ponds and were opened in 1871. These form a Grade II* listed public park of Special Historic Interest. Milner&#x27;s design was a development of Joseph Paxton&#x27;s landscape for the Serpentine Walks in the 1830s.
The 122-room Palace Hotel, also designed by Currey and built in 1868, is a prominent feature of the Buxton skyline on the hill above the railway station.
The town is overlooked by Grin Low hill, 1,441 feet (439 m) above sea level, and by Grinlow Tower (locally also called Solomon&#x27;s Temple), a two-storey granite, crooked, crenelated folly built in 1834 by Solomon Mycock to provide work for local unemployed, and restored in 1996 after lengthy closure. In the other direction, on Corbar Hill, 1,433 feet (437 m) above sea level, is the tall wooden Corbar Cross. Originally given to the Catholic Church by the Duke of Devonshire in 1950 to mark Holy Year, it was replaced in the 1980s. In 2010, during a visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the UK, it was cut down as a protest against a long history of child abuse at the Catholic St Williams School in Market Weighton, Yorkshire. The Buxton ecumenical group Churches Together brought in several benefactors to replace the cross with a smaller one in May 2011.

Many pubs and inns in Buxton are listed buildings reflecting the historic character of the town, although many buildings have been demolished. Lost buildings of Buxton include grand spa hotels, the Midland Railway station, the Picture House cinema and Cavendish Girls&#x27; Grammar School.

== Culture ==

Cultural events include the annual Buxton Festival, festivals and performances at the Buxton Opera House, and shows running at other venues alongside them. Buxton Museum and Art Gallery offers year-round exhibitions.

=== Buxton Festival ===
Buxton Festival, founded in 1979, is an opera and arts event held in July at the Opera House and other venues. It includes some literary events in the mornings, concerts and recitals in the afternoon, and operas, many rarely performed, in the evenings. The quality of the opera programme has improved in recent years, after decades when, according to critic Rupert Christiansen, the festival featured &quot;work of such mediocre quality that I just longed for someone to put it out of its misery.&quot; Running alongside is the Buxton Festival Fringe, known as a warm-up for the Edinburgh Fringe. The Buxton Fringe features drama, music, dance, comedy, poetry, art exhibitions and films around the town. In 2018, 181 entrants signed up and comedy and theatre categories were at their largest.

=== Other festivals ===
The week-long &quot;Four Four Time&quot; music festival in February brings a variety of rock, pop, folk, blues, jazz and world music. The International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival, a three-week theatre event from the end of July through the first half of August, was held in Buxton from 1994 to 2013; it moved to Harrogate in 2014 but returned to Buxton in 2023.

The Opera House offers a year-long programme of drama, concerts, comedy and other events. In September 2010, the Paxton Suite in the Pavilion Gardens reopened as the Pavilion Arts Centre after a £2.5 million reconstruction. Located behind the Opera House, it includes a 369-seat auditorium. The stage area can be converted into a separate 93-seat studio theatre.

Buxton Museum and Art Gallery holds local artefacts, geological and archaeological samples (including the William Boyd Dawkins collection) and 19th and 20th-century paintings, with work by Brangwyn, Chagall, Chahine and their contemporaries. There are also displays by local and regional artists and other events. The Pavilion Gardens hold regular arts, crafts, antiques and jewellery fairs.

Buxton&#x27;s Well Dressing Festival in the week up to the second Saturday in July has been running in its current form since 1840, to mark the provision of fresh water to the high point of the town&#x27;s marketplace. As well as the dressing of the wells, it includes a carnival procession and a funfair on the marketplace. Well dressing is an ancient custom unique to the Peak District and Derbyshire and thought to date back to Roman and Celtic times, when communities would dress wells to give thanks for supplies of fresh water.

== Economy ==
Buxton&#x27;s economy covers tourism, retail, quarrying, scientific research, light industry and mineral water bottling. The University of Derby is a noted employer. Surrounded by the Peak District National Park, it offers a range of cultural events; tourism is a major industry, with over a million visitors to Buxton each year. Buxton is the main centre for overnight accommodation in the Peak District, with over 64 per cent of the park&#x27;s visitor bed space.

The Buxton Mineral Water Company, owned by Nestlé, extracts and bottles mineral waters. The &quot;Buxton Advertiser&quot; appears weekly. Potters of Buxton is the town&#x27;s oldest department store, founded in 1860.

=== Quarrying ===
The Buxton lime industry has shaped the town&#x27;s development and landscape since its 17th-century beginnings. Buxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 quarry owners in 1891. BLF became part of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in 1926 and Buxton was the headquarters for I.C.I. Lime Division until the 1970s. Several limestone quarries lie close, including the &quot;Tunstead Superquarry&quot;, the largest producer of high-purity industrial limestone in Europe, employing 400. The quarrying sector also provides jobs in limestone processing and distribution. Other industrial employers include the Health &amp; Safety Laboratory, which engages in health and safety research and incident investigations and maintains over 350 staff locally.

== Education ==
The town hosts a University of Derby campus at the site of the former Devonshire Royal Hospital, as well as the Buxton &amp; Leek College formed by the August 2012 merger of the university with Leek College.

Secondary schools include Buxton Community School, at the former College Road site of Buxton College, and St. Thomas More Catholic School. Others include Buxton Junior School, St Anne&#x27;s Catholic Primary, the greatest: Harper Hill School with excellent teachers, Buxton Infant School, John Duncan School, Fairfield Infant &amp; Nursery, Burbage Primary, Dove Holes CE Primary, Fairfield Endowed Junior, Peak Dale Primary, Leek College, Old Sams Farm Independent School, Hollinsclough CE Primary, Flash CE Primary, Earl Sterndale CE Primary, Peak Forest CE Primary and Combs Infant School.

== Sport and civic organisations ==

Above the town are two small speedway stadiums. Buxton Raceway (formerly High Edge Raceway), off the A53 Buxton to Leek road, is a motor sports circuit set up in 1974, hosting banger and stock car racing, as well as drifting events. It was home to the speedway team Buxton High Edge Hitmen in the mid-1990s before the team moved to a custom-built track to the north of the original one. The original track at High Edge Raceway was among the longest and trickiest in the UK. The new track is more conventional, and has been improved a few times. Buxton have been competitors in the Conference League. Buxton Raceway was due to hold a floodlit 2019 BriSCA Formula 2 World Final.

Buxton&#x27;s football club, Buxton F.C., plays at Silverlands and Buxton Cricket Club at the Park Road ground. Other team clubs are Buxton Rugby Union and Buxton Hockey Club. There are also four Hope Valley League football clubs: Buxton Town, Peak Dale and Buxton Christians play at the Fairfield Centre and Blazing Rag at the Kents Bank Recreation Ground.

Buxton has two 18-hole golf courses. Cavendish Golf Club ranked among the top 100 in England. It was designed by the renowned Alister MacKenzie and dates from 1925. At Fairfield is Buxton &amp; High Peak Golf Club. Founded in 1887 on the site of Buxton Racecourse, it is the oldest in Derbyshire.
The hillside round Solomon&#x27;s Temple is a popular local bouldering venue with many small outcrops giving problems mainly in the lower grades. These are described in the 2003 guidebook &quot;High over Buxton: A Boulderer&#x27;s Guide&quot;. Hoffman Quarry at Harpur Hill, sitting prominently above Buxton, is a local venue for sport climbing.

Youth groups include the Kaleidoscope Youth Theatre at the Pavilion Arts Centre, Buxton Squadron Air Cadets, Derbyshire Army Cadet Force and the Sea Cadet Corps, in addition to units of the Scouts &amp; Guide Association.

Buxton has three Masonic Lodges and a Royal Arch Chapter, which meets at the Masonic Hall, George Street. Phoenix Lodge of Saint Ann No. 1235 was consecrated in 1865, Buxton Lodge No. 1688 in 1877, and High Peak Lodge No. 1952 in 1881. The Royal Arch Chapter is attached to Phoenix Lodge of Saint Ann, and bears the same name and number, it being consecrated in 1872.

== Media ==
Regional TV news comes from Salford-based BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill and the local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby on 96.0FM and Greatest Hits Radio Derbyshire (High Peak) (formerly High Peak Radio) on 106.4FM. 

The &quot;Buxton Advertiser&quot; is the town’s weekly local newspaper.

== Transport ==
=== Railway ===
Buxton railway station has a generally half-hourly service to Stockport and Manchester Piccadilly along the Buxton line; trains are operated by Northern. The journey to Manchester takes just under an hour.

==== History ====
Buxton had three railway stations. Two were aligned to the LNWR: Buxton and Higher Buxton; the latter was next to Clifton Road and closed in 1951. The third was Buxton (Midland), situated next to the LNWR terminus. The Midland Railway station, closed on 6 March 1967, became the site for the Spring Gardens shopping centre. The trackbed of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midland Junction Railway has, in part, been used as a walking and cycling path called the Monsal Trail.

==== Heritage ====
Peak Rail, a preserved railway group, has restored the section from Rowsley South to Matlock; it has long-term ambitions to reopen it through to Buxton.

=== Buses ===
The town is served by bus routes that cross the Peak District National Park, including to the nearby towns of Whaley Bridge, Chapel-en-le-Frith, New Mills, Glossop and Ashbourne. 

The High Peak &quot;Transpeak&quot; service offers an hourly link southwards to Taddington, Bakewell, Matlock, Belper and Derby. The &quot;Skyline&quot; 199 route operates every half hour during the day to Manchester Airport, along the A6 through New Mills and Stockport. 

Other services link Buxton with Macclesfield, Leek, Stoke-on-Trent, Sheffield, Chesterfield and Meadowhall.

=== Air ===
The nearest airports are Manchester Airport (22 miles away), Liverpool John Lennon Airport (48 miles) and East Midlands Airport (52 miles).

<doc id="124262" wikidata="Q2109356" url="?curid=124262" title="Pender, Nebraska">
<text>Pender is a village in and the county seat of Thurston County, Nebraska, United States. On March 22, 2016, the United States Supreme Court resolved a disagreement as to whether Pender is located on the Omaha Indian Reservation, holding unanimously that &quot;the disputed land is within the reservation’s boundaries.&quot; The predominantly European-American population was 1,115 at the 2020 census.

==History==
European-American settlers founded the village in April 1885, naming it in honor of the Scottish politician and businessman Sir John Pender, a pioneer of the Transatlantic Cable. He founded what is now Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide, and was a director of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway.

==Current issues==
Tribal authorities of the federally recognized Omaha Nation assert that Pender is within the boundaries of the reservation as defined in its 1865 treaty with the United States. However, a Nebraska state court held in 1999 that the western boundary was a railroad right-of-way east of Pender, because of Omaha land sales to white farmers over the decades. The tribe&#x27;s response is that the state does not have the power to redefine the boundary set by the Omaha treaty with the US government in 1865.

The boundary and jurisdiction issues have received recent testing related to traffic control and liquor sales. Seeking to gain revenue from &quot;nuisance&quot; businesses, the Omaha in 2006 passed a law establishing the requirement for liquor merchants to pay the tribe license fees and a 10% sales tax to operate within the reservation. It notified the seven liquor stores in Pender, as well as those in Rosalie, and Walthill, Nebraska, all within reservation boundaries, that as of January 1, 2007, they would have to pay the Omaha Tribe licensing fees and a 10 percent tax on sales in order to continue to operate within the reservation. Ben Thompson, an Omaha attorney who represents the tribe, said that it had the legal right to establish such laws within the reservation. The executive director of the Nebraska State Liquor Commission said that he would consult with the state attorney general on the issue.
In April 2007, liquor merchants in Pender (later joined by the village) filed a federal lawsuit challenging the tribe&#x27;s authority to demand the liquor taxes, based on their contention that Pender was outside the reservation boundaries. In October 2007 the US District Court ordered the parties first to take their challenge to the Omaha Tribal Courts, as part of the &quot;tribal exhaustion doctrine&quot; established by federal precedent, and denied the plaintiffs&#x27; request for dismissal. Judge Richard Kopf said he may not be bound by the tribal court, but wanted to hear their opinion. He required the parties to report back to him regularly until a ruling was made by the Omaha Tribal Courts. While the case was pending, the judge ordered a temporary stay on the merchants&#x27; paying the liquor sales tax to the Omaha Tribe.

In January 2012, the plaintiffs in &quot;Pender v. Omaha Tribe&quot; filed a request with the Omaha Tribal Courts for a summary judgment due to the length of time the case had taken. The defendants requested that no hearing be held before June 2012. The plaintiffs had submitted a detailed report to them by an expert witness on transactions related to Pender and the western boundary. In 2008 the village had voted for a five-year, 1% sales tax to finance its lawsuit related to the boundary and liquor tax issues, as well as to promote economic development in the town.

On March 22, 2016, the Supreme Court unanimously held that Pender was within the boundaries of the Omaha Indian reservation.

<doc id="124282" wikidata="Q2387130" url="?curid=124282" title="North Loup, Nebraska">
<text>North Loup is a village in North Loup Township, Valley County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 254 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1871, a party of Seventh Day Baptists from Wisconsin explored Valley County for settlement sites. In May 1872, they established a community near what is now North Loup. A post office and general store were established in 1873. In 1877, the town of North Loup was formally organized. The name was taken from the North Loup River, in whose valley the village lies.

In 1880, the Union Pacific Railroad completed a branch line from Grand Island to St. Paul, shortening the distance from the Valley County settlements to rail transport. In the following year, North Loup and Ord voted to issue $9,000 worth of bonds to help subsidize the railroad&#x27;s extension through the two towns. The rail connection from St. Paul to North Loup was completed in 1882.

The arrival of the railroad prompted a boom in North Loup, which lasted for some four years. In the course of a single year, the village&#x27;s population doubled, to two hundred residents. The boom ended in 1886, when the railway line was finally completed to the county seat of Ord.

From about 1877 to 1890, the Loup valley enjoyed a series of wet years that attracted a wave of settlers, who homesteaded even marginal agricultural land. In 1890, this ended with a series of drought years, lasting until about 1896. During this time, the valley&#x27;s farmers experimented with alternative crops, among them winter wheat and alfalfa. In the North Loup valley, one such crop was popcorn. The experiment was successful; in 1901, North Loup celebrated its first &quot;Popcorn Days&quot; celebration, which continues to be held every August.

The village grew rapidly from about 1900 to 1920. By 1915, there were over 600 residents. Growth continued, albeit very slowly, in the 1920s; the maximum population of 643 was reached in 1930. After World War II, the population declined; in 1959, the village was no longer able to support its own school district, which was merged with that of Scotia, in neighboring Greeley County.

===2010 flood===
On June 12, 2010, the privately owned Bredthauer Dam, located upstream from North Loup on Mira Creek, broke due to heavy rain, flooding rural Valley County. Major flooding occurred in North Loup, with water &quot;eight inches deep and running down Main Street.&quot; The village was evacuated for the duration of the flood.
