Before European settlement, the area that became Ramsey was occupied by the Lenape Native Americans in the United States.

The most noteworthy local historical site is the Old Stone House, which is, as its name describes, both old and constructed of stone, though its construction materials in the early 1700s also included hog&#x27;s hair. It was originally a Dutch farmhouse and served as a tavern during the Revolutionary War. Legend has it that Aaron Burr slaked his thirst at this site, on his way to courting the woman who would become his wife in Ho-Ho-Kus. The structure opened as a historic site in 1960 with a display of antique pitchers.

<text>Ridgefield is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 11,501, an increase of 469 (+4.3%) from the 2010 census count of 11,032, which in turn reflected an increase of 202 (+1.9%) from the 10,830 counted in the 2000 census.

Ridgefield was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 26, 1892, from portions of Ridgefield Township. The borough was named for the area&#x27;s terrain.

==History==
At the time of European colonization, the area was home to the Hackensack tribe of the Lenape Native Americans, who maintained a large settlement to the north on Overpeck Creek. Their name is an exonym taken from the territory and is translated as &quot;place of stony ground&quot; which describes the diminishing Hudson Palisades as they descend into the Meadowlands becoming the &quot;ridgefield&quot; that is part of Hackensack River flood plain.

In 1642, Myndert Myndertsen received a patroonship as part of the New Netherland colony for much the land in the Hackensack and Passaic valleys. He called his settlement Achter Kol, or &quot;rear mountain pass&quot;, which refers to its accessibility to the interior behind the Palisades. Originally spared in the conflicts that begin with the Pavonia Massacre, the nascent colony was later abandoned. In 1655, Oratam, sachem of the Hackensack, deeded a large tract nearby to Sara Kiersted, who had learned the native language and was instrumental in negotiations between Native Americans and the settlers. In 1668, much of the land between Overpeck Creek and the Hudson River was purchased by Samuel Edsall, and soon became known as the English Neighborhood, despite the fact most of the settlers were of Dutch and Huguenot origin.

The opening of the West Shore Railroad and Erie Railroad&#x27;s Northern Branch in the mid 19th century brought suburbanization to the region, and in Ridgefield, significant industry and manufacturing. Grantwood was an artist&#x27;s colony established in 1913 by Man Ray, Alfred Kreymborg and Samuel Halpert and became known as the &quot;Others&quot; group of artists. The colony consisted of a number of clapboard shacks on a bluff. To this day the names of the streets in this part of the town—Sketch Place, Studio Road and Art Lane—pay homage to Grantwood&#x27;s history. Kreymborg moved to Ridgefield and launched &quot;&quot; with Skipwith Cannell, Wallace Stevens, and William Carlos Williams in 1915.

The initial of the New Jersey Turnpike were completed in 1952, with the original northern terminus at an interchange connecting to Route 46 in Ridgefield. An additional four-mile stretch of road connecting the Turnpike from Ridgefield to Interstate 80 in Teaneck and from there to the George Washington Bridge was completed in 1964. The western spur was added in the 1970s, with its two spurs re-connecting in the western side of the borough.

In the 1970s, the area came under the auspices of the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission, meant to set parameters and balance development in the ecologically sensitive region. Some parts of the low-lying areas, including Skeetkill Creek Marsh, have been set apart as nature reserves and extension of system that connects to the Overpeck Reserve and Overpeck County Park.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.87 square miles (7.43 km2), including 2.54 square miles (6.59 km2) of land and 0.33 square miles (0.85 km2) of water (11.39%).

The borough shares borders with Carlstadt, Cliffside Park, Fairview, Fort Lee, Little Ferry, Palisades Park, Ridgefield Park and South Hackensack in Bergen County; and North Bergen in Hudson County.

The borough is informally divided into three sections based on the geographical contour of the land. The first section is known as Ridgefield, and lies partly in the valley on both the east and west sides and partly on the first hill. The second section is known as Morsemere, and is located in the northern part of the borough. The third section is Ridgefield Heights, on the second hill at the extreme eastern part of the borough, running north and south.

Undercliff Junction is an unincorporated community located within Ridgefield.. Morsemere, which includes the southernmost part of Palisade Park, was named by a real estate development company in honor of Samuel F. B. Morse, inventor of the telegraph and Morse code. During the middle of the 19th century, Morse owned vast tracts of land in the borough. Ridgefield&#x27;s telephone exchange was Morsemere 6 until dial service arrived in the mid-1950s. Grantwood straddles Cliffside Park.

==Government==

===Local government===

Ridgefield is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Ridgefield is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Ridgefield Borough is Democrat Hugo Jimenez, who was appointed to serve an unexpired term of office ending on December 31, 2023. Members of the Ridgefield Borough Council are Council President Russell A. Castelli (D, 2023), Craig Dorsett (D, 2024), Hugo Jimenez (D, 2025), James V. Kontolios (D, 2025), Lauren Larkin (D, 2023) and Yongki Colin Ryu (D, 2024; appointed to serve an unexpired term).

Hugo Jimenez was appointed as mayor to fill the unexpired seat of Anthony R. Suarez expiring in December 2023 that became vacant when he took a seat as a judge. Joanna Leigh Congalton-Hali was appointed to fill the council seat Jimenez had held expiring in December 2025.

In January 2023, the borough council selected Yongki Colin Ryu to fill the seat expiring in December 2024 that had been held by Ray Penabad until he resigned from office; Ryu will serve on an interim basis until the November 2023 general election, when voters will select a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.

In June 2018, the borough council selected Lauren Larkin from a list of three candidates to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that became vacant following the resignation of Javier Acosta. Larkin served on an interim basis until the November 2018 general election, when she was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

In July 2009, Mayor Suarez was one of 44 people arrested across the state as part of Operation Bid Rig, a joint investigation into political corruption and money laundering. Suarez was charged with accepting a $10,000 cash bribe for assistance in arranging approvals to develop properties in Ridgefield. In a special election in August 2010, an effort to recall Suarez failed by a 38-vote margin. He was acquitted on all charges in October 2010.

As of the 2020 United States census, the village&#x27;s population was 25,979, an increase of 1,021 (+4.1%) from the 2010 census count of 24,958, which in turn reflected an increase of 22 (+0.1%) from 24,936 in the 2000 census.

Based on data from the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, it had a per-capita income of $67,560, 31st in the state. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, it had a median household income of $162,011, ranked 7th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

Ridgewood was ranked 26th in &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; in 2011.

==History==
In 1700, Johannes Van Emburgh built the first home in Ridgewood, having purchased a property in 1698.

The Village of Ridgewood was created on November 20, 1894, with the same boundaries as Ridgewood Township, also in Bergen County. The Village became the municipal government while the Township remained a school district. In 1902, the village added portions of Orvil Township, which were returned to Orvil Township in 1915. In 1925, Ridgewood Village acquired area from Franklin Township (remainder now dissolved as Wyckoff). On February 9, 1971, Ridgewood acquired area from Washington Township. On May 28, 1974, it acquired area from Ho-Ho-Kus. The name of the village derives from the characteristics of its terrain.

In 2014, former Ridgewood Public Works Inspector Thomas Rica was convicted of stealing over $460,000 in coins collected from the village&#x27;s parking meters. Rica was ordered to pay the entire amount back to the village and was permanently barred from seeking public employment in the state of New Jersey.

==Government==

===Local government===
Ridgewood is governed within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under Council-Manager plan B, as implemented on July 1, 1970, by direct petition. The village is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. The governing body is comprised of five council members who are responsible to hire and oversee a professional village manager who has full executive power for all departments. The government consists of five council members, with all positions elected at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve four-year terms on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election in even-numbered years on the second Tuesday in November. At a reorganization meeting held in January after newly elected council members take office, the council chooses a mayor and deputy mayor from among its members for two-year terms, with the mayor presiding over council meetings, but without any executive authority. The village council appoints a village manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the village, to handle personnel, citizen inquiries and complaints, and to handle the administrative duties of the village. The village council passes local laws, makes appointments to various boards and committees, and awards various contracts for purchases of goods and services used by the village. They also review, amend, and adopt the annual budget for the Village prepared by the Village Manager and Chief Financial Officer.

, members of the Ridgewood Village Council are Mayor Paul Vagianos (term on council ends December 31, 2026; term as mayor ends 2024), Deputy Mayor Pamela Perron (2024), Lorraine Reynolds (2024), Evan Weitz (2026) and Siobhan Winograd (2026).

In August 2021, councilmember Bernadette Walsh resigned from the seat expiring in December 2024, which was left temporarily vacant. In the November 2021 general election, Paul Vagianos was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

In the November 2020 general election, voters approved by a 59%-41% margin a referendum that would move school and municipal elections (which had been held in April and May respectively) so that they were included as part of the November general election. The supporters of the initiative argued that the shift would &quot;save money, improve turnout and improve security at schools where elections are held&quot;. The village council challenged the results of the referendum, but the village lost in Superior Court and had the ruling affirmed on appeal in March 2021, with the judge ruling that the village clerk had acted &quot;improperly and unlawfully&quot; in seeking to block the referendum.

Ridgewood is one of only four municipalities in New Jersey with the village type of government, joining Loch Arbour, Ridgefield Park and South Orange.

==Government==

===Local government===
River Edge is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by River Edge is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of the Borough of River Edge is Democrat Thomas R. Papaleo, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. The members of the Borough Council are Council President Lissa Montisano-Koen (D, 2025), Barry Benson (D, 2025), Priti Dhariwal (D, 2027), David Glass (D, 2026), Indira Kinsella (D, 2026) and Klodiana Malellari (D, 2027).

In January 2020, the borough council selected Indira Kinsella from three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that had been held by Thomas Papaleo until he resigned to take office as mayor.

In February 2016, the borough council selected Mary Davis from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that was vacated by Edward Mignone when he took office as mayor.

In October 2015, council member Anthony Cappola resigned from office and left the race for an Assembly seat in the 38th Legislative District, following disclosures that he had written and published a 2003 book titled &quot;Outrageous&quot; that was described as &quot;full of racial slurs, rants and stereotypes&quot;.

<text>River Vale is a township in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. River Vale is the easternmost municipality in an area of the county referred to as the Pascack Valley. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 9,909, an increase of 250 (+2.6%) from the 2010 census count of 9,659, which in turn reflected an increase of 210 (+2.2%) from the 9,449 counted in the 2000 census. The township was ranked #29 on the 100 Best Places to Live 2007 survey published by CNN/&quot;Money&quot; magazine.

River Vale was formed as a township on April 30, 1906, from portions of both Hillsdale Township (now Hillsdale Borough) and Washington Township. The township was named for its location along the Hackensack River.

On January 5, 1904, the temperature in River Vale fell to , the lowest temperature ever recorded in New Jersey.

==History==
The earliest settlers of what would become River Vale were the Lenape Native Americans.

Before 1841, present-day River Vale was part of Harrington Township. It used to be known as the &quot;Over Kill Neighborhood&quot; or just &quot;Over Kill&quot;—it being over the kill (Hackensack River) from Tappan. Its southern part, known as Eastwood (named in contrast to Westwood), became an independent borough in 1894, but was dissolved and re-absorbed into Washington Township in 1896.

River Vale was incorporated as a township in 1906, formed from portions of both Hillsdale and Washington Township. On July 15, 1929, part of River Vale was ceded to Park Ridge. On May 20, 1959, territory was acquired from Montvale.

In 1967, a mass grave site was discovered in River Vale from an event in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War, the Baylor Massacre. This became widely known due to a February 1968 report to the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders, &quot;1778 – The Massacre of Baylor&#x27;s Dragoons.&quot; The burial site was made into a county park that was dedicated on October 15, 1972.

On July 28, 1994, the residents of River Vale voted to recall Mayor Walter Jones, Councilwoman Patricia Geier and Councilman Bernard Salmon, following a battle between residents and the mayor and some council members over the mayor&#x27;s plan to merge River Vale&#x27;s 9-1-1 center to a regional dispatch center located in Park Ridge.

A River Vale resident, Henry Hoffman, directed the scrapping of in Kearny from 1958 to 1960. Following Hoffman&#x27;s death in 1965, the stern plate of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was placed on a Little League baseball field as a memorial. The field was later named Hoffman Field. On October 2, 2000, the stern plate was moved to the township&#x27;s Veterans&#x27; Memorial Park.

In March 2004, the township became the first municipality in the state to be placed on probation by the Municipal Excess Liability Joint Insurance Fund, a fund that covers legal expenses of member municipalities and government agencies. The issue was due to the number and scope of legal cases against the township, its employees and its governance, plus what David Grub, chief executive of the fund, called &quot;a general environment of personal attack&quot;. The fund urged the township to update employment practices and better train managers to avoid liabilities. As a result of these issues, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the township &quot;small but litigious&quot;.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 4.31 square miles (11.17 km2), including 4.07 square miles (10.54 km2) of land and 0.24 square miles (0.63 km2) of water (5.64%).

The township is bordered by Montvale to the northwest, Park Ridge, Woodcliff Lake (a very small section) and Hillsdale to the west, Westwood to the southwest, a small section bordering Emerson to the south, Harrington Park to the southeast, Old Tappan to the east, and Pearl River, New York to the north.

Its borders are defined by the Hackensack River to the east, which was dammed to form Lake Tappan, and Pascack Brook to the south. The northern border is defined by the New York-New Jersey state border. The western border has several sections, including a section defined by an unnamed creek and a section defined by Cedar Lane.

The southern portion of the township lies between the Hackensack River and Pascack Brook, and is relatively flat. The northern portion slopes down from rolling hills in the west into Lake Tappan to the east. Much of the land is developed as suburban single-family residences, but there remain some undeveloped areas. The undeveloped areas are mostly wooded and are south and west of Lake Tappan, following the Cherry Brook and the Hackensack River watershed. In 1996, plans to develop watershed land received resistance from the community. In the southwest of the township, the Pascack Brook County Park also preserves a wooded area. There are three golf courses in the township, two 18-hole public courses, and a private 18-hole course.

There is a small commercial district surrounding the intersection of Rivervale Road and Westwood Avenue in the southern portion of the township.

The Captain William Tyson House, which was constructed by a wealthy 19th century ship owner from New York City, is a historic home constructed in the mid-1860s and stands as one of the few remaining uses of the late-19th century Italianate architectural style in Bergen County. One of Rochelle Park&#x27;s oldest remaining structures, it was acquired by the township in 2015 for $600,000. Groups of residents have opposed the municipal expenditure of funds towards the acquisition and restoration of the 150-year-old building. The State Historic Preservation Office issued an opinion in 2002 indicating that the structure would be eligible for inclusion on the New Jersey register and the National Register of Historic Places; a Certification of Eligibility for the property was issued in 2015 that represents the next step towards inclusion on the state and national registers.

<text>Saddle Brook is a township in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 14,294, an increase of 635 (+4.6%) from the 2010 census count of 13,659, which in turn reflected an increase of 504 (+3.8%) from the 13,155 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==

Before European settlement, the earliest people in the area were the Lenape Native Americans.

Saddle River Township was created on March 20, 1716, consisting of all of the territory in Bergen County west of the Saddle River, making it one of the oldest municipalities in Bergen County, within the area that had been known as New Barbadoes Township, which itself had been set off from Essex County and added to Bergen County in 1710. It was incorporated on February 21, 1798, by the Township Act of 1798 as one of the initial group of 104 townships incorporated in New Jersey. The historic name of the township was from the Saddle River, a tributary of the Passaic River, which in turn was named for a stream and valley in Saddell, Argyll, Scotland. It was bounded on the north by Ridgewood, south by Lodi, east by the Saddle River and west by the Passaic River. In 1724, the Township formally seceded from New Barbadoes.

After its formation in 1716, Saddle River Township was split up in 1772 by royal decree, with the northernmost half becoming Franklin Township, named after the last royal governor of New Jersey, William Franklin, son of Benjamin Franklin. Pompton Township was established in 1797 from parts of both Franklin and Saddle River Townships west of the Ramapo River, leaving sections of both townships disconnected to the west of Pompton Township. West Milford Township was formed from the discontinuous, western sections of both Franklin and Saddle River townships in 1834. Saddle Brook was among the initial group of 104 municipalities formally incorporated under the Township Act of 1798.

In the initial wave of &quot;Boroughitis&quot; in which 26 new boroughs were created in 1894 alone and two more in 1895, Glen Rock (on September 14, 1894) and Lodi (December 22, 1894) split off from Saddle River Township, followed shortly thereafter by Wallington (January 2, 1895). Garfield (March 15, 1898), East Paterson (April 18, 1916; renamed to Elmwood Park, effective January 1, 1973) and Fair Lawn (April 5, 1924) subsequently split off.

Saddle Brook adopted its current name on November 8, 1955, replacing Saddle River Township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 2.76 square miles (7.14 km2), including 2.69 square miles (6.97 km2) of land and 0.06 square miles (0.17 km2) of water (2.32%).

The township is one of 71 (of the 564) municipalities statewide that use this form of government. The township&#x27;s governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the five-member Township Council. Members of the Township Council are elected at-large in partisan elections to four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either two seats (plus the mayoral seat) or three seats up for election in even-numbered years as part of the November general election.

, the Mayor of Saddle Brook is Democrat Robert D. White, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Township Council are Todd J. Accomando (D, 2026), Andrew M. Cimiluca (D, 2024), David Gierek (D, 2024), Florence Mazzer (D, 2024) and Sarah A. Sanchez (D, 2026).

In June 2017, David Gierek was chosen to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that had been held by Joseph Camilleri until he resigned from office under the terms of an anti-nepotism ordinance, after his son was under consideration for hire by the township as a police officer; Gierek served on an interim basis until the November 2017 general election, when voters elected Gierek to serve the balance of the term of office.

<text>Saddle River is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a suburb of New York City, located just over northwest of Manhattan. The town is known for its natural fields, farmland, horse farms, forests, and rivers, and has a bucolic atmosphere, due in part to a minimum zoning requirement of for homes. The borough contains both stately historic homes and estates, as well as newer mansions. It offers many spacious properties in a countryside-like setting, while also having proximity to New York City.

Saddle River is one of the highest-income small municipalities in the United States and was ranked 9th in New Jersey in per capita income as of the 2010 Census. Saddle River was ranked among the Top 100 in Forbes Most Expensive Zip Codes in America in 2010. In 1989, Saddle River was ranked the richest suburb in the nation among those with 2,500 or more people (based on per capita income). The town has been home to notable residents including former US Presidents, celebrities, athletes, and businessmen (See Notable people list).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described Saddle River as &quot;a place where one can still keep horses—one per acre—see a deer, listen to the birds, and catch a fish in the trout stream that gives the town its name.&quot;

As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 3,372, an increase of 220 (+7.0%) from the 2010 census count of 3,152, which in turn reflected a decline of 49 (−1.5%) from the 3,201 counted in the 2000 census.

Saddle River is a dry town, where alcohol cannot be sold.

==History==

European settlement of the area that is now Saddle River traces back to 1675, when the Lenape Native Americans sold a stretch of land along the Saddle River to Albert Zabriskie. Saddle River was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 22, 1894, from portions of Orvil Township, based on the results of a referendum held three days earlier. The borough was formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. Saddle River&#x27;s referendum passed on November 19, one day before the referendum passed for the formation of the neighboring borough of Upper Saddle River. An additional portion of Orvil Township was annexed in 1903.

The borough is named after the Saddle River, which flows through the borough and is a tributary of the Passaic River, which in turn was named for a stream and valley in Saddell, Argyll, Scotland.

==Government==

===Local government===

Saddle River is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, who are all elected on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Saddle River is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council. The mayor serves as chief executive officer, and is an ex-officio member of all municipal committees and is the approving authority in the Borough of Saddle River. Mayoral appointments to the various boards and committees in the borough are subject to confirmation by the borough council. Borough council members serve on various operating committees and function in a liaison capacity to provide information and direction to the entire governing body.

, the mayor is Republican Albert J. &quot;Al&quot; Kurpis, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Saddle River Borough Council are Council President David B. Hekemian (R, 2025), Duncan B. Carpenter (R, 2025), Christopher DiGirolamo (R, 2024), Jon Kurpis (R, 2026), Jeffrey S. Liva (R, 2024; elected to serve an unexpired term) and Ravi Sachdev (R, 2026).

In August 2022, the borough council appointed Jeffrey Liva to fill the seat expiring in December 2024 that had been held by Rosario Ruffino until he resigned from office earlier that month in protest over the cost of a park project. Liva served on an interim basis until the November 2022 general election, when he was elected to serve the remainder of the term of office.

John Azzariti and Ravi Sachdev were sworn in to three-year terms by Mayor Albert Kurpis during a combined in-person/remote session in January 2021. Azzariti had been appointed to the council last July after Councilman John DeRosa resigned for professional reasons. However, Azzariti chose to run with Sachdev for two open three-year terms, seats previously held by Paul Schulstad—who resigned in March 2020—and Eric Jensen, who did not seek a new term. Christopher DiGirolamo was elected to serve the one year remaining on DeRosa&#x27;s term of office.

In March 2020, the borough council appointed Christopher T. DiGirolamo to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that was vacated by Paul Schulstad when he resigned from office earlier that month.

<text>South Hackensack is a township in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 2,701, an increase of 323 (+13.6%) from the 2010 census count of 2,378, which in turn reflected an increase of 129 (+5.7%) from the 2,249 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
South Hackensack was formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 15, 1935, replacing Lodi Township, based on the results of a referendum held November 5, 1935, which passed by a margin of 309 to 15. The township&#x27;s name derives from its location relative to Hackensack.

The territory that became South Hackensack was the &quot;last unattractive portion&quot; of Lodi Township that neighboring municipalities didn&#x27;t want as it was &quot;either rural areas or areas that the others did not want to include in their boundaries because they didn&#x27;t want to pave the roads there or school the children&quot; according to Kevin Wright, a local historian. The state government has occasionally proposed the merger of South Hackesack into its neighboring municipalities, however, there is very little desire for such a merger within the township&#x27;s residents.

On November 15, 2024 Representative Josh Gottheimer announced that he would be running for governor of New Jersey from South Hackensack&#x27;s Runway Diner.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 0.75 square miles (1.94 km2), including 0.72 square miles (1.86 km2) of land and 0.03 square miles (0.08 km2) of water (4.27%).

After several boroughs were formed within the limits of Lodi Township, what remains as South Hackensack is divided into three noncontiguous sections. The northeastern, primary residential section is adjacent to Hackensack, Little Ferry and Teterboro. A small western portion, known as Garfield Park, lies in between Garfield, Lodi, Wallington and Wood-Ridge, while a southern sliver containing only industrial properties lies in the Meadowlands between Carlstadt, Moonachie, and Ridgefield.

Along with other municipalities in the Bergen County area, South Hackensack is a suburb of New York City.

<doc id="125011" wikidata="Q991387" url="?curid=125011" title="Teaneck, New Jersey">
<text>Teaneck () is a township in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a bedroom community in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 41,246, an increase of 1,470 (+3.7%) from the 2010 census count of 39,776, which in turn reflected an increase of 516 (+1.3%) from the 39,260 counted in the 2000 census. As of 2020, Teaneck was the second-most populous among the 70 municipalities in Bergen County, behind Hackensack, which had a population of 46,030.

Teaneck was created on February 19, 1895, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of Englewood Township and Ridgefield Township, both of which are now defunct (despite existing municipalities with similar names), along with portions of Bogota and Leonia. Independence followed the result of a referendum held on January 14, 1895, in which voters favored incorporation by a 46–7 margin. To address the concerns of Englewood Township&#x27;s leaders, the new municipality was formed as a township, rather than succumbing to the borough craze sweeping across Bergen County at the time. On May 3, 1921, and again on June 1, 1926, portions of what had been Teaneck were transferred to Overpeck Township.

Teaneck lies at the junction of Interstate 95 and the eastern terminus of Interstate 80. The township is bisected into north and south portions by Route 4 and east and west by the River Subdivision of CSX Transportation. Commercial development is concentrated in four main shopping areas, on Cedar Lane, Teaneck Road, DeGraw Avenue, and West Englewood Avenue and Queen Anne Road, more commonly known as &quot;The Plaza&quot;.

Teaneck&#x27;s location at the crossroads of river, road, train and other geographical features has made it a site of many momentous events across the centuries. After the American defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington, George Washington and the troops of the Continental Army retreated across New Jersey from the British Army, traveling through Teaneck and crossing the Hackensack River at New Bridge Landing, which has since been turned into a state park and historic site commemorating the events of 1776 and of early colonial life. In 1965, Teaneck voluntarily desegregated its public schools, after the Board of Education approved a plan to do so by a 7–2 vote on May 13, 1964. Teaneck has a diverse population, with large Jewish and African American communities, and growing numbers of Hispanic and Asian residents.

==History==
===Early history===
The origin and meaning of the name &quot;Teaneck&quot; is not known, but speculation is that it could come from various Dutch or English words, or it could be Native American in origin, meaning &quot;the woods&quot;. An alternative is from the Dutch &quot;Tiene Neck&quot; meaning &quot;neck where there are willows&quot; (from the Dutch &quot;tene&quot; meaning willow).

The earliest uses of the word &quot;Teaneck&quot; were in reference to a series of Lenni Lenape Native American camps near the ridge formed by what became Queen Anne Road. Chief Oratam was the leader of a settlement called &quot;Achikinhesacky&quot; that existed along Overpeck Creek in the area near what became Fycke Lane.

A neighborhood variously called East Hackensack or New Hackensack was established along a ridge on the east bank of the Hackensack River, site of a Native American trail that followed the river&#x27;s path along what is now River Road, with the earliest known buildings constructed dating back as far as 1704. Other early European settlements were established along what became Teaneck Road, which is the site of a number of Dutch stone houses that remain standing since their construction in the 1700s, several of which have been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

===Revolutionary War period===
During November 1776, General George Washington passed through Teaneck in the aftermath of the Battle of Fort Lee, as part of the hasty retreat of Colonial forces from Fort Lee on the Hudson River.

===Phelps Estate===

Subsequent development and house construction were focused along the perimeters of the township, with the central part of the community remaining a large property crisscrossed by of paved roads and trails that were constructed and improved by Phelps.

===Township formed===

The Township of Teaneck was established on February 19, 1895, and included portions of Englewood Township, Ridgefield Township and Bogota. Teaneck&#x27;s choice to incorporate as a township was unusual in an era of &quot;Boroughitis&quot;, in which a flood of new municipalities were being formed using the decentralized and locally controlled borough form of government. The other two municipalities formed in Bergen County in 1895 were both boroughs, in addition to the 26 boroughs that were formed in the county in 1894 alone.

In a referendum held on January 14, 1895, 46 of 53 voters approved incorporation as a borough. Citizens of Englewood Township challenged the creation of a borough, but accepted the new municipality as a township, given its more rural character. A bill supporting the creation of the Township of Teaneck was put through the New Jersey General Assembly on February 18, 1895, and the New Jersey Senate on the next day. New Jersey Governor George Werts signed the bill into law, and Teaneck was an independent municipality.

At its incorporation, Teaneck&#x27;s population was 811. William W. Bennett, overseer of the Phelps Estate, was selected as chairman of the first three-man Township Committee, which focused in its early years on &quot;construction of streets and street lamps (originally gaslights), trolley lines (along DeGraw Avenue), telephones and speeding traffic.&quot;

===Early 20th century===
The opening of the Phelps Estate in 1927 led to substantial population growth. The George Washington Bridge was completed in 1931, and its connection to Teaneck via Route 4 brought thousands of new home buyers. From 1920 and 1930, Teaneck&#x27;s population nearly quadrupled, from 4,192 to 16,513.

Rapid growth led to financial turmoil, and inefficiencies in the town government resulted in the adoption of a new nonpartisan Council-Manager form of government under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law in a referendum on September 16, 1930. A full-time Town Manager, Paul A. Volcker Sr. (the father of future Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul A. Volcker Jr.), was appointed to handle Teaneck&#x27;s day-to-day business affairs. During his 20-year term, from 1930 to 1950, Volcker implemented financial management practices and a development plan that included comprehensive zoning regulations, along with a civil service system for municipal employees and a professional fire department.

The New Jersey Supreme Court issued a ruling in 1942 upholding a Teaneck ordinance that had banned pinball machines on the grounds that they were gambling devices rather than a form of amusement.

===Post–World War II===
Teaneck was selected in 1949 from more than 10,000 communities as America&#x27;s model community, with the United States Army saying that the township was chosen because of its &quot;fine municipal spirit and the high quality of its governmental service.&quot; Photographs were taken and a film produced about life in Teaneck, which were shown in Occupied Japan and Austria as a part of the Army&#x27;s education program to show democracy in action.

In 1953, Fairleigh Dickinson College, then with 2,800 students based in Rutherford, New Jersey, merged with the 400-student Bergen Junior College, acquiring its campus in Teaneck, with the Bergen Junior College president saying that &quot;the Teaneck property lends itself to considerable expansion&quot;.

After World War II, there was a second major spurt of building and population growth. The African American population in the northeast corner of Teaneck grew substantially starting in the 1960s, accompanied by white flight triggered by blockbusting efforts of township real estate agencies. In 1965, after a struggle to address de facto segregation in housing and education, Teaneck became the first community in the nation where a white majority voluntarily voted for school integration, without a court order requiring the district to implement the change. The sequence of events was the subject of a book titled &quot;Triumph in a White Suburb&quot; written by township resident Reginald G. Damerell (New York: William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc., 1968).

As de facto racial segregation increased, so did tensions between residents of the northeast and members of the predominantly white male Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a teenager with a gun. After an initial confrontation near Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Phillip Pannell, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and had been shot in the back. Protest marches, some violent, ensued; most African Americans believed that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, while other residents insisted that Spath had been justified in his actions. Testimony at the trial claimed that Pannell was shot in the back, and that he was carrying a gun. A police officer testified to finding a modified starter&#x27;s pistol with eight cartridges in Pannell&#x27;s jacket pocket. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the community and inspired the 1995 book &quot;Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town&quot;, by Mike Kelly.

Teaneck, and the neighboring communities of Bergenfield and New Milford, has drawn a large number of Modern Orthodox Jews who have established at least fifteen synagogues and four yeshivas (three high schools and one for young men). It is the functional center of the northern New Jersey Orthodox community, with nearly twenty kosher shops (restaurants, bakeries and supermarkets). It is within ten minutes&#x27; driving time of Yeshiva University in New York City.

===Historic homes===

Several homes in Teaneck date back to the colonial era or the period subsequent to American Revolutionary War and have been preserved and survive to this day. Teaneck sites on the National Register of Historic Places and (other historic homes) include:

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 6.24 square miles (16.15 km2), including 6.04 square miles (15.65 km2) of land and 0.20 square miles (0.51 km2) of water (3.16%).

Teaneck is bordered by eight municipalities in Bergen County, including to the west by River Edge and Hackensack which lie across the Hackensack River, to the north by New Milford and Bergenfield, to the east by Englewood and Leonia, and to the south by Ridgefield Park and Bogota.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include New Bridge and West Englewood.

==Demographics==

English is the sole home language of 72.4% of residents. Over a quarter of residents speak other languages, including Spanish (14.5%), Tagalog (2.3%), Urdu (1.8%), Korean (1.0%), and Polish (1.0%).

A 2001 study under the Berman Jewish DataBank estimated the number of Jewish households in the 07666 ZIP code of Teaneck to comprise 16.5% of the total. In 2018, the number of Jewish residents in Teaneck was estimated to be about 15,000 out of a total population of 36,000-37,000. A large segment of this population in Teaneck and neighboring Bergenfield is comprised of Modern Orthodox Jews.

===Historical population===
After its founding as a township, Teaneck saw rapid growth in its population during the first half of the 20th century. As Teaneck changed from a sparsely populated rural area into a suburb, particularly after development of property that had been part of the Phelps Estate started in the late 1920s, Teaneck&#x27;s population grew rapidly, far outpacing the growth of Bergen County.

After World War II, the 1950 Census showed growth in Teaneck (33.6%) pacing Bergen County overall (31.6%). Starting in 1960, a substantial decline in the rate of growth compared to Bergen County occurred as Teaneck reached the limits of developable land, and the township neared its peak population. Population growth in the 1970 Census was small, but positive, with Teaneck reaching its historical maximum of 42,355. Absolute declines in population followed in both the 1980 (−7.9%) and 1990 (−3.0%) data. The 2000 Census showed recovery in Teaneck&#x27;s population to 39,260, though growth (3.8%) was smaller than in Bergen County overall (7.1%).

With almost no land left to develop for housing, Teaneck&#x27;s population is likely to remain stable for the foreseeable future. A reluctance to permit high-rise development as a means to increase population density also places a limit on growth. Changes in family size and the possibility of zoning changes to allow denser construction are some of the few influences that may affect population over time.

===Crime===
According to the FBI&#x27;s 2016 Uniform Crime Report, there were 497 crimes in the township in 2016 (vs. 490 in 2015), of which 72 were violent crimes (vs. 50 in 2015) and 425 non-violent crimes (440 in 2015). The 2016 total crime rate per thousand residents was 12.1 (vs. 12.0 in 2015). The violent crime rate per thousand residents for the State New Jersey was 2.2 and the non-violent crime rate 10.4.

Gang violence hit Teaneck in July 2006 with the death of Ricky Lee Smith Jr., a teenager shot outside a house party by a member of the Bloods gang who had attended the party. In June 2007, the Township Council approved the hiring of five additional officers after the Chief of Police had requested the addition of 14 new officers to Teaneck&#x27;s existing 98-member police force to establish a gang unit.

Teaneck has received attention in the media due to sexual crimes committed against minors by New Jersey educators. Joseph White, former principal of Teaneck High School, pleaded guilty to official child endangerment in June 2006 and was sentenced to one year in prison. White had been charged in 2002 with fondling a 17-year-old student and was subsequently acquitted. James Darden, an award-winning former eighth grade teacher at Thomas Jefferson Middle School, was charged with sexual assault and misconduct in June 2007. He pleaded guilty in December 2007 to a charge of aggravated sexual assault. In 2008, James Darden was sentenced to eight years in prison, after admitting to having a two-year sexual relationship with a student that started when she was 13. In 2018 another incident took place: A substitute teacher was charged with sexual assault. He was ordered to surrender his teacher&#x27;s license and was sentenced to probation.

The December 1975 murder of Jean Diggs and her four children has never been solved. Police reported in 1977 that they had been unable to identify a perpetrator after two years and thousands of hours spent investigating the crime.

A pair of killings hit Teaneck in 2010, with council watcher Joan Davis and software engineer Robert Cantor both killed in their homes, in cases that had not been solved in more than a year after the incidents. A conviction for the murder of Robert Cantor was made in 2015.

Based on a data analysis of 18 years, it is estimated that crime will continue to decline. In 2016, the city&#x27;s crime rate was 55.76% lower than the national average of violent crime and  28.3% lower than New Jersey&#x27;s crime rate. The crime rate in Teaneck Township was  57.79% lower than the national property crime average and  33.03% lower than the property crime rate in New Jersey.

Teaneck Cinemas had been the township&#x27;s lone movie theater, and had also hosted live performances on its stage by local performance groups, until it closed its doors in November 2012, with theater operator Majestic Entertainment citing costs that could run to as much as $500,000 to modernize the projection systems on all four screens to use digital technology rather than 35mm reels of film. New owner Matthew Latten signed a lease in April 2013 and undertook extensive renovations that included new seating, modern digital projection systems and digital signage. After hosting the Teaneck International Film Festival in November, the reopening of the renamed Teaneck Cinemas was delayed until December 2013, with added time needed to complete the work needed to add modern features and conveniences while retaining the Art Deco character of a theater first constructed in 1937. For a number of years, the theater was main venue for screenings for Hoboken International Film Festival. The Northeast Film Festival, also takes place at Teaneck Cinemas.

The Brooklyn Nets professional basketball team was founded as the New Jersey Americans in Teaneck for the 1967–1968 season, as charter members of the American Basketball Association. The team played their home games at the Teaneck Armory for that one season, and was scheduled to play a one-game playoff at the armory. However, the circus had been booked for the week, and the game was relocated to a court in Commack, New York that was unplayable, and the game had to be forfeited. After the one season in Teaneck, the team relocated to Long Island and was renamed the New York Nets. Following the Long Island run, the Nets moved back to New Jersey in 1977 to be named as the New Jersey Nets until 2012, when they moved back to New York and became the Brooklyn Nets.

==Government==
===Local government===

Teaneck is governed within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager form of government. The council-manager system was adopted by referendum in 1988. The council&#x27;s seven members are elected at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve staggered, four-year terms of office. Following a municipal election, the Township Council holds a Reorganization Meeting where the winners are sworn in, and the council elects a mayor and two deputy mayors from among its own members. Under the council-manager system, the mayor&#x27;s chief role is to preside over the council. The mayor (and deputy mayors) vote on all matters as regular members of the council, and the position is not an executive one. The mayor does, however, execute bonds, notes, contracts and written obligations of the Township and is empowered to perform marriages.
&lt;br&gt;The chief executive of the Township of Teaneck is the Township Manager, who is hired by the council and is present at meetings of the council but does not have voting power. The Manager implements Council policies, enforces ordinances and is responsible for appointing and directing department heads. The Township Manager is also responsible for preparing and submitting the budget to the council.

The Township Council serves as Teaneck&#x27;s governing body, setting policies and passing ordinances. It adopts an annual budget and approves contracts and agreements for services. The Council appoints the town officials, including the Manager, Clerk, Auditor, Attorney, Magistrate and Assessor. The Council appoints seven members of the Planning Board, the members of the Board of Adjustment, and all other statutory and advisory boards.

As of January 2023 the Township Council was comprised as follows:
As of January 2025, the Township Manager was Jacklyn Hashmat, who has been serving since 2024. 

Following its founding in 1895, Teaneck used the traditional township form of government, led by a three-member Township Committee (later expanded to five seats) elected on a partisan basis. On September 16, 1930, Teaneck residents voted to establish a non-partisan Council-Manager form of government under the terms of the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five members elected concurrently on an at-large basis. In 1962, the Council expanded to its current size of seven members and the position of Deputy Mayor was created. In 1987, a referendum to alter the form to a Faulkner Act Council-Manager form of government was approved, providing for staggered terms for the council. The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 565) statewide that use this form of government. 
&lt;br&gt;Until 2021, council elections took place in even years on the second Tuesday in May. Following a referendum that passed in 2021, the date of Township Council elections was moved to November to be held with the state-wide elections.

In May 2000, three women ran for Township Council, and all three, incumbent Jackie Kates and newcomers Marie Warnke and Deborah Veach, were elected. Kates, Warnke and Veach completed their four-year terms and then ran for re-election in May 2004. Jackie Kates and Deborah Veach were re-elected and became Mayor and Deputy Mayor, respectively. Ms. Veach resigned her position in October 2005 and was appointed to be the Township&#x27;s Municipal Prosecutor.

On May 13, 2008, the township voted to re-elect Monica Honis to the council (with 2,981 votes). Elnatan Rudolph (2,852) lost his bid for re-election, falling 38 votes behind his running mate. Barbara Toffler (leading the voting with 3,356 votes) and Mohammed Hameeduddin (2,890) were elected and took office on July 1, 2008, filling the seats left by Rudolph and former mayor Jackie Kates, who did not run for re-election.

In the 2010 municipal elections, Adam Gussen, Elie Katz and Lizette Parker were re-elected to office, with former councilmember Yitz Stern taking the seat vacated by former mayor Kevie Feit, who did not run for a second term. At its July 1, 2010, reorganization meeting the council selected Mohammed Hameeduddin to serve as mayor, making him one of the state&#x27;s first Muslim mayors, while Adam Gussen was chosen as deputy mayor.

In the May 2012 municipal election, Mohammed Hameeduddin won a second term in office (with 4,374 votes) and was the only incumbent to win re-election, with challengers Mark Schwartz (3,150) and Henry Pruitt (2,872) taking the seats of Barbara Toffler (2,526) and Monica Honis (2,238), who lost their bids for re-election and came in fourth and fifth respectively, while Alexander Rashin came in sixth (1,049).

In the May 2018 municipal election, Elie Katz won a sixth term in office (with 3,822 votes) and Gervonn Romney Rice, who was selected to replace Mayor Lizette Parker (after her death in 2016), won reelection (with 4,480 votes). Challengers Keith Kaplan (with 3,191 votes) and James Dunleavy (with 3,360 votes) defeated incumbent Alan Sohn (with 2,483 votes) and challengers Clara Williams (with 2,303 votes) and Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Powers (with 2,282 votes).

===Federal, state, and county representation===

Teaneck is in the 5th Congressional District and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s 37th state legislative district.

Prior to the 2010 Census, all of Teaneck had been part of the 9th Congressional District, a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections, making Teaneck one of 14 municipalities (and the only one in Bergen County) to be split across districts, down from the 29 that had been split after the 2000 Census. As part of the redistricting that took effect in 2013, 32,023 (about 80%) of Teaneck residents were placed in the new 5th District, with the remaining 7,753 residents (about 20%) mostly in areas of the township east of Teaneck Road and south of Bedford Avenue placed in the 9th District.

===Taxation===

The Tax Foundation determined that Bergen County had the third-highest median property tax burden in the nation ($8,708 vs. a New Jersey median of $6,579 and a national median of $1,917) and the fourth-highest level of property taxes as a percentage of median income (8.59% vs. 7.45% statewide and 3.03% nationally), based on an analysis of data from the 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau for all 792 counties in the United States with more than 20,000 residents. As of 2010, Teaneck&#x27;s effective tax rate of $2.492 per $100 of equalized value was the 12th-highest of the 70 municipalities in Bergen County, which had a countywide median effective rate of $2.115 per $100, ranging from a low of $.596 in Alpine to a high of $3.005 in Ridgefield Park.

, just under 55% of a Teaneck property owner&#x27;s real estate taxes goes to support the local school system, 36.7% goes to municipal taxes (including an open space tax) and the remaining 8.4% to cover county services (which also assesses an open space tax). In the decade from 2003 to 2013, municipal taxes had risen at an annual rate of just over 4.5% and school taxes by almost 2.8%, while the consumer price index for the New York–Northern New Jersey–Long Island area had gone up 2.6% during that time span.

The 2013 tax rate was set at $2.486 per $100 of assessed value (an overall increase of 3.7% from 2012), which includes school taxes of $1.365 (up almost 3.3%), municipal taxes of $0.871 (an increase of 5.8%), a library tax of $.031 (down 3.1%) and county taxes of $0.206 (down 0.5%), plus a municipal open space tax of $0.010 and a county open space tax of $0.003 (both unchanged). The owner of a median-valued home in Teaneck, assessed at $465,300, paid 2011 property taxes of $11,190, which would include $6,244 in school taxes, $3,992 in municipal taxes and $949 to the county (including open space levies).

During 2006, Teaneck underwent a revaluation of all privately owned real estate, as required periodically by the state. This revaluation adjusted property values to market prices, ensuring that taxes are equitably allocated. The average property in Teaneck was assessed at approximately $417,900, an increase of 132.1% from the prior year&#x27;s average. The new valuations took effect for the 2007 tax year. In the wake of the revaluation implemented in 2007, a wave of tax appeals hit the township, resulting in a loss of about $110 million in ratables and costs to the township of $2.2 million for the 2012 tax year. The township agreed to complete a revaluation by October 2014 that would go into effect in 2015, awarding a $710,000 contract to perform the necessary home visits and determine property values.

The Teaneck Public Schools had a Budgetary Per Pupil Cost of $18,417 in its 2012–2013 budget, 26.8% higher than the average of $14,519 budgeted that year by districts in the same grouping of grades and enrollment, ranked as the 101st highest among the 106 K–12 districts in the state with more than 3,500 students.

At the April 2006 school elections, voters rejected the proposed $84.8 million budget for the Teaneck Public Schools for the 2006–2007 school year by a 1,644 to 1,336 margin. Based on recommendations specified by the Township Council, the Board of Education approved $544,391 in cuts. The school budget was rejected again in 2009, with the Council cutting $1 million from the $94.8 million originally proposed. After the 2010 school budget failed, the Township Council removed $6.1 million from the $95 million budget proposed by the school district, zeroing out what would have been an 8.2% increase in the school tax levy. The school board eliminated 77 positions to meet the cuts approved by the council.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
, the township had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Bergen County, by the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

Teaneck is situated along a number of major transportation routes, including the New Jersey Turnpike (a portion of Interstate 95). It is known for being the Eastern endpoint of Interstate 80, which stretches west to San Francisco since the dedication of a segment in Salt Lake City on August 22, 1986, marking the completion of the first transcontinental portion of the Interstate Highway System. As the second-longest Interstate route, the highway stretches nearly coast-to-coast for , shorter than only Interstate 90. The easternmost of Interstate 80 runs from Bogota to the junction with Interstate 95.

NJ Route 4 traverses east–west through Teaneck, running from Hackensack to Englewood. Unlike all other municipalities situated along the highway, there is no commercial development or billboards, with the open space along the highway maintained by the Township Council&#x27;s Preserve the Greenbelt Committee. Route 4 narrows from three lanes in each direction on a section between Belle Avenue and Englewood, causing rush-hour traffic backups that may extend for miles. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) has discussed a series of proposed replacement projects for bridges over the highway, pending completion of feasibility studies and design work. While the township has indicated its willingness to cede space along the Greenbelt for a third lane, the lack of space for a shoulder may preclude the creation of a full three-lane route through Teaneck. In November 2013, NJDOT informed Teaneck officials that it had no plans to widen the highway, as the need to focus the limited funds available on replacing and repairing deteriorating bridges and infrastructure precluded the implementation of a widening project.

Interstate 95 heads north for through Teaneck from Ridgefield Park to Leonia. New Jersey&#x27;s other main trunk route, the Garden State Parkway, can be reached just a few miles west of Teaneck. Access to New York City is available for motorists by way of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee (via Route 4 or Interstate 95), or through the Lincoln Tunnel in Hudson County (via the NJ Turnpike) into Midtown Manhattan.

County roads in Teaneck include Teaneck Road, Queen Anne Road, River Road and Fort Lee Road. Cedar Lane, another county road, crosses the Hackensack River and connects to Hackensack over the Anderson Street Bridge.

===Public transportation===
NJ Transit bus service is available in Teaneck, with frequent service on Teaneck Road, Route 4 and Cedar Lane, and less-frequent service on other main streets. NJ Transit bus service is offered to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on the 155, 157, 165R, 167 and 168 routes; to the George Washington Bridge Bus Station in Upper Manhattan on the 171, 175, 178, 182 and 186 routes; and to other New Jersey communities served on the 83, 751, 753, 755, 756, 772 and 780 routes. Scheduled bus service is also available from Rockland Coaches to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, 11T/11AT from Stony Point, New York. Spanish Transportation and several other operators provide frequent jitney service along Route 4 between Paterson, New Jersey and the George Washington Bridge Bus Station.

While there is currently no passenger train operation in Teaneck, train service is available across the Hackensack River at the New Bridge Landing station in River Edge and at the Anderson Street station in Hackensack. NJTransit&#x27;s Pascack Valley Line runs north–south to Hoboken Terminal, with connections to the PATH train from the Hoboken PATH station, and with NJT connecting service to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan via the Secaucus Junction transfer station. At Hoboken Terminal, connections are also available to NY Waterway ferry service (to the World Financial Center and other destinations) and to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system (serving locations along the Hudson River in Hudson County).

Teaneck is split east and west by railroad tracks, which currently provide freight service by CSX Transportation. Until 1959, passenger train service was provided on these same tracks by the West Shore Railroad, with Teaneck stations at Cedar Lane and West Englewood Avenue. Commuter service was available from these stations, with 44 passenger trains operating daily to and from Weehawken, where Hudson River ferry service was available to New York City at 42nd Street and at the Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Train service from Teaneck was also available north to Albany, along the west shore of the river. Efforts are ongoing to restore some passenger train service on this line for commuters heading toward New York City, including extension of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service via the Northern Branch to Englewood or Tenafly.

Teaneck&#x27;s closest airport in New Jersey with scheduled passenger service is Newark Liberty International Airport, away (about 27 minutes) in Newark / Elizabeth. New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport is away in Flushing, Queens via the George Washington Bridge, an estimated 22 minutes in ideal conditions. John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens is and 34 minutes from Teaneck. Teterboro Airport offers general aviation service, and is a drive (about 13 minutes).

<text>Tenafly () is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 15,409, an increase of 921 (+6.4%) from the 2010 census count of 14,488, which in turn reflected an increase of 682 (+4.9%) from the 13,806 counted in the 2000 census. Tenafly is a suburb of New York City.

The borough has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Tenafly residents had a median household income of $153,381, ranked 13th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

Tenafly was incorporated as a borough on January 24, 1894, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of the now-defunct Palisades Township, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day. The borough was the first formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. Portions of Palisades Township were acquired based on legislation approved on April 8, 1897.

==History==
The first European settlers in Tenafly were Dutch immigrants, who began to populate the area during the late 17th century. The name &quot;Tenafly&quot; is of Dutch language origin. Some historical references cite a Dutch language connection to its location on or at &quot;a meadow.&quot; Other derivations cite the early-modern Dutch phrase &quot;Tiene Vly&quot; or &quot;Ten Swamps&quot; which was given by Dutch settlers in 1688.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 5.16 square miles (13.38 km2), including 4.59 square miles (11.88 km2) of land and 0.58 square miles (1.50 km2) of water (11.20%).

The borough borders the municipalities of Alpine, Bergenfield, Cresskill, Englewood and Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, as well as the Bronx in New York City across the Hudson River.

Tenafly&#x27;s street plan and overall development were largely determined by its hills and valleys. The eastern part of the borough is referred to as the &quot;East Hill&quot; for its higher elevation in relation to the rest of the borough. There, the terrain rises dramatically to the east of the downtown area, terminating at the New Jersey Palisades, overlooking the Hudson River. Nearby is the Tenafly Nature Center, located at 313 Hudson Avenue.

==Government==

This charter retains most aspects of the borough form of government, with the addition of initiative, referendum and recall features. The borough is one of 11 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use a state-granted special charter. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office and is eligible for re-election. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. As the legislative body, the borough council adopts ordinances and resolutions, decides on appropriations, approves appointments made by the mayor, determines policy and establishes the functions of the various departments of the local government. Each council member is chairperson of one of six standing committees. The mayor presides over council meetings, but only votes in case of a tie and can cast a veto which can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the council.

, the mayor of Tenafly is Democrat Mark Zinna, whose term ends on December 31, 2023. Members of the Tenafly Borough Council are Lauren M. Dayton (D, 2023), Jeffrey D. Grossman (D, 2023), Venugopal Menon (D, 2024), Adam Michaels (D, 2025), Julie O&#x27;Connor (D, 2024) and Daniel Park (D, 2025).

Tenafly was the only high school in New Jersey and one of 38 public high schools in the U.S. to receive the 2005 Blue Ribbon School Award.

The school was the third-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 328 schools statewide in &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 2012 cover story on the state&#x27;s &quot;Top Public High Schools&quot;, after also being ranked third in 2010 out of 322 schools listed.

=== Public transportation ===
Local and express bus service to and from New York City is available via NJ Transit bus route 166 to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.

Rockland Coaches provides services to the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Routes 9/9A/9T/9TA from Stony Point, New York, and the 20/20T routes from West Nyack, New York.
From the mid-1850s until September 1966, Tenafly was served by rail along the Northern Branch, originally to Pavonia Terminal and later to Hoboken Terminal. CSX now provides freight service along the line. The former Tenafly Station, currently a restaurant, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979; it is one of four surviving stations on the Northern Branch.

The Northern Branch Corridor Project, a proposal by New Jersey Transit to extend the Hudson Bergen Light Rail for nine stops and northward from its current terminus in North Bergen to two stations in Tenafly, the last of which would be a new terminus near the Cresskill town line, met with mixed reactions. Many residents and officials believed that the negative consequences for the borough in terms of traffic and noise outweighed the benefits. In November 2010, voters rejected the plan to re-establish a rail service to the town by a nearly 2–1 ratio in a non-binding referendum, with all of the borough council candidates opposing the restoration of commuter train service. There is continued resistance to New Jersey Transit&#x27;s preferred alternative as described in the plan&#x27;s December 2011 announcement. Despite local opposition, officials in Bergen County asked the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority to support the proposal. In 2013, New Jersey Transit announced that the line would end in Englewood, after Tenafly officials estimated that as much as $8 million in commercial property valuation would be lost and residents raised strong objections.

<text>Waldwick () is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 10,058, an increase of 433 (+4.5%) from the 2010 census count of 9,625, which in turn reflected an increase of three people (+0.0%) from the 9,622 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Originally inhabited during the pre-Columbian era by the Lenape Native American tribe, the region surrounding Waldwick was first explored by Europeans when a Dutch trading expedition landed near there in 1610. With the creation of the Nieuw Amsterdam colony in 1624, the present site of the borough became a Dutch possession along with the rest of northeastern New Jersey. During the period from 1624 to 1664 it was sparsely developed by Dutch settlers, mainly for agricultural purposes. With the annexation of Nieuw Amsterdam by the English in 1664 came a nearly instant increase in immigration to the region and the development of several settlements in and around the present borders of the borough.

In the mid-19th century, Waldwick and the surrounding area constituted a small settlement within Franklin Township, an area that encompassed much of northwestern Bergen County. The area&#x27;s population grew significantly after the Erie Railroad established a train station. On January 1, 1886, Orvil Township was formed from portions of Hohokus Township and Washington Township. The &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon that swept through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone, hit Orvil Township particularly hard, resulting in the formation of five new boroughs created from the nascent township, including Montvale and Woodcliff (now Woodcliff Lake) on August 31, 1894, Allendale on November 10, 1894, Saddle River on November 20, 1894, and Upper Saddle River formed on November 22, 1894. On April 7, 1919, a council of citizens voted to incorporate as the borough of &quot;Waldwick&quot;, from the remaining portions of Orvil Township. With the creation of the borough of Waldwick, Orvil Township was dissolved.

Various derivations of the borough&#x27;s name have been offered, including one that &quot;Waldwick&quot; is Old English, from &quot;wald&quot; (forest) and &quot;wick&quot; (settlement or place). According to &quot;The History of Bergen County&quot; written in 1900 by James M. Van Valen, the name Waldwick comes from a Saxon language word meaning &quot;beautiful grove&quot; though other sources show a related meaning of &quot;village in a grove&quot;.

The Wallington Fire Department (WFD) is an all-volunteer fire department. The WFD was organized in October 1894 and consists of three fire companies operating out of three firehouses. The department is staffed by 85 fully trained firefighters. The Wallington Fire Department Emergency Squad provides emergency medical and rescue services.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality and by Bergen County.

A very short section of New Jersey Route 21 passes through Wallington. This section was built over a section of the Passaic River which was filled in to allow the highway to be constructed. However, the municipal boundary still follows the old river bed, resulting in a small section of Wallington on the west bank of the river which is mostly occupied by the highway.

County Route 507 is the most significant road directly serving Wallington. Three bridges, the Gregory Avenue Bridge (built in 1905), the Market Street Bridge (dating back to 1894) and the Eighth Street Bridge (originally constructed in 1915) cross the Passaic River from Wallington to the city of Passaic. After years of construction, a new Eighth Street Bridge was completed in 2019 with the assistance of $15 million in aid from the federal government, restoring service to a crossing that had handled more than 6,000 vehicles per day on a bridge that was more than 100 years old.

The New Jersey Turnpike Western Roadway (Interstate 95) is accessible at Exit 16W in neighboring East Rutherford.

===Public transportation===
NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line passes through, but does not stop in, Wallington. Wesmont station is located along the border between Wallington and Wood-Ridge, but it can only be accessed from the latter. NJ Transit bus routes 160 and 161 provide service to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, and routes 703, 707, and 780 provide local service.

<text>Westwood (known as &quot;The Hub of the Pascack Valley&quot;) is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Westwood is part of the New York metropolitan area. Many of its residents regularly commute to New York City for work and leisure, many using public transportation. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 11,282, an increase of 374 (+3.4%) from the 2010 census count of 10,908, which in turn reflected a decline of 91 (−0.8%) from the 10,999 counted in the 2000 census.

Westwood was officially incorporated as a borough on May 8, 1894, from portions of Washington Township, early during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. Isaac D. Bogert served as the first mayor of the borough. In April 1909, Westwood was enlarged through the annexation of the &quot;Old Hook&quot; section of the borough of Emerson, and on September 24, 1957, portions of the borough were exchanged with Emerson.

==History==
The Lenni-Lenape Native Americans inhabited this part of the state and shared it with the transient hunters and trappers until the permanent settlers began to enter in mid-18th century. In the early 19th century, the area that would later become Westwood was within the larger political boundaries of Harrington Township, which had been established by royal charter in 1775. In 1840, the western half of Harrington Township became Washington Township, with the Hackensack River as the dividing line. Washington Township was an agrarian region with isolated farmsteads. Early families, including the Hoppers and Ackermans, are buried at the Old Hook Cemetery. An 18th-century mill was situated at the dammed stream near the intersection of today&#x27;s Mill Street and First Avenue. This mill was on an important east west pathway and was the first on Musquapsink Brook. The mill was largely destroyed after a fire set by an arsonist and was dismantled in 1910.

A brief description of Washington Township written in 1844 described it as a township with six stores, four schools for 135 students, six grist mills, and 14 saw mills.

The first wave of concentrated development took place as the result of the coming of the Hackensack and New York Railroad in 1870, which followed the route of today&#x27;s Pascack Valley Line. On March 5, 1870, service began between Westwood and New York City (via Jersey City and a ferry ride). Several small hotels were built near the depot, and in 1872 several houses in the latest European-influenced styles began to be built along Centre Avenue. Old maps show that growth occurred simultaneously on the land both to the east and west of the tracks. The commercial buildings included lumber and coal sheds, stores, and a bakery. There was a chapel on the corner of Third and Park Avenues. The triangular park that has played an important role as a place of community gatherings is also shown on the 1876 map.

By the 1880s, Westwood had four factories, several distilleries, a new school, a laundry and grocery store, and a new Reformed Church. In 1890, following a meeting of interested residents, those favoring the incorporation of Westwood as an independent borough conducted a petition drive. In 1894, Westwood separated from Washington Township and became an independent borough. Elected as the borough&#x27;s first mayor was Isaac D. Bogert.

In 1899, a water plant constructed by Cornelius S. DeBraun provided service to the houses that had been built along the borough&#x27;s newly laid streets. By the time of the 1905 New Jersey Census, there were 234 dwellings housing a population of 1,044. 
Lincoln High School was constructed around the turn of the 20th century, which also saw the introduction of electricity, telephones, and automobiles to the town. Underwood &amp; Underwood Stereoscope Company opened a plant during the first decades of the 20th century, and many congregations established their first chapels, which were replaced in later years as the congregations grew in numbers and wealth. Following a typical pattern of development throughout the 20th century, the results are a mature railroad suburb almost covered with housing units, commercial, municipal and ecclesiastical buildings. The borough still retains the open space of the triangular park at its center.

<text>Woodcliff Lake is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 6,128, an increase of 398 (+6.9%) from the 2010 census count of 5,730, which in turn reflected a decline of 15 (−0.3%) from the 5,745 counted in the 2000 census. Most of the borough mandates a minimum lot size of for single-family homes, with portions on the borough&#x27;s east zoned for and portions of the borough&#x27;s northwest and southwest zoned for lots.

Woodcliff Lake is also the name of the reservoir that lies predominantly within the borough, with a small portion at the southeastern edge located in neighboring Hillsdale.

==History==
The borough was originally incorporated as the Borough of Woodcliff, on August 31, 1894, from parts of Orvil Township and Washington Township, based on the results of a referendum held three days earlier. The borough was formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. The borough derives its name from the characteristics of its geography.

On March 1, 1910, after the creation of the reservoir, the name of the borough was changed to Woodcliff Lake, to match the name of the post office. Prior to the creation of ZIP Codes as a way to uniquely identify addresses, United States Postal Service policy was that two post offices in a state could not have the same name, and there was already a &quot;Woodcliff&quot; in Hudson County. On January 1, 1956, and again on July 1, 1958, Woodcliff Lake exchanged sections of land with Park Ridge. On October 13, 1960, portions were exchanged with Hillsdale.

Woodcliff Lake has many historic houses and buildings, some dating from the 18th century. Many old buildings are also present, but are likely to have been modified through the years. The borough has seen intense development over the past 50 years, as virtually all areas available for construction have been developed.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 3.55 square miles (9.19 km2), including 3.38 square miles (8.74 km2) of land and 0.17 square miles (0.45 km2) of water (4.85%).

The borough is bordered by the Bergen County municipalities of Hillsdale, Montvale, Park Ridge, River Vale, Saddle River, and small portions of Upper Saddle River. Woodcliff Lake is located approximately northwest of Manhattan.

==Community==
Tice Farms was a farm and roadside stand in Woodcliff Lake. Founded in 1808, it was a local landmark which attracted families from miles around, especially in the fall, when it was noted for pumpkins, apple cider, freshly baked donuts, and other fall products. Many people would make the drive to the area from New York City, causing massive traffic jams on autumn weekends. Beginning in the 1970s, the farm was increasingly squeezed by local land development, and Richard Tice, the head of the family, repeatedly sold land to accommodate development. BMW&#x27;s North American headquarters are located on Chestnut Ridge Road, and is built, and currently being expanded on land once owned by the Tice family. The company is the town&#x27;s predominant landowner. Tice Farms is now Tice&#x27;s Corner, an upscale strip mall.

Van Riper&#x27;s Farm, formerly located approximately across the street from Tice&#x27;s, was founded in the late 18th century and known for its apple cider and annual turkey shoot. It was closed to make way for an A&amp;P supermarket, which was known as the company&#x27;s trademark store. The store was acquired by Acme Markets in 2015 and finally closed in 2019.

A small reminder of Woodcliff Lake&#x27;s rural history is Fusco&#x27;s Market, located on the corner of Werimus and Saddle River Roads. There are still a few small private farms operated in the borough, including of land assessed as farmland for property tax purposes in 2012. One of note is the Woodcliff Acres Horse Farm located on Woodcliff Avenue in between Pascack Road and Weirumus Road, which has been a continually operating horse farm for over 50 years. Nearby is the Old Mill Pond, which was established as the town&#x27;s swimming pool around 1950 when the borough acquired the small, nearly silted-up mill pond near the headwaters of the Musquapsink Brook. Old Mill Pond has been renovated to include a partial sand beach along with a water slide, two diving boards, swimming lanes, and other water activities for kids.

Woodcliff Lake lacks its own public library; however, it offers its residents reimbursement if they pay for a library membership from a neighboring municipality with its own library.

The borough was originally assigned the ZIP Code 07680. As part of post office consolidation in the early 1970s, it lost its postmaster (though not its post office) and was designated a branch of the Westwood post office, sharing the ZIP code 07675. Following longtime public protest, it regained its own ZIP code, 07677, as of July 2000.

<text>Bordentown is a city in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 3,993, an increase of 69 (+1.8%) from the 2010 census count of 3,924, which in turn reflected a decline of 45 (−1.1%) from the 3,969 counted in the 2000 census.

Bordentown is located at the confluence of the Delaware River, Blacks Creek, and Crosswicks Creek. The latter is the border between Burlington and Mercer counties. Bordentown is the northernmost municipality in New Jersey that is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley. It sits about one-third of the distance from Center City, Philadelphia to Midtown Manhattan; it is located south of the state capital Trenton, northeast of Center City Philadelphia, and southwest of New York City.

Bordentown&#x27;s first recorded European settlement was made in 1682 in what became known as Farnsworth&#x27;s Landing and, after 1717, the town that had developed in the Provence of New Jersey was renamed to Borden&#x27;s Town. After the American Revolution and the establishment of the New Jersey state government, Bordentown was incorporated with a borough government form by an act of its legislature on December 9, 1825, from portions within Chesterfield Township. It was reincorporated with a city government form on April 3, 1867, and it was separated from Chesterfield Township about 1877.

==History==
Thomas Farnsworth, an English Quaker, became the first European settler in the Bordentown area in 1682, when he moved his family upriver from Burlington. He made a new home on the windswept bluff overlooking the broad bend in the Delaware River, near today&#x27;s northwest corner of Park Street and Prince Street, perhaps where an 1883 frame house now stands. &quot;Farnsworth Landing&quot; soon became the center of trade for the region. Farnsworth is also the namesake of one of Bordentown&#x27;s main streets, Farnsworth Avenue.

Joseph Borden, for whom the city is named, arrived in 1717, and by May 1740 founded a transportation system to carry people and freight between New York City and Philadelphia. This exploited Bordentown&#x27;s natural location as the point on the Delaware River that provided the shortest overland route to Perth Amboy, from which cargo and people could be ferried to New York City. The town was the childhood home of Patience Wright, America&#x27;s first female sculptor, who lived there in the 1730s.

By 1776, Bordentown was full of Patriots. Joseph Borden&#x27;s son (also named Joseph Borden) became a colonel during the American Revolutionary War. Other noted patriots lived in the area, including Thomas Paine. Francis Hopkinson (a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence), Colonel Kirkbride, and Colonel Oakey Hoagland. Hessian troops briefly occupied Bordentown in 1776 as part of the New York and New Jersey campaign before leaving to engage in the Battle of Iron Works Hill on December 23. On May 8, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign, British forces raided Bordentown in pursuit of retreating American militiamen. The Redcoats burned several Bordentown buildings along with large quantities of American military supplies and several ships in the nearby waters. On June 23, 1778, British forces again raided Bordentown, destroying several buildings.

In August 1831, master mechanic Isaac Dripps of Bordentown re-assembled (without blueprints or instructions) the locomotive John Bull (originally called &quot;The Stevens&quot;) in just 10 days. It was built by Robert Stephenson and Company, in England, and was imported into Philadelphia by the Camden and Amboy Railroad. The next year it started limited service, and the year after that regular service, to become one of the first successful locomotives in the United States. The John Bull is preserved at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

Another notable resident of Bordentown is Clara Barton, who started the first free public school in New Jersey in 1852. Barton later founded the American Red Cross. A recreation of her schoolhouse stands at the corner of Crosswicks and Burlington streets.

In 1866, Susan Waters moved into what is now one of the larger properties on Mary Street. This was a base from which she taught and produced over 50 of her works, many of which are painting of animals in natural settings and pastoral scenes. She was also an early photographer. In 1876 she was asked to exhibit several of her works at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.

In 1881, Rev. William Bowen purchased the old Spring Villa Female Seminary building (built on land purchased from the Bonapartes in 1837) and reopened it as the Bordentown Military Institute. In 1886, African-American Rev. Walter A. Rice established a private school for African-American children, the Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, in a two-story house at 60 West Street, which later moved to Walnut Street on the banks of the Delaware, and became a public school in 1894 under Jim Crow laws. The school, which was known as the Bordentown School, came to have a , 30-building campus with two farms, a vocational/ technical orientation, and a college preparatory program. The Bordentown School operated from 1894 to 1955.

In 1909, the religious order Poor Clares established a convent in the former Motherhouse of the Sisters of Mercy on Crosswicks Street. The building still stands and is used as an assisted living community called The Clare Estate. The Order of Poor Clares moved to a new facility outside Bordentown City.

=== Joseph Bonaparte ===

Several years after the banishing of his family from France in 1816, arriving under vigilant disguise as the Count de Survilliers, Joseph Bonaparte, former King of Naples and Spain and brother to Napoleon I of France, purchased the Point Breeze Estate near Bordentown from American revolutionary, Stephen Sayre. He lived there for 17 years, entertaining guests of great fame such as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and the future 6th U.S. President, John Quincy Adams. The residents of Bordentown nicknamed the Count, &quot;The &quot;Good&quot; Mr. Bonaparte&quot; (&quot;Good&quot; to distinguish him from his younger brother). He built a lake near the mouth of Crosswicks Creek that was about wide and long. On the bluff above it he built a new home, &quot;Point Breeze&quot;. The current Divine Word Mission occupies its former site along Park Street.

Today only vestiges of the Bonaparte estate remain. Much of it is the remains of a formerly Italinate building remodeled in English Georgian Revival style in 1924 for Harris Hammon, who purchased the estate at Point Breeze as built in 1850 by Henry Becket, a British consul in Philadelphia. In addition to the rubble of this mansion and some hedges of its elaborate gardens, only the original tunnel to the river (broken through in several places) and the house of Bonaparte&#x27;s secretary remain. Many descendants of Joachim Murat, King of Naples and brother in law of the Bonapartes executed in 1815, also were born or lived in Bordentown, having followed their uncle Joseph there. After the Bonaparte dynasty was restored by Napoleon III, they moved back to France and were recognized as princes.

==Geography==

The City of Bordentown is surrounded on three sides by Bordentown Township and on the western side by the juncture of the Delaware River and Crosswicks Creek, which is the border with Hamilton Township in Mercer County. It is bounded on the east by U.S. Route 130 and U.S. Route 206, on the south by Black&#x27;s Creek and Interstate 295, and on the north by the Mile Hollow Run. Across the Delaware River is Falls Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

==Government==

===Local government===

Bordentown has been governed under the Walsh Act since 1913. The city is one of 30 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this commission form of government. The governing body is comprised of three commissioners, one of whom is selected to serve as Mayor. Each commissioner is assigned a specific department to oversee during their term in office. Members are elected at-large to four-year concurrent terms of office on a non-partisan basis as part of the May municipal election.

, Bordentown&#x27;s commissioners are
Mayor Jennifer L. Sciortino (Director of Revenue and Finance), 
Deputy Mayor Joe Myers (Director of Public Property, Streets and Water) and
Commissioner Heather Cheesman (Director of Public Safety and Affairs; appointed to an unexpired term), all serving terms of office that end on May 13, 2025.

In March 2024, the commissioners appointed Heather Cheesman to fill the seat that had been held by James E. Lynch Jr., until he resigned from office; Cheeseman will serve on an interim basis until the November 2024 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.

The city&#x27;s municipal complex is located on the site of the Point Breeze estate. Part of the site was purchased by the city in 2020 from the Divine Word Missionaries who occupied the site previously. The repurposed building opened in August 2022. The former city hall was located at 324 Farnsworth Avenue.

====Emergency services====
Hope Hose Humane Fire Company 1 dates its founding to 1767, making it the nation&#x27;s second-oldest volunteer fire service, having taken its current name from the combination in 1976 of the Hope Hose and the Humane fire companies.

Consolidated Fire Association dates back to the 1966 merger of three separate volunteer fire companies.

====Environmental Commission====
The Bordentown City Environmental Commission (BCEC) is a volunteer group of Bordentown City residents. The Commission is an official body, and its chair answers to the Mayor.

<text>Burlington is a city situated on the banks of the Delaware River in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a suburb of Philadelphia. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 9,743, a decrease of 177 (−1.8%) from the 9,920 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 184 (+1.9%) from the 9,736 counted in the 2000 census. The city, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Burlington was first incorporated on October 24, 1693, and was reincorporated by Royal charter on May 7, 1733. After American independence, the city was incorporated by the State of New Jersey on December 21, 1784. On March 14, 1851, the city was reincorporated and enlarged with portions of the surrounding township.

Burlington was originally the county seat of Burlington County. In 1796, in response to the growth of population to the east away from the Delaware River, the county seat was moved to Mount Holly Township, a more central location.

==History==
The council of West Jersey Proprietors purchased roughly of riverfront land in 1676 from the Lenape Native Americans. Burlington was founded on part of that land by English settlers (primarily Quakers) in 1677. It served as the capital of the province until 1702, when West Jersey and East Jersey were combined into a single Crown Colony.

Burlington takes its name (including the county name) from the town of Bridlington, England of which Burlington was a district. It is now amalgamated into the larger Bridlington town.

The Quakers formally established their congregation in 1678. Initially, they met in private homes; between 1683 and 1687, Francis Collings constructed a hexagonal meeting house of brick. Over the next century, the membership grew substantially and a larger building was needed. The present meeting house on High Street was built in 1783 in front of the old meeting house and cemetery. The cemetery predated the first building. A tablet commemorates that the Lenape chief King Ockanickon, a loyal friend of the English settlers, was buried here in 1681. The oldest gravestone is inscribed &quot;D.B. 1726.&quot; Many notable Quakers are buried here.

One of the oldest buildings in Burlington is known as the Revell House. Originally built in 1685 for George Hutchinson, it stood on East Pearl Street. The property was purchased by Thomas Revell, one of the original Anglo-European settlers. Local tradition associates this house with the young Benjamin Franklin, who received gingerbread from the household while traveling from Boston to Philadelphia.

In the early 20th century, the house was purchased by the Annis Stockton Chapter of the DAR for use as their clubhouse. The Colonial Burlington Foundation acquired and restored it in the 1950s.

===18th century===

Many institutions established in the 18th century continue to function in the 21st century. After the Quakers, the second oldest religious congregation in Burlington were the Anglicans (later known as Episcopalians). Their original church, Old St. Mary&#x27;s, is the oldest church in Burlington and New Jersey. The congregation was founded in 1702 by George Keith and John Talbot. Talbot became the first minister and laid the cornerstone for the church in 1703. He served as the church&#x27;s rector until 1725. The congregation prospered, and the church became the see of the Anglican bishops of New Jersey.

After the Revolution, the Episcopal Church in the United States was established. In 1846, under the leadership of Bishop and Rector George Washington Doane, construction was begun on New St. Mary&#x27;s. This early Gothic Revival architecture church was designed by Richard Upjohn, who also designed Trinity Church at the foot of Wall Street in Lower Manhattan. In the late 20th century, this building was designated as a National Historic Landmark (NHL).

Bishop Doane founded an Episcopal girls&#x27; boarding school, St. Mary&#x27;s, in Burlington in 1838, at a time when interest in girls&#x27; education led to development of schools for them in many areas. Girls from families up and down the East Coast came to study there, from as far as New England, Virginia, and upstate New York. St. Mary&#x27;s provided a classical education, as well as classes in arts and music.

The Library Company of Burlington was organized in 1757 as a &quot;free&quot; library open to the public as well as members. There were 60 members of the original Library Company, each paying ten shillings per year to support the institution. The Library received a Charter from George II of Great Britain in 1758. The Library&#x27;s books were kept in members&#x27; homes for a few years: Thomas Rodman&#x27;s at 446 South High Street and, after 1767, Robert Smith&#x27;s at 218 High Street. In 1789 the Library moved to its own building. In the early 21st century, the Library is housed in a stone building that was built on West Union Street in 1864. The Burlington Library is the oldest continuously operating library in New Jersey and the nation&#x27;s seventh oldest.

The Endeavor Fire Company was organized in 1795. It was one of the four companies in the Burlington Fire Department when it was organized almost a century later. Endeavor was the first permanent firefighting organization in Burlington and remains one of the oldest fire companies under its original name in the state. By 1882, the company had relocated to its present building, which was erected in 1852 as a Market House.

Burlington has been the home of many notable people including John Lawrence, a politician and his son, Captain James Lawrence. The elder Lawrence served in the State Assembly, as Mayor of Burlington, New Jersey in 1769, and as a member of the Provincial Council from 1771 to 1775. He was suspected of being a Loyalist during the American Revolution, which ended his career. His son was born on October 1, 1781, and fought during the War of 1812. Lawyer and writer James Fenimore Cooper, who wrote &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, was also from Burlington. His father was a merchant there before buying land and developing Cooperstown, New York after the Revolution.

===19th century===
As education for girls and young women became emphasized in the 19th century, Bishop George Washington Doane founded St. Mary&#x27;s Hall in 1837 in association with the Episcopal diocese as the first Episcopal boarding school offering a classical education for girls and the first such school in New Jersey. In the 20th century, a boys&#x27; school was added. It is now known as Doane Academy and is a private, co-educational school for grades from Pre-K through 12th.

The building at 301 High Street houses the oldest continuously operating pharmacy in New Jersey. Originally a dwelling, the ground floor was converted to commercial use around 1845 by William Allinson, a druggist, local historian, and leading Quaker abolitionist. He used the building as a center of anti-slavery activity. John Greenleaf Whittier denounced slavery from the doorstep, and local tradition holds that fugitive slaves hid in tunnels under the building in their passage on the Underground Railroad. New Jersey ended slavery, but many fugitives wanted to go farther north, beyond the reach of slave catchers.

During the 19th century, Burlington City was known for the quality and quantity of its manufacturing. The shoe industry rivaled shipbuilding and canning in prominence. The 1850 United States census indicates that the largest number of men were employed in the shoe industry, followed closely by carpentry and bricklaying. J. Frank Budd got his start in the shoe business at a Burlington shoe company just after the Civil War. In 1887, J.F. Budd broke ground for a children&#x27;s &quot;shoeworks&quot; at the corner of Penn and Dilwyn streets. The company employed approximately 325 people and operated six days a week for ten hours a day. The J.F. Budd Baby Shoe Company billed itself as the &quot;largest baby shoe plant in the world.&quot;

The commercial activity provided revenues for the city&#x27;s cultural activity. In 1839, a Lyceum was erected as a venue for lectures, concerts, and public meetings. It served in that capacity until 1851, when it was turned over to the city to be used as the City Hall. The municipal offices&#x27; move was concurrent with the adoption of a new City charter.

The Oneida Boat Club was organized in 1873 by a group of 10 members. It is named for one of the original Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York. Over the next few years, membership in the club grew rapidly. In 1876, they dedicated their newly built clubhouse on the banks of the Delaware River at York Street. The Oneida is the oldest continuously operating boat club located on the Delaware River.

During the 19th century, the City of Burlington developed in a grid pattern from the main crossroads of High and Broad streets. Blocks of attached rowhouses built in the latest architectural style characterize the city as a 19th-century town. Ferries carried traffic across the Delaware River to Pennsylvania before bridges were built.

===20th century===

Burlington&#x27;s waterfront park along the river was developed as a result of urban renewal and flood control projects in the late 1960s and 1970s. The shoreline improvements—revetments, walkways, etc.—span the city&#x27;s Delaware riverfront from the Burlington-Bristol Bridge to Assiscunk Creek.

The remains of former waterfront industries, ferry terminals, and docks were demolished. Development of an open, grassy park with a tree-lined waterfront esplanade has reconnected city residents to the riverfront for recreation. This also ensures that business properties are not at risk during floods and reduces damages.

In this period, the United States federal and state governments began to value their historic assets more highly, and efforts were made to preserve structures that were significant to the layered history of places. In addition to recognition of individual structures, such as the National Historic Landmark St. Mary&#x27;s Church, the city has two historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with multiple contributing buildings: the Burlington Historic District includes structures from both the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is adjacent to the city&#x27;s High Street Historic District.

The Oneida Clubhouse narrowly escaped demolition during the urban renewal campaign. It was saved and renovated. As the new esplanade was built on fill that added land between the building and river&#x27;s edge, it created a landlocked clubhouse for the boat club.

Burlington Coat Factory was founded in 1924 as a wholesaler of ladies&#x27; coats and outerwear. The modern company was formed in 1972 when Monroe Milstein purchased a warehouse in the outskirts of the city of Burlington. He started selling coats and outerwear there at discount prices. The company gradually added other apparel, including suits, shoes, and accessories, and has branched out to include baby items and linens, all at discount prices. The company&#x27;s corporate headquarters was moved from the city to Burlington Township in 1988. The Burlington Coat Factory relocated to a new store site in the fall of 2008.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 3.78 square miles (9.79 km2), including 3.06 square miles (7.93 km2) of land and 0.72 square miles (1.87 km2) of water (19.05%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Burlington Island and East Burlington.

Burlington borders Burlington Township in Burlington County and both Bristol and Bristol Township across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.

The Burlington-Bristol Bridge crosses the Delaware River, connecting Burlington to Bristol.

The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in &quot;Abbott v. Burke&quot; which are now referred to as &quot;SDA Districts&quot; based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority.

<text>Chesterfield Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 9,422, its highest decennial census count ever and an increase of 1,723 (+22.4%) from the 2010 census count of 7,699, which in turn had reflected an increase of 1,744 (+29.3%) from the 5,955 counted at the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than of farmland through state and county programs and a township-wide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated &quot;receiving area&quot; known as Old York Village, which is a neo-traditional, New Urbanism community built on incorporating a variety of housing types, neighborhood commercial facilities, a new elementary school, civic uses, and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village. Construction began in the early 2000s and a significant percentage of the community is now complete. As of 2024, the majority of the construction is complete, including Old York Village&#x27;s mixed-use commercial, retail, and housing component. Old York Village was the winner of the American Planning Association&#x27;s National Outstanding Planning Award in 2004.

== History ==

The land was first settled in 1677, when a group of primarily Quaker immigrants from England established the settlement of Crosswicks, the oldest of the three communities of the township. The village was named after the Crosswicks Creek that separates Burlington and Mercer counties. The other two villages were Recklesstown (now Chesterfield) and Plattsburg (now Sykesville). Recklesstown was named in honor of one of its founders, Joseph Reckless, until the community&#x27;s name was changed in 1888 at the urging of a Congressman and local resident in the face of public scorn.

Chesterfield Township was originally formed on November 6, 1688. It was named after the 2nd Earl of Chesterfield whose seat of Chesterfield was in Derbyshire, where many of the township&#x27;s earliest settlers had lived. The township was reformed by royal charter on January 10, 1713, and was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial 104 townships by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form New Hanover Township (December 2, 1723) and Bordentown borough (December 9, 1825).

Crosswicks played a role during the American Revolutionary War. On June 23, 1778, British soldiers near the Crosswicks Creek shot the horse out from under Elias Dayton, a captain with the New Jersey militia. A cannonball from the period remains lodged in the side of the Friends Meeting House.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 21.45 square miles (55.57 km2), including 21.31 square miles (55.20 km2) of land and 0.14 square miles (0.37 km2) of water (0.67%).

Municipalities bordering the township are Bordentown Township, Mansfield Township, North Hanover Township, Springfield Township in Burlington County; and Hamilton Township in Mercer County.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Chesterfield, Crosswicks, Davisville and Extonville.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===

Chesterfield Township is governed under the township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At a reorganization meeting held in January of each year, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor, which by tradition has the committeeperson serving the last year of term in office chosen to serve as mayor. The Township Committee serves both as the township&#x27;s executive and legislative body, and derives from the state statutes which delegates powers, prescribe the offices and structure and establish various procedures under which the Township must operate. In the 2013 general election, voters approved an expansion of the Township Committee from three members to five, with three seats up for election in November 2014; the existing seat expiring that year, a new three-year seat and a seat with a two-year term, with the full cycle starting as of the 2015 general election.

, members of the Chesterfield Township Committee are Mayor Matthew Litt (D, term on committee and as mayor ends December 31, 2023), Deputy Mayor Denise E. Koetas-Dale (D, term on committee ends 2026; term as deputy mayor ends 2024), Belinda Blazic (R, 2024), Shreekant Dhopte (D, 2025) and Rebecca Hughes (R, 2026).

After the November 2016 general election ended with a tie between Democrat Rita Romeu and Republican Ron Kolczynski who both had 1,289 votes for the second of two township committee seats, a judge in January 2017 decided that Romeu won the race as she was entitled to two additional votes that had not been counted in November.

=== Federal, state and county representation ===

==Transportation==

, the township had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Burlington County and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

Major county roads that pass through include Route 528, Route 537 and Route 545.

The New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) passes through the northwestern part of the township, entering on the western border with Bordentown Township and continuing for approximately into Hamilton Township in Mercer County. The nearest interchange is Exit 7 in neighboring Bordentown Township.

From 2004 when plans were announced until its completion in early November 2014, the Turnpike was widened along a stretch between Interchange 6 in Mansfield Township to Interchange 9 in East Brunswick Township in Middlesex County. Two new carriageways (to accommodate the outer roadways, or truck lanes) were built from Interchange 6 to Interchange 8A in Monroe Township, Middlesex County, and an additional lane on the existing outer roadways was added as well between Interchanges 8A and 9, bringing the roadway up to 12 lanes of traffic in a 3-3-3-3 &quot;dual-dual&quot; configuration of separate truck and car lanes in each direction.

There is no public transportation provided in the township. In neighboring Bordentown, the RiverLINE provides service to Camden and Trenton. NJ Transit provides service on the Northeast Corridor Line to Penn Station New York in nearby Hamilton Township, where many township residents commute for work.

<text>Cinnaminson Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Cinnaminson Township borders the Delaware River, and is an eastern suburb of Philadelphia. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 17,064, an increase of 1,495 (+9.6%) from the 2010 census count of 15,569, which in turn reflected an increase of 974 (+6.7%) from the 14,595 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Cinnaminson was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 15, 1860, from portions of Chester Township (now known as Maple Shade Township). Portions of the township were taken to form Delran Township (February 12, 1880), Riverton (December 18, 1893) and Palmyra (April 19, 1894).

== History ==
Cinnaminson was formed by resolution in 1860 from a section of Chester Township. Part of this resolution reads, &quot;The inhabitants of the township of Chester having become so numerous that it is impracticable for them to meet with convenience and good order in one assembly... the Township shall be divided.&quot;

The name &quot;Cinnaminson&quot; is said to derive from the Lenape Native American word &quot;Senamensing,&quot; which means &quot;sweet water&quot;. Alternatively, the name may derive from Native American words meaning &quot;stone island&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 7.95 square miles (20.60 km2), including 7.42 square miles (19.23 km2) of land and 0.53 square miles (1.37 km2) of water (6.64%).

The township borders the municipalities of Delran Township, Maple Shade Township, Moorestown Township, Palmyra and Riverton in Burlington County; Pennsauken Township in Camden County; and Philadelphia across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.

Cinnaminson includes within its boundaries the confluence point of longitude 75 degrees west and latitude 40 degrees north, one of only four such confluence points in New Jersey. The intersection point is on the 4th fairway of the Riverton Country Club Golf Course, less than mile from the Municipal Building.

<text>Delanco Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 4,824, an increase of 541 (+12.6%) from the 2010 census count of 4,283, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,046 (+32.3%) from the 3,237 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Delanco was named for the Delaware River and Rancocas Creek, which border the community. It was originally called Del-Ranco or Delaranco, a syllabic abbreviation later shortened to Delanco.

It is a dry township where alcohol cannot be sold.

==History==
What is now Delanco Township was originally incorporated as Beverly Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 1, 1859, within Willingboro Township. Delanco was a geographical place name by 1868, and probably earlier. At its creation, Beverly Township included Beverly city, which separated as an independent municipality . Portions of the township were taken to create Edgewater Park on February 26, 1924. The township&#x27;s name was changed to Delanco Township as of December 20, 1926, based on the results of a referendum held on November 2, 1926.

In April 1861, the Sixth Massachusetts Militia passed through Delanco, on their way to Washington to defend the federal capital. According to the report of Colonel Edward F. Jones during their travel, James Brady was &quot;taken insane&quot; and left in Delanco Township with J. C. Buck. When the regiment arrived in Baltimore, Maryland, it was attacked during the Baltimore riot of 1861.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 3.33 square miles (8.62 km2), including 2.36 square miles (6.11 km2) of land and 0.97 square miles (2.52 km2) of water (29.19%).

The township borders the municipalities of Beverly, Delran Township, Edgewater Park Township, Riverside Township, Willingboro Township in Burlington County; and also borders Bensalem Township and the city of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, across the Delaware River.

<text>The Tevatron was a circular particle accelerator (active until 2011) in the United States, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (called &quot;Fermilab&quot;), east of Batavia, Illinois, and was the highest energy particle collider until the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) was built near Geneva, Switzerland. The Tevatron was a synchrotron that accelerated protons and antiprotons in a circumference ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million and significant upgrade investments were made during its active years of 1983–2011.

The main achievement of the Tevatron was the discovery in 1995 of the top quark—the last fundamental fermion predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. On July 2, 2012, scientists of the CDF and DØ collider experiment teams at Fermilab announced the findings from the analysis of around 500 trillion collisions produced from the Tevatron collider since 2001, and found that the existence of the suspected Higgs boson was highly likely with a confidence of 99.8%, later improved to over 99.9%.

The Tevatron ceased operations on 30 September 2011, due to budget cuts and because of the completion of the LHC, which began operations in early 2010 and is far more powerful (planned energies were two 7 TeV beams at the LHC compared to 1 TeV at the Tevatron). The main ring of the Tevatron will probably be reused in future experiments, and its components may be transferred to other particle accelerators.

==History==
December 1, 1968, saw the breaking of ground for the linear accelerator (linac). The construction of the Main Accelerator Enclosure began on October 3, 1969, when the first shovel of earth was turned by Robert R. Wilson, NAL&#x27;s director. This would become the 6.3 km circumference Fermilab&#x27;s Main Ring.

The linac first 200 MeV beam started on December 1, 1970. The booster first 8 GeV beam was produced on May 20, 1971. On June 30, 1971, a proton beam was guided for the first time through the entire National Accelerator Laboratory accelerator system including the Main Ring. The beam was accelerated to only 7 GeV. Back then, the Booster Accelerator took 200 MeV protons from the Linac and &quot;boosted&quot; their energy to 8 billion electron volts. They were then injected into the Main Accelerator.

On the same year before the completion of the Main Ring, Wilson testified to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on March 9, 1971, that it was feasible to achieve a higher energy by using superconducting magnets. He also suggested that it could be done by using the same tunnel as the main ring and the new magnets would be installed in the same locations to be operated in parallel to the existing magnets of the Main Ring. That was the starting point of the Tevatron project. The Tevatron was in research and development phase between 1973 and 1979 while the acceleration at the Main Ring continued to be enhanced.

A series of milestones saw acceleration rise to 20 GeV on January 22, 1972, to 53 GeV on February 4 and to 100 GeV on February 11. On March 1, 1972, the then NAL accelerator system accelerated for the first time a beam of protons to its design energy of 200 GeV. By the end of 1973, NAL&#x27;s accelerator system operated routinely at 300 GeV.

On 14 May 1976 Fermilab took its protons all the way to 500 GeV. This achievement provided the opportunity to introduce a new energy scale, the teraelectronvolt (TeV), equal to 1000 GeV. On 17 June of that year, the European Super Proton Synchrotron accelerator (SPS) had achieved an initial circulating proton beam (with no accelerating radio-frequency power) of only 400 GeV.

The conventional magnet Main Ring was shut down in 1981 for installation of superconducting magnets underneath it. The Main Ring continued to serve as an injector for the Tevatron until the Main Injector was completed west of the Main Ring in 2000. The &#x27;Energy Doubler&#x27;, as it was known then, produced its first accelerated beam—512 GeV—on July 3, 1983.

Its initial energy of 800 GeV was achieved on February 16, 1984. On October 21, 1986, acceleration at the Tevatron was pushed to 900 GeV, providing a first proton–antiproton collision at 1.8 TeV on November 30, 1986.

The &quot;Main Injector&quot;, which replaced the Main Ring, was the most substantial addition, built over six years from 1993 at a cost of $290 million. Tevatron collider Run II begun on March 1, 2001, after successful completion of that facility upgrade. From then, the beam had been capable of delivering an energy of 980 GeV.

On July 16, 2004, the Tevatron achieved a new peak luminosity, breaking the record previously held by the old European Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) at CERN. That very Fermilab record was doubled on September 9, 2006, then a bit more than tripled on March 17, 2008, and ultimately multiplied by a factor of 4 over the previous 2004 record on April 16, 2010 (up to 4 cm−2 s−1).

The Tevatron ceased operations on 30 September 2011. By the end of 2011, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN had achieved a luminosity almost ten times higher than Tevatron&#x27;s (at 3.65 cm−2 s−1) and a beam energy of 3.5 TeV each (doing so since March 18, 2010), already ~3.6 times the capabilities of the Tevatron (at 0.98 TeV).

==Mechanics==

The acceleration occurred in a number of stages. The first stage was the 750 keV &quot;Cockcroft–Walton&quot; pre-accelerator, which ionized hydrogen gas and accelerated the negative ions created using a positive voltage. The ions then passed into the 150 meter long linear accelerator (linac) which used oscillating electrical fields to accelerate the ions to 400 MeV. The ions then passed through a carbon foil, to remove the electrons, and the charged protons then moved into the &quot;Booster&quot;.

The Booster was a small circular synchrotron, around which the protons passed up to 20,000 times to attain an energy of around 8 GeV. From the Booster the particles were fed into the Main Injector, which had been completed in 1999 to perform a number of tasks. It could accelerate protons up to 150 GeV; produce 120 GeV protons for antiproton creation; increase antiproton energy to 150 GeV; and inject protons or antiprotons into the Tevatron. The antiprotons were created by the &quot;Antiproton Source&quot;. 120 GeV protons were collided with a nickel target producing a range of particles including antiprotons which could be collected and stored in the accumulator ring. The ring could then pass the antiprotons to the Main Injector.

The Tevatron could accelerate the particles from the Main Injector up to 980 GeV. The protons and antiprotons were accelerated in opposite directions, crossing paths in the CDF and DØ detectors to collide at 1.96 TeV. To hold the particles on track the Tevatron used 774 niobium–titanium superconducting dipole magnets cooled in liquid helium producing the field strength of 4.2 tesla. The field ramped over about 20 seconds as the particles accelerated. Another 240 NbTi quadrupole magnets were used to focus the beam.

The initial design luminosity of the Tevatron was 1030 cm−2 s−1, however, following upgrades, the accelerator had been able to deliver luminosities up to 4 cm−2 s−1.

On September 27, 1993, the cryogenic cooling system of the Tevatron Accelerator was named an International Historic Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The system, which provided cryogenic liquid helium to the Tevatron&#x27;s superconducting magnets, was the largest low-temperature system in existence upon its completion in 1978. It kept the coils of the magnets, which bent and focused the particle beam, in a superconducting state, so that they consumed only ⅓ of the power they would have required at normal temperatures.

==Discoveries==
The Tevatron confirmed the existence of several subatomic particles that were predicted by theoretical particle physics, or gave suggestions to their existence. In 1995, the CDF experiment and DØ experiment collaborations announced the discovery of the top quark, and by 2007 they measured its mass (172 GeV) to a precision of nearly 1%. 
In 2006, the CDF collaboration reported the first measurement of Bs oscillations, and observation of two types of sigma baryons.
In 2007, the DØ and CDF collaborations reported direct observation of the &quot;Cascade B&quot; () Xi baryon.

In September 2008, the DØ collaboration reported detection of the , a &quot;double strange&quot; Omega baryon with the measured mass significantly higher than the quark model prediction. In May 2009 the CDF collaboration made public their results on search for based on analysis of data sample roughly four times larger than the one used by DØ experiment. The mass measurements from the CDF experiment were and in excellent agreement with Standard Model predictions, and no signal has been observed at the previously reported value from the DØ experiment. The two inconsistent results from DØ and CDF differ by or by 6.2 standard deviations. Due to excellent agreement between the mass measured by CDF and the theoretical expectation, it is a strong indication that the particle discovered by CDF is indeed the . It is anticipated that new data from LHC experiments will clarify the situation in the near future.

On July 2, 2012, two days before a scheduled announcement at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), scientists at the Tevatron collider from the CDF and DØ collaborations announced their findings from the analysis of around 500 trillion collisions produced since 2001: They found that the existence of the Higgs boson was likely with a mass in the region of 115 to 135 GeV. The statistical significance of the observed signs was 2.9 sigma, which meant that there is only a 1-in-550 chance that a signal of that magnitude would have occurred if no particle in fact existed with those properties. The final analysis of data from the Tevatron did however not settle the question of whether the Higgs particle exists. Only when the scientists from the Large Hadron Collider announced the more precise LHC results on July 4, 2012, with a mass of 125.3 ± 0.4 GeV (CMS) or 126 ± 0.4 GeV (ATLAS) respectively, was there strong evidence through consistent measurements by the LHC and the Tevatron for the existence of a Higgs particle at that mass range.

==Disruptions due to earthquakes==
Even from thousands of miles away, earthquakes caused strong enough movements in the magnets to negatively affect the quality of particle beams and even disrupt them. Therefore, tiltmeters were installed on Tevatron&#x27;s magnets to monitor minute movements and to help identify the cause of problems quickly. The first known earthquake to disrupt the beam was the 2002 Denali earthquake, with another collider shutdown caused by a moderate local quake on June 28, 2004. Since then, the minute seismic vibrations emanating from over 20 earthquakes were detected at the Tevatron without a shutdown including the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, New Zealand&#x27;s 2007 Gisborne earthquake, the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2010 Chile earthquake.

<text>Delran Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 17,882, an increase of 986 (+5.8%) from the 2010 census count of 16,896, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,360 (+8.8%) from the 15,536 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Delran Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 12, 1880, from portions of Cinnaminson Township. Portions of the township were taken to create Riverside Township on February 20, 1895.

The township&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of the names of the two waterways that have their confluence here: the [[Delran Township, New Jersey|Del]]aware River and [[Delran Township, New Jersey|Ran]]cocas Creek.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 7.25 square miles (18.78 km2), including 6.63 square miles (17.17 km2) of land and 0.62 square miles (1.61 km2) of water (8.58%).

The township borders Cinnaminson Township, Delanco Township, Moorestown Township, Riverside Township and Willingboro Township in Burlington County; and Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, across the Delaware River.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Bridgeboro, Cambridge, Chesterville, Fairview, Milltown and Riverside Park.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===
The 2020 United States census counted 17,882 people, about 6,233 households and about 4,336 families. The population density was 2,697.1 per square mile (1041.4/km2). There were 6,763 housing units in the township.
