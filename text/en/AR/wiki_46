<text>Austin is a city in and the county seat of Mower County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 26,174 at the 2020 census. The town was originally settled along the Cedar River and has two artificial lakes, East Side Lake and Mill Pond. It was named for Austin R. Nichols, the area&#x27;s first European settler. It is part of the Rochester, Minnesota metropolitan area.

Hormel Foods Corporation is Austin&#x27;s largest employer, and the city is sometimes called &quot;SPAM Town USA&quot;. Austin is home to Hormel&#x27;s corporate headquarters, a factory that makes most of North America&#x27;s SPAM tinned meat, and the Spam Museum. Austin is also home to the Hormel Institute, a leading cancer research institution operated by the University of Minnesota with significant support from the Mayo Clinic.

==History==

Fertile land, trapping, and ease of access brought first trappers and then the early pioneers to this region. The rich gameland attracted Austin Nichols, a trapper who built the first log cabin in 1853. At that time there were &quot;about twenty families in the area.&quot; More settlers began to arrive by wagon train in 1855, and by 1856 enough people were present to organize Mower County. In 1856 the settlement adopted the name &quot;Austin&quot;, in honor of its first settler. That year the first hotel opened to travelers and the first physician, Dr. Ormanzo Allen, moved to town. The first newspaper, the &quot;Mower County Mirror&quot;, was started in 1858.

Mills, powered by the Cedar River, were the first industries in Austin. They provided much-needed flour and lumber. Growth was slow during the first two decades, but the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad arrived in the late 1860s, hastening economic development. The town&#x27;s first schoolhouse was constructed in 1865, and the first bank opened the following year.

In 1891 George A. Hormel opened a small family-owned butcher shop in Austin, which eventually grew into today&#x27;s Fortune 500 company, Hormel Foods. By 1896 area doctors, with the help of local Lutheran congregations, formed the Austin Hospital Association, later becoming St. Olaf Hospital, and (since 1995) part of Mayo Clinic Health System.

In 1897 Charles Boostrom opened Austin&#x27;s first college, the Southern Minnesota Normal College and Austin School of Commerce. It closed in 1925, and the city was without an institution of higher education until Austin Junior College opened in 1940. In 1964 it became part of the State College and University System and is now Riverland Community College.

In 1913 the Minnesota Legislature made a parcel of land into Horace Austin State Park. At the time, the land was &quot;one of the beauty spots of Southern Minnesota, but of late years has not been cared for and in places the banks have been disfigured by dumping along the shore of the stream,&quot; according to the bill&#x27;s author, Senator Charles F. Cook. The park was converted to a state &quot;scenic wayside&quot; in 1937, then transferred to city ownership in 1949.

In the 1930s Austin Acres was built with funding from the Subsistence Homesteads Division of the Department of the Interior. The Austin Parks Board was formed in the 1940s to oversee the growing number of green spaces within the city.
In 1971 the Jay C. Hormel Nature Center, a nature preserve also including the Hormel Arboretum, was purchased from Geordie Hormel with a state grant. In 1973 the city opened Riverside Arena, the city&#x27;s first indoor ice arena, now home to a variety of ice activities including the Austin Bruins junior hockey team.

In August 1985, 1,500 Hormel meatpackers went on strike at the Austin plant after management demanded a 23% cut in wages. In the early 1980s, recession had impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which led smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained. A protracted battle between union employees and Hormel continued until June 1986, one of the longest labor struggles of the 1980s. In January 1986 some workers crossed the picket lines, leading to riots; the conflict escalated to such a point that Governor Rudy Perpich called in the National Guard to keep the peace. The strike received national attention and a documentary, &quot;American Dream&quot;, was filmed during the 10-month conflict. The movie was released in 1990 and won Best Documentary Feature at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards. Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum wrote a song about the strike, &quot;P-9&quot;. It is on the band&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Clam Dip &amp; Other Delights&quot;. Hormel never gave in to the workers&#x27; demands, and when the strike ended in June 1986, 700 employees were left without work.

===21st century===

Austin completed a new $28 million courthouse and jail in 2010, a new intermediate school in 2013, and has a major redevelopment project at the site of the former Oak Park Mall.

The city is embarking on a community development project, Vision 2020. This grassroots movement was chartered in 2011 to implement ten major new community initiatives that could be completed by 2020. It includes a variety of projects related to economic development, heath and wellness, education, and tourism. A community recreation center is in progress, as is a tourism and visitor center. One goal is to make the downtown business district more of a destination, aided in part by the Spam Museum&#x27;s relocation to Main Street in 2016.

In 2015 the National Association of Realtors named Austin one of the &quot;Top 10 Affordable Small Towns Where You&#x27;d Actually Want to Live.&quot;

===Major floods===

Austin has a long history of flooding. The Cedar River, along with Dobbins Creek and Turtle Creek, flow through Austin, and many homes and businesses were constructed in floodplains. A series of floods between 1978 and 2010 resulted in a major flood mitigation program. This involved the purchase and demolition of buildings within the floodplain, converting low-lying areas of town to parks, and the installation of a flood wall to protect downtown.

After two major floods in July 1978, city officials and local residents decided to take action. Locals organized the Floodway Action Citizens Task Source (FACTS), which met with local and state leaders, as well as members of the Army Corps of Engineers, but it was decided that major flood prevention measures would not be cost-effective. A Community Development Block Grant was won from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, allowing for the buyout of homes lying in the flood plain. City planners also vowed to no longer build new structures in the existing flood plains. In 1983 and 1993 major floods again damaged many Austin homes and businesses. Over 400 homes were affected and a new round of buyouts took place through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP).

The worst flooding on record came when the Cedar River crested at in the spring of 2000. Many of the worst-hit parts of town were now void of homes and businesses, but there was still damage and extensive clean-up was required. Flooding came again in September 2004, resulting in two fatalities. Additional protection (dikes) were added along the Cedar River as a result.

The most recent round of serious flooding came in 2010, after which a plan was developed for a permanent flood wall to protect downtown from the floodwaters of the Cedar River and Mill Pond. The wall was completed in 2014.

===Major tornadoes===

On Monday, August 20, 1928, an F-2 sized tornado touched down on Winona Street (1st Avenue). The damage ran from the southern edge of Austin High School to the Milwaukee Road railyards on the city&#x27;s east side. St. Olaf Lutheran Church, Carnegie Library, Main Street, the spire on Austin&#x27;s former courthouse, Grand Theatre (replaced in 1929 by the Paramount Theatre), Austin Utilities, Lincoln School, and several boxcars at the Milwaukee railyards were damaged or destroyed. Austin residents noticed debris raining out of the sky, such as straw and laundry.

Another F-2 touched down in August 1961, at 808 18th Street SW. It quickly gained strength once on the ground, becoming an F-3 at 17th Street SW, where it destroyed a garage. The twister lifted briefly, touching down in the city fairgrounds and hitting the grandstand roof, tearing off parts and damaging beams.

In the summer of 1984, a tornado destroyed Echo Lanes Bowling Alley as it swept through southeast Austin. Neighboring Bo-Dee Campers also suffered considerable damage, and Schmidt TV was destroyed.

A tornado or straight-line winds took down massive amounts of branches and trees on Saturday, June 27, 1998, uprooting smaller trees and knocking large branches across streets. Several side streets in northwest Austin became impassable, including 8th Avenue NW (near Sumner Elementary School) and 14th Street NW (between I-90 and 8th Avenue). The event caused disruption in Sunday church services the next morning, and many congregations organized cleanup activities instead of regularly scheduled events.

A tornado touched down in Glenville on May 1, 2001, gaining strength before it turned into a F-3 headed for Austin. The twister dissipated shortly after hitting town, but did notable damage in both cities.

On Wednesday, June 17, 2009, an EF2 tornado touched down outside Austin and moved across the northwest and northern parts of the city, gradually weakening as it moved east. The worst damage in Austin was about north of downtown. The visitors center at the Jay C. Hormel Nature Center sustained damage, losing 300 trees. There were a few minor injuries.

==Economy==

With Hormel&#x27;s corporate headquarters and main production facility in Austin, food processing plays a dominant role in the city&#x27;s economy. Hormel and Quality Pork Processors, a contract food processing firm serving Hormel, are by far the city&#x27;s largest private employers. Though most famous for SPAM, Hormel also produces many other brands, such as Jennie-O turkey, Muscle Milk, Skippy peanut butter, and Dinty Moore beef stew.

The government, education, hospitality, and retail sectors comprise much of the remainder of Austin&#x27;s employment base.

Hormel&#x27;s consistent and steady growth have resulted in below-average unemployment rates for Austin and Mower County in recent years. As of February 2016 the unemployment rate was 3.7% in Austin and Mower County, below both the state and national average.

Austin-area businesses and community actively supported an application to participate as a test community in the Google Fiber project, begun in 2010. Though unsuccessful in their bid, the adoption of high-speed fiber optic and wireless internet throughout Austin is one of the Vision 2020 committee&#x27;s goals.

Austin&#x27;s retail business struggled during the Great Recession, including the demise of the Oak Park Mall. As of 2017 the business climate had improved, including a major redevelopment of the former mall site. Downtown remains vibrant as well, including construction of a new SPAM Museum in 2016.

===Top employers===

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

====Airports====
Austin is served by Austin Municipal Airport, a public-owned, public-use airport located on the east edge of the city. The nearest commercial international airports are located in Rochester (RST), to the northeast, and the Twin Cities (MSP), to the north.

====Bus and mass transit====
Southern Minnesota Area Rural Transit (SMART) provides bus transit within Austin and Mower County; daily routes, as well as on-demand pick-up and drop-off service is available. Rochester City Lines provides daily bus transportation between Austin and Rochester. For travel within the city, there is also local taxi service available.

====Major highways====
Austin is located at the intersection of Interstate 90 and U.S. Route 218. Minnesota State Highway 105 runs from Austin south to Iowa.
* Interstate 90 runs east-west through the north side of the city. The highway leads west to Albert Lea and northeast to the Rochester area.
* U.S. Route 218 passes through the east side of the city as 21st Street, joins I-90 through the north side of the city between exits 180 and 177, and leaves through the northwest part of the city on 14th Street.
* Minnesota State Highway 105 passes through the southern and western sides of the city as 12th Street SW and West Oakland Avenue. It terminates at I-90 in the western end of the city.

====Rail====

Austin was once a railroad town. It was a division point and the site of car shops for the Milwaukee Road, five lines of which met in Austin. The community was also served by the Chicago Great Western&#x27;s north–south mainline for trains between the Twin Cities and Omaha. All lines served passengers, and the Milwaukee Road Depot was a busy station ferrying travelers to and from Austin. Passenger rail service on the Milwaukee Road through Austin between Calmar, Iowa and St. Paul ended in 1953, and Pullman sleeper service on the Milwaukee between Austin and Chicago ended in 1960. An overnight train on the Chicago Great Western between the Twin Cities and Omaha called at Austin, with the southbound coming through late in the evening and the northbound train stopping early in the morning. This train last ran on September 30, 1965, ending all passenger train service to Austin. Freight service continues on the former Milwaukee Road mainline on that railroad&#x27;s successor, the Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad, a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific, but the Chicago Great Western was abandoned and torn up after the Chicago and North Western Railway acquired it in 1968.

====Trails====
Austin has an extensive network of paved recreational trails for biking and hiking. There are several miles of bike paths extending north to Todd Park and the Jay C. Hormel Nature Center. There is also a mountain biking trail, completed in 2015, that hosted a Minnesota High School Cycling League competition in its inaugural year.

Extensions to these existing non-motorized trails will connect Austin to the Blazing Star Trail (west toward Albert Lea and Myre-Big Island State Park) and the Shooting Star State Trail (east toward Rose Creek, Adams, and Leroy).

===Health care===

The Mayo Clinic Health system operates a full-service hospital and clinic in Austin, the Austin Medical Center. Both primary care and specialty care services are available locally. The campus also provides emergency and urgent care services, a complete pharmacy, and a recently expanded pediatrics department. Before joining the Mayo system, Austin Medical Center was St. Olaf Hospital.

The Hormel Institute is a medical research branch of the University of Minnesota. Established in 1942, it has become one of the world&#x27;s leading cancer research facilities. In 2016 the institute was expanded to twice its original size. Tours of the institute are available but must be arranged through Discover Austin, the local convention and visitors bureau.

By 1870, much of the land had been bought from the speculators, but crop failures in those early years resulted in many foreclosures and much of the land returned again to speculators. Clayton and Bennington are still the least populated townships of the county with 178 people each.

== School ==
Lyle Independent School District #497 serves both the city of Lyle and the surrounding farm community.

This district is merged for purposes of athletics with Austin Pacelli, a Catholic high school in Austin, Minnesota. Lyle sports teams, formerly the Lyle Lions, are now the Lyle-Pacelli Athletics. Since the district is so small, Lyle-Pacelli frequently plays against schools with much larger enrollments and plays nine-man football.

The Lyle area was engaged in a bitter fight over a school bond referendum from 2002 to 2005. Two groups emerged in the community: &quot;Save our Schools and Community&quot;, a group supporting construction of a new school, and &quot;Concerned Citizens for Lyle&#x27;s Future&quot;, a group opposing the construction of a new school in favor of other less expensive solutions. In 2005, Concerned Citizens for Lyle&#x27;s Future hired an anti-school-bond consultant from Ocheyedan, Iowa. The bond passed on May 24, 2005, by a vote of 449 to 343. In this election, 98% of eligible voters participated. The new school has been built on the site of the former facility.

===Troy===
The old town of Troy was on the Cedar River in sections 4 and 8, about eight miles (13 km) south of Austin. It was settled on March 24, 1857 by John Tift and it once had a dam, sawmill, grist mill and a hotel. It suffered the same fate as Cedar City in the spring of 1858.

===Cedar City===
John Chandler came to Lyle Township from Milton, Ontario, in 1856 and took up a claim in section 4. He later gave up his rights to his claim in favor of Caleb Stock and John Phelps. These two men, along with T.N. Stone, built a dam of stones and timber and then built a sawmill and grist mill behind it. The rains of the spring of 1858 were unusually heavy and the new dam gave way to the unexpected water levels. The dam and mills were never rebuilt, but some of the old residents of the short-lived settlement lie in rest at nearby Cedar City Cemetery.

==Cemetery==
*Woodbury Cemetery is located in the far northwest corner of the southwest quadrant of section 33 of the township near the Cedar River. It was established by J.W. Woodbury at some time before 1855 and the south section contains some Civil War soldiers.

==History==
In 1855 John L. Johnson came to the township from Wisconsin and built a sod shanty in a grove of trees in section 4 that had a large, red rock in it. This grove eventually became known as Red Rock Grove and later the whole township took its name from this area. The rock can still be seen in section 5 (about 1.5 miles northwest of Brownsdale) in the southeast corner of the land owned by Craig Bauman. The area of Red Rock Township around the town of Brownsdale was the source of much of the lumber which helped to build Mower County. Most of the wooded sections of the township were logged in the 1850s and 1860s and much that wood was cut in Brownsdale&#x27;s steam-powered sawmill, one of the town&#x27;s first permanent structures. The township is now largely treeless, with the only significant stands being along Roberts Creek and Dobbins Creek.

==History==

In 1879, Avoca was named for the village of Avoca in County Wicklow, Ireland.

A Catholic school for Native American girls ran circa 1882-1896 and later reopened in 1905 as a boys military school until it was destroyed by fire on February 12, 1910. The town&#x27;s water supply was frozen, which meant that the building was unable to be saved.

St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church suffered a fire in 1889 but was rebuilt though it is now closed and the structure torn down. Three former Lutheran churches long ago merged into Faith Evangelical Lutheran Church (ELCA), which closed in August, 2018. The nondenominational Word of Faith Fellowship, established 1983, is the only church currently in town.

A public school was built in 1894, but is no longer in use.

Avoca suffered two devastating fires, first in 1907 then again in 1952.

==Politics==
Avoca is located in Minnesota&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, represented by Regal attorney Michelle Fischbach, a Republican. At the state level, Avoca is located in Senate District 21, represented by Republican Mike Goggin, and in House District 21A, represented by Republican Barb Haley.

==End-O-Line Railroad Park &amp; Museum==

End-O-Line Park is nestled on Currie&#x27;s northern edge. Founded in 1872 by Neil and Archibald Currie, this place was thought to be the most beautiful country with the Des Moines River moving across the prairie and Lake Shetek in the west. The park is along Murray County Road 38 near Minnesota Highway 30.

The railroads were the first great achievement in transportation of the machine age. This achievement led to the expansion and growth of the West. It is this story, as well as the story of the area, that the museum tries to tell.

A model railroad display, in HO scale, is one of the museum&#x27;s highlights. It is an authentic reproduction of the Currie railroad yards as they were around the turn of the 20th century. The layout features scratch-built locomotives and structures, complete landscaping, a full wraparound mural, and complete sound effects. Visitors can hear the old steam locomotive puff and chug throughout the countryside, accented by the steam whistle, bell, and hiss of steam.

District Number One, the Sunrise School, was moved to End-O-Line Park and restored by the Murray County Historical Society. The embossed tin ceilings and walls, vertical wainscoting, recitation bench and many blackboards are typical, but the triangular sunrise worked into the front and back of the schoolhouse is unique. The one-room school with tin dinner pails, water cooler, washbasin, old world maps, bell tower and rope, ink wells, and cloakrooms brings back memories to share with children.

End-O-Line Park&#x27;s section house, originally in Comfrey, was built by Chicago and Northwestern for a section foreman and his family. A saltbox structure, the house has been restored to the early 1900 style.

==Recreation==
Currie has many outdoor activities available to the public. These include the bike trail that goes through Lake Shetek State Park, Lake Shetek, and local farmland. Just north of town, Lake Shetek is a popular vacation destination for people from all over southwest Minnesota. The lake has a population of approximately 600, and more during the summer. The Currie/Lake Shetek area has a combined population of almost 1,000 during the summer.

==History==

St. Peter was founded in 1853 by Captain William Bigelow Dodd, who claimed north of what is now Broadway Avenue. He named the new settlement Rock Bend because of the rock formation at the bend of the Minnesota River. Daniel L. Turpin platted and surveyed the town site in 1854. In 1855, a group of St. Paul businessmen interested in promoting the town formed the Saint Peter Company, and the town was renamed St. Peter. The president of the company was Willis A. Gorman, Territorial Governor of Minnesota. Many of St. Peter&#x27;s streets were named after streets in New York City, including Park Row, Chatham, Broadway, Nassau, and Union. Dodd was originally from Bloomfield, New Jersey. His second wife, Harriett Newell Jones, a native of Cabot, Vermont, was living in New York at the time of their marriage at the Church of the Holy Communion in New York City, which helped fund the church in St. Peter that shares its name.

St. Peter was located along the Minnesota River, a major tributary of the Mississippi River, and flowed down a wide valley carved by the Glacial River Warren, when it emptied Lake Agassiz. One mile north of where St. Peter was founded, was Traverse des Sioux, a trading site used by native Americans from before contact, that later became a major transhipment point for the fur trade, bringing furs from the Red River Valley and the watershed of Lake Winnipeg into the Mississippi River Valley. Traverse des Sioux had been a trading area and a ford over the Minnesota River that had been used by native Americans before the contact period. During the era of steamships, was the farthest up river that larger steam ships could operate. 

The Two Fingers band of Sioux from St Peter&#x27;s made news in 1855.

In 1857, an attempt was made to move the Territory of Minnesota&#x27;s capital from St. Paul to St. Peter. Gorman owned the land on which the bill&#x27;s sponsors wanted to build the new capitol building, and at one point had been heard saying, &quot;If the capitol remains in Saint Paul, the territory is worth millions, and I have nothing.&quot; At the time, St. Peter, in the territory&#x27;s central region, was seen as more accessible to far-flung territorial legislators than St. Paul, which was in the extreme east of the territory, on the east bank of the Mississippi River. A bill passed both houses of the Territorial Legislature and was awaiting Gorman&#x27;s signature. The chairman of the Territorial Council&#x27;s Enrolled Bills Committee, Joseph J. Rolette of Pembina, took the bill and hid in a St. Paul hotel, drinking and playing cards with some friends as the city police looked fruitlessly for him, until the end of the legislative session, too late for the bill to be signed. Rolette came into the chamber just as the session ended. Today, St. Paul is the state&#x27;s second-largest city (after neighboring Minneapolis), while St. Peter is a relatively small rural town.
In 1851 the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux was signed between the Sioux (Dakota) and the U.S. Government one mile (1.6 km) north of St. Peter. The Nicollet County Historical Society-Treaty Site History Center is near the site of the signing. But the treaty&#x27;s promises were not kept. The Dakota became angered and the Dakota War of 1862 began in Cottonwood County. In August 1862 the Dakota attacked the German settlement of New Ulm. A company of volunteers from St. Peter, headed by Dodd, St. Peter&#x27;s founder, went to New Ulm&#x27;s defense. Dodd was killed on August 23, 1862, and briefly buried in New Ulm. On November 11, 1862, Dodd was buried with high military honors in St. Peter on the grounds of the Church of the Holy Communion, Episcopal, on land he donated to the church. Dodd, his wife Harriet and two children are buried behind the present stone church built in 1869–70 at 118 North Minnesota Avenue.

In 1866, the legislature established the first &quot;Minnesota Asylum for the Insane&quot; in St. Peter. It was later known as the St. Peter State Hospital, and is now called the St. Peter Regional Treatment Center.

On July 1, 1892, the Sontag Brothers, John Sontag and George Contant, and their partner, Chris Evans, tried to rob a train between St. Peter and Kasota along the Minnesota River. The bandits acquired nothing of value, but their activities came under the review of Pinkerton detectives, and both were apprehended in June 1893 in what is called the Battle of Stone Corral in California.

===Governors===
St. Peter is known as the home of five governors:
* Territorial
** Willis Arnold Gorman (1853–1857)
* State
** Henry Adoniram Swift (1863–1864)
** Horace Austin (1870–1874)
** Andrew Ryan McGill (1887–1889)
** John Albert Johnson (1905–1909)

The best-known of these, Johnson, was born in St. Peter to Swedish-born parents on July 28, 1861. Because of family circumstances, he offered to help his mother raise the family. He left school at a young age and held a variety of jobs. In 1887, he was hired as editor of the &quot;St. Peter Herald&quot;, the local newspaper. In 1899, he was elected to the State Senate, and served until 1903. In 1904, he was elected Minnesota&#x27;s 16th governor. He was reelected in 1906 and 1908. He was considered as a possible candidate in the 1912 presidential election, but died as the result of an operation for intestinal adhesions in Rochester, Minnesota, on September 21, 1909. Drs. William James Mayo and Charles Horace Mayo, who came from Le Sueur and were friends with Johnson, performed the operation. After lying in state in the Capitol rotunda, his body was taken to St. Peter for burial. The funeral, held at Union Presbyterian Church, was St. Peter&#x27;s largest ever, and he was buried near his parents in Greenhill Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Elinore &quot;Nora&quot; Preston Johnson.

On March 29, 1998, a tornado struck St. Peter, killing six-year-old Dustin Schneider, injuring dozens more, and damaging much of the town&#x27;s housing, commercial, and civic buildings. The tornado destroyed 156 single-family houses and 51 apartment units. An additional 362 houses and apartments suffered serious damage and 1,383 houses or apartments had minor damage. The town&#x27;s three trailer parks were largely spared with no mobile homes destroyed and just two seriously damaged.

==Education==

St. Peter is the home of Gustavus Adolphus College, a private liberal arts college affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and founded in 1862. The public high school is St. Peter High School. There are two parochial schools in St. Peter: John Ireland Catholic School (K-6), which is associated with the Church of St. Peter, and St. Peter Evangelical Lutheran School (K-8), which along with the church is associated with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Veritas et Lux Preparatory School is a private non-denominational (K-12) school.

The first class graduated from St. Peter High School in 1880. The first superintendent of St. Peter Public Schools was Andrew Ryan McGill, who served from 1865 to 1868. McGill was Minnesota&#x27;s 10th governor from 1887 to 1889.

Scholarship America is based in St. Peter.

==Healthcare==
Community health care is provided by St. Peter Community Hospital. In 2009 St. Peter Community Hospital was renamed River&#x27;s Edge Hospital. That same year the construction of a new clinic was begun adjoining the hospital. There is now the River&#x27;s Edge Clinic and the St. Peter Community Clinic, part of the Mayo Health System.

St. Peter is home to the Minnesota Security Hospital, where those the state declares mentally ill and dangerous are committed.

Benedictine Health Care Center, formerly known as St. Peter Community Health Care Center, is part of the River&#x27;s Edge Hospital complex. Near the hospital Pheasants&#x27; Ridge is an assisted living facility that has a section for patients suffering from memory loss due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia. Other health care facilities in St. Peter include Grandview Good Samaritan Center on Sunrise Drive.

River Valley Birth Center opened in St. Peter in the summer of 2014. It is the region&#x27;s first free-standing birth center.

==History==

Adrian owes its birth to the St. Paul and Dakota Railroad Company, a branch of the Sioux City and St. Paul Railroad. Railroad employee O.D. Brown surveyed a 16-block town site in May 1876 and track-laying crews arrived in August of that same year. A city plat was dedicated on August 28 and filed on October 4.

===Name===

Railroad company history states that the city was named after Adrian Iselin, a large stockholder in the Sioux City and St. Paul Railroad. A copy of a portrait of Iselin&#x27;s wife, painted by John Singer Sargent, has been displayed for years in Adrian City Hall.

===Railroad era===
Adrian&#x27;s early development was largely fostered by the efforts of John Ireland, bishop of the St. Paul Roman Catholic Diocese. Through the Catholic press, he encouraged Catholics from eastern cities to come to Minnesota, and he used his personal wealth to buy land near Adrian to sell to the new arrivals. In 1877, he bought of land; seven months later he made an additional purchase of .

In 1877, 100,000 bushels of grain were shipped from the Adrian station, and the town population totaled 193 people as of 1880. By 1882 the local parish reported 250 Catholic families living in the area. The town population increased to 671 in 1890 and 1,258 in 1900. Growth slowed thereafter, as some of Adrian&#x27;s rail trade had shifted to the towns of Ellsworth, Lismore and Wilmont. In 1893, Adrian tried but failed to split Nobles County into two parts in order to become a county seat.

===St. Adrian Catholic Church===
The first St. Adrian Catholic Church was established in 1877. The building burned to the ground Christmas Eve, 1899. The young town responded by building the current church, which was completed in 1901. St. Adrian Church is on the National Register of Historic Places along with the Hotel Slade.

===Interstate highway era===
At 2:00 p.m., November 4, 1967, the section of Interstate Highway 90 passing Adrian officially opened to traffic. The previously used highway, U.S. Highway 16, passed directly through town. The by-passing of all east/west traffic forever sealed the character of Adrian as a small town.

<text>The simple squeeze is the most basic form of a squeeze in contract bridge. When declarer plays a winner in one suit (the &quot;squeeze card&quot;), an opponent is forced to discard a stopper in one of declarer&#x27;s two threat suits.

The simple squeeze takes place against one opponent only and gains one trick only. That opponent must hold the defense&#x27;s only stoppers in declarer&#x27;s two threat suits. The simple squeeze requires that declarer has rectified the count: declarer must have already lost as many tricks as he can afford, and can win all but one of the remaining tricks with top cards. Positional squeezes, described next, also require that the defense&#x27;s stoppers be located favorably for declarer. Other requirements are also discussed in this article.

==Positional squeezes==

 In Example 1, when the A is cashed, West is squeezed in the major suits. West must discard before North plays. If West discards a spade, dummy discards the K and declarer then wins the AJ. If West discards the A, dummy discards the J and declarer then wins the A and the K.

The squeeze will not work if East&#x27;s and West&#x27;s cards are swapped as shown in Example 2. Here East can wait to see which threat card is played on the A and discard accordingly; if declarer throws the J, East discards a spade, and if declarer throws the K, East discards the A. (This example assumes that West holds at least one heart after following to the A; else, South&#x27;s 2 becomes a legitimate threat and the squeeze is automatic—see the next examples.)

The &quot;positional squeeze&quot;, is so called because its success depends on the position of the threats K and J relative to the defense&#x27;s stoppers, the KQ and the A. Either the K or J, or both, must be in the upper hand: the hand that plays after the squeezed defender.
==Automatic squeezes==

 The positional squeeze which works against one defender only can be distinguished from the &quot;automatic squeeze&quot;, which works against either defender.

Consider the layout in Example 3, where the J and the K are &quot;divided between declarer and dummy&quot;. When South leads the squeeze card, the A, West is squeezed. If West discards a spade, dummy throws the 2 and declarer then wins dummy&#x27;s AJ. If West discards the A, dummy throws the J and declarer then wins the K and dummy&#x27;s A.

If the defense&#x27;s stoppers are in the East hand instead of the West hand and the North-South hands are unchanged as in Example 4, then when declarer leads the A and dummy discards the 2, East is squeezed. If East discards a spade, declarer then wins dummy&#x27;s AJ. If East discards the A, declarer then wins the K and dummy&#x27;s A.

This is still a simple squeeze, but it is termed an &quot;automatic squeeze&quot; to distinguish it from a &quot;positional squeeze&quot;. The fact that declarer&#x27;s two threats are in different hands means that no matter which defender holds both stoppers, at least one of the threats lies in the upper hand (the J if West is to be squeezed, the K if East is to be squeezed).
==Entries==
A successful simple squeeze poses several requirements. The count must be rectified, the defense&#x27;s stoppers in the threat suits must be held by one opponent only, at least one threat card must lie over the squeezed defender, and at least one threat must lie opposite the squeeze card. In addition to these requirements, one of three general types of entry positions must be present.

===The threat opposite the squeeze card has an entry in its own suit===

 Earlier, Examples 1 and 4, illustrated positional and automatic squeezes; here, they also illustrate one way to satisfy a simple squeeze&#x27;s entry requirement.

One of the threat cards is the J. It lies opposite the squeeze card (the A), and it is accompanied by an entry (the A) in its own suit. The hand containing the squeeze card must of course have another card (here, the 4) that can be used to cross to the A after the squeeze has taken place.
===Split two-card threat and twin-entry threat===
Another entry position in the simple squeeze gives dummy, for example, an immediate winner and a small card in declarer&#x27;s threat suit. This position is termed a &quot;split two-card threat&quot; or &quot;split two-card menace&quot;. The split two-card threat &quot;splits&quot; the threat between declarer&#x27;s hand and dummy.

 In Example 5, the spade threat is the J. The split two-card threat splits the spade threat&#x27;s immediate winner, the A, from the threat itself. Dummy holds an immediate winner in the suit where declarer holds the threat.

When the squeeze card, the A, is played, West might discard the A. Then dummy throws the 3 and cashes the A and the K. If West discards the Q instead, dummy throws the K. South plays the 2 to the A, removing West&#x27;s remaining K, and takes the last trick with the J.

Notice that the simple squeeze with a split two-card menace is a positional squeeze. It will not operate against East if West&#x27;s cards in Example 5 are transferred to East, as in Example 6. In Example 6, the split two-card menace is still present but if dummy discards the 3 on the A, East discards the Q and declarer must still lose to the A. If dummy instead discards the K, East throws the A and declarer must still lose to the K.

 The problem in Example 6 is that declarer does not hold an entry to the J threat after playing the squeeze card. The &quot;twin-entry threat&quot; converts the positional split-threat squeeze to an automatic squeeze. See Example 7.

Dummy holds winner-and-small in declarer&#x27;s threat suit, as with the split two-card menace in Examples 5 and 6, but now declarer also has a winner (the K) in that threat suit. This is a twin-entry squeeze and is automatic: with these cards in North and South, either West or East could be squeezed.

In Example 7, declarer leads A and dummy follows suit. If East discards a spade, declarer wins the A, the K and the 9. If East discards the A, declarer wins the K, the A and the K. The same sequence occurs if West instead of East holds the guards in spades and hearts.
===The criss-cross squeeze===

The third general type of entry position in the simple squeeze occurs when declarer has an entry in dummy&#x27;s threat suit and dummy has an entry in declarer&#x27;s threat suit. This situation is termed a &quot;criss-cross squeeze&quot;. It is regarded as a comparatively rare position.

 Example 8 illustrates the criss-cross squeeze. Dummy&#x27;s threat card is the Q and declarer has an entry, the A, in that suit. Declarer&#x27;s threat card is the Q and dummy has an entry, the A, in that suit. When declarer cashes the A, East is squeezed. South cashes the A in whichever suit East discards from, crosses to the other A, and cashes the remaining Q.

This is an automatic squeeze: it works regardless of which opponent guards the two threats. However, the position is usually ambiguous. After the squeeze has taken place, declarer is often uncertain which guard (in Example 8, the K and the K) is now a singleton.

For example, if East unguarded the K earlier in the play, the situation might actually be as shown in Example 9. In this case, declarer cashes the A and East throws a small heart. If declarer now judges that East has bared the K, he will cash the A. When the K does not fall, declarer will subsequently be stuck in dummy, losing the final trick to the K. A similar outcome can result if East bares the K early in the play.

The possibility of this sort of ambiguity is inherent in the blocked entry position that characterizes criss-cross squeezes. A defender who can see what&#x27;s coming can discard deceptively, putting declarer to a guess after the squeeze has matured.
==The Vienna coup==
 One particular entry configuration may require special handling. In the layout shown in Example 10, the threats (J and Q) are divided between the North and South hands and East holds the guards in the threat suits. Furthermore, North holds a winner in each threat suit and South holds no winner in either threat suit.

Suppose that South leads the squeeze card, the A, in the position shown. East simply discards either heart, because the South hand can neither retain nor regain the lead, and the North hand must eventually lose the J to the K.

The solution is to unblock the A before leading to the A. After the unblock, the position is as shown in Example 11. The unblock of the A transposes Example 10 into Example 11, a simple automatic squeeze with the Q positioned to exert pressure against East. Compare Example 11 with Example 4, which shows the same basic position.

The unblocking solution remains the same even if the East and West hands were interchanged.

The play, prior to the squeeze card, of the winner that blocks South&#x27;s threat is called the &quot;Vienna coup&quot;. The term has long been regarded as unduly connoting brilliance: &quot;In short, the aura of glamor which has always seemed to surround this play is wholly fictitious.&quot;

<text>Bigelow is a city in Nobles County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 235 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The town of Bigelow is located in southcentral Nobles County in section 31 of Bigelow Township. The southern corporate limit of the town is defined by the Iowa border.

Main highway is:
* Minnesota State Highway 60
Other important transportation:
*Union Pacific Railroad

==History==

Beginnings: The town of Bigelow was the third community to come into existence in Nobles County. The first two were Worthington and Brewster. All three towns appeared on the map in 1871, though Bigelow remained nothing more than that - a spot on a map - until the spring of 1872, when the tracks of the St. Paul &amp; Sioux City Railway reached the site of the present-day town. Throughout the summer of 1872, the site was occupied only by a large tent which furnished shelter for the construction crew. A railroad depot was constructed in September 1872, and Mr. S. O. Morse assumed duties as station agent. He went into partnership with a man named Frothingham, and the two established a small grocery store in the depot. This was the only business established in 1872.

Source of name: Even before railroad tracks had reached present-day Bigelow, the town&#x27;s future name had been decided. It was named after Charles H. Bigelow. He was also a director of the St. Paul &amp; Sioux City Railway, and the board decided to flatter him by naming a new town after him. Bigelow Township was also named after Mr. Bigelow. There is no record of Charles Bigelow visiting the town that bears his name, though it is likely he passed through on the railroad that he helped to create.

Incorporation: The townsite was platted and a dedication was made on September 24, 1873. Two new business came to town in 1873. S. D. Tinnes opened a general merchandise store and John DeBoos and John Colvin opened a hardware store. A grain dealer, a lumber yard, and a coal business were established in 1874. A school house was also built in that year and began that fall with 24 students. The village grew slowly. The 1880 census gave Bigelow a population of only 28. (One must assume that many of the 24 students enrolled in the Bigelow school resided on farms outside of the village.) Charles L. Davidson, of Hull, Iowa, purchased the townsite on January 25, 1892, and decided to &quot;boom the town&quot;, or attract investment and settlers. His efforts apparently paid off, for by 1894, Bigelow claimed 150 residents. A census taken on November 16, 1899, counted 224 residents. On February 13, 1900, an election was held, and by a vote of 37 to 6 it was decided that the time had come for municipal government. The first president of Bigelow was a Mr. W. C. Wyatt.

Bigelow today: According to the 2010 census, Bigelow has a population of 235. Perhaps a half-dozen businesses exist in the town. In recent years, Minnesota State Highway 60, which once passed directly through town, was widened to four-lanes, and bypassed Bigelow entirely. Bigelow does not have a public school. Children attend school either in nearby Worthington or in Ellsworth. Minnesota&#x27;s open-enrollment law gives them this option.

* Nobles County Road 14

==History==

Founding of Brewster: The town of Brewster was in established in the spring of 1872, but was known for many years as Hersey. It was the first town established in Nobles County by the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad, and was named after General Samuel F. Hersey, a lumber baron from Maine, and one of the railroad&#x27;s directors. The first resident was W. R. Bennett, who came to take charge of the railroad station. T. J. Smith put up the first store which was run by A. J. Timlin for many years. Mr. A. O. Conde established a lumber yard and a grain business, Martin Heiser opened a second store, a hotel was opened by a Mr. Humphrey, and John Iverson established a blacksmith shop. All of this occurred in 1872, the same year that A. J. Timlin became postmaster.

Source of name: In 1880, the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad was purchased by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway, or the Omaha Road, and there was already a station named Hersey on the latter road&#x27;s track in Wisconsin. In order to avoid confusion, the name of Hersey was changed, briefly to Nobles County Station. Soon thereafter, the name Brewster was settled upon. There is some confusion regarding the choice of name. E. F. Drake, president of the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad once stated that the name &quot;was changed to Brewster after a director of the Omaha Road.&quot; But a brochure later put out by the Chicago and North Western Railway Company stated that &quot;the present name was given in honor of Brewster, a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, which was named in honor of Elder William Brewster, one of the first settlers of Plymouth Colony.&quot;

Incorporation: By the fall of 1898, it was found that 180 people lived in the community of Brewster. Thus it was decided that the time had come for incorporation. An election was held on December 14, 1898, and out of the 28 ballots cast, only one was opposed to idea of municipal government. On January 9, 1899, Leon Morris assumed duties as the first president of Brewster Village.

He was also named postmaster when a post office was established on November 1, 1879. It was at this time that the name was changed to Dundee, after the city of Dundee, Scotland. The reason for the name change is lost to history, although it is known that stationmaster/postmaster G. Foils (whose first name is also lost to history) made the change. A Scottish Company known as the Dundee Improvement Company was then financing construction of an elevator, general store, and hotel in nearby Kinbrae, and perhaps Mr. Foils thought he could attract investment in Dundee. The first business was opened in the spring of 1880 by F. D. Lindquist and H. A. Scherlie. Several homes were also built in that second year, but real growth for Dundee did not occur until the late-nineties when the country began to recover from the Panic of 1893. A census taken on December 23, 1897, gave the village a population of 187. At this time, citizens petitioned for incorporation, and on January 4, 1898, the county commissioners granted their request. A special election was held on February 15, and on March 11, 1898, the Dundee council met for the first time. F. D. Lindquist was named village president.

<text>Ellsworth is a city in Nobles County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 497 at the 2020 census. The local school district is the Ellsworth Public School.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. It is located in Grand Prairie Township in the far southwestern corner of Nobles County.

Main highways include: 
* Minnesota State Highway 91
* Nobles County Road 6

==History==

Early history: Ellsworth is located in Grand Prairie Township in the extreme southwestern corner of Nobles County. The township was organized in 1873, though settlers had taken up residence in the township as early as 1871. One of these early settlers is known in history only as &quot;Uncle&quot; Stillwell. Mr Stillwell made a claim to the land where Ellsworth now stands, and he established a small store on his farmstead, supplying the needs of local farmers. He also operated a peddler&#x27;s wagon in the vicinity. Mr. Stillwell had great confidence in the future of the region, and often remarked that a town would one day be located on his property, or very near to it. However, Stillwell packed up and left the area two years before the town of Ellsworth was eventually established in 1884. Ellsworth sits on Stillwell&#x27;s former claim, and the business district of the town is located less than 1/2 mile west of Stillwell&#x27;s cabin.

A new railroad town: The town of Ellsworth was named in honor of Eugene Ellsworth of Cedar Falls, Iowa, and came into existence as a result of construction of the Burlington Railroad in the summer of 1884. The site was selected by agents of the Cedar Rapids, Iowa &amp; Northwestern Land &amp; Town Lot Company. The site was surveyed by F. D. Randall, and dedication of the plat was made on September 29, 1884, by S. L. Dows and James B. Close, president and secretary, respectively, of the town lot company. When the rail line was completed, a box car was set off to the side, and this served as a depot until a more substantial structure could be built. The first structure in town was a saloon completed by Sam Stevens and Phil Lattenberger in September 1884. Construction of a dozen or more buildings were started at this same time, and before the close of the year, the booming town had about 150 inhabitants. During the winter of 1884–85, the Ellsworth postoffice was established with B. F. Garmer as postmaster.

In the early fall of 1886, the town was selected as a division point of the Burlington railroad. The company built a five-stall roundhouse, put in a turntable, erected a substantial depot, and built a branch line from Ellsworth to Rock Rapids, Iowa.

Incorporation: The necessary steps were taken to bring about incorporation at a county board meeting held in Worthington on December 10, 1886. An election was held on January 13, 1887, and municipal government began in February. The census of 1890 gave Ellsworth a population of 258. The population in 2000 was 540.

==History==
Organization of Graham Lakes Township was approved by the Nobles County Board on April 11, 1871. The first township meeting occurred April 21, 1871. The township was named for East Graham Lake and West Graham Lake which are entirely within the township&#x27;s borders. These lakes were first noted on Joseph Nicollet&#x27;s 1842 map based upon his explorations of the late 1830s and early 1840s. Nicollet named the lakes after Joseph Duncan Graham. Graham served as a commissioner for the survey of the northeast segment of the boundary between the United States and Canada from 1840 until 1843.

In the month of May, 1867, a pioneer named Stephen Muck pushed out into the unsettled Graham Lakes region and squatted on land on the bank of West Graham Lake. When surveyed, this land proved to be on section 22 of Graham Lakes Township. There he built a log structure from timber growing near the lake, the first house of wood in the county. In the fall of 1867, Muck brought his family from Jackson County, Minnesota. He earned his livelihood by trapping for a few years, then turned to farming. He lived continuously on his farm from 1867 until the time of his death in 1897. Stephen Muck was the very first permanent resident of Nobles County.

The first town to appear on any map of Nobles County was a curious place called Gretchtown. According to an 1856 map - a map drawn 11 years before the arrival of Stephen Muck - Gretchtown was located on the south bank of West Graham Lake, very near to Muck&#x27;s claim. Rumors of a railroad to be built through southwestern Minnesota had circulated in the 1850s, and even though no survey had been taken for the railroad, the town of Gretchtown had been created - at least on paper - to serve as a stopping point. When Nobles County was formally created by the Minnesota legislature on May 23, 1857, Gretchtown was briefly designated as the county seat of Nobles County, a county at that time without any residents.

When a route for the St. Paul and Sioux City Railway was surveyed in 1871, it was located far south of the Graham Lakes region. No towns or villages existed in Graham Lakes Township until 1879 when Kinbrae and Dundee were established. Neither town grew beyond a few hundred residents. Thus, the Graham Lakes region has remained entirely rural, and the lake shores of both East Graham Lake and West Graham Lake remain undeveloped.

<text>Grand Prairie Township is a township in Nobles County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 9,925 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all land. The main geographic features of Grand Prairie Township include the numerous branches of the Norwegian Creek that extend throughout much of the township. The main branch of the Kanaranzi Creek also flows through the northwest corner Grand Prairie Township.

Main highways include: 
* Minnesota State Highway 91
* Nobles County Road 6
* Nobles County Road 8

==History==
Organization of Grand Prairie Township was approved by the Nobles County Board on September 22, 1873, though settlers has taken up root in the township as early as 1871. The first township meeting was held on October 30, 1873. There were originally three names proposed for the new township: Colfax, Grand Prairie, and Union Township. The Nobles County Board liked Grand Prairie Township best, and that is why the name was chosen. Grand Prairie Township is in the extreme southwestern corner of Nobles County. One of the first settlers of Grand Prairie Township is known in history only as &quot;Uncle&quot; Stillwell. Mr Stillwell made a claim in section 29 where the town of Ellsworth now stands. He established a small store on his farmstead, supplying the needs of local farmers. He also operated a peddler&#x27;s wagon in the vicinity. Mr. Stillwell had great confidence in the future of the region. However, Stillwell packed up and left the area in 1882, two years before the town of Ellsworth was established.

The picture above is a homestead certificate issued to Alphonso Hall in 1882 and signed by President Chester A Arthur. This Homestead certificate is for a parcel of land in the southwest quarter of Section 34. In December 1871, the state of Minnesota granted all odd numbered sections of land extending along the proposed right-of-way of the St. Paul &amp; Sioux City Railway Company to that company. This was the so-called &quot;ten-mile limit&quot; extending for on either side of any rail line planned by a railroad company. Even-numbered sections had been retained by the government for homestead or for sale to actual settlers. Alphonso Hall and his family are listed on the 1880 Federal Census roster for Grand Prairie township, though not on the 1875 census.

<text>Indian Lake Township is a township in Nobles County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 259 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (3.75%) is water. The major geographic features in the township include Indian Lake much of East Lake Ocheda, and a small portion of Iowa Lake.

Main highways include:
* Minnesota State Highway 264
* Nobles County Road 3
* Nobles County Road 4
* Nobles County Road 5

==History==
Organization of Indian Lake Township was approved by the Nobles County Board on April 22, 1871. The township was named for the lake within its borders. The lake was named Indian Lake due to the fact that settlers found Native Americans encamped along the lake&#x27;s shores when they first arrived in 1869. A dozen years earlier, a band of Indians led by Inkpaduta, the group responsible for the 1857 Spirit Lake Massacre, lived along the shores of the lake. Indeed, the women and children of Inkpaduta&#x27;s band were camped at Indian Lake when the massacre was taking place. Inkpaduta later fled westward, joining up with the Lakotas. He became a close friend of Sitting Bull, and participated in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the defeat of George Armstrong Custer. It is believed that Inkpaduta died in Canada in 1881 or 1882.

Issac Horton, a pioneer settler, was the first to take up permanent residence along the shores of Indian Lake. He had been renting a farm near Spirit Lake, Iowa and frequently came to the Indian Lake region to hunt elk. On May 6, 1869, he filed a preemption claim to the eastern half of section 34 of Indian Lake Township. His claim included the eastern shore of Indian Lake. He erected a cabin of logs cut from his claim, and resided there for 17 years. Horton eventually sold his claim and purchased the southwest quarter of Indian Lake Township section 22 where he resided until his death in 1892.

Other early settlers in Indian Lake Township included Ole Fauskee and his family. Ole migrated from Norway to the United States in 1867 when he was 25 years old. He was travelling through southwest Minnesota with his brother when his ox team gave out. He liked the country he saw, and on June 8, 1870, he and his brother walked all the way to Jackson, Minnesota, to file claims. Ole Fauskee claimed the northwest quarter of section 6 of Indian Lake Township, and his brother made an adjacent claim. Fauskee erected a sod hut on the banks of East Lake Ocheda and lived there for five years. He also claimed the northeast quarter of section 12 of Bigelow Township. Fauskee eventually built a home of lumber there, and prospered as a farmer.

<text>Kinbrae ( ) is a city in Nobles County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 10 at the 2020 census, making the city the least populous incorporated place in Minnesota.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The town is located in the far northeastern corner of Nobles County. Kinbrae lies one mile west of Jackson County, and one mile south of Murray County.

Main highway:
* Nobles County Road 1

==History==

Site selections: In the year 1879, the Southern Minnesota Railroad began building a route from Heron Lake, to Fulda. A rail station was proposed for the Graham Lakes region, and the site selected was briefly named Airlie in honor of David Ogilvy, the 10th Earl of Airlie. The Earl was president of the Dundee Improvement company, a Scottish company formed for the purpose of founding a town in southwest Minnesota. In September and October 1879, Oglivy&#x27;s company built a steam elevator with a capacity of 16,000 bushels, a hotel, and a general store building in Airlie. The Dundee Improvement company played no role in founding the nearby town of Dundee. In fact, the towns of Kinbrae (Airlie) and Dundee, though separated by a mere 1/2 mile, were rivals, built along the roads of competing rail lines.

Change of name: When the site was surveyed in December 1879, Airlie was formally rechristened DeForest. A depot and a post office were both constructed in 1880 even though the census showed a mere 19 residents. The depot was known as DeForest Station, but the post office was known as Airlie until January 1882 when the name was formally changed to DeForest. The steam elevator was wiped out by fire on April 20, 1883, and this spelled the end of the Dundee Improvement Company&#x27;s involvement. As a historical footnote, David Ogilvy&#x27;s granddaughter Clementine Hozier was married to Winston Churchill from 1908 until his death in 1965.

Kinbrae: In August 1883, DeForest Station, the townsite, and the post office were renamed Kinbrae. Little is known about the name Kinbrae, other than that it is Scottish. Ownership of Kinbrae passed into the hands of Hanson &amp; Graeger, a Chicago land-colonization firm, but the company showed little interest in development of the new town. The townsite was then sold to W. N. Bickley and W. E. Fletcher in 1895, who made great efforts &quot;to boom the town,&quot; or to attract businesses and residents. By 1896, Kinbrae boasted two general stores, a hardware store, a lumber yard, two elevators, a blacksmith shop, a hotel, a bank, a creamery, two churches (Methodist and Presbyterian), and a school.

Incorporation: The town was incorporated on February 17, 1896, and the first village president was a Mr. L. F. Miller. The census of 1900 gave Kinbrae a population of 137. Kinbrae&#x27;s post office was discontinued in the year 1971, and by the year 2000, the town had a mere 21 residents. Population estimates from 2007 put the number of residents at 17. Kinbrae citizens briefly considered disincorporation in the year 2010, but elected to remain a municipality however small.

==History==
Organization of Larkin Township was approved by the Nobles County Board on March 27, 1883. It was the last of Nobles County&#x27;s townships to be organized.

The township was named for John Larkin, late brother-in-law of county commissioner Maurice O&#x27;Hearn (and brother of Ann Larkin O&#x27;Hearn). The rationale at the time centered on the supposedly pivotal role John Larkin had played in supporting Bishop John Ireland&#x27;s Catholic colonization efforts in southwestern Minnesota; however, little evidence exists that Larkin played any major role.

Main highways include:
* Nobles County Road 19

==History==
The town of Leota was named after Leota Township in which it is located. The story has it that Leota was the name of a young Indian woman who figured in a romantic story familiar to W. G. Barnard, one of the township&#x27;s first residents. However existence of such a story cannot be verified. If true, Leota Township (and the town of Leota) are the only place names in all of Nobles County that memorialize specific Native Americans. The town of Leota is situated on sections 5 and 8 of the township. Leota was established in 1891 as a settlement of Dutch Farmers who migrated northward from another Dutch Settlement in Orange City, Iowa. The first building erected in Leota was the Dutch Reformed Church. Later in 1891, John DeBoer, Nick DeBoer, and James TenCate erected a second building that became Leota&#x27;s first general store. A post office was established in 1893, and the Christian Reformed Church was built in 1898. The town was surveyed by M. S. Smith for James TenCate, and the plat was dedicated on January 1, 1902. Leota was never incorporated, though it remains a thriving community. The U. S. Census Bureau classifies Leota as a census-designated place (CDP). CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble incorporated places.

==History==

The town of Lismore was named after Lismore Township which, in turn, was named after a village in County Waterford, Ireland, noted for its beautiful castle. The name for Lismore Township was suggested by Father C. J. Knauf of Adrian.

Lismore owes its existence to the building of the Burlington Railroad through northeast Nobles County. The railroad established the towns of Reading and Wilmont in 1899. When the railroad reached present-day Lismore at 3:00 pm on Saturday, June 9, 1900, construction of the town immediately commenced.

The first business on site was the St. Croix Lumber company which sold its wares from a tent pitched next to a large pile of lumber hauled in from Wilmont. The first building in town was built by James Beacom and was used as a saloon. The second building in town was the O. B. Bratager store building. James Montgomery started a small grain elevator, and James Ramage opened a lumber yard and hardware store under the management of Arch Priest. The Bank of Lismore opened its doors on September 1, 1900, and was incorporated as the State Bank of Lismore three months later. A livery stable, a butcher shop, a restaurant, and a blacksmith shop were also opened in that first year. A school house, churches, several businesses, and many residences were constructed in 1901.

On December 6, 1901, the Lismore Leader was able to boast:

&quot;Lismore, for a place only a little over one year old, has made good and substantial growth... Lismore has one bank, two general merchants, one furniture store, two saloons, two pool rooms, two lumber yards, three elevators, four coal dealers, one hotel, one hardware store, two machinery firms, one blacksmith shop, one livery stable, one dray line, and one newspaper.&quot;

A census taken on April 10, 1902, showed a population of 186. The town was quickly incorporated, and its first municipal council meeting took place on June 17, 1902, with Emil Graf selected as president. Lismore&#x27;s population in the 2000 census was 238.

Lismore, Minnesota was a course in &quot;Need for Speed: The Run&quot;.

However, a wealthy Chicago Board of Trade operator named Mr. O. H. Roche donated of land for a townsite, and it was his wish that it be called Round Lake. Mr. Roche owned nearly of land on nearby Round Lake in Jackson County, and he was apparently fond of the name Round Lake. A town was platted in December 1882 and the site was divided into 100 lots, not one of which were sold. Only two buildings were built in that first year, and both were constructed by the railroad. The railroad section foreman and his crew were the only residents of the new town, until October 1883 when E. A. Tripp came to town to assume duties as station agent. A post office named Indian Lake was established in March 1884, and Mr. Tripp became the postmaster. When another post office with the name Round Lake (located on Round Lake in Jackson County) was closed, the post office in the town of Round Lake assumed the name of that town. A few businesses moved to town, but by 1887, the town had a mere 34 residents. In 1889, the town was re-platted, correcting some legal issues with the original plat, and real growth began. Nine years later, Round Lake boasted numerous businesses, a bank, a newspaper, and 179 residents. Residents voted to incorporate the town, and on October 11, 1898, the first election was held, and town government began under President A. F. Diehn. A new $2,000 school was erected at this time.

==History==

The founding of Rushmore: The city was named for S.M. Rushmore, an early pioneer. The town owes its existence to the construction of the Worthington and Sioux Falls Railway, and the desire of a New York capitalist to establish a land colonization scheme in southwestern Minnesota. When the Worthington and Sioux Falls Railway was initially surveyed, it was decided to construct a station house in section 19 of Dewald Township. The station house was Named Miller Station, in honor of ex-governor Stephen Miller, and for two years it had no inhabitants. In 1878, George I. Seney, a New York capitalist, secured control of large plots of railroad land in Dewald and Olney Townships. He immediately began the process of colonizing the lands, bringing out settlers from New York City and other eastern points. On May 27, 1878, a Mr. S. M. Rushmore arrived in Worthington along with his family, and immediately took a train for Miller Station. There he established a store to serve Mr. Seney&#x27;s flood of colonists. A railroad depot was also constructed, and the town was surveyed and platted. In August 1878, the town was renamed Rushmore in honor of the pioneer shopkeeper, and the community grew rapidly. Indeed, a business directory from the fall of 1879 shows that Rushmore had a general store, a feed mill, an elevator, a hotel, a hardware store, a grocer, a lumber agent, a tinware dealer, a notion store, a jeweler, and two blacksmiths. The town also had a new church and a new school. On March 27, 1900, Rushmore, with a population of 204, was incorporated. Village government promptly began under President S. B. Bedford.

<text>Summit Lake Township is a township in Nobles County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 368 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 36.2 square miles (93.6 km), all land. The main geographic feature of Summit Lake Township is the Buffalo Ridge, a drainage divide between the Mississippi and Missouri River systems. Other geographic features include the Kanaranzi Creek, which flows westward to the Missouri River via the Big Sioux River, and the Jack Creek, which flows eastward to the Mississippi River via the Des Moines River. Summit Lake once existed in section 11 of the township, but was drained in subsequent years. If the lake existed today, it would have the highest elevation of any body of water within the state of Minnesota.

Main highways include:
* Minnesota State Highway 264
(Discontinued - renamed Nobles County Road 25)
* Nobles County Road 25

==History==
Organization of Summit Township was approved by the Nobles County Board on May 20, 1873. The first township meeting was held on June 5, 1873. The original name of the township was Wilson Township. However, the county board was informed by the state auditor&#x27;s office that another Wilson Township existed elsewhere in the state. The township was briefly renamed Akin Township on June 15, 1874, but once again, the county was informed that another Akin Township existed within the state. On July 27, 1874, the township was given its present name of Summit Lake Township in honor of a lake in section 11 of the township. Presently, two Wilson Townships currently exist within Minnesota, one in Cass County and the other in Winona County. There is no Akin Township anywhere within the state.

<doc id="120995" wikidata="Q1007040" url="?curid=120995" title="Wilmont, Minnesota">
<text>Wilmont is a city in Nobles County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 339 at the 2010 census.
== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. By elevation, Wilmont is the highest incorporated community in Nobles County.

Main highways include:
* Minnesota State Highway 266
: (Discontinued in 2003—renamed Nobles County Road 25)
* Nobles County Road 25
* Nobles County Road 16
* Nobles County Road 13

== History ==

The town of Wilmont was established in 1899. The town was named in a roundabout way after the township in which it was located.

Willmont Township (note the double-L) was established in 1878. There was a general disagreement over the township name, one faction wishing to call it Willumet, and the other favoring Lamont. On November 22, 1878, a compromise was reached, and the township was formally named Willmont.

For twenty-one years, the residents of Willmont Township lacked convenient railroad transport. That all changed in the summer of 1899 when the Burlington Railway surveyed a new route extending northwest from Worthington. Railroad right-of-way man Thomas H. Brown selected a site for a new town and named it Wilmont. He made a point of spelling the new town with one L to distinguish it from Willmont Township. The railroad was completed on December 16, 1899, and hundreds of newcomers soon took up residence.

The survey was made, and the plat was dedicated on January 22, 1900. A Post Office was established on February 13, 1900. In April 1900, the first saloon was established in Wilmont by the Stuntebeck Brothers. Construction of a new school was approved in September 1900 with the school opening two years later. When the town celebrated its first birthday in December 1900, the town boasted two churches (Presbyterian and Catholic), three saloons, and nearly two dozen other businesses. The date and reason for Willmont Township&#x27;s name change from Willmont (double-L) to Wilmont (single-L) remains obscure.

Minnesota State Highway 266 was constructed in 1949, connecting Worthington, Reading, and Wilmont. Responsibility for this highway was transferred to Nobles County in 2003. It has been renamed Nobles County Road 25. The Burlington Railway later was taken over by the Rock Island Railroad. This line was closed, and the tracks torn up, in the 1970s.

Wilmont once boasted both public and Catholic schools. However, the town&#x27;s last school closed in the 1970s. Children are currently bused to schools in Worthington, Adrian, or Fulda. Minnesota&#x27;s open-enrollment law allows Wilmont residents this choice.

Despite having no school, railroad, or state highway connection, Wilmont remains a thriving community of 332 residents. As in 1900, life in Wilmont revolves around the town&#x27;s churches and saloons.

==History==
Organization of Willmont Township (note the double-L) was approved by the Nobles County Board on November 12, 1878. There was a general disagreement over the township name, one faction wishing to call it Willumet, and the other favoring Lamont. On November 22, 1878, a compromise was reached, and the township was formally named Willmont. When the town of Wilmont was established in 1899, one L was dropped to distinguish it from Willmont Township. Somewhere along the line, the township name was also changed to Wilmont (single-L). The reason for this change remains obscure.

<text>Ada ( ) is a city in Norman County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,740 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat.

Minnesota State Highways 9 and 200 are two of the main routes in the city.

==History==
Ada was laid out in 1874 and incorporated on February 9, 1881. It was named in honor of a daughter of William H. Fisher (the namesake of Fisher, Minnesota), of St. Paul, then attorney and superintendent of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, under whose superintendency this line of the Red River Valley was constructed. A post office has been in operation at Ada since 1876. As Norman County grew in the 1880s, they were outgrowing their current space being used as a county courthouse in Ada, and erecting a new building was on the horizon. At the time, Norman County was bigger than today, with Twin Valley roughly at the geographic center. Starting in 1900, Twin Valley worked to rally support behind the goal of building the new courthouse there, turning it into the county seat as well. Two petitions and one vote later, Ada won the challenge. In 1906, it became a moot point when Mahnomen County was formed, shrinking Norman County and making Ada the geographic center.

<text>Halstad is a city in Norman County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 564 at the time of the 2020 census. The city is known for its production of sugar beets, and has a statue of a sugar beet, known as the world&#x27;s largest sugar beet, to commemorate this status.

==History==
The town of Halstad came into being on Sept. 23rd, 1883, when the railroad was extended to it. It was platted for C.G. Comstock and wife and A.A. White and wife on that date. It appeared to the majority most fitting to use the same name for the town as had been adopted for its post office - hence the name Halstad was adopted. This was moved into town in 1884 from Ole Halstad&#x27;s rural home. Less than a year after Halstad became a town, the construction of a school within the village was begun.

The city&#x27;s unofficial motto is &quot;You Can&#x27;t Beet Halstad,&quot; based on its prominent crop, the sugar beet. In 2020, the town founded Sugar Beet Park, featuring a sculpture of the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Sugar Beet&quot; created by artist Josh Porter and formed around the base of a concrete mixer truck drum.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The Highway 200 bridge that crosses the Red River was replaced in the late 1990s, after constant flooding found it under water and impassable. Directly across the Red River on the north side of Highway 200, a small pond called Grandin Lake has provided the only close example of a freshwater ecosystem that is not a river. The table top topography of this region is impressive. There are regions of the Red River that have a one-inch change in elevation per mile.

<text>Eyota ( ) is a city in Olmsted County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,977 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Eyota was platted in 1864. The name Eyota is derived from the Dakota word &quot;iyótaŋ&quot;, meaning &quot;greatest&quot; or &quot;most&quot;. A post office has been in operation at Eyota since 1864. The city was incorporated on February 16, 1875.

Settlers had begun arriving in the area and staking claims in 1854. The earliest, Benjamin Bear, initially came in 1853 to choose a prime site with an ever-flowing spring, then returned the following year with his family. A stream called Bear Creek starts from this spring. (Today Chester Woods Lake is formed around a portion of Bear Creek that was held back behind a dam built to protect nearby Rochester from flooding.)

In the early years Eyota was an important destination for business travelers and mail, and shipping point for locally raised grain and cattle. It was located only a mile from a wye with rail extensions going north to Plainview and south to Chatfield, making Eyota a stopping point for travelers on their way to other places. (Daily trains to Chatfield and Plainview left from the Eyota depot.) The railroad was an important local employer, The railroad later became the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway.

Eyota streets were laid out on the farmland of Milo Matteson by investor Samuel E. Everett, a speculator from New York State. A downtown district, built only on the south side of the street, faced the busy railroad yard. A large hotel, frequented by business travelers, called the Everett House, was located along this street (South Front Street).

Charles P. Russell, another early investor, built a store on the corner of South Front Street and Center Avenue in 1865. Russell continued living in the community (whereas Mr. Everett soon moved on). He built a fine two-story home and bought grain from local farmers with his business partner O.H. Jackson. Years later, in 1910, Charles Russell partnered in the banking and mercantile businesses with his son, Fred Russell.

A whole line of stores flanked on the ends by the C.P Russell building and the Everett House faced the railroad depot and yard to the north. Establishments included hardware, lumber, wagon and harness makers, livery, drug store, general mercantile, hotels and several saloons.

Doctor Augustus Stinchfield was Eyota&#x27;s first medical doctor, who came to town after Eyota druggist E.D. Dyar invited him to visit. Both Stinchfield and Dyar once lived in Strong, Maine. Dr. Stinchfield built up an extensive practice, having another office in nearby St. Charles and using part of his home as a hospital. Stinchfield married Martha Bear, the daughter of early settler Benjamin Bear. He arrived in 1873 and left in 1892 when the Mayos from Rochester convinced him to become the first non-family member to partner in their practice.

Dr. Rollo C. Dugan, the son of local settler Elijah Dugan, followed Stinchfield&#x27;s local practice. He built the Eyota Hospital, an eight-bed facility on Second Street in 1900.

<text>Rochester is a city in and the county seat of Olmsted County, Minnesota, United States. It is located along rolling bluffs on the Zumbro River&#x27;s south fork in Southeast Minnesota. At the 2020 census, the city had a population of 121,395, making it Minnesota&#x27;s third-most populous city. The Rochester metropolitan area, which also includes the nearby rural agricultural areas, had a population of 226,329 in 2020. The city is the home and birthplace of Mayo Clinic.

==History==
Several indigenous peoples such as Dakota, Ojibway, and Winnebago inhabited the Rochester area. The area developed as a stagecoach stop between Saint Paul, Minnesota, and Dubuque, Iowa near the Zumbro River. The community was founded by George Head and his wife Henrietta who built a log cabin named Head&#x27;s Tavern in 1854 and named the city after his hometown of Rochester, New York. When the Winona and St Peter Railroad initiated service in October 1864, it brought new residents and business opportunities and spurred growth. In 1863, William W. Mayo arrived as the examining surgeon for Union draftees in the Civil War.

===St. Marys Hospital===

On August 21, 1883, the Great Tornado demolished much of Rochester, leaving 37 dead and approximately 200 injured. As there was no medical facility in the immediate area at the time, Mayo and his two sons worked together to care for the wounded. Donations of US$60,000 (US$1,932,562 in 2022) were collected and the Sisters of St. Francis, assisted by Mayo, opened a new facility named St. Marys Hospital in 1889.

==Geography==
Rochester lies alongside the South Fork of the Zumbro River which is long and is ringed by gentle hills and largely surrounded by farmland within a deciduous forest biome. The Zumbro Watershed flows through of agricultural and urban lands. Located in southeast Minnesota, the City of Rochester lies at the western edge of the Driftless Area, a region that was never glaciated and contains deeply-carved river valleys. The rugged terrain is due both to the lack of glacial deposits, or drift, and to the incision of the upper Mississippi River and its tributaries into bedrock. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which of it is land and is water. The city is located southeast of Minneapolis–Saint Paul.

Rochester is in Olmsted County, one of only four counties in Minnesota without a natural lake. Artificial lakes exist in the area, including Silver Lake, a dammed portion of the South Fork Zumbro River just below the convergence with Silver Creek near the city center. Silver Lake was once used as a cooling pond when the coal-burning power plant was operated by Rochester Public Utilities at the lake. When operational, the RPU coal plant&#x27;s heated water output prevented the lake from generally freezing over during the winter months, attracting large numbers of migrating giant Canada geese. Large murders of crows are known to flock to Rochester during winter, including the Rochester cemetery downtown.

Rochester has an extensive parks system, the largest of which are Silver Lake and Soldiers Field in the central part of the city. A major flood in 1978 led the city to embark on an expensive and successful flood-control project that involved altering many nearby rivers and streams. The Zumbro River flowing through the center of the city is presently being readdressed for increased development and use as part of city planning in conjunction with funding from the Destination Medical Center project.

===Climate===
With a slightly higher altitude and without the UHI as the Twin Cities, the climate is warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) even being further south, with warm summers and cold winters. The city features four distinct seasons. Rochester sees on average of rainfall and of snowfall per year. Significant snow accumulation is common during the winter months. Spring and fall are transitional seasons, with a general warming trend during the spring and a general cooling trend during the fall. However, it is not uncommon to see some snowfall during the early month of spring and the later month of fall. Rochester is the second windiest city in the United States, with wind speeds averaging . January to April are the windiest months on average, according to The Weather Channel. Rochester has been hit by two F4 tornadoes since 1950 (the first on May 10, 1953, and the other on September 16, 1962). The city has also been hit by two tornadoes in the past decade. On June 17, 2010, a tornado hit the city&#x27;s northwest side, damaging or destroying several homes and businesses around the Lincolnshire neighborhood. Another tornado struck the city on June 4, 2019, causing damage to parts of Southwest Rochester.

The clinic&#x27;s many facilities, along with hotels, restaurants and retail stores, comprise nearly all of the city&#x27;s downtown. Excluding the state government, Mayo Clinic is the largest employer in Minnesota. Other care providers, including the Rochester Federal Medical Center, are significant employers.
The Rochester Technology Campus is a sprawling 2.56 million sq. ft. leasable facility with uses ranging from office space, manufacturing, warehousing, data centers, and laboratories. It has been home to several technology companies. This is where IBM designed and produced its midrange computer series. It was also the home of the first Blue Gene prototype and contributed the servers for Roadrunner.

The economy of Rochester is also influenced by the agricultural nature of the region. There are multiple dairy producers that are active in the area. In addition, Kerry Flavours and Ingredients, a subsidiary of the global Irish company called Kerry Group, maintains a production plant in Rochester that specializes in fermented ingredients, found in breads, meats and other processed foods.

===Destination Medical Center===
In 2013, Governor Mark Dayton signed a bill known as Destination Medical Center (DMC). It intends to increase Minnesota&#x27;s tax base, and promote business and economic growth throughout the state. Because of this legislation, The Mayo Clinic will invest in $3.5 billion to upgrade patient rooms, add additional workspace, and build research and administrative buildings.

The main developments of this plan will be in the DMC sub-districts. The &quot;Downtown Waterfront&quot; district will cover The Government Center, The Civic Center, and most areas near the Zumbro River. The &quot;Central Station&quot; district includes Central Park and most of Civic Center Drive, aimed to become a transportation hub of the city. &quot;St. Marys Place&quot; will cover St. Marys hospital and St. Marys Park, as well as most of 2nd Street. The &quot;Heart of the City&quot; will feature the Mayo Clinic campus and major residential, commercial, and retail companies. The &quot;Discovery Square&quot; area will include scientific and technology research facilities. Lastly, The &quot;UMR and Recreation&quot; district will feature Soldiers Field and the University of Minnesota Rochester campus.

==Arts and culture==
A number of Rochester buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places, including the historic Chateau Theatre, which the city purchased in 2015 for preservation, and Avalon Music, formerly a hotel important in the local civil rights movement. In 2019, after renovations and a public RFP, the Chateau Theatre has re-opened as an exhibition venue.

Founded in 1946, the Rochester Art Center is located downtown, just south of the Mayo Civic Center. In 2017, the Rochester Art Center&#x27;s financial troubles brought a renewed focus on the need for both formal and informal arts spaces in the city.

In the summer from June to the end of August, every Thursday the city puts on Thursdays Downtown where local restaurants and artists can set up booths all along First Avenue downtown Rochester. There are two stages where bands perform and provide entertainment. There are also a number of street musicians sitting on walls or standing on the sidewalks.

The oldest cultural arts institution in the community, Rochester Symphony Orchestra &amp; Chorale was founded in 1919 as a professional performing arts organization called the Rochester Orchestra. Its earliest ensemble, the Lawler-Dodge Orchestra, was founded in 1912 as a volunteer orchestra, driven by Daisy Plummer, wife of Mayo Clinic physician, Dr. Henry Plummer, and directed by Harold Cooke. In the early years, the Orchestra appeared in the former Chateau Theatre where they performed background music for silent movies.

The Gray Duck Theater, an independent movie theater, opened in 2019.

Rochester also houses the Rochester Public Library near the Civic Center. It is one of the largest libraries in the area and has been awarded the National Medal for Museum and Library Service in 2018.

The city of Rochester has also started the bike share program for its community members where the registered members and visitors can rent a bike for free through one of its bike share locations at Rochester Public Library, Peace Plaza or Rochester City Hall.

===Quarry Hill===
The foundation of Rochester State Hospital began in 1875 as the Minnesota Inebriate Asylum funded by a tax on liquor dealers. Land was purchased in 1876 and construction began in 1877, including the building of a hospital and the park nearby which was used by the patients and their families. In 1965, the park was transferred from the hospital to the state for the use of general public and since then there have been various developments in the park including the laying of paved trails. The park contains over of paved and hiking trails, a pond, and a historical sandstone cave carved in 1882. This soft St. Peter sand stone cave was dug in the late 1800&#x27;s to store food for the patients of the state hospital. The cave was later abandoned with the invention of modern refrigerators, and is now a historic site.

Quarry Hill Nature Center is the center stone of the Quarry Hill Park in Rochester. The Nature Center opened in 1973, and was expanded in 1990. In 2017, the facility added additional nordic skiing.

All municipal elected offices in Rochester are non-partisan, as stated in the city&#x27;s charter.

Rochester is the seat of Olmsted County, run by a seven-member elected county board, each representing district residents. The County Board of Commissioners oversee county operations and address citizen concerns. When a commissioner is elected, they are elected to serve a 4-year term. When that term ends, the commissioner can run for re-election if they so desire. The County Attorney and the County Sheriff are also elected to 4-year terms and can run for re-election when the term expires if they choose. Each of these elected officials acts as the director for his/her office, and are accountable to the residents of Olmsted County.

Rochester falls under the Olmsted County District Court within the Third Judicial District of the State of Minnesota.

The city includes parts of Minnesota state legislative districts 25 and 26. In the Minnesota House of Representatives, District 25A is represented by Duane Quam (R), District 25B is represented by Andy Smith (DFL), District 26A is represented by Tina Liebling (DFL), and District 26B is represented by Nels Pierson (R). In the Minnesota Senate, Rochester is represented by Liz Boldon (DFL) and Carla Nelson, (R). Rochester is located in Minnesota&#x27;s 1st congressional district, represented by Brad Finstad, a member of the Republican Party.

Rochester continues to trend Democratic in local and federal elections which has resulted in Olmsted County also seeing a shifting electorate. In the 2020 presidential election President Joe Biden obtained nearly 60% of the vote in the city, the highest vote total for a Democratic candidate in history.

==Transportation==

Rochester is served by three U.S. highways (U.S. 14, U.S. 52, and U.S. 63), and the southern edge of Rochester is skirted by Interstate 90 and State Highway 30. Olmsted County Highway 22 is also a main highway in the city. A combination of skyways and subterranean walkways link most downtown buildings, which residents often use to avoid harsh winter weather conditions. Public bus transit is run by Rochester Public Transit. Its operations are carried out by First Transit. The City of Rochester encourages biking through its numerous trails and to facilitate the biking program all the city buses have bike carriers for easy transportation of bikes.

It has direct flights to Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, and Minneapolis, with occasional charter flights servicing Riverside Resort in Laughlin, Nevada. Nonstop flights to Phoenix and Fort Myers were scheduled to begin in early 2022.

Rochester has a shuttle service connecting to the Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport by Rochester Shuttle Service and Groome Transportation (formerly Go Rochester Direct).

Rochester&#x27;s last passenger rail service, to Chicago to the southeast and Rapid City, South Dakota to the west, ended when the Chicago and North Western Railway&#x27;s &quot;Rochester 400&quot; streamliner ended service in 1963. The closest Amtrak station is at Winona, Minnesota, to the east. Travelers are able to purchase tickets from Amtrak for a shuttle bus that connects with the daily &quot;Empire Builder&quot; at La Crosse, Wisconsin.

==History==
Butler Township was organized in 1883, and named for Stephen Butler, a county official.

Between 1900 and 1910, the township&#x27;s population exploded more than five-fold with a large influx of immigrants and other arrivals, with an increase in population from 260 in 1900 to 1,439 in 1910.

A piece of the township&#x27;s history is explained in &quot;They Chose Minnesota: A Survey of the State&#x27;s Ethnic Groups&quot;, as in 1909 the Minnesota Catholic Colonization Society of St. Paul selected the rapidly growing Butler township as an ideal location for a Dutch Catholic settlement. The plan was spearheaded by a Catholic land spectator named D.S.B. Johnston, who at the time held ownership of roughly 28 of the township&#x27;s 35 square miles of land. He recruited three Dutch priests from Minnesota to return to their native land to visit several Catholic parishes and preach the benefits of emigration while offering parcels of land for sale as future farmsteads for the newcomers. In return, Johnston also promised the priests he&#x27;d recruited 40 acres of land in Butler on which a Catholic church was to be built. The venture proved to be a success, and on March 12, 1910, a party of 76 Dutch immigrants led by the three clergymen, consisting of 9 single agricultural and general laborers and 9 family groups consisting of 17 men, 14 women and 36 children under the age of 12 sailed from Antwerp to New York aboard the Red Star Line steamship &quot;Lapland&quot;. A 10th family consisting of a Dutch farmer, his wife and nine children were delayed in their departure from Antwerp and were forced to follow the rest of the party aboard the White Star Line steamer &quot;Megantic&quot;, which departed Liverpool for Boston on March 15.

According to Louis deGryse, the summer of 1910 proved very difficult for the new arrivals, as the intense summer heat and plagues of flies and mosquitoes gave many the desire to leave the area. While some did relocate, most families stayed and developed a prosperous dairying community. In October 1910, the Holy Cross Catholic Church was dedicated, becoming the nucleus of the community.
