Other settlers included immigrants from England, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Scotland, and Germany. The early townspeople and businessmen were always anxious to make Argyle an attractive community to the region.

In 1987, the legislature voted to compensate farmers for crop damage and limit the elk herd to between 20 and 30 animals, through public hunting seasons if necessary. The last hunt was in 1998.

were with the bus the day the I-35W Bridge collapsed at 6:05pm on Wednesday, August 1, 2007.

<text>Warren is a city in and the county seat of Marshall County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,605 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Warren was platted in 1879, and named for Charles H. Warren, a railroad official. A post office has been in operation at Warren since 1880.

Although several times larger than the next largest city in the county, Warren&#x27;s prominence as the county seat has been threatened several times in its history. The original plan for the Soo Line Railroad (completed in 1905) branch line that passes through Warren called for it to run from Thief River Falls to Argyle and then west. Argyle interests hoped the establishment of a railroad junction there would lead to the removal of the county seat from Warren to Argyle. Other interests prevailed, although the railroad line forms a parabola extending north from Thief River Falls, and then south to Warren, as if the plan changed while the line was being built. In 1974, citizens of the eastern part of the county, noting Warren&#x27;s location in the western quarter of the long county, and very nearly at its southern boundary, petitioned twice for the relocation of the county seat to Newfolden. Neither effort that year resulted in the question being put on the ballot, and in fact, voters in the interim had approved the construction of an addition to the courthouse in Warren.

Warren was featured on a 2006 episode of the History Channel&#x27;s &quot;UFO Files&quot; episode &quot;Alien Encounters.&quot; The unsolved case of a mysterious object impacting a county sheriff&#x27;s car on August 27, 1979, was featured (see Val Johnson Incident). This same case was also featured in 2012 on the Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot; episode &quot;MGM Fire; UFO Car, Prophecy Sword&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The Snake River flows in serpentine fashion through the city (hence its name), and both banks are developed, which has proved problematic as the city attempts flood control. Some major floods in the city&#x27;s history took place in 1896 (twice), 1969, 1974, 1979, 1996 (twice), and 1997.

The streets of the original townsite of Warren are laid out on a grid parallel and perpendicular to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad. Some newer additions, particularly those south of Bridge Street (Minnesota Highway 1) are laid out on a conventional north–south grid. The BNSF is the dividing line for the street system east and west, and Bridge Street is the dividing line north and south.

U.S. Highway 75 and Minnesota State Highway 1 are two of the main routes in the city.

At the local community center, a sect of scientologists have been discussing plans to add a worship space. In the rural area surrounding the city, there are three small Lutheran churches.

==Economy==
Agriculture and agribusiness have been the mainstays of Warren throughout its history. In fact, for most of its history, there has been no other industry at all. Although the Red River Valley has a short growing season, which is often made even shorter due to floods, the area has excellent crop yields which help make farming in the area less risky than in other areas with poorer soil. The principal crops are wheat, soybeans, potatoes, and sugar beets. Warren was at one time home to the largest independent elevator in Minnesota. Northwest Grain Cenex Harvest States Cooperative has a large elevator on the Soo Line, and the American Crystal Sugar Co. operates a sugar beet terminal just north of Warren during harvest. Warren has three bank branches, the largest being a branch of Community Bank of the Red River Valley, headquartered in East Grand Forks.

==Education and culture==
Warren is home of the Warren-Alvarado-Oslo school district. The district has one six-year high school and one elementary school, both located in Warren. Both buildings have been called superior facilities for a district its size. The high school, built in 1954, includes a 1000-seat auditorium. The elementary school, built in 1970, was originally an &quot;open school&quot; design where the classrooms were separated by chalkboard partitions rather than walls, although a few walls were installed in 1987. In the late 2000s, the school board went on to add on a new gymnasium.

Warren has a public library, the Godel Memorial Library, and is home to the Marshall County Historical Society, the Marshall County Fair, and the Warren Riverside Country Club (9-hole, par 4, grass greens).

==Transportation==
The Warren City Council voted to build an airport in 1965 for an estimated cost of $109,000. A dedication ceremony took place in August 1966.

<doc id="120744" wikidata="Q2227982" url="?curid=120744" title="Sherburn, Minnesota">
<text>Sherburn is a city in Martin County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,058 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The city of Sherburn is typical of many small communities throughout the Midwest and America, yet its history is unique in its own right. Sherburn celebrated its centennial in 1979, and since its early development in the mid to late 1800s; it has evolved due to many factors that have influenced communities of all sizes.

=== Early years ===
In the mid-1860s, George Archer had a sod tavern on the north banks of what was then Lake Manyaska located just south of Sherburn. Marked by a lone cedar tree, pioneer travelers used it as a rest stop as they traveled from Fairmont to Jackson. Soon there were pioneer settlers and a post office. As stagecoaches from Fairmont to Jackson and St. James to Estherville crossed the area, it was concluded that there was a definite need for a settlement.

The mid to late 1870s witnessed the arrival of many settlers to Martin County, primarily resulting from the growth of the railroad involving Winnebago and Fairmont. A company called Cargill, Bassett, and Hunting from La Crosse, Wisconsin, anticipated the railroad expanding west of Fairmont and, consequently, bought land in the area. As steam locomotives took water often, stops were located every or so, which may have contributed to the location of the Sherburn railroad station.

A post office has been in operation at Sherburn since 1879.

=== Name ===

Several names were originally considered for the town site, including Lone Cedar, Huntington, and Vestal. But when the Southern Minnesota Railroad came through in October 1878, the name Sherburne was accepted in honor of Sherburne S. Merrill, general manager of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad. With the railroad&#x27;s influence on the area, Sherburn&#x27;s growth by 1879 had grown to fifteen buildings with a total value of approximately $8,000.00.

=== Biker Bank Gang === 
Sherburn was not without its share of excitement in its formative years. It was the site of one of the first, and deadliest, bank robberies in Martin County&#x27;s history. The Bank of Sherburn was robbed in October 1896 by two brothers. They entered the bank and without warning shot and killed two people in the bank, one being an employee. The robbers made off on bicycles with cash estimated to be between $1,000.00 and $2,000.00. Apparently not particularly observant, they failed to notice $2,000.00 in gold and silver that remained in the till. Following their escape on bicycles, they were quickly pursued by Martin County Sheriff Hill, his deputies, and a posse of local citizens. One of the robbers was soon located at a farmhouse east of Elmore. Although surprised by the posse, he managed to fatally shoot Bancroft, Iowa, Sheriff William Gallion. The robber, in spite of being wounded, once more attempted an escape on his bicycle. When his escape appeared fruitless, and surrendering was apparently not in the cards, he put his weapon to his head and killed himself. The second robber was soon captured without incident in Lake Mills, Iowa. He confessed to the crime of robbery, but placed the blame for the murders of the two people in the Bank of Sherburn on his brother.

=== Fox Lake company ===

In 1920 several Sherburn businessmen organized the Fox Lake Park Company, issuing and selling stock to those interested in the development of the area north of Sherburn. Much of the land along the lake was platted into lots, a dance pavilion was built, and playground equipment and picnic tables were purchased. In addition, a bath house, a diving tower, a toboggan slide, and fishing piers were also constructed. Later, a tennis court and a baseball diamond, including grandstands, were added.

In 1932, the Fox Lake Golf Club was organized by ten businessmen. It started as a three-hole course, expanded to six holes, and finally became a nine-hole course. The Fox Lake Park Company was liquidated in 1944, and the dance pavilion and park area not owned by individuals were sold. The Fox Lake Golf Club purchased the land where the golf course was located.

=== &quot;Dream Team&quot; === 

Sherburn&#x27;s history includes a dream that many communities share but few accomplish. That dream, winning a state high school athletic championship, was accomplished by the 1970 Sherburn Raiders high school basketball team during a time when only one state basketball champion was crowned. That team, coached by Dennis Christopherson, breezed through the regular season undefeated. Selected as the number one seed in District V, they defeated Fairmont, Delavan, and finally Wells for the championship. They then defeated Luverne and Jackson in Region II to reach the state tournament. In the state tournament, they first defeated Melrose 65–54, and then Marshall 71–60 to advance to the championship game. They would face heavily favored South St. Paul, a team that had been rated number one throughout most of the season. The Raiders, although much maligned by the Twin Cities media as being &quot;hicks&quot;, went on to defeat the South St. Paul Packers by a score of 78–62. Governor Harold Levander, a South St. Paul resident, presenting the state championship trophy to the entire Sherburn High School team.

<text>Hutchinson is the largest city in McLeod County, Minnesota, United States. It lies along the South Fork of the Crow River. The population was 14,599 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The Hutchinson Family Singers (John, Asa, and Judson Hutchinson) are credited with founding the town in November 1855. A post office has been in operation in Hutchinson since 1856. The city was incorporated in 1904.

The Dakota under Little Crow attacked the town on September 4, 1862, during the Dakota War of that year. Several outlying buildings were burned before the townspeople were able to repel the assault from behind the town&#x27;s stockade.

In 1942, muralist Elsa Jemne completed an egg tempera on plaster mural, &quot;The Hutchinson Singers&quot;, in the town&#x27;s post office. Federally commissioned murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The program created public art for numerous buildings constructed during the Great Depression as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Public Works Administration&#x27;s program to provide employment and improve infrastructure.

Hutchinson was once served by three railroads. The Electric Short Line (commonly known as the Luce Line) provided freight and interurban service between Minneapolis and Gluek via Hutchinson. During the mid-20th century, there was extensive restructuring in the railroad industry, as automobiles caused a decline in passenger traffic and trucking cut into freight movement.

The Electric Short Line was purchased by the Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis in 1956, which was in turn purchased by the Chicago &amp; North Western in 1960. The tracks west of Hutchinson were abandoned in 1967, and the tracks between Hutchinson and Plymouth were abandoned in 1972. The Milwaukee Road had a branch line to Hutchinson from Glencoe, which was abandoned in 1956. The Great Northern Railway also had a branch line, which went from Wayzata to Hutchinson. This was taken over by Burlington Northern in 1970. In 1985 Burlington Northern petitioned to abandon its line to Hutchinson, but Dakota Rail took over operations that same year. Dakota Rail struggled to turn a profit and sought to abandon the line in 2000. The tracks were officially abandoned in 2001. Hutchinson&#x27;s Great Northern Depot has been preserved.

==Geography==

Hutchinson is in northwestern McLeod County. State highways 7, 15, and 22 are three of the city&#x27;s main routes. MN 7 leads east to Minneapolis and west to Montevideo, MN 15 leads north to St. Cloud and south to New Ulm, and MN 22 leads southeast to Glencoe, the McLeod county seat, and northwest to Litchfield.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hutchinson has an area of , of which are land and , or 3.80%, are water. The South Fork of the Crow River flows around the north and east sides of downtown. Otter Lake is formed by a dam on the river at Main Street and extends west to the city limits, then south. Campbell Lake is an arm of Otter Lake that extends to the north along the city limits. 

Started by the Hutchinson brothers, Hutchinson has the nation&#x27;s second-oldest city park system (only New York City&#x27;s Central Park is older).

<text>National referendums are seldom used in Canada. The first two referendums in 1898 and 1942 saw a large number of voters in Quebec and in the remainder of Canada take dramatically-opposing stands, and the third in 1992 saw most of the voters take a stand opposed to that of the party in power.

The government did not adopt Prohibition, saying the overall majority in favour of Prohibition was slight and turn-out low.

===Plebiscite on conscription===
The Question:
:&quot;Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligations arising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military service?&quot;

===Proposed referendums===
During the 2004 federal election, the NDP stated that it would require the federal government to hold a national referendum on electoral reform (specifically proportional representation) for support from the NDP should the Liberals win a minority government. The Liberals won a minority, and the NDP announced they would press for electoral reform through a referendum. The possibility of a national referendum on electoral reform was made more likely through the Throne speech that opened Parliament in October 2004, in which former Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin included electoral reform in his plan for the next Parliament. However, no action was taken.

Conservative Leader Stephen Harper became Prime Minister as a result of the 2006 federal election, ending the Liberals&#x27; opportunity to move on their promise.

Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau campaigned on a platform of electoral reform in the 2015 federal election, promising to eliminate the current &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; single-member plurality voting system. While Trudeau had said that he liked a system where the distribution of seats was more in line with the popular vote on a Canada-wide basis, he had acquired a preference for Instant-runoff voting, which he called preferential voting as it uses ranked ballots. His government announced in December 2015 that an all-party parliamentary committee would be formed in early 2016 to consider a variety of alternative election systems, including proportional representation. During a discussion of the plan, Democratic Institutions Minister Maryam Monsef referred to it as “an open and robust process of consultation”. However, she refused to commit to the Conservative Party&#x27;s demand for a public referendum that would allow Canadians to vote on their preferred electoral system, indicating that she did not want to &quot;prejudice the outcome of that consultation process&quot;. In the end the parliamentary committee did not settle on one alternative system, and PM Trudeau did not move to reform the election system.

There had been discussion regarding a national referendum over the issue of same-sex marriage, which was a divisive issue in Canada. A national plebiscite had been suggested by Alberta Premier Ralph Klein and some Conservatives and Liberal backbenchers. However, Paul Martin&#x27;s Liberal government, with the support of the NDP and Bloc Québécois, passed the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, legalizing same-sex marriage through Parliament in July 2005 without holding a plebiscite. In December 2006, Stephen Harper&#x27;s government introduced a motion to re-open the marriage debate, which lost. Notably, members of all parties, including some Conservative cabinet members, voted it down.

==Provincial and Territorial referendums==
For a list of Wikipedia articles on provincial referendums, see :Category:Referendums in Canada by province or territory. 

===Alberta===
Alberta has held several referendums during its history.

Three concerned Prohibition (ban on the sale of liquor). The referendums resulted in the adoption, retention and replacement of Prohibition -- 1915, 1920 and 1923, respectively.

Another held in 1948 was on whether or not the provincial government should take control of the province&#x27;s electrical generation and distribution system, at the time a mixed system of municipal and private corporate ownership, and the preferred method of rural electrification - private corporations or provincial government.

In 2021, a two-part referendum was held, on whether equalization payments should be eliminated from the Constitution of Canada and whether Alberta should observe daylight saving time year-round.

===British Columbia===

In British Columbia has held several referendums. A few of them are listed here.

In BC, a Treaty Referendum was held on First Nations treaty rights in 2002. The referendum proposed eight questions that voters were asked to either support or oppose. Critics claimed the phrasing was flawed or biased toward a predetermined response. Critics, especially First Nations and religious groups, called for a boycott of the referendum, and only about one third of ballots were returned, significantly less than the usual turnout in provincial general elections. The ballots that were returned showed enthusiastic support, with over 80 per cent of participating voters agreeing to all eight proposed principles.

A referendum on electoral reform on May 17, 2005, was held in conjunction with the provincial election that year. British Columbian voters were asked to approve a new electoral system based on the Single Transferable Vote called BC STV. It passed with the support of a majority of voters (57%), but failed to meet the required &quot;supermajority&quot; threshold of 60%. Premier Gordon Campbell announced due to the large support shown for electoral reform a second referendum would be held in correspondence with the 2009 British Columbia general election. This referendum would also have required approval by 60% of those voting.

The second referendum was held on May 12, 2009, in conjunction with the provincial election. The results were a &quot;supermajority&quot; of 60.92% voting for retaining the current &quot;first past the post&quot; electoral system and 39.8% voting for the proposed Single Transferable Vote.

A mail-in referendum was held from June 13 to August 5, 2011, on the fate of the province&#x27;s harmonized sales tax. The government pledged to discontinue the tax if more than 50% of the voters opt to have the tax discontinued. It was passed, with 55% in favour.

The province held another referendum on proportional representation in late 2018. With 42% turnout, proportional representation was defeated by 61% of the vote.

===Manitoba===
Manitoba held a referendum on Prohibition in 1902. A majority voted against prohibition.

===Newfoundland and Labrador===

The island of Newfoundland, then a British colony, held two referendums in 1948 to determine its future. An initial referendum was held on June 3, 1948, to decide between continuing with the British appointed Commission of Government that had ruled the island since the 1930s, revert to dominion status with responsible government, or join Canadian Confederation. The result was inconclusive, with 44.6% supporting the restoration of dominion status, 41.1% for confederation with Canada, and 14.3% for continuing the Commission of Government. A second referendum on July 22, 1948, which asked Newfoundlanders to choose between confederation and dominion status, was decided by a vote of 52% to 48% for confederation with Canada. Newfoundland joined Canada on March 31, 1949.

A referendum was held in Newfoundland and Labrador in 1995 that approved replacing the province&#x27;s system of parochial schools with a largely public school system. In 1997, a second referendum to amend the Terms of Union to allow for the Catholic and Pentecostal school systems to be disbanded and brought into the public system.

===New Brunswick===
On May 14, 2001, New Brunswick held a referendum on whether to continue to permit Video Lottery Terminals to operate in the province. 53.1% of those who voted in favour of retaining the terminals.
===NWT===
Two referendums were held in Northwest Territories.

* 1982 division of territory into two regions
* 1992 boundary between the two regions, creating Territory of Nunavut in 1999.

===Nova Scotia===
In 2004, Nova Scotia held a plebiscite on whether to allow &#x27;Sunday shopping&#x27;. The result was a slight victory for the No side although the government went ahead and legalized Sunday Shopping the following year after a court decision overturned the law.

===Ontario===
On October 10, 2007, Ontario held a referendum on whether to adopt a mixed-member proportional system of elections. The proposed system failed with 63% voting for the status quo, First-Past-the-Post voting. See 2007 Ontario electoral reform referendum for more information. This was the first referendum in that province since 1924 when a referendum on prohibition was held.

===Prince Edward Island===
The small province of Prince Edward Island (under 150,000 people and therefore in scale more like a municipal government) has had several referendums in its past, although the correct terminology in the province is a plebiscite. 

On January 18, 1988, a provincial plebiscite was held to determine if Islanders were in favour of a fixed link to the mainland. It passed 60% to 40%. This allowed the provincial and federal governments to attract contractors to build what is now the Confederation Bridge. 

On November 28, 2005, Islanders were asked to vote by plebiscite whether or not they wanted mixed-member proportional representation - partly &quot;party list-based&quot; - electoral system. Islanders decided, 64% to 36%, to keep the status quo first-past-the-post based electoral. 

A plebiscite was held in 2016 concerning mixed-member proportional representation, with the result of 52% of Islanders voting to adopt the changes. Citing low voter turn out (below 40%) in the plebiscite, the government refused to implement the reforms.
Another PEI plebiscite on electoral reform is scheduled for 2019.

===Quebec===
Three referendums were held in Quebec:

* 1919 - April 10: Referendum on the legalization of the sale of alcohol. The Yes side won.
* 1980 - May 20: Referendum on the Sovereignty-Association proposal. The No side won.
* 1995 - October 30: Referendum on Sovereignty with optional partnership offer. The No side narrowly won.

Officially though, there have been four, as the 1992 pan-Canadian referendum was organized by the DGEQ in Quebec, whereas Elections Canada organized it in the rest of Canada.
====Proposed referendums====
In 2021, the Quebec government cancelled a electoral reform referendum. 

In 2022, the Quebec Premier François Legault raised the idea of having referendum on getting more immigration powers from federal government. In 2024, Quebec Premier François Legault repeated his calls on Quebec might hold a referendum on immigration powers if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not give the province more immigration powers.

=== Yukon ===
Two referendums were held in Yukon.
* 1916 August Prohibition. Wets won by three votes.
* 1920 February Prohibition. Prohibitionists narrowly had more votes than those who wanted bars continued and also narrowly more votes than those who wanted government liquor stores.

<text>Cosmos is a city in Meeker County, Minnesota, United States, along the South Fork of the Crow River. The population was 507 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Cosmos Township was first settled by Daniel Jackman, from Maine, in 1867. On his arrival, until he could build his house, he lived in a tent and cooked on an open fire. He took up a homestead in section 26. He returned to Minneapolis the following spring, but immediately returned and built his home in the summer of 1868. In 1877, he made a trip to the Black Hills and spent the season in gold mining, but returned in the fall. When the township was organized, the first election was held at his house. He was elected the first chairman of the board of supervisors and held that office for three years.

Several others followed that first year, such as Civil War veteran Isaac L. Layton or Leighton from Maine, Hansom W. Young from New Brunswick, and Daniel S. Hoyt in 1867 as a surveyor from Massachusetts. The first two were the first farmers and they planted wheat. Originally, the town was called &quot;Nelson&quot; after Ole K. Nelson, from Norway, who was credited with bringing the first team of horses and plow and breaking the first soil. On January 25, 1870, the town and township were incorporated and its current name of Cosmos was proposed by surveyor and township clerk Daniel Hoyt. &quot;Cosmos&quot; is an ancient Greek word meaning order and harmony or &quot;represents the university of created things and its synonym is harmony.&quot;

Cosmos remained small until rumors spread around 1910 that a railroad would be built. In 1922, the Luce Railroad (Minnesota Western) was constructed, and Cosmos continued to grow. On September 24, 1926, the present village plat was made and Cosmos became an incorporated village. Hoyt was elected the first township clerk. He froze to death in February 1870, trying to walk on foot to the Minnesota River. The city was incorporated as a village on September 21, 1926, and finally as a city in 1969. A post office was established as in Renville County in 1870, then to McLeod County in 1871, and finally it was transferred to Meeker County in 1872. Isaac Layton was the postmaster. The post office closed in 1906 and re-opened in 1924. The town had a railway station serving several rail lines, including the Minnesota Western. The town sits along the South Fork of the Crow River. Today the Luce Line Trail runs from Cosmos to Minneapolis.

While the town had been organized in 1870, it wasn&#x27;t officially incorporated as a village until 1926.

<text>Litchfield is a city in and the county seat of Meeker County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 6,624 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Immigration to the county was slow until the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railroad, later called the St. Paul and Pacific and then the Great Northern, started coming through the area in 1869. The first train to arrive was a construction train on August 13, 1869.

The town site was laid out in 1869, with agriculture and agriculture-related industries making up a large base of the economy.

The town&#x27;s first post office opened in a home on September 20, 1869. It later moved to the northwest corner of Sibley Avenue and Second Street, to a clothing store owned by the town&#x27;s first official postmaster.

===Town name===
The settlers living in the area named their new community &quot;Ness&quot; on April 5, 1858, after the home of many of the first settlers: the parish of &quot;Næs&quot; in the traditional region of Hallingdal, Norway.

Litchfield got its name from a man named Electus Bachus Darwin Litchfield. He was a contractor, an investor, and a stockholder in the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, which originally went from St. Paul to St. Cloud and was built from 1862 to 1864. Later, his investments provided the means for building a more southern line through Meeker County to Breckenridge.

The village of Litchfield was originally called several different names, including &quot;Round Lake&quot;, &quot;Ripley&quot;, and finally &quot;Ness&quot;. Litchfield was originally a portion of a congressional township named Round Lake, but most people called it Ripley after Ripley Lake one mile from its center.

The people of Ness were permitted to vote on the actual chartered village name of their township. Electus Litchfield donated grants of $2,000 each to various religious sects in town to build churches, the Episcopal and Presbyterian churches being two of them. The Presbyterian Church, Litchfield&#x27;s first church, was built in 1870.

The majority of the 350 people voted for the name Litchfield over Ness, and the township of Litchfield was chartered as a village on February 29, 1872. The first village council meeting was held on April 5, 1872, in the railroad&#x27;s land office. Jesse Vawter Branham, Jr. was elected the President of the Council.

===Early history as village===

By 1871, the village had grown to double the population of Forest City, a community to the northeast. The railroad put up a one-story building called an &quot;immigrant&#x27;s reception house&quot;. In addition to Litchfield, the railroad in the 1870s put immigrant houses along its lines in villages including Willmar, Benson, Morris, and Breckenridge. The houses were &quot;fitted up with cooking stoves, washing conveniences, and beds.&quot; Newly arriving immigrants were given shelter in the reception houses and the chance to buy food and clothing at cost from the railroad while they looked for land in the area.

While most sidewalks in town were made of wood, the first cement sidewalk in Litchfield was laid in 1895 in the 200 block of Sibley Avenue.

===Early history as city===
The village of Litchfield incorporated as a city in 1943.

==Geography==
Litchfield is in the center of Meeker County. U.S. Highway 12 and Minnesota State Highways 22 and 24 are three of the main routes in the city. US 12 leads east to Cokato and west to Willmar; MN 22 leads north to Richmond and south-southeast to Hutchinson, and MN 24 leads north to Kimball. Minneapolis is to the east via US 12.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city of Litchfield has a total area of , of which are land and , or 17.92%, are water. The city limits include all of Lake Ripley, a natural lake to the southwest. Jewitts Creek drains the city to the north, leading to the North Fork of the Crow River upstream from Forest City.

* The Grand Army of the Republic Hall (G.A.R.) was founded in 1885 by Civil War veterans, who called themselves the &quot;Boys of &#x27;61&quot;. Membership was limited to Union veterans of the Civil War; their motto was &quot;Fraternity, Charity, and Loyalty&quot;. The hall remains exactly as it was when the &quot;Boys of &#x27;61&quot; met there. The Litchfield G.A.R. Hall is one of very few left in the nation and the only authentic one remaining in Minnesota. The G.A.R. Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 21, 1975.
* The Litchfield Commercial Historic District is an unusually intact business district of a small Midwestern agricultural trade center of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with 36 contributing properties mostly built between 1882 and 1940.
* The Henry Ames House was built in 1888–89 by area pioneer Henry Ames. The house is the only original structure that remains from what was known as the Litchfield Brickyard that operated during the years of 1883–1900. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 9, 1984.
* The Litchfield Opera House was built in 1900. The building is a darling of St. Paul architect William T. Towner, who designed it with a unique &quot;Renaissance Revival&quot; façade. Considered a jewel on the prairie, many people came to watch the performances of the traveling shows that came to the Opera House. The Litchfield Opera House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 1984.
* The Little Red Schoolhouse District 59 was built in 1913 on an acre of land south of Litchfield. The architecture is a classic revival-style featuring a single story, red brick exterior, hip roof, and eight white Doric columns, and was constructed at a cost of $3,500.
* Manannah (Union) Century Church, called Manannah Union Church when it was built in 1897, relied on traveling pastors to lead its flock. When membership dwindled in 1985, the church closed its doors. Esther Hegg, a longtime parishioner, bought the church at an auction. Hegg then led the charge to move the church to the Meeker County Fairgrounds in Litchfield, where it stands today.
* Ness Church was organized in 1861. It is one of the state&#x27;s oldest historical sites and the first organized church in Meeker County. Buried in its cemetery are the first five victims of the Dakota War.
* Trinity Episcopal Church, founded in 1871, was entered into the National Register of Historic Places on June 20, 1975. The architecture of the church is attributed to Richard Upjohn, an architect from New York known for Carpenter Gothic designs. Upjohn founded the American Institute of Architects and served as its first president. The door and side entry bell tower, lancet windows, and batten walls are typical characteristics of Carpenter Gothic architecture.

==History==

Union Grove Township was settled in 1856 by Lyman Allen, Andrew Hamilton, John Lowell Haywood, and a man named Baker. Allen and Haywood returned to Massachusetts in 1860. Baker died in Union Grove for unknown reasons. I don’t know if he was related to the Baker who was killed in the Acton Massacre. Lyman Allen named the town for a grove of woods that surrounded a union church where Lyman was a member. The township was organized on April 18 or 30, 1866. The meeting was held in the home of Thomas Ryckman. These residents also found the necessity to rule that hogs and sheep could not run loose between April 1 and November 1. During and following the US-Dakota War of 1862, several of the early families left the area and never returned.

There is also special education, community education, an Area Learning Center (ALC), and gifted education programming.
Milaca also hosts the world&#x27;s largest high school cross-country meet, The Milaca Mega-Meet.

===ALC===
The Milaca School District has an alternative high school that is separate from the main high school. The Milaca ALC (Area Learning Center) aims to educate students who need to repeat classes or have other life challenges and require a different education style and format. The ALC enrolls approximately 40 to 50 students ages 16–19, with four fully licensed high school teachers. Students can earn .5 credits per class in one quarter, as opposed to .5 credits per class in one semester at the high school. Classes are longer: an hour and a half for day classes and two hours for after-school classes. Several required courses can be completed as an independent study under the guidance and direction of the classroom teacher. The ALC offers no extracurricular activities, but students can participate in extra courses and activities at the main high school. While the majority of Milaca ALC students live within the Milaca School District, students from outside the district can enroll and earn credits for graduation. The ALC is many students&#x27; last chance to earn a high school diploma.

==Infrastructure==
Milaca is served by the Milaca Municipal Airport.

<text>Flensburg is a city in Morrison County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 216 at the 2020 census.

==History==
After the Little Falls and Dakota Railroad was completed in 1882, there was a sidetrack to a mill at the site which later became Flensburg Village. The mill was called &quot;Flen&#x27;s Landing&quot; or &quot;Flynn&#x27;s Siding&quot;, with a depot, and named for J. C. Flynn of Little Falls. Flynn was a teacher in the Little Falls schools in the late 1870s. Later, Flynn was an inspector for the Northern Pacific Railroad and a representative in the state legislature. He was also instrumental in developing the Little Falls &amp; Dakota (L.F.&amp; D.) railroad which ran through the future town of Flensburg.

Flensburg was platted in March 1890 by Olaf and Dagmar Searle. The post office began in 1892, and Flensburg was incorporated on June 17, 1911. Flensburg received its name in 1892, and the local newspapers, the &quot;Little Falls Weekly Tribune&quot; and &quot;Little Falls Herald&quot;, began using that name about that time. However, a brief item in the April 7, 1893, edition of the &quot;Little Falls Transcript&quot; states, &quot;The name of Flynn station, on the L.F.&amp; D., has been changed to Flensburg, to take effect on April 1, 1893&quot;. No further explanation was given.

One theory is that Flensburg may have been named after the German town of Flensburg, a seaport in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. However, many land owner surnames were Polish in the 1892 Culdrum Township Plat Book of the Flensburg area, and it seems unlikely they would have chosen the name of a distant German seaport for their new town. Since &quot;burg&quot; simply means &quot;castle&quot; it would be reasonable to name the new town Flynnsburg, or the shorter version Flensburg, since the name &quot;Flen&#x27;s Landing&quot; was also in use for Flynn Station.

<text>Little Falls is a city and the county seat of Morrison County, Minnesota, United States, near the geographic center of the state. The population was 9,140 at the 2020 census, up from 8,343 in 2010. Little Falls was the boyhood home of noted aviator Charles Lindbergh. Just across from his former home is Charles A. Lindbergh State Park, named after Lindbergh&#x27;s father, prominent Minnesota lawyer and U.S. Congressman Charles August Lindbergh.

==History==
The town developed at falls on the Mississippi River, and was named after them. Several different dams have been built over the falls during the town&#x27;s history, some of which powered sawmills in the 19th century. Today, the Little Falls Dam is a hydroelectric station that generates power for the surrounding area.

According to the obituary of the Ojibwe war chief Mou-zoo-mau-nee, the people of Little Falls asked the Ojibwe for protection in 1862 during the Sioux Uprising. The Ojibwe sent 150 warriors.

==Geography==
Little Falls is located slightly west of the geographic center of Morrison County and sits on both sides of the Mississippi River, with the downtown area on the east side. The city is north (upriver) of St. Cloud and south (downriver) of Brainerd.

U.S. Highway 10 and Minnesota State Highways 27 and 371 are three of the main routes in the city. US 10 leads south to St. Cloud and northwest to Motley; Highway 27 leads east to Pierz and west to Long Prairie; and Highway 371 leads north to the Brainerd area.

Little Falls is the eastern terminus of Minnesota Highway 28, which heads to Browns Valley at its western terminus at the Minnesota–South Dakota border. Highway 28 is co-signed with Highway 27, 12 miles west of town, until it turns towards Swanville. Highway 28 is unsigned until outside the city limits. State Highway 238 is also nearby, linking Minnesota Highway 27 at Little Falls to Interstate 94 (I-94) in Albany, south of Little Falls.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city of Little Falls has an area of , of which are land and , or 1.02%, are water (the Mississippi River). A large ravine used to run through the east side business district, past the Morrison County Courthouse and the original Little Falls City Hall. The ravine served as an outflow for excess water from Fletcher Creek, which flows into the Mississippi River approximately north of the city. Filling of the ravine began in the 1880s, to allow city development, and continued until the 1950s. It was directly filled with dirt in some locations, while in other places, buildings were built over the ravine.

Charles A. Lindbergh State Park and Historical Site is on the Mississippi River. This park was established in 1931 in memory of United States Congressman and Minnesota lawyer Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr., also known as the father of aviator Charles Lindbergh. The historical site includes the home where the aviator spent summers next to the Mississippi River and a visitor&#x27;s center that tells the Lindbergh family story and displays a full-size replica of The Spirit of St. Louis cockpit. The home, with its original family furnishings and possessions, is open for informational tours.

Two large colored murals by Frank Gosiak depicting the logging era and Main Street of Little Falls in the early 1900s were painted on the façade of the Hennepin Paper Co. warehouse on Broadway Avenue West, across from Cass Gilbert Depot. A third Gosiak mural, &quot;Door Into the Past&quot;, depicts historic Little Falls and its development to the present day. The mural is on a building at the intersection of Broadway Avenue East and Second Street.  

Two public frescoes were created at Lindbergh Elementary School by local artist Charles Kapsner. The first, &quot;The Stewardship&quot;, was completed in 1994 and portrays the values of Charles Lindbergh. It may be seen at all times of the day from 9th Street SE, as it is in a hall with glass to the exterior. The other fresco, &quot;Beginnings&quot;, is on an interior wall. It depicts the origins of Central Minnesota life and history.

The mansions of Charles A. Weyerhaeuser and Richard &quot;Drew&quot; Musser stand on 1st St SE alongside the Mississippi River and adjacent to Maple Island Park. They are furnished with antiques and original belongings of the entrepreneurial families who once occupied them. The estates are collectively known as the Linden Hill Historical Event Center. They are used for education, tours, overnight stays, conferences/retreats, weddings, family reunions and assorted special events.

Pine Grove Primeval Park and Zoo is on the west side of town, among pines in a park. It features a zoo, walking trails, picnic and playground area, a granite &quot;council circle&quot;, and a rustic log shelter. The zoo is home to a variety of exotic, native and domestic animals, including cougars, bobcats, tigers, timber wolves, bears, pronghorn, bison, elk, white tail deer, prairie dogs, yaks and a petting stable.

On the southeast side of town is St. Francis Convent and Campus. It was founded in 1891 by the Roman Catholic order of Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of Little Falls.
The Morrison County Historical Society owns and operates The Charles A. Weyerhaeuser Memorial Museum, on the west side of the Mississippi River above the confluence of Pike Creek. Weyerhaeuser was a lumberman who managed the Pine Tree Lumber Company. The Weyerhaeuser Museum property adjoins the Charles A. Lindbergh Historic Site and Lindbergh State Park. The museum was built as the new home of the Morrison County Historical Society between 1974 and 1975, with the official dedication on August 24, 1975. Before that, the Morrison County Historical Society, which was founded in 1936, made its home in the basement of the Historic Morrison County Courthouse. The Weyerhaeuser Museum contains exhibits of three-dimensional artifacts and a full archive of documents, newspapers and photos related to county history. Museum grounds are home to natural prairie gardens, a Victorian-style fountain, and a gazebo overlooking the river. The Weyerhaeuser Museum is open year-round to visitors and researchers.
The Minnesota Fishing Museum (MFM) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the heritage and history of freshwater fishing in Minnesota. It features over 8,000 artifacts in two large display rooms, the O&#x27;FISH-L Gift Shop, and tourism and DNR information. The MFM and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) partner in the MinnAqua education programs. The MFM is also host of the Let&#x27;s Go Fishing Minnesota, Little Falls Chapter.

The Paul Larson Memorial Museum, owned by John Monahan, is a collection of boats, motors and trailers. Larson founded the Little Falls-based Larson Boats, as well as the Fred Larson Wildlife Animal Collection.

The Burton-Rosenmeier House was built in 1903 for Barney Burton. Burton, born to Isaac and Sarah Burton, was the seventh of eight children. At age 18, he moved from Wisconsin to St. Cloud, Minnesota, where he engaged in the clothing and men&#x27;s furnishing business with his brother, Jacob, as a partner. In 1886, they moved their business to Little Falls, but in 1891 the brothers dissolved their partnership. Nevertheless, the business kept growing and the Barney Burton Clothing Store became the largest mercantile business in Morrison County. Burton married Sarah Deautsch, of Minneapolis, in 1894. She died after the birth of their daughter. In 1898, Barney married Josephine, a sister of Sarah, and had three children. At the turn of the century, they were becoming increasingly prosperous and began planning and building a home. In 1903, they started to build their house in the Classical Revival Style. Barney died of a heart attack in 1942 and Josephine died in 1953. 
Christian and Linda Rosenmeier moved to Little Falls in 1914 and resided in a flat over the Barney Burton Clothing Store. In 1921, they purchased the home with their three children, Gordon, Margaret and Donald, from the Burton family. Christian had a long career as an attorney, a president of the American National Bank and American Savings and Trust Company, and as a Minnesota state senator from 1922 to 1932. As a state senator, he was the author of the legislation, and helped in establishing Camp Ripley and Lindbergh State Park.
Gordon Rosenmeier, Christian&#x27;s oldest son, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps. In 1940, he was elected to the unexpired term of the late senator Fred Miller of Little Falls, and he served in the Minnesota State Senate under eight successive governors. During his three decades of service, he authored series of major bills. Gordon was also a corporate attorney for the local lumber barons R.D. Musser and C.A. Weyerheauser, whose mansions are on the adjacent property to the Rosenmeier estate. His story would not be complete without mentioning his dearest friend and companion, Margaret Hastings. After her divorce, she resettled in Brainerd, where she had accepted a teaching position. Gordon provided advice and counsel in her relocation process. Margaret served as a sounding board for Gordon&#x27;s pursuit of better government. She became an active participant in documenting his political life through a series of scrapbooks, which provided an orderly collection of media commentary. The Burton-Rosenmeier House serves as the Little Falls Convention and Visitors Bureau.

<text>Sobieski is a city in Morrison County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 210 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Sobieski was named after Polish King John III Sobieski. The House of Sobieski was a noble family with a prominent role in Polish history, and the choice of name reflects the large Polish American element in the town&#x27;s population.
Sobieski was incorporated as a village on December 2, 1915, within Sections 3-9 of Swan River Township, and separated from the township on June 10, 1920. It was developed on the site of earlier communities. The first was a post office in Section 4, 1875–1904, called &quot;Ledoux&quot; for Frank X. Ledoux, who owned a store and was first postmaster. The community was next called &quot;Swan River&quot;, not to be confused with a post office that existed from 1854 to 1879 in Benton County. In 1918 the name was changed to Sobieski. The community was also known as &quot;Green&#x27;s Ferry&quot; and &quot;Aitkinsville&quot;, the latter because William A. Aitkin, the fur trader for whom Aitkin County was named, is buried there.

From what can be gathered, as many of the local people are of Kashubian-Polish Heritage, the naming of the community for Jan Sobieski is fitting for his association with the Kashubian Polish Hussars in defeating the Ottomans, most notably at the Battle of Vienna in 1683.

==Geography==
Sobieski is in western Morrison County, southwest of Little Falls, the county seat. Sobieski is bordered to the northwest by the city of Flensburg, to the north by Pike Creek Township, to the east, south, and west by Swan River Township, and partially to the west by Swanville Township.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Sobieski has a total area of , all of it recorded as land. The Swan River passes through the city, flowing east to the Mississippi River away.
