<text>Thibodaux ( ) is a city in, and the parish seat of, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, United States, along the banks of Bayou Lafourche in the northwestern part of the parish. The population was 15,948 at the 2020 census. Thibodaux is a principal city of the Houma–Bayou Cane–Thibodaux metropolitan statistical area.

Thibodaux is nicknamed the &quot;Queen City of Lafourche&quot;, and is home to Nicholls State University.

== History ==
The first documented Native American inhabitants of the Thibodaux area were the Chawasha, a small tribe related to the Chitimacha of the upper Bayou Lafourche. The first settlers of European descent in this area arrived in the 18th century, when Louisiana was the Spanish province of Luisiana. They consisted of French nationals and Louisiana-born French and German creoles, followed shortly by Spanish and French Acadian immigrants. The colonists gradually began to import Africans in bondage as slaves to work on and develop rice and sugar cane plantations.

The United States acquired Louisiana from France in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase, after Napoleon, then First Consul, decided to sell France&#x27;s North American possessions due to the failure to regain control of Saint-Domingue (which became the Republic of Haiti) and the impending threat of war with Great Britain. The present State of Louisiana became the U.S. Territory of Orleans, and in 1805 the Territorial Legislature created ten counties, among them the County of Lafourche (later Lafourche Parish). Americans from other states then began to settle in the area.

As early as 1808, a trading post and small village, known as &quot;Thibodeauxville,&quot; had been established on the west bank of Bayou Lafourche, due to its strategic location near the confluence of Bayou Lafourche and Bayou Terrebonne. By the 1820s, the village had grown to a local center of the sugar cane industry. This settlement was formally incorporated as a town in 1830 under the name &quot;Thibodauxville&quot;, in honor of local planter Henry Schuyler Thibodaux, the son of Acadian exiles. He had provided the land for the original village center and, as lieutenant governor, assumed the office of acting governor of the State of Louisiana in 1824. The area was developed in the antebellum period for sugar cane plantations, and Thibodaux was the trading center of the region. Sugar cane was an important commodity crop. The name of the town was shortened to &quot;Thibodeaux&quot; in 1838. The current spelling of the city&#x27;s name, &quot;Thibodaux,&quot; was apparently officially adopted in 1900.

In January 1844, the prominent statesman and U.S. Senator Henry Clay, the &quot;Great Compromiser,&quot; visited Thibodaux for several days as part of his campaign for the U.S. Presidency. A residential lane along the canal connecting Bayou Lafourche to Bayou Terrebonne was later named in his honor.

Confederate General Braxton Bragg, the victor at Chickamauga, and his wife had a plantation, &quot;Bivouac,&quot; just north of Thibodaux and attended services at St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church on Jackson Street, founded by Bishop Leonidas Polk, the owner of &quot;Leighton&quot; plantation and later a Confederate lieutenant general killed in action.

In 1896, the first rural free delivery of mail in Louisiana began in Thibodaux. It was the second such RFD in the United States.

===Civil War===
On June 20, 1863, Texas Confederate cavalry forces attacked the Union force occupying Thibodaux and captured the town. In a letter dated July 1, 1863, to his sister, Confederate Texas cavalryman Benjamin Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Price proudly described the courage of his horse and a dramatic cavalry charge across the rebuilt Jackson Street bridge:

I wish you could have seen Rowdy in the charge upon [Thibodaux]ville, I never saw a better cavalry horse, about three hundred of the best horses of the regiment was selected by Lt[.] Col[.] Crump to make the charge, and I can assure you that Rowdy stood the fire of the enemies [&quot;sic&quot;] guns as well or better than the rider. The cowardly Yankees could have killed all of us while we were crossing the bridge of [Thibodaux] but they only fired three rounds before they skedaddled and then such a yell; In one hour after we entered the town, the victory was ours...

===Post-Reconstruction and Thibodaux massacre===

In the late 19th century, after having taken back control of the state government following the Reconstruction era by use of election fraud and violence by paramilitary forces such as the White League, which suppressed black voting, white Democrats continued to consolidate their power over the state government. In the late 1880s they were challenged temporarily by a biracial coalition of Populists and Republicans. In this period, because blacks were skilled sugar workers, they briefly retained more rights and political power than did African Americans in the north of the state who worked as tenant farmers or sharecroppers on cotton plantations.

But from 1880, through the Louisiana Sugar Producers Association, some 200 major planters worked to regain slave conditions and control of workers, adopting uniform pay, withholding 80 percent of the workers&#x27; pay until after harvest, and making them accept scrip, redeemable only at plantation stores owned by the planters, rather than cash. Cane workers struck intermittently against these conditions.

The Knights of Labor organized a chapter in 1886 in Shreveport, Louisiana and attracted many cane workers seeking better conditions. A sugar cane workers&#x27; strike in Lafourche and three neighboring parishes involved 10,000 workers, 1,000 of whom were white, during the critical &quot;rolling period&quot; of the sugar cane harvest. Planters were alarmed both by outside labor organizations and the thought of losing their total crops. The governor called in the state militia at the planters&#x27; request; they protected strikebreakers and evicted black workers. The strike was broken in Terrebonne Parish.

Paramilitary forces closed off Thibodaux, where numerous black workers had taken refuge. A New Orleans newspaper reported that &quot;for three weeks past the negro women of the town have been making threats to the effect that if the white men resorted to arms they would burn the town and [end] the lives of the white women and children with their cane knives.&quot; Similarly, in the days leading up to the climactic event, it was reported that &quot;[s]ome of the colored women made open threats against the people and the community, declaring that they would destroy any house in the town&quot; and that &quot;[n]ot a few of the negroes boasted that in case a fight was made they were fully prepared for it.&quot; One historian adds:

As late as November 21 some still comported themselves with confidence, and perhaps bravado, on the sidewalks. Mary Pugh, widow of Richard Pugh, owner of Live Oak Plantation in Lafourche Parish, reported &quot;meeting negro men singly or two or three together with guns on their shoulders going down town &amp; negro women on each side telling them to &#x27;fight - yes - fight we&#x27;ll be there.&#x27;&quot;
On November 23, after the ambush and wounding of two pickets posted in the southern section of town, the militia committee began to indiscriminately shoot black workers and some family members, killing an estimated 35 (and quite possibly more) in what is called the &quot;Thibodaux massacre&quot; of November 23, 1887. The incident is generally considered to be the second bloodiest labor dispute in U.S. history. Casualties including wounded and missing were claimed by some to be in the hundreds, but there has never been an accurate count.

The cane workers returned to the plantations under conditions dictated by white planters. The massacre and subsequent disenfranchisement of blacks in Louisiana at the turn of the century by making voter registration more difficult, and white Democrats&#x27; imposition of Jim Crow, ended labor organizing of cane workers until the 1940s.

==Economy==
As a village, Choudrant has limited business opportunity. There are several &quot;home grown&quot; businesses within the village limits. The most prominent of local businesses is Origin Bank, founded as the Bank of Choudrant. It has since grown to become one of the largest banks in both Lincoln Parish and the neighboring Ouachita Parish. Despite its growth though, the FDIC still recognizes the original Choudrant branch as its home office. Origin Bank also sponsored the Louisiana Peach Festival in Ruston until 2005, whence sponsorship was taken up by Squire Creek Country Club.

==Government==
Choudrant is served by four elected officials—a mayor and three village aldermen. Other public employees include a town clerk and a small police force. For many years, Choudrant was served by only one law enforcement officer, its police chief, but the force has grown in recent years adding additional officers and a canine unit. The Lincoln Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Office also provides law enforcement services as needed.

Fire protection in the Village is provided by the Choudrant Volunteer Fire Department.

==Education==

Choudrant is located within the fifth district of the Lincoln Parish School System. There are two schools within the Choudrant district—Choudrant Elementary and Choudrant High. The elementary school services between 400 and 450 students in grades K-6 while the high school contains approximately 350 students in grade levels 7-12. Both schools are well known as having high academic achievement under the state&#x27;s school improvement plan and No Child Left Behind. The high school was rebuilt in 1937 after a fire and has had no substantive renovations or updates since that time. Choudrant Elementary was similarly rebuilt and expanded after a fire in the 1970s, but the student population had outgrown its walls. However, attempts to renovate the high school and rebuild the elementary school were halted in 2007 when citizens of the school district voted by a 2-1 majority against passage of a bond issue to fund such changes. The Tax later passed a couple years later. Since then the high school has been rebuilt and added an entire new wing, a new ag center and a new track.

<text>Dubach is a town in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 908 in 2020. Dubach is part of the Ruston micropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Although there were settlers in the Dubach area as early as the late-1840s, the town&#x27;s origins date to the arrival of the Arkansas Southern Railway in 1898. With the coming of the railroad, the way was opened for the development of the lumber industry. In 1899, Fred B. Dubach, a lumberman from St. Louis, Missouri, arrived in the area and started the Dubach Lumber Company. Shortly thereafter he built a large house and a lumber mill was located across the road. An old aerial photograph indicates that the lumber mill was by far the largest building in town and visually dominated the townscape. Undoubtedly the Dubach Lumber Company was a major factor in the growth and development of what in 1901 was chartered as the town of Dubach. A few years later (c. 1906), Dubach sold his mill and home and returned to St, Louis. Dubach&#x27;s home still stands and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The sawmill no longer exists.

In the fall of 2005, Dubach voters defeated a bond issue that would have funded renovations to Hico Elementary and Dubach High schools. Despite a well-spoken campaign by high school principal Donna Doss, voters killed the issue by a wide margin. Local media speculated that the economic effects of Hurricane Katrina may have swayed voters to err on the side of caution with regards to new taxation. The high school closed and students now attend Ruston High School. Only Dubach Elementary School remains.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (2.72%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 908 people, 387 households, and 241 families residing in the town.

==Arts and culture==
The Autrey house (and museum) just west of town is the oldest home in the area and is an excellent example of the early and rare form of frontier architecture.

===Festivals===
Dubach is also home to the Louisiana Chicken Festival, held in late September.

==Notable people==
* Bill Doss, an American rock musician and native of Dubach.
*Dixie Garr, Technology Executive
* Willis Reed, former New York Knicks center and member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame

<text>Ruston is a small city in and the parish seat of Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, United States. The 2020 population was 22,166. Ruston is near the eastern border of the Ark-La-Tex region and is the home of Louisiana Tech University. Ruston is the principal city of the Ruston micropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Lincoln Parish.

== History ==

During the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War, word soon reached the young parish near what is now Ruston, that the Vicksburg, Shreveport, and Pacific Railroad would begin to run across north Louisiana, linking the Deep South with the West (the current operator is Canadian Pacific Kansas City). Robert Edwin Russ, the Lincoln Parish sheriff from 1877–1880, donated to the town and the area was eventually known as Ruston in his honor.

In 1883, commercial and residential lots were created and sold for $375 apiece; and soon the sawing of lumber and clacking of hammers could be heard throughout the area.

Vienna was the parish seat of Lincoln Parish from its creation in 1873 until 1884, when a parish-wide vote moved it to the new town of Ruston.

As the town began to take shape, new churches, businesses, civic organizations and schools were being established. Cotton farming fueled the economy. In 1900 a second railroad, running north and south, was built through Ruston (the operator before the tracks were removed was Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad). This brought even more business and industry to the area and the population continued to provide a foundation for the local economy. By the time the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, Ruston was established as a center for learning, a place of civic pride, and as an area of economic prosperity throughout the region.

In 1938 Ruston received national attention when an African-American teenager named R.C. Williams was lynched in one of the most brutal attacks of its type in many years. The 19 year old Williams was accused by a mob of vigilantes of killing a white man and assaulting a white woman, although it was later determined to be highly unlikely that Williams was guilty of these, or any other crimes. The vigilantes captured Williams and after torturing him with red-hot pokers (castration was also suspected) and shooting him numerous times, he was hung from a tree. Although a local sheriff tried to stop the mob, they then threatened the sheriff&#x27;s life, and the lynching continued. A grand jury of all white men later cleared all of the perpetrators of any wrongdoing. The crime had a significant and long lasting impact on state and national politics, and can be directly related to the rise of segregationist demagoguery in the south.

Ruston grew steadily during the post-World War II years. The GI Bill of Rights sent war veterans to college, helped to fuel the local economy, brought growth to the two local universities, Louisiana Tech University and nearby historically black Grambling State University, and new families moved into Lincoln Parish. By the middle 1960s, Interstate 20 passed through the northern part of Ruston. This major interstate highway made Ruston more easily accessible, much as the railroad had done a century earlier. In the 1980s, the state of Louisiana economy declined as the oil industry went into a recession.

Ruston, however, continued growing steadily because of the rapid expansion of Louisiana Tech. The city also had its centennial celebration during this decade, and emphasis was placed on revitalizing the historic downtown district. A joint effort between the city and the Louisiana Main Street Program and the Louisiana Department of Historic Preservation brought forth beautification projects to rehabilitate the downtown district, and helped draw the community closer to its roots. More than fifteen buildings have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The city has a new general aviation airport to serve existing business and industry, and the timber, poultry and cattle industries continue to expand.

The Arkansas Southern Railroad Company (ASRR), that became the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway (CRI&amp;P), built a station named Chautauqua, north of Ruston that became part of the town.

In 1947, area peach growers organized the Louisiana Fruit Growers Association and held the first festival four years later on June 27–28, 1951. On that occasion, Justin Wilson, the popular south Louisiana chef and Cajun humorist entertained the audience at Howard Auditorium on the Louisiana Tech campus. Then State Senator Dudley J. LeBlanc of Abbeville in Vermilion Parish, the promoter of the patent medicine known as Hadacol, was invited to crown the first Peach Festival Queen, Ann Colvin of Bernice in Union Parish.

<doc id="115653" wikidata="Q2216044" url="?curid=115653" title="Albany, Louisiana">
<text>Albany is a town in eastern Livingston Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,088 at the 2010 census and 1,235 in 2020. It is part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area.

District 95 State Representative Sherman Q. Mack, an attorney, resides in Albany.

==Etymology==
It is speculated that the name of the community is derived from the Choctaw word &quot;abani&quot; which means &quot;to cook over a fire&quot; in the Choctaw language. After interviewing many of the older residents and comparing their answers it was determined that the community was named after the nearby Natalbany River. During an interview Mrs. George (Mary Addison) Cunningham who was born on November 11, 1884, stated that when the Illinois Central Railroad built a line through the town they tried to name the community Natalbany but the railroad and post office refused the name because there was already a community with the same name.

==Hungarian Settlement==
Historic Hungarian Settlement is in Albany. Between 1896 and 1920 hundreds of Hungarian immigrants settled here and named the community Árpádhon. In 1900, there were eleven families living in the Hungarian Settlement and by 1908 there were about forty Hungarian families on new farms in the area. By 1910, there were sixty-five families. In 1920, there were about two hundred families on farms in the area. The Hungarian name is derived from Árpád, the leader of the Hungarian tribes and &quot;-hon&quot; meaning home. Árpádhon was the largest rural Hungarian settlement in the United States at that time with an estimated 350 Hungarian families living within the community. During the 1930s many of the Hungarian families became strawberry farmers.

==Geography==
Albany is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 190 and Louisiana Highway 43 and I-12 passes south of the city. The Little Natalbany River flows past the east side of the city and joins the Natalbany River approximately two miles to the southeast.

<text>Denham Springs is a city in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, United States. The 2010 U.S. census placed the population at 10,215, up from 8,757 at the 2000 U. S. census. At the 2020 United States census, 9,286 people lived in the city. The city is the largest area of commercial and residential development in Livingston Parish. Denham Springs and Walker are the only parish municipalities classified as cities. The area has been known as Amite Springs, Hill&#x27;s Springs, and Denham Springs.

==History==

===19th century===
The original land claims of John Noblet and Alexander Hogue form what is now the older section of Denham Springs, including the first residential and business districts. In 1828, William Denham, a Wilkinson County, Mississippi, native, married Mercy Hogue, the daughter of Alexander Hogue. Three months later he purchased the originally claimed by his father-in-law. Denham purchased the land and a slave for $1,350.

A popular belief, supported by previously published histories, is that William Denham discovered the mineral springs on his property and that a health resort quickly grew up there. This belief defies logic, however, considering the number of springs which may be found in this area even today, and the length of time that elapsed before Denham arrived. Hogue and other early residents of the area likely depended on the springs for drinking water.

It was in the 1850s that Amite Springs became synonymous with the area that is now Denham Springs.

On May 1, 1855, Denham sold the Hogue tract to Stamaty Covas of New Orleans for $3,050, and Denham eventually moved to Baton Rouge and to Texas. Apparently during the time Covas owned the Hogue-Denham tract, and before the Civil War, a health resort did flourish at Amite Springs—as the hamlet was known at the time. Several newspaper articles and advertisements survive from that period, which describe the hotel and the facilities which it offered.

An article in the Baton Rouge Daily Comet, on June 25, 1856, notes that a bridge of boats had been formed at Benton&#x27;s Ferry over the Amite River to facilitate travel to Amite Springs. Benton&#x27;s Ferry was the name of the post office which was established near Amite Springs on January 25, 1856, and named for Robert Benton, its first postmaster and also the operator of the ferry across the Amite.

It is assumed that the hotel was burned during the Civil War, although no evidence to support this assumption has been found to this date. Following the Civil War, Covas, the New Orleans businessman, lost possession of the Hogue-Denham tract when George L. Minton bought it for delinquent taxes of $124.00.

According to the 1882 act of sale, the land was bounded &quot;east by Chambers, south by Noblet, west by the Amite River, north by Allen, and known as the Denham Springs tract.&quot; This points to the fact that although William Denham had moved away nearly 30 years before, his name was still associated with the mineral spring area.

Minton, the first mayor of Denham Springs and founder of the Denham Springs News, thus received title to much of what is now the downtown section of Denham Springs. Conveyance records at the parish courthouse show that he then began subdividing the tract and selling the lots for residences and businesses. By this time, the large Noblet holdings were also being subdivided and sold to newcomers, and the village that became Denham Springs began to grow.

In October, 1879 John Sullivan made an application for the establishment of a post office north of the present city limits. The location of the office was given as one mile (1.6 km) south of Beaver Creek and one mile (1.6 km) east of the Amite River on what is now La. Hwy. 1028 or the Old River Road.
Three names were considered for the post office - Pine Bluff, Allen and Hill&#x27;s Springs - with the Post Office Department settling on the latter when it was finally established on January 12, 1880. By at least 1890, John R. Allen had become the postmaster and the office was moved inside the present city limits. On May 9, 1898, the name of the post office was changed to Denham Springs.

Another reason given for the development of the community is that the Denham Springs Collegiate Institute was founded by a group or residents in 1895. According to a graduate of the institute, the school was a good one, attracting boarders from miles around. The boarding students may have created more demand for hotels than did people visiting the springs, although the hotels did have many guests in the summer. The Collegiate Institute was located on the site of the present Presbyterian Church, on property sold to the private school by George L. Minton. The first buildings included a large meeting hall and a smaller frame structure. The four-year institution was financed by tuition paid by students from Denham Springs and neighboring communities, and the board of directors was able to attract teachers from as far away as Virginia.

===20th century===
George L. Minton was elected the first mayor of Denham Springs upon its founding in 1903 and served until J.M. Smiley was elected in April 1912. Smiley moved from the village later that year and J.O. Brannon was elected mayor in a special election. He received 17 votes and was unopposed.

Two reasons were given for the development of Hill&#x27;s Springs and Denham Springs in the 1890s and early 20th century prior to the completion of a Baton Rouge to Hammond railroad line. One was the development of the springs by hotel owners. A New Orleans publication entitled Men and Matters described the so-called health-restoring properties of the spring water in a 1902 article on Denham Springs. Ivy Cockerham and J.B. Easterly built hotels in the area near the present public park on Tabernacle Street, and there were some who believed the springs to be beneficial to the sick.

Circa 1908, the board of directors of the Denham Springs Collegiate Institute deeded the property to the public school system, which was coming of age with the construction of consolidated schools, and shortly thereafter, a two-story brick building was erected on the same site. This was to be the beginning of Denham Springs High School, now the parish&#x27;s largest senior high school.

On May 8, 1903, Gov. William W. Heard issued a proclamation incorporating the village of Denham Springs. Governor Huey Long designated Denham Springs as a town on February 5, 1929 and Lt. Gov. Lethar Frazar, standing in for the Kingfish&#x27;s brother Earl, proclaimed Denham Springs to be a city on September 5, 1957.

Several factors influenced the growth of Denham Springs after 1900, notably the construction of the railroad line, the growth of Baton Rouge as an industrial center, and the corresponding improvement of roads which made Denham Springs a desirable place for Baton Rouge workers to live. The railroad prompted the gradual movement of businesses toward the present Range Avenue area, and later made Denham Springs the shipping hub of a large truck crop region. The Baton Rouge-Hammond line was completed by the Illinois Central railroad during the first part of February, 1908 and the first train ran on February 26. Denham Springs almost missed being included on the route, however, as the Baton Rouge, Hammond and Eastern Railroad Co., which was later purchased by the IC, at one time considered bypassing the village, perhaps to force some concessions on the local residents&#x27; part.

The construction of good roads and the advent of the automobile, combined with the growth of the petrochemical industry in Baton Rouge led to Denham Springs becoming the so-called &quot;bedroom of Baton Rouge&quot;. Denham Springs became the banking and commercial center of Livingston Parish.

The Denham Springs City Hall was listed in the National Register of Historic Places listings in Louisiana on April 16, 1993.

===21st century===
The city is situated at the intersections of the east-west highways, US 190 and Interstate 12, with La. Hwy. 16, the major north-south artery in western Livingston Parish. Denham Springs is also located on the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad, a line which played a large role in the city&#x27;s early development. The Amite River also forms a portion of the municipality&#x27;s boundary, but the river is not navigable at this point. Ground-water springs which come to the surface at the base of the low-lying ridge which runs through the center of the city have figured in the city&#x27;s name since at least the 1850s.

A state of emergency was declared in mid-August 2016 when waters began rising in rivers, lakes, and bayous all across the southern area of the state. Denham Springs took much of the damage. 90% of the homes in Greater Baton Rouge were either damaged or destroyed. The Amite River, the main body of water in Denham Springs, was one of the most publicized rivers that flooded.

Downtown Denham Springs has transformed itself from hardware stores, drug stores, doctors&#x27; offices, and a single movie theater, into a collection of unique antique shops, and boutiques, including the locally popular restaurants and Cafes. The historic downtown district is now recognized as a cultural arts district and is known as the Denham Springs Antique Village.

Denham Springs is located in the Florida Parishes of the U. S. state of Louisiana, and within the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area.

=== Climate ===

<text>Livingston is the parish seat of Livingston Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,769 at the 2010 census.
Livingston hosts one of the two LIGO gravitational wave detector sites, the other one being located in Hanford, Washington.

==History==

Like the parish, Livingston takes its name from the jurist Edward Livingston.

Livingston was the site of a major train derailment (spilling about 200,000 gallons of chemicals) in 1982.

On February 11, 2016, it was officially announced that the LIGO collaboration successfully made the first direct observation of gravitational waves in September 2015. Barry Barish, Kip Thorne and Rainer Weiss were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for leading this work.

The communities of Doyle and Livingston, combined in 1955 to create the Town of Livingston. Doyle was established northeast of present-day Livingston, located on Hog Branch, off present-day North Doyle Road but moved when the railroad was built from Baton Rouge to Hammond, and the community was re-located in 1901 by the McDonald family.

Livingston was started by the Lyons Lumber Company in 1916 as a logging community on 63 acres just west of Doyle, to support their logging industry and timber mill in Garyville, located south of Livingston on the Mississippi River. Therefore, Livingston and Garyville are sister cities.

<text>Springfield is a town in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 487 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Springfield began in the 18th century at one of the northernmost points considered to be navigable on the Natalbany River. Between Springfield and Lake Maurepas, Ponchatoula Creek joins the Natalbany and increases its flow. The town was also connected to the Natchez Trace.

Via the Natalbany, Lake Maurepas, Lake Pontchartrain, and Bayou Saint John, Springfield had access to New Orleans by water. Similarly, at the time (prior to the damming of the channel by levees) along the Amite River and Mississippi River, Bayou Manchac provided shallow-water access between Springfield and Baton Rouge. By 1810 Springfield was one of the areas of interest in the rebellion against Spain, which produced the short-lived Republic of West Florida. Bricks from an old Spanish fort can still be found, roughly 200 yards in front of today&#x27;s post office. At this time the area was part of St. Helena Parish, with Livingston Parish created in 1832 from the southern portion of St. Helena.

Springfield served as the Livingston parish seat from 1835 to 1872. The town was incorporated in 1838. A post office was listed in Springfield, Livingston County (Parish), on October 1, 1846, with Jacob P. Randolph as the postmaster.

In the early part of the 19th century, Peter av Hammerdal (Peter Hammond), eponym of Hammond, Louisiana, came to do business of transporting lumber and other products for ocean-going ships in New Orleans, via the rivers and lakes south of Springfield.

The Springfield city fathers, fearing a lawless element, declined to allow a railway track to be laid from New Orleans through Springfield and then north. (This decision gave birth to Ponchatoula, Hammond, Amite, and other towns.) The 1854 completion of the New Orleans, Jackson &amp; Great Northern Railroad (now the Canadian National Railway)—which went through Hammond, Ponchatoula, and Manchac—bypassed Springfield and deprived it of a logistical role.

When Tangipahoa Parish was formed partly from Livingston Parish in 1868, Springfield was no longer a central location in Livingston Parish. It sat along the new boundary between Livingston and Tangipahoa Parishes. Today&#x27;s seat of government for Livingston Parish is the city of Livingston.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.4 square miles (3.6 km), all land.

The town&#x27;s name is derived from the numerous artesian springs in the area.

==History==
The area now known as Walker was founded by Michael Joseph Milton, Jr. (1795-1863) and “several slaves” in 1825. Michael Milton married in 1832 in Livingston Parish. He and his wife, Martha Clark Milton (1803-1878) developed 343 acres from a Land Grant for his service in the War of 1812. The Milton family was a pioneering family from North Carolina and a first family in Virginia who settled in an area in Alabama, and in Florida before establishing the new community in the piney woods east of the Amite River and Denham Springs. In this sense, Walker, Louisiana, by virtue of its establishment, traces its roots to the founding of the nation in Jamestown, Virginia. The Federal government recognized the growth of the settlement and opened a post office as Milton Old Field in 1856. Michael Milton was appointed as postmaster in 1858.

<text>Tallulah ( ) is a city in, and the parish seat of, Madison Parish in northeastern Louisiana, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,286, down from 7,335 in 2010.

As this was historically a center of agriculture since the antebellum years, producing cotton and pecans, Tallulah and the parish have long had majority-African American populations. The small city is now nearly 77 percent African American; the surrounding parish is 60 percent black. Mechanization and industrial agriculture have reduced the number of jobs, and many residents have moved since the mid-20th century to larger cities with more opportunities.

Tallulah is the principal city of the Tallulah Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Madison Parish. The Madison Parish Sheriff&#x27;s office operates the Steve Hoyle Rehabilitation Center in Tallulah.

==History==
This area was developed in the antebellum years by European Americans for cotton plantations. They brought in thousands of enslaved African Americans to produce and process the crops. Major planters grew wealthy from their labor at a time when the market for cotton was strong.

===Post-Civil War to 1942===
After the American Civil War, many freedmen from the plantations stayed in the parish, often working as sharecroppers. In the late 19th century, Italian immigrants settled in Louisiana, most in New Orleans but some in outlying parishes such as Madison. Some served as migrant workers on cotton or sugar cane plantations, in the north or south of the state, respectively. The immigrants were primarily from Sicily. Starting as farm workers, some banded together to establish small stores, such as groceries in parish seats and other trading towns.

By 1899, five Sicilians were doing a good business in Tallulah, with four small stores devoted to fruit, vegetables and poultry. All but one of the men were relatives. Whites attacked the Sicilians because of economic competition. They had also been criticized for failing to comply with Jim Crow rules: if they had black customers waiting, they made new white customers wait their turn rather than giving the whites preference, as was the custom. On July 20, 1899, a mob of white residents of Tallulah lynched the five Sicilians from Cefalù. Two other Italians who lived in nearby Milliken&#x27;s Bend fled the area for their safety. The Italians were still citizens (nationals) of Italy, and their government protested strongly to the United States government about each lynching murder. The US government said that the states had to prosecute such killings. As was typical in this period of frequent lynchings of black US citizens, none of the white lynch mob was prosecuted.

The city developed through the early 20th century and had a growing population, as people came in from rural areas to work in the lumber mills and timber processing. Because it was the center of a major agricultural area, Tallulah became the site of the Louisiana Delta Fair, held annually in October through the first half of the 20th century. It featured exhibits from Madison, East Carroll, and Tensas parishes. Later in the century, the fair was phased out.

Shirley Field, also known as Scott Field, was reportedly the first airport in Louisiana; it was built in 1922 near Tallulah. Dr. B.R. Coad, head of the Agricultural Experiment Laboratory, developed a process and equipment for crop dusting from airplanes, in order to combat the devastating boll weevil infestation of cotton crops. The USDA bought a Huff-Daland plane for this purpose in 1924. Hundreds of flights took off from the Tallulah Airport as this process was developed, and fields on both sides of the Mississippi were treated. Delta Air Lines had its origins from Delta Dusters, the company developed here to produce and operate crop dusting from airplanes. Shirley Field and the original airport building still stand near Tallulah, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

The parish seat also attracted Jewish immigrants. Based on the success of their drugstore, in 1927 merchant brothers Mertie M. and Abe Bloom built the first enclosed shopping mall, Bloom&#x27;s Arcade, in the United States in Tallulah. It was built by A. Hays Town in the style of European city arcades. The building had a central hall, with stores located on either side, much like the ones today. The hall opened into the street on both ends. This landmark is still in Tallulah, located along what is now U.S. Route 80. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). As of late 2013, it had been restored to its original architectural character and was adapted as an apartment complex.

Later in 1927, the downtown was flooded during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. Many downtown stores were flooded by several feet of water. It took time for the town to recover.

===World War II to present===
After serving in World War II, African-American veterans began to challenge racial discrimination in the South more vigorously. After the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; (1944) that the white primary of the Democratic Party was unconstitutional, more blacks began to register in the South. However, in Louisiana, the number of white qualified voters in 1947 still surpassed blacks by a ratio of 100 to one.

The population increased in Tallulah in the decades after the war, reaching a high in 1980 (see tables below). African Americans were the majority population in the city and the parish. Having faced continuing discrimination in efforts to vote, in 1962 a group of eight African-American men successfully sued the parish registrar and state to be able to register and vote. Following passage of the national Civil Rights Act in 1964, in 1965, activists conducted boycotts to end discrimination in employment; many stores would not hire blacks as workers. Seventeen businesses closed in the city rather than hire blacks.

That year, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, authorizing the federal government to oversee voter registration and elections in jurisdictions such as Tallulah and Madison Parish with historic under-representation of minorities. The proportion of African-American voting began to increase.

In 1969, Zelma Wyche, a local veteran and activist, was elected as Police Chief of Tallulah, the first African American to hold the office. He ensured there were an equal number of white and black police officers on the force and had them patrol in mixed teams.

In 1971, black candidates were running for 21 of 27 parish seats in Madison Parish, a sign of the changing times. In other parts of Louisiana, African Americans were also running for local offices.

In 1974, Adell Williams was elected as mayor of Tallulah, the first African American to hold the office. He is believed to have been the first black mayor elected in Louisiana since Reconstruction.

The city had its peak of population in 1980. The mechanization of agriculture and the decline of some former industries have reduced the number of local jobs, with population following. It used to be considered a lumber mill town, with the Chicago Mill and Lumber dominating local industry from its site on the west side of the city. After declines from the 1970s, the mill closed in 1983, adding to local economic problems.

Unlike some other areas of the state, only four antebellum structures remain in the parish, because of destruction by General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s forces during the Vicksburg Campaign in the Civil War. One is a one-story 1855 plantation house, known as Hermione, from the Kell Plantation. It was used by Grant as a Union hospital.

After being donated to the Madison Historical Society in 1997, Hermione was moved to its current site on North Mulberry Street in Tallulah. It was adapted to serve both as offices for the society and as the Hermione Museum, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Among its exhibits is one about Madam C. J. Walker, the first African-American woman to become a self-made businesswoman and millionaire.

Born free soon after the war as Sarah Breedlove in nearby Delta, Louisiana, she moved north as a young woman, where she developed a line of hair-care products that she manufactured and sold nationally. The museum is on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail.

On April 24, 2010, an EF4 tornado touched down just outside Tallulah, causing numerous injuries. The tornado damaged a tanker in a chemical plant, causing a small nitrogen leak. Significant damage to an industrial plant with associated injuries, trapped people, and destroyed homes nearby were reported in Madison Parish near the Louisiana-Mississippi state line. The tornado continued across the Mississippi River. It gained strength and struck Yazoo, Holmes, and Choctaw counties in Mississippi, causing 10 fatalities and extensive destruction.

===Seviers of Tallulah===
Tallulah and Madison Parish have been led and represented politically by numerous members of the prominent Sevier family, who were longtime planters. They are descended from John Sevier, a veteran of the American Revolution, and his wife. Later they were pioneers in what is now Tennessee, and Sevier was elected as the first governor of Tennessee. He was the namesake for the city of Sevierville, Tennessee.

George Washington Sevier Sr. (1858–1925) was elected as a member of the Madison Parish Police Jury. He served as the parish tax assessor from 1891 to 1916. Except for the years 1887–90, there has been at least one member of the Sevier family in public office for the 122 years preceding 2005. The family&#x27;s power was maintained primarily in the decades-long period when Democratic Party whites dominated voting, and Louisiana was virtually a one-party state. From its passage of a new constitution in 1898, the state legislature worked to disenfranchise African Americans, who were then mostly members of the Republican Party. They were systematically disenfranchised and nearly excluded from the political system until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century.

Under these conditions, Andrew Leonard Sevier Sr. was repeatedly re-elected as a Democratic member of the Louisiana State Senate, serving from 1932 until his death in 1962. His widow, the former Irene Newman Jordan, was appointed to serve the rest of his term. Andrew Jackson Sevier Jr. served as sheriff of Madison Parish from 1904 until his death in office in 1941. He was succeeded for the rest of his term by his widow, Mary Louise Day Sevier. A cousin of the Seviers, Henry Clay Sevier, was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1936 to 1952.

James D. Sevier Sr. and his son, also named James, held the office of tax assessor for more than four decades. Mason Spencer, husband of Rosa Sevier Spencer, represented Madison Parish in the Louisiana House from 1924 to 1936. He planned to run for governor of Louisiana in 1935 but withdrew his candidacy after the assassination of former governor Huey Pierce Long Jr.; Richard Leche of New Orleans, of the Long faction, won the office.

Among the political leaders from this family were William Putnam &quot;Buck&quot; Sevier Jr., a banker. He first served three terms as an elected town alderman in Tallulah. He was elected as mayor of the city in 1946 and served for nearly 30 years, from 1947 to 1974. His tenure included some of the volatile years of the civil rights movement, when African Americans sought changes to the Jim Crow system and justice as citizens. Sevier led white residents in adapting to change as more African-American citizens began to register, vote and be elected to local offices. Sevier at the time of his death held the record, at more than forty-four years, as the longest-serving publicly elected official in Louisiana.

==Detention and correction facilities==
In November 1994, the state opened the privately operated Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth on the western edge of the city. Residents hoped it would provide jobs for local people and aid the local economy, but there were soon problems associated with management of the facility, and the jobs there were low paying. In addition to problems within the facility, the prison seemed to have an adverse effect on the city. In 1999, the state took over operating the facility, renaming it the Swanson Correctional Center for Youth/Madison Parish Unit, but there continued to be problems with the treatment of youth.

A coalition of townspeople began to work on ideas for different uses for the land. The state decided to close the facility, and the coalition proposed an educational center instead. They gained legislative approval in one year, so when the juvenile prison was closed in 2004, there were plans developed for an educational center on the site. A bill for the Northeast Delta Learning Center was signed by Governor Kathleen Blanco in July 2004. Issues remaining were getting funding for it and offsetting a proposal to use the facility as an adult prison. Despite the desire of the townspeople, the facility was converted to house adult prisoners. It is known as the Madison Parish Louisiana Transitional Center for Women (LCTW), houses 535 inmates, and is operated by LaSalle Corrections, a private company.

Other related facilities in Tallulah, as it is the parish seat, are the Madison Parish Detention Center, with 264 inmates, and the Madison Parish Correctional Center, with 334 inmates. These are also operated by LaSalle Corrections.

==Geography==
Tallulah is in east-central Madison Parish in northeastern Louisiana. It is in the valley of the Mississippi River, southwest of the river itself. It is bordered to the south by the village of Richmond.

<text>Bastrop is a city in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is the parish seat of Morehouse Parish. The population was 9,691 at the 2020 census, down from 11,365 in 2010. The population of Bastrop is 76 percent African American. It is included in the Monroe Metropolitan Statistical Area and is part of the Monroe–Ruston Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Bastrop was founded by Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop, a Dutch businessman accused as an embezzler. He had fled to the then Spanish colony of Louisiana to escape prosecution and became involved in various land deals. In New Spain, he falsely claimed to be a nobleman. He received a large grant of land, provided that he could settle 450 families on it over the next several years. However, he was unable to do this, and so lost the grant. Afterwards, he moved to Texas, where he claimed to oppose the sale of Louisiana to the United States and became a minor government official. He proved instrumental in Moses Austin&#x27;s plan (and later, that of his son, Stephen F. Austin) to bring American colonists to what was then northern Mexico.

Bastrop formally incorporated in 1857, and is the commercial and industrial center of Morehouse Parish. In the 19th century, it was notable as the western edge of the great North Louisiana swamp, but more favorable terrain resulted in the antebellum rail line connecting to Monroe, further to the south.

Bastrop was a Confederate stronghold during the American Civil War until January 1865, when 3,000 cavalrymen led by Colonel Embury D. Osband of the 3rd United States Colored Cavalry Regiment, embarked from Memphis, Tennessee, for northeastern Louisiana.

During the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, Bastrop was the site of a relief camp for refugees. During World War II, it was the site of a German prisoner-of-war camp.

Bastrop is the parish seat of Morehouse Parish and is within an area marketed to tourists as the Sportsman&#x27;s Paradise Region of Louisiana. It is a Main Street Community and has received Transportation Enhancement funding for improvements in its historic district.

Celebrations and concerts are held in the historic downtown at the restored 1914 Morehouse Parish Courthouse and Rose Theater. Bastrop is home to the Snyder Museum and Creative Arts Center, housed in the circa 1929 home of a local family. Volunteers lead heritage appreciation tours for children and interpret the history of the parish using local artifacts.

At the Thursday night rehearsal for the graduation, senior Sarah Barlow included a prayer that explicitly mentioned Jesus Christ, and during the graduation, student Laci Mattice led people in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer before a moment of silence.

<text>Mer Rouge () is a Village in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, United States. The name is French for &quot;Red Sea&quot;. The population was 491 at the 2020 census, down from 628 in 2010.

== History ==
There is a hill that serves as a boundary between Mer Rouge and Bastrop, named &quot;Red Hill&quot;. According to legend, French settlers recognized the &quot;sea of red sedge&quot; between the bluffs to the north and west of the area. They called it Prarie Mer Rouge, or the &quot;red sea&quot; prairie.

On February 3, 1865, near the end of the American Civil War, two squadrons of the Illinois cavalry attacked Mer Rouge and, according to historian John D. Winters, seized some horses and mules, while also freeing some enslaved African-Americans. They then &quot;burned about 300,000 bushels of corn [and] some cotton&quot;, thus undermining the production power of the pro-slavery rebels.

In August 1922, in a case that would attract national attention, members of the Ku Klux Klan abducted two Mer Rouge men—Filmore Watt Daniel and Thomas Fletcher Richard—on the Bastrop highway. After torturing and killing the men, the Klansmen disposed of their bodies in nearby Lake Lafourche. Following the killings, Louisiana Governor John M. Parker sought help from the U.S. Department of Justice in suppressing Klan violence within the state.

On October 5th, 2014 a Norfolk Southern train crashed into a lowboy trailer hauling a tractor, seriously injuring both railroad crew and causing two engines along with 17 cars to derail. 50 homes were evacuated due to the leakage of argon gas from the tank car.

<text>Oak Ridge is a village in Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 124 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The earliest inhabitants of the area were different Native American societies that existed prior to European contact. Between 1540 and 1685 a multimound site with an adjoining central plaza was built. Since its archeological rediscovery, the area has come to be known as the Jordan Mounds. It is believed that by 1700 the site was abandoned, likely due to contact with explorers like Hernando de Soto.

Morehouse Parish was formed in 1844 after the result of an increasing population in the area. It is thought that a small farming community was formed near Oak Ridge&#x27;s modern location around this time. Cedars Plantation located at 4987 Lake Irwin Rd is considered the oldest surviving structure not just in the town, but the whole parish, built in 1840. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 19, 1976. It had been abandoned in 2008 after the last homeowner passed away, but in 2010 a proposal was created in order for the property to be restored.

Not much is known about the towns early history, but one surviving relic is a small wooden jail that is estimated to have been built in 1850. Simply known as the &quot;Oak Ridge, Louisiana Jail&quot;, it is believed to be the last surviving pre-Civil War wooden jail in the state. The existence of this jail hints at the fact that Oak Ridge may have served an administrative purpose for the parish at the time. It is written that &quot;the parish sheriff would use this jail to lock up free and enslaved men.&quot; The jail was eventually donated and now sits at the Louisiana State University - Rural Life Museum in Baton Rouge.
Oak Ridge was incorporated as a village in 1882.

The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 affected Oak Ridge much as it did the other states and towns within the Mississippi River Basin.

<doc id="115671" wikidata="Q2062091" url="?curid=115671" title="Campti, Louisiana">
<text>Campti is a town in the northern part of Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,056 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Natchitoches Micropolitan Statistical Area. Campti is a flat area of mostly farmland. It is located on the eastern bank of the Red River. Considerable herds of cattle are also raised in the general area.

== Etymology ==
Tradition maintains that the name &quot;Campti&quot; was derived from the name of a Natchitoches Indian chief, known to the French colonists as &quot;Le Roi Campti&quot; &quot;(The King Campti)&quot;. Church records in Natchitoches show that a French missionary, Père Valentin, visited the community of Campti around 1745. This was the first written record of Campti during the period of French Louisiana.

== History ==
The rural parish was developed for large cotton plantations, and a majority of the population were enslaved African Americans in the antebellum years. But by the time of the American Civil War, a number of free people of color also lived in Campti and the area. They were known to be related to several of the longtime white families, who acknowledged them, and they were generally well accepted. According to one authority on this area, they lived nearly as white. At least nine men of color, and likely more, enlisted in the Confederate Army during the Civil War and &quot;easily entered a predominately white military company.&quot;

During the war, Union Brigadier-General A. J. Smith, with two brigades, reached Campti to assist Rear-Admiral David D. Porter&#x27;s gunboats on the Red River there. Confederate Brigadier-General St. John R. Liddell&#x27;s scattered troops had been harassing the Union fleet but quickly retreated as Smith&#x27;s overwhelming force arrived on April 13, 1864. Smith and his men burned what was left of Campti, on April 14, 1864. The gunboats were returned safely upriver to Grand Ecore in Natchitoches Parish.

In the postwar years, cotton and agriculture continued as mainstays of the economy. Later cattle raising was introduced. Large-scale agriculture and ranching have reduced economic opportunities in the rural area. The population of Campti has continued to be majority African American, reflecting the history of its development.

<text>Natchitoches ( ; , ), officially the City of Natchitoches, is a small city in, and the parish seat of, Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, United States. At the 2020 United States Census, the city&#x27;s population was 18,039. it is the most populous city in Natchitoches Parish. Established in 1714 by Louis Juchereau de St. Denis as part of French Louisiana, the community was named after the indigenous Natchitoches people.

The City of Natchitoches was incorporated on February 5, 1819, after Louisiana had become a state in 1812. It is the oldest permanent settlement in the land acquired by the Louisiana Purchase. Natchitoches is home to Northwestern State University. Its sister city is Nacogdoches, Texas.

==History==
===Early years===
Natchitoches was established in 1714 by Canadien explorer Louis Juchereau de St. Denis. It is the oldest permanent European settlement within the borders of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. Natchitoches was founded as a French outpost on the Red River for trade with Spanish-controlled Mexico; French traders settled there as early as 1699. The post was established near a village of Natchitoches Indians, after whom the city was named. Early settlers were French Catholic immigrants and creoles (originally meaning those ethnic French born in the colony). French creoles acquired lands that were developed in the antebellum years as cotton-producing Magnolia Plantation and Oakland Plantation. Each has been preserved and is designated as a National Historic Landmark.

After the United States&#x27; Louisiana Purchase of 1803, migration into the territory increased from the US. Natchitoches grew along with the population in the parish. Initially, the Americans were primarily of English and Scots-Irish ancestry and of Protestant faith. They developed several cotton plantations along the Red River. Numerous enslaved African Americans were brought to the area through the domestic slave trade to work the cotton, and provide all other skills on these plantations, generating the revenues for the wealthy planters before the Civil War.

The United States Government established a federal fur trade factory here in 1805. It was removed to Sulphur Fork, Arkansas in 1818.

In the 1820s and early 1830s, Natchitoches also served as a freight transfer point for cotton shipped from parts of east Texas. Cotton shippers used a land route crossing the Sabine River to Natchitoches, where the freight was transferred to boats, and floated down the Red River to New Orleans.

When the course of the Red River shifted, it bypassed Natchitoches and cut off its lucrative connection with the Mississippi River. A oxbow lake was left in the river&#x27;s previous location which became known as Cane River Lake.

===Civil War===
During the Civil War, Natchitoches was set on fire by Union soldiers who retreated through the town after their failed attempt to capture Shreveport. Confederate cavalry pursued the fleeing soldiers and arrived in time to help extinguish the flames before the town was destroyed. Alexandria was destroyed by Union troops in 1864, but both Union and Confederate troops were responsible for severely damaging plantations along the river during the war, including Magnolia and Oakland.

Radford Blunt published the &quot;Natchitoches Republican&quot;. He was also a candidate for the state legislature. William H. Tunnard edited the paper.

===20th century===
As the parish seat, Natchitoches suffered from the decline in agricultural population through the mid-20th century, and grew at a markedly lower rate after 1960. The mechanization of agriculture had reduced the number of workers needed, and many moved to cities for jobs. By the early 1970s, the town&#x27;s businesses were declining, along with many area farms, and buildings were boarded up.

In the mid-1970s, Mayor Bobby DeBlieux and other preservationists believed that attracting tourists to the area, based on its historic assets of nearly intact plantations and numerous historic buildings, could be a key to attracting visitors, reviving the town, and stimulating new businesses. Over the years, he worked with a variety of landowners and local people to gain support for designating a historic district in the city. He also supported making a national park out of the working area of Magnolia Plantation, which had many surviving outbuildings from the 19th century, and from Oakland Plantation, both downriver in the parish.

By the end of the 20th century, the mile-long French colonial area of downtown, which lies along Cane Lake, was designated as a National Historic District. Many buildings were adapted as antique shops, restaurants and souvenir emporiums. To accommodate tourists, the town had 32 bed-and-breakfast inns, the highest in the state. By 2018, that number had increased to 50.

The plantation country surrounds Cane River Lake. The markedly intact downriver Magnolia and Oakland plantations were designated as National Historic Landmarks, and are part of what has been developed as the Cane River Creole National Historical Park, which was authorized in 1994, with the support of US Senator J. Bennett Johnston. He was a cousin by marriage of Betty Hertzog, the last of the family to live in the great house at Magnolia.

Tours and interpretive programs at both sites continue to attract visitors, especially as they grapple with telling the difficult history of slavery and its aftermath at the plantations. They also cover the contributions of blacks and Creoles of color to the community. In April 2022, the city council added Juneteenth as an official city holiday.

Since the late 20th century, Cane River Lake has served as the spring-break training location for numerous university crew teams, from universities such as the University of St. Thomas, Kansas State University, University of Kansas, Wichita State University, Murray State University, University of Central Oklahoma, and Washington University in St. Louis, as well as Northwestern State University. In the spring of 2018, LSU, Alabama, Texas and Georgia were also represented. Tourists interested in sports often visit in this period to watch the sports teams.

Over the years, the city and parish have improved conditions with a riverbank stabilization project and a water pump project to improve water levels in the lake. This directs water from Hampton Lake into Bayou Possiant, which feeds Cane River Lake.

====Notable events====
Natchitoches was the site of a gas pipeline explosion on March 4, 1965, that killed 17 people.

In 1973, singer-songwriter Jim Croce was killed when his plane crashed as it was leaving Natchitoches Regional Airport.

Natchitoches received numerous New Orleans evacuees due to Hurricane Katrina (2005). Many college students from New Orleans were transferred to Northwestern State University to continue their education.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and (14.21%) are covered by water.

A lake was formed from a portion of the Red River when it changed course. It is now known as Cane River Lake. The municipal water supply comes from nearby Sibley Lake, a formerly drained wetland dammed in 1962, which also offers fishing and boating.

===Geology===
Soils in this area are a combination of leaf mold and red clays, sand, and sediments. The area is part of the Chestnut Salt Dome.

===Cityscape===
Though Natchitoches has few multistorey buildings, it has retained much of its historic European-style architecture listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Natchitoches Historic District. The city is a mesh of wrought iron, stucco, and red brick. The city still has one of the original brick streets (Front Street), which the historical society protects from alterations. The city of Natchitoches recently completed a restoration project to repair the century-old brick street. During this process, workers removed each brick one by one, numbered it, cleaned it, and then replaced it after utilities, drainage, and the foundation were repaired beneath. 

===Climate===
Natchitoches lies in a boundary region that separates the plains of Texas from the consistently humid Gulf Coast. Summers are hot and humid. Winters in Natchitoches are relatively mild, with measurable snowfall once every 5–10 years. Natchitoches averages of rain per year. The city is in an area that frequently experiences severe thunderstorms, hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes.

<text>Monroe is the ninth-largest city in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and is the parish seat and largest city of Ouachita Parish. With a 2020 census-tabulated population of 47,702, it is the principal city of the Monroe metropolitan statistical area, the second-largest metropolitan area in North Louisiana. 

==Etymology==
As governor of Louisiana, Esteban Rodríguez Miró had &quot;Fort Miro&quot; built in 1791. Fort Miro changed its name to Monroe to commemorate the first arrival of the steamboat &quot;James Monroe&quot; in the spring of 1820. The ship&#x27;s arrival was the single event, in the minds of local residents, that transformed the outpost into a town.

Credit for the name is indirectly given to James Monroe of Virginia, the fifth President of the United States, for whom the ship was named. The steamboat is depicted in a mural at the main branch of the Ouachita Parish Public Library.

== History ==

===Early history–late 20th century===
Monroe&#x27;s origins date back to the Spanish colonial period.

Fort Miro changed its name to Monroe to commemorate the first arrival of the steamboat &quot;James Monroe&quot; in the spring of 1820 (see &quot;Etymology&quot; above).

In 1913, Joseph A. Biedenharn, the first bottler of Coca-Cola, moved to Monroe from Vicksburg, Mississippi. Biedenharn and his son Malcolm were among the founders of Delta Air Lines, originally Delta Dusters. That company was founded in Tallulah, Louisiana in Madison Parish. It was based on products and processes developed by the Agriculture Experimental Station to dust crops from airplanes in order to combat the devastating effects that the boll weevil had on cotton crops. Biedenharn&#x27;s home and gardens have been preserved and are now operated as the Biedenharn Museum and Gardens and are open to the public.

Collett E. Woolman, the Ouachita Parish agent, was originally from Indiana. He pioneered crop dusting to eradicate the boll weevil, which destroyed cotton throughout the Mississippi Delta in the early 20th century. Woolman originated the first crop-dusting service in the world. The collapse of cotton production meant a widespread loss of farm jobs, which contributed to the early-20th-century Great Migration, when a total of 1.5 million African-Americans left the rural South for jobs in northern and midwestern cities. They were also escaping the oppressive racial conditions and violence under Jim Crow and the disenfranchisement that excluded most blacks from the political system.

Howard D. Griffin (1911–1986) purchased a boat dealership in 1936 while a student at what became the University of Louisiana Monroe. By the 1960s, Griffin&#x27;s company had become the world&#x27;s largest outboard motor dealership, and he also sold motorcycles. From 1955 to 1985, Griffin and his wife, Birdie M. Griffin (1915–1985), operated their seasonal Land O&#x27; Toys store in Monroe.

==Infrastructure==
===National Guard===
Monroe is home to the 528th Engineer Battalion of the Louisiana Army National Guard. This unit is part of the 225th Engineer Brigade which is headquartered in Pineville, Louisiana at Louisiana National Guard Training Center Pineville.

===Transportation===
Monroe was the founding city of Delta Air Lines in the 1920s. As the airline expanded, it moved to Atlanta. Monroe Regional Airport serves the city and northeast Louisiana. It has three main runways and is served by regional partners of American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.

Greyhound Bus Lines provides transportation from Monroe to many cities across the nation. Monroe has the oldest municipally-owned transit system in the nation. Created in 1906 as a four-line street railroad, the Monroe Transit System now provides 13 fixed bus routes covering most areas of the city, and three demand-response buses serving the disabled.

Monroe can be accessed from Interstate 20, U.S. Highway 165, Louisiana Highway 15, U.S. Highway 80, and Interstate 420 (proposed).

Kansas City Southern, Union Pacific, BNSF, and Norfolk Southern serve freight traffic in the city.

The consultants declared West Monroe and the general area west of the Ouachita River overall as &quot;a clean, vibrant, growing friendly area ... [with] a small town atmosphere and yet ... many of the amenities and features of a [larger] city.&quot;

<text>Belle Chasse ( ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, United States, on the west bank of the Mississippi River.

It is home to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, a Naval Air Station for the U.S. Navy Reserve.

==History==

There is little consensus regarding the origin of the name Belle Chasse. In French, &quot;belle chasse&quot; literally means &quot;beautiful hunting.&quot; It is widely believed that it was so named due to the richness of wildlife which the initial French colonists observed when they settled in the region. Others say that Belle Chasse was named after a Colonel Joseph D. Bellechasse, who lived in New Orleans around the late 18th and early 19th century. Alternatively, it was named after the plantation of Deville de Goutin Bellechasse.

The Confederate Judah P. Benjamin was the most famous owner of the Belle Chasse plantation. After falling into decay and abandonment by the 1930s, the landmark plantation house was demolished in 1960. The bell was salvaged and today is in front of the Belle Chasse Public Library.

The Naval Air Station was founded in 1920 on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain, but in 1957 it relocated to its current location (Belle Chasse, Louisiana). It has been designated as a Joint Forces Reserve Air Station. It is home to various naval air units as well as an Air Force Reserve fighter squadron and a Marine Corps Reserve helicopter unit. In March 2009, U.S. Navy Reserve Airborne Early Warning Squadron 77 (VAW-77) relocated its six E-2C aircraft from NAS Atlanta, GA to Belle Chasse. The squadron routinely deploys to the Caribbean on counter-narcotic operations.

<doc id="115689" wikidata="Q2447914" url="?curid=115689" title="Buras-Triumph, Louisiana">
<text>Buras-Triumph is a former census-designated place in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 3,358 at the 2000 census. For the 2010 census, Buras-Triumph was split into the CDPs of Buras and Triumph. On the peninsula, Buras has been located higher, with Triumph located southeast of Buras.

==History==

The town of Buras was established, informally, in the 1840s. Several small settlements on the West Bank of the Mississippi River north of Fort Jackson became known collectively as the Quartiers des Burats, the Burat Settlement, anchored on the property of Sebastian Burat, near where Cazezu Boulevard meets Parish Highway 11 today. Burat was later anglicized to Buras. In 1854, the Buras Post Office was established, along with a regular mail route by packet boat on the river. By 1864, a new church, Our Lady of Good Harbor, was established in Buras as the community grew.

=== Civil War ===
In April 1862, during the American Civil War, the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip took place near Buras. Union Flag Officer David Farragut led a fleet up the river to capture New Orleans and engaged the forts in the early morning hours of April 23. A single Union vessel, the USS &quot;Varuna&quot;, was sunk near Buras in an engagement with the Confederate steamer &quot;CSS Governor Moore&quot; and the &quot;CSS Stonewall Jackson&quot;. The heavily damaged &quot;Governor Moore&quot; also sank, not far from its Union opponent.

=== 20th century ===

In the first decades of the 20th century, Buras&#x27; primary industries were oyster fishing and citrus farming. In the 1930s, petroleum was discovered in the region, along with natural gas and sulfur. One of the first producing fields was established in Quarantine Bay, east of Buras, by the Gulf Oil Company. With the coming of the oil and gas industries, Buras began to slowly evolve from a farming and fishing village into a larger community.

=== Hurricanes ===

Buras-Triumph and the surrounding communities have been subjected to many devastating hurricanes over the years, including the 1893 Cheniere Caminada hurricane, which destroyed the original church, the 1901 Louisiana hurricane, the 1915 New Orleans hurricane, Hurricane Betsy in 1965, and Hurricane Camille in 1969.

More recently, this area was the location where, on August 29, 2005, the eye of Hurricane Katrina first made landfall in Louisiana. Although Katrina was one of the costliest natural disasters to strike the U.S., according to the Hurricane Severity Index, at landfall both Betsy and Camille were higher-intensity hurricanes than Katrina. However, the loss of surrounding marsh lands to erosion and subsidence allowed the energy of Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s storm surge to overtop the levee system and the area was devastated yet again.

Emblematic of the rebuilding and recovery is the new Buras water tower. The image of the previous tower, collapsed in the rubble, was an icon of the destruction Katrina brought. (See photos.)

<text>Empire is a census-designated place (CDP) in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 905 at the 2020 census.

==Seafood production==

Empire, along with Venice, is the third largest seafood port in the United States by weight and value(Landings by Port Ranked by Pounds, NOAA, 2016). Some two thousand boats home port from Empire. Species landed include oysters, shrimp, menhaden, and other types of fin fish. During the BP oil spill, seafood landings came to a halt. Oyster landings did not resume for an entire year. Under the Coast 2050 plan, a 50,000 cfs freshwater diversion is proposed at Empire, which threatens the livelihood of the fishermen and the supporting businesses by drastically altering the salinity in the surrounding marshes.

==Hurricane Katrina==
During the afternoon of August 28, 2005, Hurricane Katrina approached the northern coastline of the Gulf of Mexico, generating tropical force winds along coastal areas of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. At 6:10 a.m., on August 29, 2005, Katrina made landfall just a few miles southeast of Empire, at Buras-Triumph. Many shrimp and oyster boats were grounded along the roads and levees near Empire. On the morning of August 29, the eye of the storm passed over Empire. The area was entirely flooded, causing dozens of boats that had popped their moorings to settle near the southern foot of the Empire High Rise Bridge. As a result, all traffic coming into or out of southern Plaquemines Parish was routed over the draw bridge on Parish Highway 11 (the old alignment of Louisiana Highway 23). Many notable businesses such as Tom&#x27;s Place Oyster Bar and The Delta Marina were destroyed.

==Geography==
Empire is located at (29.398586, -89.608501) and has an elevation of .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (31.49%) is water.

==Education==

<doc id="115691" wikidata="Q2392574" url="?curid=115691" title="Port Sulphur, Louisiana">
<text>Port Sulphur is a unincorporated community on the West Bank of the Mississippi River in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, United States. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined the community as a census-designated place (CDP) which at the 2020 census, it had a population of 1,677.

== Etymology ==
The name for the community derives from the Freeport Sulphur Company in the early 1930s, when it set up logistics, refining, storage and shipping operations to support its Frasch Process sulphur mine at Lake Grande Ecaille, located 10 miles west of the town in the nearby marsh. The Grande Ecaille mine was the largest sulphur deposit in the world when it began operation in 1933, and remained in production until 1978. Over time, as other discoveries were made, the Freeport Sulphur Company also used the Port Sulphur facility to support their other Frasch Process sulphur mines located at Garden Island Bay, Lake Pelto, and Caillou Island; a land-based mine at Chacahoula; the first offshore sulphur mines at Grand Isle and Caminada Pass; and a large operation 50 miles offshore from the Mississippi River Delta in 300 feet of water, at Main Pass Block 299 in the Gulf of Mexico. The facility was also used to process and ship recovered sulphur obtained by oil and gas refining. The terminal was able to filter and store liquid hot molten sulphur in large insulated heated tanks, and &quot;vat&quot; liquid sulphur into acres of long term dry storage by forming blocks of bright yellow sulphur by spraying molten sulphur into metal forms on the ground and allowing to cool. The site is valuable because of its proximity to sulphur producing areas near the Gulf of Mexico, its docking sites along the Mississippi River and back bay marsh.

==History==
Port Sulphur was originally a typical company town, with its residents and civic life closely tied to the Freeport Sulphur Company. As the company divested itself of much of the town property and governance, it became more of a regular town with private individual land ownership. As the number of employees at the site dwindled, the Freeport Company became less important in everyday life and economic activity. At some point, most of the company-owned land not necessary for the sulphur operation was transferred to Plaquemines Parish or sold to private owners. The economic fortunes of the Freeport Sulphur Company declined during the 1980s and 1990s, resulting from the competitive forces of recovered Sulphur processed from sour oil &amp; gas. In the early 2000s Freeport Sulphur shut down operations, as the price of sulphur dropped too low because large amounts of sulphur recovered during petroleum refining and from Canadian natural gas exploration were dumped on the international sulphur market. With inexpensive recovered sulphur in large supply, the large scale and expensive Frasch Process sulphur mining and storage operations proved to be uneconomical and were discontinued. The Freeport-McMoRan Port Sulphur facility was closed and sold. Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of what was left of the sulphur facility in August 2005, with a few buildings remaining.
The large brick Plaquemines Parish Government building located on Louisiana Highway 23 (LA 23) in town next to the former Freeport property was originally the Freeport Sulphur Company administration building. The Port Sulphur school and other buildings located around the Civic Drive area were originally located on company property and are oriented towards the former Freeport Property. Much of the original town buildings were sold or removed, and much of the original town site sits mostly vacant empty land, with a large stand of oak trees on the former Freeport Property next to the Plaquemines Government building. An historical marker about Port Sulphur is located in front of the Government Building. The golf course land located on LA 23, just south of the former Freeport property, was originally a neighborhood of the company townsite. The land was later donated to the Plaquemines Parish Government.

The town began to struggle economically after Freeport Sulphur Mine ended its business in the town.
The town is above sea level and had not flooded during Hurricane Betsy nor Hurricane Camille. Before Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita about 3,000 people lived in Port Sulphur. Nevertheless, during Hurricane Katrina, the federal levees failed and around of water engulfed the town. Almost all single-family homes in the town were destroyed, many of which were moved off their foundations by as much as 100 feet. In the months following Katrina, some residents moved back to Port Sulphur in trailers and modular homes provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But many residents relocated to other parts of Louisiana, the Southeast, and Texas.

By November 2006, in the post-Katrina period, the post office and several businesses had reopened, and Highway 23 had some street lights added. By December 2007 there were about 1,500 residents of Port Sulphur and the majority of the small businesses resumed operations. Due to the usage of modular buildings and trailers in the period, Jeré Longman described it as &quot;a feel of impermanence and uncertainty.&quot;

<text>Fordoche (pronounced four-DOASH) is a town in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 928 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1854, the first post office was established at Fordoche, with Thomas Farrar designated as its first postmaster. There are two conflicting stories about how the town&#x27;s name was derived. One story suggests that it received its name from a Caddo Indian word meaning &quot;wild animal lair&quot; (i.e., the bed of a wild beast) and the other claims that it is named after a Louisiana French term for underbrush found in bayou bottom.

At least two American Civil War battles were fought in and around Fordoche. The Battle of Fordoche Bridge was fought in September 1863. Union troops were sent to prevent the Confederacy from operating in the upper Atchafalaya but the Confederates were successful in driving back the Union forces.

In May 1864, the Confederates were again victorious over the Union troops at the &quot;Skirmish on Bayou Fordoche Road&quot;.

The area saw an influx of Italian immigrants after 1890.

Fordoche is the most recently incorporated community in Pointe Coupee Parish. It was incorporated as a village in 1961 and became a town in 1994.

With a base of 165 feet and nearly 31 (30.7) feet tall, is the tallest of 10 remaining Indian burial mounds in Pointe Coupee Parish. Dated to the Coles Creek archaeological culture (400AD-1100AD) period, the mound sits between La 77 and La 78, 150 feet from Bayou Grosse Tête. A second low-rise unnamed mound (destroyed by the mid-1900s) is located 200 feet southeast and a third was reportedly south of these on the water&#x27;s edge.

===Colonial history===

France ruled the Livonia area as part of Louisiana from 1699 to 1763, when the area was ceded to Spain. Spain controlled the area until 1800 when Napoleon took control of Louisiana for France. Some French Canadians migrated to Louisiana earlier, but the majority came between 1755 and 1764 after being expelled from Acadia. Some of the French culture remains in Livonia, as shown by the 2000 census that revealed 5.6% of the parish spoke French, Cajun French, or Louisiana Creole French. The land was sold to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase.

===Foundation===
The Post office opened 1846 and was named by first postmaster James B. Johnson for his native Livonia, Pennsylvania.

==Geography==

<doc id="115694" wikidata="Q1436146" url="?curid=115694" title="Morganza, Louisiana">
<text>Morganza is an incorporated village near the Mississippi River in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 610 at the 2010 census, down from 659 in 2000. As of 2020 the population was 525. It is part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area. The village&#x27;s zip code is 70759. The Morganza Spillway, a flood control structure between the Mississippi River and the Atchafalaya Basin, is located nearby.

==History==

Morganza takes its name from Morganza Plantation, the antebellum holding of Charles Morgan, an early surveyor, political figure and first American sheriff of Pointe Coupee Parish. Morgan, the son of James Morgan from a town of the family&#x27;s name in Sayreville, New Jersey, and a captain in the Second Regiment of the Middlesex County (N.J.) militia during the Revolutionary War. Evidence indicates he was involved in the transfer of slaves from New Jersey to Louisiana in conflict with New Jersey law. The U.S. Post Office opened in 1847, closed some years later, and reopened in 1899. Members of the Campbell family held the position of postmaster until 1970. The town was not incorporated until 1908.

Morganza was the site of a Union Army encampment during the American Civil War. The largest battle in Pointe Coupee Parish was fought at nearby Stirling Plantation, on September 29, 1863. Sixteen Federal troops were killed, 45 were wounded, and 462 were taken prisoner. The Confederate losses included 26 dead, 85 wounded, and 10 missing. Although the Battle of Sterling Plantation was a Confederate victory, the Union troops burned the town of Morganza to the ground on October 1, 1863.

Historian John D. Winters in &quot;The Civil War in Louisiana&quot; (1963) documents the arrival in May 1864 of Federal troops in Morganza under General Nathaniel P. Banks, recently defeated in the Battle of Mansfield in DeSoto Parish and abandoning the Red River Campaign. According to Winters, conditions were miserable, with extreme heat, excessive rainfall, and epidemics of various illnesses.

To commemorate the centennial anniversary of the Village of Morganza, U.S. Congressman Rodney Alexander entered a speech about the village into the Congressional Record on December 10, 2008.

===Periodic flooding===
Located at the lower end of a sharp bend of the Mississippi River, Morganza has been subjected to flooding by the great river a number of times. Levee breaches or &quot;crevasses&quot; occurred at Morganza and Grand Levee just downriver in 1850, 1865, 1867, and 1890. The Morganza Spillway, a major flood diversion project of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is located immediately north of the town. Construction on this mammoth work began in 1939 and was completed in 1955. High water of the Mississippi is channeled between guide levees north and west of the town of Morganza and down into the Atchafalaya Basin, thence to the Gulf of Mexico. The floodgates of this facility have been used only twice—during the high water of 1973 and 2011. The structure will be used again in the summer of 2019.

==Geography==
Morganza is located at (30.735681, -91.593390).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (15.11%) is water.

===Climate===
Climate is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The coldest month is usually quite mild, although frosts are not uncommon, and winter precipitation is derived primarily from frontal cyclones along the polar front. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfa&quot;. (Humid Subtropical Climate). 
==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 659 people, 264 households, and 191 families residing in the village. By 2020, its population was 525.

==Government==
The Village of Morganza is a municipality led by an elected Mayor along with three Council members. Clarence &quot;Woots&quot; Wells took office as Mayor in January 2019. His Council consists of Paul Wells, Julie Langlois, and Elton Savoy Jr. The Mayor and Council hold a public meeting at the town hall on the first Tuesday of every month.

The Morganza Police Department patrols an area of approximately . The head of this agency is an appointed official, with the position currently held by Chief of Police Mark Ramagos. The department&#x27;s main office is located at 112 LA Highway 3050. Its main area of responsibility is law enforcement and community service within the corporate limits of the Village of Morganza, although its officers are occasionally tasked to assist other area police agencies such as the Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Office, the Louisiana State Police, and Louisiana Wildlife &amp; Fisheries. The Morganza Police Department has a strong traffic enforcement presence along Louisiana Highway 1 and Louisiana Highway 10.

==Media==
The town features in the 1969 film Easy Rider, where the main characters are subjected to ridicule from townsfolk in a local restaurant. Several scenes in the movie were filmed on location in Morganza. The old restaurant building was demolished in 2016, but is commemorated with a plaque in the sidewalk.

<text>New Roads (historically ) is a city in and the parish seat of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, United States. The center of population of Louisiana was located in New Roads in 2000. The population was 4,831 at the 2010 census, down from 4,966 in 2000. In the 2020 census the population was 4,549, while at the beginning year of 2023 the census showed a population of 4,205 and expects to be under 4,000 by the years end. The city&#x27;s ZIP code is 70760. It is part of the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
&quot;Le Poste de Pointe Coupée&quot; (&quot;the Pointe Coupée Post&quot; or Cut Point Post) is one of the oldest communities in the Mississippi River Valley established by European colonists. The trading post was founded in the 1720s by settlers from France. It was located upstream from the point crossed by explorers, immediately above but not circled by False River. The name referred to the area along the Mississippi River northeast of what is now New Roads.

The post was initially settled by native French, as well as French-speaking Creoles born in the colony. Additional ethnically French settlers migrated down the Mississippi River from Fort de Chartres, Upper Louisiana. The colonists imported numerous African slaves from the French West Indies (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Domingue), and many directly from Africa, as workers for the plantations.

Historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall discovered extensive French and Spanish documentation of the early slave trade, which provided more information than is usually available as to the ethnicity and names of individual slaves, all in the court house at New Roads. Using this and other research, she has produced &quot;The Louisiana Slave Database and the Louisiana Free Database: 1719–1820,&quot; which is searchable on line.

=== Spanish rule ===
After several floods, Governor Luis de Unzaga in 1772 moved the European settlement from Pointe Coupee to a new post, the so-called Post Unzaga. Recently, historians Frank Cazorla and J. David Polo, from the Louis de Unzaga Historical Society research team, using satellite remote sensing techniques and comparative plans from the General Archive of the Indies, have managed to locate the position of the Unzaga post, which included, along with it, a parish. Unfortunately after the slave rebellion of 1795 this settlement was left uninhabited.

After Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War (also known as the French and Indian War in North America), France ceded this territory to Spain. About 1776, the Spanish built a &quot;Chemin Neuf&quot;, French for &quot;New Road,&quot; connecting the Mississippi River with False River, a long oxbow lake and formerly the main channel of the Mississippi.

In 1791, the Mina (an African people) slave uprising, the Mina Conspiracy, started on the estate of Widow Robillard at New Roads. Three years later, there was another area slave revolt near Point Coupee, the Pointe Coupée Conspiracy.

=== Louisiana Purchase ===
In 1803 the United States made the Louisiana Purchase, and the territory became part of the United States. In-migration of American settlers increased, changing Louisiana culture.

In 1822, Catherine Dispau (a free woman of color called &quot;La Fille Gougis&quot;) made a four or six block subdivision out of her False River plantation. This was located at the terminus of a &quot;new road&quot; linking False River with the older Mississippi River settlement to the north. This is the area now bounded by West Main, New Roads, West Second and St. Mary Streets. The latter was named for St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church, founded in 1823. The community was referred to variously as the &quot;village of St. Mary&quot; or Chemin Neuf.

The founding of the church helped the community develop. In 1847, New Roads was named as the seat of Pointe Coupée Parish, and a courthouse was built. Between these &quot;strong celestial poles,&quot; the Main Street business district developed. After the abandonment of the competing parish port of Waterloo during 1882–84 due to flooding, New Roads became the major commercial port and city of Pointe Coupée Parish. The railroad reached the city in 1898–99, bringing much industrial development.

The official name of the community changed frequently during the years after Louisiana became part of the United States. The first post office was established in 1858 as &quot;False River,&quot; but it was discontinued in 1861. When the town was incorporated by the state legislature in 1875, it was named &quot;New Roads.&quot; But, in 1878, when the post office reopened, it was named &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s.&quot; In 1879, the city and post office name was changed to New Roads. The old incorporation fell into disuse. The city was reincorporated in 1892, and received its charter two years later. Several names were proposed, among them &quot;St. Mary&quot; and &quot;Rose Lake.&quot; But &quot;New Roads&quot; was finally chosen, although it was often misspelled &quot;New Rhodes.&quot;

Since its founding, New Roads has been the hub of an agricultural community that cultivated commodity crops of sugar cane, cotton, and pecans, among others. Today, the economy has grown to support large industries such as healthcare and social assistance, construction, and retail facilities.

==Geography==
New Roads is located at (30.696305, -91.438980) and has an elevation of .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Gradually sloping from a high of above sea level on Main Street immediately adjacent to False River to a low of along Portage Canal in the north, the city lies on a Mississippi River flood-plain but has never flooded to any great extent since 1912. Levee breaks or &quot;crevasses&quot; on the Mississippi River to the north and east overbanked False River and submerged all of New Roads in 1867, 1882 and 1884. The 1882 flood was the most severe, with four feet of water standing in Main Street during the height of the crisis. During the floods of 1912 and 1927, however, the southern portion of the town, including the main business district, remained dry, as the flood waters to the north and east were held back by the Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad embankment. Mid-city flooding had periodically occurred during hurricanes and other heavy rainfall events due to the overbanking of the Portage Canal, the lowest part of the city.

== Government ==
From 1960 to 1978, the mayor of New Roads was William Haile &quot;Booty&quot; Scott, Sr. During his administration, New Roads and the Pointe Coupee Parish Police Jury acquired property on which to construct facilities. Scott died in office in 1978.

Scott&#x27;s wife, Trina Olinde Scott (1920-2016), was appointed to fill out his term, becoming New Roads&#x27; first female mayor. She was thereafter elected to two full terms of her own. A former educator who attended H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College in New Orleans and Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Trina Scott helped revitalize Main Street, increase the size and effectiveness of the police force, and expand the municipal boundaries. Under her administration, New Roads was elevated from town to city status and the city and parish erected the Scott Civic Center, False River Regional Airport, playgrounds, and sports parks.

Scott was succeeded by Sylvester Muckelroy, the first African American to hold the office.

In 2010, Robert Myer, also an African American, was elected mayor. On August 3, 2016, Myer was indicted by a Pointe Coupee Parish grand jury on nine counts of malfeasance in office and abuse of power. From 2011 to 2014, Myer allegedly used a city-issued credit card for personal reasons. He also allegedly permitted the former municipal finance director to use the card in exchange for sexual favors.

<text>Ball is a town in Rapides Parish, just north of Pineville, Louisiana, United States. Established in 1972, it is part of the Alexandria, Louisiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,000 at the 2010 census, an increase of 8.7 percent over the 2000 tabulation of 3,681.

==History==
Ball had its start as a logging town with a sawmill.

The earliest record of settlers in Ball dates to between 1840 and 1863. In 1893 Captain Chittenden Edwin Ball, a native of Union County, Kentucky, who captained steamboats up the Red River to Alexandria, named a sawmill town after himself. The captain settled in Rapides Parish in the late 1880s, where he established the Sweet Home Mill. In 1940 Camp Livingston was constructed, bringing with it job opportunities and a population boom. The number of military personnel stationed at Camp Livingston reached a peak of 42,500 in 1942. The end of World War II in 1945 brought about the closing of the base but many families decided to stay in the community. Discussion of incorporation began in the 1960s and in May 1972 incorporation was completed with the finalization of the town charter under &quot;The Lawrason Act&quot;.

In 2011, former mayor Roy Hebron, a Democrat, was sentenced to four years imprisonment for corruption. Hebron intended to return to the office after his election on November 6, 2018, when he handily unseated the Republican incumbent, Neil S. Kavanagh, 817 (56 percent) to 380 (26 percent). Another 254 votes (18 percent) went to a second Republican candidate, Gene Decker. However, Hebron was unable to be sworn in because of a constitutional amendment passed in the November 2018 election which prevents felons from holding office for five years after the conclusion of their sentences.

<text>Boyce is a town in northern Rapides Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is part of the Alexandria, Louisiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 888 at the 2020 census. The community is nearly 70 percent African American.

==History==

Originally called Cotile Landing, the name was changed to Boyce in 1880, when the Texas and Pacific Railroad made Boyce its terminal point. The town was named for Judge Henry Boyce, who owned the land on which the town was located. Being of Irish descent, Boyce, and/or his son Henry Archinard Boyce, gave all the streets Irish names as he did his own cotton farmland, Ulster, which was immediately adjacent to the town along Bayou Jeunes des Gens (Jean de Jean). The post office was moved more than once but was returned to Boyce in 1883 and the Postal Service chose Boyce, even though there was a majority opposition, because the train depot already carried that name. Under charter of May 7, 1887, Boyce was organized and a council elected.

== Geography ==
Boyce is located at (31.386778, -92.670577).

He won races at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. During the days of the Lecompte High School, the yearbook was named &quot;The LeComte&quot; with a picture of the horse on the first page. When the railroad company painted a sign for the town on the side of the train depot, a &quot;p&quot; was accidentally added to the name and it has remained there ever since. The horse was named after horse breeder Ambrose LeComte who lived in the area and was a great lover of fine stock and owner of a fine string of race horses.

<text>McNary is a village in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is part of the Alexandria, Louisiana, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 211 at the 2000 census.

McNary was established as a company lumber town that grew to a population of around 3,000 with a hospital, several stores, a theater, and even a pool. When the lumber played out the lumber company purchased a town in Arizona and moved the entire mill operation to what was renamed as McNary, Arizona. The community in Louisiana struggled but has survived as an incorporated village.

==History==
By 1880 railroads were arriving and an industrial lumber boom began in Louisiana. Around 22 million acres were in virgin pine which was 85% of the state&#x27;s land area. There were also large virgin Cyprus stands but these were mainly in swamp or coastal marsh lands. McNary began, as with many towns created along the railroads in Louisiana, as a lumber town. William M. Cady of Cady Lumber Company, along with Alfred Smith and James McNary, established a lumber mill in McNary. A town of around 3000 sprang up with all the amenities of larger towns including a theater, hospital, and swimming pool. During the first part of the 1920s mills starting cutting out. By 1923 the McNary reserves were depleted but what followed next was not atypical of most mills. The Cady Lumber Company purchased the Apache Lumber Company, Ponderosa Pine leases, the Apache Railway, and the sawmill in Cooley, Arizona, then moved the entire McNary mill with people in a twenty-one coach train. The new lumber town would come to be named McNary, Arizona. After the lumber mill left the area the community struggled but did not become a ghost town. In 1929 the town charter became inactive and it was not until 1965 that it was reactivated. Today parts of the Cady mill can still be seen in the area.

<text>Woodworth is a town in Rapides Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is part of the Alexandria, Louisiana Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,096 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Woodworth was established in 1942 under the Lawrason Act.

The town began with a small population in the 1880s with the first significant resident being George Hendricks from Arkansas who allegedly built a rice farm in the village, but later found himself unsuccessful and left.

The town&#x27;s growth did not yet stop, as a businessman named John McEnery came from New Orleans and brought his railroad company (New Orleans Pacific Railroad) with him. McEnery did not have this land for long however as he later sold it, and on November 25, 1890, the 18,000 acres of land were sold to three people: C. E. Roberts, C. S. Woodworth, and Ed Rand all of whom were from neighboring state of Texas. The three men had yet to explore this land but established the Rapides Lumber Company in the village, constructing a sawmill. The name of this town originates from C. S. Woodworth’s name of whom the company decided the community should be named after.`

Soon after the sawmill was constructed, a Missouri located company bought out positions of the lumber company being those held by C. S. Woodworth and C. E. Roberts, but Rand kept his position. Because of these transfers, the company was renamed to the Long-Bell Lumber Company of Woodworth. By the early 1900s, the town of Woodworth had reached a population of roughly 1,000, while continuous expansion of the town&#x27;s businesses and services began, which oversaw the construction of churches and commercial businesses in the town. As this happened, the first Catholic Church was constructed in Woodworth after Bishop Van de Ven blessed a chapel in the town. The land where this chapel was had later been owned by Richard and Edward Butler, which then was passed over to Henry Butler on November 19, 1908. On June 15, 1911, the 2 acre land was finally inherited by Bishop Van de Ven. The Butler family is related to the current leading Woodworth political family, the Butlers. The Butler family is currently overseeing David Butler as mayor of the town.

As this church continued to grow, so did the population. The Catholic Church invited the large Catholic population of Rapides Parish towards Woodworth after the exponential growth of the sawmill. This also attracted a certain Catholic family, the Moore family, which was a family consisting of a former slave and the descendants of the freed slave. Alvah Joseph Moore moved to the town in the early 1900&#x27;s, and was a prominent saw mill operator and musician who played in the Woodworth Band. Moore and his family wrote recollections of the era in Woodworth and their life in the town. During the period of Catholic migration to the town, the Ku Klux Klan also rose to prominence in the town, as conflicts between the two groups began arising in the town, which eventually was put to a stop after the sawmill company intervened.

After the conflicts between the Catholics and Ku Klux Klan ended, the sawmill eventually began seeing less and less production in the region and eventually moved out in 1926, leaving the land barren until restoration during the Civilian Conservation Corps program. The Catholic church was relocated to Reddell, Louisiana which signaled the loss of many Catholic residents of the town.

Following the closure of the sawmill, and the relocation of several Catholic residents, the town seemed to stop growing until the war era. As of now, Catholic residents were attending St. Martin&#x27;s Church in Lecompte, Louisiana Following the closure of the church, Father Gerard J. Ducote, the second pastor of Cabrini, sent a letter to Bishop Charles P. Greco saying: &quot;I understand from Mr. and Mrs. A.J. Moore that there have been no Catholic services in Woodworth since about 1927, the year in which they left the community to reside in Alexandria, and that the reason why so many of these people have not continued active affiliation with the Church was because of resentment that their Church had been dismantled and moved away - a measure of protest over the action.&quot; The Catholic Churches were then promised double attendance, which was reached but mainly as result of the heavy growth of Camp Claiborne inhabitants.

Camp Claiborne was also formed in Louisiana and rose to higher prominence during World War II, where over half a million men circulated through the camp. The camp oversaw the Louisiana Maneuvers training which was led by many prominent military and later political members including General Omar Bradley, General Ben Lear, and Walter Krueger, just to name a few. Eventually, this camp was then used for German military POWs. After the war, the camp was acquired by the United States Forest Service. The United States Army Corps of Engineers also has jurisdiction there regarding unexploded ordnance

<text>Coushatta is a town in, and the parish seat of, rural Red River Parish in north Louisiana, United States. It is situated on the east bank of the Red River. The community is approximately 45 miles south of Shreveport on U.S. Highway 71. The population, 2,299 at the 2000 census, is nearly two-thirds African American, most with long family histories in the area. The 2010 census, however, reported 1,964 residents, a decline of 335 persons, or nearly 15 percent during the course of the preceding decade. In 2020, its population was 1,752. The city is named after the Coushatta, a Native American nation indigenous to the region.

==History==
Red River Parish and the Red River Valley were areas of unrest and white paramilitary activity and violence after the Civil War, and especially during the 1870s of Reconstruction. The parish developed around cotton cultivation and enslaved African Americans who far outnumbered the whites. After the war, white planters and farmers tried to reestablish dominance over a majority of the population. With emancipation and being granted citizenship and suffrage, African Americans tried to create their own lives.

Formed in May 1874 from white militias, the White League in Louisiana was increasingly well-organized in rural areas like Red River Parish. It worked to turn out the Democratic Party, as well as suppress freedmen&#x27;s civil rights and voting rights. It used violence against officeholders, running some out of town and killing others, and acted near elections to suppress black and white Republican voter turnout.

In one of the more flagrant examples of violence, the White League in August 1874 captured six Republican officials in Coushatta, made them sign a pledge to leave the state, and escorted them when they were assassinated on their departure from the state. Victims included the brother and three brothers-in-law of the Republican State Senator Marshall H. Twitchell. Twitchell&#x27;s wife and her brothers were from a family with long ties in Red River Parish. One of Twitchell&#x27;s several biographies is an unpublished 1969 dissertation at Mississippi State University in Starkville by the historian Jimmy G. Shoalmire, a Shreveport native and a specialist in Reconstruction studies.

The White League also killed five to twenty freedmen who had been escorting the Republicans and were witnesses to the assassinations. The events became known as the Coushatta Massacre and contributed to the Republican governor&#x27;s requesting more Federal troops from U.S. President U.S. Grant to help control the state. Ordinary Southerners wrote to the White House describing the terrible conditions and fear they lived under during these years.

With increased fraud, violence and intimidation, white Redeemer Democrats gained control of the state legislature in 1876 and established a new system of one-party rule.

<text>Delhi (), originally called Deerfield, is a town in Richland Parish, Louisiana, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 2,622.

==History==
In 1890, the Delhi Institute was founded in Delhi, Louisiana; a Black private school affiliated with the A.M.E. church. Delhi Institute was renamed to Lampton College; after a 1907 fire, the campus was moved to Alexandria, Louisiana, before being absorbed sometime after 1945 by Campbell College in Jackson, Mississippi.

In the 1940s, Delhi was the center of a large natural gas boom. Numerous workers came to work in the industry. Several functioning gas fields still surround the town.

From 1968 until 1969, Delhi Fire Department was home to the now defunct Louisiana State Police - Troop O. The site was abandoned in 1969 after thirteen months&#x27; operation, with state services reverting to Troop F in Monroe.

On February 21, 1971, as part of the February 1971 Mississippi Delta tornado outbreak, Louisiana&#x27;s only recorded F5 tornado struck outside of Delhi. It resulted in forty-seven deaths and was the deadliest F5 tornado to hit the United States since the Jackson, Mississippi, Candlestick Park tornado in 1966. It was the earliest confirmed F5 tornado during a year.

==Geography==

<doc id="115720" wikidata="Q2526883" url="?curid=115720" title="Zwolle, Louisiana">
<text>Zwolle ( ) is a small town in Sabine Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,759 at the 2010 census, down from 1,783 in 2000. It was named after Zwolle, a Dutch city and the capital of the province Overijssel.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the bowl-shaped area of land upon which the town of Zwolle is situated were the Mound Builders. Lured here for protection from storms, the &quot;bowl&quot; offered them protection. Prehistoric people built the dome-shaped mounds that line the banks of Bayou Scie and Bayou San Miguel, which form a hollow circle around the townsite. As Mound Builders, they were ancestors of North American Indians who inhabited the territory when the Europeans arrived.

Later, the area was colonized by Spain, which sent the earliest non-Indians to the territory. Las Cabezas, a Spanish mission church was built at Bayou Scie. Spanish soldiers and Native people intermarried over many generations, and Spanish was still spoken in the area until the 1970s. The town was originally called , which became the source of the name Bayou Scie.

The first English-speaking settlers arrived in Sabine Parish in 1824, &quot;via&quot; Natchitoches. These pioneers came chiefly from Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas. In 1871, many more of these settlers moved in and acquired land under the homestead act.
Arthur Stilwell built the Kansas City Southern Railroad (KCS) from Kansas City to Port Arthur, Texas. He had reached Van Buren, Arkansas, in 1893 when he ran out of funds. Stilwell went to Zwolle, the Netherlands, and met with a rich coffee merchant Jan De Goeijen. About 1896, Stilwell and De Goeijen were plotting a route to extend the KCS railway to the Gulf of Mexico. While visiting the area destined to become Zwolle, De Goeijen was impressed with St. Joseph Catholic Church. St. Joseph Catholic Church, established 1881, was a product of the early Spanish missions. De Goeijen sold a $3,000,000 stock issue for Stilwell&#x27;s railroad and he was permitted to name the place after his hometown and birthplace of Zwolle, a riverside city of currently over 130,000 population in the Netherlands.

On July 14, 1896, Teofilo “T.” Laroux, a community leader and descendant of the early families, donated 20 acres to the KCS for a railroad depot and town to be built. Paul M. Potts, a prominent cotton farmer donated an additional 22.05 acres on October 15, 1896. The Zwolle townsite was developed by the Arkansas Townsite Company and the official town charter was granted June 12, 1898. The original Kansas City Southern Depot, Zwolle opened October 26, 1896, and served until the present depot was reconstructed in about 1914 by the KCS.

The advent of the railroad brought new prosperity to the town and altered its destiny. Zwolle&#x27;s strategic location made it possible for the small town to flourish as a transportation center for lumber, oil and cotton production. Though no longer a functioning railroad depot, it remains significant to the history and posterity of the town. On December 23, 1970, the depot was donated to the town of Zwolle by the KCS. The depot was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior on August 7, 1989.

The Zwolle Tamale Fiesta is the town&#x27;s signature festival. The festival was founded in 1975 at the suggestion of Sabine Parish Tourist Commission member and Zwolle native Rogers P. Loupe. The fiesta celebrates the Native American and Spanish heritage and cultural influence rooted in the town&#x27;s origins. The fiesta takes its name from the tamale and alludes to the town&#x27;s local notoriety for what is arguably a spicier version of the Mississippi Delta-style boiled tamale, which is believed to have been made in the area since the early 1700s.

The festival is traditionally held on the 2nd weekend of October, kicking off on Thursday night and concluding on Sunday. Originally, the Zwolle High School campus hosted the festival. In the early 2000&#x27;s, the town completed construction of the Zwolle Festival Grounds, after which The Fiesta relocated to the grounds and scaled back to conclude on Saturday night. Attractions include live music, cultural exhibitions, a parade, a ball, a small-scale carnival, a car show and a mud bog competition. 

===Loggers and Forestry Festival===
Founded in 1995, the Loggers and Forestry Festival pays tribute to workers in the community&#x27;s horticulture industry – the cornerstone of the local economy. Each year, A festival queen is decided by a pageant, and the oldest-living logger residing in the town is named the king.

The Loggers and Forestry festival is held at the Zwolle Festival Grounds and mirrors the Tamale Fiesta, including several of its signature events like the parade and mud bog. The festival is held between late April and early May. It is the town&#x27;s second-largest local event.

<text>Arabi () is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, United States. It lies on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River, between the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans and Chalmette within the Greater New Orleans metropolitan area. The population was 4,533 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Arabi was established in the 19th century as a suburb of New Orleans, along the east bank of the Mississippi River. Arabi was part of Orleans Parish; however, a law passed in the 1880s stated that slaughterhouses could not be located within the City of New Orleans. An 1851 map calls the area Jacksonburgh, a name believe to be derived from Andrew Jackson. It is speculated by the publication that the town is named after Arabi Pasha (a mis-transliteration of his actual name Ahmed &#x27;Urabi) who burned Alexandria, Egypt in 1882 while engaged in a revolt against the British administration in Egypt.

Arabi began as the community known as Stockyard Landing, because of the many stockyards and slaughterhouses located there. In the rear yards of some of houses in Old Arabi, there are remnants of blood traps from the area. When excavation for swimming pools was done, residents found dishes from New Orleans hotels and restaurants whose table scraps were once used to feed animals.

Business interests of the stockyards wanted to be free from control of New Orleans and persuaded the state of Louisiana to transfer dominion of the area downriver from Jackson Barracks to St. Bernard Parish in 1875.

===Toponymy===
The area was apparently named after the residents of the area who burned the courthouse down in the 1890s, according to an account published by the FWP in 1941, &quot;reputedly because the incendiary activities of an Arabian sheik were at that time much in the news.&quot; The New York Times makes mention of the media frenzy in 1882 with a note that &quot;The New Orleans &quot;Picayune&quot; has discovered that Arabi Pasha once sold confectionery in that city. But the &quot;Picayune&quot; has a habit of occasionally discovering things that are not so.&quot;

It is speculated by the publication that the town is named after Arabi Pasha (a mis-transliteration of his actual name Ahmed &#x27;Urabi) who torched Alexandria, Egypt in 1882 while engaged in a revolt against the British administration in Egypt. The community felt that the revolt he was leading was a kindred spirit to their own revolt from New Orleans.

===Gambling era (1907–1952)===
In 1907, Friscoville Avenue was developed in Arabi. Because of a ban on gambling in the city limits of Orleans Parish, the area gambling center with approximately five gambling halls was located along the 100 block of Friscoville Avenue. Being just outside the Orleans Parish line, Friscoville was at the time easily accessible by the Canal Street Car Line.

The clubs were frequently raided by the authorities. One such raid was noted by the Associated Press in 1928, under governor Huey P. Long. Upon learning of the re-opening of two clubs in Arabi, he delivered the request to have the clubs raided by the National Guard in person:

Names of 225 persons found in the two places, the Jai-Alai Fronton and the Arabi Club, located just outside the New Orleans city limits, were taken for future reference. The patrons, many of whom were women, were released after being questioned.
Neil Simmes, staff photographer for the Time Picayune, was attacked and beaten by about fifty men as he attempted to take a picture. Guardsmen rescued him. He was unconscious when found. Three officers and five men went to the Jai-Alai Club and two officers and five men to the Arabi Club. The establishments face each other on the same street.
Heavily armed, the soldiers entered the clubs, women screamed and several fainted. A shot rang out, believed to have been fired by a sentry on guard to warn the gamblers of what was taking place. There was a quick grab for money on the gaming tables. Order was restored in a few moments.
In a bonfire this afternoon the gambling paraphernalia that was flammable was burned. The remainder was hacked to bits with axes...

These establishments continued to operate until 1952, when they were shut down as part of a statewide crackdown on illegal gambling after the appointment of United States Army Colonel Francis Grevemberg as superintendent of the Louisiana State Police.

===Historic areas===
The &quot;St. Bernard Voice&quot;, a local paper, began publishing in the late 19th century, and still is produced from a small building on Mehle Street, near the Mississippi river in what was the original settlement.

Most of the area was declared a historic district in the 1970s, including the original St. Bernard Jail, and the remains of the LeBeau Plantation (destroyed by arson November 22, 2013).

===Hurricane Betsy===
Hurricane Betsy swept over the New Orleans area on the evening of September 9, 1965. Betsy caused a strong storm surge in the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a deep-water shipping channel to the east and south of New Orleans. Arabi and Chalmette are in St. Bernard Parish east and below New Orleans on the east bank of the Mississippi River. All of St. Bernard parish is sandwiched between the MRGO and the Mississippi River.

The storm surge over topped levees along the channel and on both sides of its terminus at the Industrial Canal in the Ninth Ward. There may have also been a breach of the Back Protection levee along Florida Avenue. The flooding covered areas of Gentilly and both the upper and lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans. The flooding spread to the east and inundated most of Arabi (except for areas of high ground near the river.) In Arabi, Betsy began to die down around 3am. Many residents, thinking the worst had passed, went to sleep around this time. The flooding reached Arabi Park around 4am waking the exhausted survivors to another phase of the disaster. Between 4am and 6am, the water rose between six and eight feet. By dawn, the water was making its way across the railroad grade between Arabi Park and Carolyn Park and flowing into Chalmette.

For days the survivors huddled in a few two-story buildings surrounded by water, with little or no supplies, power, running water or communications. There was no search and rescue or military presence. Eventually, they evacuated themselves by using their own fishing boats. They headed for higher ground which meant St. Claude Avenue (closer to the Mississippi River) in Arabi and the Kaiser Aluminum plant in Chalmette.

===Hurricane Katrina===
On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused an even more massive storm surge which inundated all of Arabi, with water reaching higher than in some areas.

Much as occurred in Hurricane Betsy, locals who had elected to remain had noticed the winds had begun dying, this time shortly after dawn. Several stories have been noted of locals talking on cell phones with evacuated relatives as late as 8:30-9:00 a.m. CDT, stating they felt the worst was over. The first wave of water struck shortly after 9:00 a.m. and quickly surged all the way to the levee of the Mississippi River. Areas that had suffered less than 3–4 feet of water after Betsy were submerged as much as .

In the Arabi Park area, the surge crossed over elevated railroad tracks and the resultant wave washed many homes off of their foundations, and completely destroyed others. Again, as in Hurricane Betsy the locals immediately began evacuating themselves and their neighbors using private boats. They brought them to the Mississippi river levee, which for several days was the only dry ground on the east side of the river for many miles. Local officials including U.S. Wildlife and Fisheries agents stationed in the parish moved quickly to seal off the area and supply food and water to the survivors. A makeshift evacuation was begun by confiscating small ferry boats, and moving the people to the west bank of the river at Algiers Point, where buses were used to move them out of the area. Most of this activity was not covered by the media due to the greater coverage of nearby New Orleans.

===2022 tornadoes===

==== March ====
On March 22, 2022, an intense EF3 tornado struck Arabi just after 7:30 p.m. CDT, resulting in widespread damage along Friscoville Avenue, St. Bernard Highway, and Judge Perez Drive. Numerous homes were severely damaged or destroyed, cars were tossed, and many trees and power poles were snapped. Arabi Elementary School was damaged as well, and a brewery and a church were also destroyed. The tornado had originated near Gretna before passing through Arabi and continuing to New Orleans East. One person was killed, and several others were injured. Large metal transmission towers sustained major damage, and Arabi was left without power for days after the tornado.

==== December ====
On December 14, 2022, just nine months after the EF3 tornado struck the area, a strong EF2 tornado struck Arabi at around 4:00 p.m. CDT, again causing severe damage to the area. Homes in Arabi sustained significant structural damage, trees and power lines were downed, and the same brewery that was destroyed in the March tornado was destroyed once again. No fatalities occurred, though six people were injured.

==Geography==
Arabi is located at (29.957554, -89.998994).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Chalmette ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in, and the parish seat of, St. Bernard Parish in southeastern Louisiana, United States. The 2010 census reported that Chalmette had 16,751 people; 2011 population was listed as 17,119; however, the pre-Katrina population was 32,069 at the 2000 census. At the 2020 U.S. census, its population rebounded to 21,562. Chalmette is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area. Chalmette is located east of downtown New Orleans and south of Arabi, towards Lake Borgne.

The community was named for plantation owner Louis-Xavier Martin de Lino de Chalmette. Chalmette was appended to the family name after acquiring their Louisiana plantation, in honour of Louis-Xavier Martin de Lino&#x27;s paternal great-grandmother, Antoinette Chalmette (died 1711) &quot;Chalmette,&quot; in French, means pasture, or fallow land, (and traces to the Proto-Celtic word &quot;kalm&quot;).

==History==
Chalmette was founded by plantation owner Louis-Xavier Martin de Lino de Chalmette (1720–1755), a native of Quebec and grandson of René-Louis Chartier de Lotbinière of Maison Lotbinière. His eldest son, Louis Xavier Martin de Lino de Chalmette (1753–1814) was born there and married the sister of Antoine Philippe de Marigny, grandfather of Bernard de Marigny. 

In January 1815, the Battle of New Orleans was fought at the Chalmette plantation, then owned by his second son, Ignace Martin de Lino de Chalmette (1755–1815), a maternal half-brother of Col. Pierre Denis de La Ronde (founder of Versailles, Louisiana), who commanded the Louisiana militia&#x27;s Third Regiment during the battle. The American forces under Major General Andrew Jackson defeated the British forces (led by brevet Lieutenant General Sir Edward Pakenham). On Andrew Jackson&#x27;s orders, the Chalmette plantation was completely destroyed during the battle to prevent the British from using it for cover.
The battlefield is preserved as a national monument complete with visitor center, and the Chalmette National Cemetery is adjacent. Since the mid-1970s, the site has been part of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, a multi-site National Park Service property with its headquarters located in the French Quarter of New Orleans.

The Greek Revival-style plantation house next to the Chalmette battlefield, named the Malus-Beauregard House, was built in 1830 and is open to the public.

From 1951 to 1983, Chalmette was the location of a major Kaiser Aluminum plant.

===Hurricane Katrina===
On August 29, 2005, a storm surge from Hurricane Katrina overflowed through the Mississippi River–Gulf Outlet Canal (commonly known as MRGO) — a commercial channel dug by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the 1960s — and flooded most of the town, with waters as high as 14 to 15 feet (4.9 m) in some places. As a result, Chalmette was extensively swamped and destroyed. A majority of the population evacuated shortly before the storm hit, but there was still significant loss of life.

As of October 25, 2005, most of the buildings were deemed unsalvageable. Despite findings published by the U.S. EPA, the toxic chemicals in the water from local oil refineries have been postulated to be an ongoing health hazard by several civilian ecological groups. Especially notable was the large oil spill originating in Chalmette&#x27;s Murphy Oil facility, where the storm surge knocked over a huge oil tank (&quot;see photo below&quot;).

 headquarters served as the site for a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) trailer park for numerous civil servants who were laboring in the rebuilding effort. A year later, parish employees were still working shifts around the clock to bring the community back to life.

Another center in the rebuilding effort was centered at the church of Our Lady of Prompt Succor, which served the congregations of the seven other Roman Catholic parishes as well as the main office of Catholic Relief Services. It also served as the only place to hold funerals for the first 12 months after Katrina.

Deputies working for the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff stated in early December 2005 that the oil tank floated in the flood. When the water receded, the tank settled on uneven ground. Its structural integrity was compromised, and then the oil spill occurred. By late November, the Murphy facility was functional, as was a small cluster of businesses around the intersection of Paris Road and St. Bernard Highway, on the least damaged River side of Chalmette. The devastated residential areas farther away from the River were open during daylight hours, for residents to salvage belongings from their damaged homes. The majority of people staying in Chalmette full-time were living in trailers, which began to be supplied by FEMA or private enterprises on October 12; although many who had been promised FEMA trailer housing were still waiting as late as March 2006, seven months after the hurricane.

&quot;Camp Premier,&quot; renamed &quot;Camp Hope,&quot; was established as a base camp for the community&#x27;s rebuilding efforts, facilitating the work of relief organizations, the National Guard, and private individuals. As of August 2007, the camp is located at P.G.T. Beauregard Middle School and operated by Habitat for Humanity, to provide for relief volunteers in St. Bernard Parish. Other organizations, such as the St. Bernard Project, have also participated in the rebuilding of Chalmette, from distributing supplies, to clearing debris, to repairing damaged houses.

The Chalmette Battlefield was also partially flooded in low-lying areas, destroying the visitor center, which has since been rebuilt.

===Gradual recovery===
St. Bernard Parish has celebrated Mardi Gras with parades in Chalmette. In February 2006, the krewe of the &quot;Knights of Nemesis&quot; held a parade, past many buildings still in ruins, along the streets of Chalmette.

As of early 2008, many businesses have returned to the area, schools have reopened, although the population remains significantly below pre-Katrina levels.

Due to Hurricane Katrina, the St. Bernard Parish School Board succeeded in getting a school open despite considerable difficulties, including telling FEMA that it would not wait for the agency. The parish opened the St. Bernard Unified School as a K-12 school in late 2005.

With the opening of the 2006–2007 school year, the Unified school reverted to Chalmette High School and now houses grades 9-12. The former Andrew Jackson High School has been repaired and now houses grades 6–8. Trist Middle School houses grades 6 through 8.

The Catholic and private school sector was lost to Katrina. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has consolidated all local schools into one, on the Our Lady of Prompt Succor campus. It has grades PK-8.

==Geography==
Chalmette is located at (29.945504, -89.961602), along the Mississippi River and has an elevation of . It is located east of New Orleans, and is part of the Greater New Orleans area. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land, and (7.56%) is water.

==Demographics==

Poydras was first settled in the 18th century by Isleños when Louisiana was a Spanish colony. Presumably, the town is named for Julien Poydras.

Albert Estopinal, Jr., a St. Bernard Parish district attorney, judge, and sheriff, was born in Poydras in 1869 to later U.S. Representative, Albert Estopinal, Sr.

The locally constructed levee failed during the 1922 flood and the community of Poydras was destroyed. Some historians claim that the levee break was intentional to save the City of New Orleans. The New Orleans river stage dropped .2 foot within 24 hours of the Poydras crevasse and a sound levee had been inspected and reported only 30 minutes before the breach occurred.

Poydras was severely damaged by the impact of Hurricane Katrina on 29 August 2005.

Violet is located on the east bank of the Mississippi River, approximately southeast of New Orleans and is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The area now known as Violet was originally part of the Livaudais Plantation. Violet sprang up after the development of the Violet Canal. It was named by canal booster Albert Covington Janin, after his wife Violet Blair Janin, a Washington, D.C. socialite and part of the influential Blair family for whom the Blair House across from the White House in Washington D.C. is named. Albert Janin spent his youth in St. Bernard Parish in the large Janin family home. His father, Louis Janin, Sr., a prominent lawyer who had immigrated from France to New Orleans in 1828, sent his sons to Europe for their education, including Albert. Albert was a partner with his father&#x27;s law firm, including the office in Washington, D. C., where he remained after marrying into the Blair family. His and Violet&#x27;s life together is told in Virginia Jean Laas&#x27;s book, &quot;Love and Power in the Nineteenth Century, the Marriage of Violet Blair&quot;.

<doc id="115735" wikidata="Q2228038" url="?curid=115735" title="Norco, Louisiana">
<text>Norco is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 2,984 at the 2020 census. The community is home to a major Shell/Valero manufacturing complex. The CDP&#x27;s name is derived from the New Orleans Refining Company.

== Etymology ==
The community of Norco was once called &quot;Sellers,&quot; after a wealthy family there. In 1911, the land was purchased by an agent for Shell Oil, and the New Orleans Refining Company (NORCO) was established. The community&#x27;s name was officially changed from Sellers to Norco sometime after 1926.

==History==
By the late 18th century, French and European colonial settlers had established numerous sugar cane plantations. They imported enslaved Africans as laborers. As sugar cane cultivation was highly labor-intensive, the slave population greatly outnumbered the ethnic Europeans in the colony, a circumstance that continued after the Louisiana Purchase by the United States in 1803.

On January 8, 1811, planters were alarmed by the German Coast Uprising led by Charles Deslondes, a free person of color from Haiti (formerly the French colony of Saint-Domingue). It was the largest slave uprising in US history, though it resulted in few white fatalities. Deslondes and his followers had been influenced by the ideas of the French and Haitian revolutions. In 1809–1810, French-speaking refugees from the Revolution immigrated by the thousands to New Orleans and Louisiana: white planters and their slaves, and free people of color, adding to the French Creole, African and free people of color populations.

Deslondes led followers to the plantation of Col. Manuel André, where they had hoped to seize stored arms, but those had been moved. The band traveled downriver, gathering more slaves for the insurrection as they marched. They were armed simply with hand tools and accompanied their progress by drums. More than 200 men participated in the uprising; they killed two white men on their march toward New Orleans. The alarm was raised, and both militia and regular troops were called out by Gov. William C.C. Claiborne to put down the short-lived revolt. The white militia and troops killed 95 slaves in total, many immediately and others in executions after quick trials.

Since 1995 members of the African American History Alliance of Louisiana have gathered annually at Norco in January to commemorate the events of the German Coast Uprising, when men of color reached for freedom decades before the American Civil War and emancipation. They have been joined by descendants of the insurgents.

In 1942, a Catholic Church, Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, was founded.
In 2021, Hurricane Ida passed through the area, leaving the oil refineries/chemical plants spewing toxic chemicals through flaring.

==Geography==
Norco is located at (30.003753, -90.410824). The city is situated on the eastern edge of the large Bonnet Carré Spillway, which provides for an outlet from the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain during flooding of the river.

Population was 700 when the first post office opened in 1905, and it remained in operation until 1967. By 1977, only 36 people lived in Taft.

In December, 1982, a major explosion occurred at the Union Carbide facility about 30 miles from New Orleans, causing nearly 17,000 people to evacuate.

In probability theory and statistics, the zeta distribution is a discrete probability distribution. If &quot;X&quot; is a zeta-distributed random variable with parameter &quot;s&quot;, then the probability that &quot;X&quot; takes the positive integer value &quot;k&quot; is given by the probability mass function

:formula_7

where &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is the Riemann zeta function (which is undefined for &quot;s&quot; = 1).

The multiplicities of distinct prime factors of &quot;X&quot; are independent random variables.

The Riemann zeta function being the sum of all terms formula_8 for positive integer &quot;k&quot;, it appears thus as the normalization of the Zipf distribution. The terms &quot;Zipf distribution&quot; and the &quot;zeta distribution&quot; are often used interchangeably. But while the Zeta distribution is a probability distribution by itself, it is not associated to the Zipf&#x27;s law with same exponent. 

== Definition ==
The Zeta distribution is defined for positive integers formula_9, and its probability mass function is given by
: formula_10
where formula_11 is the parameter, and formula_12 is the Riemann zeta function.

The cumulative distribution function is given by
: formula_13
where formula_14 is the generalized harmonic number
: formula_15

== Moments ==

The &quot;n&quot;th raw moment is defined as the expected value of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;:

:formula_16

The series on the right is just a series representation of the Riemann zeta function, but it only converges for values of formula_17 that are greater than unity. Thus:

:formula_18

The ratio of the zeta functions is well-defined, even for &quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;s&quot; − 1 because the series representation of the zeta function can be analytically continued. This does not change the fact that the moments are specified by the series itself, and are therefore undefined for large &quot;n&quot;.

=== Moment generating function ===

The moment generating function is defined as

:formula_19

The series is just the definition of the polylogarithm, valid for formula_20 so that

:formula_21 

Since this does not converge on an open interval containing formula_22, the moment generating function does not exist.

==The case &quot;s&quot; = 1==

&quot;ζ&quot;(1) is infinite as the harmonic series, and so the case when &quot;s&quot; = 1 is not meaningful. However, if &quot;A&quot; is any set of positive integers that has a density, i.e. if

:formula_23

exists where &quot;N&quot;(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) is the number of members of &quot;A&quot; less than or equal to &quot;n&quot;, then

:formula_24

is equal to that density.

The latter limit can also exist in some cases in which &quot;A&quot; does not have a density. For example, if &quot;A&quot; is the set of all positive integers whose first digit is &quot;d&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; has no density, but nonetheless the second limit given above exists and is proportional to

:formula_25

which is Benford&#x27;s law.

==Infinite divisibility==

The Zeta distribution can be constructed with a sequence of independent random variables with a geometric distribution. Let formula_26 be a prime number and formula_27 be a random variable with a geometric distribution of parameter formula_28, namely

formula_29

If the random variables formula_30 are independent, then, the random variable formula_31 defined by

formula_32

has the zeta distribution: formula_33.

Stated differently, the random variable formula_34 is infinitely divisible with Lévy measure given by the following sum of Dirac masses:

formula_35

<text>Edgard is a census-designated place (CDP) in, and the parish seat of, St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 2,637 at the 2000 census and 1,948 in 2020. It is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner Metropolitan Statistical Area. Edgard is part of the German Coast of Louisiana.

== History ==
One of the parish&#x27;s first communities and a social haunt of the privateer Jean Lafitte, Edgard has been the parish seat since 1848. Originally named St. John the Baptist for the Catholic church at its heart, Edgard was renamed in 1850 for its postmaster, Edgar Perret. Edgard&#x27;s first St. John the Baptist Catholic Church (1772) was destroyed by the Poché Crévasse in 1821. Another church was soon erected. In 1918 fire gutted the building. Parishioners gave generously to replace the church and, by the time the new church opened its doors, all debts had been paid.

The economic history of Edgard included a sawmill operated by Severin Tassin, a brick factory begun in 1878, and numerous sugar plantations that operated in the century between 1794 and 1894. By 1899, more than fifty family-owned sugar houses (sugar mills) were still operating.

The majority of the town&#x27;s folk worked in the sugar houses, in the fields, or in support of the sugar industry. Many families leased land from the Caires and Graugnards on Columbia Plantation, cultivating their own produce to sell. In 1899, the Mississippi River presented excitement when in the late winter, ice could be seen floating downstream. The ice flows jammed the river, interrupting ship traffic for several days.

In early Edgard, a favorite event of many townspeople was the arrival of the showboat, which would dock at Caire&#x27;s Landing. They never knew when the next boat would arrive. When it did and sounded its calliope, the instrument could be heard as far away as Wallace. Modern vessels still pass by on the river.

Louisiana Supreme Court-appointed &quot;ad hoc&quot; judge Anne Lennan Simon ruled on July 15, 2008, that the areas zoned as designated industrial areas included the facilities of Marathon Petroleum Company, Nalco Co., Gramercy Alumina LLC, Cargill Inc., and Evonik-Stockhausen Inc., thus reducing the city&#x27;s proposed income from &quot;about $144 million to about $28 million.&quot;

==Education==
St. John the Baptist Parish School Board, which includes the entire parish, operates public schools in the community.

Areas in Garyville are zoned to:
*Garyville-Mt. Airy Math and Science Magnet School
*East St. John High School

<text>LaPlace ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. John the Baptist Parish, Louisiana, United States, situated along the east bank of the Mississippi River, in the New Orleans metropolitan area. In 2020, it had a population of 28,841.

LaPlace is the southern terminus of Interstate 55, where it joins with Interstate 10, and of US 51, where it terminates at the junction with US 61. LaPlace is located west of New Orleans.

== History ==
===Pre-European===
The Chitimacha lived in the region prior to the arrival of European colonists. The tribe’s lands once encompassed the entire Atchafalaya Basin, westward to Lafayette, southward to the Gulf of Mexico and eastward to the New Orleans area. The Chitimacha tribe currently resides on a reservation in St. Mary Parish.

=== European colonization ===

Present-day LaPlace was settled by German immigrants in the early 18th century during Louisiana&#x27;s French colonial period, as part of a larger settlement on the bank of the Mississippi called Karlstein. Karlstein was one of the four settlements collectively known as the &quot;German Coast&quot; (), having been populated by German-speaking immigrants since 1721. French and Acadians intermarried with the Germans, and the area came to be known as Bonnet Carré (French for &quot;square bonnet&quot;). The name Bonnet Carré was inspired by the right-angle turn of the Mississippi river near the settlement and its resemblance to a square bonnet.

===1811 Slave Revolt===
Manual Andry built Woodland plantation in 1793 and forced enslaved people to cultivate sugarcane there. The amount of money he stole from their forced labor was sizable. Severe violence was inflicted on the enslaved people, as had been common in Haiti (and had led to a successful slave rebellion there). 

In early January 1811, slaves at Woodland Plantation and several nearby plantations attempted the German Coast Uprising. A group of 200-500 slaves armed with guns, axes, and cane knives set out from LaPlace to conquer New Orleans and gain freedom for themselves and others. Local white &quot;militia&quot; men crushed the rebellion within three days, and nearly 100 slaves were either killed in battle, slaughtered by pursuing militia, or executed after summary trials by planter tribunals. Although more slaves may have participated in the Black Seminole rebellion in 1836 and the whole of the Second Seminole War, this is now considered the largest slave rebellion.

===Post-Civil War developments===
In 1879, pharmacist, planter, and patent medicine purveyor Basile Laplace arrived from New Orleans and established a large plantation in Bonnet Carré. In 1883, he allowed the New Orleans and Baton Rouge Railroad to cut through his land. The settlement&#x27;s railroad depot was named after Laplace, then the post office, and eventually the town itself.

In the 1920s, Woodland Plantation was bought by the Montegut family, but the most famous person born there may have been Kid Ory, who was born in an outbuilding and later led a successful New Orleans jazz band.

=== Weather events ===

In the period between 1850 and 1883, the levee on the east bank of the Mississippi flooded several times. In 1850, a flood created the Bonnet Carré Crevasse, a levee breach that was more than a mile wide. Several major floods were exacerbated by this crevasse near LaPlace, and one resulted in severe flooding of New Orleans in 1871. The breach was closed in 1883.

In 1983, a violent F4 tornado devastated part of the town.

In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew spawned an F3 tornado that killed 2 people.

In 2012, about 5,000 houses were damaged by flooding in LaPlace during Hurricane Isaac.

In February 2016 and again in March 2016, several tornadoes touched down in LaPlace, damaging hundreds of buildings and disrupting power.

LaPlace was badly damaged by Hurricane Ida on August 29, 2021.

===Spelling===
Despite the spelling used for LaPlace&#x27;s namesake, the St. John the Baptist Parish Police Jury decreed in 1971 that the official spelling of the town includes a capital letter &quot;P&quot;.

=== Andouille ===

Andouille, a smoked pork sausage that originated in France, is popular in LaPlace and elsewhere in Louisiana, but in the 1970s, then-Governor Edwin Edwards proclaimed LaPlace the &quot;Official Andouille Capital of the World&quot;. Since 1972, LaPlace has held an Andouille Festival every October. On his program &quot;Feasting on Asphalt&quot;, TV chef Alton Brown visited LaPlace to sample its andouille.

==Industry ==

==Origins==
Cankton, a small bedroom community located at the southern tip of St Landry Parish, was incorporated in 1960.  It received its name from a prominent citizen here by the name of Dr. Lois Aristide Guidry, known to all as &quot;Dr. Cank&quot;. It seems when he was just a boy, there were ducks and other game in the woods surrounding the property he grew up on. He loved to hunt ducks and would signify his return from a hunt by using the duck call which made the nasal sound of . When the old folks heard the call, they would say &quot;&quot; (Cank is back) He kept the name all through childhood and apparently into adulthood as well.

When he finished high school, he went on to medical school. After receiving his degree in medicine from Tulane, he think of no better place to practice medicine than his beloved little community of &quot;Coulee Croche&quot; as it was known then.  His first office was on Guidry Street. As the practice grew, he built a bigger office, which still stands today, on Main Street, next door to his home, which he shared with his wife, Cecile. Dr &quot;Cank&quot; died in July 1951 at the age of 69.

In early 1960, incorporation procedures were started and was finalized in October 1960. The community to be incorporated consisted of an elementary school, a Catholic church, a grocery store, and several homes. When looking for a name, none seemed more suitable than that of their beloved Dr. &quot;Cank&quot;, who was always proud of his community. Freddie Miller was appointed the first mayor with George Elmo Broussard, and Jerome Guidry as the first board of alderman. In 1961, the first elections were held and Wilhelmina Savoie was elected the first mayor of Cankton as well as the first female mayor in St. Landry Parish.

The first known land grant by the colonial Louisiana government was in 1776 in the area referred to as &quot;Buzzard Prairie&quot;.

The thriving community had two bakeries, a cobbler, a millinery, a blacksmith shop, a post office, six bars, and nine brothels.

In 1821, Mrs. Charles Smith, widow of a wealthy planter in Opelousas, donated land, a two-story building, and funds to pay for the travel expenses of two nuns from St. Charles, Missouri. The two nuns of the Religious of the Sacred Heart founded a convent and a school that became the Academy of the Sacred Heart.

The Jesuits arrived in 1837 when St. Charles College was built. The settlement that grew up around the schools was called St. Charles Town before it was changed to Grand Coteau. Grand Coteau is derived from the French meaning &quot;great hill.&quot;

On October 3, 1863, the Campaign of the Teche was commenced. The Ninety-ninth infantry regiment of Illinois was in several skirmishes, and a detachment of the regiment, Captain A. C. Mathews commanding, was engaged in the Battle of Grand Coteau. On November 9, they moved on to New Orleans. Although thousands of Union troops were encamped in the fields surrounding the Academy during the Civil War, the school was not touched.

In the 19th century the population of Grand Coteau grew with African-Americans, free people of color, Acadians, Creoles, French, Irish, and German immigrants. The town retains examples of Victorian architecture from its mid-19th-century boom.

<doc id="115753" wikidata="Q430778" url="?curid=115753" title="Krotz Springs, Louisiana">
<text>Krotz Springs is a town in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, United States, on the Atchafalaya River. The population was 1,198 at the 2010 census, down from 1,219 in 2000. It is part of the Opelousas–Eunice Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Around the turn of the 20th century, an Ohio native, Charles William Krotz, bought of woodland around the Atchafalaya Basin and set up a sawmill to trim the trees hauled out of the basin. The tiny settlement that grew up around the mill was called Latania (&quot;fan palm&quot;), after the bayou of the same name and the types of palm plants found in the area.

Thinking he was sitting on an untapped pool of oil, Krotz attempted to drill the first oil well in St. Landry Parish in 1900, but he struck water instead of oil, the result becoming known as Krotz’s spring. The spring was used to supply water for the developing sawmill town, and Krotz even bottled the water, selling it throughout the country.

In 1909, a post office was established in the town, and the obvious choice of a name was Krotz Springs.

The Krotz Springs Bridge spanning the Atchafalaya River opened in 1928 and carried railroad and automobile traffic. It was superseded by other bridges at the same location in 1934, 1973, and 1988.
==Mayors==
Robert A. Moran, a Democrat served as mayor from 1986 until his death in May 1987. On November 21, 1987, James Rasie Nall defeated Ina Moran (D) in a runoff election for mayor. Four years later, on October 6, 1990, Gary Soileau (D) defeated Larry Martinez, Sr. (D), in a landslide victory with 86 percent of the ballots cast. Soileau would remain mayor until he retired in 2010, when he was succeeded by current mayor Carroll Snyder, another Krotz Springs Democrat.

<text>Opelousas (; ) is a small city and the parish seat of St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, United States. Interstate 49 and U.S. Route 190 were constructed with a junction here. According to the 2020 census, Opelousas has a population of 15,786, a 6.53 percent decline since the 2010 census, which had recorded a population of 16,634. Opelousas is the principal city for the Opelousas-Eunice Micropolitan Statistical Area, which had an estimated population of 80,808 in 2020. Opelousas is also the fourth largest city in the Lafayette-Acadiana Combined Statistical Area, which has a population of 537,947.

Historically an area of settlement by French and Spanish Creoles, Creoles of color, and Acadians, Opelousas is the center of zydeco music. It celebrates its heritage at the Creoles of Color Heritage Folklife Center, one of the destinations on the new Louisiana African-American Heritage Trail. It is also the location of the Evangeline Downs Racetrack and Casino.

The city calls itself &quot;the spice capital of the world&quot;, with production and sale of seasonings such as Tony Chachere&#x27;s products, Targil Seasonings, Savoie&#x27;s cajun meats and products, and LouAna Cooking Oil.

During the tenure of Sheriff Cat Doucet, from 1936 to 1940 and again from 1952 to 1968, the section of Opelousas along Highway 190 was a haven of gambling and prostitution, the profits from which he skimmed a take.

==History==
===Early years===

Opelousas takes its name from the Native American tribe Opelousa who had occupied the area before European contact.

French traders, called &quot;coureurs de bois&quot; (forest trappers and hunters), arrived in the Opelousas area in the early 1740s to trade with the Opelousas Indians. The French encouraged immigration to the Opelousas Post before they ceded Louisiana to Spain in 1762. Governor Jean-Jacques d’Abbadie opened the &quot;Opelousas Country&quot; to settlers in 1763. An official post was established in 1764; Frenchman Louis Gérard Pellerin was appointed as the first commandant on July 1, 1764. By 1766, Saint Landry Catholic Church was built. In 1769, about 100 families, mostly French, were living in the post. &quot;Don&quot; Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly, Spanish governor of Louisiana, issued a land ordinance to allow settlers in the frontier of the Opelousas Territory to acquire land grants. However, O’Reilly forbade Acadians from settling in the Opelousas area until his successor, Luis de Unzaga, nullified that order and allowed Acadians to settle at the Opelousas. The first official land grant was made in 1782. Numerous settlers: French, Spanish, Creoles, and Acadians – mainly from the Attakapas Territory – came to the Opelousas Territory and acquired land grants. By the mid-1780s, land was granted at the site of contemporary Opelousas. (Some people confuse the name of this Indian tribe and territory, Opelousas, with that of the Appaloosa horse. But there is no connection; the name for the Appaloosa breed is derived from &quot;Palouse&quot;, a river named by the Nez Perce Northwestern Plains Indians.)

After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 to France who had regained it in 1800, settlers continued to migrate here from St. Martinville. LeBon, Prejean, Thibodaux, Esprit, Nezat, Hebert, Babineaux, Mouton, and Provost were some of the early Creole families. (This use of &quot;Creole&quot; meant ethnic French and Spanish people who were born in Louisiana. Later Louisiana Creole was a term applied to anyone with French, Spanish, and Canadian ancestry. Creoles of color were mostly assigned to mixed-race people, descended primarily from Native Americans, African-Americans, and ethnic French, with other heritage in more recent years.) Other early French Creole families were Roy, Barre, Guenard, Decuir, and Bail. In 1820, Alex Charles Barre, also a French Creole, founded Port Barre. His ancestors came from the French West Indies, probably after the revolution in which Haiti (St. Domingue) became independent. Jim Bowie and his family were said to have settled in the area &quot;circa&quot; 1813.

In 1805, Opelousas became the seat of the newly formed St. Landry Parish – named after the church located there and in honor of Saint Landry – the parish was also known as the Imperial Parish of Louisiana. The year 1806 marked the beginning of significant construction in Opelousas. The first courthouse was constructed in the middle of the town. Later in 1806, Louisiana Memorial United Methodist Church was founded. It was the first Methodist church in Louisiana. Five years later, the first St. Landry Parish Police Jury met in Opelousas, keeping minutes in the two official languages of English and French. The city was incorporated by legislative act on February 14, 1821. 

===American Civil War===

European and American settlement was based on plantation agriculture, and both groups brought or purchased numerous enslaved Africans and African Americans to work as laborers in cotton cultivation. African Americans influenced all cultures as the people created a &quot;creolized&quot; cuisine and music. The long decline of cotton prices throughout the 19th century created economic problems, worsened by the lack of employment diversity.

In 1862, after Baton Rouge fell to the Union troops during the Civil War, Opelousas was designated the state capital for nine months. The governor&#x27;s mansion in Opelousas, which was the oldest remaining governor&#x27;s mansion in Louisiana, was the victim of arson on July 14, 2016, and the structure was reduced to a chimney and its foundation. The one-story mansion was located on the corner of Liberty and Grolee Streets, just west of the heart of town. An observation tower was removed from the top of the residence in the early 1900s, but the remainder of the exterior was identical to its original construction in the 1850s. The entire roof section of heavy rafters was held in place by thousands of wooden pegs; not one nail could be found in the attic. Plans had been made to restore the building to some of its former splendor. The capital was moved again in 1863, this time to Shreveport, when Union troops occupied Opelousas. During Reconstruction, the state government operated from New Orleans.

===Reconstruction===
After the defeat of the South and emancipation of slaves, many whites had difficulty accepting the changed conditions, especially as economic problems and dependence on agriculture slowed the South&#x27;s recovery. Social tensions were high during Reconstruction. In 1868, in what is known as the Opelousas massacre, whites killed 27 African Americans in a mass execution; they had been captured in a protest. Whites continued to attack blacks on sight for days. An estimated additional 23 to 200–300 freedmen were killed during this period. This series of murders comprised one of the single worst instances of Reconstruction violence in south Louisiana.

Following this, Opelousas in 1872 enacted ordinances that greatly restricted the freedoms of black Americans. These codes required blacks to have a written pass from their employer to enter the town and to state the duration of their visit. Blacks were not allowed on the streets after a 10 pm curfew; they could neither own a house nor reside in the town, unless they were employed by a white person, and they were not allowed in the town after 3 pm on Sundays. Like the Black Codes, such police regulations restricted the freedoms and personal autonomy of freedmen after the Civil War in the South.

===Refugee era and beyond===
In 1880, the railroad reached Opelousas. In the late 19th century, New York City social services agencies arranged for resettlement of Catholic orphan children by sending them to western rural areas, including Opelousas, in Louisiana and other states. At least three Orphan Trains reached this city before 1929. Opelousas is the heart of a traditional Catholic region of French, Spanish, Canadian, and French West Indian ancestry. Catholic families in Louisiana took in more than 2,000 mostly Catholic orphans to live in their rural farming communities.

In the year 1920, segregation at St Landry Catholic Church led local Black Catholics to establish their own parish, Holy Ghost. It has since grown to become the largest Black parish in the United States.

In May 1927, Opelousas accepted thousands of refugees following the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 in the Mississippi Delta. Heavy rains in northern and midwestern areas caused intense flooding in areas of Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana downstream, especially after levées near Moreauville, Cecilia, and Melville collapsed.

More than 81% of St. Landry Parish suffered some flooding, with 77% of the inhabitants directly affected. People in more southern areas of Louisiana, especially those communities along Bayou Teche, were forced to flee their homes for areas that suffered less damage. By May 20, over 5,700 refugees were registered in Opelousas, which had a population of only 6,000 people. Many of the refugees later returned to their homes and began the rebuilding process.

During the tenure of Parish Sheriff Cat Doucet from 1936 to 1940 and 1952 to 1968, the section of Opelousas along Highway 190 was a haven of gambling and prostitution. Doucet told historian Michael Kurtz that, with the return of Earl Long to the governorship in 1956, Doucet could bring back brothels and casinos and get a take of the proceeds.

Since 1982, Opelousas has hosted the Original Southwest Louisiana Zydeco Festival. Usually held the Saturday before Labor Day at Zydeco Park in Plaisance, the festival features a day of performances by Zydeco musicians, with the goal of keeping the genre alive.Additional annual events include:

KOCZ broadcasts music, news, and public affairs to listeners now at 92.9. It was originally on 103.7, but had to move due to a full-power station being licensed to 103.7. Opelousas is home to The Mix KOGM 107.1FM, which is owned by KSLO Broadcasting, Inc.

<doc id="115758" wikidata="Q2181816" url="?curid=115758" title="Port Barre, Louisiana">
<text>Port Barre (BAH-ree) is a town in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, United States. The town began in 1760 as an Indian trading post at the place where Bayou Teche flows out of Bayou Courtableau. The population was 2,055 at the 2010 census, down from 2,287 in 2000. It is part of the Opelousas–Eunice Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Port Barre takes its name from Alex Charles Barre (born 1746, died 1829); it was not incorporated under this name until 1898.

In 1733, the semi-nomadic Opelousas Indians petitioned the French colonial government to send traders to their district. In 1760, a couple of coureurs des bois set up a trading post at a landing where the bayous meet.

In 1765, Jacques Courtableau, a wealthy landowner, gave land grants to 32 Acadian immigrants. That same year, he sold Charles Barre a large parcel of land, including the site of the first trading post. The post later became known as Barre&#x27;s Landing, then Port Barre. It thrived as a port town before the days of the railroads.

Guillaume Barre was born in 1642 in St. Valery, France. He emigrated, settling about 1665 in Martinique in the French West Indies. Guillaume Barre met Jean Roy (1625–1707) and Jean Hebert (1624); they traveled together to Louisiana. The Barres settled in Pointe Coupee, Louisiana, where they met the Nezat family (Pierre Nezat coming from Saint Domingue), and the Provost family (Nicolas Provost coming from Paris via Fort de Chartres, in the Illinois Country).

Alex Charles Barre is a descendant of Guillaume Barre. In 1765 he bought a large parcel of land, including the site of the first trading post, from Jacques Courtableau. Barre married Magdelaine Decuir in Pointe Coupee; they had 11 children together. Three of their children married three members of the Nezat family. Around this same time, three Nezats married three Roys, and the three families became closely entwined.

In 1820, Charles Alex Barre purchased additional acres along the bank of the bayou from Sieur Jacques Guillaume Courtableau. The Barre family operated a goods-handling business. The Barre, Nezat, and Roy families settled in this area and expanded. The settlement continued to grow through the 19th century. On July 13, 1898, the village of Port Barre was officially incorporated by Act of Proclamation of Louisiana Governor Jared Y. Sanders, Sr.

==Geography==
Port Barre is located at the confluence of Bayou Courtableau and Bayou Teche, 8 miles east of Opelousas and 52 miles west of Baton Rouge via U.S. Highway 190.

==History==
Like many towns in Southern Louisiana, Sunset began as a railroad town (for the out-distribution of cotton and sweet potatoes and the in-distribution of specialty goods), was incorporated in 1904, and had its first village meeting that December 7. Victor Hugo Sibille was the first mayor. As part of a large-scale conversion of arable land away from cotton (due to the mass-destruction from the cotton boll weevil) and toward sweet potatoes in the late 19th century, the city gave itself the nickname &quot;Sweet Potato Capital of the Nation&quot; at the turn of the 20th century. According to local lore, The Bank of Sunset was one of the very few that did not close throughout the Great Depression of 1929.

<text>Washington is a village in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 742 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Opelousas–Eunice Micropolitan Statistical Area. Washington was the largest inland port between New Orleans and St. Louis for much of the 19th century.

==History==
Washington was founded in 1720 as a French trading post. In 1774 the first church, &quot;La Iglesia paroquial de la Immaculada Conception del Puesto de Opelousas&quot; was started and the post became known as Church Landing. In 1835 the town was incorporated under the current name. It is the third oldest town in Louisiana.
In the early 1800s smaller steamboats started traveling up Bayou Teche to the Opelousas River, renamed Bayou Courtableau, at Barre’s Landing (named after Alexander Charles Barré) that became Port Barre, then to Washington where there was a bottleneck as the steamboats could not turn around. In 1848 Captain George W. Haygood completed a steamboat turnaround and Washington became an inland port.

The Grimble Bell School was located in Washington and was the first African American school in the parish when it opened in the 1830s; it was forced closed by white vigilantes in 1860.

During the American Civil War, some of Union General Nathaniel P. Banks&#x27; forces occupied several towns in the region, including Washington, which was then larger than the parish seat of Opelousas. Banks&#x27; men stripped the towns of supplies of all kinds, including food, livestock, cotton, and other trade goods; the total value of the goods was estimated at more than ten million dollars.

After the war, there was extensive white resistance to the emancipation and enfranchisement of former slaves or freedmen. Some insurgents based in Opelousas formed the Seymour Knights, a unit of the Knights of the White Camellia. In the fall of 1868 before the election, white Democrats in Washington rejected African Americans who sought to join their political party, and the Seymour Knights physically drove the blacks out of the city.

A series of events followed in which blacks marched on Opelousas and 29 men were captured. All but two were executed without trial, and whites rampaged against blacks in the parish seat and surrounding area, killing an estimated 50 to 200-300 African Americans, in what is known as the Opelousas Massacre.

== Speed trap ==
Washington has a reputation of being a speed trap; that is, a town where traffic laws are enforced extremely strictly as a means of generating revenue. A 2007 report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor found that more than 50% of the town&#x27;s revenue came from traffic-related fines in the 2005 fiscal year. It was one of 15 such towns. In 2009, then-mayor Joseph Pitre told &quot;The Advocate&quot; newspaper that he believed the town had collected between $700,000-$800,000 from speeding tickets yearly.

In 2014, State Representative Alan Seabaugh targeted Washington as the most &quot;notorious&quot; speed trap in the state. He obtained approval of the House Transportation Committee to allow enforcement of traffic laws only if a community had incorporated at least one-half mile of land that extends to each side of an interstate highway, excluding overpasses and ramps. At the time, Seabaugh reported receiving many complaints from constituents in Shreveport as well as out-of-state drivers who have been ticketed for speeding only slightly over the legal limit.

<text>Breaux Bridge (; ; ) is a small city in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 8,139 as of the 2010 census, up from 7,281 in 2000. By 2020, its population was 7,513. It is part of the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area.

Originally dubbed &quot;La Capitale Mondiale de l’Écrevisse&quot;, by its French-speaking residents, Breaux Bridge was officially designated the &quot;Crawfish Capital of the World&quot; by Bob Angelle, then serving as Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives. 

Breaux Bridge hosts an annual Crawfish Festival. It is regionally noted for its practice of listing people by nicknames in the town&#x27;s telephone directory.

==History==
Firmin Breaux was a pioneer from Acadia, who settled here after expulsion by the British in what is now eastern Canada. He is known to have arrived in the area during early 1765 (after the British defeat of the French in 1763). By 1774, his branding iron was registered. By 1786 he was one of the largest property owners in the Bayou Têche country. 

In 1799, Breaux built a footbridge across the Bayou Têche to help his family and neighbors make the passage. This first bridge was a suspension footbridge, likely made of rope and small planks. It was stabilized by being tied to small pilings located at each end of the bridge as well as to a pair of huge live oak trees on both sides of the bayou. When traveling directions were given, residents would often instruct people to &quot;go to Breaux&#x27;s bridge . . .&quot; This was later adopted as the city&#x27;s name.

On August 25, 1829, the widow Scholastique (Picou) Breaux founded Breaux Bridge, Louisiana at the age of 33. She was born Scholastique Melanie Picou on July 25, 1796. At a young age, she had married Agricole Breaux. Together, they had five children. In 1817, the couple replaced the Bayou Têche suspension footbridge built by Agricole&#x27;s father Fermin with a vehicular bridge that allowed wagon passage and made way for the area&#x27;s increasing commerce. At the age of 32, her husband died and Breaux was widowed. 

A determined Acadian woman, Scholastique drew up &quot;Plan de la Ville du Pont des Breaux&quot; (“Plan for the City of Breaux Bridge”), which included a detailed map of the area and a diagram of streets. She developed the area by selling land lots to other Acadian settlers. In 1847, a church parish was created. Twelve years later, the area was officially incorporated. After founding the town, Scholastique remarried. She had two more children with her second husband.

==Battle of Breaux Bridge==
During the American Civil War, Breaux Bridge was the site of an engagement known as the &quot;Battle of Breaux Bridge.&quot; According to Andrew B. Booth’s 1920 &quot;Index to Battles, Campaigns, Engagements, Etc., Fought Within the Limits of the State of Louisiana, 1861–1865,&quot; military actions took place at Breaux Bridge on April 17 and April 21, 1863. Local historical accounts indicate that several soldiers armed with muskets clashed across the bridge—a critical crossing point in the area. Although detailed records of this battle remain limited, its occurrence highlights the strategic importance of the bridge during the war and its enduring role in local history.

<text>Cecilia is a census-designated place (CDP) in St. Martin Parish, in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The community lies within the region of Acadiana, and the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area. It had a population of 1,505 at the 2000 U.S. census, estimated to have grown to 1,917 in 2019 at the American Community Survey&#x27;s 5-year estimates.

==History==
Cecilia sits on land that was historically inhabited by the Atakapa Tribe. The Atakapa lived in what is now Southwest Louisiana and Texas, and had a trading post at St. Martinville, before French settlers took over the land.

Cecilia was originally known by the Spanish as &quot;La Punta.&quot; It was translated by the French into &quot;La Grande Pointe&quot;, a name that was used by many people until contemporary times when it was then called Cecilia, named after the first postal clerk.

Pierre Guidry, the first settler of Cecilia, acquired three tracts of land from Mrs. Joseph Alexander Declouet in 1791. Joseph Angelle settled nearby soon after.

Both men apparently settled on lands that had been given to Declouet by a Spanish land grant dated May 16, 1772, that included some of land.

During the American Civil War, the settlement was also known as &quot;La Place&quot;. This name was dropped when postal authorities began to confuse it with the LaPlace in St. John the Baptist Parish.

Cecilia is the birthplace of several Louisiana political figures: state Representative and House Speaker Robert Joseph &quot;Bob&quot; Angelle (1896–1979), former Secretary of State of Louisiana and Lieutenant Governor Paul J. Hardy (born 1942), and former state Representatives J. Burton Angelle and Jesse J. Guidry, who became secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries; Angelle from 1972 to 1980 and 1984 to 1988 and Guidry from 1981 to 1984. Former National Football League player Ramsey Dardar was also born in Cecilia.

Cecilia is the burial site of Louis Hebert, a Confederate general. On April 19, 1964, dedication ceremonies were held in a grove of live oaks on the banks of Bayou Teche about from Cecilia on Highway 328 to mark Hebert&#x27;s grave. The marker reads as follows: &quot;Approximately to the west is the probable resting place of General Louis Hebert, C. S. A. Born in Iberville Parish in 1820, Hebert graduated from West Point in 1845 third in his class. After an army service of two years, he resigned to manage his family&#x27;s sugar interests. Before the war he was a member of the State Senate and Chief Engineer of Louisiana. He fought at Wilson&#x27;s Creek, Elkhorn, Corinth, Vicksburg, and Port Fisher. He was an editor and teacher in Iberville and St. Martin parishes and lived until 1901.&quot; General Hebert taught at Huron Plantation near Cecilia and tutored children of Vincent Barras in St. Martinville.

Cecilia became one of the last remaining strongholds of the Cajun French language in Louisiana and 42.60% of the total population used the language for daily communication, including 20.25% of the children according to a study in 2013.

<doc id="115764" wikidata="Q590648" url="?curid=115764" title="Parks, Louisiana">
<text>Parks is a village in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 653 at the 2010 census, and 696 at the 2020 population estimates program. It is part of the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

The exact origin of the name &quot;Parks&quot; is somewhat of a mystery. Although some residents seem to think that it had something to do with the railroad, one story states the first train to pass through the community arrived on Easter Sunday. When the train engineer, who apparently did not speak or understand French, inquired about the name of the settlement, the residents replied &quot;C&#x27;est Pacques&quot; (it&#x27;s Easter). The train engineer thought he understood the word Parks, and the name apparently stuck.

Parks, originally called Potier, lies in the area previously known as &quot;La Pointe District&quot;, which existed in 1765. It was also called La Pointe de Repose, supposedly because the cowhands in the early 19th century drove their cattle into the cul-de-sac formed by the sharp bend of the bayou on round up time.

Settlement began in the Parks village shortly after 1900. Around that time, Paul Melancon purchased a large tract of land in the vicinity of what is now Parks in order to establish a cotton farm. But, shortly after buying the property, he decided to divide a portion into town lots and the community took shape. In 1908, the village of 330 acres was incorporated. Since that time, Parks has remained approximately the same size.
