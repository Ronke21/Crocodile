<text>Darnestown is a United States census-designated place (CDP) and an unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland. The CDP is with the Potomac River as its southern border and the Muddy Branch as much of its eastern border. Seneca Creek borders portions of its north and west sides. The Travilah, North Potomac, and Germantown census-designated places are adjacent to it, as is the city of Gaithersburg. Land area for the CDP is . As of the 2020 census, the Darnestown CDP had a population of 6,723, while the village of Darnestown is considerably smaller in size and population. Downtown Washington, D.C. is about to the southeast.

Within the Darnestown census-designated place at the intersection of what is now Darnestown Road and Seneca Road, the small village of Darnestown has existed since about 1800. The community had a population of 200 in 1878. The name Darnestown comes from William Darne, who owned the most land in the area at the beginning of the 19th century when the community post office opened. Settlement in the area began around 1750, and the tiny community was called Mount Pleasant, and then Darnes, before the name Darnestown began being used. The community thrived in the 19th century during the golden years of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, as the improved transportation facilities offered area farmers access to more markets. In the 1880 census, the United States Census Bureau began using a Minor Civil Division (MCD) category for aggregating populations, and the new Darnestown district had about 1,500 people. Growth stopped late in the 19th century when a new railway bypassed the community.

In the 1960s, affluent families began buying Montgomery County farmland for new housing and equestrian purposes. Today, many Darnestown CDP residents are wealthy and live in large homes on large lots, which is reflected in their high average income and low housing density. The median household income is nearly $228,000, and 73 percent of residents aged 25 years or more have at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher. The community benefits from its proximity to workplaces such as the Shady Grove Hospital area and the I-270 Technology Corridor. Washington is accessible by automobile or public transportation. Beginning with the 2000 census, the Census Bureau created a Darnestown census-designated place.

==History==

The first European (mostly Scottish and English) settlements in what would become Montgomery County, Maryland, were established in 1688, near Rock Creek and what was to become Rockville. The next stage of settlements was further west along the Potomac River near what is now Darnestown and Poolesville. The land had been occupied by Native Americans of the Piscataway Confederation. Ninian Beall was the first European landowner in the Darnestown area, settling around 1749. His daughter Ruth Beall married Charles Gassaway, who built a brick home named Pleasant Hills around 1765. This was one of the first brick homes in what is now Montgomery County, and still stands today. Gassaway purchased land from his father-in-law during the late 1700s—including land that would eventually become the Darnestown village. In the last half of the 18th century, a small village grew at the intersection of what is now Darnestown Road (Maryland Route 28) and Seneca Road (Maryland Route 112). At that time, Darnestown Road was called &quot;the road from Georgetown to the mouth of the Monocacy River&quot;. It was a Seneca Indian trail and is one of the oldest roads in Montgomery County. Seneca Road led from Darnestown to the Seneca Mill and a landing on the Potomac River—a trip of less than .
Gassaway&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth married William Darne in 1798. Darne was a civic leader who served in the Maryland House of Delegates, as a judge, and as director of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. He also became one of the area&#x27;s biggest landowners. The community was called Mount Pleasant until the establishment of a post office around 1803, when it gradually began being called &quot;Darnes&quot; in honor of its leading citizen. The Darnes name lasted until the mid–1820s, when the village became known as Darnestown. Darnestown&#x27;s first store was kept by John Candler, and he is also cited as its first postmaster. Leonard W. Candler was the Darnestown postmaster as early as 1828, and he was still listed as such in 1850 when Darnestown was one of 15 post offices in Montgomery County. By the 1820s, the community had a wheelwright, mill, blacksmith, physician, and other businesses.

Originally, Darnestown area land was used by European settlers for growing tobacco and corn. Construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (a.k.a. C&amp;O Canal), which was operating between Georgetown and Seneca by June 1832, provided farmers with better access to markets. A network of roads and mills grew to connect farmers with the canal. Mills in the area included the Seneca Mill (circa 1780), Black Rock Mill (built in 1815), and the DuFief Mill (established 1850). Darne died in 1845, and his farm was eventually given to his son Alexander. By 1860, farmers were growing corn, wheat and oats. At the beginning of the American Civil War, Union Army leadership realized that the Potomac River area near Seneca was a possible crossing point for a Confederate invasion that could include Washington. The Darnestown area was occupied during 1861 by 18,000 Union troops. About halfway between the canal and Darnestown, Major General Nathaniel P. Banks kept his headquarters at the Samuel Thomas Magruder farm where the Potomac River could be observed from high ground. Troops from the 13th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment occupied the Pleasant Hills home originally built by the Gassaways. After the war, Darnestown continued to be a farming community. An 1879 atlas lists 19 of 22 Darnestown &quot;patrons&quot; as farmers.

In the 1870s, Darnestown&#x27;s favorable transportation location suffered two setbacks that would affect future growth. First, freight traffic on the C&amp;O Canal peaked in 1871, starting a downward trend that would end with the canal closing permanently in 1924. Second, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s new Metropolitan Branch opened in 1873 and bypassed Darnestown—running through Rockville, Gaithersburg, and Germantown. These factors limited growth for Darnestown, as nearby communities on the new rail line had &quot;unprecedented facilities&quot; for &quot;personal travel and transportation of productions and supplies&quot;. The Darnestown Post Office, which had been operating for over 100 years, was discontinued May 31, 1911. The region around the Darnestown village did not exceed its 1890 population until after 1940, and the nearby villages of Hunting Hill, Travilah, and Seneca became essentially ghost towns. Darnestown grew very little until the 1960s, when wealthy families began buying farmland for living quarters and horseback riding. From 1970 to 1976, the population along Maryland Route 28 from Rockville to Darnestown nearly tripled.

===Historic places===

The cornerstone for the Darnestown Presbyterian Church was laid on September 14, 1856 by a congregation organized in 1855. John L. DuFief, a community leader and owner of the DuFief Mill, donated of land for the church. The completed structure was dedicated on May 22, 1858. The building was expanded in the late 1890s, and a bell tower was added at that time. Stained glass windows were installed in 1905, and a rear wing was added in the 1950s. The church&#x27;s cemetery contains the graves of some of the area&#x27;s early settlers, including members of the Darne, Clagett, Offutt and Tschiffely families; Chesapeake and Ohio Canal lock keepers Pennifield, Violette, and Riley; and philanthropist Andrew Small. Small&#x27;s donation of $40,000 () became the Andrew Small Academy, and its building was said to be the largest school house in the country at the time of its construction in 1869. The three-story building became a public high school in 1907, and was demolished in 1955 when the present-day Darnestown Elementary School was built.

Additional historic places include Black Rock Mill, located in Seneca Creek State Park. The mill began operating in 1815, was run by Nicholas Offutt (a grandson of Ninian Beall) from 1866 until 1891, and continued operating into the 20th century. The Samuel Thomas Magruder farmhouse, now privately owned, was headquarters for Major General Nathaniel P. Banks in 1861 during the American Civil War. After Magruder and his wife died in the 1880s, the farm became the home of their daughter Mary and husband Wilson B. Tschiffely, who purchased the Seneca Mill in 1902. Further south, Riley&#x27;s Lock and Violette&#x27;s Lock are located along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (a.k.a. C&amp;O Canal), and are now part of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The Pennyfield Lock, also part of the park, is located less than east of Violette&#x27;s Lock—outside of the Darnestown census-designated place and within the Travilah census-designated place. The community of Seneca exists on the edge of the Darnestown census-designated place, on Seneca Creek close to Riley&#x27;s Lock and the Potomac River. With the demise of the C&amp;O Canal, Seneca lost its relevance. Today, a few homes, a schoolhouse, a store, ruins of two mills, and ruins of a quarry are all that remain.

==Geography==

As an unincorporated area, Darnestown&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined. However, in 1878 the U.S. Census Bureau created a new Minor Civil Division (MCD) named Darnestown District (No. 6), that was used to aggregate portions of the county. The new district was created from the eastern portion of the Medley District and the western portion of the Rockville District. The new Darnestown District was out of the county&#x27;s total of , making it fifth of eight districts in size. The Darnestown/District 6 MCD was still used in the 1970 Census, and for Maryland it was shown as a county subdivision. Little Seneca Creek and Great Seneca Creek formed the western border of this district. The Piney Branch and Dufief&#x27;s Mill Road formed the District 6 eastern border. The Clarksburgh District (No. 2), which included Germantown, was on the north side of District 6, with Rockville Road forming the border. The Potomac River from Great Seneca Creek to the Piney Branch formed the southern border. Multiple C&amp;O Canal Locks were included in District 6, and the communities of Seneca, Hunting Hill, and Travilah were part of District 6 in addition to Darnestown.

In the 2000 census, the Census Bureau created a new Census-designated place (CDP) called Darnestown. A Darnestown CDP was also used in the 2010 census. The Darnestown CDP has of land, which is smaller than the old Darnestown MCD. The CDP uses the Muddy Branch, Turkey Foot Road, and Jones Lane for most of its eastern border instead of rivers further east. The MCD territory between Little Seneca Creek and the north side of Great Seneca Creek is also not part of the Darnestown CDP. Great Seneca Creek remains as the western border. Washington, D.C. is roughly away. The Travilah and North Potomac CDPs are along the Darnestown CDP&#x27;s eastern border. The United States Geological Survey lists ten Darnestown-related features, including the Darnestown Census Designated Place with an elevation of and the Darnestown populated place (a.k.a. Darnestown village) has an elevation of .

The region around Seneca uses 20834, which is a Poolesville ZIP code. Examples of ZIP codes in various parts of the Darnestown CDP are 20878 for Darnestown Elementary School, 20874 for the former miller&#x27;s house at Black Rock Mill, and 20834 at Riley&#x27;s Lock.

Forest Glen is also home to the National Park Seminary, a unique and landmark residential community in an old building complex.

==History==
Forest Glen was once part of a land grant made in 1680 to one of Archbishop John Carroll&#x27;s ancestors.

Daniel Carroll, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, lived in Forest Glen. Carroll&#x27;s body was buried in St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church Cemetery in Forest Glen. The church building was originally built as a wood-framed structure in 1774. It was replaced by a brick structure in 1894.

Racial covenants were used in the Woodside Knolls neighborhood of Forest Glen to exclude Black and Jewish residents. A 1939 covenant from Woodside Knolls states: &quot;No part of the land above described shall ever be used or occupied by or sold demised, transferred unto, or in trust for, leased, or rented, or given to negroes, or any person or persons of negro blood extraction, or to any person of the Semitic race, blood or origin, which racial description shall be deemed to include Jews and Hebrews, except that this paragraph shall not be held to exclude partial occupancy of the premises by domestic servants of said races.&quot;

The Forest Estates neighborhood of Forest Glen was developed in the 1940s by Jewish real estate developers. The area was formerly rural. Forest Estates was desirable to white Jewish homeowners moving to the suburbs from the city, because some white Christian neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. used antisemitic and racist covenants in real estate to exclude Jews, as well as African-Americans and other people of color. Antisemitic covenants were not used in Forest Estates, however, some Jewish developers used anti-Black covenants to exclude African-Americans. In 1945, Forest Glen Homes purchased land formerly owned by the Getty family, who had farmed the land since 1883. The houses in Forest Estates began construction in 1947. The Forest Glen Homes real estate company included Leo Minskoff, Sadie Milestone, Philip Milestone, and several others. Other builders in Forest Glen included the Russian immigrant Nathan Brisker and the Italian immigrant Anthony Campitelli.

Forest Glen station was originally planned to be built above-ground, which would have required the demolition of about fifteen homes. After community opposition to the above-ground station, Montgomery County approved a modified plan for an underground station. The community also opposed the originally planned location for the station, on the east side of Georgia Avenue between Sherwood Road and Tilton Drive. The station opened on September 22, 1990. Forest Glen station is below ground, the deepest train station in the Metrorail system.

Forest Glen has been the subject of redevelopment for many years. In 2017, Montgomery County Park and Planning Commission began the consolidated Forest Glen/Montgomery Hills sector plan review.

In 2018, WMATA announced that it would do a feasibility study on the redevelopment of the parking lot of Forest Glen station.

<text>Glen Echo is a town in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States, that was chartered in 1904. The population was 279 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Glen Echo derives its name from the name of the lots developed by Edward and Edwin Baltzley,&lt;ref name=&quot;glenecho-cabinjohn/GE-01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;glenecho-cabinjohn/GE-02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; father of Louis E. Baltzley, and an inventor, before the town was chartered, and who came up with the name . Their promotional booklet for the land development was titled &quot;Glen Echo on the Potomac: The Washington Rhine&quot;.

The town&#x27;s development was fed by streetcar lines that connected the then-remote area to Washington, D.C.: first, the Glen Echo Railroad, and later the Washington Railway and Electric Company and its successor, the Capital Transit Company.

The town is known for its Chautauqua cultural events&lt;ref name=&quot;glenecho-cabinjohn/GE-03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and for Glen Echo Park, a former amusement park that is now a U.S. national park.

Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, lived in Glen Echo, a streetcar ride from her office, from 1897 until her death in 1912.

Before the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, racial covenants were used in Glen Echo to exclude non-white people. For example, a 1940 covenant for a property owned by Robert McIntosh and Cushing Daniel says, &quot;No persons of any race other than the white race shall use or occupy any building or any lot, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race domiciled with an owner or tenant.&quot;

In the 1980s, Glen Echo designated its town bird as the pileated woodpecker; insect, the spicebush swallowtail; tree, the eastern sycamore; and wildflower, the heartleaf aster.

==Geography==
Glen Echo is located in southern Montgomery County overlooking the Potomac River. Its northeast border is MacArthur Boulevard, while its southwest border is the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. It is bordered to the north by Bannockburn in Bethesda, to the east and south by Brookmont, and to the west by Cabin John.

The Clara Barton Parkway runs through the southwest side of the town, parallel to the C&amp;O Canal. The parkway leads west to the Capital Beltway (I-495) and southeast to Georgetown in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="116482" wikidata="Q753650" url="?curid=116482" title="Kemp Mill, Maryland">
<text>Kemp Mill is a census-designated place and an unincorporated census area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It is known for its creekside walkways, calm suburban atmosphere, Brookside Gardens, and numerous hiking trails. Home to the largest Orthodox Jewish community on the East Coast between Baltimore and Miami, Kemp Mill hosts more than half a dozen synagogues within its boundaries. It is commonly referred to by American Jews as a &quot;shtetl&quot;. The population was 13,378 at the 2020 census.

Kemp Mill census area consists of multiple subdivisions, including Kemp Mill Estates, Kemp Mill Farms, Kemp Mill Forest, and Springbrook Forest. The community also includes University Towers, with 523 condominium units, and the Warwick, with 393 rental units. The neighborhood has over 1,693 houses.

==History==
===Early history===
Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the area that is now Kemp Mill was inhabited by Indigenous peoples, including the Piscataway and the Nacotchtank. Captain John Smith of the English settlement at Jamestown was probably the first European to explore the area, during his travels along the Potomac River and throughout the Chesapeake region.

Evan Thomas, a Quaker minister and political activist, settled the land and established a frame saw and grist mill in 1745, which he named Thomas’ Mill. The mill was sold to Aaron Dyer in 1816, who sold it to Francis Valdenar in 1833. In the 1830s, a small settlement called Claysville sprang up around the mill. The settlement was renamed Kemp Mill in 1857 when George Kemp purchased the mill from Valdenar, and the Kemp family managed the mill until 1905. The mill eventually burned down in 1919, marking the end of 174 years of continuous operation.

===19th century===
In the nineteenth century, much of eastern Montgomery County was dominated by agriculture. The area&#x27;s rolling terrain was ideal for both small and large farms, while the surrounding woodlands provided essential lumber for homes. Early settlers also established mills along the Northwest Branch Anacostia River and Paint Branch, utilizing the streambed gradient to harness hydropower.

In July 1864, during the Civil War, Silver Spring, Maryland (including Kemp Mill) experienced a significant incursion by Confederate forces. As General Jubal Early&#x27;s troops spread across the fields and orchards, reactions among the residents varied, with some cheering, and others fleeing to the capital. The Confederate soldiers ransacked properties, including the estate of Montgomery Blair, Lincoln&#x27;s postmaster general, which they set ablaze. Additionally, Early used the home of Blair&#x27;s father as his headquarters to coordinate an assault on Washington&#x27;s defenses.

===20th century===
The first subdivisions in the greater Kemp Mill area broke ground in 1931. During this era, the nearby Washington suburb of Silver Spring has been described as a sundown town. Prior to the Second World War, racial covenants were used in Washington, D.C. and Silver Spring to exclude African Americans, Jews, and others. In 1948, the Supreme Court Shelley v Kraemer decision rendered racial covenants legally unenforceable, but African Americans, Jews, and others in the Washington metropolitan area continued to be excluded under the covenants until the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

In the early 1930s, property owners in the Kemp Mill area began establishing very large lot subdivisions (five-acre lots) in various areas just outside the initial suburban ring. These developments were intended to be exclusive neighborhoods with a park-like ambiance. Gray&#x27;s Estates in Kemp Mill was one such example. Yeatman Parkway, following a tributary to the Northwest Branch, was dedicated as part of Gray&#x27;s Estates. Today, the parkway is the only remnant of this type of development in Kemp Mill.

A few years after World War II, developers plotted subdivisions with one to five-acre lots near the stream valley parks, anticipating future access to planned sewer systems, as noted on the record plats. Springbrook Forest in Kemp Mill, adjacent to the future Northwest Branch Park, dates back to this phase of suburban expansion.

Kemp Mill Farms and Kemp Mill Estates were first developed in the late 1950s, approximately a decade after the 1948 Supreme Court Shelley v Kraemer decision. The neighborhood was among several communities in Montgomery County&#x27;s Silver Spring area that were built by Jewish real estate developers catering to Jews moving to the suburbs from Washington, D.C. The majority of residences in Kemp Mill are single family homes dating to the 1950s, although newer homes were built in the 1980s and 1990s on Yeatman, Bromley, and Kersey roads.

Kemp Mill Estates was developed by Jack Kay and Harold Greenberg of the Kay Construction Company, the son and son-in-law of real estate developer Abraham S. Kay. At the time of its development, it was located outside of an area of Silver Spring that had been historically closed to Jews. According to the historian David Rotenstein, some Jewish developers in Silver Spring, including the Kays, used anti-Black covenants prior to the Fair Housing Act of 1968. As he said, &quot;to be sure, Jews were barred from many places, too, but our shared Judaism doesn’t immunize us from racism.&quot; However, Rotenstein acknowledged that some Jewish developers also built integrated housing. For example, Morris Milgram began purchasing existing apartments in Silver Spring and integrating them during the early and mid-1960s, and Jewish organizations such as Jews for Urban Justice formed to protest alongside civil rights groups, advocating for equal access to housing.

In the late 1970s, the average price of a home in Kemp Mill was between $85,000 and $90,000. In 1978, a black DC school official living in Kemp Mill was the target of a hate crime when the N-word and &quot;KKK&quot; were painted on her house and her tires were slashed.

Orthodox Jews began moving to Kemp Mill in 1961, when the Young Israel Shomrai Emunah synagogue relocated from Washington, D.C. In 1989, 25% of the 2,000 families in Kemp Mill were Orthodox Jews. A 2005 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article stated that half of the community&#x27;s 10,000 residents were Orthodox Jews.

To support their religious practices, Orthodox Jews in Kemp Mill developed tight-knit communities and constructed eruvim, ritual boundaries that allow for the carrying of objects on Shabbat. These eruvim were creatively made using utility poles, freeway barriers, fences, and strings. An eruv inspector, often seen in tzitzit, kippah, and an orange vest, checks the eruv on Thursdays or Fridays to ensure it is kosher. According to historian David Rotenstein, &quot;there are signs of Jewish adaptations to the landscape everywhere if you know where to look&quot;.

In March 1989, a young Asian man was beaten in nearby Sligo Creek Park by a group of youths and young adults shouting anti-Asian racial slurs. Ten individuals were arrested related to the crime. That same year, there was a spate of antisemitic incidents rumored to be due to skinheads. Swastikas were painted on several vehicles, 40 cars had their windows shot in with BB guns, the graffiti &quot;All Jews Must Die Now&quot; was painted on a sidewalk, and an Orthodox Jewish school was vandalized. A suspect was tried for vandalizing the Orthodox Jewish school after he confessed to the crime to ten people over several months, according to trial testimony. However, police found no physical evidence linking the suspect to the crime, and nobody was convicted. At the time, authorities described the incident at the school as &quot;extraordinarily destructive.&quot;

A community meeting was held and the local police claimed that &quot;youths&quot; were to blame for the antisemitic incidents and that there were no organized neo-Nazis or skinheads in the region. However, a man living in Kemp Mill had recently been convicted for antisemitic vandalism of the Kemp Mill Urban Park, an act the police claimed was inspired by the 1988 film &quot;Betrayed&quot;, which follows the actions of a white supremacist organization.

===21st century===
During the summer of 2020, multiple Black Lives Matter rallies were held at Northwood High School in Kemp Mill as part of the nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. A 2020 statement of solidarity with African Americans issued by the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington was signed by Kemp Mill Synagogue.

In June 2022, shortly before the Shavuot holiday, antisemitic fliers advertising neo-Nazi websites were placed at several locations in Kemp Mill, including at a bus shelter located in front of the Young Israel Shomrai Emunah synagogue and on an ice chest outside of the Shalom Kosher grocery store. The fliers used antisemitic slurs, denied the Holocaust, and called for genocide against the Jewish People.

In February 2023, Northwood High School&#x27;s outdoor facilities were closed to the public due to repeated targeting by an unknown hate group with antisemitic fliers. The fliers were found on the school&#x27;s athletic fields four times, prompting Principal Jonathan Garrick to announce the closure of the facilities, including the athletic fields, track, tennis courts, and other outdoor areas. Although the perpetrators were not apprehended, the GDL had recently been caught vandalizing Jewish properties in nearby Kensington, Maryland. A month later, the ADL reported a 261% spike in antisemitic incidents across Montgomery County over the year, with a concentration of these incidents occurring in Kemp Mill. The county accounted for nearly 60% of antisemitic incidents reported in the state of Maryland in 2022.

In September 2023, multiple reports surfaced of blue-eyed Himalayan cats being found in the Kemp Mill area. The sudden appearance of these rare cats, many of which were in poor health, led to a state-wide media frenzy. The exact origin of the cats was never uncovered, and animal welfare organizations were called upon to help manage the influx.

Following the Simchat Torah Massacre in Israel on October 7, 2023, after a notable uptick in anti-Semitic vandalism was seen in Kemp Mill, the Montgomery County police announced on October 9, 2023, that they were stepping up patrols around synagogues and Jewish schools in the county.

==Culture==
The Kemp Mill area, with its small size and the frequent use of local amenities by residents, has developed into a pedestrian-friendly community. Many people walk to nearby shops, schools, religious institutions, and recreational spots. Each sub-neighborhood within Kemp Mill has its unique character, shaped by similar housing styles and separated by local streets. Most of the residential streets of Kemp Mill consist of winding roads ending in cul-de-sacs. The area features a mix of midcentury split-level homes, 1980s colonials, and ramblers, all set behind sidewalks and grassy front lawns, shaded by oak trees. In 2024, home prices in the neighborhood ranged from $480,000 to $1.3 million.

To the north are Kemp Mill Forest and Springbrook Forest. Kemp Mill Forest, developed in the 1980s using a cluster design, includes both single-family homes and townhouses. Springbrook Forest, one of the oldest neighborhoods, features large lots, narrow streets, and numerous mature trees. The central Kemp Mill neighborhood dates back to the 1950s and 1960s, characterized by traditional suburban development with lots ranging from 6,000 to 9,000 square feet, featuring brick houses.

Three public schools are also situated in the area, including Northwood High School, Odessa Shannon Middle School (Renamed from Colonel E. Brooke Lee Middle School in July 2021), and Kemp Mill Elementary School. The former Spring Mill Elementary school is now the Yeshiva Middle School and an administrative office.
 
 
 


Kemp Mill Shopping Center, along with the public amenities of Kemp Mill Urban Park, collectively function as the community&#x27;s town center. Sidewalks from the neighboring residential developments lead to the shopping center, and a paved trail from Sligo Creek Park also terminates at this central location.

The shopping center is the commerce hub of the neighborhood. It was long anchored by Giant Food, which operated there until September 27, 2007. On November 7, 2007, Magruder&#x27;s, a local grocery chain, opened in its place but closed in July 2012 when Shalom Kosher purchased it. Shalom Kosher opened on October 31, 2012. Besides the grocery store, Kemp Mill Center includes Ben Yehuda Cafe and Pizzeria, The Kosher Pastry Oven, CVS Pharmacy, MVA - Kemp Mill, Nova Europa Restaurant, Holy Chow!, MoneyGram, Truist, Cartronics ATM, Kemp Mill Beer &amp; Wine, U-Haul Neighborhood Dealer, Bright Star Nails, Kemp Mill Dry Cleaners, and Kemp Mill Optical.

<text>Laytonsville is a town in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. The population was 572 at the 2020 census, up from 353 in 2010. Laytonsville was incorporated in 1892.

==History==
Laytonsville was originally known as &quot;Cracklintown&quot;. This name originated from the popular bread, which was baked in the locale. This recipe, essentially a bacon cornbread, also lent the entire area the name of Cracklin District. The original town extended beyond Laytonsville&#x27;s current boundaries, along Sundown Road toward the Hawlings River. The earliest church, school, and store were in this area. The first major road through Cracklintown was built in the early 1800s. This was the Brink-Sundown Road, referred to in documents from the early 1800s as the &quot;road from the mouth of the Monocacy to Ellicotts Mills.&quot;

The road which would become Route 108 appears in the historical record to have been added in the very early 1800s. This crossroads provided a major artery for cattle and pigs headed for the bustling markets of Baltimore to the east, and established the town as a comfortable stopover for the drovers. By the early nineteenth century, substantial brick buildings were being constructed, such as the Layton House and a tavern across the road. By 1850, the southeast corner of the crossroads was developed. Much of the rest of the town along Route 108 was not developed until the 1870s.

A second reason for the development of the town was the successful farming in the area. Laytonsville farmers were blessed by the quality of the soil, a Manor loam or Chester loam, very fertile and well drained, but a soil which does not dry out too quickly. Under the loam lies a subsoil of red clay which assists in holding the moisture for roots even during hot, dry summers.

Laytonsville was incorporated in 1892.

In 1916, the area was incorporated as the special tax district of Martin&#x27;s First, Second, Third and Fourth Additions to the Village of Chevy Chase.

In February 1985, the residents voted in a referendum on whether to incorporate as a town. The vote was 198 to 15 in favor of incorporation. Following approval of Montgomery County and the U.S. state of Maryland, the special tax district was incorporated as a municipality called the Village of Martin&#x27;s Additions on March 19, 1985. The first elected village council members were Michael E. Zielinski, Edward C. Holland, Lucy Foa, Karen McManus, and Paul S. Weller.

Before the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, racial covenants were used in Martin&#x27;s Additions to exclude African-Americans. For example, a 1905 deed for a property owned by Harry M. Martin in H.M. Martin&#x27;s 3rd Addition says, &quot;That the property hereby conveyed, either before or after improvements are made, cannot be rented, sold, leased or otherwise placed in possession of a colored man or one of the African race.&quot;

Subsequent purchases were the Thomas Farm, The Mills Farm, The French Farm, The Patton Farm, The Fulks Farm, The Wilson Farm, and The James Walter Deppa property. The Walker Farm was the largest of all the properties the Kettlers bought. It was and now is Walkers Choice, Cider Mill, Horizon Run, Christopher Court, Dockside, Nathan&#x27;s Hill, Millrace, the Montgomery Village Library, Montgomery Village Day-Care Center, the Off-Price Centers, Bayberry, the Verandahs, Grover&#x27;s Forge, Lake Whetstone, South Valley Park, and part of Lakeforest Mall.

<text>North Bethesda is an unincorporated, census-designated place (CDP) in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States, located just north-west of the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C. It had a population of 50,094 as of the 2020 census. Among its neighborhoods, the centrally-located, urbanizing district of White Flint is the commercial and residential hub of North Bethesda. The Pike &amp; Rose development and the Pike District is an initiative of Montgomery County to brand and market this region as &quot;North Bethesda&#x27;s Urban Core&quot;. The WMATA (formerly White Flint) metro station and metro station serve the region.

Four of the National Institutes of Health as well other federal agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, are headquartered in North Bethesda. A number of corporate headquarters are headquartered in North Bethesda, as well as nonprofits such as the American Kidney Fund, the Society of American Foresters and United States Pharmacopeia (USP).

The region is also known for a number of its long-standing institutions, such as the Neo-Georgian Mansion at Strathmore and the Georgetown Preparatory School. The Music Center at Strathmore is also located in North Bethesda.

==Geography==

As an unincorporated area four miles (6.4 km) northwest of Washington, D.C., North Bethesda&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined. North Bethesda is, however, recognized by the United States Census Bureau and by the United States Geological Survey as a census-designated place for statistical purposes. North Bethesda borders the city of Rockville to the north, and the unincorporated census-designated places of Bethesda and Potomac to the south and west respectively.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the North Bethesda CDP has a total area of , all land.

Significant through-roads in North Bethesda include Interstates 270 and 495 and Maryland State Highways 187 (Old Georgetown Road), 355 (Rockville Pike), and 547 (Strathmore Avenue). The , (formerly White Flint), and Washington Metro stations all serve the area, as does the Ride On and Metrobus bus systems. A future MARC station is planned as well.

Other landmarks in the area are the Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School, the Kennedy-Shriver Aquatic Center (formerly the Montgomery County Aquatic Center), The Jewish Community Center, the Linden Oak tree, from which the metro was diverted from in an effort to preserve it, and North Bethesda Market, the tallest building in Montgomery County.

Major shopping centers include Pike &amp; Rose (formerly Mid-Pike Plaza), Montrose Crossing, and Federal Plaza. The former White Flint Mall, demolished in 2016, was also a major shopping center.

==History==
North Bethesda shares a common history with most of its Montgomery County neighbors. Archaeological evidence suggests that Paleo, Archaic, and Woodland Native Americans lived nearby, along the banks of the Potomac River. These peoples traveled along an ancient route known as the Seneca Trail (which is today approximately followed in North Bethesda by Old Georgetown Road). Like many ancient roads, the Seneca Trail followed a ridge line – in this case, the high ground between the Potomac River and Rock Creek. Much later, development would spring up along this route.

The recorded history of the area commences with the colonial era. Settlements formed along Rock Creek and the Seneca Trail in the 17th century, with recorded land grants in this area known originally as “Dan” and “Leeke Forest.” The far southern edge of the North Bethesda CDP was originally the country estate of the Grosvenor family, whose lineage includes Alexander Graham Bell and a former President of the National Geographic Society. That region continues to bear the family&#x27;s name, and is the location of the headquarters of the Renewable Natural Resources Foundation. Also in the southern sector of the census designated area, located in the triangle between the two limbs of I-270 and I-495, is a business district that includes several corporate and government agency headquarters.
In the early 19th century, much of the area was part of a tobacco plantation owned by a slaveowning family with the surname of Riley. One of the Rileys&#x27; slaves, Josiah Henson, is thought by historians to be the inspiration for Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&quot; In 1806, the Washington Turnpike Company was chartered to improve the old Seneca route, by then known as the Georgetown-Frederick Road. The road was opened in 1828, but had nearly washed away by 1848. The Riley plantation house was located on this road, and the plantation house&#x27;s kitchen (in which Henson is known to have slept) still stands near the course of this road.

By the late 19th century, the area was privileged with stops along a train route, and by the early 20th century with its own trolley tracks on the line connecting Georgetown and Rockville (along current-day Fleming Avenue). During this time, development bloomed around train and trolley stops, and a number of wealthy families, including those of Captain James F. Oyster and Charles I. Corby (who developed methods that revolutionized the baking industry), lived or summered in the area. Nonetheless, the area remained sparsely populated through the 1920s.

The arrival of the automobile eventually transformed the area into a commuter suburb of Washington, D.C. By the 1950s, the area had sprouted a number of developer-conceived neighborhoods with tract houses for the middle-class.

While some traditional neighborhoods remain, other areas have struggled with issues related to suburban sprawl. Like most other suburbs in Montgomery County, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC) engages in master planning for all development. The White Flint Master Plan is designed to alleviate negative aspects of future high-density development in North Bethesda.

==Disputed existence==
The existence of North Bethesda as an actual place with distinct boundaries has been mistakenly questioned by local residents and online commenters. Skeptics frequently dismiss the census-designated place as just a southern portion of Rockville rather than a defined place and the name as a neologism coined by realtors.

The reason for the misconception includes the lack of identity, especially as most of North Bethesda lies in the 20852 ZIP code it shares with Rockville and uses the Rockville postal address, whereas the eastern part of the CDP uses the Kensington address and ZIP code, and the southern regions has the 20814 zip code of Bethesda proper.

Adding to the confusion, the Rockville location of Whole Foods Market is in the North Bethesda Market on Rockville Pike, and the county&#x27;s growth plan for the area was titled &quot;White Flint,&quot; the name used by the demolished White Flint Mall and the since renamed White Flint (now ) station of the Washington Metro Red Line. Beginning in the mid-2010s, developers sought to rebrand the area around the metro station as &quot;Pike District&quot;. In addition, North Bethesda Middle School is located in Bethesda.

Despite the accusation that the real estate business uses &quot;North Bethesda&quot; to associate the area with the ritzier Bethesda rather than Rockville, some realtors point out that customers and agents don&#x27;t always search for &quot;North Bethesda&quot;, and the inconsistency between the place name and postal address can be a liability.

==Education==

*Garrett Park Elementary School

<text>North Chevy Chase is a incorporated village in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It was established as a special tax district in 1924 and incorporated as a village in 1996. The population was 682 at the 2020 census, up from 519 in 2010.

Residential development of the area began in the early 20th century when William H. Walker laid out a community and began selling lots. The area was crossed by the Chevy Chase Lake &amp; Kensington Railway, a two-mile streetcar line built in 1895 to connect the new town of Kensington to the northern terminus of the Rock Creek Railway streetcar line from the District of Columbia.

In 1924, residents incorporated as a special tax district. 

After the streetcar line shut down in 1935, Montgomery County purchased much of the right-of-way, paved it, and opened it in 1940 as Kensington Parkway, the area&#x27;s main road.

North Chevy Chase was officially incorporated as a village in 1996.

<text>North Potomac is a census-designated place and unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It is located less than north of the Potomac River, and is about from Washington, D.C. It has a population of 23,790 as of 2020.

The region&#x27;s land was originally used for growing tobacco, which was replaced by wheat and dairy farming after the soil became depleted. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was used by local farmers to ship their grain (or flour made from the grain at the local mills), and two former canal locks are located less than away in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. In addition, infrastructure remains for what was one of the state&#x27;s leading dairy farms during the first half of the 20th century.

North Potomac did not get an identity of its own until 1989, when the United States Post Office allowed the use of the North Potomac name for what is mostly a collection of housing sub-divisions, farms, and wooded parks. The United States Census Bureau listed a North Potomac in 1970 but not 1980. In 2000, it began recognizing North Potomac as a census designated place. Today, the community benefits from its proximity to workplaces such as the Shady Grove Hospital area and the I-270 Technology Corridor. Washington, D.C. is accessible by automobile or public transportation. The median household income is nearly $160,000, and nearly half of the eligible residents have a graduate or professional degree.

==History==
Captain John Smith explored the Potomac River in 1608 and mapped the area, including land that would become Montgomery County. The first settlements were established in 1688, and were near Rock Creek and what became Rockville. The next stage of settlements was further west along the Potomac near Darnestown and Poolesville. The land had been occupied by Native Americans of the Piscataway Confederation. Modern-day Darnestown Road, which forms the northern border of North Potomac, was a trail of the indigenous Seneca people and is one of the oldest roads in Montgomery County.

Originally, the land around present-day North Potomac was used by European settlers to grow tobacco and corn. During the 19th century, a network of roads, mills, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (a.k.a. C&amp;O Canal) provided farmers with better access to markets. Dufief Mill Road, which runs through the center of North Potomac, leads to the DuFief Mill (established 1850)—one of the mills that were used by farmers in this part of Montgomery County. By 1840, much of the county&#x27;s soil was depleted. Quakers began introducing improved farming practices and agriculture was revitalized. By 1860, farmers were growing corn, wheat and oats.

In 1878, today&#x27;s North Potomac was still farmland. The nearest general stores and post offices were in Hunting Hill, Travilah, and Darnestown. The Hunting Hill Post Office and general store was located on Darnestown Road between Muddy Branch Road and Travilah Road, and it also provided wheelwright and blacksmith services. It operated from 1873 until 1929. Darnestown had three country stores, and the Windsor store also served as a Post Office until 1911. Travilah, located closer to the canal, had a general store but no name in 1878. The Travilah Post Office was established in 1883, and the community eventually took that name. Eventually, some of the farmland was sold. During the Great Depression, some farmers became eager to sell their land because of financial hardship. Wealthy individuals began buying property in the Potomac area as part of their search for land where they could ride horses and hunt. Some of this equestrian heritage continues in North Potomac today at the Potomac Horse Center. Mortgage banker Frederick Harting established this training facility, for horses and riders, in the early 1960s. It was purchased by Montgomery County in 1981 and has been the site of horse shows.

Several area farms, such as the 355-acre (144 ha) Maple Spring Farm, continued well into the 20th century. Much of this farm&#x27;s land was sold in the 1970s and became North Potomac&#x27;s Dufief subdivision. In 1970, the United States Census Bureau considered North Potomac an unincorporated place that was part of the Darnestown and Travilah areas. By 1989, North Potomac consisted of about 25 housing subdivisions mixed with old farms. About 80 percent of those subdivisions were built since 1983. In late 1989, the United States Postal Service approved the North Potomac name for a region surrounded by the Montgomery County communities of Darnestown, Travilah, Gaithersburg and Rockville. ZIP Codes were not changed, so most of North Potomac uses the 20878 code used by Gaithersburg and part of Darnestown. In 1990, North Potomac began being listed by the Census Bureau as a census-designated place, but census records show no data for 1980. The last major farm in the area is the Hanson Farm, and work began in 2009 for approval to build single-family homes on the farmland.

===Historic places===
The historic DuFief Mill site is located near the intersection of Turkey Foot Road and the Muddy Branch in Muddy Branch Regional Park. John L. DuFief built a mill complex in the 1850s that was about from the C&amp;O Canal. A road connected his gristmill, blacksmith&#x27;s shop, and miller&#x27;s house to the Pennyfield Lock on the C&amp;O Canal, where he operated a warehouse, barrel house, and wharf. The canal was necessary because the Potomac River was not navigable by ships and barges at Great Falls. Construction of the C&amp;O Canal, which began in the 1830s and was completed in 1850, opened the region to important markets and lowered shipping costs. After DuFief established this mill and its access to the canal, more roads were constructed, which enabled him to serve farmers from as far away as Germantown and Damascus in addition to the local growers.

Three other sites of historic significance remain in North Potomac. The privately owned Maple Spring Barns are located at the intersection of Dufief Mill Road and Darnestown Road, and were part of one of the largest dairy farms in Maryland during the 20th century. The Pleasant View Historic Site consists of the Pleasant View Methodist Episcopal Church (chapel built in 1914), Pleasant View Cemetery, and the Quince Orchard Colored School (built in 1901). All structures are located on the south side of Darnestown Road near the Quince Orchard area. The church&#x27;s congregation was established around 1868. The Poplar Grove Baptist Church, located on Jones Lane, is the sole surviving 19th century Baptist church of an African-American congregation in Montgomery County. The church was built in 1893 near a tributary of the Muddy Branch, and immersion baptisms are said to have taken place in the tributary during the church&#x27;s early years.

==Geography==
As an unincorporated area, North Potomac&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined. However, the United States Census Bureau recognized a North Potomac in the 1970 census, and then as a census-designated place (North Potomac CDP) in every census since 1990. As of the 2010 census, North Potomac is located north of the Potomac River in west central Montgomery County, roughly from Washington, D.C. It is bordered to the north by Gaithersburg, which lies beyond Maryland Route 28 (Darnstown Road). Rockville, along Glen Road, is on the east border, while the Travilah CDP, mostly along Travilah Road, forms the southern border. The Darnestown CDP along Jones Lane and Turkey Foot Road forms the western boundary. Like North Bethesda, residents have held misconceptions about North Potomac&#x27;s existence, incorrectly arguing that it is part of Gaithersburg and that the name is a neologism created by realtors.

Between the 1990 and 2000 census, North Potomac gained and lost land. The loss was caused when a portion of the North Potomac territory, plus Potomac territory, was used to create the Travilah census designated place. According to the United States Census Bureau, North Potomac has a total area of , virtually all land. The Muddy Branch and its tributary Rich Branch are streams that run through North Potomac, and the Muddy Branch empties into the Potomac River. The United States Geological Survey lists two features in Montgomery County with North Potomac in all or part of their name. The North Potomac Census Designated Place is listed with an elevation of , while the North Potomac Populated Place has an elevation of .

<text>Poolesville is a U.S. town in the western portion of Montgomery County, Maryland. The population was 5,742 at the 2020 United States Census. It is surrounded by (but is technically not part of) the Montgomery County Agricultural Reserve, and is considered a distant bedroom community for commuters to Washington, D.C.

The name of the town comes from the brothers John Poole Sr. and Joseph Poole Sr. who owned land and slaves in what is now Poolesville. Due to an historical anomaly, until 2010 the legal name of the town was &quot;The Commissioners of Poolesville&quot;. Residents overwhelmingly voted to formally change the name to &quot;The Town of Poolesville&quot; in the November 2010 general election.

==History==
In 1760, brothers John Poole Sr. and Joseph Poole Sr. purchased acres in the area that is now Poolesville. Thirty-three years later, John Poole Jr. used a tract that he inherited from his father to build a log store and subdivided the tract, selling portions to a number of other merchants. The settlement grew from there and was incorporated in 1867.

During the Civil War, Union military leaders realized that the shallow fords of the Potomac River posed a threat to the capital city. At certain times of the year, the Potomac River is shallow enough to cross and thus thousands of troops were moved to both Darnestown and Poolesville. The Corps of Observation was established just outside Poolesville and soldiers were stationed near the river to monitor potential Confederate incursions into Maryland. During the winter of 1861–1862, it is estimated that 20,000 Union troops were stationed in or around the town. There were no battles fought in Poolesville; however, the infamous Battle of Ball&#x27;s Bluff was fought nearby on October 21, 1861. Hundreds of Union soldiers who were stationed in Poolesville were killed in this battle that was badly managed by inexperienced Union generals.

There were several Confederate raids into the town during the war, and the Confederate Army invaded Maryland by crossing the Potomac near Poolesville in 1862 and 1864. The old Poolesville Methodist Church cemetery contains the remains of approximately twenty soldiers who either were killed in action at Ball&#x27;s Bluff or who died of illness while in camp.

The Seneca Schoolhouse, a small one-room schoolhouse of red sandstone, was built in Poolesville in 1866 to educate the children of the stone cutters who worked at the Seneca Quarry. Operating as the Seneca Schoolhouse Museum, it provides tours to schoolchildren so that they can experience a typical school day as it would have been on March 13, 1880.

The Kunzang Palyul Choling Buddhist temple opened in Poolesville in 1985.

The Poolesville Historic District was listed in 1975 on the National Register of Historic Places.

In December 2020, White&#x27;s Ferry, a ferry service west of the town across the Potomac River that a number of citizens have depended on for their livelihoods, ceased service due to a legal conflict between the ferry and Rockland Farm over ownership of land on the banks of the river. As of April 2024, the ferry has not yet reopened due to the legal conflict, though the owners have offered to donate the ferry to the Montgomery County government.

<text>Potomac () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 47,018. It is named after the nearby Potomac River. A part of the Washington metropolitan area, many Potomac residents work in nearby Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia.

==History==
The land that is now Potomac was first settled by Edward Offutt in 1714 after he was granted a land grant of a region known as Clewerwell by Lord Baltimore. His grant of land was by the Tehogee Indian Trail, an Indian trade route built by the Canaze Native American nation in 1716. Throughout the 18th century, what became known as &quot;Offutts Crossroads&quot; was a small, rural community which served planters and travelers. In the 19th century, a few small dwellings had been built along with a tavern established in 1820. By the time of the Civil War, the community contained two general stores, a blacksmith shop, and a post office which served a community of 100.

Offutts Crossroads was renamed &quot;Potomac&quot; in 1881 by John McDonald. An Irishman and veteran of the Civil War, McDonald settled in Potomac around that time. He petitioned for the name change since postal officials were asking for brief names and there were already several other communities in the area with the name &quot;crossroads&quot;.

By the turn of the 20th century, Potomac was growing. Thomas Perry, an operator of a nearby general store, built a house on the corner of Falls and River Roads in 1902. More residential structures were built on the northern section of Falls Road throughout the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1950s, Potomac was one of many communities in Montgomery County to experience suburbanization because of its proximity to Washington, D.C. Potomac quickly transformed from a rural farming community to a suburban community from the mid- to late 20th century.

Numerous original buildings within Potomac Village have been demolished for the construction of strip malls and modern office buildings. However, in the surrounding area, many of the old farmhouses remain, though some are confined within suburban developments. The Perry Store has been restored and still stands as part of a bank, although the building was moved 21 feet in 1986 to allow for a project to widen the intersection of Falls and River Roads.

<text>Leisure World is a census-designated place and unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It is an age-restricted, gated development primarily inhabited by retirees. As of the 2020 census it had a population of 9,215. Leisure World was known as the Rossmoor census-designated place for the 2000 census.

==History==
===Development===
In 1963, developer Ross Cortese applied for a zoning amendment in order to build a 1,000-acre community of semi-detached homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings south of Norbeck, Maryland. Cortese&#x27;s company had acquired the option to buy the 1,000 acres of land, formerly known as the Nash tract, for $5,000,000, and Cortese expected it would cost another $750,000 to build the development according to the plans. The development would be restricted to residents who are at least 52 years old. Cortese planned to build clubhouses, a swimming pool, riding stables, an auditorium, a shopping center, medical facilities, a hotel for guests, an 18-hole golf course, and an 8-acre lake at the site. Sixty-five percent of the area would be undeveloped green space. The entire site would be surrounded by a wall, and full-time security guards would restrict access. According to the plans, co-op homes would be available for between $15,000 and $18,000, payable with a $1,000 down payment and monthly payments thereafter of between $140 and $180. Cortese had already built Rossmoor Leisure World at Seal Beach, California, in 1961, and he was then building Leisure World Laguna Hills in Laguna Hills, California, and another Leisure World in Walnut Creek, California.

The Montgomery County Council approved the zoning amendment by a vote of 3 to 1, with 3 abstentions. The one dissenting council member was Kathryn E. Diggs, who said she was skeptical that the development would be economically successful. Local citizen groups opposed building the development because they preferred the area to remain zoned for low-density development. The Council had been planning to extend Connecticut Avenue through the area, but the Council put that action on hold because of the proposed development. Within a few months, Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission approved 28,000 feet of water and sewer lines for the development. The architecture firm of Collins &amp; Kronstadt designed the housing units and the community buildings. Thurman D. Donavan designed the landscaping, which received an award by the industrial landscaping committee of the American Association of Nurserymen in November 1966. A large rotating globe was installed at the front gate.

Leisure World&#x27;s sales office and model homes opened in August 1965; Loy Sigmon was the interior designer of the original seven model homes. J. Robert Conybeare served as general sales manager, and Angus T. Johnson was named the first administrator of the community.

The community was marketed to people who wanted to stay active while living there. While residence was restricted to people at least 52 years old (later reduced to 50 years old), proof of age was not originally required. Leisure World allowed people of all races to live in the community.

The community facilities were held in trust by the Foundation of Leisure World, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, with former Under Secretary of the Navy Kenneth E. BeLieu as its first president. Homes were sold as co-ops, with prices starting at $15,000 and ongoing monthly maintenance payments of at least $85. Within six months, 400 home units had been pre-sold.

===Shopping center===
Plans for Leisure World&#x27;s 100,000-square-foot shopping center were announced in October 1965. The plan was to sell 9,200 residential units within five years, enough space for approximately 15,640 people to live. Commercial leases were signed with Safeway, Peoples Drug Stores, Hot Shoppes cafeteria-style restaurant, and Maryland National Bank for space at the adjoining shopping center. The Interfaith Meeting House broke ground on October 22, 1965, with plans for a capacity for 500 people.

===First residents===
The first residents moved in on August 15, 1965. The community held a welcoming ceremony at the eighteenth hole of the golf course for the first residents. The first residents lived in twelve units on Gleneagles Drive. The first nine holes of the golf course opened June 1, 1966.

===Slowdown on sales===
In early 1967, Leisure World changed its marketing focus from that of a retirement community to that of a country club community for adults. Sales of units at Leisure World were suspended in September 1967 after a tight mortgage market significantly increased prices and lower than expected interest. Sales resumed on January 1, 1968. Sales were still slow, the developer&#x27;s carrying costs on the remaining vacant land were large, and the U.S. state of Maryland had prohibited further development in the area until a new sewage treatment plant was built, all of which temporarily prevented additional construction. The developer said it would need to develop the remaining vacant land eventually, as the additional residents were needed in order to support the common facilities by way of monthly maintenance fees. In October 1974, Leisure World canceled the sales contracts for 480 semidetached homes and low-rise apartments because inflation had increased construction costs and it was no longer certain when the units would actually be built. Five months later, Leisure World offered the units for sale again at increased prices. In September 1976, the developer agreed to build the 300,000-gallon wastewater treatment plant. Almost one year later, the developer sued the state of Maryland, saying Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission failed to complete a 1965 contract to provide water and sewer connections to the area because the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene had ordered a halt to sewer connections in 1973. The developer also said it was strong-armed into building a sewage treatment facility by the Montgomery County government in order to avoid significant financial losses.

John E. Byrne, Jr., manager of Leisure World, agreed to buy Leisure World from Ross Coriese in August 1968, but the sale was not completed. In April 1969, Crane Company agreed to buy Leisure World from Coriese. That agreement was broken four months later by mutual consent. In February 1970, Zero Manufacturing Company agreed to buy Rossmoor Corporation, the developer of Leisure World.

===Fires===
On March 1, 1968, there was a fire in a model two-story townhouse on Gleneagles Drive at Leisure World. Approximately 100 firefighters reported to the fire. The fire caused damage to four townhouses, estimated at $100,000. There was one injury; Chief Sidney Bailey of Sandy Spring Fire Department was treated for burns to the eye. A fire killed a woman in her home on Chiswick Court in October 1969. In May 1976, there was a fire in a three-story apartment building on Glen Eagle Drive. One-hundred firefighters reported to the fire. The only injury was a firefighter with a broken thumb. The fire destroyed twelve homes, and those twelve families had to move in with friends and families. In November 2020, an early morning fire left one person dead and displaced 40 other residents.

===Changes in plans===
Leisure World asked Montgomery County for approval to reduce its resident age minimum from 50 to 40 years old, but Montgomery County disapproved the change. On August 12, 1968, Leisure World asked Montgomery County Planning Board to remove the age limit altogether, but the Montgomery County Planning Board disapproved the change. On August 23, 1968, Leisure World made another request to drop the age limit for almost half the land, and Montgomery County Planning Board disapproved the request again. Montgomery County Planning Board had agreed to change the land&#x27;s zoning from low density to higher density on the condition that all residents would be of age 50 or older and, in a vote of 4–1, Montgomery County Planning Board would not let Leisure World out of its agreement. On December 31, 1968, the Montgomery County Council voted to allow the change to the age limit for about 40 percent of the land, despite the objections by the Montgomery County Planning Board. A part of the negotiation, Leisure World agreed to develop the unrestricted portion of land as a separate development. In February 1971, three families living nearby filed a lawsuit to prevent construction of about 2,500 homes. The plaintiffs contended that the population of the 2,500 homes without age restrictions would be much larger than originally intended because many of the units would be occupied by families. The plaintiffs said that the additional residents would cause an increase in public service costs and a decrease in their property values.

==Geography==
As an unincorporated area, Leisure World&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined, but are unofficially defined by a fence around the community.

Leisure World is, however, recognized by the United States Census Bureau and by the United States Geological Survey as a census-designated place.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the place has a total area of , all land.

<text>Somerset is an incorporated town in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States, located near the border with Washington, D.C. The population was 1,187 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
The land that would become Somerset was originally a part of the 3,124-acre Friendship Tract patented by Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore, to Col. Thomas Addison and James Stoddart in 1711. By 1811, a 211-acre portion of that tract, dubbed Friendship, was owned by Richard Williams, a farmer.

In 1890, John Beall and Ralph Walsh sold 50 acres to five scientists who worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture: Charles A. Crampton, Harvey W. Wiley, Daniel E. Salmon, Miles Fuller, and Horace Horton, who had established the Somerset Heights Colony Company. Their plans were described in the &quot;Washington Evening Post&quot;&#x27;s May 17, 1890, issue: &quot;...the scientific men of the Dept. of Agriculture...selected a tract of 50 acres of rolling land adjoining the property of General Drum just across the DC line in Mont. County. The Company will begin operations by providing the property with good system of sewerage, a bountiful supply of water and electric lights from Georgetown and Tenallytown Electric Railway Company. The lots are to contain not less than one acre...suburb fashioned after the very pleasant ones of Boston and other northern cities.&quot;

Five early streets were arranged; they remain to this day: Dorset Avenue, Warwick Place, Surrey Street, Cumberland Avenue, and Essex Avenue, after the English counties.

The first home was built in 1893 on Dorset Avenue and occupied by Crampton, assistant chief of the Bureau of Chemistry. He was followed by Wiley, chief of the Bureau of Chemistry and father of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906; Salmon, chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry and discoverer of salmonella, who built Clover Crest; Fuller, chief clerk of the Bureau of Animal Industry and the partnership&#x27;s business manager; and E. A. deSweinitz, chief of the Biochemic Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry, who took over Horton&#x27;s shares.

The house built by Wiley and later owned by Arthur Cuming Ringland would be named the Wiley-Ringland House and added to the National Park Service&#x27;s National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The home built by Salmon, later named the Salmon-Stohlman House, was added to the National Park Services&#x27; National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

By 1905, there were 35 residences. Marketed as an area of &quot;tranquility and refinement&quot;, the original Town was plagued by inadequate water drainage, a makeshift sewage system, and the absence of local fire protection and schools. These problems prompted the local citizens to petition the State of Maryland for incorporation into a township so that taxes could be levied to provide these basic services. The Town Charter was issued on April 5, 1906, forming the community of Somerset Heights and the surrounding areas into the Town of Somerset.

54 of the original residences now form the Somerset Historic District located within the Town. 31 of these residences are considered primary resources having been built prior to 1905. This Historic District has gone through four phases of development that represent the changing styles of the Town. 1893-1904 was marked by large frame Victorian and Queen Anne houses, 1900-1915 by smaller bungalows and craftsmen houses, 1915-1940 by brick and frame Colonial Revival houses, and 1940–present by Modern and Neo-Colonial houses.

The first Town Council was elected on May 7, 1906, and Crampton was elected as the first mayor. Crampton was succeeded as mayor by Jesse Swigart, elected in 1910; Warren W. Biggs in 1912, and Charles S. Moore in 1916. Moore was followed by J. William Stohlman in 1919, W. B. Horne in 1938, and Irvin M. Day in 1940.

The Bergdoll family based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania owned a large tract of land directly south of Somerset and in 1943 sought to build apartments by seeking a zoning change. After the family was denied, the Bergdoll Estate held three auctions in 1946 and 1947 for the land which became part of Somerset. This land would become unofficially known as Lower Somerset or New Somerset and the expanded street grid added Falstone Avenue, Grantham Avenue, Trent Street, Uppingham Street, and Greystone Street. The original street grid would unofficially become known as Upper Somerset or Old Somerset. The lots of the former Bergdoll tract were placed under racial covenants barring their sale to non-white people. Such racist restrictions were rendered unenforceable by the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

William F. Betts was elected mayor in 1954, followed by Frederick W. Turnbull in 1956, and Warren jay Vinton in 1958. Vinton was followed by Jerald F. Goldberg in 1969, Walter J. Behr in 1975, A. Eugene Miller in 1982, and Walter J. Behr who was reelected in 1986.

In 1988, Town residents voted in a referendum to de-annex a parcel of land containing three large apartment buildings under construction, to avoid having the Town Council and services shift from representing the single-family homeowners to becoming representative of a condo community. Residents of the Somerset House complex would have out-numbered the single-family home dwellers by 3–1. The complex was constructed on the last large undeveloped woodlot in Somerset, and construction had been blocked by legal challenges for over two decades.

The current mayor of Somerset is Jeffrey Z. Slavin who was elected in 2008.

<text>Travilah is a United States census-designated place and an unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland. It is located along the north side of the Potomac River, and surrounded by the communities of Potomac, North Potomac, and Darnestown—all census-designated places. It had a population of 11,985 as of the 2020 census.

Within the Travilah census-designated place at the intersection of what are now Travilah Road and Glen Road, the small rural community of Travilah existed in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The community had its own post office, general store, school, town hall, church, and a few homes. The crossroads was popular with area farmers because it was close to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&amp;O Canal) and at least two mills. The name Travilah comes from Travilah Clagett, who was the community&#x27;s first postmaster in 1883.

In 2000, the United States Census Bureau began recognizing the area around the original Travilah crossroads community as a census designated place. Much of this tranquil community is simply large homes on large tracts of land with numerous parks and nature preserves mixed in. The community is within driving-distance of Washington, D.C., and the I-270 Technology Corridor. Travilah has a median household income of about $235,000.

==Geography==

As an unincorporated area, Travilah&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined. However, the United States Census Bureau began recognizing a Travilah census-designated place (Travilah CDP) in the 2000 Census when the new Travilah CDP was created using portions of the Potomac and North Potomac CDPs. According to the state of Maryland, &quot;The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.&quot; The boundaries of the Travilah CDP are currently those used in the 2010 Census. The Travilah CDP is surrounded by the Darnestown CDP, the North Potomac CDP, the city of Rockville, the Potomac CDP, and the Potomac River—and the old crossroads community of Travilah is located in the west central portion of the CDP.

According to the 2000 Census, the Travilah CDP is part rural and part urban. The urban portion had a 2000 population of 6,894 on , while the rural portion has a 2000 population of 548 on a land area of . An additional of non-land is located in the rural section. The 2010 Census shows a total population of 12,159 in 3,950 housing units on a land area of and total area of . Using 2010 Census Data, Travilah has a GIS ID of 303 and a FID of 302. The State FIPS code is 24 and the Place FIPS is 78650. The ANSI Code for Travilah is 02390400 and the Place Identifier is 2478650.

==History==
The Travilah community has a long history that dates back to the 1800s at a crossroads at what is now Travilah Road and Glen Road. A small unnamed agricultural community grew at this intersection in the mid-1800s because it was less than from the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (a.k.a. C&amp;O Canal). The intersecting roads also led to mills that were located within a few miles of the intersection, and many of the area farms produced the wheat used by the mills to make flour.

The community had a general store in 1882 that may have existed as early as the 1840s. In 1883, the unnamed community was assigned a Post Office. Travilah Clagett was the first postmaster, and the United States Post Office used the name Travilah to identify the unnamed location. The Clagetts were prominent land owners in this portion of Montgomery County. Clagett served as postmaster for about half the year, and died from tuberculosis before the year was over.

In addition to the general store, the crossroads had a blacksmith, church, schoolhouse, and town hall. The Travilah Baptist Church was built in 1894 and had over 300 members in 1976. It was destroyed by fire in 1980. A Travilah Elementary School exists today at the intersection of Dufief Mill Road and Travilah Road in North Potomac, but it should not be confused with the one-room schoolhouse formerly located at the Travilah crossroads that closed in 1943 (and later burned down). The original schoolhouse was built in 1865. A town hall was built in 1910, and the building still exists today although it is privately owned. The general store, which eventually was also a gas station, closed in 1967.

A small corner shopping center, built in 1979, is located at the Travilah Road-Glen Road intersection. The center was originally named Glenvilah Shopping Center, but was renamed Potomac Oak Center in honor of the historic Travilah Oak tree located there close to Travilah Road. Several homes were also located in the area and a large 150-year-old farmhouse remains across from the shopping center.

==Historic sites==
Montgomery County has a long history that began over 300 years ago. The Travilah area has some historic sites, although some are privately owned. For example, the original Travilah Town Hall, built in 1910, still stands—but it is privately owned. The historic Travilah Baptist Church, built in 1894, burned down in 1980.

===Harrison and Ada Ward Farm===
The Harrison and Ada Ward Farm was built around 1885, and prospered in part because it was located not far from the Pennyfield Lock on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal on what is now Travilah Road. The farm originally grew wheat, corn, and hay, and later raised dairy cows. The farm&#x27;s bright red bank barn, which has exceptional architectural detail, is located right next to the road.

===Pennyfield Lock House===
The Pennyfield Lock House (Lock #22) is located in the western portion of the Travilah CDP in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The lock house was built around 1830, and its lock was completed around 1831. John L. DuFief built a mill around 1850 on the Muddy Branch, and it had a road that connected to the Pennyfield Lock. His mill had the capacity to manufacture 10–12,000 barrels of flour per year, and a network of roads grew that enabled farmers to get their crops to the mill and canal. The DuFief Mill was about from the Travilah crossroads, and an alternative mill (Glen Mill) was 3.3 miles away. The small community of Travilah thrived because of its crossroads location and proximity to the canal. The canal was completed as far north as Cumberland, Maryland, by 1850 (and never did reach the Ohio River), and one fourth of its are in Montgomery County. By 1859, about 83 barges per week were using the canal to transport coal, grain, flour, and farm products to Washington and Georgetown.

===Swain&#x27;s Lock House===
Swains Lock House (Lock #21) is located in the eastern portion of the Travilah CDP in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The lock and lock house were built in 1831. The house is one of the largest canal lock houses, and made from oversized sandstone bricks. Jesse Swain was lock keeper beginning in 1907, and had been a canal boatman. His father (John) had helped with the canal construction, and his grandson (Fred) has lived in the house and operated an onsite concession stand into the 21st century. At least two Swain children, and a cousin, were born in the house. The family lived in the house until 2006, when the National Park Service took over maintenance. Today, picnic tables are located between the Potomac River and the lock and lock house.

===Tobytown cemetery===
The Tobytown Cemetery, which is located off River Road near the Pennyfield Lock, is the only remaining relic associated with the black community of Tobytown that was established in 1875 by former slaves. The community was established by William Davis, Ailsie Martin, and Emory Genus, and is believed to be named for Ailsie Martin&#x27;s son—Tobias Martin. The cemetery contains about 25 gravestones for early settlers and family members. Most of the stones are unmarked, which is typical for early African American cemeteries.

===Travilah Oak===
The Travilah Oak, a white oak tree estimated to be 275 to 300 years old, is located at the intersection of Travilah and Glen roads in Maryland. In 2006, the tree was listed as having a height of , a crown spread of approximately , and a circumference of . A small park, open to the public, surrounds the huge tree. The crossroads was once the community of Travilah, and consisted of a general store, a town hall, a few homes, and a church.

===Travilah Town Hall===
The Travilah Town Hall was built around 1910, and the building was used for meetings and entertainment. The corporation formed to construct the building defaulted on its mortgage in 1918, and it became privately owned although it continued to be used for community purposes. Although the building has historical significance, it is currently privately–owned.
==Culture, recreation, and wildlife==
Travilah has been called one of the best places to live in Maryland by multiple sources. In addition to its highly rated schools, proximity to desirable workplaces, tranquility, and history, it has numerous parks and a museum. Glenstone Modern Art Museum is located in Travilah on Glen Road not far from the historic Travilah crossroads at the intersection of Travilah Road and Glen Road. It is a private art museum owned by a couple considered &quot;among the world&#x27;s top art collectors&quot;. Visitors are admitted every 30 minutes and therefore should have reservations.

<text>Washington Grove is a town in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. The population was 505 at the 2020 census. The Washington Grove Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

== History ==

=== Indigenous people of Washington Grove environs ===
The land where the residential community of Washington Grove now stands, and all of Montgomery County, was traveled and inhabited by indigenous people from around 10,000 BCE. Members of the Massawomeck, Susquehannock, Senaca (Iroquois), and Piscataway-Conoy tribes lived in the area, primarily using the land as crossover territory toward rock shelters, encampments and sizable villages near the Potomac River. Tribal boundaries were fluid.

=== Founding ===
A group of Methodists began the tradition of having camp meetings in the area &quot;circa&quot; 1800. Camp meetings were a tradition where a group of Methodists would gather in a forest clearing to worship and socialize. Benches were arranged in a circle or oval with an elevated preachers&#x27; stand in the middle. Tents surrounded the area, along with carriages and wagons behind them. Services lasted well into the night. The camp meetings provided cultural and spiritual improvement to those who attended.

In 1873, a committee from the Foundry Methodist Church, located at 14th and G streets NW in Washington, D.C., began a search for a permanent location to hold annual camp meetings. They wanted a location with sufficient space for thousands of attendees, a supply of clean water, and a shaded location to provide relief from the summer sun. They wanted the location to be less than a day&#x27;s trip from Washington, and protection from the sale of liquor, because Methodists did not believe in drinking alcohol.

In June 1873, John T. Mitchell, Richard Willett, F. Howard, W.R. Woodward, E.F. Simpson, Mr. Worthington, Thomas P. Morgan, B. Peyton Brown, and a few others purchased of land from the widow of farmer Nathan Cooke for $6,636.25. The land was given to the Washington Grove Meeting Association, which had been recently incorporated on March 30, 1874.

A person could build a cottage on the land by purchasing five shares of stock for twenty dollars per share. The first share had to be purchased with cash, while the other four could be financed at an annual interest rate of six percent. Alternatively, a tent could be rented for between $9 and $15. There were two dining courts, and a market would provided fresh meat and produce. The center of the camp was originally named The Plaza and later The Symbolic Circle, and there were six numbered avenues radiating from it. Tents were arranged in a grid along avenues named for participating churches. Families would stay over to attend a two-week-long meeting of the Methodist Episcopal churches of the District of Columbia. Named Washington Grove Camp, the first camp meeting began on August 5, 1874, with 240 tents.

In 1877, a tabernacle with a belfry for a bell was built in the center of the circle. The bell called people to prayer, and it was also rung at the end of the camp meeting. The tabernacle was a large open-air chapel that could seat 500 worshipers. In addition to religious services, lecturers spoke on such topics as women&#x27;s suffrage and the problem of poverty in cities.

The Maryland legislature gave camp-meeting managers control of all land within a two-mile radius of a meeting site in order to prohibit businesses from opening nearby. The camp-meeting managers used this power to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages anywhere on the grounds. While entertaining programs were allowed, card playing, theater going, and dancing were all banned. In 1879, they voted to prohibit the selling of anything at all on Sundays. The Barrett Brothers, who operated the camp store, asked for an exception to sell ice cream and sandwiches on Sundays, but their request was denied.

Reverend William Burns of Dumbarton Methodist Church built the first cottage in 1878. By 1879, seventeen cottages had been built, each with green and white exteriors and large porches, surrounding a large tabernacle. The cottages peaked roofs resembled that of the original tents, and the architectural style was Carpenter Gothic, which was fashionable at the time. The round-trip train fare between the District and Washington Grove was eighty cents in 1879.

In 1879, the trustees voted to borrow $4,000 in order to build a hotel on the western area of the grounds. Completed in 1881, the hotel was three stories in the center and two stories in the wings. It had 23 sleeping rooms, a parlor, a dining room, and a kitchen. The cost to build the hotel came in under the $4,000 budget. Building of a chapel to hold 800 people began in 1889.

In 1880, the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association decided that a hotel was needed. To build the hotel, they chose Wash Williams, a furniture store owner. The Albany Hotel had big porches, a large dining room, a barber shop, and a small store. Rooms cost between $6 and $7 per week, and dinner cost fifty cents. During the same year, rules were established protecting existing trees when cottages and streets were built.

In order to accommodate larger groups of people, an auditorium with seating for 1,400 people was built in Woodward Park in 1905. The auditorium symbolically moved away from the Sacred Circle. Admission to the wholesome entertainment cost $2 per adult and $1 per child for the season. Some of the entertainment included musical programs, educational lectures, and spelling bees. Religious services were held at the auditorium as well. As the auditorium increasingly became the center of life at the camp, the old Tabernacle was torn down.

Because the land was owned by the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association, it had complete control over who purchased and leased the plots. In the early 20th century, the Washington Grove Camp Association, and later the Town of Washington Grove, placed restrictive covenants in deeds and leases in order to prevent African Americans from buying, renting, or leasing land in Washington Grove. This is exemplified in one of many deeds, such as one dating from 1925 that reads,

That whereas the death rate of persons of African descent is much greater than the death rate of persons of the white race and affects injuriously the health of the town and village communities, and as the permanent location of persons of African descent in such places as owners or tenants constitutes and irreparable injury to the value and usefulness of real estate in the interest of public health and to prevent irreparable injury to the grantor or its successors and assigns, and the owners of adjacent real estate, the grantees, their heirs and assigns, hereby covenant, and agree with the grantor, its successors and assigns, that they will not sell, conveyor rent the premises hereby conveyed, the whole or any part thereof, or any structure thereon, to any person of African descent.

A Black Methodist camp was founded in 1864 as Emory Grove, that predated Washington Grove. Less than a mile separated the two towns, and many of the residents of Emory Grove worked for the residents of Washington Grove. The superintendent of the Washington Grove grounds was a resident of Emory Grove named William A. Scott. Following an incident in 1892 where an Emory Grove native, Jessie Lancaster, ransacked homes in Washington Grove, William A. Scott was forced out. Subsequently, in 1897 the gates to Washington Grove were closed, thus preventing anyone from walking through Washington Grove. This closing severely hindered the ability of Emory Grove residents to reach the train stop on the other side of Washington Grove.

=== Twentieth century ===
Eventually, people began to live in the area year-round. In 1910, the church formed a year-round congregation. By the 1920s, the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association began selling portions of land, slowly replacing the 99-year leases. By 1924, camp meetings were no longer held.

The Great Depression affected the area significantly. The Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association had a difficult time paying its bills, it cut back on its insurance, and at one point it needed a donation to pay the community&#x27;s electricity bill. Because some residents could no longer afford vacation homes, some of the homes were rented out while others stood vacant and neglected.

By 1934, the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association recognized that the area had dramatically changed since its founding. Some residents wanted the area to be annexed to the town of Gaithersburg. Reorganization committees met for several years to determine a plan for the future of the community. In 1937, the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association was dissolved; the Maryland Legislature incorporated the community as a town on March 26, 1937. Maryland Governor Harry Nice signed the town&#x27;s charter into law on May 18, 1937. On July 10, 1937, the town held an election where it chose its first mayor and six members of the town council. Irving L. McCathran was elected the town&#x27;s first mayor. He served as mayor for twenty years.

By the late 1940s, Washington Grove began to look run down. Assembly Hall was in poor condition, the parks were unkempt, and many cottages so dilapidated that they were torn down. There was too little money to maintain the Auditorium, and it was demolished. The surrounding farms in Gaithersburg were beginning to be sold to developers, changing the surrounding area and putting pressure on the town to change dramatically. In 1955, the Town of Washington Grove obtained zoning and planning powers in order to control future growth.

In 1975, a master plan was written in order to retain the existing historic nature of the town. The town applied for National Register of Historic Places status in 1979, and it was approved the following year.

=== Today ===
The original layout of small houses fronting grassy walkways was preserved in the center of town, with vehicular access via paved streets leading to the backs of the houses. Houses built more recently do not front the walkways, but preserve a Grove flavor by the variety of architectural styles resulting from their being constructed one at a time in various styles rather than in tracts.

More than half of the town is publicly owned. The East Woods and West Woods, designated as wildlife sanctuaries, are the only municipality-owned forests in Maryland. The many walkways and parks are popular not only with residents but also with people from neighboring communities. On a fine evening, the walkways hum with people and cats strolling, walking dogs, and chatting. Residents meet for musical picnics at the Gazebo, town meetings in McCathran Hall, and summer days swimming in Maple Lake, the Town&#x27;s swimming hole in the West Woods. Other town activities include the Summer in the Parks program for children, a book club, a movie club, and the Mousetrap series of concerts.

In 2013, Preservation Maryland placed Washington Grove on its list of threatened historic properties.

Two council meetings are held each month. Town residents are encouraged to attend, and in one of the two monthly meetings a period of time is set aside for &quot;Public Appearances&quot; in which issues are aired and discussed by town residents urging some action by the council. There is a town meeting yearly in which town residents examine and approve (or ask for changes to) the coming fiscal year&#x27;s budget. When issues of significant importance are pending, a special town meeting is often called to allow for an exchange of ideas.

Most of the work in keeping the town running, however, is performed by volunteers in committees including the Woods Group, the Recreation Committee, the Lake Committee, the Historic Preservation Committee, and many others. Volunteerism is high, allowing an extraordinarily broad range of activities and events.

Each councilor is liaison to (typically) two town committees, with responsibilities to attend meetings of those committees and report back on their activities. Individual councilors are also responsible for administration of contracts for road maintenance, trash and recycling pickup, tree maintenance, and other ongoing upkeep efforts.

==Education==

Zoned schools include:
* Washington Grove Elementary School
* Forest Oak Middle School

<text>White Oak is a census-designated place and unincorporated area in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. It had a population of 16,347 in 2020.

White Oak was known for its Naval Ordnance Laboratory, which was closed in 1994. The headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration now occupies the property, which has been renamed the Federal Research Center at White Oak. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the locality has a total area of square miles ( km), all land.

White Oak is a diverse neighborhood. The main area of White Oak is from Lockwood Drive starting from New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650) towards Stewart Lane, crossing Columbia Pike (U.S. 29).

==Geography==
As an unincorporated area, White Oak&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined by either a municipal government or by the government of Montgomery County. Boundaries for the White Oak census-designated place have been established by the United States Census Bureau, while the United States Geological Survey recognizes White Oak to be a populated place located at (39.039832, –76.993032). Many of its residents consider themselves to be residents of the White Oak neighborhood of Silver Spring, similar to how large cities have different neighborhoods within their borders.

==Quaint Acres==
&quot;Quaint Acres&quot; is a subdivision of White Oak just north of modern Route 29 and west of New Hampshire Avenue. The subdivision was named after the house of Altus Lacy Quaintance, a State Entomologist of Maryland who worked at the Maryland Agricultural College and later at the USDA.

On 26 May 1945, a TB-25D &#x27;Mitchell&#x27; bomber en route from Biloxi to Bolling Field crashed near Quaint Acres, killing all four aboard. The bomber was piloted by Dudley M. Outcalt who flew in the 94th Aero Squadron during World War I.

After the war, the Quaint Acres subdivision was home to famed naturalist Rachel Carson and where she wrote &quot;Silent Spring&quot; in 1962, the book that facilitated the ban of the pesticide DDT in the United States. She built the ranch house at 11701 Berwick Rd. in 1956, and lived there until her death in 1964. The house is a National Historic Landmark, but not open to the public.

Quaint Acres was also the Washington area home to Margaret Chase Smith, the first woman to be elected to both the U.S. House and the Senate.

Southeast Hebrew was originally founded by Orthodox Eastern European immigrants in 1909 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Many Jews began to move out of Southeast Washington beginning in the 1930s and Southeast Hebrew was relocated to White Oak in 1971. Between 1965 and 2011, White Oak was home to Shaare Tefila Congregation, a Conservative synagogue. Shaare Tefila was originally founded in Riggs Park, a historically Jewish neighborhood in Washington, D.C., once known as DC&#x27;s &quot;Little Tel Aviv.&quot; Founded in 1951, Shaare Tefila was relocated to White Oak in 1965. In 2011, Shaare Tefila was relocated again, moving to Olney where many young members now reside.

<text>Accokeek (), &quot;at the edge of the hill&quot; in Algonquin, is a census-designated place (CDP) located in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The CDP is located on the Potomac River, borders Charles County and is approximately 17 miles from Washington. It is a part of the Washington metropolitan area. The population of the CDP, as of the 2020 United States Census was 13,927.

While the area around Accokeek was inhabited by Native Americans since approximately 2,000 BCE, John Smith was the first European to visit the area in 1608. In 1990, the United States Census Bureau officially made Accokeek a CDP.

== History ==
The area around Accokeek had been occupied since around 2000 BC; however, the first permanent village was established in 1200 AD by the Piscataway tribe. Captain John Smith was the first European to see the Accokeek area. In 1608, he sailed the Potomac River and found the Moyaone village. At the time of the discovery, Moyaone was the seat of government for the Piscataway Tribe. The village of Moyaone disbanded and the population migrated to other tribes before other Europeans settled the area.

In the mid-17th century, settlers were purchasing large plots of land for farming. The Native Americans were upset that the settlers were wearing-out the land due to farming various crops, which led to multiple battles between the two. Between 1675 and 1682, the Native Americans were forced from the area as a result of losing.

In 1861, Accokeek was still rural, and agriculture was the main economic factor for the place. Tobacco was the main crop planted. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Accokeek sympathized with the Confederacy. According to the 1860 Census, the area around Accokeek had a slave population of 1,600 (52.6%). There were multiple Confederate spies in the area, including Thomas Harbin who opened a hotel in the area and had plans to kidnap then-President Abraham Lincoln.

Henry and Alice Ferguson settled in Accokeek when they purchased Hard Bargain Farm overlooking the Potomac River in 1922 as a vacation retreat. Between 1935 and 1939 Alice Ferguson initiated archaeological excavations. A fort from the Susquehannock people, which was demolished in 1675, was found. In 1957, US Senator Frances P. Bolton founded the Accokeek Foundation. The Foundation was used to purchase of land in Piscataway Park to help preserve the area. Much of the community west of Route 210 is designated the Moyaone Reserve and contains mid-century, individually-designed homes on minimum 5-acre wooded lots. Community educational attractions include Hard Bargain Farm (Ferguson Foundation) and the National Colonial Farm (National Park Service), which are listed below under &quot;Parks and Recreation.&quot; Both these sites have numerous special events, including an annual Oktoberfest, and a &quot;theater in the woods&quot;. In 1960, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) wanted to build a water treatment plant in Mockley Point, which was Accokeek shoreline. Since it would disrupt the view of Mount Vernon and Fort Washington Park, various people and organizations protested against it. In 1961, a law was signed by President John F. Kennedy in order to designate around Mockley Point as a national landmark. Both the Accokeek Foundation and the Alice Ferguson Foundation donated another to the landmark. As a result, WSSC was not allowed to build the plant there; however, a plant was built in the 1960s in the surrounding area.

In 1990, Accokeek officially became a CDP when the US Census Bureau defined the place&#x27;s boundaries. In 2008, eight people were killed and 9 more were injured in Accokeek on Indian Head Highway in an illegal street race.

=== Primary and secondary schools ===

Accokeek is under the Prince George&#x27;s County Public Schools district.

It has one public school, Accokeek Academy, which serves all of the CDP for elementary and middle school. It was formed in 2009 by the merger of Henry G. Ferguson Elementary School, built in 1963, and Eugene Burroughs Middle School, built in 1966. The newly merged school retained separate elementary and middle school campuses. In 2010 the school had a total of 1,178 students, with 553 at the elementary campus and 625 at the middle school campus. In 2011 the elementary school population had increased to 570. In a period after 2011 the fifth grade was moved to the middle school complex for two reasons: The first was so Burroughs middle school could have a higher occupancy rate, giving it eligibility for renovation funds from the State of Maryland. The second was to alleviate overcrowding in the original elementary building, which had a capacity of about 410 students; the middle school building had a capacity of 805 students.

Even though initially some parents advocated for having a single combined PK-8 building, the district instead chose to rebuild the elementary building; a study from 2008 had described the elementary building as having one of the poorest states of repair in the PGCPS system. The school planned to construct a more than , two-story facility. After the scheduled completion of the new elementary building in August 2013, the district planned to temporarily house the middle school students there while the middle school building is renovated, and in 2014 put the students in their respective permanent buildings. In addition PGCPS planned to establish a walkway between the two buildings. The State of Maryland was to spend over $7 million while PGCPS was to spend fewer than $19 million, so the total cost was over $26 million.

All of the CDP is zoned to Gwynn Park High School, located in Brandywine CDP. There is also a private school, Accokeek College Preparatory School, the secondary school campus of The Beddow Schools.

From 1950 to 1964, during the era of legally-required racial segregation of schools, black students from Accokeek attended Fairmont Heights High School, then near Fairmount Heights.

<text>Adelphi is an unincorporated area and census-designated place in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. Per the 2020 Census, the population was 16,823. Adelphi includes the following subdivisions; Adelphi, Adelphi Park, Adelphi Hills, Adelphi Terrace, Adelphi Village, Buck Lodge, Chatham, Cool Spring Terrace, Hillandale Forest, Holly Hill Manor, Knollwood, Lewisdale, and White Oak Manor.

==History==
The unincorporated Adelphi community takes its name from the historic Adelphi Mill, established in 1796 along the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River. and continues to attract visitors and can be rented for special functions. During the 19th century, George Washington Riggs acquired much of the area northeast of Washington, D.C., as his Green Hill estate in the Chillum Manor district. That estate included present-day Adelphi. In the early 1920s, part of the area was acquired by Leander McCormick-Goodhart as part of his Langley Park estate. Labor organizer Mary Harris &quot;Mother&quot; Jones died in 1930, at the farm of Walter and Lillie May Burgess near Powder Mill and Riggs Roads in present-day Adelphi. A marker was erected by the Maryland State Highway Administration commemorating Mother Jones at her death site. Unlike its nearby neighbors Hyattsville and College Park, the area remained relatively undeveloped until immediately following World War II. At that time, subdivisions quickly developed.

To distinguish it from the other neighboring unincorporated communities of Lewisdale and Langley Park, the growing subdivisions banded together in the mid-1950s and adopted the name &quot;Adelphi&quot; to reflect their commitment to the preservation of the historic mill of the same name. A community focal point that originally developed in the late 1950s is the Adelphi Pool, a private pool in the Adelphi neighborhood, located next to George Washington Cemetery on Riggs Road.

Use of the Adelphi Pool requires paid membership or being accompanied by a member and paying a small fee. The Adelphi pool offers swimming lessons and also features swim teams which compete against each other. Two notable features of the Adelphi Pool are its long water slide and basketball hoop.

In 1971, the Harry Diamond Laboratories was established on in the northern part of Adelphi. That facility continues as the Adelphi Laboratory Center, Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the U.S. Army&#x27;s corporate research laboratory. Other adjacent federal facilities include the National Archives at College Park and headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration.

==History==

Beltsville&#x27;s history dates back to 1649, when the land was part of an land grant given to Richard Snowden I by Lord Baltimore of England. Snowden and his family were planters who established large plantations on which they built comfortable manor homes. Soon after, other settlers moved into the area, but they were farmers who could only afford a few acres of land and whose families lived in small cabins. The principal crop was tobacco, most of which was shipped to England. Because of the fertile soil and desirable growing conditions, the crops prospered.

Industry came to Beltsville in the early 18th century when iron ore was discovered in the area. The Muirkirk Iron Furnace on US 1 was established by Andrew and Elias Elliott, who learned their iron-making skills in Muirkirk, Scotland. They produced some of the best-quality pig iron in the country and supplied the U.S. Army with cannons, shot, wheels, and other iron products during the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.

By 1730, Post Road (now part of US 1) was the main thoroughfare through Beltsville. Though crude, it made stagecoach travel possible. In 1783, Gabriel Peterson Van Horn established a stage line and built the Van Horn Tavern on Odell Road, where passengers could spend the night as they traveled between Baltimore and Washington. The trip took one and one-half days.

Beltsville has a distinguished Revolutionary War hero as its native son. Brigadier General Rezin Beall, who was born on Turkey Flight Plantation on Old Gunpowder Road in 1723, prevented a British invasion at Drum Point on the Chesapeake Bay with only 100 men. He is credited with the fact that there are no Revolutionary War battlefields in Maryland.

In 1835 one of the first rail lines in the country, the Washington branch of the B&amp;O Railroad (Baltimore &amp; Ohio), was built through Prince George&#x27;s County. Coming from Baltimore, the line entered the county at Laurel and ran southwesterly to Bladensburg, then into Washington. B&amp;O established a rail stop and freight depot on land purchased from a tobacco farmer named Trueman Belt, and they named the place after him. The new community of Beltsville was doubly blessed, for the Baltimore-Washington Turnpike crossed the rail line there. It soon became a thriving little trading center, eclipsing the older community of Vansville further north on the pike.

The original area developed haphazardly and consisted of a few residences, two churches, several small stores, a blacksmith, and a wheelwright. In 1891, the Beltsville Land Improvement Company was chartered and over the next thirty years developed the South Beltsville subdivision as a grid of streets. The developers sold the lots to individual owners and placed restrictive covenants on the deeds, including forbidding the manufacture or sale of alcohol and the sale of any property to an African American. Beltsville was marketed to professionals who wanted to escape the congestion of Washington and was developed with a mixture of Victorian-style houses and Colonial Revival houses. The community grew further when an electric railway was extended to Beltsville. The railway began as the Berwyn and Laurel Electric Railroad, but after suffering from financial difficulties it was acquired by the City and Suburban Railway. Located to the west of the railroad, along the line of present-day Rhode Island Avenue, the streetcar line served as the nucleus for additional subdivisions. These areas continued to develop slowly throughout the 1930s and 1940s with the construction of modest side-gable residences. Development continued after the introduction of the automobile, but it was not until after World War II that intensive development came to the Beltsville area.

As the federal government grew, in 1910 the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) began to purchase land in Beltsville for its Agricultural Research Service, the main in-house research arm of the USDA. The land now houses the Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC). The first parcel acquired was of the Walnut Grange Plantation with its historic &quot;Butterfly House&quot;. The Center eventually encompassed and became the largest and most prominent center of agricultural science research in the world.

There are a number of historic homes and buildings still standing in Beltsville. The oldest home was built in 1773. One of the largest of the older buildings, built in 1880, was the three-story Ammendale Normal Institute, which was destroyed by fire in 1998.

In 2003 Kevin Kennedy started a group which aimed to have Beltsville incorporate into its own municipality. By 2004 the 12-member group, named Committee to Incorporate Beltsville, advocated for getting the issue on the ballot. By late 2004 the group began efforts to collect 3,000 signatures on a petition so the issue can be put up for election; this would represent about one quarter of the persons in Beltsville who were registered to vote. By the deadline in March 2005 they failed to get sufficient signatures as they only had 2,000.

===Taxation===
At 53 cents per $100 per assessed value, Berwyn Heights has one of the lower real property tax rates in Prince George&#x27;s County. In 2005, the town became the first municipality in Maryland to establish a public safety taxing district, after it was authorized by the general assembly. The district imposes a special tax on businesses to fund the cost of one full-time officer and helps maintain around the clock police coverage.

===County government===
Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department District 1 Station in Hyattsville serves Berwyn Heights.

==Civic activities==
The town also benefits from numerous town committees and organizations. The town, as of October 2008, has joined a State Retirement Pension, for its employees, and police officers. This was done in order to try to compete and to retain the police officers.

Sports Park, which is the home of a Berwyn Heights civic group, is located by Indian Creek.

Berwyn Heights Day is a yearly event that celebrates the founding of the town.

<text>Bladensburg is a town in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The population was 9,657 at the 2020 census. Areas in Bladensburg are located within ZIP code 20710. Bladensburg is from Washington, D.C.

== History ==
Originally called Garrison&#x27;s Landing, Bladensburg was renamed in honor of Thomas Bladen, governor of Maryland, 1742–1747. Bladensburg was established in 1742 as a regional commercial center by an act of the Maryland General Assembly. The act also authorized the town commissioners to purchase of land to be laid out in lots. The act required that a house covering at least of ground with a brick or stone chimney be constructed within 18 months of the sale of the lot. As of June 6, 1746, only 18 of the lots had been improved according to the stipulations of the act. Christopher Lowndes&#x27; house, Bostwick, and those built by David Ross and William Hilleary (the William Hilleary House) were among them.

===Port, war, and railroad (1740s–1830s)===
With the establishment in 1747 of a government tobacco inspection system, Bladensburg became a designated tobacco inspection and grading port. The Market Master&#x27;s House is evidence of that role. The town was a seaport during the colonial period.

Bladensburg is best remembered for the Battle of Bladensburg (1814) during the War of 1812, the only battle in US history in which a sitting president (James Madison) rode into battle. US defeat in that battle, called &quot;the greatest disgrace ever dealt to American arms&quot;, cleared the way for the burning of Washington by British troops.

Its role as a seaport faded as the Anacostia River silted up and larger ships could no longer reach the port. However, the town remained an important crossroads of routes north to Baltimore and Philadelphia, south and east to the towns of Annapolis and Upper Marlboro, and west to the District of Columbia. The original terminus of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was Bladensburg, forcing all passengers intended for Washington to board carriages to continue on into the city. A sharp decline of passengers was experienced in Bladensburg when an extension of the B&amp;O was permitted into the District of Columbia in 1835.

===1840s–present===
Bladensburg remained a small town throughout the rest of the 19th century with modest development and infrastructure improvements. A major attraction in Bladensburg from the 18th century through the 20th century was the Spa Springs. Thought to be a cure for various illnesses, the springs attracted visitors from throughout the region and was reachable by the Washington, Spa Spring and Gretta Railroad. Another attraction was the Bladensburg Dueling Grounds or Dueling Creek, the site of many famous duels until after the American Civil War.
The town was incorporated in 1854. Schools and churches were constructed, including the first Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau school for African Americans in 1866. The town experienced its most significant growth in the early 20th century with the construction of the first two residential sections of the town in 1914 and 1917. Named Decatur Heights, the subdivisions had gridded streets platted on the north and south sides of Annapolis Road. The town was enlarged again in 1947 by the Sunnybrook subdivision. The mid to late 20th century brought additional residential construction in the form of single-family houses and apartment complexes, as well as the construction of the Bladensburg Shopping Center. After a history major flooding, the Army Corps of Engineers implemented a flood control system around this time that altered the course of the Anacostia River and added levees.

In 1999, Bladensburg, Colmar Manor, and Cottage City were lauded by the Joint Center for Sustainable Communities for their collaboration with Prince George&#x27;s County for the Port Towns Revitalization Initiative, which created a common &quot;Port Towns&quot; identity for the towns; encouraged businesses development through infrastructure and façade improvements; acquisition of historic properties and plans for their reuse; and reconstruction of the Bladensburg waterfront and marina.

<text>Bowie () is a city in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 58,329. Bowie has grown from a small railroad stop to the largest municipality in Prince George&#x27;s County, and the fifth most populous city and third largest city by area in the U.S. state of Maryland. In 2014, CNN Money ranked Bowie 28th in its Best Places to Live (in the United States) list.

==History==

===19th century===
The city of Bowie owes its existence to the railway. In 1853, Colonel William Duckett Bowie obtained a charter from the Maryland legislature to construct a rail line into Southern Maryland. In 1869, the Baltimore &amp; Potomac Railroad Company began the construction of a railroad from Baltimore to Southern Maryland, terminating in Pope&#x27;s Creek. The area had already been dotted with small farms and large tobacco plantations in an economy based on agriculture and slavery. In 1870, Ben Plumb, a land speculator and developer, sold building lots around the railroad junction and named the settlement Huntington City. By 1872, the line was completed, together with a &quot;spur&quot; to Washington, D.C., and the entire line through Southern Maryland was completed in 1873.

In 1880, Huntington City was rechartered as Bowie, named for Colonel Bowie&#x27;s son and business partner Oden Bowie, the former Governor of Maryland and then-president of the Baltimore &amp; Potomac Railroad. In the early days the land was subdivided by developers into more than 500 residential building lots, to create a large town site at a junction of the Baltimore and Potomac&#x27;s main line to southern Maryland, and the branch line to Washington, D.C.

===20th century===

By 1902, the Baltimore &amp; Potomac was purchased by the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad. A second railroad entered the community when the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway electric trolley line commenced service in 1908. The large interurban cars brought rapid transit to the area, with trains running hourly. Bowie area stations included High Bridge, Hillmeade, and the Race Track.

The convergence of the two rail systems induced the Southern Maryland Agricultural Society to build the Bowie Race Track in 1914. The track enabled the Belair Stud to become one of Maryland&#x27;s premier areas for thoroughbreds. Also in 1914, a teacher-training college, or normal school as it was referred to then, was built for African-Americans, just outside the town. This now has become Bowie State University. The town of Bowie was incorporated in 1916.

====Belair at Bowie====
In 1957, the firm of Levitt and Sons acquired the nearby Belair Estate, the original colonial plantation of the Provincial Governor of Maryland, Samuel Ogle, and developed the residential community of Belair at Bowie. Two years later the town of Bowie annexed the Levitt properties and then re-incorporated the now-larger area as a city in 1963. The overwhelming majority of Bowie residents today live in this 1960s Levitt planned community, whose street names are arranged in alliterative sections. Levitt &amp; Sons had a long history of prohibiting the sale of houses (including resale by owners) to African Americans which led to protests during the Civil Rights Movement in Bowie in 1963.

====Belair Estate====
The original Belair Estate contains the Belair Mansion (circa 1745), the five-part Georgian plantation house of Governor Samuel Ogle and his son Governor Benjamin Ogle. It was purchased in 1898 by the wealthy banker James T. Woodward who, on his passing in 1910, left it to his nephew, William Woodward Sr., who became a famous horseman. Restored to reflect its 250-year-old legacy, the Mansion is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Belair Stable, on the Estate, was part of the famous Belair Stud, one of the premier racing stables in the 1930s, &#x27;40s, and &#x27;50s. Owned and operated by William Woodward Sr. (1876–1953), it closed in 1957 following the death of his son, Billy Woodward. Belair had been the oldest continually operating racing horse farm in the country.

===21st century===

Bowie has an area of and about 50,000 residents with nearly set aside as parks or open space. It has 72 ball fields, three community centers, an ice arena at Allen Pond Park, the Bowie Town Center, the 800-seat Bowie Center for the Performing Arts, a 150-seat theatrical playhouse, a golf course, and three museums.

Bowie&#x27;s rail town history is on display via the Huntington Railroad Museum, within the local rail station&#x27;s restored railroad buildings. In 2006, the city reopened the Bowie Building Association building, a small brick and block structure constructed circa 1930, as a Welcome Center; it originally housed the Bowie Building Association, which helped finance much of the community&#x27;s early development.

Bowie is home to the Chesapeake Baysox, a Minor League Baseball team of the Eastern League which serves as the Double-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. The Baysox moved to Bowie from Hagerstown in 1993 and began to play at Prince George&#x27;s Stadium in 1994. In 2015, the Baysox captured their first Eastern League championship, defeating the Reading Fightin Phils in five games.

The city operates a senior citizens center and a gymnasium for community programs.

==History==
William H. Early named the town of Brandywine as property he owned in the mid-19th century. The CDP consists of the property he owned in the 19th century. It is thought to be named after the Battle of Brandywine of the American Revolutionary War. Brandywine was developed on the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad&#x27;s Pope Creek (Southern Maryland) line in about 1873 and was the only town on the route that developed into a railroad town.

On September 1, 1877, around 4 p.m., a small 2.7 magnitude earthquake struck Brandywine.

In 1912, the Bank of Brandywine was chartered from what had previously been the Southern Maryland German-American Bank.

Although located between the substantial bedroom cities of Clinton and Waldorf, Brandywine remained rural until after the turn of the twenty-first century, when shopping centers—including big-box stores—and small residential developments were built. Despite the building of both a major highway overpass and a roundabout in 2019, the community is still notorious for traffic slowdowns due to both daily local commuters and interstate travelers. As of 2024, two new townhouse developments are under construction. 
=== Historical sites===

The community&#x27;s new Southern Area Aquatics and Recreational Complex offers services to residents of all ages.

==Government==
Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department District 5 Station in Clinton and District 7 Station in Fort Washington serve the community.

The U.S. Postal Service operates the Brandywine Post Office.

A United States Armed Forces communications receiving facility, known as the Brandywine Receiver Site, is located in Brandywine. It is associated with Joint Base Andrews.

<text>Brentwood is a town in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States.
Per the 2020 census, the population was 3,828. Brentwood is located within of Washington, D.C. The municipality of Brentwood is located just outside the northeast boundary of the District of Columbia and surrounded by the communities of Mount Rainier, Cottage City, North Brentwood, and the nearby Hyattsville. Along the Route 1 Corridor, Brentwood is part of the Gateway Arts District.

==History==
===19th century===
The town was originally incorporated in 1922 and is named after the Brentwood estate built in 1817 by Robert Brent in Northeast Washington, D.C. The town was developed beginning in the 1890s around the Highland Station of the Washington Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Columbia and Maryland Railway. Brentwood was created by Wallace A. Bartlett, a Civil War veteran, former foreman for the Government Printing Office, Patent Office examiner, and inventor originally from Warsaw, New York. Captain Bartlett lived in Washington, D.C., until 1887, when he purchased of farmland from Benjamin Holliday, which abutted the Highland subdivision. Bartlett built a farmhouse for his family on the land and, with two partners J. Lee Adams and Samuel J. Mills, formed the Holladay Land and Improvement Company. Captain Bartlett died in 1908.

In 1891, the Company platted a residential subdivision called &quot;Holladay Company&#x27;s Addition to Highland&quot; on of the Bartlett Farm. The lots were approximately by and were arranged around an irregular grid of streets. The lots in the northern part of the subdivision, which eventually would become North Brentwood, were smaller and were subject to flooding from a mill race. These lots were less expensive, and Bartlett encouraged their purchase by African-American families with whom he was indirectly associated from his command of U.S. Colored Troops in the Civil War. The more expensive lots to the south were purchased by white working-class families, many of whom were employed as federal government clerks. Seven additional houses were built by 1896. In 1899 Bartlett purchased the Fenwick family farm which was located to the west of the Holladay Company&#x27;s Addition to Highland. With two new partners, J. Baker and Dr. Sigmund A. Czarra, Bartlett began the Brentwood Company. The area was surveyed and platted in 1899. The Holladay Addition homes represented a typical cross-section of housing styles popular in the late-19th century, including I-houses, vernacular houses with Queen Anne detailing, four-squares, and front-gable houses.

===20th century===
The community continued to grow in the early 20th century. A school was built, and the Brentwood Citizens&#x27; Association formed in 1903, a Methodist church was constructed in 1904, a fire department was started in 1905, and was formed in 1903. Kerosene street lamps were added in 1917, and electric lights were installed in 1920. When incorporated, the town included the southerly part of the Holladay Addition, the Brentwood Company subdivision, and two smaller additions. The houses built during this time consisted of small frame bungalows. Growth continued through the 1940s and 1950s, fueled by an influx of government workers. In the 1950s, many older homes were replaced and empty lots were filled with small cottages and ranch-style houses.

The majority of homes in Brentwood were built during and after World War II; young people coming to Washington, D.C., to support the war effort found a quiet place to raise their families. There are two small service-oriented commercial areas. A focal point is Bartlett Park named for Captain Bartlett who deeded the land to the town. The park is home to the Wohlfarth Building, which serves as the Town Hall.

===21st century===
In 2024, Brentwood demolished its sundown town-era metal barrier erected in 1957 to separate the majority-white Brentwood from the historically Black town of North Brentwood.

<text>Camp Springs is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The population was 22,734 at the 2020 census. Camp Springs is not an official post office designation; the area is divided among the surrounding mailing addresses of Temple Hills, Fort Washington, Clinton, and Suitland.

==History==
The community of Camp Springs was settled in the mid-19th century at the crossroads of present-day Branch Avenue and Allentown Road. By 1860, the settlement contained several stores, a blacksmith shop, a school, Methodist church, and several residences. Early maps record the name of this settlement as Allentown, after the Allen family. The Allens were large landholders in the area, and the town, adjacent road, and Allenwood Elementary School were named in recognition of them. The town&#x27;s popular name, and subsequently the name of its post office, was Camp Springs. According to local history, the community was called Camp Springs since soldiers en route to Fort Meade from the District of Columbia found the area to be a comfortable place to camp due to the abundant springs.

Throughout the late- 19th and early 20th centuries, the Camp Springs area did not experience significant growth. However, the opening of Andrews AFB on an adjacent tract of land, the proximity of the area to the District of Columbia, and a housing shortage after World War II made the Camp Springs area an ideal location for residential development.

Most of the development in the Camp Springs area occurred north of the Camp Springs crossroads in the 1940s and 1950s. The lack of water and sewer lines in most locations until the late 1950s and early 1960s kept the pace of development slow. The largest development in the 1940s was the subdivision of the Middleton farm north of Camp Springs. This farm was platted into Glenn Hills, Middleton Farm, and Middleton Valley. Guy Trueman built one of his many subdivisions in the mid-1940s by platting Trueman Heights on over in the northwest quadrant of the Camp Springs crossroads. Modest single-family houses were constructed along a fragmented grid of streets. Residential development during the 1950s primarily took the form of infill construction within subdivisions platted in the 1940s. One of the exceptions is the large Westchester Estates development located in the southwest quadrant of the Camp Springs crossroads. The over 400 houses were constructed along a curvilinear network of streets. Commercial development, consisting of shopping centers, restaurants, and hotels, extends along Allentown Road east of Branch Avenue. The largest boom of construction occurred in the 1960s and 1970s after the completion of water and sewer lines and the construction of the Capital Beltway. Pyles Lumber Company, a historic lumber business at the crossroads, was destroyed by fire on December 27, 2000. The 19th century crossroads vanished during the 20th century with the reconstruction of Branch Avenue into a limited-access divided highway, and extensive commercial and residential development.

==Geography==
Camp Springs is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.19%, is water.

Joint Base Andrews, home base of the Air Force Systems Command and the official presidential airplane &quot;Air Force One&quot;, is adjacent to Camp Springs, and the base in particular, along with federal jobs in Washington, D.C., were major reasons for the community&#x27;s original development. The Capital Beltway passes through the area, and the Washington Metro Branch Avenue station, southern terminus of the Green Line, is located nearby. The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission operates a year-round indoor and outdoor public swimming pool on Allentown Road. The Camp Springs Senior Activity Center is housed in the former Camp Springs Elementary School. From the Heart Church Ministries has an average weekly attendance of 7,000 worshippers.

==History==

In 1904, Washington, D.C., was growing by leaps and bounds. The overcrowding and the improved public transportation made the idea of living on the outskirts increasingly appealing to people looking for housing. Recognizing the opportunity, Baltimore resident Otway B. Zantzinger acquired 400 hilly acres just beyond the eastern corner of the District of Columbia. He divided the tract into 4,000 lots and began to sell them at prices ranging from $20 to $150 each. He advertised a picturesque view of Washington, D.C., a proposed electric railway, drinking water from crystal-clear springs, nothing down and a dollar a month, no interest, no landlords, and, in the custom and vernacular of the times, &quot;no colored people.&quot; Many buyers bought two lots in this haven that was to become Capitol Heights.

While awaiting their &quot;proposed electric railway,&quot; commuters to the city could walk about a mile (often through mud) to the District Line station at what is now Seat Pleasant and board a rail car into Washington, DC.

The absence of paved roads, sidewalks, street lights, and other public services, including the electric railway, began to cast a pall over Zantzinger&#x27;s vision of bliss. In 1910, the approximately 200 householders voted to incorporate their community as Capitol Heights. Over the next 50 years, the town made strides in improving its infrastructure and services. It established its own fire department and public works department and built facilities to house them and other elements of the government. By the 1970s, when its population had reached about 3,800, the town&#x27;s central business district had started to decline.

In 1980, that long-promised &quot;electric railway&quot; finally arrived. Capitol Heights got its own station on the Washington Metro Blue Line, providing easy access to the entire metropolitan region and national transportation facilities. The land around the station has been declared an Enterprise Zone, which the town is promoting as one of its paths to restoring prosperity. Today, over 90% of the population of Capitol Heights is African American and the town has had four African-American mayors.

<text>Cheverly is a town in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, located very close to Washington, D.C., though not bordering it directly. The town was founded in 1918 and incorporated in 1931. Per the 2020 census, the population was 6,170. Cheverly borders the communities of Tuxedo, Chapel Oaks, Landover, Landover Hills, Villa Heights, and Bladensburg.

Cheverly is home to the Prince George&#x27;s County Health Department, Cheverly Professional Building, PepsiCo bottling plant, Judith P Hoyer Early Childhood Center, Cheverly American Legion, Magruder Spring Historic Landmark, ABC Supply Company Inc., Washington Woodworking Company, Cheverly Sport Fair Fishing Store, and Publick Playhouse Theater.

Until 2021, Cheverly had been home to the University of Maryland Prince George’s Hospital Center, which was founded in 1944 and was known as a first-class trauma center. The facility closed on June 12, 2021, replaced by the all-new, $543 million University of Maryland Capital Region Medical Center, which opened the same day in nearby Largo.

==History==
===20th century===
Cheverly was begun as a planned suburb in the early 1900s. The Cheverly area was first platted in 1904 for a community called Cheverly Gardens. The land was subsequently purchased in 1918 by Robert Marshall, president of the Washington Suburban Realty Company. The Cheverly subdivision platted by Marshall was developed around the 1839 Magruder family homestead known as Mount Hope. Marshall became the first resident of Cheverly by taking up residence in the restored homestead in 1919. In 1923, the first road, now known as Cheverly Avenue, was completed and paved to connect the Pennsylvania Railroad line to Landover Road. Thirty-four developer-built houses were constructed between 1921 and 1925. Most of the early houses were mail-order homes from Sears &amp; Roebuck and the McClure Homes Company. Marshall lost control of the Washington Suburban Realty Company in 1927. Harry Wardman assumed the position until the company’s bankruptcy in 1929 due to the stock market crash.

Incorporation was granted in 1931 to address concerns for better roads and services. During the 1930s and 1940s, the streets were improved and lighting enhanced, and the number of residences increased from 135 to 650. Residential construction continued through the 1960s, creating a varied housing stock of early Cape Cod houses, with later ranch and split-level types. Two garden-style apartment complexes (Cheverly Terrace and Hanson Arms) were constructed in the early 1960s along Landover Road near the U.S. Route 50 interchange. The community center, town hall, and park facility was built in 1978. Industrial property was established in 1958 on the west side of town and adjacent to Route 50.

===21st century===
On April 29, 2006, the community held a 75th anniversary celebration at the town community center. The historic home Mount Hope had been the town&#x27;s official symbol since 1931, however, on June 11, 2020, the Mayor and Council voted unanimously to remove the home from the Town Seal and redesign it.

<text>Chillum is an unincorporated area and census-designated place in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, bordering Washington, D.C., and Montgomery County.

In addition to being its own unincorporated neighborhood, Chillum is also a census-designated place covering a larger area than the Chillum neighborhood. As of the 2010 census, the Chillum CDP included Chillum, as well as the adjacent unincorporated communities of Avondale, Carole Highlands, Green Meadows, and Lewisdale. The population was 36,039 at the 2020 census.

Chillum, the neighborhood, is contained between the Northwest Branch Anacostia River to the east, East West Highway (MD 410) and the Sligo Creek River to the north, New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650) to the west, and Eastern Avenue NE to the south. Chillum borders the adjacent communities of Avondale, Green Meadows, and Carole Highlands in Prince George&#x27;s County as well as the city of Takoma Park in Montgomery County, and the Riggs Park (also known as, &quot;Lamond Riggs&quot;), Queens Chapel, and North Michigan Park neighborhoods of Northeast Washington D.C. Actor Jonathan Banks is from Chillum.

==Geography==
Chillum is located at (38.968210, −76.979046).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.94%, is water. Chillum is unincorporated and does not have its own zipcode; therefore it relies on its neighboring city of Hyattsville for its postal addresses/ zipcodes. While a vast majority of the residents living in/ businesses located in Chillum, MD are assigned the Hyattsville postal zipcodes of either 20782, or 20783, there are a few residents living on the far west side of Chillum/ businesses located very close to New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650) and the Prince George&#x27;s/ Montgomery County Line, bordering the city of Takoma Park, MD, are assigned the Takoma Park, MD zipcode of 20912. Residents of Chillum that are assigned Takoma Park&#x27;s 20912 zipcode have Takoma Park addresses though they are not even located within Takoma Park&#x27;s boundaries. All of the other residents living in / businesses located in Chillum, have Hyattsville addresses.

==History==
Chillum takes its name from &quot;Chillum Castle Manor,&quot; the land patent established in 1763, by William Dudley Digges. It included lands in the present-day District of Columbia and in Prince George&#x27;s County, and was composed of previously established land patents such as Henrietta Maria, Widows Purchase, Yarrow and Yarrow Head. Chillum Castle Manor was named after Chilham Castle, the old home of Sir Dudley Digges, an ancestor of William Dudley Digges, in Kent, England.

The manor house for the Henrietta Maria parcel was named Green Hill. It was home to William Dudley Digges and was the place where Pierre L&#x27;Enfant, designer of nearby Washington, D.C., died in destitution in 1825. He remained buried at the Green Hill property until being re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery in 1909. The Green Hill plantation was subsequently purchased by George Washington Riggs, who built the present Green Hill historic home in 1868.

Since this area was not served by public transportation, such as a streetcar, Chillum remained rural in character into the 1930s. Beginning in the mid-1930s, the area of Chillum that is close to the District of Columbia border was subdivided into lots. Developers promoted the area’s convenient access into the city as well as its water, gas, and electricity supply. The first platted developments in the late 1930s included Chillum Gardens and Oakdale Terrace. The developers of these communities sold the lots but left the construction of houses to the lot owners. Consequently, the communities were slow to develop. In contrast, the developer-built Green Meadows and Brookdale Manor were platted in the early 1940s and completed by 1942. Other developer-built communities begun in the 1940s include Chillumgate (1946) and Michigan Hills Park (1940s). Several subdivisions were constructed along Riggs Road, Sargent Road, and Sligo Creek Park in the 1950s, including Sargent Knolls (1950), Bel Air Estates (1955), Parkland (1955), Carrington (1957), and Miller Estates (mid-1950s-early 1960s). The street pattern of these communities are typical of their period. They have a grid pattern of streets broken by a few curvilinear roadways and cul-de-sacs. In addition to single-family residences, two apartment communities were constructed in 1949. The Chillum Heights Apartments consist of three story brick structures containing a combined total of 1,147 units. Larger-scale apartment complexes and mid-rise structures were constructed in the 1960s.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Chillum-Adelphi Volunteer Fire Department (CAVFD) serves Chillum. The station is in Langley Park CDP and has an Adelphi postal address. In March 1951 and June 8, 1951 the CAVFD was established and chartered, respectively. From November and March 1953 the fire station on Riggs Road was constructed; the County Volunteer Firemen&#x27;s Association designated it Station No. 34. Portions of Station No. 34 were rebuilt in the early 1960s, and it was rededicated on November 16, 1963. In 1962 the CAVFD began building a substation, No. 44, which was dedicated on November 16, 1963, but in 1992 it sold the substation to the county government. PGFD Station 844 now provides fire and EMS services to the Chillum area.

==Education==
The Chillum CDP is served by public schools that are part of the Prince George&#x27;s County Public Schools System.

Elementary schools within the Chillum CDP include Chillum Elementary School, Cesar Chavez, Lewisdale, Rosa Parks, and Ridgecrest. Chavez was originally known as Parkway Elementary School. The school administration decided to rename the school after they found a liquor store had a similar name. According to principal Adela Acosta, the community chose Chavez since he was Hispanic/Latino as was most of the school&#x27;s students. The parent-teacher organization chose Chavez, the school held a public hearing on the matter on January 10, 2000, and the county board approved the name change on March 30, 2000; it was effective fall 2000.

Carole Highlands Elementary School has a Takoma Park postal address but is within the 2010-defined Langley Park CDP boundaries. As of the 1990 US Census and the 2000 US Census, Carole Highlands Elementary, as well as all of the Langley Park CDP areas south of Road 193, was in the Chillum CDP. Carole Highlands Elementary serves parts of the current Chillum CDP.

Nicholas Orem Middle School in Hyattsville and Buck Lodge Middle School in Adelphi CDP serve sections of the CDP. Northwestern High School in Hyattsville and High Point High School in Beltsville CDP serve sections of the CDP.

In addition to these public schools, Chillum is also served by four private schools; the St. John&#x27;s De La Salle School, Children&#x27;s Guild School, Parkway School, and the George E. Peters Adventist School.

==Parks and recreation==
The Chillum neighborhood is served by three parks:

1. Chillum Community Park (This park is located at the intersection of Ray Road and Cypress Creek Drive on the far east side of Chillum, located directly west of the Northwest Branch Anacostia River but directly south of the Sligo Creek River. This park is contained between two neighborhoods, Chillum and Avondale. The part of Chillum Community Park located west of the Northwest Branch Anacostia River is in Chillum while the part of Chillum Community Park located east of the Northwest Branch Anacostia River is in Avondale. Both sides of the Chillum Community Park consist of a small-size playground and small-size picnic pavilion. The only difference is that the Chillum Community Park contains a soccer field on the Chillum side while containing a small-size basketball court on the Avondale side.

2. Michigan Park Hills Neighborhood Park (This park is located at the intersection of Chillum Road and 15th Avenue, directly across the Chillum Community Park. This park consists of a small-size playground, tennis court, small basketball court, and two small benches.

3. Parklawn Community Park (This park is located on East West Highway directly east of where the Sligo Creek River intersects East West Highway. This small park with a playground, a county maintained park building, and direct access to the Sligo Creek Trail).

*In addition to these three parks, Chillum is also served by the Rollingrest Community Center/ Splash Pool, located on Sargent Road.

<text>Clinton is an unincorporated census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. Clinton was formerly known as Surrattsville until after the time of the Civil War, and Robeystown from 1865 to 1878. The population of Clinton was 38,760 at the 2020 census. Clinton is historically known for its role in the American Civil War concerning the Abraham Lincoln assassination. Clinton is adjacent to Camp Springs, Rosaryville, Melwood, and Andrews Air Force Base.

== History ==

Clinton was founded in the 1770s. The town, then named Surratt&#x27;s Villa, was actually a simple crossroads with a few buildings. In the 1800s, it became known as Surrattsville. The main building served as the post office, an inn and tavern, and a polling place. This main residence was one of two properties owned by the widowed Mary Surratt; the second property was in Washington, D.C.

On 14 and 15 April 1865, John Wilkes Booth, who had two hours earlier assassinated President Abraham Lincoln, stopped by the Surrattsville tavern to pick up weapons and supplies. The U.S. government alleged that Mary Surratt had gone there earlier with these supplies, and was in collusion with the conspirators, one of whom was her son, John Surratt. Because she was found guilty of complicity in the Lincoln assassination, Mary Surratt was hanged at the Capitol Prison in Washington D.C., on 7 July 1865. (Her house is now the Surratt House Museum, with a focus on the assassination.) The U.S. Post Office renamed the town Robeystown, due to the notoriety of the Surratt name, and in keeping with naming towns after the postmaster. In 1879, Robeystown was renamed Clinton. The local high school, however, retains the name of Surrattsville.

The Wyoming house, a historic frame house built in three phases between the 18th and early 19th centuries, is also a part of Clinton&#x27;s history. The house consists of a main block with gambrel roof (late 18th century), kitchen (c. 1800), and connecting block (c. 1850). The Wyoming house is listed in the Maryland Inventory of Historical Properties and the Historic American Buildings Survey.

In 1913, Blossie Keubeth Miller founded a general store at the town&#x27;s main intersection. The current commercial property, built in the 1950s, houses a liquor store and is still owned by the Miller family.

Yuri Nosenko, a KGB defector, was confined and interrogated at a safehouse in Clinton from April 4, 1964 to August 13, 1965.

Clinton is also associated with the 2002 Beltway sniper attacks. A survivor of the attacks was shot in Clinton, while Mildred Muhammad, ex-wife of sniper John Allen Muhammad, was a Clinton resident.

<text>Colmar Manor is a town located in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 1,404. As the town developed at the beginning of the 20th century, it assumed a name derived from its proximity to the District of Columbia—the first syllable of Columbia and that of Maryland were combined to form &quot;Colmar&quot;. Colmar Manor was incorporated in 1927.

==History==

===19th century===
The town is home to Dueling Creek, formerly in Bladensburg, Maryland, a small waterway that because of its secluded location was a popular site for dueling. Duels were banned in neighboring Washington, D.C., but legal in Maryland, and Dueling Creek was the site for more than 50 duels between 1808 and 1868. The most famous duel fought on the site was on March 22, 1820, between Stephen Decatur and James Barron. Decatur was mortally wounded in the exchange.

During the War of 1812, on August 24, 1814, the area was the scene of the Battle of Bladensburg. The place became a battlefield again in the early days of the Civil War when Confederate troops mounted an assault on Battery Jameson, Fort Lincoln, now northeast Washington, D.C., which was one of a number Union defensive forts built around the nation&#x27;s capital to protect it from capture. The remains of Fort Lincoln are located on the hillside that is now a part of Fort Lincoln Cemetery.

===20th century===
In 1912, the Capitol Cemetery of Prince George&#x27;s County was incorporated on the Washington, D.C., boundary line. Directly north of the cemetery was the Shreve estate. The Shreve house was destroyed in the 1890s. The farm site was used by the 6,000 jobless men from Ohio who descended on the Capitol in 1894 as &quot;Coxey&#x27;s Army&quot;. Bladensburg Road traversed the area, becoming more heavily traveled in the 1920s, and eventually became designated as U.S. Route 1. Part of the former Shreve estate was subdivided into building lots in 1918. The lots were wide by deep, arranged along a grid pattern of streets. The streets were originally named after President Woodrow Wilson (1913–21), members of his cabinet, and other prominent men of the era. Some time later, the streets were renamed to conform to the system in use in the District of Columbia. The location of the development within the first service area of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission offered homeowners modern water and sewer lines. The houses constructed were modest one- and two-story wood-frame buildings. In 1931, the town&#x27;s streets were paved and gutters were installed. A concrete block municipal building was constructed in 1934, followed by the construction of a brick schoolhouse in 1935. In 1959, a municipal building was constructed to house the town&#x27;s administrative offices and police department.

During the second half of the 20th century, the area along Bladensburg Road, now known as Alternate Route 1, became lined with commercial establishments, and much of the housing stock was used as rental units. A large urban renewal project in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in the demolition of many commercial properties along Bladenburg Road. The old businesses were replaced with new structures such as fast food restaurants and a shopping center. Streets and houses were also improved. The Colmar Manor Community Park was established along the west bank of the Anacostia River in the 1970s on the site of a sanitary landfill.

In 1999, Colmar Manor, Bladensburg, and Cottage City were lauded by the Joint Center for Sustainable Communities for their collaboration with Prince George&#x27;s County for the Port Towns Revitalization Initiative, which created a common Port Towns identity for the towns; encouraged businesses development through infrastructure and facade improvements; acquisition of historic properties and plans for their reuse; and reconstruction of the Bladensburg waterfront, marina and the Bladensburg Waterfront Park.

<text>Cottage City, officially the Town of Cottage City, is a town in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 1,335. Cottage City is a small, quiet community lying between Eastern Avenue (the border with Washington), Brentwood, Colmar Manor, and the Anacostia River. Cottage City was developed, beginning in 1870, under the name of &quot;The Highlands&quot;. The area was incorporated in 1924 as Cottage City.

==History==
Its history dates to pre-revolutionary America; old records indicate that the area was home to several of the Potomac River Indian tribes. With the coming of European settlers, the area became noted for its deep-water Anacostia River port, known then as Harrison&#x27;s Landing. Contributing to the economy of Harrison&#x27;s Landing was Moyer&#x27;s Grist Mill located in Yarrow, the very first mill of its type between Baltimore and Alexandria, Virginia. Yarrow was renamed several times, but today we know Yarrow as Cottage City.

Known as the Dark and Bloody Grounds, the former site of the Bladensburg Dueling Grounds was located along Dueling Creek and Bladensburg Road; the historic location now shares the present-day boundary of the towns of Cottage City and Colmar Manor. Cottage City and Moyer&#x27;s Mill played a key role in the Battle of Bladensburg during the War of 1812. The mill acted as a hospital for wounded American militia, as well as an artillery battery. American forces were repulsed in a bitter fight in Mr. Moyer&#x27;s orchards, an event that resulted ultimately in the burning of the nation&#x27;s capital.

During the post-Civil War years, President Ulysses S. Grant stayed at a summer retreat known as the Friendship House located in Cottage City. Friendship House is long gone, replaced in the 1940s by an apartment house located on 38th Avenue and Parkwood Street.

During the 1870s, groups of developers began to promote a residential community with large lots and a grid pattern of streets, stating the advantages of the community. &quot;The Highlands&quot; would feature cottages and villas on wide avenues, a good view, nominal taxes, and was close to Washington, D.C., the historic Bladensburg battlefield, spa spring, and dueling ground. The development failed despite the advertising campaign. In 1886, Colonel Gilbert Moyer bought the Highland tract, and incorporated the Highland Company in 1888. The land was re-subdivided into smaller lots, and Moyer promoted the land by including information that a streetcar line was soon to be developed in the area. This attempt to develop the area also failed. A few houses were developed on the Moyer property beginning in 1904 with broad streets laid out in a grid and trees planted along the street. A single-track trolley line ran through the community from Washington to Bladensburg. Called the Washington, Spa Spring and Gretta Railroad, the trolley was eventually discontinued in 1923, partially due to competition from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the streetcar line in Mount Rainier.

In 1915, Charles Lightbrown borrowed money and attempted to market the subdivision plat from 1888 with a few minor changes. This attempt succeeded where the two earlier attempts had failed. Lightbrown built most of the housing in the community. Consisting of one-story cottages with four rooms and no running water, the housing was attractive to veterans returning from World War I who needed economical homes which were ready to inhabit. Electric service was introduced to the community in 1914. In 1919, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission installed water service to the town; sewer service was added the following year. The town was incorporated in 1924, taking its name from the uniform cottages built by Charles Lightbrown.

The exorcism of Roland Doe, the story that was the basis for the 1971 novel and 1973 film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, has its roots in Cottage City.

In 1999, Cottage City, Bladensburg, and Colmar Manor were lauded by the Joint Center for Sustainable Communities for their collaboration with Prince George&#x27;s County for the Port Towns Revitalization Initiative, which created a common &quot;Port Towns&quot; identity for the towns; encouraged businesses development through infrastructure and façade improvements; acquisition of historic properties and plans for their reuse; and reconstruction of the Bladensburg waterfront and marina.

Today, Cottage City is a small, ethnically mixed community with old cottage-style homes that sit on tree-lined streets. The community is an active and enthusiastic partner with the county in the Port Towns Redevelopment Plan, an effort to revitalize the neighborhoods while preserving their historic heritages. The riches that the town hopes to gain by this effort are an improved environment and an improved quality of life for its citizens.

==Geography==
District Heights is located at (38.859545, −76.889139).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
District Heights was originally farmland owned by Major Leander P. Williams, purchased as four patented Lord Baltimore tracts known as: &quot;Good Luck,&quot; &quot;Magruder&#x27;s Plains Enlarged,&quot; &quot;the Levels,&quot; and &quot;Offutt&#x27;s Adventure.&quot; Under grants issued to Lord Baltimore by King Charles I of Great Britain, the tracts belonged to Colonel Ninian Beall, Benjamin Berry, and Alexander Magruder. District Heights evolved from one of the four patents. In 1925, 505-acres of the Williams farm was purchased and formed into the District Heights Company by Joseph Tepper, David L. Blanken, Henry Oxenberg, Gilbert Leventhal, Simon Gordon, and Simon Gerber. The land was farmed by Walter and Al Dustin, whose farmhouse stood at 7116 Foster Street. By 1925, streets laid out first three blocks of Halleck Street and Aztec. By 1926, the city had approximately 25 homes built, two businesses, a grocery store and filling station, a pump house and water tower to furnish the water and pressure for the City, a sewage system and a free Model T bus service to 17th and Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E. The Town of District Heights was incorporated in 1936 and recognized by act of the Maryland General Assembly. Many of the Cape Cod style houses seen today date to the 1940s, when several developers constructed affordable, single-family, houses with financing from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), anticipating sales to federal employees and veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, the remaining and undeveloped 300-acres was bought and developed by New York City builder Samuel R. Rosoff, who established Washington Estates, Inc., thus adding additional tracts to District Heights which include areas now occupied by garden apartments.

==Law enforcement==
The District Heights Police Department (DHPD) is the primary law enforcement agency for the City of District Heights which is located in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. An agreement exists with Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department and the Prince George&#x27;s County Sheriff&#x27;s Office that outlines mutual aid assistance. Assistance is also provided by neighboring municipal agencies.

Officers serve the City Commission and the citizens who reside in and around the Municipal Corporation of District Heights. District Heights is located within the 8th District of the Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department. The two agencies work closely together responding to calls for service as well as solving crimes. Although the crime rate as reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation is twenty~two percent higher than the national average, this number represents both the non-corporate and corporate portions of District Heights.

The District Heights Police Department began in 1936. Over the years, it has seen many different officers. In 2012, Chief Michael March (Ret) retired, sparking the City Commission to temporarily appoint Chief (Fmr) Yolanda Alexander. Chief Alexander served as acting Chief for more than a year until she was fully sworn in as Chief of Police in October 2013. Her contract as Chief for the District Heights Police Department was not renewed after May 2014 City Mayoral and Commission elections. Several members stated a difference of opinion. Chief Elliott Gibson was hired in May 2014, as Police Chief. Chief Gibson had a long history and experience in law enforcement. Chief Gibson received numerous commendations and awards for his community service during his tenure. Chief Gibson was terminated by the City Commission after new Commissioners were elected in May 2019. The police department was overseen by the District 8 Commander and Asst. Commander of the Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department until November 2020 when Interim Chief Kinsey Weems was appointed. Chief Weems has been a member of the agency since 2013.

In March 2021, numerous fire and police agencies announced the arrest of former District Heights Police Chief David Michael Crawford in connection to a dozen fires between 2011 and 2020. In March 2022 Crawford entered an Alford plea to one count of first-degree arson for setting a garage in Jefferson, Frederick County, ablaze on April 3, 2018, while the occupants of the attached home were in bed; he awaits sentencing while active arson cases against Crawford in Montgomery, Howard, and Prince George&#x27;s counties continue.

Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department District 8 Station in Upper Marlboro CDP serves the community.

==Fire Department/Emergency Medical Services==
District Heights is served by the District Heights Volunteer Fire Department, Prince George&#x27;s Fire Company 826, providing fire, rescue, and ambulance services. Located at 5900 Marlboro Pike, the station is named after Retired Chief Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Stommel, who served as a firefighter for 50 years and Volunteer Chief for over 40 years. The modern station was dedicated in October 2008. The old brick-built fire house still stands repurposed at the corner of 6208 Marlboro Pike and Scott Key Drive.

In 1817, George Weems established the Weems Steamboat Company, connecting Trueman Point to other landings along the Patuxent River. He also built a tobacco warehouse, and ships routinely stopped at Trueman Landing. The steamboat traffic continued into the 1930s.

Bean purchased land adjoining Trueman Point with the vision of creating a resort community for middle-class African Americans from the area. Lots were offered for $50.00 or less, and the community was advertised as &quot;a high class summer colony for the better people.&quot; After a number of summer cottages were constructed, the community incorporated as the town of Eagle Harbor in 1929.

<text>Edmonston is a town in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 1,617.

The community is located from Washington, D.C. Edmonston&#x27;s ZIP code is 20781.

==History==
The area of present-day Edmonston probably acquired its name from Captain James Edmonston, a member of a prominent Bladensburg, Maryland, family. He was called &quot;Captain&quot; because he owned a large ship. In 1742, he paid five shillings for a piece of land upon which the town of Edmonston eventually developed. The Edmonston Family had been active in local Revolutionary War effort and were descendants of the Family Edmonstone of Duntreath Castle, Scotland.

The first modern settlers of the community were Adam Francis Plummer and his wife Emily Saunders Arnold Plummer, who had been slaves of the powerful Calvert family on the Riversdale Plantation in present-day Riverdale Park. After the Civil War, Adam Plummer purchased ten acres of land for $1000, south of the plantation and sought out and recovered family members that had been sold during slavery to deep south plantations, thus establishing the settlement. A skilled horticulturalist, Plummer named the settlement Mt. Rose after his favorite plant and copious rose gardens. Notably, Adam Plummer kept a diary as a slave which today is the only known living slave diary and is a featured exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Anacostia Community Museum.

Two subdivisions that would later comprise the town of Edmonston were platted in 1903: East Hyattsville and Palestine. The eastern section was developed in 1903 by J. Harris Rogers on two parcels of land he purchased in the 1880s and 1890s. Rogers platted into a subdivision of more than 170 lots known as East Hyattsville. The western half began with the subdivision of Dr. Charles A. Wells. Wells purchased the Palestine Farm from Benjamin Franklin Guy in 1878 and 1879 and continued the farm&#x27;s dairy operations until 1903. In that year, 25 of the farm&#x27;s acres were subdivided into 62 building lots of various sizes. Within the first decade, 55 houses were constructed in both subdivisions and many of them remain today. The earliest buildings were simple vernacular buildings such as the &quot;I&quot; house that were later adapted to the constraints of the narrow suburban building lot.

In the late 19th century, a pumping station was constructed in the Palestine subdivision that supplied water to the city of Hyattsville. In 1920, operations were taken over by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. Also in the Palestine subdivision was the first school to serve the future town of Edmonston. Constructed in 1915, the building has undergone several phases of additions and alterations.

After World War I, the residents of East Hyattsville and Palestine began a movement toward incorporation to improve services. Compared to the established Hyattsville, incorporated in 1886, East Hyattsville contained more working class residents, more modest houses, and more immigrants. When incorporating in 1924, the residents decided to choose a name that would give the town an identity independent from Hyattsville and chose &quot;Edmonston&quot; after a major north-south road adjacent to the town and the original landowner. By 1924, there were several hundred residents; at 49th Avenue and Decatur Street, there was a small neighborhood center with a few stores and a post office. Only the small grocery store remains today. The first items on the agenda for the new municipality were street paving and lighting, construction of a concrete bridge across the Anacostia River, and arrangement with the fledgling Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission to bring water and sewer pipes into the town.

Edmonston&#x27;s mayor in 1927 was Kinjiro Matsudaira, the grandson of a Japanese feudal lord. His election received attention in the Philadelphia press at the time with the somewhat inaccurate lead, &quot;Japanese Elected Mayor of American City for the First Time in History.&quot; His father, Tadaatsu, came to the United States in 1872 to study and stayed to marry an American woman and pursue a distinguished career in civil engineering. Kinjiro Matsudaira, born in Pennsylvania in 1885, was elected Mayor of Edmonston for a second time in 1943, during World War II.

In 1925, an undeveloped part of the original Palestine subdivision was platted as the Funkhouser subdivision. The land was divided into 40 lots upon which Robert Funkhouser constructed a small bungalow on each. The houses were completed in 1926 and quickly sold. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, development consisted of sporadic house construction on vacant lots within the established subdivisions. After World War II, the Edmonston Terrace subdivision was constructed consisting of an organized development of 41 nearly identical two-story, brick side-gable houses. Residential construction during the 1950s and 1960s returned to infill. Also constructed during the 1960s was the Fountain Park apartment complex.

From 2003-2006, Edmonston struggled from a series of floods resulting from high volumes of stormwater and the now-inadequate flood pumping station. The Town successfully advocated Prince George&#x27;s County Government for a new state-of-the-art $6 million facility, which received recognition for its utilization of three massive Archimedes&#x27; screws, a flood pumping technology developed by the eponymous ancient Greek mathematician rarely utilized on such a scale in the United States.

==Complete Green Street==
In November 2009, the Town broke ground on its &quot;Green Street&quot; in a ceremony attended by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa Jackson. The completed project was dedicated in November 2010 with significant national attention for pioneering the combination of low impact development and complete street principles. The street features LED streetlights, a green power purchase agreement, elevated crosswalks, traffic calming bump-out raingardens and permeable pavement bike lanes that together capture nearly 100% of stormwater runoff. The project has received various awards and recognition, including an &quot;Innovations in Infrastructure&quot; award by the White House&#x27;s Champions for Change Program and sparked the adoption of policies requiring complete green streets in municipalities nationwide.

==Government==
The Edmonston municipal government consists of four members of council and a mayor who, beginning in May 2008, are elected to three-year terms. Elected positions are essentially volunteer in nature and are paid a small stipend for expenses. The structure of the government is a mostly &quot;strong&quot; mayor system, meaning that the mayor has administrative control over government operations and presents his or her budget each year for adoption, though the appointment of department heads must meet the approval of the council. Edmonston&#x27;s mayor sits as president of the council, though can only vote to break a tie on the council.

==History==

Two Washington, D.C. land developers and lawyers, Allen Clark and Robinson White, platted the first subdivision of Fairmount Heights; separate developers platted the remaining five. Land speculators had purchased the farms that were previously in the area and consolidated the land for development. Clark and White sold the lots to African-Americans. Service on the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway to the Gregory Station of nearby Seat Pleasant was established in 1908. Fairmount Heights incorporated in 1935 with all six subdivisions. The Fairmount Heights 
Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

Residents asked the county government for one in the beginning of 1911, and in April of that year the county board asked for the establishment of the school. The Mount Zion Apostolic Faith Church purchased the building in 1934; at that time a brick school building on Addison Road, with eight classrooms, became the new school building.

<doc id="116523" wikidata="Q754626" url="?curid=116523" title="Forest Heights, Maryland">
<text>Forest Heights is a town in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, and is part of the larger postal designation of Oxon Hill. The town straddles both sides of dual-lane Maryland Route 210 and includes two elementary schools. Per the 2020 census, the population was 2,658.

==History==
A few homes (such as on Huron Drive) were built in the 1930s, but most of the town developed in the 1940s and early 1950s, consisting of single-family homes with some streets of duplex homes; the Talbert Drive homes were added in the 1960s. In those days many town residents were scientists (as Mayor Armhold was) at the adjacent U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, while others were military band musicians or other Federal employees. The town&#x27;s population figure declined substantially over several decades, but since 2000 is now rising again.

Two especially long-serving mayors were Clifford Armhold and Warren F. Adams.

After decades of former governmental stability, in the 2000s the town made headlines repeatedly as two of its recent mayors were embroiled in clashes with the town council. One mayor, Joyce Beck, was ousted from office after changes to the Town Charter. In June 2009 her successor, Myles Spires, filed a $15 million lawsuit against the town for malicious prosecution after being cleared of all charges initiated by the town for misuse of town&#x27;s funds. In 2019, the town annexed 446.88 acres of additional land, more than doubling its size.

==Geography==
Forest Heights is located at (38.811863, -76.996809). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.3% of the population.

The town is served by its own Forest Heights Police Department, which maintains primary responsibility for the response to and prevention and investigation of the majority of all crimes within the corporate limits. Under a memorandum of understanding, the Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department serves as the secondary responding law enforcement agency for the town, and the primary investigating agency for most serious crimes, such as homicide or rape. Since 2019 the Chief of Police has been Anthony Rease.

The County Police Department maintains its District IV station just outside Forest Height&#x27;s northern border at Eastover Shopping Center, in Glassmanor CDP. Fire and rescue services are provided by Prince George&#x27;s County Fire Department from neighboring Company 42 and Company 21, both in Oxon Hill.

==Transportation==

The most prominent highway serving Forest Heights is Interstate 95/Interstate 495 (the Capital Beltway). I-495 follows the Capital Beltway around Washington, D.C., providing access to its many other suburbs. I-95 only follows the eastern portion of the beltway, diverging away from the beltway near both its north and south ends. To the north, I-95 passes through Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City and Boston on its way to Canada, while to the south, it traverses Richmond on its way to Florida.

Maryland Route 210 and Maryland Route 414 also serve Forest Heights. MD 210 provides the direct access from Forest Heights to I-95/I-495, following Indian Head Highway from the Washington, D.C. border southward to Indian Head. MD 414 follows Saint Barnabas Road, running parallel to the Capital Beltway and providing local access to nearby communities.

<text>Fort Washington is an unincorporated area and census-designated place in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. It borders the Potomac River, situated 20 miles south of downtown Washington, D.C. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 24,261. The Fort Washington community is located west of Maryland Route 210, with some additional area to the east of the highway.

==History==
===The Fort===

The community is named for Fort Washington. The first Fort Washington was completed in 1809, and it was the only defensive fort protecting Washington, D.C. until the American Civil War. It consisted of a small earthwork near the shore of the Potomac River. The failure of that fort to stop a British fleet from invading the national capital during the War of 1812 led to the construction of the current, larger, stone fortification. In 1844, a cannon exploded on the USS &quot;Princeton&quot; as it was passing Fort Washington. During World War II, the US Army&#x27;s Adjutant General&#x27;s School was located at the fort, and had billeting for 362 officers and 2,526 enlisted persons.

The site is now part of a park with views of the Potomac River and hiking paths.

===War of 1812===
During the War of 1812 Fort Washington, built to protect the capital from enemy advances on the Potomac River, was captured by the British under the command of Admiral Gordon, three days after the burning of the capital.

===Civil War===

Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, fearing for the safety of Washington in case of attack, Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey ordered a detachment of US Marines to garrison the fort.

In May 1865 Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles ordered the Potomac Flotilla reduced to half strength due to cessation of hostilities. This included the removal of the Marines from Fort Washington.

===Twentieth century to present===

Near the fort are many riverfront homes, two marinas, two community pools, and National Golf Club. The area was rural until about 1960, when suburban growth began. Until the founding of the Oxon Hill post office about 1960, the Fort Washington area generally used the mailing address Washington, D.C., except for the few years that Friendly had a post office. In 1980, the postal service split the Fort Washington area from Oxon Hill, defining it as a separate town name. At that time, to make mail sorting easier, they drew the boundary between the two communities to conform to already existing zip code boundaries. The end result sometimes confuses people, since the northern end of the Fort Washington postal area (near the Beltway) identifies more with the communities of Oxon Hill or Temple Hills / Camp Springs but still uses a Fort Washington mailing address.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 16.8%, is water.

First-time visitors are often confused by the several &quot;Livingston Roads&quot;, which repeatedly cross Route 210, as well as by the two separate &quot;Old Fort Roads&quot;, causing them to make wrong turns off of Maryland Route 210. Eventually, all roads intersecting Route 210 in the Fort Washington area (from the Beltway as far south as the Highway 210 curve at Piscataway Creek) will be upgraded to controlled-access interchanges (eliminating all traffic signals) gradually during the 2020s.

The fort&#x27;s land originally included 347 acres, which was last surveyed in June 1944.

==Community institutions==
The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC) maintains the Harmony Hall Regional Center , including the John Addison Concert Hall, site of community theater (&quot;Tantallon Community Players&quot;), art shows, frequent concerts, and a variety of classes for all ages. A YMCA fitness center operated from 2005 until 2016, and a community center facility opened in 2013 in Fort Washington Forest.

The 12,000-member Ebenezer A.M.E. Church is a large nursery/landscaping business and a popular motorcycle shop. There is a small 50-bed hospital (Fort Washington Hospital).

==Government==
Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department District 7 Station in Fort Washington CDP serves the community.

The U.S. Postal Service operates the Fort Washington Post Office in Fort Washington CDP.

The Interagency Training Center, a training center for the National Security Agency, is based in Fort Washington CDP.

<text>Greater Upper Marlboro is an area of Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, that completely surrounds Upper Marlboro, the county seat. It was formerly a census-designated place (CDP), with a population of 18,720 at the 2000 census. However, the 2010 census divided the area into several smaller CDPs, including portions of Marlboro Meadows, Brock Hall, Marlboro Village, Queenland, and Croom.

==Geography==
Greater Upper Marlboro is located at .

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Greater Upper Marlboro (red area on this map) had a total area of , of which was land and , or 0.75%, was water. The local zip code mailing address of &quot;Greater Upper Marlboro&quot;, however, covers of territory and includes additional areas west and south of the red area, extending from the Capital Beltway (Largo, Westphalia, and New Orchard areas) on the west to the Patuxent River/county line on the east, and far southward into the rural Croom and Nottingham, Naylor, and Rosaryville areas (greatly below the map&#x27;s red area).

==Education==
Residents of the former census-designated place are zoned to schools in the Prince George&#x27;s County Public Schools district.

Elementary schools serving the former CDP:
* Arrowhead
* Marlton
* Mattaponi
* Melwood
* Barack Obama
* Patuxent
* Perrywood
* Pointer Ridge

Residents of the former CDP are zoned to the following middle schools: Kettering, James Madison, Gwynn Park, and Benjamin Tasker. Residents of the former CDP are zoned to the following high schools: Frederick Douglass, Largo, Dr. Henry A. Wise, Jr., and Bowie.

The very large Prince George&#x27;s Community College campus is in Largo, at the northern end of the area, and has an Upper Marlboro mailing address.

==Housing==
Numerous local planned suburban developments have gradually blossomed throughout the community, starting in the 1960s, with large, new homes still continuing to go up. These communities include Kettering, Marlton, Brock Hall, Marlboro Meadows, Melwood Park, and others.

==Religious institutions==
There are several megachurches, such as Evangel Cathedral, the First Baptist of Glenarden and the Ark of Safety Christian Church.

St. Barnabas Church, one of the oldest churches in Maryland, is located here, along with St. Mary&#x27;s of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church. First Baptist Church of Upper Marlboro (established 1959), Greater St. John Baptist Church (established in DC in 1963) and Cornerstone Peaceful Baptist Church, formed in 1987 as a merger of the Cornerstone Baptist and Peaceful Baptist Churches, are also located in Greater Upper Marlboro.

Several churches in the area run private schools: Riverdale Baptist School, Excellence Christian School, Divine Peace Lutheran, and Life Church Ministries.

<text>Greenbelt is a city in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, and a suburb of Washington, D.C. At the 2020 census, the population was 24,921.

Greenbelt is the first and the largest of the three experimental and controversial New Deal Greenbelt Towns, the others being Greenhills, Ohio, and Greendale, Wisconsin. Greenbelt was planned and built by the federal government as an all-white town. The cooperative community was conceived in 1935 by Undersecretary of Agriculture Rexford Guy Tugwell, whose perceived collectivist ideology attracted opposition to the Greenbelt Towns project throughout its short duration. The project came into legal existence on April 8, 1935, when Congress passed the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935. Under the authority granted to him by this legislation, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, on May 1, 1935, establishing the United States Resettlement Administration (RA/RRA).

First called &quot;Maryland Special Project No. 1&quot;, the project was officially named Greenbelt when the Division of Suburban Resettlement of the Resettlement Administration began construction, on January 13, 1936, about eight miles north of Washington. The complete Greenbelt plans were reviewed at the White House by President Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on April 30, 1936. The first tenants, after selection in a stringent application process, moved in to the town on September 30, 1937. The construction consisted of structures built in the Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, and Bauhaus architectural styles.

Greenbelt is credited as a historic milestone in urban development because it was the initial model for the privately constructed suburban Washington, D.C., planned cities of Reston, Virginia, and Columbia, Maryland.

The original federally-built core of the city, known locally as &quot;Old Greenbelt&quot;, was recognized as the Greenbelt Historic District by the Maryland Historical Trust, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark District.

Greenbelt&#x27;s population, which includes residents of privately built dwellings dating from after the end of the federal government&#x27;s ownership of the city, was recorded as at the 2010 U.S. Census and 24,921 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Greenbelt is located at . According to United States Census Bureau data, as of January 1, 2018, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Greenbelt&#x27;s ZIP Codes are 20770, 20771, and 20768. The ZIP Code 20770 contains all residential and business addresses that correspond to actual physical locations inside the geographic boundaries of the City of Greenbelt. The 20768 ZIP Code is assigned exclusively to post-office box (P.O. Box) addresses, while 20771 is the designated ZIP Code for Goddard Space Flight Center, situated on federal government owned land that is contiguous with a portion of Greenbelt&#x27;s eastern border.

NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center, located directly adjacent to Greenbelt&#x27;s eastern boundary, utilizes a Greenbelt postal address (Greenbelt, MD 20768), as well. It is partially within the former Goddard census-designated place.

Greenbelt Park, a unit of the National Park System, is located within the City of Greenbelt&#x27;s boundaries, at its southernmost portion.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
Two major highways pass through and have interchanges in Greenbelt: the Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495) and the National Park Service&#x27;s owned and maintained portion of the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (unsigned MD 295). The Greenbelt portion of the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (B–W Parkway) is part of the parkway&#x27;s 19-mile section which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

Additionally, Greenbelt Road is part of state highway MD 193, which connects several suburban communities in both Prince George&#x27;s and Montgomery counties. Kenilworth Avenue (MD 201) traverses Greenbelt in a north–south direction, running parallel to the B–W Parkway, providing an alternate travel route into Washington, D.C., from Greenbelt. The southernmost Maryland portion of Kenilworth Avenue forms a major interchange with both the B–W Parkway and US 50 near the Maryland–D.C. line, and continues into Washington, as the Kenilworth Avenue Freeway (DC 295).

===Public transportation===

Washington Metro&#x27;s rapid transit rail system serves Washington, D.C., and neighboring communities in Maryland and Northern Virginia, by operating 98 Metro stations, which includes the Greenbelt station, the northern terminus of Metro&#x27;s Green Line. Commuter rail service to the station is provided by MARC Train&#x27;s Camden Line, which connects the District of Columbia&#x27;s Washington Union Station with Camden Station in Baltimore. The Camden Line provides service by utilizing the original 1835 Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) track route between Washington and Baltimore, now part of the CSX System.

Also available at Greenbelt station was a weekday express Metrobus service, the Greenbelt–BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport Express Line (commonly shortened to the Greenbelt–BWI Airport Line), designated route B30, to Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI), a mode of transportation to and from the airport for airline passengers, in addition to allowing for connections to Baltimore&#x27;s regional transit services. This service ended in 2020.

Metrobus, Prince George&#x27;s County&#x27;s &quot;THE BUS&quot; (routes 11 and 15X), and the University of Maryland&#x27;s Shuttle-UM (route 143; University ID required) each have bus routes which serve the city of Greenbelt. Through a city–university partnership between 2017 and 2019, Greenbelt residents were permitted to unlimited travel on Shuttle UM, with the purchase of a $10 annual pass. The City operates limited transportation via the Greenbelt Connection, a 12-passenger wheelchair-accessible van.

==History==

Greenbelt was settled on September 30, 1937, as a public cooperative community in the New Deal era. The concept was at the same time both eminently practical and idealistically utopian: the federal government would foster an &quot;ideal&quot; self-sufficient cooperative community that would also ease the pressing housing shortage near the nation&#x27;s capital. Construction of the new town would also create jobs and thus help stimulate the national economic recovery following the Great Depression.

Greenbelt, which provided affordable housing for federal government workers, was one of three Greenbelt Towns conceived in 1935, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Brain Trust member Rexford Tugwell, who was serving as the president&#x27;s Undersecretary of Agriculture. The project was officially authorized in May 1935. First, on April 8, 1935, the United States Congress passed the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935. Then under the authority granted to him from this legislation, President Roosevelt issued an executive order, on May 1, 1935, establishing the United States Resettlement Administration (RA / RRA). Rexford Tugwell agreed to serve as the Administrator of the Resettlement Administration, in addition to his Undersecretary of Agriculture position, without receiving any additional salary.

Working alongside Tugwell was Charles W. Yost. The two other Greenbelt Towns are Greendale, Wisconsin (near Milwaukee) and Greenhills, Ohio (near Cincinnati). A fourth town, Roosevelt, New Jersey (originally called Homestead), was planned but was not fully developed on the same large scale as Greenbelt.

Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, helped Tugwell lay out the Maryland town on a site that had formerly consisted largely of tobacco fields. She was also heavily involved in the first cooperative community designed by the federal government in the New Deal Era, Arthurdale, West Virginia, which sought to improve the lives of impoverished laborers by enabling them to create a self-sufficient, and relatively prosperous, cooperative community. Cooperatives in Greenbelt include the &quot;Greenbelt News Review&quot;, Greenbelt Consumers Coop grocery store, the New Deal Cafe, and the cooperative forming the downtown core of original housing, Greenbelt Homes Incorporated (GHI).

The architectural planning of Greenbelt was innovative, as was the social engineering involved in this federal government project. Applicants for residency were interviewed and screened based on income and occupation, and willingness to become involved in community activities. African-Americans were initially excluded, but were later included by the Greenbelt Committee for Fair Housing founded in 1963, and came to account for 41% of residents, according to the 2000 census. The same census data also indicates that African-Americans are isolated in certain parts within the town, and the percentage of African-Americans within the historic area is between 0% and 5% on most blocks. Much of the federal government planned and developed portion of the city is located within the Greenbelt Historic District.

Greenbelt was the subject of the 1939 documentary film &quot;The City&quot;.

In 2021, the city created a reparations task force to study the issue of whether or not to award reparations to African-Americans in Greenbelt.

==Government==
The City of Greenbelt operates under a council-manager government as established by the city charter, the first such arrangement in Maryland. The Council consists of seven members elected by plurality-at-large voting. From their members, the Council selects the Mayor and the Mayor Pro Tem (who assumes the duties of the Mayor when the Mayor is unavailable). The Council has traditionally chosen the member with the highest vote count to be Mayor and the member with the second-highest vote count as Mayor Pro Tem. Elections are held every two years, in odd-numbered years, in part to diminish the influence of political parties. Political party affiliations are not an official part of the city election process and are seldom part of candidate campaigns. Regular council meetings are held on Mondays, twice per month except during July, August, and December, when meetings are held once per month.

The City Council is supported by 14 advisory boards and committees of citizen volunteers. The council appoints a professional city manager responsible for supervising government operations and implementing the policies adopted by the council.

The 2021 election selected the current city council:
* Mayor: Emmett V. Jordan
* Mayor Pro Tem: Kristen L. K. Weaver
* Council Members: Danielle McKinney, Jennifer Pompi, Amy Knessel, Silke Pope, and Rodney Roberts

The council selects the City Manager:

* City Manager:Josué Salmerón

===2009 election reform===
Of the ten incorporated cities in Prince George&#x27;s County, Greenbelt is one of three with at-large elections for council and mayor (the others are District Heights and New Carrollton). The remaining seven use combinations of districts and at-large voting. On February 28, 2008, the Maryland American Civil Liberties Union and Prince George&#x27;s County NAACP sent a letter to the Greenbelt City Council claiming that Greenbelt&#x27;s at-large system may violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. According to the letter, the 2000 Census indicated that African-Americans constituted 38% of Greenbelt&#x27;s voting-age population, Asians 13%, and Latinos 6%. At the time, however, all members of the city council were white. The letter proposed that the city switch to single-winner district-based voting, cumulative voting, or choice voting, and indicated a lawsuit would follow if no reform were implemented. While the city population is racially diverse, only two African Americans had run for Council in the 30 years preceding the 2009 election, one of whom had withdrawn before the election. In June 2008, the United States Department of Justice opened an investigation into the city&#x27;s election system.

In 2008, the city government hosted three public community meetings regarding election reform, in concert with the ACLU, NAACP, and FairVote. Over 100 residents attended the forums, including one of the unsuccessful African American candidates, Jeanette
Gordy, who said, &quot;My concern is that people don&#x27;t get off their royal behinds. By going to meetings I got what I wanted and found out I had power as a citizen.&quot;

In 2009, the city implemented several election reforms with the goal of increasing diversity: increasing the city council from five to seven members, adding another precinct in Greenbelt East to shorten voter lines, and amending the city charter to allow early voting.

<text>Hyattsville is a city in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. It is an urban suburb of Washington, D.C. The population was 21,187 at the 2020 United States census.

== History ==
Before Europeans reached the area, the upper Anacostia River was home to Nacotchtank/Anaquashtank people, a Piscataway-speaking Algonquian peoples who lived throughout what is now the Washington, D.C., area. European encroachment and diseases decimated their population and by the 1680s the Nacotchtank/Anaquashtank had largely moved away and merged with other tribes. 

In the 1720s, John Beall acquired land in the area and established Beall Town, but the town did not prosper like its neighbor Bladensburg. The opening of the Washington–Baltimore Turnpike (modern day ) in 1812 and the B&amp;O Railroad Washington Branch line in 1835 brought more settlers to the area.

The city&#x27;s founder, Christopher Clark Hyatt (1799–1884), purchased his first parcel of land in the area in 1845. Hyatt opened a store and began mail delivery, officially naming the nascent community &quot;Hyattsville&quot; in his 1859 application to become postmaster. In the years following the Civil War, Hyatt and other local landowners subdivided their properties and sold lots, and the population of Hyattsville grew. Hyattsville was incorporated as a city on April 7, 1886.

In 1893, the Hyattsville Board of Commissioners changed their property tax to only apply to the value of land, and not improvements. Opponents of this brought the action to court, and, after an appeal, the Maryland Court of Appeals found it to violate the Maryland constitution and struck it down.

=== Revitalization projects ===
Since 2000, the city has undergone a major redevelopment, including significant residential and retail development in the Arts District Hyattsville (located in the Gateway Arts District), and the area surrounding the Hyattsville Crossing station and The Mall at Prince George&#x27;s.

, additional residential and retail development is underway near the West Hyattsville Metro station. Along Route 1, craft brewers and distillers have played a notable role in revitalizing old commercial properties.

During the era of legally-required racial segregation of schools, black students from Hyattsville attended Lakeland High School in College Park in the period 1928–1950. Fairmont Heights High School, then near Fairmount Heights, replaced Lakeland High and served black students only from 1950 to 1964. During 1964, legally-required racial segregation of schools ended.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Roads and highways====

Several major surface highways serve Hyattsville. The most prominent of these is U.S. Route 1, which follows Rhode Island Avenue and Baltimore Avenue through the center of the city. US 1 connects southward to Washington, D.C., and northward through College Park to Interstate 95/Interstate 495 (the Capital Beltway). U.S. Route 1 Alternate follows the southern section of Baltimore Avenue to Bladensburg and provides an alternate route to Washington, D.C. Maryland Route 410 follows East-West Highway, connecting many of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s inner suburbs with Hyattsville. Two other state highways serving to connect Hyattsville to nearby towns include Maryland Route 208 and Maryland Route 500.

====Public transportation====
The Hyattsville Crossing and West Hyattsville Metro station both serve Hyattsville. Hyattsville is also served by the Riverdale MARC commuter train station, as well as a few Metrobus and TheBus routes. Students and staff at the University of Maryland have access to the free Shuttle–UM bus that goes from historic Hyattsville to the University of Maryland campus in College Park.

====Bikeways====
Hyattsville is well connected to the regional Anacostia Tributary Trail System network of hiker–biker trails, including the Northwest Branch Trail, which runs along the southern and western sides of the city, and the Rhode Island Avenue Trolley Trail. Numerous city streets include bicycle sharrows, along with a few unprotected bike lanes. Capital Bikeshare has eight bikeshare stations within the city.

===Law enforcement===
Prince George&#x27;s County Police Department District 1 Station in Hyattsville serves areas outside of the city that are not located in an incorporated municipality that maintains its own police department.

In 2017, the Hyattsville City Police Department became the first law enforcement agency in the United States to put a Chevrolet Bolt (all-electric) fully marked police patrol vehicle into service. It has since added an all-electric police motorcycle, and six public electric vehicle charging stations, which are free to use by the public.

On May 1, ABC formally apologized to both the city and county.

The detective novelist George Pelecanos, based in Washington D.C., has included Hyattsville in some of his novels, including &quot;The Man Who Came Uptown&quot;.

<text>Lake Arbor is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The population was 14,541 at the 2020 census. The ZIP Codes encompassing the CDP area are 20721 and 20774.

In the 1990s, the U.S. Census Bureau defined the area now delineated as Lake Arbor CDP as being in Mitchellville CDP. The Lake Arbor CDP was delineated as of the 2000 U.S. Census.

==History==
Lake Arbor was originally known as Newbridge, a development of Levitt &amp; Sons, developers of the early planned communities of Levittown in Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York, respectively. When the project went bankrupt in the mid-1970s after selling only 41 houses, Manufacturer&#x27;s Hanover Trust acquired the debt and held it as REO (real estate owned) for approximately 10 years until a limited partnership composed of David A. Gitlitz, Alvin Dworman, Phillip Abrahms, Phillip D. Winn, and Gary S. Lachman acquired it. Under the direction of Gitlitz, and with technical engineering assistance from Abrahms, Lachman changed the name of the property to Lake Arbor.

The story of Lake Arbor is emblematic of the socio-economic and demographic evolution of Prince George&#x27;s County that occurred in the mid-1980s. Against the strong resistance of many large national builders who perceived Prince George’s County as a price-sensitive retreat for urban African Americans who neither wanted nor could afford upscale amenities for their homes, community developers like Porten Sullivan, Pulte, Winchester, George T. Farrell of Morgan Investments and Jon Laria from Laria Builders built features like two-car garages, brick, fronts and elaborate landscaping and built 2000 luxury homes in this community in the 1980s, initiating a new path for the rest of Lake Arbor Community. Reynolds Real Estate acted as selling realtor and Industrial Bank of Washington provided construction and purchase financing. To the pleasant surprise of the builders, buyers rushed to embrace (and pay for) these features. Firmly demonstrating both the sophisticated tastes and buying power of the predominantly African American market, as well as codifying architectural standards requested (but not mandated) by county executives such as Winnie Kelly and Governor Parris Glendening, Lake Arbor established Prince George’s County as the most desirable destination for young, affluent African American families moving from Washington, DC for a suburban lifestyle.

It is located inside the Capital Beltway, on the northwest edge of Prince George&#x27;s County, bordering Montgomery County. Per the 2020 census, the population was 20,126.

==History==

&quot;Langley Park&quot; refers to the Langley Park estate established in 1923 by the McCormick-Goodhart family in the Chillum District of Prince George&#x27;s County. The name McCormick-Goodhart represented the linking of one of Chicago&#x27;s oldest families, that of Cyrus McCormick, with that of British barrister Frederick E. McCormick-Goodhart. Frederick&#x27;s wife Henrietta (Nettie) was the daughter of Leander J. McCormick, a brother of Cyrus. They named the estate &quot;Langley Park&quot; after the Goodharts&#x27; ancestral home in Kent, England. In 1924, they erected an , 28-room Georgian Revival mansion, designed by architect George Oakley Totten Jr., at a cost of $100,000. It remains a community landmark at 8151 15th Ave. CASA of Maryland purchased the property in 2009, making the site its home base, and a Multicultural Community Center is now open in the mansion. This property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 29, 2008.

During the late 1930s-early 1940s, Leander McCormick-Goodhart, son of Frederick and Nettie, served as personal assistant to Ambassador Lord Lothian and supervisor of American Relief to Great Britain through the British embassy. As a result, the Langley Park estate became a regular site of social activities related to the British embassy including hosting the regular games of the Washington Cricket Club and, in June 1941, a British Relief Country Fair.

The estate was first subdivided during and immediately after World War II, and was developed as a planned community by Pierre Ghent &amp; Associates of Washington, D.C. The last major section would be developed in 1963. Because of the wartime and immediate postwar demand for housing, the estate was quickly developed for low-rise apartment homes, semi-detached, and single family homes. Starting in 1949, a 1,542 garden apartment complex, Langley Park Apartments, now located along 14th Avenue, was built to house the exploding postwar population. That same year, M.T. Broyhill and Sons started building on a tract for 600 single family homes to be priced at around $10,000. These homes now lie north of Merrimac Drive. Both the apartments and homes were completed and occupied by June 1951. In 1951, plans were unveiled for 500 additional multi-family rental dwellings and a , $4 million shopping center.

In 1963, the last major segment of the Langley Park estate opened for development. It was a parcel located directly around the manor house. It had been acquired in 1947 from the McCormick-Goodhart family by the Eudist Order for use as a seminary. The property was acquired for $900,000 by developers, who built the 400-unit Willowbrook Apartments on the site and opened them the following year. The mansion then operated until the early 1990s as Willowbrook Montessori School.

The Langley Park Elementary School, now known as Langley Park-McCormick School, opened in 1950, at 15th Avenue and Merrimac Drive. In 1988, Leander McCormick-Goodhart, real estate developer and descendant of the estate owners, sent the school a $10,000 donation after receiving an invitation to attend a school event. That same year, 60 percent of the school population of 610 students was foreign born from 45 different countries and spoke 27 languages.

In 1955, Langley Park was &quot;the fastest growing trade area in Metropolitan Washington&quot;, with 200,000 people located within a radius. Affordable housing attracted a community consisting mostly of young couples with families. In the following decades, Langley Park became a white middle-class enclave that was mostly Jewish. By the 1960s, the Jewish community of Langley Park had already begun to decline.
During the 1970s, after desegregation, increasing numbers of African Americans moved into the community. Although some established families remained, the white population declined due to white flight to the outer suburbs. In 1970, the first language of 6.1 percent was Spanish; by 1980 that number had climbed to 13.4 percent. During the 1980s, Hispanic and Caribbean immigrants from countries such as El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Jamaica and elsewhere in the West Indies led a new wave of migration into the community. In addition, Asian and African immigrants from places like Vietnam, India, Ethiopia and Nigeria settled into the area. It proved to be an attractive locale for immigrants due to the availability of affordable housing that could also accommodate families. The integration of these new groups into Langley Park reflected a larger trend of increased migration to the Greater Washington area during the 1980s and 1990s. By 1990, the area was 40 percent Hispanic.

At the same time, the area suffered through a period of physical decline and increases in crime. During the 1980s, the community struggled with blighted residential and commercial areas. The apartment complexes experienced substantial turnover in occupancy. Residents in the 14th Avenue and Kanawha Street area in particular were subjected to &quot;open air drug markets&quot; and other criminal activity. Long-time residents and the new immigrant communities were both victims of crime. Some homeowners organized to address neighborhood concerns about rising crime. For the 1988–89 school year, bus service for children who lived in walking distance to school was implemented to ensure their safety. Police also increased their presence in the community. Apartment complexes, under new management, initiated safety measures to discourage drug activity such as installing new lighting, security doors and maintaining general upkeep of their properties. At the same time, police in Prince George&#x27;s County conducted multiple raids in an effort to shut down drug activity in the county. By 1991, officials were taking note of an increase in illegal immigrants from Central America, and day laborers were beginning to become a common sight on area streets.

==Geography==
Langley Park is located at (38.994060, −76.981759), with a total area of , all land. The community is bordered by University Boulevard to the south, the Northwest Branch Anacostia River to the north, Phelps Road to the east, and the Prince Georges County–Montgomery County line to the west. An extremely small stretch of Piney Branch Road (MD 320) which goes into Prince George&#x27;s County, goes into the Langley Park neighborhood as well, just before it crosses the Northwest Branch Anacostia River and intersects New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650). While most of the Langley Park neighborhood contains the Hyattsville ZIP Code of 20783, there is a small portion of Langley Park located west of New Hampshire Avenue (MD 650), but east of the Prince George&#x27;s County–Montgomery County line, which contains the Silver Spring ZIP Code of 20903. Langley Park is surrounded by the communities of Adelphi, Silver Spring, Takoma Park, Carole Highlands, and Lewisdale.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Chillum-Adelphi Volunteer Fire Department (CAVFD) serves Langley Park. The station is in Langley Park CDP and has an Adelphi postal address. In March 1951 and June 8, 1951, the CAVFD was established and chartered, respectively. From November and March 1953 the fire station on Riggs Road was constructed; the County Volunteer Firemen&#x27;s Association designated it Station No. 34. Portions of Station No. 34 were rebuilt in the early 1960s, and it was rededicated on November 16, 1963. In 1962 the CAVFD began building a substation, No. 44, which was dedicated on November 16, 1963, but in 1992 it sold the substation to the county government.

Prince George’s County Police Department&#x27;s District 1 serves Langley Park; its station is in Hyattsville.

The United States Postal Service Langley Park Post Office is physically in the City of Takoma Park and has a Hyattsville postal address.

===Transportation===
Two light rail stations on the Purple Line are being constructed to serve Langley Park. One station will be at New Hampshire Avenue and University Boulevard, which was named one of the most dangerous intersections in Maryland for pedestrians to cross. The danger is due to crossings of these six-lane routes mid-block at curbside bus stops. The other station will be located at University Boulevard and Riggs Road. The Purple Line, which will connect to the Washington Metro, Amtrak and MARC, is under construction as of 2022 and is scheduled to open in 2026.

==Economy==
Langley Park is probably best known as a center of commercial activity in northwestern Prince George&#x27;s County. At each of the two corners of the New Hampshire Avenue / University Boulevard intersection is a large strip shopping center. One is known as the Langley Park Plaza (northeast corner), while the other is known as the Langley Park Shopping Center (northwest corner). There are also three other small shopping centers a few blocks east of New Hampshire Avenue, two are located on the northeast and northwest sides of the intersection of University Boulevard and Riggs Road, while the third one is located at the intersection of University Boulevard and 15th Avenue.

==Education==
The Prince George&#x27;s County Public Schools (PGCPS) operates public schools. Langley Park-McCormick Elementary School is located in Langley Park. It had 679 students circa March 2013, with all but 12 living in Langley Park. In 2007 the school had 435 students. That year about 90% of the students at earlier grades were identified as learning English as a second language, and 370 students in all grade levels were Hispanic or Latino. Langley Park-McCormick entered into the Title I program due to the low income statuses of many of its students. Amy Stout became the principal in 2008 as former principal Sandra Jimenez, who started at Langley Park circa 2002, became the principal of Buck Lodge Middle School.

In 1987 the 611 students originated from 33 countries, with about 50% being born outside the United States; Central American and South American-born students made up the majority of that group. That year the students altogether spoke 17 languages. 95% of the students were Hispanic/Latino. In 2001, there were 750 students, with about 33% of them being in the &quot;English for Speakers of Other Languages&quot; (ESOL) program, and over 90% qualifying for free or reduced lunches. In 2001 it had five bilingual employees.

Other schools educating significant numbers of Langley Park students include Mary Harris “Mother” Jones Elementary School in Adelphi, Cool Spring Elementary School in Adelphi, Buck Lodge Middle School in Adelphi, Sonia Sotomayor Middle School in Adelphi, and High Point High School in Beltsville. In 2013 the percentages of four those schools&#x27; students living in Langley Park were 82% (for Jones), 72% (for Cool Spring), 32% (for Buck Lodge), and 23% (for High Point). In the 2012–2013 school year 2,669 Langley Park students attended Langley Park-McCormick, Jones, Cool Spring, Buck Lodge, and High Point; making up 92% of the public school students in the community; while 220 Langley Park students attended 52 other PGCPS Schools. Langley Park-McCormick, Adelphi, and Cool Spring elementaries had percentages of Hispanic students and students with free/reduced lunches higher than the average for PGCPS; Adelphi and Cool Springs each had over 56% of their students being Hispanic/Latino and about 50% being on free/reduced lunches. Sotomayor Middle opened in 2023.

Sections of the CDP north of Route 193 are assigned to Langley Park-McCormick, Jones, and Cool Spring; a section of the CDP south of Route 193 is zoned to Carole Highlands Elementary School. Carole Highlands has a Takoma Park postal address but is within the Langley Park CDP boundaries. As of the 1990 US Census and the 2000 US Census, Carole Highlands Elementary, as well as all of the areas south of Route 193, was in the Chillum CDP. Most of Langley Park CDP is within the zone for Sotomayor Middle while parts are in the zone for Buck Lodge Middle. All of the CDP is zoned to High Point High School.

In the 2011–12 school year 36% of 9th grade students from Langley Park, who attended High Point, did not go to school for at least 20 days per school year compared to 29% district average for 9th graders and 10% district average for 7th and 8th graders; the Langley Park 7th and 8th graders truancy rate was the same as the district average. Scott, et al. stated in a 2014 paper published by think tank The Urban Institute that a possible reason was that start time of High Point was the same as that of Buck Lodge Middle School even though the high school&#x27;s distance from Langley Park was longer than that of the middle school.

==Recreation==
Every year, Langley Park Day is held at Langley Park-McCormick Elementary. It has festivities as well as health screenings. It started in 1999. The school, Action Langley Park, the Prince George&#x27;s County Department of Parks and Recreation, and the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission sponsors Langley Park Day.

==In literature==
Langley Park of the early 1960s is featured in the short story &quot;Blue Divisions&quot; by Cuban-American author Alfredo Franco.

<text>Largo () is an unincorporated area and census-designated place in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The population was 11,605 at the 2020 census.

Largo is located just east of the Capital Beltway (I-95/495) and is home to Prince George&#x27;s Community College and Largo High School. Six Flags America amusement park (formerly known as Wild World and Adventure World) is to the east in Woodmore, and FedExField, the Washington Commanders&#x27;s stadium, is across the Capital Beltway in Summerfield. Watkins Regional Park in Kettering just to the east of Largo (operated by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission) has an old-fashioned carousel, miniature train ride, miniature golf, the Old Maryland Farm, a playground, and animals on display. Largo is not a post office designation, but is at the northern end of the Greater Upper Marlboro ZIP code area.

==History==
Largo was named after the Largo Plantation that was owned by the Beall family. The plantation is believed to be named after Largo Bay in Scotland. It was sold to John Contee in 1745.

Arelis R. Hernández of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated in 2015 that &quot;There has been talk for decades of relocating the [Prince George&#x27;s County] government to Largo&quot;. In 2015 Rushern Baker, the county executive, expressed a desire to move the county seat from Upper Marlboro to Largo since the latter has a more central location and access to the Washington Metro network. A spokesperson for Mike Miller, the President of the Maryland Senate, expressed opposition to this idea.

<doc id="116541" wikidata="Q755275" url="?curid=116541" title="Laurel, Maryland">
<text>Laurel is a city in Maryland, United States, located midway between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore on the banks of the Patuxent River, in northern Prince George&#x27;s County. Its population was 30,060 at the 2020 census. Founded as a mill town in the early 19th century, Laurel expanded local industry and was later able to become an early commuter town for Washington and Baltimore workers following the arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1835. Largely residential today, the city maintains a historic district centered on its Main Street.

The Department of Defense has a prominent presence in the Laurel area today, with the Fort Meade Army base, the NSA and Johns Hopkins&#x27; Applied Physics Laboratory all located nearby. Laurel Park, a thoroughbred horse racetrack, is located just outside the city limits.

==History==

===Natural history===
Many dinosaur fossils from the Cretaceous Era are preserved in a park in Laurel. The site, which among other finds has yielded fossilized teeth from Astrodon and Priconodon species, has been called the most prolific in the eastern United States. From the Late Glacial age in 10,700 B.C. to 8,500 B.C., Laurel&#x27;s climate warmed and changed from a spruce forest to a hardwood forest. In the Late Archaic period from 4,000 to 1,000 B.C., Laurel would have been covered primarily with an oak and hickory forest.

===Pre-20th century===
Laurel was formed from land on the fall line of the Patuxent River patented by the Snowden family in 1658 as part of the 12,250-acre New Birmingham plantation, which included the later Montpelier. The Washington Turnpike Road Company built Route 1 between 1796 and 1812, creating a major north–south land route. Milstead&#x27;s Hotel halfway house was built in town to serve four stage lines a day in 1816. Nicholas Snowden built a grist mill on the site circa 1811 which grew to a small cotton mill by the 1820s.
In 1828, a detailed survey was conducted to build a canal from Baltimore to Georgetown to connect to the proposed C&amp;O canal. The route from Elkridge Landing to Bladensburg would have built a waterway roughly aligning with modern U.S. Route 1 and Kenilworth Avenue, with special consideration not to harm the water power for Savage Mill. The project did not go forward; the preference was to build a railroad, the B&amp;O. Nicholas Snowden died in 1831, and the mill properties transferred to Louisa Snowden and her husband Horace Capon in 1834. In 1835, coinciding with the opening of the Capital Subdivision
rail line from Baltimore to Washington, the Patuxent Manufacturing Company was chartered by Horace Capon, Edward Snowden, Theodore Jenkins, W.C. Shaw, A.E. Hall, and O.C. Tiffany and the mill expanded greatly with the addition of the Avondale Mill building in 1844. Mill president Horace Capron with his partners built housing for close to 300 workers, and a bigger cotton mill. Cotton duck from the mill was shipped down what would become Laurel&#x27;s Main Street, then by rail to Baltimore. A substantial dam was built in 1850. As a mill town, Laurel was somewhat unusual in Prince George&#x27;s County and was surrounded by agricultural endeavors.

The community was originally known as &quot;Laurel Factory&quot;, named for its laurel trees, when Edward Snowden became the first postmaster in 1837 and was a true company town, with a school and shops, and many of the mill workers&#x27; homes owned until the 1860s by the company. During the 1840s, three historic churches in the community—the Methodist est. 1842, St. Mary of the Mills (Roman Catholic) est. 1845, and St. Philip&#x27;s (Episcopal) est. 1839—established what are still vigorous congregations. During the Civil War, Laurel Factory, like much of Maryland, was a divided community, but with many Southern sympathizers. Union soldiers patrolled the railroad, and for a time there was also a Union hospital. During the latter half of the 19th century, while it still operated its factories, manufacturing played a less important role in the community. Laurel evolved into an early suburban town. Many of its residents commuted by rail to jobs in Washington or Baltimore. The town was incorporated in 1870 and reincorporated in 1890 to coincide with a new electric power plant and paved streets and boarded sidewalks. By this time, the town had grown to a population of 2,080, and the city banned livestock from the streets.

In 1870, the Patuxent Bank of Laurel was founded on the corner of Main Street and Washington Avenue. In 1874 a delegation was sent to Annapolis to introduce legislation to make Laurel its own county of 10,000 residents with land from Prince George&#x27;s, Howard, and Anne Arundel counties. In 1879 Laurel Academy of Music was built along Route 1. The building was converted to a movie theatre in 1915, with a parking garage on the lower floor of the wood structure; it burned in 1917, and Academy Ford built on the same site in the late 20th century. In 1888 inventor David J. Weems tested an unmanned electric train on a two-mile banked circular track near Laurel Station. The three-ton vehicle reached speeds of up to 120 mph for twenty minutes.

In 1890, Citizens National Bank opened its doors on Main Street, as Prince George&#x27;s County&#x27;s first nationally chartered bank. Charles H. Stanley was the bank&#x27;s first president, and it remained independently managed and with the same name until acquired by PNC Financial Services in 2007. Branch services are still provided from the original building. Along with those branch services being provided, there have been an additional 5 branches that were implemented.

At the turn of the century, Louis Barret operated a hotel called the &quot;Half Way House&quot;, later called the Milstead Hotel, which served as a stop for the four stage lines operating between Baltimore and Washington. In 1898, a stable fire spread to the 100-year-old hotel and burned adjacent buildings along Main Street. With only bucket brigades, Mayor Phelps telegraphed Baltimore to send a special train with fireman, horses, and engine number 10. One fireman was crushed by the rolling fire engine, and returned in a casket saved from the burning mortuary. The resulting losses inspired efforts to bring water and fire apparatus to the town. The town was struck again by the great Laurel fire of December 14, 1899, when a twelve-building fire destroyed the Laurel Presbyterian Church (known then as Presbyterian Church at Laurel).

Proposed in 1897, Laurel&#x27;s seven-term mayor Edward Phelps succeeded in constructing the first high school in Prince George&#x27;s County in 1899, despite several financial obstacles, by personally assuming the financial risks in doing so. The original building built for $5,000, now known as the Phelps Community Center, still stands at the northeast corner of Montgomery and Eighth Streets. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

===20th century===
In 1902, the City and Suburban Railway with the City and Suburban and Washington, Berwyn, and Laurel railway started single line electric trolley service.
The Laurel Sanitarium was built in 1905 on a farm that comprised what is now Laurel Lakes. The facility&#x27;s purpose was to care for people with nervous diseases, alcohol, and drug addiction. Five buildings that were joined to a central administration building included 8-, 14-, 30-, and 36-room facilities for men and women.

Laurel Park Racecourse, a thoroughbred racetrack, opened in 1911 and remains in operation. In the book, &quot;&quot;, Laurel is mentioned several times as an important horse racing venue. Laurel also hosted a horse trotter (harness racing) track named Freestate Raceway from 1948 to 1990; it was located in Howard County on the west side of US Route 1, south of Savage in an area that now includes a CarMax dealership, Weis supermarket, and a strip mall.

In March 1912, the city agreed to take out $35,000 in loans to build its first sewer system with twelve miles of line that terminated by dumping into the Patuxent River.

In February 1913, Laurel was a stopping point in the Suffrage hike led by Rosalie Gardiner Jones. She was joined by a Laurel-based colored women&#x27;s suffrage group and sent a parcel with a flag and message ahead to President-elect Wilson.
Board track racing came to Laurel in 1925 when a wood oval track was built by Jack Prince and featured 48-degree banked turns. The Washington-Baltimore automobile speedway was short-lived, with featured races of 16 drivers at a time. Despite crowds of up to 30,000, receipts did not cover the $400,000 cost of building the track on the 364-acre Avondale property which fell into receivership in 1926.

Natural gas service was extended to the community in 1929.

In 1931, &quot;Angy Gerrin&quot; built a 7,000-seat amphitheater next to the Duvall Farm between Laurel Park and Route One for an outdoor boxing venue. His company, Mid City Boxing Club Inc, held several events with low turnouts and receipts confiscated by local police. It was sold the same year to C.E. Cornell, who called it &quot;Twin Cities Arena&quot; or &quot;Mid City Arena&quot;. The arena was active through 1932 with the entire delegation of the National Boxing Association attending a fight with Governor Ritchie in attendance. After watching the match and calling a fight to be halted in five rounds, the delegation announced efforts to drop junior lightweight and junior welterweight classes to discourage matches between young opponents. Operations ceased by the end of the 1933 season in the peak of the depression.

Prohibition in the United States was repealed in 1934. Wasting little time, the Prince Georges Brewing Company planned a $500,000 brewery on 100 acres next to Laurel Park, but did not follow through.

In 1954, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory built its campus west of Laurel in Howard County, using a Laurel address.

By 1960, Laurel anticipated massive growth from Fort Meade and NSA. The town still used the Patuxent River to drain sewage, and filed urban grants for water and sewage infrastructure. 5,000 houses were planned in the adjacent 1,200-acre Maryland City development. City Planner Harry Susini anticipated the National Capitol Planning Commission would use clustered development to prevent tightly massed population in Laurel by the year 2000.

In the late 1960s, the county was at the peak of racial tensions. The situation peaked in Laurel in July 1967 when four men and a juvenile, affiliated with the KKK, attempted to burn St. Mark&#x27;s United Methodist Church and then a private residence in the predominantly African-American neighborhood of the Grove, prompting protests and police blockades. Due to cross-burning incidents, a Ku Klux Klan march, and several arsons and suspected arsons, temporary police barricades were erected throughout late July to prevent white residents from entering the Grove. In August 1967, it was announced that the city would re-purchase a privately owned swimming pool, which had been sold to a private club in 1949. The pool, which had only been available to white residents, was to be operated as an integrated public facility open to all.

On May 15, 1972, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, running for the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party, was campaigning at a rally in the parking lot of Laurel Shopping Center, near what is today a Bank of America branch, when he was shot and paralyzed by Arthur Bremer, a disturbed, out-of-work janitor (see &quot;An Assassin&#x27;s Diary&quot;).

On June 22, 1972, Laurel was impacted severely by Hurricane Agnes, which caused the greatest flooding ever recorded in Maryland. Several bridges were destroyed and the nearby T. Howard Duckett Dam at Rocky Gorge Reservoir was at capacity and posed a huge threat. In 1975, the city council passed ordinances to create a historic district around Main Street.

In 1982, developer Kingdon Gould III bought 3,539 acres of Laurel property (539 in North Laurel) in two deals for $15 million. The largest parcel lies between Laurel and Beltsville and is being developed under the name Konterra, buoyed by access to major highways via the construction of Maryland Route 200.

The Elizabeth House, a nonprofit food pantry and soup kitchen, was founded in 1988 to serve low-income residents of the Laurel area. This later grew to include emergency financial aid and transportation.

A former 1840s mill workers&#x27; home on the northeast corner of 9th and Main Streets was renovated and opened as the Laurel Museum on May 1, 1996. The museum features exhibits that highlight the history of Laurel and its citizens. A gift shop is available, and museum admission is free. The museum&#x27;s John Calder Brennan Library is open to researchers by appointment.

===21st century===
On September 24, 2001, a tornado passed through Laurel and left F3 property damage, including significant roof damage to the Laurel High School and the historic Harrison-Beard building.

On August 29, 2005, Laurel adopted Laurel, Mississippi, as a sister city to help with Hurricane Katrina relief and recovery. In the two years following adoption, &quot;the government, businesses and residents of Laurel, Md. ... raised more than $20,000 for Laurel, Miss.&quot;

<text>Mitchellville is a majority African-American unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 11,136.

==History==
Mitchellville was named for John Mitchell (1788–1862), who owned Essington Hall, the plantation that encompassed much of the area. He and his wife Mary Lanham are buried in the Mitchell Family Cemetery on Mitchellville and Mount Oak Road. This location is now South Bowie, and the Bowie CDP 08775 
 An 1878 G.M. Hopkins Atlas shows &quot;Mitchellville P.O.&quot; near the same corner of what is today Mitchellville and Mount Oak Road. In its original cataloging the name and place &quot;Mitchellville&quot;, the USGS used the railroad guide &quot;Mitchellville (Mulliki&#x27;n) G. S. Owensville sheet Mitchellville P. G. 614 Mulliken R.&#x27;R. Guide, 314.&quot; as a basis in its decision card documentation where a Mullikin/Mitchellville railroad stop served also as the post office. This is also seen in other historic maps

The area was historically occupied by various farming families, who mainly raised tobacco and cattle on homesteads in the area. During the late 70s, the county&#x27;s desire to increase the desirability of Prince Georges&#x27; as a homestead for various professionals led to the rezoning of many tracts of land in the area. Between 1979 and 1995, much of the farmland in the area was redeveloped for residential and commercial use. 

As of 2010, the Census designated place (&quot;CDP&quot;) Mitchellville is no longer encompassing of the original Mitchellville, location of the old Essington Hall, but is drawn one CDP tract over on the west of the Woodmore CDP.
