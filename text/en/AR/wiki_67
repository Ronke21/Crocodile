<text>Chadron ( ) is a city and the county seat of Dawes County, Nebraska, United States, in the Great Plains region. The population was 5,206 at the 2020 census.

==Description==
Chadron also is the United States Forest Service headquarters of the Nebraska and Samuel R. McKelvie National Forests, and the Buffalo Gap, Fort Pierre, and Oglala National Grasslands. The Museum of the Fur Trade is located near Chadron, at the site of the American Fur Company&#x27;s former Bordeaux Trading Post.

==History==
Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years. In historic times, tribes such as the Oglala Lakota (Oglala Sioux Tribe), Cheyenne and others lived in the area. The Sioux used this territory as a hunting ground after pushing other tribes to the west.

Chadron is named for Louis Chartran, a French-Indian (Métis) fur trapper who ran a trading post on 
Chadron Creek in 1841. He was married to a Native American woman.

In 1884 the town was formally established when the Fremont, Elkhorn, and Missouri Valley Railroad was constructed through the area from Omaha, Nebraska, en route to Wyoming. Chadron was first named O&#x27;Linn for its founder Fannie O&#x27;Linn, who built a community at the confluence of the White River and Chadron Creek. This is where the railroad was expected to branch. When it was built six miles away on Bordeaux Creek, the townspeople packed up the entire town—buildings included—and moved it to the new location.

Among the founders of the town were the businessman Charles Henry King and his wife Martha. King established retail and freight businesses and banks in towns along the railroad&#x27;s route; he capitalized on the flow of settlers and pioneers to the region. Four of the five King children were born in Chadron, including their second son Leslie Lynch King. In 1908 the family moved to Omaha, the business center of the state. In 1912 Leslie married, and in July 1913 became the father of the future president, Gerald Ford. King and his wife divorced soon after that.

During the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, Chadron was the starting point of the 1,000-mile &quot;Chadron-Chicago Cowboy Horse Race.&quot; Nine riders competed for the $1,000 prize to be the first to reach the entrance of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show. Among the riders was the former outlaw Doc Middleton. John Berry won the race in 13 days and 16 hours.

In the Lakota language, Chadron is known as &quot;čhápa wakpá otȟúŋwahe&quot;, meaning &quot;beaver river city&quot;.

<text>Crawford is a city in Dawes County, Nebraska, United States, in the Great Plains region. The population was 997 at the 2010 census. It was incorporated in 1886 and was named for the late Captain Emmet Crawford, who had been stationed at nearby Fort Robinson.

==History==
The Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad reached Fort Robinson in 1886 on its way to Wyoming. Several miles east of the Fort, the railroad passed through a tree claim belonging to William Annin (also spelled &quot;Annon&quot;), who sold his claim for a new townsite. The &quot;tent city&quot; that sprang up around the railroad was named after Lt. Emmet Crawford, who had been formerly stationed at Fort Robinson but was killed in Mexico in January 1886.

The town&#x27;s original plat was filed on June 21, 1886 by the Western Townsite Company. E.A. Thompson and William D. Edger (editor of the original &quot;Crawford Clipper&quot;) circulated a petition for Crawford to become a village, but upon getting only 69 of the 200 needed signatures, secured the remaining signatures from willing soldiers at Fort Robinson. Crawford was incorporated in August 1886.

Seeking entertainment, the soldiers kept the town supplied with much business during its early years. Crawford was a very wild frontier town, and was home to many saloons and brothels. Calamity Jane came to Crawford from Deadwood, South Dakota with ten dancing girls and set up a tent south of town. Several murders took place in Crawford, most involving soldiers from Fort Robinson.

 A second railroad, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, reached Crawford in 1889, providing an additional boost to the community. In 1907 Crawford became a city, and by 1911 Crawford had the seventh-most business volume in Nebraska. Through the following years, the town had a variety of industries, including a brick works, mica mill, pickle factory, and a Nash Finch Company warehouse. Crawford lobbied for a state normal school, but the state decided to place the school (now Chadron State College) in nearby Chadron. The state thought that Crawford&#x27;s proximity to Fort Robinson would not be good for the school&#x27;s young women students.

The Elite Theater was established about 1910 in a converted saloon. The theater was owned and operated by Mrs. Georgianna Higgins, thought to be the first woman theater owner in the United States.

Crawford&#x27;s population peaked at 2,536 in 1910, largely because of the Kinkaid Act. It attracted many new settlers to western Nebraska who could claim public land for homesteading. But many found it impossible to successfully conduct dry-land farming on the 640-acre plots made available, and began to sell out to ranchers. The population of Crawford reflected that change and dropped to 1,646 by 1920. Businesses declined with the loss of customers. The town made some minor recovery, and the population was 1,845 in 1940. Because of urbanization and people seeking jobs, and the decline of family agriculture on the Great Plains, the population has been steadily decreasing since.

In the Lakota language, Crawford is known as &quot;oglíyotake otȟúŋwahe&quot;, or &quot;Return and Settle City&quot;.

<text>Cozad is a city in Dawson County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 3,977 at the 2010 census. The town is on the Great Plains of central Nebraska, along the Union Pacific Railroad and U.S. Route 30, just north of the Platte River. The 100th meridian, which roughly marks the eastward boundary of the arid plains, passes just west of the town as is marked nearby on a prominent sign across U.S. 30. In the early 1860s, the meridian was a stop along the Pony Express.

==History==
Cozad was founded in 1873 by John J. Cozad, murderer, gambler, Ohio native, and father of painter Robert Henri. Cozad was often regarded as immoral among the citizens of the early town.

<text>Newcastle is a village in Dixon County, Nebraska, United States. It is part of the Sioux City, IA–NE–SD Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 325 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Newcastle was incorporated as a village in 1893, soon after the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway was extended to that point. According to one tradition, it was named from a pioneer settler&#x27;s house that was known locally as the &quot;new castle&quot;.

Newcastle hosts a unique Labor Day celebration every year that garners many attendees. Activities include an afternoon parade, fire hose water fights and an old fashioned wheat threshing exhibit.

The township has long had a close history with the abandoned riverfront town Ionia. It is listed on the Nebraska Historical markers due to close campsites of Lewis &amp; Clark and reference to the Ionia volcano. The Ionia volcano is mentioned both by the explorers within their memoirs and local residents within the late nineteenth century county history publication “Dixon County History” published 1982.

Located near Newcastle is the Ionia Volcano, a mineral deposit that once sat in cliffs on the edge of the Missouri River.

<doc id="123870" wikidata="Q653613" url="?curid=123870" title="Fremont, Nebraska">
<text>Fremont is a city and county seat of Dodge County in the eastern portion of the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States. The population was 27,141 at the 2020 census, making it the 6th most populous city in Nebraska. Fremont is the home of Midland University.

==History==

From the 1830s to the 1860s, the area saw a great deal of traffic due to the Mormon Trail, which passed along the north bank of the Platte River. A ferry connected the two banks of the Elkhorn River near Fremont. It was a major overland route for emigrant settlers going to the West, the military and hunters.

Fremont was laid out in 1856 in anticipation that the railroad would be extended to that site. It was named after the American explorer, politician and military official General John C. Frémont. By 1857, there were 13 log houses in the town. The Union Pacific Railroad reached the town in December 1865 becoming the first railroad into the future rail hub. Sioux City and Pacific Railroad completed track into the town in 1868 with the Elkhorn Valley Railroad arriving in 1869.

Due to the town&#x27;s geographically central location, the First Transcontinental Telegraph line (1861), railroad (1865) and highway (1913) passed through or very near Fremont. Original brick portions of the &quot;Old Lincoln Highway&quot; are located east of Fremont, on the way to Omaha.

Fremont is the namesake for the Fremont neighborhood in Seattle, which was settled by Luther H. Griffith and Edward Blewett from Fremont.

On January 10, 1976, in downtown Fremont, the Pathfinder Hotel exploded due to a natural gas leak in the basement. At the time the hotel was being used as apartments, mostly occupied by senior citizens. It also was a meeting place for philanthropic and business organizations, and had a drug store on the northwest corner. The explosion shattered windows around the city, and the ensuing fire killed 23 people and destroyed most of the city block of the hotel.

Fremont gained national attention in 2010 when residents approved a referendum that would ban illegal immigrants from renting and working in the town. In addition, Fremont has a documented history of being a sundown town with a history of a sign featuring a racial epithet stating that people of African descent were not welcome in the town. This reputation was maintained through at least the 1970s. According to Tougaloo College, it is not known whether Fremont remains a sundown town.

<text>Hooper is a city in Dodge County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 857 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Hooper was established in 1871, following construction of the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad through the territory. It was named for Samuel Hooper, a US congressman from Massachusetts.

By the mid-1970s, the future of railroad service came into question. The Chicago &amp; North Western (C&amp;NW) (successor to the FE&amp;MV RR) tracks were experiencing mildly declining freight traffic levels. In spring of 1982, flooding from the Elkhorn River &amp; nearby Pebble Creek damaged the track. With the declining freight traffic levels &amp; flooding damage, the C&amp;NW promptly filed a request with the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon the line. Permission was granted later that year, leaving the tracks with a dismal future.

In 1986, railroad service was revived by the newly formed Fremont &amp; Elkhorn Valley Railroad (FEVR), which took ownership of the abandoned C&amp;NW track. However, a bridge north of Nickerson was deemed unsafe to cross in 2003; as a result, FEVR embargoed train service through Hooper. In summer 2021, the tracks were dismantled as part of an effort to construct a bike path following the old railroad route.

Hooper is noted for a obelisk, with the town&#x27;s name in letters, completed in 2010 as a road sign for the town.

<text>North Bend is a city in Dodge County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 1,177 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
North Bend lies on the north bank of the Platte River, at the intersection of U.S. Route 30 and Nebraska Highway 79. The main east–west line of the Union Pacific Railroad passes through the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The site of North Bend was settled in 1856 by a party of Scottish immigrants. En route from Lake Zurich, Illinois to Kansas, they stopped at a bend at the northernmost point of the Platte River, where they were invited to an impromptu Fourth of July celebration at a newly founded townsite named Emerson. Finding the site congenial, and concerned about the &quot;Border War&quot; in Kansas, they opted to remain there, founding a nearby townsite that they named Franklin.

The site grew with the arrival of new parties of settlers. One such party brought a steam-powered sawmill and meal-grinder, the first steam mill in Dodge County. In 1858, Emerson&#x27;s name was changed to Wallace, after a Philadelphia philanthropist who had offered to build a library in any town taking his name. In the 1860s, the town had a pontoon bridge across the Platte River allowing for trade with the farms to the south of the river making into the local grain market, a prime business opportunity for the incoming Union Pacific Railroad.

The combined townsite arrived at its present name in 1864, when the Union Pacific (UP) Railroad bought a piece of ground for a depot on the proposed transcontinental railroad. For many years, surveys had showed the town&#x27;s location as &quot;the north bend&quot; and was the northernmost point of the UP in the state of Nebraska. The residents and UP officials agreed on North Bend as the name for the town.

The first train arrived in North Bend in 1866, and the town was platted by the railroad in 1867. By 1876, the population had reached 250; there were 21 businesses, a school, and two churches. The city&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Independent&quot;, was founded in 1879.

Growth continued steadily. In 1890, the population reached 897; a city building was constructed. By 1920, North Bend had electricity, a waterworks, and paved streets; the population was 1,087. The town continued to grow through much of the 20th century, with its population reaching a peak of 1,368 in 1980.

<text>Scribner is a city in Dodge County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 857 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Scribner was platted in 1870 by Lucius D. Richards when the railroad was extended to that point. It was named for publishing magnate Charles Scribner I. Today, Scribner remains a town of trade, even though the railroad no longer serves the town.

By the mid-1970s, the future of railroad service came into question. The Chicago &amp; North Western tracks had been experiencing mildly declining freight traffic volumes. Revenue railroad service ultimately ended in spring of 1982, when flooding from the Elkhorn River &amp; nearby Pebble Creek damaged sections of the track. With freight traffic mildly declining &amp; flooding damage, the C&amp;NW promptly filed a request with the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon the line. Permission was granted a short time later, leaving the tracks with a dismal future. Plans were made to revive railroad service from the newly formed Fremont &amp; Elkhorn Valley Railroad, who purchased the abandoned C&amp;NW track. However, the costs were too high to revive railroad service, and the tracks were removed in 1988.

<text>Elkhorn is a western neighborhood of the city of Omaha, Nebraska, United States. The population was 6,062 at the 2000 census and was estimated by the Census Bureau at 8,192 in 2005 before it was annexed into Omaha in 2007. It was named after the Elkhorn River.

==History==
Elkhorn was platted in 1867 when the Union Pacific Railroad was extended to that point.

On April 26, 2024, Elkhorn was struck by a large, long-tracked EF4 tornado. Hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.

===Annexation===
Elkhorn, founded in 1865 by George Crawford and platted in 1867, was an independent municipality until it was annexed by the city of Omaha in 2005. In an attempt to prevent the annexation, Elkhorn almost simultaneously annexed several surrounding subdivisions in an attempt to bring the city&#x27;s population above 10,000 citizens; a 1917 state law limits Omaha&#x27;s annexation power to neighboring communities not over 10,000 in population. On January 12, 2007, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled in favor of Omaha, saying &quot;…we conclude that Elkhorn ceased to exist as a separate municipality on March 24, 2005, the date that Omaha&#x27;s annexation ordinance became effective.&quot; The United States Supreme Court denied Elkhorn&#x27;s request to hear the case on February 22, 2007.

Omaha Mayor Mike Fahey said he tried for years to work with Elkhorn, whereby Elkhorn would not be annexed if the city did no further annexing of its own. Elkhorn representatives did not consider that a fair proposal and refused. Omaha began the process of annexing Elkhorn. The two municipalities went to court as Elkhorn attempted to block the forcible annexation by Omaha. It was not until after losing the first round in the courts that Elkhorn offered to reach an agreement with Omaha. Omaha, having won in the courts and already financially invested in the court fights, refused to deal with Elkhorn and continued the annexation process.

The final Elkhorn city council meeting was held February 27, 2007. Elkhorn ceased to be an independent municipality on March 1, 2007.

<text>Exeter is a village in Fillmore County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 516 at the 2020 census.

==History==

In 1870, Dr. Horace Greeley Smith and his wife filed a homestead claim at the site of present-day Exeter. In an earlier scouting trip, Smith had determined that the site would lie near the line of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad as it extended itself westward.

In the fall of 1871, the Burlington and Missouri was completed through Fillmore County. To promote settlement along its line, the railroad established towns at intervals. Towns were named alphabetically as the railroad ran westward from Lincoln. In eastern Fillmore County, a town was established on land donated by Smith and by James Dolan. One of the families that had settled in the area had come from Exeter, New Hampshire, and it was proposed that the town be given that name. It was adopted, as being in keeping with the alphabetical sequence: Crete, Dorchester, Exeter, Fairmont, Grafton, Harvard, Inland, Juniata, Kenesaw, and Lowell.

The railroad advertised the availability of free government land in Nebraska, bringing settlers from the eastern United States, and Czech, German, English, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants. The town&#x27;s growth was initially slow, but hastened in the late 1870s. In 1878, two large grain elevators were built and a number of businesses opened; the town&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, was established in that year. In 1879, the town was incorporated; by that time, it had sixteen businesses.

Strang was first settled in 1886, and was known as Media. About a month later, it became known as Bixby because it was thought that Media sounded like too many other towns in the area. 
In April 1886, the settlement was renamed Strang after A. L. Strang donated a windmill and water pump to the town. That windmill still stands today in downtown Strang, on Main Street.
Around the turn of the century, fires ravaged the town. The two largest and most destructive fires occurred on October 10, 1899, and July 12, 1934. The fire of 1934 consumed one town block, including the post office, grocery store, cafe, and a residence.

==History==
In the spring of 1871, the Arapahoe Town Company was formed in Plattsmouth, Nebraska, under the leadership of Captain E. B. Murphy, for the purpose of establishing a settlement in the Republican River valley. The townsite was surveyed on July 18, 1871. It was named for the Arapaho tribe of Native Americans who occupied this area.

A post office was established in Arapahoe in 1872. A sawmill and gristmill were constructed on Muddy Creek, west of the town; the sawmill provided timber for early construction.

In 1873, Furnas County was organized by the state legislature, with Arapahoe designated as the county seat. The designation was challenged by Beaver City; an 1873 county election, followed by extensive litigation, moved the county seat to Beaver City in 1876.

The city&#x27;s first newspaper was the &quot;Pioneer&quot;, established in 1879. In 1882, the &quot;Arapahoe Public Mirror&quot; was established to support the Democratic Party in the county. The &quot;Public Mirror&quot; is still in operation; in 1924, it absorbed the &quot;Holbrook Observer&quot;. In 1978, it acquired the &quot;Elwood Bulletin&quot;, which it continues to publish under that name.

The Arapahoe Telephone Company was established in 1904. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, a WPA project constructed a swimming pool and solarium at the city park, which had been part of the city&#x27;s original layout.

<text>Beatrice () is a city in and the county seat of Gage County, Nebraska, United States. Its population was 12,261 at the 2020 census, making it the 15th most populous city in Nebraska. Beatrice is located approximately 42 miles south of Lincoln on the Big Blue River.

==History==
Gage County was one of the 19 counties originally established by the Nebraska Territorial Legislature in 1854. At the time of its establishment, there were no settlers living within its boundaries.

In 1857, the steamboat &quot;Hannibal&quot;, carrying 300 passengers up the Missouri River from St. Louis, Missouri to Nebraska City, Nebraska, ran aground near Kansas City, Missouri. While it was stranded, 35 of the passengers agreed to form the &quot;Nebraska Association&quot;, under which name they would unite in seeking a townsite and establishing a settlement in the territory.

After reaching Nebraska City, the Association divided itself into two exploratory parties, one of which went directly westward and the other southwest. The latter party located the site of Beatrice, at the point where the DeRoin Trail crossed the Big Blue River, and the whole Association decided to settle there. The settlement was named after Julia Beatrice Kinney, the 17-year-old daughter of Judge John F. Kinney, a member of the Association.

The Territorial Legislature selected Beatrice as the county seat of Gage County in 1857. The decision was challenged by Blue Springs, but was confirmed by the Legislature in 1859. In 1864, the Legislature dissolved the original Clay County (not the current Clay County, Nebraska), dividing its land between Gage and Lancaster Counties. The addition of this ground in the north placed Beatrice near the center of the enlarged county, strengthening its claim to the county seat. It continues to hold that position today.

===Homestead Act===
In 1862, the U.S. Congress passed the Homestead Act, which allowed settlers to claim of government land for a nominal fee. The law went into effect on January 1, 1863. Just after midnight on that day, Daniel Freeman persuaded a clerk to open the local Land Office so that he could file a claim for a homestead located west of Beatrice. His is regarded as the first of the 417 applications filed that day.

In 1936, Congress created Homestead National Monument of America on the site of Freeman&#x27;s claim.

===Early development===
The Big Blue River was both a help and a hindrance to the development of Beatrice. It provided the town with a water source, and produced ample power to operate the mills that were among the town&#x27;s first industries. However, it represented a major obstacle to travelers on the Oregon Trail route; and floods frequently destroyed the dams and bridges in the area. Not until 1890 was a Big Blue bridge built in Beatrice that could survive for decades.

In 1871, the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad constructed a line from Lincoln, Nebraska to Beatrice. In 1879, the Union Pacific Railroad built a line joining Beatrice to Marysville, Kansas. By 1890, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad had also run tracks through Beatrice.

On August 3, 1892, future president William McKinley, then governor of Ohio, gave a campaign speech in Beatrice.

The former international foods conglomerate, Beatrice Foods, (now a part of ConAgra Foods) was founded in Beatrice in 1894 as The Beatrice Creamery Company, by George Everett Haskell and William W. Bosworth.

===Beatrice State Developmental Center===
In 1885, the Nebraska legislature enacted legislation to establish the Institution for Feeble Minded Youth near Beatrice, subject to the city&#x27;s donating a suitable parcel of land. Beatrice donated 40 acres, located east of the city limits, and the first residents were admitted in 1887.

Over the following decades, the institution expanded greatly. By 1935, there were 1171 residents living on . The institution was largely self-supporting, operating a farm on which the residents did much of the work; in 1935, were under cultivation.

In 1945, the institution was renamed the Beatrice State Home. Its resident population peaked at about 2300 in the late 1960s. From there it declined: new restrictions had been imposed on the use of unpaid labor by residents of institutions, and there was a national trend toward deinstitutionalization. In 1975, the &quot;Horacek v. Exon&quot; lawsuit was settled with a consent decree whereunder many of the residents of the Beatrice State Home were transferred to community-based mental health facilities. In that year, the institution&#x27;s name was changed to the current Beatrice State Developmental Center.

A 2006 investigation by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services revealed a number of severe deficiencies at the Center; after two years of appeals, the Center lost its Medicaid certification in 2009.

As of 2011, the Center served about 175 clients. The majority had been diagnosed with &quot;severe&quot; or &quot;profound&quot; retardation; nearly all suffered from two or more other disabling conditions.

==In popular culture==
Beatrice is the setting for &quot;The Gallows&quot;, a 2015 found footage movie that was co-written, co-directed and co-produced by Chris Lofing, a graduate of Beatrice High School.

A popular story was circulated about a near-miss that occurred in Beatrice, when, at 7:25 pm on March 1, 1950, a church was destroyed by a natural gas explosion five minutes after a scheduled choir practice was to start, but no one was injured because all fifteen members were late, and thus not present at the time of the explosion. Snopes.com identified this as a true event. It was covered in an episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;.

In June 2022, HBO Max released a documentary series titled &quot;Mind Over Murder&quot; about the &quot;Beatrice Six&quot;, a group of acquaintances who were falsely convicted of a 1985 rape and murder that took place in Beatrice.

A 1970 science fiction novel &quot;The House in November&quot; by Keith Laumer takes place largely in Beatrice, Nebraska.

==History==
The area that would eventually become Liberty was being settled by whites as early as 1855. The town itself was founded by early settler David Palmer (1838-1876), who ran a trading post in the area. Palmer drowned in a nearby river and was buried in the Liberty Cemetery. The town also grew from the influx of railroad laborers who built the tracks that went through the village. In its heyday in 1890, Liberty had a population of 469, enough to support three grocery stores, a meat market, a livery, a dry goods store, a hotel, a law office, a hardware store, an undertaker, a lumber yard and barbershops, and its own newspaper, &quot;The Liberty Journal&quot;. But the money panic of 1893 hit the village particularly hard, and it never recovered from the shock of many farmers selling what they could and leaving town.

<text>Wymore is a city in Gage County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 1,377 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Wymore was platted in 1881 as a railroad town, on land donated by Sam Wymore. The &quot;Welsh Capitol of the Great Plains,&quot; Wymore became home to generations of immigrants from Wales, who continued their culture in day-to-day life, founding a Welsh-language church, school and cemetery, as well as preserving the Welsh traditions of poetry, dance, and intricate music in minor.

During the early 20th century, Wymore boasted an electric tram. However, by the 1980s the town&#x27;s population had shrunk and the railroads were used less. The train depot was burned down as part of a firefighting training exercise.

In 2000, the Wymore Welsh Heritage Project was founded to preserve the legacy of these early settlers. It has since expanded to include a museum, an archive of genealogical records, and one of the largest Welsh-language libraries in North America.

Wymore is home to Southern High School, a school that serves students from Barneston, Holmesville, Blue Springs, Wymore, and Liberty. The Raiders, competing in NSAA Class C-2, have won 2 state championships, both in wrestling (1974 and 1980). The Wymore Arbor State baseball ballfield has one of the few covered, behind-the-plate bleachers in the state.

Wymore is also the burial place of author and anthropologist R. Clark Mallam, whose book, &quot;Indian Creek Memories; A Sense of Place&quot; is set in and around the town.

<doc id="123937" wikidata="Q524112" url="?curid=123937" title="The Empress (tarot card)">
<text>The Empress (III) is the third trump or Major Arcana card in traditional tarot decks. It is used in card games as well as divination.

== Description and meaning ==
The Empress card in tarot is rich with symbolism and imagery that convey themes of fertility, nurturing, and abundance. She is typically depicted seated on a throne, signifying stability and power, often adorned with motifs underscoring her dominion over nature. Her crown of twelve stars represents her connection to the celestial realm and the zodiac, highlighting her universal influence.

The Empress holds a scepter, symbolizing authority and control over the natural world. A shield with the symbol of Venus by her side reflects her association with the goddess of love, beauty, and creativity, reinforcing themes of fertility and attraction. The lush landscape around her, featuring fields of wheat, rivers, and trees, symbolizes abundance and the nurturing aspects of nature.

Astrologically, the Empress is associated with Venus, enhancing her themes of harmony and nurturing. She is connected to the Earth element, emphasizing her grounding, life-giving qualities, and her role in the physical, material aspects of life. Numerologically, the Empress corresponds to the number three, signifying creativity, growth, and expansion, embodying synthesis and harmony.

In the esoteric tradition, particularly within the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, the Empress is linked to the sephirah of Binah and its path to Chokmah, representing understanding and the nurturing aspect of the divine feminine. Binah, as the Great Mother, gives form and structure to creation, further emphasizing the Empress&#x27;s role as a life-giving and nurturing force.

== History ==
The Empress card, one of the Major Arcana in tarot, has evolved significantly since its inception in 15th-century Europe. Initially part of tarot card games like &quot;tarocchi,&quot; the Empress was depicted as a regal figure, often crowned and enthroned, symbolizing power and authority.

During the Renaissance, tarot cards began to be associated with mysticism and astrology, with the Empress representing not only temporal power but also the nurturing mother archetype. This period blended classical and Christian symbolism, enriching the card&#x27;s imagery.

In the 18th century, figures like Antoine Court de Gébelin and Jean-Baptiste Alliette (Etteilla) reinterpreted tarot cards for divination, associating the Empress with the goddess Isis and Kabbalistic symbols. This esoteric tradition emphasized her role in creation and fertility.

In historical decks, the Empress sits on a throne, almost always holding a shield or orb in one hand and a scepter in the other. The shield typically bears an eagle, the heraldic emblem of the Holy Roman Empire. Arthur Edward Waite and the other occultists are responsible for the starry crown, the emblem of Venus, the waterfall, and the vegetation and wildlife. 

The 20th century saw the Empress&#x27;s symbolism refined in influential decks like the Rider-Waite deck, where she is depicted in a lush landscape, embodying nature, creativity, and nurturing.

== Interpretation ==
According to Waite&#x27;s 1910 book &quot;&quot;, The Empress is the inferior (as opposed to nature&#x27;s superior) Garden of Eden, the &quot;Earthly Paradise&quot;. Waite defines her as a — a fruitful mother of thousands: &quot;she is above all things universal fecundity and the outer sense of the Word, the repository of all things nurturing and sustaining, and of feeding others.&quot;

Waite writes that the card carries these several divinatory associations:

3. THE EMPRESS.--Fruitfulness, action, initiative, length of days; the unknown, clandestine; also difficulty, doubt, ignorance. Reversed: Light, truth, the unraveling of involved matters, public rejoicings; according to another reading, vacillation.

<doc id="123946" wikidata="Q2502757" url="?curid=123946" title="The Hierophant">
<text>The Hierophant (V), alternatively depicted as The Pope or The High Priest (as a counterpart to &quot;The High Priestess&quot;) is the fifth card of the Major Arcana in occult Tarot decks used in divination. It was identified as the Pope in early decks like Tarot of Marseilles, while modern decks like Rider–Waite Tarot may use the term hierophant (), a person who brings religious congregants into the presence of that which is deemed &quot;holy&quot;.

==Description and symbolism==
In many modern packs, the Hierophant is represented with his right hand raised in blessing or benediction, with two fingers pointing skyward and two pointing down, thus forming a bridge between Heaven and Hell reminiscent of that formed by the body of The Hanged Man. The Hierophant is thus a true &quot;pontiff&quot;, in that he is the builder of the bridge between deity and humanity. In his left hand he held a triple cross. His crown has three nails projecting from it, symbolizing the crucifixion of Jesus. The Hierophant is typically male, even in decks that take a feminist view of the Tarot, such as the Motherpeace Tarot, The Hierophant was also known as &quot;The Teacher of Wisdom&quot;.

In most iconographic depictions, the Hierophant is seen seated on a throne between two pillars symbolizing Law and Freedom or obedience and disobedience, according to different interpretations. He wears a triple crown, and the keys to Heaven are at his feet. Sometimes he is shown with worshippers, as his alternate title is the Pope or, sometimes, Jupiter. These are often a pair of tonsured priests. The card is also known as &quot;The High Priest&quot;, as a counterpart to &quot;The High Priestess&quot; (which itself is also sometimes known as &quot;The Papess&quot;, as counterpart to &quot;The Pope&quot;).

==History==
The papacy was not just a religious force, but was a political and military force as well. When the tarot was invented, the Pope controlled a large portion of central Italy known as the Papal States. Renaissance culture did not question the abstract ideal of the Pope as God&#x27;s human representative on Earth, but others involved in the religious Reformation of that Age would have disagreed. In Tarot of Marseilles, he wears a red cape and a blue robe, in contrast to The Papess, who wears a blue cape and red robe.

In occult circles, the more commonly encountered modern name &quot;Hierophant&quot;  is due to Antoine Court de Gébelin and was an attempt to dechristianise the standard French tarot pack, the Tarot de Marseilles, out of a mistaken belief of a pre-Christian origin. According to de Gébelin, &quot;hierophant&quot; was the title of the chief priest in the Eleusinian mysteries (an ancient Greek ritual). However, historical evidence shows that tarot cards were invented in Northern Italy in the first half of the 15th century and not in ancient Egypt.

==Interpretation==
The Hierophant stands for righteousness, sacredness, hierarchical order, orthodoxy, and moral righteousness. He is an exoteric figure, in contrast to the esoteric symbolism of The High Priestess. Reversed, the Hierophant can be interpreted as standing for unorthodoxy, originality, and gullibility.

According to A.E. Waite&#x27;s 1910 book &quot;Pictorial Key to the Tarot&quot;, the Hierophant card carries several divinatory associations:

5. THE HIEROPHANT.--Marriage, alliance, captivity, servitude; by another account, mercy, and goodness; inspiration; the man to whom the Querent has recourse. Reversed: Society, good understanding, concord, over kindness, weakness.

In astrology, the Hierophant is associated with the feminine, fixed-earth sign of Taurus and its ruling planet, Venus.

<text>Grand Island is a city in and the county seat of Hall County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 53,131 at the 2020 census, making it the 4th most populous city in Nebraska. Grand Island is the principal city of the Grand Island metropolitan area, which consists of Hall, Merrick, and Howard counties. The Grand Island metropolitan area has an official population of 83,472 residents.

Grand Island has been given the All-America City Award four times (1955, 1967, 1981, and 1982) by the National Civic League.

Grand Island is home to the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center, which is the sole agency responsible for training law enforcement officers throughout the state, as well as the home of the Southern Power District serving southern Nebraska. Ammunition manufacturer Hornady is also located there.

==History==

===19th century===
In 1857, 35 German settlers left Davenport, Iowa, and headed west to Nebraska to start a new settlement on an island known by French traders as &quot;La Grande Isle&quot;, which was formed by the Wood River and the Platte River. The settlers reached their destination on July 4, 1857, and by September had built housing using local timber. They set up farms but initially had no market to sell their goods until a market opened at Fort Kearny. When the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush began, Grand Island was the last place travelers could obtain supplies before they crossed the plains.

Surveyors from the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) laid out a town called Grand Island Station and many settlers living on Grand Island moved to the new town, located slightly inland from the island. In 1868 the railroad reached the area, bringing increased trade and business. Grand Island became the end of the east division of the railroad and UP built service facilities for their locomotives in the town as well as an elegant hotel for passengers providing a boost for the local economy. The cost of the railroad coming into town was the denudement of most of the hardwood trees on the island for use as ties for the railroad. By 1870, 1,057 people lived in the town, and in 1872 the town was incorporated as Grand Island.

In about 1890, sugar beets were introduced as a crop in Nebraska. The first sugar beet processing factory in the United States was built in the southwest part of Grand Island. By 1900, it was the state&#x27;s third largest city.

===20th century===
Throughout the 20th century, Grand Island experienced steady growth due to its strategic location along the railroad. The city remained Nebraska&#x27;s third largest city throughout the entire century, before being surpassed by Bellevue in 2000.

===21st century===
Grand Island has experienced a number of revitalization efforts in the 21st century. These include several expansions to the city&#x27;s airport, as well as the relocation of the Nebraska State Fair to Grand Island.

===1980 tornadoes===
On June 3, 1980, Grand Island was hit by a massive supercell storm. Through the course of the evening, the city was ravaged by seven tornadoes, the worst of which was rated F4 on the Fujita Scale. The hardest hit area of town was the South Locust business district. There were five deaths as a result of the tornadoes.

Tornado Hill is a local landmark created as a direct result of the tornadoes. Debris that could not be recycled was burned near Fonner Park and what remained was buried within Ryder Park, on the west end of town. The base of the hill was a hole deep and nearly across, and the hill is high. It is used for sledding in this otherwise flat area.

A book, &quot;Night of the Twisters&quot;, by Ivy Ruckman, and movie were based on this event.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Grand Island is located just a few miles north of the Platte River, one of Nebraska&#x27;s most prominent rivers on which many of the state&#x27;s major cities and towns sit.

===Metropolitan area===
The Grand Island Metropolitan Statistical Area consists of Hall, Hamilton, Howard, and Merrick counties. Hamilton was added to the metropolitan area in 2012. The Grand Island MSA is home to 76,479 people (2023 estimate), making it one of the smallest in the United States.

===Climate===
===Environmental issues===
In 1981, a plume of contaminated groundwater was discovered beneath the Cornhusker Army Ammunition Plant, which occupies west of Grand Island. The plume extended northeast of the plant and migrated towards Grand Island. Hazardous level of RDX and TNT were discovered, remnants of the explosives produced at the plant during various wars. In 1987, the Army burned about 40,000 tons of explosives-contaminated soil. In 1998, a pump-and-treat facility that continues to operate was built to cycle contaminated water through an explosives residue-removal system. The Army injected &quot;hot spots&quot; of contamination substances to curtail the contamination. , TNT and RDX were still present. Construction of a primary water detention cell for flood control has been delayed by the slow cleanup.

The Stuhr Museum, also known as the Museum of the Pioneer Prairie, is a museum located in southwestern Grand Island. The museum houses over 140,000 artifacts from early settlers in central Nebraska, and features a living history village called Railroad Town. Railroad Town is designed to evoke an 1890s-era prairie village and made up of many original period structures moved to the museum.

==Parks and recreation==
There are several parks located within Grand Island. The most prominent of these include Stolley Park, and the George Clayton Hall County Park.

==Government==
Grand Island has a mayor–council government. The mayor and a ten-member city council are elected in nonpartisan elections. Two members are elected from each of the city&#x27;s five wards to staggered four-year terms. At the most recent mayoral election, incumbent Mayor Roger G. Steele was re-elected to a second term.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

====Major highways====
Interstate 80 is located four miles south of the city. U.S. Route 281 is the main north-south route in the city, running through the city&#x27;s west edge south to Hastings, and north to O&#x27;Neill. U.S. Route 30 runs east-west through the center of Grand Island.

====Airport====
Central Nebraska Regional Airport is located in Grand Island. On September 4, 2008, Allegiant Air began nonstop service from Grand Island to Las Vegas, Nevada. In June 2011, American Eagle Airlines began providing service to Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, twice daily.

Intercity buses operated by Burlington Trailways and Express Arrow serve Grand Island.

The city&#x27;s transit system is entirely demand-responsive, with rides requiring reservation 24 hours in advance. As of 2023, Grand Island is the largest city in Nebraska without fixed-route public transit. Fixed route service was studied, but not recommended, in the GO Grand Island Transit 2023 Transit Development Plan.

Grand Island also sports a total of fifteen traffic circles, many of which are within close proximity to each other. This system allows for particularly efficient through-traffic while sacrificing speed and barring transportation to some locations by certain, longer vehicles. Of these fifteen recorded roundabouts, fourteen are designated &quot;official,&quot; while one is reportedly an &quot;unofficial&quot; insertion into the Grand Island&#x27;s public transportation network.

===Hospitals===

<text>Giltner is a village in Hamilton County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 352 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==Naming history==
In 1886, the Lincoln Land Company purchased land in the Union township. The Lincoln Land Company&#x27;s business was to purchase land along the railroad and develop towns along the line. In May, a town was platted and named &quot;Huntington&quot;, after an employee&#x27;s home town in Pennsylvania.

In February 1887, the post office asked that the town&#x27;s name be changed, due to the original name&#x27;s similarity to Hartington, Nebraska. The town was accordingly given the name &quot;Bromfield&quot;. By 1890, there was a local newspaper called the &quot;Bromfield Bulletin&quot;, as well as a number of stores and services, a lumberyard, two grain elevators, a school, a saloon and a church. At this time, the population of Bromfield was just under 200 people.

The town was renamed again in 1895, again at the request of the post office, and again because of its similarity to that of another town: Bloomfield, Nebraska. The new name was chosen to honor H. M. Giltner, the minister who had established the town&#x27;s Presbyterian church.

==Baseball==
Giltner was home to minor league baseball. In 1903, the Giltner team played as charter members of the short–lived Central Nebraska League, an Independent level five-team league. The Central Nebraska League folded after the 1903 season.

<text>Alma is a city in Harlan County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 1,133 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Harlan County.

==History==
Alma was founded in the spring of 1871 by a group of Union Pacific railroad laborers originally from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Harlan County was created by the Nebraska Legislature on June 3, 1871, and Alma was made the county seat on July 3, 1871. A dispute among the original settlers led to a dissolution of the town, but it was re-organized in 1874.

Alma&#x27;s status as county seat was challenged by residents of Orleans, but an 1884 Nebraska Supreme Court decision affirmed Alma&#x27;s status as seat of Harlan County. Alma officially incorporated in July 1881. The town was named after a daughter of one of the early settlers.

On January 13, 1880, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad reached Alma, providing a significant boost for local commerce and industry. In 1887, the Kansas City and Omaha Railroad also reached Alma. Telephone service reached Alma in June 1899. Electricity arrived with a steam power plant in 1906 and water service followed in 1907.

In 1935, major flooding of the nearby Republican River provided an impetus to build a dam on the river. The Army Corps of Engineers started construction of the Harlan County Dam on August 1, 1946, and completed work in November 1952. The lake thus created, Harlan County Reservoir, became one of Alma&#x27;s top recreation destinations.

During World War II, Alma hosted a small number of captured German prisoners of war who were interned at Camp Atlanta in neighboring Phelps County and who were employed for farm work and other tasks in Harlan County.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Alma is located at the junction of U.S. routes 136 and 183, at the northwest end of the Harlan County Reservoir.

==Sanctuary City for the Unborn==
On April 6, 2021, Hayes Center became the first city in Nebraska to outlaw abortion by local ordinance, declaring itself a &quot;sanctuary city for the unborn.&quot; The ordinance declares abortion to be &quot;a murderous act of violence that purposefully and knowingly terminates a human life,&quot; and it outlaws abortion &quot;at all times and at all stages of pregnancy.&quot; The only exception is for abortions performed &quot;in response to a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy&quot; that &quot;places the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.&quot; The Hayes Center ordinance also declares abortion-inducing drugs to be contraband.

The city of Blue Hill, Nebraska followed suit and enacted a similar ordinance outlawing abortion on April 13, 2021.

Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, (R) has praised Hayes Center for its actions to outlaw abortion, issuing a statement that: &quot;Nebraska is a pro-life state, and communities are working to recognize and protect innocent life in a variety of ways. The Biden-Harris Administration is pushing a radical, pro-abortion agenda, and Nebraska must do everything we can to stand against the abortion lobby.”

<text>St. Paul or Saint Paul is a city in and the county seat of Howard County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 2,290 at the 2010 census.

St. Paul is part of the Grand Island, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
St. Paul was founded by two young surveyors, James N. and Nicholas J. Paul, who had been surveying in Nebraska and the surrounding areas as the land opened to settlers. Struck by the beauty and the prospects of the Loup valley, they took out homesteads, successfully petitioned the state legislature to form a new county to be known as Howard County, and laid out the townsite. They brought the first settlers to the county in March 1871 and established the seat of government in St. Paul. Stillman Hazeltine put up the first building for a general store and town hall in the summer of 1871. That first building burned a few years later and the brick building which replaced it is still in use with his name and date 1871 on the front.

When the town was to be named, a committee collected the suggested names in a hat and the name Athens was drawn. Since an Athens already existed in the state, Nebraska Senator Phineas W. Hitchcock suggested the name St. Paul in honor of the Paul brothers who founded it. It officially became the county seat by vote in 1874 and was incorporated in 1881. The first mayor was E.F. Clapp.

During its first twenty years, Howard County was a typical western frontier with covered wagons, cowboys, huge cattle herds, rowdy railroad construction gangs, and Army detachments stationed within its borders. As settlers and the railroad extended north and west, the town of St. Paul served as an important trade center and quickly grew to a population of 2,000 residents. From 1882 until 1917, St. Paul was the home of Frank Iams, the nation&#x27;s largest importer of European draft horses. Three-star General C.S. Irvine set record-shattering, long-distance flights in a B-29 shortly after World War II. Herbert Paul was Adjutant General of the Nebraska National Guard for 19 years.

St. Paul had a broom factory, canning factory, brick factory, cigar factory, two flour mills, hatchery and more. Through the years innovation like the first self-rising flour was developed at one of the flour mills. The first chicken hatchery in Nebraska started in Cushing in 1901, moved to St. Paul in 1922, and operated until 1956. Pirus, a cure for many kidney and liver ailments, was invented in St. Paul. Dorothy Lynch invented her famous salad dressing in St. Paul, which is now sold nationally.

Grover Cleveland Alexander, who was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, was born on a farm in the area and retired to St. Paul at the end of his sports career. The American Legion baseball field was dedicated on June 15, 1971, and named after Alexander. Each year St. Paul honors Alexander with the celebration of Grover Cleveland Alexander (GCA) Days, the weekend following the 4th of July.

<text>Daykin is a village in Jefferson County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 157 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Daykin was founded by John Daykin, a train conductor and stonemason from Illinois. In 1869, John Daykin purchased land in Jefferson County, Nebraska that would later become Daykin. Besides founding the town, he remains most recognized for conducting the train that returned Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s body to Springfield, Illinois.

Daykin at one point had a population that reached near 300 people. The town held businesses such as a doctor&#x27;s office, a butcher, laundromat, veterinarian, hotel, blacksmith, furniture store, jewelry store and many more. The Jefferson County Bank was built in 1887, and has been in continuous operation since then, surviving the market crash of the 1930s.

The former Daykin Public School was held in the present day Daykin Community Building after its erection in 1935. The Daykin Schools became a 12 grade system in 1926. Most of the original 1935 building structure remains, with the lower elementary class buildings being moved and the gym being minimized after a restoration. Today students attend Meridian School. Meridian consist of the residents of Daykin, Fairbury, Western, Alexandria, and Tobias, creating the 303 Nebraska School District.

Two churches are located within Daykin, St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church, and St. John&#x27;s United Methodist Church. The Daykin Immanuel Church is a few miles outside of Daykin. Both churches were created in 1888.

Daykin is known as the &quot;Windmill Town&quot;. In the 1930s Daykin was featured in Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not, as having more windmills per capita than any other town in Nebraska. In 1949, a water tower was built. It replaced all but one windmill, which now stands on the lawn in front of the Daykin Community Building as reminder of Daykin&#x27;s history.

<text>Fairbury is a city and county seat of Jefferson County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 3,942 at the 2010 census.

Fairbury has been closely connected with railroading for much of its history. It was founded on the projected route of a railway, and grew as a shipping center. For nearly 80 years, it was the location of the Western Division headquarters of the Rock Island Railroad. Fairbury prospered with the Rock Island, and lost business and residents as the railroad declined.

==History==

===19th century===
In 1868, James B. Mattingly, a freighter originally from Kentucky, established a sawmill on the banks of the Little Blue River. Shortly thereafter, Woodford G. McDowell, a capitalist from Fairbury, Illinois, came to Nebraska to plat a town along the route of the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad, which was to follow the Little Blue. In 1869, Mattingly and McDowell each contributed for a new townsite, which they named after McDowell&#x27;s hometown.

The new town grew rapidly, even before the railroad&#x27;s arrival. In 1870, a population of 370 was reported; in that year, the &quot;Fairbury Gazette&quot; was established. A year later, Fairbury was chosen as the county seat; in early 1872, the city was incorporated. By this time, its businesses included three hotels and five blacksmith shops.

In 1872, the St. Joseph and Denver City reached Jefferson County. (The railroad was subsequently acquired by the Union Pacific and operated as the St. Joseph and Grand Island branch.) Fairbury became a shipping center: in the first half of 1873, it shipped 255 cars of grain and received 143 of lumber. By 1874, there were 600 residents; 44 businesses operated in the city.

An 1879 fire, &quot;supposed to have been the work of an incendiary&quot;, destroyed an estimated fourteen buildings, for a loss of $50,000, much of it uninsured. However, recovery was swift, and many of the destroyed frame buildings were replaced by more modern brick and stone structures. By 1882, the city&#x27;s population had grown to 1,600.

In 1885, the Campbell Brothers Circus began wintering in Fairbury. It continued to winter in and around the city until its closing in 1913. At its peak, the circus was the second-largest in the world.

In 1886, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad reached Fairbury. The city lay at the junction of the Rock Island&#x27;s north-south and east-west lines; because of this, it was designated the headquarters of the railroad&#x27;s Western Division. An extensive rail yard was constructed, including shops, storage and maintenance facilities, switching yards, and an 18-stall roundhouse. The railroad had a major impact on Fairbury: by 1890, the population had grown to 2,630.

The brick courthouse had survived the fire of 1879; but soon thereafter, it proved too small to handle the county&#x27;s increasing business and store its growing records. In 1882, the county began renting the top two floors of the newly constructed Opera House, and moved its offices there; but this too was quickly outgrown. In 1889, a $60,000 bond issue for the construction of a new courthouse passed; the new Romanesque Revival building was completed in 1892.

Fairbury continued to prosper as the home of the Rock Island headquarters, which employed many locals directly and in supporting businesses. Commercial and residential development continued apace in Fairbury. Both of the city&#x27;s banks survived the Panic of 1893. Boardwalks were replaced with brick sidewalks between 1892 and 1894; an electricity and waterworks powerhouse was constructed in 1895; and in 1898, electric street lights were installed. By 1900, the population had reached 3,140.

===20th century===
The decade from 1900 to 1910 saw the largest growth in Fairbury&#x27;s history; the census of 1910 reported a population of 5,294, representing a sixty percent increase over the ten years.

A major fire in 1903 swept the commercial district, destroying almost the entire block south of the courthouse square; the only building to survive was the original brick courthouse. Within a year, however, the entire block had been rebuilt.

In 1909, E. J. Hested opened his dime store, The Fair Store, in one of the new buildings. Two years later, the name of the store was changed to Hested&#x27;s. In 1925, the store moved into a new and larger building; the business expanded to over 150 stores in the Midwest and Mountain States before its acquisition by the J.J. Newberry chain in 1969.

The 1910s and 1920s were the peak years for the Rock Island Railroad, with fourteen passenger trains passing through Fairbury daily, and with hundreds of Fairbury residents on the payroll. To accommodate this traffic, the railroad constructed a new depot, at a cost of $40,000. The city&#x27;s commercial district underwent a considerable expansion, including two movie theaters and several large retail stores. In 1915, civic leaders began promoting the brick paving of Fairbury&#x27;s downtown streets; by 1930, there were of paved road. The 1920s and 1930s saw a proliferation of automobile-related businesses, such as garages, gas stations, and repair shops.

Fairbury was better situated than many communities to weather the Great Depression. Beside the railroad, it had a variety of industries, including the Fairbury Windmill Company, with a payroll of 50 people in 1930. The city continued to grow through the Depression, despite the difficulties of the Rock Island, which went into receivership in 1933 and did not emerge until 1948. The population of Fairbury peaked in 1950, at 6,395 residents.

The conversion of the Rock Island to diesel locomotives, completed by 1952, rendered portions of the Fairbury yards obsolete. The decrease in passenger railway traffic after World War II led to the reduction of service, the closing of stations, and the abandonment of track. In 1965, the Rock Island&#x27;s Chicago-to-Denver &quot;Rocky Mountain Rocket&quot; train ceased to run through Fairbury; in that same year, the railway relocated its Western Division headquarters from Fairbury to Des Moines, Iowa. 1965 was also the last year in which the Rock Island reported a profit. In 1975, it again entered receivership. A 1979 strike, unsuccessfully mediated by President Jimmy Carter, was the final nail in the railroad&#x27;s coffin. The railroad&#x27;s routes were operated for 60 days by the Kansas City Terminal Railway, to allow shipping of the 1979 Midwestern harvest; but in 1980, service to Fairbury ceased, and the depot was abandoned.
