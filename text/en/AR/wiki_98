In 1800, Isaac V. Coursen named the Stillwater Township area &quot;Coursen&#x27;s Corners&quot; after establishing a post office in his store, the Coursen House, but changed the name to Fredon Village before his death in 1855. Stillwater Township&#x27;s Bicentennial Committee obtained information from the Postmaster General which &quot;states that &#x27;Fredon&#x27; is derived from the German word &#x27;fredonia,&#x27; meaning place of freedom.&quot; Fredon Township was incorporated on February 24, 1904, from portions of Andover Township, Green Township, Hampton Township and Stillwater Township.

<text>Green Township is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 3,627, an increase of 26 (+0.7%) from the 2010 census count of 3,601, which in turn reflected increase of 381 (+11.8%) from the 3,220 counted in the 2000 census.

== History ==
On November 20, 1824, the southern portion of Sussex County was set off to create Warren County. The northern portions of both Hardwick and Independence townships, remained in Sussex County and were incorporated as Green Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on December 27, 1824.

In 1829, part of Green Township were transferred to Byram Township, and in 1853 Green Township was expanded to include a section of the old Newtown Township. On February 24, 1904, Fredon Township was incorporated from a portion of the township. In 1881, the area was listed as ; and today Green encompasses . The township was named after Ephraim Green, who settled near Greendell in 1770. Many sections of Green retain their own unique identity, such as Tranquility, Huntsville, Greendell and Yellow Frame.

Tranquility was originally known as Kennedytown, named for Amos Kennedy who settled here. When the location for the Tranquility Methodist Church was being chosen, a disagreement arose over erecting it in Allamuchy Township or Kennedytown. A compromise was affected, with the church being erected halfway between the two points. To memorialize the agreement, the church was named Tranquility. Later, Kennedytown took the church&#x27;s name as its own.

In 1911, the Lackawanna Cut-off rail line opened through Green Township, with a stop at Greendell station. The Cut-Off was part of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad&#x27;s mainline from Hoboken to Buffalo. The line was abandoned in 1980 and the tracks were removed four years later. New Jersey Transit is considering reactivating passenger service on the line extending to Scranton, Pennsylvania, with a proposed maintenance-of-way facility at Greendell that would incorporate the surviving station building.

In August 2006, a documentary titled &quot;The History of Green Township&quot; was produced by Kelsey Falkowski. The video includes historical landmarks, interviews with lifelong citizens of Green Township, and leads up to the contemporary view of the township. Copies can be obtained through the Green Township Historical Society.

The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council is comprised of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Hamburg is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

<text>Sir John Cavendish ( – 15 June 1381) was an English judge and politician from Cavendish, Suffolk, England. He and the village gave the name Cavendish to the aristocratic families of the Dukedoms of Devonshire, Newcastle and Portland.

==Biography==
John Cavendish was descended from the Norman noble Robert de Guernon, who lived during the reign of Henry I and who gave a large amount of property to the Abbey of Gloucester. A little later a son of a Robert de Gernon, Roger de Gernon, of Grimston Hall, in Trimley St Martin, Suffolk, married the heiress of John Potton of Cavendish and obtained a landed estate in the lordship and manor of Cavendish. In consequence, his four sons exchanged their father&#x27;s name for that of the estate each inherited. Until about 1500, this family are recorded as Gernon &quot;alias&quot; Cavendish.

Sir John Cavendish married Alice de Odingsells, became a lawyer and was appointed as a Justice of the Common Pleas in 1371 and Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench in 1372. He had one son, Andrew, who succeeded his father in the manor of Overhall, together with the advowson of Cavendish church, and the Suffolk manor of Fakenham Aspes. 
On 15 June 1381, he was killed during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt at Bury St Edmunds.

<doc id="125745" wikidata="Q810953" url="?curid=125745" title="Battersea Power Station">
<text>Battersea Power Station is a decommissioned coal-fired power station located on the south bank of the River Thames in Nine Elms, Battersea in the London Borough of Wandsworth. It was built by the London Power Company (LPC) to the design of Leonard Pearce, Engineer in Chief to the LPC, and CS Allott &amp; Son Engineers. The architects were J. Theo Halliday and Giles Gilbert Scott. The station is one of the world&#x27;s largest brick buildings and notable for its original, Art Deco interior fittings and decor.

The building comprises two power stations, built in two stages, in a single building. Battersea A Power Station was built between 1929 and 1935 and Battersea B Power Station, to its east, between 1937 and 1941, when construction was paused owing to the worsening effects of the Second World War. The building was completed in 1955. &quot;Battersea B&quot; was built to a design nearly identical to that of &quot;Battersea A&quot;, creating the iconic four-chimney structure.

&quot;Battersea A&quot; was decommissioned in 1975. In 1980 the whole structure was given Grade II listed status; &quot;Battersea B&quot; shut three years later. In 2007 its listed status was upgraded to Grade II*. The building remained empty until 2014, during which time it fell into near ruin. Various plans were made to make use of the building, but none were successful.

In 2012, administrators Ernst &amp; Young entered into an agreement with Malaysia&#x27;s S P Setia and Sime Darby to develop the site to include residential, bars, restaurants, office space (occupied by Apple and others), shops and entertainment spaces. The plans were approved and redevelopment commenced a few years later. The main Power Station building was opened to the public in October 2022.

As of 2023, the building and the overall site development is owned by a consortium of Malaysian investors.

The station is also notable for its appearance on the cover of rock band Pink Floyd&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;Animals&quot; (1977).

== History ==
Located on the south bank of the River Thames, in Nine Elms, Battersea, an inner-city district of South West London, the building comprises two power stations, built in two stages in a single building. Battersea A Power Station was built in the 1930s and Battersea B Power Station, to its east, in the 1950s. They were built to a near-identical design, providing the four-chimney structure.

The power station was decommissioned between 1975 and 1983 and remained empty until 2014. It was designated as a Grade II listed building in 1980. In 2007 its listed status was upgraded to Grade II*.

The station is one of the world&#x27;s largest brick buildings, and notable for its original, lavish Art Deco interior fittings and decor. The structure remained largely unused for more than 30years after its closure; in 2008 its condition was described as &quot;very bad&quot; by English Heritage, which included it in its Heritage at Risk Register. The site was also listed on the 2004 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.

Since the station&#x27;s closure, redevelopment plans have been drawn up by successive site owners. In 2004, when a redevelopment project by Parkview International stalled, the site was sold to the administrators of Irish company Real Estate Opportunities (REO), who bought it for £400million in November 2006 with plans to refurbish the station for public use and build 3,400 homes on the site. This plan fell through due to REO&#x27;s debt being called in by the state-owned banks of the UK and Ireland. The site was again put up for sale in December 2011 through commercial estate agent Knight Frank. The combination of an existing debt burden of £750million, the need to make a £200million contribution to an extension to the London Underground, requirements to fund conservation of the derelict power station shell, and the presence of a waste transfer station and cement plant on the river frontage made commercial development of the site a significant challenge.

Until the late 1930s, electricity was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations dedicated to a single industry or group of factories, and sold any excess electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency. In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should be a single system with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company (LPC). They planned to heed parliament&#x27;s recommendations and build a small number of very large stations.

The London Power Company&#x27;s first of these super power stations was planned for the Battersea area, on the south bank of the River Thames in London. The proposal was made in 1927, for a station built in two stages and capable of generating 400megawatts (MW) of electricity when complete. The site chosen was a plot of land which had been the site of the reservoirs for the former Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company. The site was chosen for its proximity to the River Thames for cooling water and coal delivery, and because it was in the heart of London, the station&#x27;s immediate supply area.

The proposal sparked protests from those who felt that the building would be too large and would be an eyesore, as well as worries about the pollution damaging local buildings, parks and even paintings in the nearby Tate Gallery. The company addressed the former concern by hiring Sir Giles Gilbert Scott to design the building&#x27;s exterior. He was a distinguished architect and industrial designer, famous for his designs for the red telephone box and Liverpool Anglican Cathedral. He subsequently designed another London power station, Bankside, which now houses Tate Modern art gallery. The pollution issue was resolved by granting permission for the station on the condition that its emissions were to be treated, to ensure they were &quot;clean and smokeless&quot;.

Construction of the first phase (the A Station) began in March 1929. The main building work was carried out by John Mowlem &amp; Co, and the structural steelwork erection carried out by Sir William Arrol &amp; Co. Other contractors were employed for specialist tasks. Most of the electrical equipment, including the steam turbine turbo generators, was produced by Metropolitan-Vickers in Trafford Park, Manchester. The building of the steel frame began in October 1930. Once completed, the construction of the brick cladding began, in March 1931. Until the construction of the B Station, the eastern wall of the boiler house was clad in corrugated metal sheeting as a temporary enclosure. The A Station first generated electricity in 1933, but was not completed until 1935. The total cost of its construction was £2,141,550. Between construction beginning in 1929 and 1933, there were six fatal and 201 non-fatal accidents on the site.

After the end of the Second World War, construction began on the second phase, the B Station. The station came into operation gradually between 1953 and 1955. It was nearly identical to the A Station from the outside and was constructed directly to its east as a mirror to it, which gave the power station its now familiar four-chimney layout. The construction of the B Station brought the site&#x27;s generating capacity up to 509MW, making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time, providing a fifth of London&#x27;s electricity needs (with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations). It was also the most thermally efficient power station in the world when it opened.

The A Station had been operated by the London Power Company, but by the time the B Station was completed, the UK&#x27;s electric supply industry had been nationalised, and ownership of the two stations had passed into the hands of the British Electricity Authority in 1948.

On 20 April 1964, a fire at the power station caused power failures throughout London, including at the BBC Television Centre, which was due to launch BBC2 that night; the launch was delayed until the following morning.

== Design and specification ==

Both of the stations were designed by a team of architects and engineers. The team was headed by Leonard Pearce, the chief engineer of the London Power Company, but a number of other notable engineers were also involved, including Henry Newmarch Allott, and T. P. O&#x27;Sullivan who was later responsible for the Assembly Hall at Filton. J. Theo Halliday was employed as architect, with Halliday &amp; Agate employed as a sub-consultant. Halliday was responsible for the supervision and execution of the appearance of the exterior and interior of the building. Architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott was involved in the project much later on, consulted to appease public reaction, and referred to in the press as &quot;architect of the exterior&quot;. The station was designed in the &quot;brick-cathedral&quot; style of power station design, which was popular at the time. Battersea is one of a very small number of examples of this style of power station design still in existence in the UK, others being Uskmouth and Bankside. The station&#x27;s design proved popular straightaway, and was described as a &quot;temple of power&quot;, which ranked equal with St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral as a London landmark. In a 1939 survey by &quot;The Architectural Review&quot;, a panel of celebrities ranked it as their second favourite modern building.

The A station&#x27;s control room was given many Art Deco fittings by architect Halliday. Italian marble was used in the turbine hall, and polished parquet floors and wrought-iron staircases were used throughout. Owing to a lack of available money following the Second World War, the interior of the B Station was not given the same treatment, and instead the fittings were made from stainless steel.

Each of the two connected stations consists of a long boiler house with a chimney at each end and an adjacent turbine hall. This makes a single main building which is of steel frame construction with brick cladding, similar to the skyscrapers built in the United States around the same time. The station is the largest brick structure in Europe. The building&#x27;s gross dimensions measure by , with the roof of the boiler house standing at over . Each of the four chimneys is made from concrete and stands tall with a base diameter of tapering to at the top. The station also had jetty facilities for unloading coal, a coal sorting and storage area, control rooms and an administration block.

The A Station generated electricity using three turbo alternators; two 69MW Metropolitan-Vickers British Thomson-Houston sets, and one 105 MW Metropolitan-Vickers set, totalling 243 MW. At the time of its commissioning, the 105 MW generating set was the largest in Europe. The B Station also had three turbo alternators, all made by Metropolitan-Vickers. This consisted of two units which used 16 MW high-pressure units exhausting to a 78 MW and associated with a 6 MW house alternator, giving these units a total rating of 100 MW. The third unit consisted of a 66 MW machine associated with a 6 MW house alternator, giving the unit a rating of 72 MW. Combined, these gave the B station a generating capacity of 260 MW, making the site&#x27;s generating capacity 503 MW. All of the station&#x27;s boilers were made by Babcock &amp; Wilcox, fuelled by pulverised coal from pulverisers also built by Babcock &amp; Wilcox. There were nine boilers in the A station and six in the B station. The B station&#x27;s boilers were the largest ever built in the UK at that time. The B station also had the highest thermal efficiency of any power station in the country for the first 12years of its operation.

== Operations ==
=== Coal transportation ===

The power station consumed over 1,000,000tonnes of coal annually, mostly from pits in South Wales and North East England, delivered by coastal colliers. These were &quot;flat-irons&quot; with a low-profile superstructure and fold-down funnels and masts to fit under the River Thames&#x27;s bridges above the Pool of London. The LPC and its nationalised successors owned and operated several &quot;flat-irons&quot; for this service.

Coal was usually delivered to the jetty where two cranes, capable of unloading two ships at a time at a rate of 480tonnes an hour, offloaded coal. Some coal was delivered by rail to the east of the station from the Brighton Main Line which passes nearby. A conveyor belt system moved the coal to a storage area or directly to the station&#x27;s boiler rooms. The conveyor belt system consisted of a series of bridges connected by towers. The storage area was a large concrete box capable of holding 75,000tonnes of coal. It had an overhead gantry and a conveyor belt attached to the conveyor belt system for moving coal to the boiler rooms.

=== Water system ===
Water, essential to a thermal power station, is used to condense steam from the steam turbines before it is returned to the boiler. Water cycled through the power station&#x27;s systems was taken from the Thames. The station could extract an average of 1.5million cubic metres (340million imperial gallons) of water from the river each day.

After the end of World War II, the London Power Company used the waste heat to supply the Pimlico District Heating Undertaking.

=== Scrubbers ===
The reduction of sulphur emissions was an important factor from when the station was in the design stages, as it was one of the main concerns of the protesters. The London Power Company developed an experimental technique for washing flue gases in 1925. It used water and alkaline sprays over scrubbers of steel and timber in flue ducts. The gases were subject to continuous washing; as to the principal acid pollutant by using the catalyst iron oxide, the sulphur dioxide was converted into sulphuric acid. The plant was one of the world&#x27;s first commercial applications of this technique. This process was stopped in the B Station in the 1960s, when it was discovered that the discharge of these products into the Thames was more harmful than sulphur dioxide would be to the atmosphere.

=== Electricity output ===
Electricity output from Battersea A &amp; B power stations over the period 1964–83 was as follows.

== Closure and redevelopment ==
=== Closure ===

The station&#x27;s demise was caused by its output falling with age, coupled with increased operating costs, such as flue gas cleaning. On 17 March 1975, the A Station was closed after being in operation for 40 years. By this time the A Station was co-firing oil and its generating capacity had declined to 228 MW.

Three years after the closure of the A Station, rumours began to circulate that the B Station would soon follow. A campaign was then launched to try to save the building as part of the national heritage. As a result, the station was declared a heritage site in 1980, when the Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, awarded the building Grade II listed status. (This was upgraded to Grade II* listed in 2007.) On 31 October 1983 production of electricity at Station B also ended, after nearly 30 years of operation. By then the B Station&#x27;s generating capacity had fallen to 146 MW. The closure of the two stations was put down largely to the generating equipment becoming outdated, and the preferred choice of fuel for electricity generation shifting from coal toward oil, gas and nuclear power.

=== Theme park proposal ===

Following the station&#x27;s closure, the Central Electricity Generating Board had planned to demolish the station and sell the land for housing, but because of the building&#x27;s then Grade II listed status, they had to pay the high cost of preserving the building. In 1983 they held a competition for ideas on the redevelopment of the site. It was won by a consortium led by developer David Roche and which included John Broome, owner of Alton Towers Ltd. This consortium proposed an indoor theme park, with shops and restaurants. At an estimated cost of £35 million, the scheme was risky and would require over 2 million visitors a year to make any profit. The scheme received planning approval in May 1986 and the site was purchased by John Broome for £1.5 million in 1987. Work on converting the site began the same year. British Rail planned to procure three electric multiple unit trains, designated &quot;Class 447&quot;, to run a shuttle service from London Victoria station to the theme park.

The project was halted in March 1989, for lack of funding, after costs had quickly escalated that January, from £35 million to £230 million. By this point huge sections of the building&#x27;s roof had been removed, so that machinery could be taken out. Without a roof, the building&#x27;s steel framework had been left exposed and its foundations were prone to flooding.

In March 1990, the proposal was changed to a mixture of offices, shops and a hotel. This proposal was granted planning permission in August 1990, despite opposition from 14 independent organisations, including English Heritage. Despite permission being granted, no further work took place on the site between 1990 and 1993.

=== Parkview proposal ===
In 1993, the site and its outstanding debt of £70 million were bought from the Bank of America by Hong Kong-based development company, Parkview International, for £10 million. Following resolution of creditors&#x27; claims, it acquired the freehold title in May 1996. In November 1996 plans for the redevelopment of the site were submitted and outline consent was received in May 1997. Detailed consent for much of the site was granted in August 2000, and the rest in May 2001. The company received full possession of the site in 2003. Having purchased the site, Parkview started work on a £1.1 billion project to restore the building and to redevelop the site into a retail, housing and leisure complex.

During the Parkview era several masterplans for the site were developed by various architects and subsequently discarded. One notable plan, called simply &quot;The Power Station&quot;, was masterminded by architect Nicholas Grimshaw. The scheme proposed a shopping mall, with 40 to 50 restaurants, cafés and bars, 180 shops, as well as nightclubs, comedy venues and a cinema. Cosmopolitan shops would have been sited in the A Station&#x27;s turbine hall, and label name shops in the B Station&#x27;s turbine hall. The boiler house would have been glazed over and used as a public space for installations and exhibitions. A riverside walkway would also be created, running continuously along the riverside from Vauxhall to Battersea Park.

Parkview claimed that 3,000 jobs would be created during the construction of the project, and 9,000 would be employed once completed, with an emphasis on local recruitment. The Battersea Power Station Community Group campaigned against the Parkview plan and argued for an alternative community-based scheme to be drawn up. The group described the plans as &quot;a deeply unattractive project that has no affordable housing anywhere on the site, no decent jobs for local people and no credible public transport strategy&quot;. They also criticised the appropriateness of the project for its location, and the proposal of other large buildings on the site. Keith Garner of the group said &quot;I feel that there&#x27;s a real problem of appropriateness. They need a completely different kind of scheme, not this airport-lounge treatment. What you see now is a majestic building looming up from the river. If you surround it with buildings 15 storeys high, you don&#x27;t have a landmark any more.&quot;

In 2005 Parkview, English Heritage and the London Borough of Wandsworth said that the reinforcement inside the chimneys was corroded and irreparable. Wandsworth Council granted permission for them to be demolished and rebuilt. However, the Twentieth Century Society, the World Monuments Fund and the Battersea Power Station Company commissioned an alternative engineers&#x27; report that concluded that the existing chimneys could be repaired. In response, Parkview said that they had provided a legally binding undertaking to the council to provide certainty that the chimneys would be replaced &quot;like for like&quot;, in accordance with the requirements of English Heritage and the planning authorities.

=== REO proposal ===

In November 2006, it was announced that Real Estate Opportunities, led by Irish businessmen Richard Barrett and Johnny Ronan of Treasury Holdings, had purchased Battersea Power Station and the surrounding land for €532million (£400million). REO subsequently announced that the previous plan by Parkview had been dropped and that it had appointed the practice of the Uruguayan-born architect Rafael Viñoly of New York as the new master planner for the site. The centrepiece of this masterplan was a 980-foot-high &quot;eco tower&quot; that dwarfed the power station and was described by London&#x27;s then mayor Boris Johnson as an &quot;inverted toilet-roll holder&quot;. The tower was quickly dropped from the scheme. Jersey law firms, Ogier, Carey Olsen and Mourant Oxannes helped REO to raise funds for the new Battersea Power Station redevelopment.

The plans included reusing part of the station building as a power station, fuelled by biomass and waste. The station&#x27;s existing chimneys would be utilised for venting steam. The former turbine halls would be converted to shopping spaces, and the roofless boiler house used as a park. An energy museum would also be housed inside the former station building. The restoration of the power station building would cost £150million.

A plastic built &quot;eco-dome&quot; was to be built to the east of the power station. This building was originally planned to have a large chimney, but this has now been abandoned in favour of a series of smaller towers. The eco-dome would house offices, and aim to reduce energy consumption in the buildings by 67% compared to conventional office buildings, by using the towers to draw cool air through the building. 3,200 new homes would also be built on the site to house 7,000 people.

In June 2008 a consultation process was launched, which revealed that 66% of the general public were in favour of the plans. At an event at the station on 23 March 2009, it was announced that REO were to submit the planning application for their proposal to Wandsworth Council.

The Council gave planning consent on 11 November 2010. REO hoped construction would begin in 2011, but this was cancelled. The station structure itself was expected to be repaired and secure by 2016, with completion of the whole project by 2020. Plans included the construction of 3,400 apartments and of office space. Approximately 28,000 inhabitants and 25,000 workers would be expected to occupy the space once complete.

Reuters reported in September 2011 that lenders would allow more time for a new equity partner to be found:

Lenders to the owner of Battersea Power Station in London waived a debt maturity deadline yesterday while talks with potential new equity partners for its redevelopment continued, a source close to the process told Reuters. AIM-listed Real Estate Opportunities is seeking a partner for the 5.5 billion pound ($9 billion) development, and its senior lenders Lloyds and Ireland&#x27;s National Asset Management Agency have already extended a deadline once relating to the £400million REO paid for the site in 2006. &#x27;The banks have nothing to gain by calling the debt in. Talks with new equity partners continue, and an announcement may come in the next few weeks,&#x27; the source said.
However, in November 2011, Lloyds and NAMA called in the debt and the REO scheme collapsed into administration.

=== Alternative proposals ===
==== Farrell and Partners urban park proposal ====

In February 2012, Sir Terry Farrell&#x27;s architectural firm put forward a proposal to convert the power station site into an &quot;urban park&quot; with an option to develop housing at a later date. In this vision, Farrell proposed to demolish all but the central boiler hall and chimneys and display the switching equipment from the control rooms in &#x27;pods&#x27;. However, this plan was always unlikely to bear fruit due to the Grade II listing status of the building.

==== Chelsea F.C. interest ====
In November 2008, Chelsea F.C. was reported to be considering moving to a new purpose built stadium at Battersea Power Station. The proposed stadium was to hold between 65,000 and 75,000 fans and feature a retractable roof. The proposals were designed by HOK Sport, the same company who designed Wembley Stadium. However, the scheme was seriously in doubt due to concerns for the preservation of the site and the collapse of the REO scheme in late November 2011.

On 4 May 2012, Chelsea announced a bid to purchase the site to build a 60,000-seater stadium in conjunction with property developers Almacantar. However the bid was not accepted.

=== 2012 redevelopment plans ===
Following the failure of the REO bid to develop the site, in February 2012, the power station was put up for sale on the open market for the first time in its history. The sale was conducted by the commercial estate agent, Knight Frank, on behalf of the site&#x27;s creditors. In May 2012, several bids were received for the landmark site, which was put on the market after Nama and Lloyds Banking Group called in loans held by Treasury Holdings&#x27; Real Estate Opportunities (REO). Bids were received from Chelsea F.C. with other interested parties including a Malaysian interest, SP Setia, London &amp; Regional, a company owned by the London-based Livingstone brothers, and housebuilder Berkeley. The net price was £400million which would discharge the £325million to cover the debts held by Nama and Lloyds &quot;plus&quot; a £100million contribution to the Northern line extension. If the sale was unsuccessful, the administrator or its agent(s) would have kept the landowner&#x27;s duty to maintain and preserve the site per its listed status.

==== Agreement with Malaysian developers ====
In June 2012, Knight Frank announced that administrators Ernst &amp; Young had entered into an exclusive agreement with Malaysian developers S P Setia (a property company), Sime Darby (a trading conglomerate) and Employees Provident Fund (Malaysia&#x27;s largest pension fund). Following due diligence and agreement of the final terms of the deal, the sale to the Malaysian consortium was completed in September 2012.

The redevelopment of the site used the existing Vinoly master plan, which intended to position the power station as the central focus of the regenerated site, housing a blend of shops, cafes, restaurants, art and leisure facilities, office space and residential accommodation. The plan included the restoration of the historic power station itself, the creation of a new riverside park to the north of the power station and the creation of a new High Street designed to link the entrance to Battersea Power Station tube station with the power station. The redevelopment hoped to bring about the extension of the existing riverside walk and facilitate access directly from the power station to Battersea Park and Chelsea Bridge. The full redevelopment consisted of eight main phases, some of which were planned to run concurrently. The plan included over 800 homes of varying sizes.

Construction work on Phase 1, called Circus West Village, designed by architects SimpsonHaugh and dRMM, was undertaken by Carillion and commenced in 2013 alongside work on the power station. Phase 1 was completed in 2017, with the Northern line extension and its new Battersea Power Station terminus completed in 2021. Circus West Village has over 1500 residents and over 23 restaurants, cafes and retailers.

WilkinsonEyre was appointed in 2013 to carry out the restoration of the Grade II* listed Power Station. Work commenced in 2013 and plans included the restoration of the art deco structure internally and externally, reconstruction of the chimneys, and refurbishment of the historic cranes and jetty as a new river taxi stop. Restoration work on the power station&#x27;s chimneys was completed in 2017. In 2019, the jetty in front of the power station opened to the public for the first time in its history. Retail brands inside the power station include BOSS, Jo Malone London, Uniqlo, Mac Cosmetics, Space NK, Watches of Switzerland and many more. In May 2021, the first residents moved into their new homes at the power station. As part of the development, a 200-seat theatre, the Turbine Theatre, was established in railway arches under the Grosvenor Bridge in September 2019.

In October 2013, Frank Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design &quot;Phase 3&quot; of the scheme, which will provide &quot;the gateway to the entire development and the new Northern line extension&quot;.

===London Underground extension===
The London Underground&#x27;s Northern line was extended to serve Nine Elms and the power station, branching off at Kennington station. Two stations, Nine Elms station and Battersea Power Station station, opened on 20 September 2021. The construction cost £1.1billion and is long. The developers provided £270m towards the construction of the extension.

=== Apple ===
In September 2016, Apple announced plans to consolidate 1,400 London employees, from seven locations, at the station by 2021, occupying around of the power station building as its new London headquarters. The move was later delayed to 2022 by the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple and other firms will share the site with over 4,000 homes, of which 295 are in the power station.

===2022 opening===

Works were completed and nearly forty years after the lights were switched off, Battersea Power Station opened its doors to the public on Friday 14 October 2022, marking the first time the public were able to explore the iconic building and the first tranche of shops, bars, restaurants and leisure venues.

Electric Boulevard, a new pedestrianised high street, that runs between Gehry Partners&#x27; Prospect Place and Foster + Partners&#x27; Battersea Roof Gardens to the riverside neighbourhood&#x27;s Zone 1 London Underground Station, opened the same day.

As well as 254 apartments inside the power station itself, the 42-acre site also contains apartment buildings designed by US architect Frank Gehry and by Foster + Partners. The first residents had moved in to the power station in May 2021. The roof-gardens have been designed by Andy Sturgeon and his team. It won the Garden of the Year Award 2024 of the Society of Garden Designers.

== Event venue ==
The power station has been used for various sporting, cultural and political events. Since 22 August 2009, the station has been used as a venue on the Red Bull X-Fighters season. On 13 April 2010 the station was used as the venue for the launch of the Conservative Party&#x27;s 2010 general election manifesto. Between 6 and 7 May 2010, the station site was used by Sky News in their coverage of the election. Most recently, the power station has been used for a light show.

== In popular culture ==
Battersea Power Station has become an iconic structure, featured in or used as a shooting location for many films, television programmes, music videos, and video games. One of the station&#x27;s earliest film appearances was in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1936 film &quot;Sabotage&quot;; this was before the construction of the B station.

The station gained exposure in the cover photograph of Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1977 album, &quot;Animals&quot;, which sold millions of copies worldwide. The photo, taken in early December 1976, shows the power station with an inflatable pink pig floating above it. It was tethered to one of the power station&#x27;s southern chimneys, but broke loose from its moorings and drifted into the flight path of Heathrow Airport. The album itself was officially launched at an event at the power station.

The control room of Station A is used as the backdrop for a scene in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s The Meaning of Life&quot; (1983). The station appears in the 1997 music video for The Pillows song, &quot;Hybrid Rainbow&quot;. In the 2006 movie &quot;Children of Men,&quot; it serves as the fictional &quot;Ark of Arts&quot;. A pig balloon also appears in the scene as homage to Pink Floyd. Scenes from the 2008 Batman film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; were filmed at Battersea. Battersea was featured as a redeveloped shopping centre in the 2020 video game &quot;Watch Dogs: Legion&quot;.

<text>Hugh the Great (16 June 956) was the duke of the Franks and count of Paris. He was the most powerful magnate in France. Son of King Robert I of France, Hugh was Margrave of Neustria. He played an active role in bringing King Louis IV of France back from England in 936. Seeking an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor Otto the Great, he married Otto&#x27;s younger sister Hedwig of Saxony in 937. They were the parents of Hugh Capet. Hedwig&#x27;s sister, Gerberga of Saxony, was Louis&#x27; wife. Although he often fought with Louis, he supported the accession of Louis and Gerberga&#x27;s son, Lothair of France.

==Biography==
Hugh was the son of King Robert I of France and Béatrice of Vermandois, a descendant of Charlemagne. He was born in Paris, Île-de-France, France. His eldest son was Hugh Capet who became King of France in 987. His family is known as the Robertians.

In 922, the barons of Western Francia, after revolting against the Carolingian King Charles the Simple (who fled his kingdom under their onslaught), elected Robert I, Hugh&#x27;s father, as king of Western Francia. At the death of Robert I, in battle at Soissons in 923, Hugh refused the crown and it went to his brother-in-law Rudolph. Charles sought help in regaining his crown from Hugh&#x27;s cousin Count Herbert II of Vermandois, who instead of helping the king imprisoned him. Herbert then used his prisoner as an advantage in pressing his own ambitions, using the threat of releasing the king up until Charles&#x27; death in 929. From then on Herbert II of Vermandois struggled with King Rudolph and Duke Hugh. Finally Rudolph and Herbert II came to an agreement in 935.

At the death of Rudolph in 936, Hugh was in possession of nearly all of the region between the Loire and the Seine, corresponding to the ancient Neustria, with the exceptions of Anjou and of the territory ceded to the Normans in 911. He took a very active part in bringing King Louis IV (&quot;d&#x27;Outremer&quot;) from the Kingdom of England in 936. Historians have wondered why the powerful Hugh the Great called the young Louis to throne instead of taking it himself, as his father had done fifteen years earlier. In the first place, he had many rivals, especially Hugh, Duke of Burgundy (King Rudolph&#x27;s brother), and Herbert II, Count of Vermandois, who probably would have challenged his election. But above all, it seems that he was shocked by the early death of his father. Richerus explains that Hugh the Great remembered his father who had died for his &quot;pretentions&quot; and this was the cause of his short and turbulent reign. 

In 937, Hugh&#x27;s second wife, Eadhild, died. Later that year, he married Hedwige of Saxony, a daughter of King Henry the Fowler of Germany and Matilda. Soon after this, his third marriage, he was drawn into a prolonged quarrel with Louis IV. In 938, King Louis IV began attacking fortresses and lands formerly held by members of his family, some held by Herbert II of Vermandois. In 939, King Louis attacked Hugh the Great and Duke William Longsword of Normandy, after which a truce was concluded, lasting until June. That same year, Hugh, along with Count Herbert II of Vermandois, Count Arnulf I of Flanders and Duke William Longsword paid homage to the Emperor Otto the Great, and supported him in his struggle against Louis.

When Louis fell into the hands of the Normans in 945, he was handed over to Hugh in exchange for their young duke Richard. Hugh released Louis IV in 946 on condition that he should surrender the fortress of Laon. In 948 at a church council at Ingelheim the bishops, all but two being from Germany, condemned and excommunicated Hugh &quot;in absentia&quot;, and returned Archbishop Artauld to his See at Reims. Hugh&#x27;s response was to attack Soissons and Reims while the excommunication was repeated by a council at Trier. In 953 Hugh finally relented and made peace with Louis IV, the church and his brother-in-law Otto the Great.

On the death of Louis IV, Hugh was one of the first to recognize Lothair as his successor, and, at the intervention of Lothair&#x27;s mother, Gerberga of Saxony, was instrumental in having him crowned. In recognition of this service Hugh was invested by the new king with the duchies of Burgundy and Aquitaine. In the same year, however, Duke Gilbert of Burgundy acknowledged himself his vassal and betrothed his daughter to Hugh&#x27;s son Otto-Henry. At Giselbert&#x27;s death on 8 April 956, Hugh became effective master of the duchy; Hugh died in Dourdan on 16 June.

==Family==
Hugh married first, in 922, Judith, daughter of Roger, Count of Maine, and his wife Rothilde, a daughter of Emperor Charles the Bald. She died childless in 925. Hugh&#x27;s second wife was Eadhild, daughter of Edward the Elder, king of the Anglo-Saxons, and half-sister of King Æthelstan. They married in 926 and she died in 937, childless. Hugh&#x27;s married his third wife, Hedwig of Saxony, daughter of Henry the Fowler and Matilda, in 937. She and Hugh had:

* Beatrice married Frederick I, Duke of Upper Lorraine.
* Hugh Capet (c. 941–996)
* Emma (c. 943after 968).
* Otto, Duke of Burgundy, a minor in 956.
* Odo-Henry (Henry I, Duke of Burgundy) (946–1002)

<doc id="125751" wikidata="Q2473545" url="?curid=125751" title="Mitford family">
<text>The Mitford family is an aristocratic English family who became particularly well-known in the 1930s for the six Mitford sisters, the daughters of David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale and his wife, Sydney Bowles. They were celebrated and sometimes scandalous figures. One journalist described them as &quot;Diana the Fascist, Jessica the Communist, Unity the Hitler-lover; Nancy the Novelist; Deborah the Duchess and Pamela the unobtrusive poultry connoisseur&quot;. 

==Background==

The family traces its origins in Northumberland back to the time of the Norman Conquest. In the Middle Ages they had been Border Reivers based in Redesdale. The main line had its family seat first at Mitford Castle, then Mitford Old Manor House, prior to building Mitford Hall in 1828. All three are near Mitford, Northumberland. Several heads of the family served as High Sheriff of Northumberland. 

A junior line, with seats at Newton Park, Northumberland, and Exbury House, Hampshire, descends via the historian William Mitford (1744–1827) and were twice elevated to the British peerage, in 1802 and 1902, under the title Baron Redesdale. This branch of the family, to whom the Mitford sisters belonged, were seated at Batsford Park, Gloucestershire and then at Asthall Manor and Swinbrook, in Oxfordshire.

==Mitford siblings==
*Nancy Mitford (28 November 1904 – 30 June 1973) married Peter Rodd, whom she subsequently divorced, and had a longstanding relationship with French politician and statesman Gaston Palewski. She lived in France for much of her adult life. She wrote many novels, including the semi-autobiographical &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; and &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;. She was also a biographer of historical figures, including the Sun King.
*Pamela &quot;Pam&quot; Mitford (25 November 1907 – 12 April 1994) was called &quot;Woman&quot; by her siblings. John Betjeman, who for a time was in love with her, referred to her as the &quot;Rural Mitford&quot;. She married and later divorced millionaire physicist Derek Jackson, and spent much of the 1960s living with Giuditta Tommasi (died 1993), an Italian horsewoman.
*Thomas David &quot;Tom&quot; Mitford (2 January 1909 – 30 March 1945), the only son, was educated at Eton, where he had an affair with James Lees-Milne. He later had a lengthy affair with Austrian Jewish dancer Tilly Losch during her marriage to Edward James. According to Jessica&#x27;s letters, Thomas supported British fascism and was posted to the Burma campaign after he had refused to fight in Europe. He died in action.
*Diana Mitford (17 June 1910 – 11 August 2003) married aristocrat and writer Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne in 1929. She left him in 1933 for British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, Bt., who she married in 1936 and with whom she had two sons, Alexander and Max Mosley. The couple were interned in Holloway Prison from May 1940 until November 1943.
*Unity Valkyrie Mitford (8 August 1914 – 28 May 1948) was known as &quot;Bobo&quot; or &quot;Boud&quot; to her siblings. Her adulation of, and friendship with, Adolf Hitler was widely publicised. She shot herself in the head just hours after Britain declared war on Germany, surviving, but with permanent brain damage. In 1944 her family sent her to the Scottish islet of Inch Kenneth, where she lived out the war. She died of pneumococcal meningitis at West Highland Cottage Hospital, Oban.
*Jessica Lucy &quot;Decca&quot; Mitford (11 September 1917 – 23 July 1996), unlike the rest of her family, was a communist. She eloped with Esmond Romilly to Spain to participate in the Civil War; they subsequently moved to the United States. On 30 November 1941, during an air raid on Hamburg, Romilly&#x27;s aircraft was lost over the North Sea with all on board. She remained in the U.S. most of her adult life, where she married Robert Treuhaft and was a member of the American Communist Party until 1958. She wrote several volumes of memoirs and several volumes of polemical investigation, including the best-selling &quot;The American Way of Death&quot; (1963) about the funeral industry. She was the grandmother of James Forman Jr. and Chaka Forman, sons of the African-American civil rights leader James Forman by her daughter Constancia Romilly.
*Deborah Vivien &quot;Debo&quot; Mitford (31 March 1920 – 24 September 2014) was nicknamed &quot;Nine&quot; by her sister Nancy (Debo&#x27;s supposed mental age.) She married Andrew Cavendish (1920—2004), who later became the Duke of Devonshire, and with him turned his ancestral home Chatsworth House into one of Britain&#x27;s most successful stately homes. She wrote several books.

==Mitford sisters==
The sisters gained widespread attention for their stylish and controversial lives as young people, and for their public political divisions between communism and fascism. Nancy and Jessica became well-known writers: Nancy wrote &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; and &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;, and Jessica &quot;The American Way of Death&quot; (1963). Deborah managed Chatsworth House, one of the most successful stately homes in England.

Jessica and Deborah married nephews of prime ministers Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan, respectively. Deborah and Diana both married wealthy aristocrats. Unity and Diana were well known during the 1930s for being close to Adolf Hitler. Jessica turned her back on her inherited privileges and eloped with her cousin, Esmond Romilly, who was hoping to report on the Spanish Civil War for the &quot;News Chronicle&quot;, having briefly fought with the International Brigade. Jessica&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Hons and Rebels&quot;, describes their upbringing. Nancy drew upon her family members for characters in her novels. In 1981, Deborah became politically active when she and her husband Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire, joined the new Social Democratic Party.

The sisters and their brother Thomas were the children of David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale, and his wife Sydney, the daughter of Thomas Bowles. To their children, they were known as &quot;Farve&quot; and &quot;Muv&quot;, respectively. David and Sydney married in 1904. The family homes changed from Batsford House to Asthall Manor beside the River Windrush in Oxfordshire, and then Swinbrook Cottage nearby, with a house at Rutland Gate in London. They also lived in a cottage in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, which they used as a summer residence. 

The siblings grew up in an aristocratic country house with emotionally distant parents and a large household with numerous servants. This family dynamic was not unusual for upper-class families of the time. The parents disregarded formal education of women of the family, and they were expected to marry at a young age to a financially well-off husband. The children had a private language called &quot;Boudledidge&quot; (), and each had a different nickname for the others.

After the Nazi Regime started the Invasion of Poland, the Second World War began and their political views came into sharper relief. &quot;Farve&quot; remained a conservative who had long favoured the Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s approach of appeasing Nazi Germany. Once Britain declared war on Germany, he returned to being an anti-German British patriot. &quot;Muv&quot; continued her fascist sympathies and usually supported her fascist children. The couple separated in 1943 as a result of this conflict.

Nancy, a moderate socialist, worked in London during the Blitz and informed on her fascist siblings to the British authorities. Pamela remained seemingly non-political, although according to her sister Nancy, Pamela and Derek Jackson were virulent anti-Semites verbally during World War II, who had called for all Jews in England to be killed, and wanted an early end to the war with Nazi Germany before England lost any more money.

Tom, a fascist, refused to fight Germany but volunteered to fight against Imperial Japan. He was killed in action in Burma in 1945. Diana, also a fascist, married to Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, was imprisoned in London from May 1940 until November 1943 under Defence Regulation 18B. Unity, fanatically devoted to Hitler and Nazism, was distraught over Britain&#x27;s war declaration against Germany on 3 September 1939, and tried to commit suicide later that day by shooting herself in the head. She failed in the suicide attempt, but suffered brain damage that eventually led to her early death in 1948.

Jessica, a communist, had moved to the US, but her husband Esmond Romilly, a Republican veteran from the Spanish Civil War who volunteered for the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II, died in 1941 when his bomber developed mechanical problems over the North Sea and went down. In numerous letters Jessica said that her daughter Constancia received a pension from the Canadian government after Esmond&#x27;s death until she turned 18. 

The strong political rift between Jessica and Diana left them estranged from 1936 until their deaths, although they did speak to each other in 1973, as their eldest sister Nancy was on her deathbed. Aside from Jessica and Diana&#x27;s estrangement, the sisters kept in frequent contact with each other in the decades after World War II. The sisters were prolific letter-writers, and a substantial body of correspondence still exists, principally letters between them.

*Nancy Mitford&#x27;s 1949 novel, &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;, which was based on the family, was serialised by Thames Television in 1980 and by the BBC in 2001. Her novel &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot; was serialised by the BBC in 2021.
*The daughters were the subject of a 1981 musical, &quot;The Mitford Girls,&quot; by Caryl Brahms and Ned Sherrin, and of a song, &quot;The Mitford Sisters&quot;, by Luke Haines.
*A fictional family based on the Mitford sisters features prominently in Jo Walton&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;Ha&#x27;penny&quot;; Viola Lark, one of the point-of-view characters, is one of the sisters, another is married to Himmler, and a third is a Communist spy.
*The fictional &quot;Combe sisters&quot; in the BBC 2 series &quot;Bellamy&#x27;s People&quot;, first broadcast in 2010, bear a striking resemblance to the Mitford sisters. Bellamy meets two of the surviving Combe sisters, said to have been notorious in the 1930s and &#x27;40s for their extreme political views, now living together in a strained relationship in the dramatically different political realities of 2010. One an avid fascist and the other a committed Communist, the sisters have hit upon the solution of dividing their stately home down the middle, each converting her side into a homage to her ideology.
*Sharon Horgan, Samantha Spiro, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor played a version of the Mitford Sisters in a song-based sketch for Season 2 of the Sky Arts comedy series &quot;Psychobitches&quot;, in the winter of 2014.
*In his French language trilogy of novels – &quot;Le Vent du soir&quot; (1985), &quot;Tous les hommes en sont fous&quot; (1985), and &quot;Le Bonheur à San Miniato&quot; (1987) – Jean d&#x27;Ormesson recounts a much-imagined version of the exploits of four of the Mitford sisters, through the characters Pandora, Vanessa, Atalanta, and Jessica.
*A portion of Jessica Mitford&#x27;s writing is used as a spoken-word introduction to the song &quot;Last Act of Defiance&quot;, about the New Mexico State Penitentiary riot, on thrash metal band Exodus&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot;.
*Jessica Fellowes has written six mystery novels, &quot;The Mitford Murders&quot; (2017), &quot;Bright Young Dead&quot; (2018), &quot;The Mitford Scandal&quot; (2020),&quot;The Mitford Trial&quot; (2021), &quot;The Mitford Vanishing&quot; (2022), and &quot;The Mitford Secret&quot; (2023), which feature the three oldest sisters, Nancy, Pamela, and Diana as major characters, and the rest of the family in supporting roles.
* Diana Mitford is depicted in Season 6 of the BBC/Netflix TV series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; (2022), played by British actress Amber Anderson. The show is set in the 1930s and depicts Diana, and husband Oswald Mosley, getting involved with fictional protagonist Tommy Shelby to advance their political goals.
* In the Discworld novel &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; by Terry Pratchett, werewolf Watchwoman Angua von Überwald refers to two relatives of hers as Nancy and Unity. Angua&#x27;s brother Wolfgang is a werewolf supremacist whose personal insignia reflect those of Nazism.
* In the fourth series of BBC comedy television series &quot;The Thick Of It&quot;, British Government minister Peter Mannion describes his special adviser Emma Messinger as having &quot;turned into the wrong Mitford sister&quot; during a presentation where she remarks on the physical attractiveness of a likely candidate for Leader of the Opposition.
*&quot;Outrageous&quot; is an upcoming British television series about the Mitford sisters.

<text>Hardyston Township is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 8,125, a decrease of 88 (−1.1%) from the 2010 census count of 8,213, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,042 (+33.1%) from the 6,171 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Hardyston Township was set off from portions of Newton Township by Royal charter on February 25, 1762. It was named after Josiah Hardy, who was royal governor of New Jersey from 1761 to 1763. The original British spelling of &quot;Hardiston&quot; was Americanized to &quot;Hardyston&quot; after the American Revolutionary War.

Hardyston was incorporated on February 21, 1798, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature as one of New Jersey&#x27;s original group of 104 townships. Over the centuries, portions of the township were taken to form Vernon Township (April 8, 1793), Sparta (April 14, 1845), Franklin (March 18, 1913) and Hamburg (March 19, 1920).

Hardyston was serviced first by the New Jersey Midland Railway, which built the station in Stockholm. However, there was a dispute over the name as that area was known as Snufftown because of the snuff factory along the Pequannock River, which provide the water power. Through a series of events between the residents of Stockholm and the railroad, the area eventually changed the name from Snufftown to Stockholm. Later, it was the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway, who provided service into the early 1960s when a mud slide removed a large section of trackage in West Milford Township and coupled with low productivity, the line was not repaired and service was disconnected. Today, the New York Susquehanna and Western Railway runs freight through Hardyston. The main highways are Route 23 and Route 94.

A large eastern portion of the township is owned by the City of Newark, Essex County, for their Pequannock River Watershed, which provides water to the city from an area of that also includes portions of Jefferson Township, Kinnelon, Rockaway Township, Vernon Township and West Milford.

* Daniel Haines (1801–1877) 14th Governor of New Jersey, from 1843 to 1845, and from 1848 to 1851.

<text>Hopatcong ( ) is a borough in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 14,362, a decrease of 785 (−5.2%) from the 2010 census count of 15,147, which in turn reflected a decline of 741 (−4.7%) from the 15,888 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
The town of Hopatcong has a rich history, given its relationship with New York City. It borders Lake Hopatcong, a partially man-made lake that is now a source of much recreation and desirable real estate, and is the biggest lake in New Jersey. The community, west of New York City, began as a summer getaway for the wealthy in NYC who primarily sought access to the lake. An amusement park, called &quot;Bertrand&#x27;s Island&quot;, sprang up and was accessible via the lake, trolley or by car through Mount Arlington. The construction of Interstate 80, a highway that stretches from Teaneck, New Jersey, all the way across the country to San Francisco, California, triggered rapid growth in New York City&#x27;s suburbs and led to Hopatcong becoming a permanent residential community.
The area had been called &quot;Brookland&quot; in the 19th century and the lake that was expanded to become Lake Hopatcong had been known as &quot;Great Pond&quot; or &quot;Brookland Pond&quot;. During the 1830s, the name of the community had been modified to &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, to match the spelling of the city on New York&#x27;s Long Island. Hopatcong was originally established as the Town of Brooklyn on April 2, 1898, from portions of Byram Township. On March 22, 1901, the Borough of Hopatcong replaced Brooklyn. In 1922, residents of Byram Cove, Northwood, and other areas to the west of the original land area of the borough, voted to leave Byram Township and join Hopatcong, leaving the Borough with its current borders.

While the origin of the borough&#x27;s name is unclear, it is said to derive from Native American phrases variously meaning &quot;stone over water&quot; or &quot;pipestone&quot;, among other variations.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 12.35 square miles (31.99 km2), including 10.89 square miles (28.21 km2) of land and 1.46 square miles (3.78 km2) of water (11.83%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Bear Pond, Byram Cove, Cow Tongue Point, Davis Cove, Glasser, Hendersons Cove, Roseville, Sharps Rock and Sperry Springs.

Hopatcong borders Byram Township, Sparta Township and Stanhope in Sussex County; and Jefferson Township, Mount Arlington and Roxbury Township in Morris County.

<doc id="125758" wikidata="Q1084758" url="?curid=125758" title="Lake Mohawk, New Jersey">
<text>Lake Mohawk is an unincorporated residential development and census-designated place (CDP) split between Byram Township and Sparta Township, in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2010 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 9,916, of which 1,824 were in Byram Township and 8,092 in Sparta Township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of 6.172 square miles (15.987 km2), including 5.005 square miles (12.964 km2) of land and 1.167 square miles (3.023 km2) of water (18.91%).

The community is located largely within the township of Sparta, with a portion located in Byram Township.

== History ==
In 1924 tributary streams and natural springs of the Wallkill River were impounded at the northern end of Brogden Meadow in Sussex County. The Arthur D. Crane Company, a real estate development venture in partnership with Herbert Closs, acquired of farmland. In 1926, Brogden Meadow was cleared and work started on a dam that would create Lake Mohawk. The dam was completed August 1926. It took until 1928 for water to fill the lake which now drains into the Wallkill River.

==Community==

The community is located around Lake Mohawk, the largest artificial body of water in the state of New Jersey that is a private lake. There is the main lake in the mountains of the community and the Alpine Pool, both of which are spring fed. The water for the Alpine Pool cascades down gracefully from a spring that rises from an even higher peak in the mountains. An alpine motif was used throughout the community.

The buildings in the tiny town center resemble little castles, or reflect an alpine architectural style. This distinctive architecture in the town center and of many homes was a major aspect of the listing of Lake Mohawk on the National Register of Historic Places. The town center has restaurants, a post office, and limited shop, service, or professional space. This area is called White Deer Plaza after a Native American who lent her name to the center. A tiered boardwalk was constructed along the northern edge of the lake where the town center exists. A country club dominates the boardwalk near the dam.

In the 1950s a movie theater, a stone&#x27;s throw beyond the main entrance to the lake, called Winona Parkway, was built along the adjacent county roadway, route 15, which leads to the Dutch colonial and revolutionary era mining town of Sparta.

Except for the Alpine Pool and the main lake areas that are accessible from an entrance high in the mountains, all of the community is reached by descending from the surrounding mountains of Sussex County. Homes have been built up each face of the enclosing mountains, but the roads to them are accessed only from the main road around the lake. From the Alpine Pool, a panoramic view of the county is possible. On one side almost the entire stretch of the main lake is visible and on the other, the mountains that reach into the states of Pennsylvania and New York.

At the southern end of the lake is a swimming pool and tennis complex originally called the &quot;Marine Pool&quot;, that is constructed to resemble the deck of an ocean liner. It is modeled after the likes of SS &quot;Normandie&quot;, having all of the appointments of a cruise ship, with a galley motif for the restaurant and a great stand of stadium seating with colorful backs for the spectators at swimming events held at the facility. Through the seating is a stairway to the captain&#x27;s quarters where the managers and lifeguards have quarters and stow special equipment.

The pool is ozone filtered, without a drop of chlorine in the water, and was the first pool in the United States to use corona discharge (CD) ozone to treat its water. The filter system, built in 1937, was designed to resemble the engine room of the ship. The pool is Olympic-size (50 m, with eight lanes) and has a central tower for diving events. The depth of the pool at that portion is ten feet. Both ends of the pool are more shallow, with a kiddie section nearest the tennis courts. On the northern end of the pool near the galley, there used to be a giant water slide that had been featured in television commercials for Zest soap in the 1960s. Beyond the pool to the south are three asphalt tennis courts, with another set of three clay courts in the parking area.

Swimming events at the pool are AAU competitions in all aquatic categories. Celebrities such as Buster Crabbe and Esther Williams were normal fare at the events in the 1940s and 1950s. This was a time when the youngsters of the community could hitch-hike rides along the road from their neighbors without concern.

In the 1940s and 1950s there was an &quot;Indian village&quot; with a souvenir shop, located along the opposite shore of the southern end of the lake that added another attraction depicted in postcards of the day. The development of Lake Mohawk was referred to as a &quot;reservation&quot; in most promotional materials to continue the Indian tribe imagery.

Many of the homes along the water have boathouses and docks. Sail boats and motor boats are a popular way to get around the lake. The &quot;Marine Base&quot;, a marina built in the style of the country club, is located at a midpoint along the lake on the eastern shore.

The community used to be composed of summer residences. Few lived there around the year. Many houses were not insulated, nor did they have heating beyond a fireplace for especially cool summer nights. Among those who stayed year round, friends would be hosted for the snowy holidays and winter sports. Driving across the frozen lake was shorter and safer than trying to traverse the steep hills. Even delivery trucks would make the short trip across the ice.

The seasonal residents of the early years included many who showed horses in the English-style regional circuits. Hunters, open-jumpers, and three- and five-gated saddle horses competed in the events. The Lake Mohawk Horse Show drew competitors from New York and Pennsylvania as well as New Jersey. The professional photographer who traveled from show to show along with the competitors throughout the season, maintained his office in Lake Mohawk at a little castle structure opposite the club house. Photographs of the competitors, judges, and winners were available from his files, selected from proofs sent to the subjects or from displays he set up at later shows.

The route to Lake Mohawk was a winding drive up and down through a shady rural and mountainous roadside until after the completion of Interstate Highways connecting the area to the New York metropolitan area. After those high speed connections were established nearby into the county, the community took on a year-round population of entertainers, airline employees and pilots, as well as commuters.

=== Lake Mohawk Golf Club ===
The Arthur D Crane company set aside 125 acres in the 1920s for a golf course within the Lake Mohawk Community. The first nine holes opened on August 30, 1929.  Architect Irving Sewall designed the course.  In the 1930s the course converted into private membership and remains separate from the larger reservation. Today the golf course offers a Par 70 18 hole course and has a full-length driving range, practice green, and clubhouse.

===Lake Mohawk Yacht Club===

Incorporated in 1938, the club is a private yacht club located in Sparta Township, New Jersey, on Lake Mohawk. Sailing was taking place as an organized activity on the lake as early as 1933. Lake Mohawk Country Club members Charles Gabor and Morgan Reichner decided to adopt the Snipe as the most suitable boat for the lake, and the Snipe fleet (number 10) was chartered on January 23, 1934, by the Snipe Class International Racing Association (SCIRA). In 1938, Charles Gabor won for the fleet the Commodore Hub E. Isaacks Trophy and by 1939 there were fifty-two Snipes in the fleet. In 1940, Kenneth Heitman won the National Junior Championship.

Soon after the Snipes came the Lightnings, another historical fleet chartered by the International Lightning Class Association (ILCA) as fleet #25.

==Lake==

Lake Mohawk is an reservoir located primarily in Sparta Township and extending into Byram Township of Sussex County, New Jersey. It is the source of the Wallkill River, which then flows north to Rondout Creek in New York. In 1924, the Arthur D. Crane Company acquired of land at the headwaters of the river. This area was previously known as &quot;Brogden&#x27;s Meadow.&quot; A 600-foot dam on the Wallkill River was begun in 1926. The lake was filled in 1928. The dam was privately constructed by the developers Arthur D. Crane and Herbert L. Closs. They controlled the development, sales, and rentals of the entire community.

Soon after the construction of the lake, in the mid- to late 1930s, one of the architects was staying with his family in a seaplane on the lake. A fire broke out on the seaplane. While they escaped by boat, the plane sank to the bottom of the lake. In the late 1990s an Italian team attempted salvage, but according to their reports, the wreck was too deteriorated to be recovered.

==Historic district==

The White Deer Plaza and Boardwalk District is a historic district encompassing the Lake Mohawk section of Sparta Township along White Deer Plaza, Winona Parkway, and West Shore Trail. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 25, 1988 for its significance in architecture, commerce, and community planning. The district includes 18 contributing buildings, 8 contributing structures, and one contributing site.

<text>Montague Township is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, in the New York City Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 3,792, a decrease of 55 (−1.4%) from the 2010 census count of 3,847, which in turn reflected an increase of 435 (+12.7%) from the 3,412 counted in the 2000 census. High Point, within Montague Township, is the highest elevation within New Jersey at an altitude of above sea level. It is the northernmost town in New Jersey.

Most of the area of Montague Township is public lands, primarily High Point State Park, Stokes State Forest, and Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. Montague is known for its scenery and wildlife; summer sports in the area include hiking, biking, camping (both public and private campgrounds are available), and fishing.

The derivation of the township&#x27;s name is uncertain, though suggestions include that it was named after the George Montagu, 4th Duke of Manchester, as suggested by King George II, who approved the royal patent on March 26, 1759; for Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, an author who was popular at the time; or for solicitor John Montague. Montague was incorporated on February 21, 1798, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships.

The township borders both New York and Pennsylvania, the only municipality in New Jersey to border both states; it is a rural community that does not have any traffic lights. Before Montague Township was granted its own post office in the 1980s, residents had all of their mail delivered through the 12771 ZIP code for Port Jervis, New York, leading to situations where residents had New Jersey driver&#x27;s licenses with a New York State mailing address.

One U.S., state, and major county route each traverses the township. U.S. Route 206 passes through in the western part and crosses the Delaware River at the Milford-Montague Toll Bridge. Route 23 passes through the eastern part and serves as the entrance road to High Point State Park and ends at the New York border just south of Interstate 84. County Route 521 enters Montague concurrent with US 206, separates from US 206 just south of the Milford-Montague Toll Bridge, then heads northeast through the northwest portion of the township before ending at the New York state boundary.

The closest limited access road is Interstate 84 and is immediately over the state line in Deerpark, New York.

In the northernmost section of the township along Route 23, there are several gasoline stations, most likely because gas had historically been significantly less expensive in New Jersey than in Matamoras, Pennsylvania or Port Jervis, New York.

<doc id="125761" wikidata="Q1089234" url="?curid=125761" title="Newton, New Jersey">
<text>Newton, officially the &quot;Town of Newton&quot;, is an incorporated municipality and the county seat of Sussex County in the U.S. state of New Jersey, situated approximately northwest of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 8,374, its highest decennial population ever, an increase of 377 (+4.7%) from the 2010 census count of 7,997, which in turn reflected a decrease of 247 (−3.0%) from the 8,244 counted in the 2000 census.

One of 15 municipalities in the state organized as a town, the municipal government operates under a council-manager structure provided by the Faulkner Act, or Optional Municipal Charter Law. Newton was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 11, 1864, from portions of Newton Township, which was also partitioned to create Andover Township and Hampton Township, and was then dissolved. Additional land was acquired from Andover Township in 1869 and 1927, and from Fredon Township in 1920.

==History==
===In the eighteenth century===
Newton is located near the headwaters of the east branch of the Paulins Kill, a tributary of the Delaware River. In October 1715, Colonial surveyor Samuel Green plotted a tract of at the head of the Paulins Kill, then known as the &quot;Tohokenetcunck River&quot;, on behalf of William Penn. This tract, which would not be settled for approximately 30–35 years, was part of the survey and division of the last acquisition of Native American land by the West Jersey Board of Proprietors. At the time of Green&#x27;s survey, northwestern New Jersey was populated with bands of the Munsee, the northern branch of the Lenape Native Americans.

The first recorded European settler within the boundaries of present-day Newton was a German Palatine immigrant named Henry Hairlocker who arrived sometime before 1751 when he appears in Morris County records as receiving a tavern license. The &quot;Newtown Precinct&quot;, a large township, was created in 1751, and Sussex County was created from Morris two years later on June 8, 1753. The township would be named &quot;Newtown&quot; after the colonial village of Newtown in Queens, New York from where the Pettit family originated (the six Pettit brothers, all prominent landowners and influential figures in early local government, settled in northwestern New Jersey in the 1740s) or from its status as a &quot;new town&quot;.

In 1762, Jonathan Hampton, of Elizabethtown, surveyed the location for a county courthouse and town green at the intersection of a military supply road he built during the French and Indian War and a major north–south artery called the King&#x27;s Highway (present-day New Jersey Route 94). The construction of the courthouse was completed in 1765 and the village that developed around it became known as &quot;Sussex Court House&quot;. The county courthouse was the site of a raid by British partisan Lieutenant James Moody during the American Revolution.

In 1797, the village&#x27;s post office was renamed &quot;Newtown&quot; and later, in 1825, the spelling was altered to &quot;Newton&quot;. Newton Township would cede land to create new townships on several occasions in the eighteenth and nineteenth-centuries, until a final division dissolved the township on April 11, 1864, through a legislative act of New Jersey Legislature that created the village of Newton as an incorporated town and two rural townships—Hampton and Andover.

==Historic district==
The Newton Town Plot Historic District is a historic district encompassing the Town Plot section of Newton, along Church, High, Main, Moran, and Spring Streets; and Park Place. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 12, 1992, for its significance in architecture, commerce, community planning, settlement, and politics from 1762 to 1941. The district includes 51 contributing buildings, three contributing objects, and two contributing sites. It includes the Sussex County Courthouse, which was added individually to the NRHP in 1979 and the Hill Memorial, added in 1985. The Sussex and Merchants National Bank was built in 1927 with Georgian Revival style and some Beaux Arts ornamentation. The Old Newton Burial Ground, established 1762, is a contributing site. It features a bas relief of Father Time on the cast-iron entrance gates.

==Geography==
===Geological features===
Newton is located in the Kittatinny Valley, a segment of the Great Appalachian Valley. The Great Appalachian Valley is a gigantic trough—a chain of valley lowlands that stretches about from Quebec to Alabama and is the easternmost edge of Ridge and Valley Appalachians physiographic province. This physiographic province, one of five in New Jersey, occupies approximately two-thirds of the county&#x27;s area (the county&#x27;s western and central sections) dominated by Kittatinny Mountain and the Kittatinny Valley. This province&#x27;s contour is characterized by long, even ridges with long, continuous valleys in between that generally run parallel from southwest to northeast. The features of the Ridge and Valley province were created approximately 300–400 million years ago during the Ordovician period and Appalachian orogeny—a period of tremendous pressure and rock thrusting that caused the creation of the Appalachian Mountains. This region is largely formed by sedimentary rock.

Newton&#x27;s land area drains into the watersheds of the Paulins Kill and Pequest River—two rivers that are tributaries of the Delaware River. These watersheds are separated by slate ridges that are part of the Martinsburg Formation. These slate ridges were quarried for slate for roofs and other industrial purposes beginning with a quarry opened by Elijah Blackwell in 1859 that operated under a series of different owners and commercial entities until 1930.

===Political geography===
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of , including of land and of water (0.65%).

The Town of Newton is bordered to the north and east by Hampton Township, to the west by Fredon Township, and to the south by Andover Township.

===Climate and weather===

Because of its location in the higher elevations of northwestern New Jersey&#x27;s Appalachian mountains, Newton, as well as the rest of Sussex County, has a cooler humid continental climate or microthermal climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) which indicates patterns of significant precipitation in all seasons and at least four months where the average temperature rises above This differs from the rest of the state which is generally a humid mesothermal climate, in which temperatures range between during the year&#x27;s coldest month.

<doc id="125764" wikidata="Q599251" url="?curid=125764" title="Sparta, New Jersey">
<text>Sparta is a township in Sussex County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 19,600, a decrease of 122 (−0.6%) from the 2010 census count of 19,722, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,642 (+9.1%) from the 18,080 counted in the 2000 census.

Sparta was organized as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 14, 1845, from portions of Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hardyston Township and (the now-defunct) Newton Township. The township was named after the existing community of Sparta, which had been settled and named years before, the name likely coming from Sparta, Greece. Ogdensburg borough was incorporated on February 26, 1914, from portions of Sparta Township.

The township was listed as the safest place in New Jersey as well as the seventh safest municipality in the nation according to a 2022 crime statistic compilation from Safewise.com.

==History==

===Overview===
Sparta was originally inhabited by Lenape Native Americans. In the 1750s, Dutch explorers discovered red ores in the area and attempted to mine copper. No permanent settlers arrived until 1778, when Robert Ogden and his wife built their home and constructed an iron forge on lands he had acquired and &quot;called their house and farm Sparta.&quot; The first public building in Sparta was the Presbyterian Church which was incorporated in 1786. Schools were established in Ogdensburg by 1806 and in Sparta by 1812.

Iron, zinc, and limestone supported a mining industry for over 100 years, but today the mining operations have ceased and the township is now a residential community served by retail, professional, and service small businesses. According to the 2000 census, 65% of Sparta workers commute to jobs outside of the county. 

===Mining industry===

====Iron====
Robert Ogden settled in 1778 near the present town of Ogdensburg and built an iron forge, utilizing local ore from his Ogden Mine on Sparta Mountain. The Horseshoe mine was opened in 1772 by the Englishmen Spargo and Harvey who shipped ore by horse and mule to the forges at Sparta and Hopewell. It wasn&#x27;t until 1868 that the Ogden Mine Railroad began operations and made it economical to ship zinc and iron ore to Nolan&#x27;s Point on Lake Hopatcong where the Morris Canal had a marine terminal that could ship ore to Newark. In 1872, the New Jersey Midland Railroad (later known as the New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western) extended to Ogdensburg and captured the zinc ore traffic.

In 1836, Henry Decker, along with Nelson Hunt and Lewis Sherman, began the manufacture of anchors at their forges in Sparta. Their success led to a small industry of forging anchors in Sparta, but by the end of the Civil War the forge industry in Sparta had come to an end.

In 1889, Thomas Edison invested $3.5 million in his Edison Ore-Milling Company to build iron operations on of Sparta Mountain. Edison hoped to concentrate the mountain&#x27;s vast quantities of low-grade ore and supply East Coast mills with raw material. At its peak Edison&#x27;s operation employed 500 people, but after a 10-year effort he abandoned his attempt to compete with more economical ores from Minnesota&#x27;s Mesabi Iron Range. The availability of the cheap Minnesota ores put an end to iron mining in Sparta.

====Zinc====
In 1848 the New Jersey Zinc Company began operations at Sterling Hill. Earlier attempts to obtain iron from the mineral rich ore of the Sterling Hill failed because of manganese contamination, but zinc was recoverable and the ores at Sterling Hill were rich with it.

In 1856 the Passaic Zinc Company started operations at the Sterling Hill Mine and constructed large ore crushers, shipping the ores to the company&#x27;s plant in Jersey City.

By 1868, both iron and zinc operations were in progress at Sterling Hill, but the numerous companies and claims were embroiled in continuous legal battles, the largest of which was a 12-year dispute between the New Jersey Zinc Company and the Franklin Iron Company over rights to mixed ores, each company having purchased the right to mine zinc and iron, respectively. In 1880, the Franklin Iron Company acquired the New Jersey Zinc Company&#x27;s operations at Sterling Hill mine, ending the dispute. Large scale operations began in 1897 when the claims were consolidated under the New Jersey Zinc Company and by 1900 its mill was processing 1,500 tons of ore daily.

Zinc operations continued until 1986 when the Sterling Hill mine ceased operation. The Sterling Hill mine site is currently occupied by the Sterling Hill Mining Museum and is open to the public for tours.

====Limestone====
After closing his iron operations, Thomas Edison recouped his losses by opening a quarry called Limecrest near Sparta in 1919. The lime quarry fed Edison&#x27;s Portland cement operations, and was in continuous operation under various owners for more than 80 years until it closed in 2003. During the years of its operation the limestone quarry was an important source of employment and tax revenue for Sparta. Limestone is no longer mined, but a limited amount of granite continues to be quarried by a handful of employees.

===Tourism===

The New Jersey Midland Railroad opened to Ogdensburg in 1872 for zinc ore traffic, but in 1882 the line was extended to Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and a station was built at Sparta, giving tourists easy access to the many boarding houses that served summer residents from the cities. Passenger service ended in 1935, but by then Sparta was well established as a summer destination. In 1926, the Arthur D. Crane Company along with developer and designer Herbert L. Closs constructed a dam across the Wallkill River to form Lake Mohawk in 1928. The private resort community created by the Crane Company consisted primarily of summer homes, but the homes began to be winterized in the 1940s and the current membership of 2,600 families are largely year-round residents.

==Demographics==
Sparta has been noted for the high number of pilots and their families who settle in the area. In his 1994 book &quot;The Airport: Terminal Nights and Runway Days at John F. Kennedy International&quot;, James Kaplan describes the home township of an interviewee as &quot;thickly populated, for no particular reason, with pilots, many of whom do their flying out of Kennedy. The view out [the pilot&#x27;s] picture window is of trees ... The lights and noise of Manhattan, fifty miles distant, attract flight attendants, single people mostly. Pilots like the woods.&quot;

<doc id="125766" wikidata="Q1073793" url="?curid=125766" title="Stillwater Township, New Jersey">
<text>Stillwater Township is a township located in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Situated in the Kittatinny Valley, Stillwater is a rural farming community with a long history of dairy farming. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 4,004, a decrease of 95 (−2.3%) from the 2010 census count of 4,099, which in turn reflected a decrease of 168 (−3.9%) from the 4,267 counted in the 2000 census.

Stillwater was settled in the eighteenth century by Palatine German immigrants who entered through the port of Philadelphia. In 1741, Casper Shafer, John George Wintermute (Windemuth), and their father-in-law Johan Peter Bernhardt settled along the Paulins Kill. For the next 50 years, the village of Stillwater was essentially German, centered on a union church shared by Lutheran and German Reformed (Calvinist) congregations. The German population assimilated by the early nineteenth century, but evidence of their settlement remains in the architecture of the grist mills, lime kilns, and stone houses located throughout the valley. Stillwater was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on December 27, 1824, from portions of Hardwick Township when Sussex County was divided in half by the legislature a few weeks earlier to create Warren County. Portions of the township were taken to form Fredon Township on February 24, 1904.

In 2008, &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Stillwater Township as its 40th best place to live in its annual rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

==History==

The township was created on December 27, 1824, by an act passed by the New Jersey Legislature.

A prominent structure in the area&#x27;s history is the Shafer Grist Mill. Originally built by Casper Shafer in 1741, it was moved approximately a half mile to its present location in 1764. It was rebuilt in 1844 and powered by water from the Paulins Kill. Casper&#x27;s son, Nathan Armstrong Shafer lived in Whitehall Manor, which he built near what is now the center of the village. The gristmill operated commercially until 1955, making it one of the oldest, continuously operating, water-powered gristmills in the State of New Jersey. Aline Murray Kilmer, the widow of poet Joyce Kilmer, lived the last decade of her life at Whitehall, passing away there on October 1, 1941.

In the early 1900s, Swartswood Lake became a major resort. Weekenders took the train into nearby Blairstown through the 1940s to stay at such places as the North Shore Inn, The Casino, and The Dove Island Inn (now a private home). Later, summer cabins became popular with Brooklyn weekenders.

The Stillwater creamery was built in 1910. Borden, Inc. later took control of the creamery.

In the 1920s, the Paulins Kill was dammed to create Paulins Kill Lake and many summer residences sprang up. These summer cottages have grown into what is now a year-round community.

The Presbyterian Church is the most prominent feature in Stillwater village. Opposite the church is the former Academy, an old schoolhouse that is now home of the Historical Society of Stillwater Township. Stillwater was, and still is, primarily agricultural. The area is dotted with lime kilns, which used to burn lime to enrich the soil, but are now obsolete, becoming lost to history and the overgrowth of vegetation. An intact kiln still exists on Millbrook Road, a little more than two miles (3 km) from Stillwater village.

Roughly one-third of Stillwater Township&#x27;s area was ceded to create Fredon Township in 1904.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 28.25 square miles (73.17 km2), including 26.92 square miles (69.73 km2) of land and 1.33 square miles (3.43 km2) of water (4.69%).

The township borders the municipalities of Fredon Township, Hampton Township and Walpack Township in Sussex County; and both Frelinghuysen Township and Hardwick Township in Warren County.

===Neighborhoods===

Crandon Lakes (with a 2010 Census population of 496 in Stillwater Township, out of a CDP total of 1,178) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) split between Hampton Township and Stillwater Township.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Catfish Pond, Duck Pond, Fairview Lake, Five Points, Lake Kathryn, Middleville, Mud Pond, Paulins Kill Lake, Quick Pond, Stillwater, Swartswood, Swartswood Lake and Wintermutes Foundry.
Stillwater is a small one-street village in the area that was first settled by Johan Peter Bernhardt and his two sons-in-law, John George Wintermute and Casper Shafer. At the western terminus of end of Main Street where it meets County Route 521, the First Presbyterian Church of Stillwater is the dominant feature. As Main Street travels east, the Garris&#x27;s General Store (1876), &quot;Whitehall&quot; (built in 1785 by Abraham Shafer), Casper Shafer&#x27;s stonehouse (), crossing the Paulins Kill near Shafer&#x27;s grist mill (1764, 1844) and miller&#x27;s house. An 1820 hostelry, the Stillwater Inn, recently was destroyed by fire. One half-mile (800 m) south of the Presbyterian church, is John George Wintermute&#x27;s stonehouse (1755), his son Peter&#x27;s stonehouse (1791). Located adjacent is Stillwater Cemetery—the site of the original Lutheran-Calvinist union church (1771–1838), the graves of the towns earliest settlers, and many eighteenth century ethnic German gravestones.

===Geology===
Flanked to the west by Kittatinny Mountain, the Stillwater Township is located within the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province, and the entire township is within the Kittatinny Valley a region of rolling hills and flat valley floors that is a section of the larger Great Appalachian Valley running from eastern Canada to northern Alabama. Elevations in this valley range from . According to Snell, &quot;The surface of the country is generally uneven and hilly, and on the west exceedingly rugged and mountainous. Ponds and watercourses abound. Of the latter, the most important is the Paulinskill, a millstream of considerable consequence.&quot; All of Stillwater Township is located in the Paulins Kill watershed which flows southwest through Sussex and Warren counties before joining the Delaware River near Columbia, New Jersey. The valley floor is part of the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation (shale and slate) which make up most of the valley—and the Jacksonburg Formation (mostly limestone).

===Climate===

Stillwater Township is located in Northwestern New Jersey which has a humid continental climate (microthermal)—a cooler climate due to its higher elevations.

The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting held during the first week of January, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor.

<text>Sussex is a borough in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 2,024, a decrease of 106 (−5.0%) from the 2010 census count of 2,130, which in turn reflected a decline of 15 (−0.7%) from the 2,145 counted in the 2000 census.

Sussex was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on October 14, 1891, as Deckertown, from portions of Wantage Township. The borough&#x27;s original name was for settler Peter Decker. The borough was renamed Sussex on March 2, 1902. The county and borough are named for the historic county of Sussex in England.

A joint commission of residents of both Sussex and Wantage had recommended that the two communities should be consolidated to form what would be called the Township of Sussex-Wantage, which would operate within the Faulkner Act under the council-manager form of government, with a mayor and a six-member township council, and that voters in both municipalities should approve a referendum to be held on November 3, 2009. The committee noted that the two municipalities share common issues, schools, library and community services and that the artificial nature of the octagonal Sussex border often made it hard to distinguish between the two.

<text>Vernon Township is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located about a one hour drive from New York City and is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 22,358, a decrease of 1,585 (−6.6%) from the 2010 census count of 23,943, which in turn reflected a decline of 743 (−3.0%) from the 24,686 counted in the 2000 census. It is both the most populous municipality and the largest in area in the county.

Vernon is home to Mountain Creek (formerly Great Gorge and Vernon Valley), a ski resort and water park as well as the Crystal Springs Resort&#x27;s Minerals Hotel and Elements Spa. The Hidden Valley ski resort, which opened in 1976 and occupied a property that included one of New Jersey&#x27;s three remaining downhill skiing facilities, closed at the end of the 2013 season and could find no buyers at an auction held that year; it has since reopened as the National Winter Activity Center. The Great Gorge Playboy Club was located in the Vernon community of McAfee, but was sold and turned into a hotel called the Legends Resort &amp; Country Club. Opened in 1972 at a cost of $20 million (equivalent to $ million in ), featuring 700 rooms and 27 holes of golf, the hotel was sold to Americana in 1982 and later was resold to Metairie Corp. which branded the property as the Legends Resort and Country Club. In 2017, the township started eviction proceedings against low-income residents who had been living in the defunct resort on a permanent basis.

==History==
The independent township of Vernon was established on April 8, 1793, from portions of Hardyston Township, and the township was formally incorporated on February 21, 1798. The which marked the town&#x27;s borders over 200 years ago have not changed since. However, the population of Vernon, which was 1,548 people as recently as 1950, has steadily grown since the 1960s, when the ski industry was introduced to the area. Additional growth has come as home prices have soared in the inner suburbs of New York City and property buyers seek the better values available from real estate developments in the area.

Iron mining in the town of Vernon was prevalent during the mid-to-late 19th century. Mines such as the Canistear Mine, Williams Mine, and the Pochuk Mine created industry which spawned local businesses, and brought rail travel to the town.

It is not known how Vernon Township got its name, but a number of theories have been offered by author Ronald J. Dupont Jr.:

*Admiral Edward Vernon. Dupont writes that this is very possible because of two things: 1. the township was created in 1792, the year that George Washington was reelected as president, and 2. because Vernon Township&#x27;s first Masonic Lodge in 1820 was named Mount Vernon (Washington was also a Freemason during his life), likely after Washington&#x27;s Virginia residence. The residence, in turn, got its name because Washington&#x27;s brother Lawrence Washington served with Admiral Vernon.
*A family named Vernon. Not likely, Dupont says, although he notes that a Nathaniel Vernon was a licensed tavernkeeper in Sussex County in 1756. However, the tavern was likely elsewhere, and not in what is now Vernon.
*The Latin root &quot;Vernus.&quot; One form of &quot;vernus&quot; is &quot;vernal,&quot; as in vernal equinox (&quot;spring&quot;), and so Vernon &quot;had connotations of spring: green, lush, fresh, fertile, etc., and hence was an attractive name for a place.&quot;

Dupont Jr. also writes that in the late 19th century &quot;two&quot; places named Vernon existed, one in Sussex County and another in Essex County. When the Essex County community was granted a post office, they found out that another Vernon existed, and so they eventually named the community Verona.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 69.96 square miles (181.19 km2), including 67.60 square miles (175.07 km2) of land and 2.36 square miles (6.12 km2) of water (3.38%).

The township&#x27;s largest housing complex is Great Gorge Village. Originally built as a slope-side vacation housing development with 1,356 units, the village is no longer affiliated with the ski resort and is operated by real estate investor Andrew Mulvihill. Village residents, who pay $5.5 million in condominium fees to cover services, have argued that Mulvihill and affiliated businesses have used their control of the community&#x27;s board of directors to direct contracts to affiliated vendors.

==Government==

===Local government===
In a November 2010 referendum, 70% of voters approved a change from the Faulkner Act (council–manager) form of government to the mayor–council form. Under the new plan, a mayor directly elected by the voters oversees the day-to-day operation of the township with the aid of a business manager, subject to the oversight of a five-member Township Council. The Mayor and Council took office after elections in May 2011, replacing the previously existing council. The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. Under the terms of an ordinance passed in August 2011, the township&#x27;s elections were shifted from May to November, with the council citing savings from eliminating the standalone municipal election.

The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the five-member Township Council, who are directly elected by the voters on an at-large basis to staggered four-year terms of office on a non-partisan basis, with either two or three seats up for election in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election. Three council seats come up for election together and the two other council seats and the mayoral seat are up for vote together two years later. Under the current plan, Vernon has a &quot;strong mayor&quot; system of government in which the mayor heads the executive branch, overseeing township functions, enforcing all ordinances and other regulations, appoints department heads and prepares a budget, with the assistance of a business administrator. The Township Council is the legislative branch, responsible for enacting ordinances, approving the mayor&#x27;s department head appointments, can remove employees for cause and can modify the mayor&#x27;s budget by majority vote, though budget increases require a ⅔ majority. The mayor has the option to attend and speak at council meetings but is not given a vote.

, the Mayor is Anthony L. Rossi, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Vernon Township Council are Council President Patrick Rizzuto (2025), Council Vice President Natalie Buccieri (2025), Jessica DeBenedetto (2025; elected to serve an unexpired term), William J. Higgins (2027) and Bradley D. Sparta (2027).

In February 2023, Peg Distasi was appointed to the seat expiring in December 2025 that had been held by Bryan Lynch; the seat will come up for election in November 2023 for the balance of the term. In the November 2023 general election, Jessica DeBenedetto was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

In November 2022, the council appointed Joe Tadrick to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Harry Shortway the previous month due to health issues.

In October 2021, the Township Council selected Michael Furrey to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Kelly Weller until she stepped down from office earlier that month after announcing that she was moving out of the township. Furrey served on an interim basis until the November 2022 general election, when Bradley D. Sparta was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

The Township Council selected Toni Cilli in January 2021 to fill the seat held by Jean Murphy running to December 2021.

Andrew Pitsker took office in July 2020 after being chosen to fill the seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held until Mark Van Tassel left office the previous month. Pitsker served on an interim basis until the November 2020 general election, when he was elected to serve the remainder of the term.

Four members of the governing body were elected in May 2011 and took office on July 1, 2011, Jean Murphy was elected in November 2014 just beating Edward Dunn.

<text>In physics and chemistry, binding energy is the smallest amount of energy required to remove a particle from a system of particles or to disassemble a system of particles into individual parts. In the former meaning the term is predominantly used in condensed matter physics, atomic physics, and chemistry, whereas in nuclear physics the term &quot;separation energy&quot; is used. A bound system is typically at a lower energy level than its unbound constituents. According to relativity theory, a decrease in the total energy of a system is accompanied by a decrease in the total mass, where .

==Types==
There are several types of binding energy, each operating over a different distance and energy scale. The smaller the size of a bound system, the higher its associated binding energy.

==Mass–energy relation==

A bound system is typically at a lower energy level than its unbound constituents because its mass must be less than the total mass of its unbound constituents. For systems with low binding energies, this &quot;lost&quot; mass after binding may be fractionally small, whereas for systems with high binding energies, the missing mass may be an easily measurable fraction. This missing mass may be lost during the process of binding as energy in the form of heat or light, with the removed energy corresponding to the removed mass through Einstein&#x27;s equation . In the process of binding, the constituents of the system might enter higher energy states of the nucleus/atom/molecule while retaining their mass, and because of this, it is necessary that they are removed from the system before its mass can decrease. Once the system cools to normal temperatures and returns to ground states regarding energy levels, it will contain less mass than when it first combined and was at high energy. This loss of heat represents the &quot;mass deficit&quot;, and the heat itself retains the mass that was lost (from the point of view of the initial system). This mass will appear in any other system that absorbs the heat and gains thermal energy.

For example, if two objects are attracting each other in space through their gravitational field, the attraction force accelerates the objects, increasing their velocity, which converts their potential energy (gravity) into kinetic energy. When the particles either pass through each other without interaction or elastically repel during the collision, the gained kinetic energy (related to speed) begins to revert into potential energy, driving the collided particles apart. The decelerating particles will return to the initial distance and beyond into infinity, or stop and repeat the collision (oscillation takes place). This shows that the system, which loses no energy, does not combine (bind) into a solid object, parts of which oscillate at short distances. Therefore, to bind the particles, the kinetic energy gained due to the attraction must be dissipated by resistive force. Complex objects in collision ordinarily undergo inelastic collision, transforming some kinetic energy into internal energy (heat content, which is atomic movement), which is further radiated in the form of photonsthe light and heat. Once the energy to escape the gravity is dissipated in the collision, the parts will oscillate at a closer, possibly atomic, distance, thus looking like one solid object. This lost energy, necessary to overcome the potential barrier to separate the objects, is the binding energy. If this binding energy were retained in the system as heat, its mass would not decrease, whereas binding energy lost from the system as heat radiation would itself have mass. It directly represents the &quot;mass deficit&quot; of the cold, bound system.

Closely analogous considerations apply in chemical and nuclear reactions. Exothermic chemical reactions in closed systems do not change mass, but do become less massive once the heat of reaction is removed, though this mass change is too small to measure with standard equipment. In nuclear reactions, the fraction of mass that may be removed as light or heat, i.e. binding energy, is often a much larger fraction of the system mass. It may thus be measured directly as a mass difference between rest masses of reactants and (cooled) products. This is because nuclear forces are comparatively stronger than the Coulombic forces associated with the interactions between electrons and protons that generate heat in chemistry.

===Mass change===
Mass change (decrease) in bound systems, particularly atomic nuclei, has also been termed &quot;mass defect&quot;, &quot;mass deficit&quot;, or mass &quot;packing fraction&quot;.

The difference between the unbound system calculated mass and experimentally measured mass of nucleus (mass change) is denoted as Δ&quot;m&quot;. It can be calculated as follows:
:Mass change = (unbound system calculated mass) − (measured mass of system)
:: e.g. (sum of masses of protons and neutrons) − (measured mass of nucleus)

After a nuclear reaction occurs that results in an excited nucleus, the energy that must be radiated or otherwise removed as binding energy in order to decay to the unexcited state may be in one of several forms. This may be electromagnetic waves, such as gamma radiation; the kinetic energy of an ejected particle, such as an electron, in internal conversion decay; or partly as the rest mass of one or more emitted particles, such as the particles of beta decay. No mass deficit can appear, in theory, until this radiation or this energy has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.

When nucleons bind together to form a nucleus, they must lose a small amount of mass, i.e. there is a change in mass to stay bound. This mass change must be released as various types of photon or other particle energy as above, according to the relation . Thus, after the binding energy has been removed, binding energy = mass change × . This energy is a measure of the forces that hold the nucleons together. It represents energy that must be resupplied from the environment for the nucleus to be broken up into individual nucleons.

For example, an atom of deuterium has a mass defect of 0.0023884 Da, and its binding energy is nearly equal to 2.23 MeV. This means that energy of 2.23 MeV is required to disintegrate an atom of deuterium.

The energy given off during either nuclear fusion or nuclear fission is the difference of the binding energies of the &quot;fuel&quot;, i.e. the initial nuclide(s), from that of the fission or fusion products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, which uses previous measurements of the atomic masses of known nuclides, which always have the same mass for each species.

<text>Walpack Township is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 7, a decrease of 9 (−56.3%) from the 2010 census count of 16, which in turn reflected a decline of 34 (−82.9%) from the 41 counted in the 2000 census. Walpack Township was the smallest municipality by population and one of only four municipalities in New Jersey with a population under 100 as of the 2020 Census; it had the state&#x27;s third-smallest population in the 2010 census, behind Tavistock (population 5) and the now-defunct Pine Valley (population 12), both in Camden County.

The township is named from a corruption of the Lenape Native American content word &quot;wahlpeck,&quot; which means &quot;turn-hole,&quot; or an eddy or whirlpool, a compound of two Native American words, &quot;woa-lac&quot; (a hole), and &quot;tuppeck&quot; (a pool), though other sources attribute the name to mean &quot;very deep water&quot; or &quot;sudden bend of a stream around the base of a rock&quot;.

==History==

Walpack Township dates back to October 26, 1731, when it was first mentioned as &quot;Walpake&quot; in Hunterdon County. The area covered by the present-day township was set off to Morris County upon that county&#x27;s creation in 1739, and became part of the newly formed Sussex County in 1753. As of April 15, 1754, Walpack&#x27;s boundaries were defined as a &quot;precinct&quot;. Walpack was formally incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form Montague Township (March 26, 1759), Sandyston Township (February 26, 1762) and the now-defunct Pahaquarry Township in Warren County (December 27, 1824). Territory was gained from Stillwater Township in 1935.

The Andrew Snable House was built in 1801 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 23, 1979. The Wallpack Center Historic District was added to the NRHP on July 17, 1980.

In 1962, following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Connie and Diane in 1955, a proposal was made by Congress for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to alleviate flooding on the Delaware River by constructing a dam at the site of Tocks Island. This dam, south of Walpack, would have created a lake roughly long and wide. Over the next 15 years, approximately of the surrounding land, including Walpack, were claimed under eminent domain by the government for this project, and many long-time area residents were forced to move out. However, the dam and lake were never actually built: 

As the Vietnam War strained federal budgets, the dam project stalled due to persistent concerns about the stability of soil beneath it, rising costs, new environmental laws and local activism. In 1978, Congress protected sections of the Delaware River under the Wild and Scenic River Act, killing the project.

Judge Joseph Stamler of New Jersey Superior Court rejected a proposal for a six-day rock festival to be held in the summer of 1970 on a site in the township, leading to the passage of standards for similar events that requires planning for traffic and safety between the organizers and local authorities, and sets limits on duration. Stamler stated that any positive benefits from such an event must be weighed against the &quot;health, safety and welfare of the young, and the potential harm to the public&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 24.88 square miles (64.45 km2), including 24.24 square miles (62.77 km2) of land and 0.65 square miles (1.68 km2) of water (2.60%). The township is located in the Minisink Valley that extends from the Delaware Water Gap north to Port Jervis, New York.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Dry Pond, Flat Brook, Flatbrookville, Haneys Mill, Harding Lake, Long Pond and Walpack Center.

<text>Berkeley Heights is a township in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located on a ridge in northern-central New Jersey, Berkeley Heights is a commuter town of New York City in the New York metropolitan area, nestled within the Raritan Valley region and also bordering both Morris and Somerset counties in the Passaic Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 13,285, an increase of 102 (+0.8%) from the 2010 census count of 13,183, which in turn reflected a decline of 224 (−1.7%) from the 13,407 counted in the 2000 census.

The township was originally incorporated as New Providence Township by the New Jersey Legislature on November 8, 1809, from portions of Springfield Township, while the area was still part of Essex County. New Providence Township became part of the newly formed Union County at its creation on March 19, 1857. Portions of the township were taken on March 23, 1869, to create Summit, and on March 14, 1899, to form the borough of New Providence. On November 6, 1951, the name of the township was changed to Berkeley Heights, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The township was named for John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, one of the founders of the Province of New Jersey.

The township has been ranked as one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, township residents had a median household income of $147,614, ranked 15th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, almost double the statewide median of $76,475.

The township was listed as the fifth safest place in New Jersey as well as the ninth safest municipality in the nation according to a 2022 crime statistic compilation from Safewise.com.

==History==
The Lenape Native Americans were known to inhabit the region, including the area now known as Berkeley Heights, dating back to the 1524 voyage of Giovanni da Verrazzano to what is now Lower New York Bay.

The earliest construction in Berkeley Heights began in an area that is now part of the Watchung Reservation, a Union County park that includes of the township.

The first European settler was Peter Willcox, who received a land grant in 1720 from the Elizabethtown Associates. This group bought much of northern New Jersey from the Lenape in the late 17th century. Willcox built a grist and lumber mill across Green Brook.

In 1793, a regional government was formed. It encompassed the area from present-day Springfield Township, Summit, New Providence, and Berkeley Heights, and was called Springfield Township. Growth continued in the area, and by 1809, Springfield Township divided into Springfield Township and New Providence Township, which included present day Summit, New Providence, and Berkeley Heights.

In 1845, Willcox&#x27;s heirs sold the mill to David Felt, a paper manufacturer from New York. Felt built a small village around the mill aptly named Feltville. It included homes for workers and their families, dormitories, orchards, a post office and a general store with a second floor church.
In 1860, Feltville was sold to sarsaparilla makers. Other manufacturing operations continued until Feltville went into bankruptcy in 1882. When residents moved away, the area became known as Deserted Village. Village remains consist of seven houses, a store, the mill and a barn. Deserted Village is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is undergoing restoration by the Union County Parks Department. Restoration grants of almost $2 million were received from various state agencies. Deserted Village, in the Watchung Reservation, is open daily for unguided walking tours during daylight hours.

On March 23, 1869, Summit Township (now the City of Summit) seceded from New Providence Township. On March 14, 1899, the Borough of New Providence seceded from New Providence Township. Present day Berkeley Heights remained as New Providence Township. Many of the townships and regional areas in New Jersey were separating into small, locally governed communities at that time due to acts of the New Jersey Legislature that made it economically advantageous for the communities to do so.

Due to confusion between the adjacent municipalities of the Borough of New Providence and the Township of New Providence, the township conducted a referendum in 1952 and voted to change the name to Berkeley Heights Township. The origin of the township&#x27;s name has never been fully established, but is believed to have been taken from an area of town that was referred to by this moniker, which itself was assumed to be derived from Lord John Berkeley, who was co-proprietor of New Jersey from 1664 to 1674.

Early life in Berkeley Heights is documented in the Littell-Lord Farmhouse Museum &amp; Farmstead (31 Horseshoe Road in Berkeley Heights), an museum surrounding two houses, one of which was built and the other near the start of the 19th century. Among the exhibits are a Victorian master bedroom and a Victorian children&#x27;s room, furnished with period antiques. The children&#x27;s room also has reproductions of antique toys, which visitors can play with. The museum, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, also includes an outbuilding that was used as a summer kitchen, a corn crib dating to the 19th century and a spring house built around a spring and used for refrigeration. The museum is open 2-4 p.m. on the third Sunday of each month from April through December, or by appointment.

The township owes its rural character to its late development. Until 1941, when the American Telephone and Telegraph Company built the AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories research facility in the township, it was a sleepy farming and resort community.

Berkeley Heights is host to a traditional religious procession and feast carried out by members of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Society. The feast is capped by one of the largest fireworks shows in the state. The Feast of Mt. Carmel has been a town tradition since 1909.

In 1958, part of a Nike missile battery (NY-73) was installed in Berkeley Heights. The missiles were located in nearby Mountainside, while the radar station was installed in Berkeley Heights. It remained in operation until 1963, and remnants of the site are located adjacent to Governor Livingston High School.

In 1960, the town’s seal was created via a contest in which local students could enter a design, and the best of these was officially named the seal, through an announcement on June 17, at Columbia Middle School. Patricia Jean Taylor created the winning design, which was chosen from a pool of 150 entries.

===Free Acres===
Another early Berkeley Heights community of note is the Free Acres, established in 1910 by Bolton Hall, a New York entrepreneur and reformer who believed in the idea of Henry George, the economist, of single taxation, under which residents pay tax to the community, which, in turn, pays a lump sum to the municipality. Among the early residents of Free Acres were the actor James Cagney and his wife, Billie.

Residents of Free Acres pay tax to their association, which maintains its streets and swimming pool, approves architectural changes to homes and pays a lump sum in taxes to the municipality.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 6.26 square miles (16.21 km2), including 6.22 square miles (16.11 km2) of land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) of water (0.59%). Certain portions of Berkeley Heights are located in various flood zones.

The township is located partially on the crest of the Second Watchung Mountain and in the Passaic River Valley, aptly named as the Passaic River forms the township&#x27;s northern border. The township is also located partially in the Raritan Valley region, in which the Green Brook (a tributary of the Raritan River) forms the township&#x27;s eastern border near the Watchung Reservation. Berkeley Heights is located in northwestern Union County, at the confluence of Union, Morris, and Somerset Counties. Berkeley Heights is bordered by New Providence, Mountainside and Summit to the east, Scotch Plains to the southeast, Chatham to the north, Watchung to the south, and Warren Township and Long Hill Township to the west.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Benders Corners, Glenside Park, Stony Hill and Union Village.

===Downtown===
Downtown Berkeley Heights is located along Springfield Avenue, approximately between the intersections with Plainfield Avenue and Snyder Avenue. Downtown is home to more than 20 restaurants which join with the Downtown Beautification Committee to hold an annual Restaurant Week each September.

<text>Clark is a township in southern Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 15,544, an increase of 788 (+5.3%) from the 2010 census count of 14,756, which in turn reflected an increase of 159 (+1.1%) from the 14,597 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==

The territory that would become Clark was originally a part of several early settlements. The Robinson Plantation House and The Squire Hartshorne House, buildings from the late 17th century, are remnants of the era. The Homestead Farm at Oak Ridge was the site of a skirmish preceding the Battle of Short Hills. In 1858, after the City of Rahway was incorporated, the area of present-day Clark was designated as the 5th Ward of Rahway. Clark was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1864, from portions of Rahway. The township was named for Abraham Clark, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Portions of the township were taken to form Cranford Township (March 14, 1871) and Winfield Township (August 6, 1941).

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Clark as its 33rd best place to live in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey. In 2013, &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Clark 174th in its rankings of &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

In July 2020, the Union County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office opened an investigation into the Clark township police department and put the police chief and a captain on administrative leave after allegations of misconduct.

In March 2022, NJ Advance Media, a local newspaper, revealed a recording of Mayor Sal Bonaccorso using racial slurs when talking to members of the police department, despite him having previously denied doing so, and also saying women police officers were &quot;disasters&quot;. The newspaper also reported that in January 2020, Clark Township had paid Clark police lieutenant Antonio Manata $400,000 to not reveal racist and sexist comments made by the Mayor and Chief of Police and to turn over the tapes he had recorded. On April 5, Bonaccorso admitted to using &quot;hurtful and insensitive language&quot; and apologized. The New Jersey Office of Public Integrity and Accountability subsequently took control of the Union County investigation.

<text>Elizabeth is a city in and the county seat of Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city retained its ranking as the state&#x27;s fourth-most-populous city behind neighboring Newark, Jersey City, and Paterson, with a population of 137,298, an increase of 12,329 (+9.9%) from the 2010 census count of 124,969, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,401 (3.7%) from the 120,568 counted in the 2000 census.

The Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 135,829 for 2023, making it the 207th-most populous city in the nation and the fifth-most populous municipality of any type in the state, falling behind Lakewood Township, where the population that year was estimated to be 139,866.

==History==
Elizabeth, originally called &quot;Elizabethtown&quot; and part of the Elizabethtown Tract, was founded in 1664 by English settlers. The town was not named for Queen Elizabeth I as many people may assume, but rather for Elizabeth, wife of Sir George Carteret, one of the two original Proprietors of the colony of New Jersey. She was the daughter of Philippe de Carteret II, 3rd Seigneur de Sark and Anne Dowse. The town served as the first capital of New Jersey.

During the American Revolutionary War, Elizabethtown was continually attacked by British forces based on Manhattan and Staten Island, culminating in the Battle of Springfield which decisively defeated British attempts to gain New Jersey. After independence, it was from Elizabethtown that George Washington embarked by boat to Manhattan for his 1789 inauguration. There are numerous memorials and monuments of the American Revolution in Elizabeth.

On March 13, 1855, the City of Elizabeth was created by an act of the New Jersey Legislature, combining and replacing both Elizabeth Borough (which dated back to 1740) and Elizabeth Township (which had been formed in 1693), subject to the results of a referendum held on March 27, 1855. On March 19, 1857, the city became part of the newly created Union County. Portions of the city were taken to form Linden Township on March 4, 1861.

The first major industry, the Singer Sewing Machine Company came to Elizabeth and employed as many as 2,000 people. In 1895, it saw one of the first car companies, when Electric Carriage and Wagon Company was founded to manufacture the Electrobat, joined soon by another electric car builder, Andrew L. Riker. The Electric Boat Company got its start building submarines for the United States Navy in Elizabeth, beginning with the launch of USS &quot;Holland&quot; (SS-1) in 1897. These pioneering naval craft (known as A-Class) were developed at Lewis Nixon&#x27;s Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth between the years 1896–1903. Elizabeth grew in parallel to its sister city of Newark for many years, but has been more successful in retaining a middle-class presence and was mostly spared riots in the 1960s.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 13.66 square miles (35.37 km2), including 12.32 square miles (31.91 km2) of land and 1.34 square miles (3.46 km2) of water (9.78%).

Elizabeth is bordered to the southwest by Linden, to the west by Roselle and Roselle Park, to the northwest by Union and Hillside, to the north by Newark (in Essex County). To the east the city is across Newark Bay from Bayonne in Hudson County and the Arthur Kill from Staten Island, New York.

The borders of Elizabeth, Bayonne, and Staten Island meet at one point on Shooters Island, of which of the island is owned by Elizabeth, though the island is managed by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.

The Elizabeth River is a waterway that courses through the city for and is largely channelized, before draining into the Arthur Kill.

==Districts and neighborhoods==

===Midtown / Uptown===
Midtown, also occasionally known as Uptown, is the main commercial district and a historic section as well. It includes the First Presbyterian Church and St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, and its St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Churchyard. The First Presbyterian Church was a battleground for the American Revolution. Located here are also the 1931 Art Deco Hersch Tower, the Thomas Jefferson Arts Academy, and the Ritz Theatre which has been operating since 1926. Midtown/Uptown includes the area once known as &quot;Brittanville&quot; which contained many English type gardens.

===Bayway===
Bayway is located in the southern part of the city and borders the City of Linden. From US 1&amp;9 and Allen Street, between the Elizabeth River and the Arthur Kill, it has maintained a strong Polish community for years. Developed at the turn of the 20th century, many of the area residents once worked at the refinery which straddles both Elizabeth and Linden. There are unique ethnic restaurants, bars, and stores along Bayway, and a variety of houses of worship. Housing styles are older and well maintained. There are many affordable two to four-family housing units, and multiple apartment complexes. The western terminus of the Goethals Bridge, which spans the Arthur Kill to Staten Island can be found here. A small section of the neighborhood was isolated with both the completion of the Goethals Bridge in 1928 and the construction of the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1950s.

===Downtown / Elizabethport===
Downtown / E-Port (a.k.a. The Port and Elizabethport) is the oldest neighborhood in Elizabeth. It consists of a collection of old world Elizabethan, new American colonial-style houses and apartment buildings that stretch east of 7th Street to its shores. The name is derived from its dependence on businesses catering to seagoing ventures. It was a thriving center of commerce between the 1660s through the middle of the 20th century. This area has had a great deal of improvement since 2000. Many homes have been renovated or been replaced with new, more ornate structures. Federal housing projects that stood for decades along First Street have been demolished and replaced with low to moderate income housing. The waterfront is home to new town homes and two-family homes (duplexes).

The area was once three distinct neighborhoods: Buckeye, Diamondville, and New Mexico. It was the US home of the Singer Manufacturing Company, makers of Singer sewing machines, which constructed a facility on a site in 1873. Shortly after it opened, the factory manufactured the majority of all sewing machines worldwide. With 6,000 employees working there in the 1870s, it employed the largest number of workers at a single facility in 1873. The company moved out of Elizabeth in 1982.

Elizabeth Marina, which was once filled with trash and debris along its walkway, was also restored. It is the site of year-round celebrations from a Hispanic festival in late spring to the lighting of a Christmas tree in winter. Living conditions in this area continue to improve year after year. Historically, there were immigrant communities centered around Christian churches. The Slavic community was centered by Sts. Peter and Paul Byzantine, the Lithuanian community attended Sts. Peter and Paul Roman Catholic and the Polish community attended St. Adalbert Roman Catholic Church which still stands. St. Patrick Church, originally Irish, dominates the &#x27;Port; the cornerstone for the second and current building was laid in 1887.

===Elmora and The West End===

Elmora is a middle/working-class neighborhood in the western part of Elizabeth. The main thoroughfare, Elmora Avenue, offers restaurants, shops and boutiques. Several high-rise building complexes, affording views of the New York City skyline, dot the edge of this neighborhood and are accessible to the Elizabeth station. The neighborhood area forms a &quot;V&quot; from its approximate borders of the Central Railroad tracks to Rahway Avenue.
====Elmora&#x27;s modern Orthodox community====
The Elmora section of Elizabeth is home to a large Modern Orthodox community. The Jewish Educational Center of Elizabeth was founded in 1941 by a Latvian-born rabbi, Pinchas Mordechai Teitz, who arrived to lecture in to the city&#x27;s then-small Orthodox community in the 1930s.

===Elmora Hills===
The northwestern part of Elmora is known as Elmora Hills. It is a strongly middle- to upper-middle-class neighborhood. Originally called Shearerville, the name Elmora came from the developers of the area, the El Mora Land Company. This area was annexed from Union Township, returning to Elizabeth in the early part of the 20th century. This was done to increase the city&#x27;s tax base as major improvements to infrastructure were necessary at the time.

===Frog Hollow===
Frog Hollow is a small community of homes east of Atlantic Street, west of the Arthur Kill, and south of Elizabeth Avenue. Its name is derived from the frogs that could be caught in its marshes as well as the oyster and fishing of the past. The area expanded east and includes the area formerly known as Helltown. Helltown included many of the docks and shipyards, as well as several drydocks. The area&#x27;s developer was Edward N. Kellogg, who also laid out the neighborhood in Keighry Head. Frog Hollow contains older-style, more affordable homes, rentals, and some quality restaurants in a working-class community. The statue honoring former Mayor Mack on Elizabeth Avenue is a landmark in the community. Frog Hollow is also convenient to the Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Waterfront Park.

===Keighry Head===
Its name is attributed to James Keighry of the Isle of Kerry, Ireland. He owned a business facing the square formed at the junction of Jackson, Madison, Chestnut and Magnolia Avenues. The approximate borders of this neighborhood extended north from East Grand Street to Flora Street and from Walnut to Division Street. Developed by Edward N. Kellogg, many of the streets were named after family and friends. Keighry Head is located close to Midtown, containing affordable one and two-family homes, and apartment houses, convenient to the Midtown shopping district, and transportation. 
===North End / North Elizabeth===
The North End, also known as &quot;North Elizabeth&quot;, is a diverse working-class neighborhood. The borders are approximately the Arch north to the city line between North Broad Street and US 1&amp;9. It was developed mostly in the 1920s for workers in the Duesenberg automobile plant (later Durant Auto, Burry Biscuits and Interbake Foods). The area was heavily settled by the Irish and then Portuguese. The North End has easy access to New York City and Newark via its own NJ Transit train station, Routes 1 and 9 and the New Jersey Turnpike. The neighborhood also has Crane Square, the Historic Nugents Tavern, and Kellogg Park, and is within close proximity to Newark Liberty International Airport. There is a current plan to develop the former Interbake Foods facility into shopping and residential townhouses and condominiums. This community contains many larger one and two-family homes that have been rebuilt over the past decade. North Elizabeth also features many well-kept apartment houses and condominium units on and around North Avenue that are home to professionals who work in New York or the area. The only Benedictine women&#x27;s community in New Jersey is located at Saint Walburga Monastery on North Broad Street.

===Peterstown===

Peterstown (also known as &quot;The Burg&quot;) is a middle/working-class neighborhood in the southeastern part of the city. Its borders run west of Atlantic Street to South Spring Street from 1st Avenue to the Elizabeth River. Its name is derived from John Peters, who owned most of the land with George Peters. They divided the land and developed it during the end of the 19th century. The area was once predominantly occupied by its earliest settlers, who were German, and during the 1920s was gentrified by newly immigrated Italians. Peterstown has clean, quiet streets and has many affordable housing opportunities with a &quot;village&quot; feel. The area contains the historic Union Square, which is home to produce stands, meat markets, fresh fish and poultry stores. Peterstown is also home of the DeCavalcante crime family, one of the most infamous Mafia families in the United States.

===The Point / the Crossroads===
The Point, formally known as the Crossroads, is centrally located and defined by New Point Road and Division Street. It is close to Midtown and contains many new affordable two-family homes, apartment houses and is undergoing a transformation. The former Elizabeth General Hospital site is currently being demolished and awaiting a new development.

===Quality Hill===
Home to St. Mary&#x27;s and the &quot;Hilltoppers&quot;, this area once was lined with mansions. Its approximate borders were South Broad Street to Grier Avenue and Pearl Street to what is now US 1&amp;9. During its development in the 1860s it was the most fashionable area of the city to live. It is now a quiet middle class community experiencing a re-development with many new condominiums.

===Westminster===

Groundbreaking was scheduled for the summer of 2008 on the ferry, roads and parking, and construction was planned to continue for at least twelve years. As of 2021 this project has not started construction and there is no recent news about Celadon, so it is assumed that this project has been canceled

==Education==

The city&#x27;s public schools are operated by Elizabeth Public Schools, serving students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in &quot;Abbott v. Burke&quot; which are now referred to as &quot;SDA Districts&quot; based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. Administration and operation of the district is overseen by a nine-member board of education. The board appoints a superintendent to oversee the district&#x27;s day-to-day operations and a business administrator to supervise the business functions of the district.

As of the 2018–19 school year, the district, comprised of 36 schools, had an enrollment of 28,712 students and 2,173.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.2:1. High schools in the district (with 2018–19 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Elizabeth High School Frank J. Cicarell Aacdemy (1,152; 9–12), 
J. Christian Bollwage Finance Academy (420; 9–12), 
John E. Dwyer Technology Academy (1,340; 9–12), 
Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Academy (872; 9–12), 
Admiral William F. Halsey Jr. Health and Public Safety Academy (1,111; 9–12), 
Alexander Hamilton Preparatory Academy (1,014; 9–12) and 
Thomas Jefferson Arts Academy (1,122; 9–12).

With 5,300 students, Elizabeth High School had been the largest high school in the state of New Jersey and one of the largest in the United States, and underwent a split that created five new academies and a smaller Elizabeth High School under a transformation program that began in the 2009–2010 school year. The school was the 294th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 322 schools statewide, in &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 2010 cover story on the state&#x27;s &quot;Top Public High Schools&quot;, after being ranked 302nd in 2008 out of 316 schools. Before the 2008–2009 school year, all of the district&#x27;s schools (except high schools) became K–8 schools, replacing the middle schools and elementary schools. SchoolDigger.com ranked Elizabeth 449th of 558 districts evaluated in New Jersey.

Halloran Alternative School #22 earned a second award when it was one of 11 in the state to be recognized in 2014 by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program. Terence C. Reilly School No. 7 was honored by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program in 2019, one of nine schools in the state recognized as Exemplary High Performing Schools; the school had previously won the honor in 2013.

Elizabeth is also home to several private schools. The coeducational St. Mary of the Assumption High School, which was established 1930, and the all-girls Benedictine Academy, which is run by the Benedictine Sisters of Saint Walburga Monastery, both operate under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark. The Newark Archdiocese also operates the K–8 schools Our Lady of Guadalupe Academy and St. Genevieve School, which was founded in 1926.

Saint Patrick High School was closed by the Newark Archdiocese in June 2012 due to increasing costs and declining enrollment. Administrators and parents affiliated with the defunct school came together to open an independent non-denominational school on Morris Avenue called &quot;The Patrick School&quot; in September 2012.

The Benedictine Preschool, operated by the Benedictine Sisters, is housed at Saint Walburga Monastery.

The Jewish Educational Center comprises the Yeshiva of Elizabeth (nursery through sixth grades), the Rav Teitz Mesivta Academy (for boys in grades 6–12) and Bruriah High School (for girls in grades 7–12).

<text>Fanwood is a borough in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located on a ridge in northern-central New Jersey, the borough is a commuter town of New York City in the New York metropolitan area. Fanwood is located in the Raritan Valley and Rahway Valley regions. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,774, an increase of 456 (+6.2%) from the 2010 census count of 7,318, which in turn reflected an increase of 144 (+2.0%) from the 7,174 counted in the 2000 census.

Fanwood was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on October 2, 1895, from portions of Fanwood Township (now known as Scotch Plains), based on the results of a referendum held the previous day. The borough was named for Fannie Wood, an author.

==History==
In 1831, the Elizabethtown and Somerville Railroad received a legislative charter to construct a railroad through the area. The line reached here in 1837 and a station, known as the Scotch Plains station, was built in 1839. The company became the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1849. The line was later moved to reduce the grade and a new station, known as the Fanwood station, was built in 1874. At the same time, the Central New Jersey Land Improvement Company began development of Fanwood Park, a residential community around the station. The development featured curvilinear streets. John Taylor Johnston, then president of CNJ, named the community after his wife, Frances, also known as Fanny, according to his daughter, Emily. In 1878, Fanwood Township was created from Plainfield and Westfield Townships.

==Historic district==

The Fanwood Park Historic District is a historic district located along North Avenue and North Martine Avenue in the community. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 27, 2004, for its significance in architecture, community planning and development, landscape architecture, and transportation. The district has 57 contributing buildings, including the Fanwood station, which was previously listed individually on the NRHP. A key contributing property, the Georgian Revival style Urner/Gibbs house was built in 1894 by Benjamin Urner, as a wedding gift for his daughter who had married William M. Gibbs.

==Transportation==

===Roads and highways===

, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Union County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

Route 28 (known in Fanwood as South Avenue) passes through the borough, connecting Plainfield and Scotch Plains.

Another major thoroughfare is South and North Martine Avenue, which connects Fanwood to U.S. Route 22 .

===Public transportation===

The Fanwood station is an NJ Transit railroad station on the Raritan Valley Line. The building on the north side of the tracks (westbound platform) is a Victorian building and, like the north building at Westfield station, is used by a non-profit organization. The ticket office is in the station building on the south side of the tracks (eastbound platform). The station provides service to Newark Penn Station, and from there to Hoboken Terminal or Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan.

Currently riders can take one seat rides to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan during rush hour on weekdays, with transfer at Newark Penn Station required to reach to New York Penn Station at all other times, including weekends. The Raritan Valley Railroad Coalition has been promoting the economic benefits of one-seat ride access to New York City since 1998. RVRC has succeeded in gaining one-seat rides during off peak hours during the week; there are nine trains in each direction where riders do not need to transfer at Newark Penn Station. The ultimate goal of RVRC is to extend such one-seat rides during rush hours, which would have been achieved with the Access to the Region&#x27;s Core tunnel program, but this was cancelled by then Governor Chris Christie.

NJ Transit offers bus service to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on the 113 and local service on the 822 route.

Newark Liberty International Airport is approximately 25 minutes away to the east.

<text>Hillside is a township in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 22,456, an increase of 1,052 (+4.9%) from the 2010 census count of 21,404, which in turn reflected a decline of 343 (−1.6%) from the 21,747 counted in the 2000 census.

Hillside was incorporated as a township on April 3, 1913, from portions of Union Township, based on the results of a referendum held on April 29, 1913. The township was named for the surrounding hills.

The township is split between area codes 908 and 973.

==History==
Hillside was created from parcels of land carved out of neighboring Newark, Elizabeth, and Union. It originally contained the farms of Woodruff, Conant and Saybrook. Local streets still bear their names.

Hillside was incorporated shortly after the appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet in 1910, and for that reason, the team nickname of Hillside High School was made the &quot;Comets&quot; when the high school opened in 1940. Several local businesses take the name &quot;Comet&quot; for the same reason.

The Hillside Historical Society was established in the 1980s in the Woodruff home on Conant Street, perhaps the township&#x27;s oldest. The Woodruff House and Eaton Store Museum is operated and maintained by the Hillside Historical Society. Purchased by the society in 1978, the house has been faithfully restored to its original grandeur. The Woodruff House spans three centuries in one structure, including the original 1735 building, the 1790 addition, the 1890s kitchen and the 1900s store. The society has also added to the grounds an authentic post and beam barn, a Phil Rizzuto and All Sports Museum honoring the Hillside legend as well as an archive to house the many documents the society has obtained over the years.

Jean-Ray Turner, a reporter for the &quot;Elizabeth Daily Journal&quot;, wrote &quot;Along the Upper Road&quot; in the 1970s, a book of the history of Hillside.

Hillside has been the home of Bristol-Myers Squibb. Lionel Trains were manufactured from 1929 to 1974 at a factory located in Hillside that employed as many as 2,000 employees. The town thrived for decades and reached an economic peak in the 1960s. Blue collar workers who lived primarily in the central part of town were employed in local manufacturing concerns. White collar workers established the neighborhood known as Westminster where Yankee shortstop and broadcaster Phil Rizzuto lived for most of his adult life, until his death. That section of town also included the private Pingry School for boys (which left the township) and is now the East Campus of Kean University.

In the 1950s and 1960s the township was approximately one-half Jewish, many of whom lived either in Westminster or in the area of Hillside near Chancellor Avenue, adjacent to the Weequahic section of Newark, which was the early home of comedian Jerry Lewis and writer Philip Roth (&quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot;).

In the early 1950s the township established Conant Park, its largest. The park is bounded by the Elizabeth River and Conant Street. At the rear area of the park near Pingry School was the boundary of the Kean Estate, the boyhood home of Governor Thomas Kean (1982–1990). The wealthy Kean family also donated the land on Morris Avenue and helped to establish Newark Normal College in 1885, which was renamed Kean College, and later Kean University, in the family&#x27;s honor. Also in the 1950s the Town Hall, Police Headquarters and Municipal Library were constructed at the corner of Liberty and Hillside Avenues.

Township organizations include Rotary International, Kiwanis, Knights of Columbus, Elks, the Hillside Industrial Association, the Hillside Business and Professional Women&#x27;s Club, the Republican Club and the Democratic Club, as well as a number of ethnic clubs and associations.

In 1991, police from both Hillside and Newark fired nearly 40 shots at a van that had rammed a Hillside police vehicle after a high-speed chase. The pursuit had started after the van had been reported stolen at gunpoint in Newark and was being followed by three Newark police cars before crossing into Hillside. Two of the people inside the vehicle were killed and four of the five other passengers were wounded, though the Union County Prosecutor indicated that there was no clear explanation for why the police had started shooting. The Reverend Al Sharpton held a rally outside Town Hall on Hillside Avenue demanding that the police officers involved in the shootings should be prosecuted for their actions.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Lyons Farms and Saybrooke.

The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the seven-member Township Council, all elected to four-year terms of office on a non-partisan basis as part of the November general election in odd-numbered years. Four council members come from wards, and three are elected at-large. The four ward seats all come up for election together and the mayoral and at-large seats come up for vote together two years later. In August 2010, the council voted to shift municipal elections from May to November, to be held in conjunction with the general election.

<text>Kenilworth is a borough in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,427, an increase of 513 (+6.5%) from the 2010 census count of 7,914, which in turn reflected an increase of 239 (+3.1%) from the 7,675 counted in the 2000 census.

Kenilworth was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 13, 1907, from portions of Cranford and Union Township, based on the results of a referendum held on June 18, 1907.

==History==

In the late 1890s, the New Orange Industrial Association purchased land in Cranford and Union that was subdivided into building lots. The firm brought in several large industries and lured Upsala College from Brooklyn with an offer of cash and free land for its campus.

Because New Orange was often confused with one of The Oranges in Essex County, the name &quot;Kenilworth&quot; was chosen when the borough was incorporated in 1907. The name Kenilworth came from a literary society (The Kenilworth Club) which the businessmen belonged to. The Kenilworth Club was named in honor of the novel &quot;Kenilworth&quot; written in 1821 by Sir Walter Scott. The novel refers to England&#x27;s Kenilworth Castle located in Kenilworth, England.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.15 square miles (5.57 km2), including 2.15 square miles (5.56 km2) of land and &lt;0.01 square miles (0.01 km2) of water (0.19%).

The upper reaches of Rahway River Parkway along tributaries of the Rahway River run through the borough.

The borough is bordered to the north and east by Union Township, to the southeast by Roselle Park, to the southwest by Cranford, and to the northwest by Springfield Township.

==Parks and recreation==
Lenape Park is a wildlife reserve and park that is part of the Rahway River Parkway in Union County. The park also includes portions of Cranford, Springfield and Westfield. An approximately 4.5-mile off-road paved pedestrian path stretches eastbound from Mountainside Police Headquarters in Mountainside, through Echo Lake Park in Westfield, Lenape Park in Westfield and Cranford, Black Brook Park in Kenilworth, and ending near 505 North Michigan Avenue in Kenilworth.

===Kenilworth RVRR rail trail===
 
Area residents have proposed a 7.3-mile pedestrian linear park along the &quot;main line&quot; of the abandoned Rahway Valley Railroad that would run through Kenilworth. The rail trail would run eastbound from Overlook Medical Center on the edge of downtown Summit and head south through Springfield, Union, over Route 22 to Kenilworth. In Kenilworth, it would pass between Party City and Burger King on Route 22, run behind Retro Fitness, running south past the Galloping Hill Golf Course, and end at the southwest edge of Roselle Park at the Cranford border.

A northern portion of the rail trail on the RVRR main line is under construction as the Summit Park Line, with a footbridge over Morris Avenue installed in October 2022. In parallel, advocates have been pushing for immediate development of the portion of the RVRR Main Line south of Route 22, running past the Galloping Hill Golf Course through Kenilworth and Roselle Park. The New Jersey Department of Transportation, which owns the railbed, has been working to clear it in anticipation of possible future trail use for pedestrians and cyclists.

The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Kenilworth is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

In January 2016, the borough council appointed former councilmember Lawrence Clementi to fill the seat expiring in December 2017 that had been held by Anthony DeLuca, until he resigned from the council to take office as mayor; Clementi will serve on an interim basis until the November 2016 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.

In July 2015, the borough council selected Scott Pentz from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by Barbara Macecsko, until she resigned from office the previous month. Pentz served on an interim basis until the November 2015 general election, when he lost to Democrat Kay Anne Ceceri, who was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

Mayor Kathi Fiamingo resigned her position in April 2014 after being selected to serve as a tax court judge. Council President Scott Klinder was chosen by the borough council to fill Fiamingo&#x27;s vacant mayoral seat and serve in that role until the November 2014 general election, when a successor would be chosen. Kevin Leary was then chosen to fill Klinder&#x27;s vacant council seat. In the November 2014 general election, Republican Fred M. Pugliese won the special election for the remaining term through December 2015 of the mayoral seat, while Democrats Anthony DeLuca and Nicholas Mascaro won both of the council seats up for election for terms starting January 1, 2015.
