Port Hope Schools, which had been in operation since 1925, closed its doors in the spring of 2015.

==History==
In 1851, William Stafford, while living in Lexington, bought the first parcel of land in what is now Port Hope, with Reuben Dimond. Later, Stafford and William Southard invested in buying up forty-acre parcels from the government. These parcels had been set aside as pensions for veterans of the War of 1812.
Traveling to the area by schooner, Southard was let off at some distance from shore, due to a pending storm. Rowing in a skiff in the wind, he vowed that if he made it to shore, he would name the spot Port Hope.

Stafford, along with others, opened up the area to lumbering and by 1858 his company dock was constructed and mills were in operation. The chimney from one of those mills can be seen and is the last standing chimney in Michigan from the lumbering era.

Port Hope survived the 1871 fire and was able to return to lumbering, but after the second fire in 1881 the trees were gone, and farming became the focus. Stafford adjusted and built a flour mill, elevator and a new dock.

Port Hope was incorporated in 1887, with the railroad coming in 1903. A walking tour brochure, with some of the 11 historic sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is available for visitors.

==Recreation==
Stafford County Park is the site of softball tournaments and recreation activities throughout the summer, the 38 acre park also offers all the campground conveniences. A national historic site, the Sawmill chimney erected in 1858 graces the waterfront adjacent to a large enclosed pavilion. Features 73 sites and six camper cabins on 38 acres. Modern, tent and group camping. Features electricity, running water, and flush toilets. Showers and a sanitary station, boat launch, picnic grounds, shelters, swimming, playground and fishing.

<doc id="117646" wikidata="Q777208" url="?curid=117646" title="Sebewaing, Michigan">
<text>Sebewaing (SEE-bah-wing) is a village in Huron County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,721 at the 2020 census. The village is within Sebewaing Township. This community is known as the Sugar Beet Capital, due to the Michigan Sugar slicing mill located within the village and the yearly Michigan Sugar Festival. The Sebewaing area, the Thumb, and the state of Michigan overall are major beet sugar producers, mostly for domestic consumption. Sebewaing is also the first gigabit village in the state of Michigan. In 2014–15, Sebewaing completed its fiber to the home network, offering up to gigabit/second speeds over their fiber optic network.

==Geography==
*According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water. It is said that the name Sebewaing derives from the Ojibwe word &quot;ziibiiweng&quot; meaning &quot;place by the river,&quot; but there is no clear, early, documentation for this word or meaning. Perhaps, the name Sebewaing meant &quot;river in the furriery or pelt country.&quot; That will come from the Chippewa or Ojibwe phrase &quot;Zibii-wayaan-aki.&quot; The 18th century French called the Thumb of Michigan les Pays Peles meaning the land of pelts or furs, the pelt country. The Cass River to the south of Saginaw Bay in this same Upper Thumb region early on was called Onottoway-Sebewing. The Cass River with its headwaters in the upper Thumb of Michigan has its confluence or outlet into the Saginaw River that empties into the central part of Saginaw Bay. Wiscoggin Creek, whose outlet is into Saginaw Bay at today&#x27;s Village of Unionville, Tuscola County, in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Thumb, was in 1855 called Sebewaning River. Previously, a short distance away, the Sebewaing River, in today&#x27;s Huron County, was called by the French Le Rivier du Fil meaning &quot;the thread river.&quot; The mouth of the Thread River that today&#x27;s is the Sebewaing River in Huron County is the location of the Village of Sebewaing. Here, the Sebewaing River pours out north into Saginaw Bay. Being on the banks of the river and bay shoreline, the village was certainly a place to weave strings or threads to make nets, fishing lines, snares, bow strings, necklaces, and dreamcatchers. Native American&#x27;s often made string or thread from Willow trees that they planted along strategic rivers.
Sebewaing is considered to be part of the Thumb of Michigan, which in turn is a subregion of the Flint/Tri-Cities.

Sebewaing&#x27;s name was derived from the Algonquian language of Native Americans, the original inhabitants of the area. The village was founded in 1845 by Rev. John J.F. Auch, a Lutheran minister sent by the church to do missionary work in the Native American communities.

Beginning in the mid-19th century, the town was settled by many migrants of German ancestry. In 1880 the E.O. Braendle Brewery began operations. The brewing operation was forced to close during Prohibition, but in 1927 it was renamed, and the Sebewaing Brewing Company brewed many types of German-style beer in the town until 1965. The defunct Michigan Brewing company in Webberville, Michigan resurrected some of the brands, using authentic formulae and labels.

Directly west of Sand Beach township lies that of Sigel. It was organized some time prior to 1864 with Watson Robinson as the first supervisor on the records. He took up of land under the homestead act that same year. In the fire of &#x27;81 all of his buildings and crops were destroyed. He found himself the morning after the fire without a hat or shoes and practically destitute of clothing of any kind. With his accustomed energy and enterprise he began at once to rebuild and repair as far as possible the damage done by the fire.

The first settlers in this township were Fred Jurgess, Joseph Lakowski and Waterhouse Whitelam, who came in 1859. Samuel Williams was another pioneer in this section of the county. In the early lumbering days he had worked for Pack, Woods &amp; Co., at Harbor Beach and later at Port Crescent. He moved on to his farm in Sigel soon after the fire of &#x27;71 and by diligence and hard labor transformed this piece of land from the wilderness that it was in 1874 to the modern country home of the present day.

<text>Alaiedon Township ( ) is a civil township of Ingham County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 2,910.

==Communities==
*German was an area of the township originally settled by immigrants from Germany.
*The city of Lansing is to the northwest of the township and also controls a noncontiguous tract of land within the township along Interstate 96 under a conditional land transfer agreement. Much of the northern portion is considered to be part of the Greater Lansing urban area.
*The city of Mason is to the south and has annexed land that was formerly within the township.
*The unincorporated community of Holt in Delhi Charter Township is to the west and the unincorporated community of Okemos in Meridian Charter Township is to the north.
*Michigan State University owns land in the northwest corner of the township.

==History==
The land that was to become the township was surveyed by a Musgrove Evans in 1827. James Phillips became the first person to settle in the township in December 1836 at a location known as Alaiedon Center. It was also known as German Settlement because most of its early residents were Germans. In 1837 the first settlement, Jefferson City, was platted and founded at what is today the Hagadorn and Lamb intersection along Mud Creek. The township was formally organized in 1842, and was named by Henry Schoolcraft, who came up with a pseudo-Native American name he claimed meant &quot;hill land for excellent living.&quot; At the time of its organization, the township consisted of what is today Lansing, Meridian, Delhi and Alaiedon townships. The aforementioned townships would be spun off in 1842 to give the township the boundaries it has to this day.

The township&#x27;s settlement pattern changed considerably in 1847, the same year the state capital was moved to Lansing Township. It was found that the town was never formally platted, and thus did not legally exist, preventing the settlement&#x27;s residents from obtaining deeds to their properties. Subsequently, the town was abandoned and few traces remain of its existence today. In 1877, residents constructed a township hall on one-quarter of an acre of Ingham County&#x27;s &quot;poor farm&quot; that served as the township hall until 1959 when a new one was constructed at 2021 West Holt Road.

In 1998, 2008, and 2013, the township entered into PA 425 Agreements, which conditionally transferred hundreds of acres of territory in the north-central part of the township to the city of Lansing to retain and expand the headquarters of Jackson National Life Insurance.

==Geography==

<text>Dansville is a village in Ingham County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is centered along M-36 within Ingham Township about southeast of downtown Lansing. The population was 563 at the 2010 census.

==History==
As far as European settlement is concerned, the area that is now the village of Dansville was originally settled by Samuel Crossman in 1844, who, like many settlers at the time, had come from the state of New York in search of a new life. Samuel Crossman&#x27;s son, Daniel Crossman, officially platted the village in 1857, naming it after himself and the village&#x27;s first postmaster, Dr. Daniel T. Weston. The settlement was not actually incorporated as a village until 1867.

Dansville is one of the earliest settlements in Ingham County. Permanent home-seekers located there as early as 1836–40, and the first business establishment was a small store, with a general stock, opened by Samuel Crossman about 1847. The first hotel was the Union Hotel, built in 1856-7 by David D. Fox. A post office was established in the southern part of Ingham Township in 1846, and was first kept by John B. Lobdell. Later it was moved to Hayne’s Corners, one and one-half mile south of the present village, and Henry Densmore was postmaster. It finally came to Dansville, where Daniel T. Weston was the first postmaster in 1855. The original plat of the village was laid out May BG, 1857, by Samuel Crossman and Ephraim Hillaird. D. L. Crossman and Dakin and Otis made additions in 1866.

Today, Dansville is a small village with much of its economy based on agriculture. While the village is in proximity to the state capital and Michigan State University, it has seen little commercial development over its history. The small town&#x27;s economy is supported primarily by small business, agriculture research, and production.

<doc id="117660" wikidata="Q2478103" url="?curid=117660" title="Haslett, Michigan">
<text>Haslett is a census-designated place (CDP) in Ingham County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located mostly within Meridian Charter Township with a small portion extending east into Williamstown Township. The population was 19,220 at the 2010 census. Haslett contains its own school district, as well as its own post office with the 48840 ZIP Code.

==History==
Haslett is named after James and Sarah Haslett, a couple who founded the Nemoka Spiritualist Camp on the shore of Pine Lake (Original name for Lake Lansing). By the later 1800s, thousands of spiritualists descended on Haslett Park for summer meetings, readings, lectures, and seances. Mr. Haslett had hoped to establish his camp as the National Headquarters for the spiritualist movement. His untimely death in 1891 and the decline of the spiritualist movement caused his widow to sell the land to the Haslett Park Association in 1898. The new owners transformed the land into a summer recreational destination, and eventually, a figure-8 wooden roller coaster and other carnival rides were added, thus establishing what became known as Lake Lansing Amusement Park. With the railroad established, the Lansing Trolley line added rails so that people could travel from the state capital, Lansing, to the new recreation center. Holding to this tradition, Haslett is host to Lake Lansing Parks North and South as well as a portion of the Inter-Urban Pathway and numerous other small parks and recreation facilities.

The city of Haslet, Texas, is named after Haslett, Michigan (note that the Texas community is spelled with one &#x27;t&#x27;). The Texas town of Haslet received its name from a railroad worker who relocated to Texas from Michigan in the late 1800s.

==Geography==

Haslett is bordered to the north by Clinton County and Shiawassee County. Business Loop I-69 (East Saginaw Street) runs through the northwest part of Haslett, leading northeast to Interstate 69 in Clinton County and west into Lansing.

Haslett is most notable for being the home of Lake Lansing. The lake is in size and features two public parks, allowing access to beaches, fishing, and a boat launch. The Michigan State University Sailing Club and Lansing Sailing Club are located on Lake Lansing. From 1934 until 1974, an amusement park operated near the lake and featured a wooden roller coaster at the site that is now Lake Lansing Park South. In 2007, &quot;Business Week&quot; ranked Haslett 42nd on their list of &quot;Best Places to Raise Your Kids&quot;.

<doc id="117663" wikidata="Q6029779" url="?curid=117663" title="Lansing Charter Township, Michigan">
<text>Lansing Charter Township is a charter township of Ingham County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 8,143 at the 2020 census.

The township consists of six non-contiguous sections bordered mostly by the cities of East Lansing and Lansing. The CDP of Edgemont Park is located in the north end of the western section of the township.

==History==
The first white settler to purchase land in the township was Jacob F. Cooley in 1837. The township was organized in 1842 in the northwest corner of Ingham County and was named after Lansing, New York – the hometown of one of the township&#x27;s original settlers. The township experienced its first loss of land in 1859 when the unincorporated settlement of Lansing officially incorporated as a city out of seven square miles near the center of the township.

On April 1, 1963, township voters voted to become a charter township, which provides for streamlined administration, expanded taxing authority, and added protection from annexation.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (2.52%) is water.

==Description==
The cities of Lansing and East Lansing have incorporated much of the land that formerly constituted the township reducing the township from its original to its current in six disconnected land areas.

The western section of the township is the largest, and traditionally included many of the township&#x27;s industrial developments, including the large General Motors Lansing Craft Center and neighboring Lansing Metal Center automobile factories, both of which were closed in early 2006 and demolished in 2008. A Superfund site, the former site of Adams Plating, is also located in this part of the township. Also in the western part are the former Waverly Golf Course and the adjacent Michigan Avenue Park. The properties were sold for commercial and residential redevelopment in 2018. The CDP (census-designated place) of Edgemont Park is also located in this section of the township north of Saginaw Street (M-43) .

The northeastern section of the township is heavily industrialized west of Wood Road. However, since 2002, the area east of Wood Road has been developed as the &#x27;downtown&#x27; of the township with the construction of the Eastwood Towne Center, one of the largest shopping malls in Metropolitan Lansing. The township created the Lansing Township Downtown Development Authority (DDA) in May 2003 to capture local property taxes for infrastructure development of the district.

The eastern sections of the township are mostly residential neighborhoods, though commercial development lines Grand River Avenue, Michigan Avenue, Kalamazoo Street and both sides of US-127. The northern portions of these sections include parts of the Groesbeck neighborhood north Grand River Avenue and east of Wood Road. The southern portion includes part of the Urbandale neighborhood.

The southeastern section of the township is zoned exclusively for agricultural development, and contains research farms for Michigan State University, including the Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Center, Horse Teaching and Research Center, Entomology Field Research Lab, and Botany Field Research Lab. This section also contains one privately-owned farm along East Jolly Road.

<text>Mason is a city and the county seat of Ingham County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 8,252 at the 2010 census. Mason was named after Stevens T. Mason, the state&#x27;s first governor.

==History==
In 1836 Charles Noble knew that Michigan would be seeking a central location for a new capital when it became a state. He purchased an area of forest, cleared 20 acres (81,000 m2), and founded Mason Center. The &quot;Center&quot; was soon dropped. In 1847, however, the state chose Lansing Township 12 miles (19 km) northward to be its capital due to its potential for water power. Noble managed to make Mason the county seat instead. Ingham County&#x27;s first downtown courthouse was built in 1843, and was replaced in 1858, and the economy thrived in the first decades based on sawmills, carriage and cart factories, copper shops, a steam flourmill and a buffalo robe manufacturer. In 1865, Mason was incorporated as a village; in 1875 the town became a city. In the 1800s, Mason was the center of Ingham County activity, even more than was Lansing, the state capital. In 1877, Lansing attempted to take the status of county seat for itself, but the two cities made an agreement that moved some county offices and courts to Lansing in exchange for Mason remaining the county seat. As a result, Michigan is the only state in the country with a capital city that is not also a county seat.hen again in 1905.

<text>Meridian Charter Township is a charter township of Ingham County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township had a population of 43,916.

The township is named after the Michigan meridian, which comprises the eastern border of the township. The township contains the unincorporated communities of Haslett and Okemos. Bordering East Lansing to the west, Meridian Charter Township is the third-largest municipality within the Lansing–East Lansing metropolitan area.

==History==
Meridian Township was first settled by pioneers in 1836. In November 1836, Obed Marshall purchased of land near present-day Haslett. The earliest settlers located at Pine Lake (now Lake Lansing) and made use of the numerous stands of pines to build their cabin. The lake was later the site of a Spiritualist Meeting Camp led by John Haslett. During the late 19th century, the lake became known as a local vacation area served by an &quot;interurban trolley&quot; which ran from the City of Lansing to the resort on the south side of the lake. An amusement park was introduced and enjoyed immense popularity into the mid-20th century. Currently, the Village of Haslett is located at the south side of Lake Lansing.

The first settlers near the current Village of Okemos (to the south of the former Pine Lake) were Sanford Marsh and his wife who built their cabin in 1839. They were soon followed by Joseph Kilbourne, who took out land for his brother-in-law, Freeman Bray.

It was Bray who platted out the southeast corner of his land and sold the lots to newcomers traveling into the mid-state wilderness. The village was first known as Hamilton. 
A post-office called Sanford was established in the spring of 1840. Joseph H. Kilbourne was the first postmaster.
A local Native American, Chief John Okemos, was well known throughout the area. The village area was one of his primary camping areas and he traveled frequently between the village and another campsite near present-day Portland, Michigan. In 1857, the Michigan Legislature changed the name of the village officially to Okemos to honor the old chief.

The Township is rich with history and one resident, Joseph Kilbourne, had a major role in the decision in 1847 to relocate the state capitol from Detroit to Lansing (then Lansing Township). A local organization, the Friends of Historic Meridian, has an archive of local historic information and also maintains the historic buildings in the Meridian Historical Village.

==Geography==

<text>Williamston is a city in Ingham County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,854 at the 2010 census. Williamston is located east of the city of Lansing and borders Williamstown Township to the north and Wheatfield Township to the south. The Red Cedar River and M-43 run through the center of the city.

== History ==

The location that was later to become Williamston started as the crossroad of the Grand River and Saginaw Indian Trails. It was first occupied by a small band of the Saginaw tribe of the Chippewa People which by the mid-19th century used the area as a &#x27;summer village&#x27; (it was not used by them year-round, but they &#x27;wintered&#x27; in the area that is now Meridian Township). They used Williamston for planting crops, burying their dead, and holding an annual spring gathering, primarily using the land just north of the Red Cedar River.

The area was settled by Europeans in 1834 when Hiram and Joseph Putnam moved briefly to the area from Jackson. They spent less than one full year in the area, planting and then harvesting one crop of oats. Today, inside the city limits, Williamston Road becomes Putnam Street, having been named in their honor. (For many years, several street signs inside the city were misspelled as &quot;Putman Street&quot;, leading to confusion about the correct spelling.)

In 1839, the Putnams sold their land to Oswald B., James M., and Horace B. Williams, three brothers from Batavia, New York. James M. &quot;Miles&quot; Williams, who built a dam, sawmill and later a grist mill in town, eventually platted the land in 1845 and named the town &quot;Williamstown&quot; after himself. It is unknown how it lost the &quot;w&quot; in its name.

The town was a popular stop on the Grand River trail (that later became a plank road) from Detroit to Lansing in the 19th century. That trail is now Grand River Avenue (M-43) which runs through downtown Williamston. Because the primary means of transportation at that time was the horse and buggy and because the trip from Detroit to Lansing took more than one day, Williamston became a convenient overnight stop.

The town was incorporated as a village in 1871, and later as a city on April 1, 1945. A later revised City Charter was adopted by the people effective in April 1963. This charter has been amended several times but remains in effect today.

A history of the area was published for the City&#x27;s centennial celebration in 1971. It included many photographs and stories of the early city and its inhabitants. There were earlier histories, as well, published in 1880, the 1930s, and in 1963.

== Geography ==
Williamston is located 15 miles east of Lansing, the state capital city of Michigan, and 11 miles east of East Lansing, the home of Michigan State University. The city is located two miles north of I-96, which provides access to Lansing and Detroit.

== Economy ==
The modern economy is primarily that of a bedroom community. Many residents commute to local, larger towns such as Okemos, East Lansing, or Lansing, where most of the employment is located. The Williamston community was once very reliant on farming as an occupation, however, its prominence in the community has since declined. Although there is no longer much farmland within the city limits, the surrounding area is still devoted to farming.

Today, Williamston is well known to the mid-Michigan area for its antiques stores and specialty shops in the downtown area. Williamston is home to two golf courses, The Brookshire Restaurant and Golf Course and Wheatfield Valley Golf Course, as well as a live theatre called Williamston Theatre, and an old-style single screen movie theatre called The Sun Theatre. There is a Williamston branch of the Capital Area District Library, restaurants, a market, grocery store, the Sun Theatre, and numerous smaller clothing stores, boutiques, special interest shops and antique dealers. The Meridian Mall is located in nearby Okemos. The largest employer in the City is the Williamston Community Schools with 170 employees.

Habitat for Humanity has a restore and training facility for staff and volunteers.

An industrial park opened near I-96, the major corridor between Grand Rapids, Lansing and Detroit.

==Arts and culture==

A major event in town is the week-long festival known as the Red Cedar Jubilee. It typically begins the last week of June with a children&#x27;s &#x27;bike parade&#x27; through Williamston, and ends with the Boy Scout pancake breakfast on Sunday morning. Events of the Jubilee include a demolition derby, duck race, and chicken barbecue, as well as other events and games for children of all ages. The proceeds from some of the events go to benefit local community groups. One such group, the Lions Club, runs a food and beverage tent during the festival.

Artfest on the River, was held in July each year at McCormick Park. The festival however, folded after seven years. The festival was scheduled to return in 2011, but was canceled and instead slated to return in 2012. As of 2013 ArtFest on the River returned and features vendors, free activities for children, and live music.

The first Thursday and Friday of August brings the Dog Days of Summer to Williamston. This event encourages area dog owners to bring their pets for activities including a pet parade, ugly dog contest, agility demonstrations, and Williamston&#x27;s Deputy Dog contest. The Ingham County Animal Shelter conducts a pet adoption and fundraising drive during the festival.

The City of Williamston also sponsored a Labor Day &#x27;Bridge Walk&#x27; annually. The former Mayor, Kenneth Zichi, led a group on a brief walking tour of town, pointing out sites of historic interest, and including a &#x27;bridge crossing&#x27; of the Red Cedar River. Patterned after the &#x27;Mackinac Bridge Walk&#x27; led by Michigan&#x27;s governor, this was an opportunity to learn a bit more about the history and culture of a small town in Michigan, and enjoy the holiday.

On the first Saturday in December, the downtown hosts the annual Light Parade. Activities begin in the afternoon and culminate with a parade of lighted floats and vehicles through downtown Williamston. Afterward, children are given a chance to meet Santa Claus. Typically, stores and street booths sell hot drinks and musicians wander the street during the afternoon and evening. Occasionally, there is an ice sculpture or two spread throughout town.

In the Spring, Summer, and Fall, Williamston&#x27;s Downtown Development Authority, Economic Development Corporation and City Government sponsor a weekly Farmers&#x27; Market in the downtown.

==Government ==
Williamston is governed by a seven-member City Council, and an appointed city manager. The City Council is responsible for all legislative and policymaking in Williamston. Elections are held every two years for four spots on the Council.

The Mayor and Mayor Pro-Tem of Williamston are chosen by Council from among its members at the last meeting of each calendar year.

The city has a Downtown Development Authority, Economic Development Corporation, and a Planning Commission.

== Education ==
Public education in Williamston and the surrounding area is provided by Williamston Community Schools. The schools consist of K-2 (Discovery Elementary) and 3-5 (Explorer Elementary), 6-8 (Williamston Middle), and 9-12 (Williamston High School).

The private schools of St. Mary School and Memorial Lutheran are located in Williamston and nearby Williamstown Township, respectively.

===Belding Museum at the Belrockton===

The Belding Museum is located in the historic Belrockton at 108 Hanover Street. The Bel, as it is known by locals, is a designated Michigan Historical Site. Built in 1906, the Belrockton is the last remaining boarding house of the three provided by the Belding Brothers and Company for its single female workers. A major silk manufacturer during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the company employed hundreds of young women and earned Belding the title of &quot;Silk City of the World&quot;. Providing accommodations for one hundred residents and staff, the Belrockton Dormitory, a Classical Revival-inspired building, was erected at a cost of thirty thousand dollars. Following the closing of the company&#x27;s silk mills in 1935, the &quot;Bel&quot; served as a residential training center for the National Youth Administration. In 1943, the building became a recreation center. The city of Belding purchased the structure in 1950 to serve as a community center. In 1987 it became the home of the Belding Museum. The Belding Museum is still up and running, hosting numerous local events.

===Alvah N. Belding Memorial Library===

The Alvah N. Belding Memorial Library is located at 302 E. Main Street, Belding, Michigan.
Belding&#x27;s first public library was organized in 1890 by a group of civic-minded women who were members of the Ladies Literary Club. A meager collection of books, some from personal libraries and some purchased from funds raised through strawberry festivals, 25¢ suppers, and subscription drives, was housed in a room above a store on west Main Street. After the disastrous fire of 1893 swept Main Street, the burned out library was reinstalled in a room over Connell&#x27;s Drug Store and then later, in an upper room at City Hall. In 1914, upon a suggestion of local businessman Byron Brown, Alvah N. Belding of the Belding &amp; Bros. Company, Silk Manufacturers, decided to build and give a library to the City of Belding. On March 21, 1917, the Belding City Council accepted his offer and agreed to maintain the building in like beauty and form as a library for all time.

==Education==

<doc id="117690" wikidata="Q2106605" url="?curid=117690" title="Lake Odessa, Michigan">
<text>Lake Odessa is a village in Ionia County of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 2,018 at the 2010 census. It is located in the southern portion of the county in Odessa Township on the northeast shore of Jordan Lake, which is the boundary with Barry County.

Since 1987, Lake Odessa has been named a &quot;Tree City USA&quot; by the National Arbor Day Foundation.

==History==
Several brothers in the Russell family began settling here around 1839 and it became known as the &quot;Russell Settlement&quot;. It later became known as &quot;Bonanza&quot; and a Post Office with that name was established in 1880. When the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad (later the Pere Marquette Railroad) was built through the area in the 1880s, the village was moved about a mile southwest. At that time the name was changed to &quot;Lake Odessa&quot;, derived from the nearby Jordan Lake and the name of Odessa Township, which had been established in 1846. The township had been named for the city of Odesa in Ukraine, reflecting an interest of one of the founders in Ukraine as well as a desire for a distinctive name. Investor Humphrey Wager purchased of farmland on Jordan Lake and platted the village in 1887. With the advantage of a station on the new railroad, the new village quickly eclipsed the former settlement at Bonanza. The village incorporated in 1889. John R. Waite, a local man with an interest in history, has been credited with significant historical research for the village of Lake Odessa. John is also recognized as the President of the Lake Odessa Area Historical Society and is involved with the Train Depot Museum.

* Belding is an incorporated city situated within the northeast corner of the township.
* Cooks Corners is the location of an early settlement in the township at near the junction of M-44 and M-91 just west of Belding.
* Smyrna is an unincorporated community at , a few miles southwest of Belding near mouth of the Seely Creek on the Flat River.

== History ==
The township was organized on March 6, 1838 from survey townships 7 and 8 north in range 8 of the Michigan Survey. Township 7 was set off as Keene Township on February 16, 1842. The name was taken from Otisco, New York.

The first white settlement in the area was where Dickinson Creek flows into the Flat River northeast of Belding. George W. Dickinson, in company with Thomas Cornell, both of New York, built a saw mill there in 1836. The settlement became known as Dicksonsonville, though when a post office was opened in June 1838, it was named &quot;Otisco&quot;, after the township. Dickinson sold the mill to James M. Kidd in 1845, who platted the village as Kiddville and a post office reopened there with that name in February 1855. The Kiddville Post Office close in June 1894.

Cook&#x27;s Corners was an important early settlement. In 1829, Rufus R. Cook, had led to the area a group of men from New York looking for prospective land for purchase. He returned in 1837 with his family. The post office in Dicksonville was transferred to Cooks Corners in 1839, with Cook as the first postmaster. He built a tavern there in 1846, which proved to be a popular area attraction, and a general store in 1850. The tavern was later a stop on the stage line between Ionia and Greenville. Cook platted the village as Cooks Corners in May 1856.

A significant number of German immigrants settled in the southern portion of the township, centered on section 33. A Roman Catholic church was built in 1850 and was replaced by a larger structure in 1872.

Although Munson Seely had settled at what is now Smyrna soon after Dickson had arrived, he moved on to Muskegon County a few years later, though his name remains in Seely Creek. After Seely, the next settler there was Calvin Smith in 1843. Soon after, George Dickson, seeking to expand his business, purchased land in the area to build a gristmill at the mouth of the Seely Creek. Dr. Wilbur Fisher arrived in 1848 and arranged to establish a post office there. According to postal regulations, the community was too near to Cooks Corners to have a separate office, but on his application for the office, Fisher had given section 32 as the location, just far enough to qualify for an office (even though it was over a mile away from the community. Fisher chose the name &quot;Smyrna&quot; for the office, reportedly because he wanted to ensure a unique name. In September 1853, Dickson platted the village as Mount Vernon, after Mount Vernon, Virginia, the home of the first U.S. president, George Washington. The village was also called &quot;Mount Vernon Mills&quot;, but the post office was always Smyrna.

Roof, who said he was inspired by the lead character in a novel he was reading at the time. (This may have been Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;The Lord of the Isles&quot;, in which the protagonist is named Ronald.)

== Communities ==
* Palo is an unincorporated community in the northern part of the township at . It began on land owned by Matthew and John Van Vleck. The name &quot;Palo&quot; [pronounced Pay-Low, locally] was suggested by John in honor of the victory by General Zachary Taylor at the Battle of Palo Alto, the first major battle of the Mexican–American War fought on May 8, 1846. A post office was established on July 14, 1857, with Dr. Orla H. Taylor as the first postmaster. The community was first platted and recorded on March 12, 1867 by William H. Freeman. The Palo post office was discontinued on February 4, 1995, although the Palo ZIP code 48870 continues to provide P.O. Box only service through use of the local store Joe&#x27;s Market and a postal contract.

<text>Saranac is a village in Boston Twp, Ionia County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,325 at the 2010 census. Today, Saranac serves as a retail and services hub for agricultural areas surrounding the village.

==History==
Saranac had its roots in 1836, when a Grand Rapids judge by the name of Jefferson Morrison purchased the land where Lake Creek meets the Grand River. Soon after, he sold parts of the land to Dwight &amp; Hutchinson from Detroit, and together, they founded the village. Proceeding quickly, the proprietors named it Saranac and held a public sale in Detroit. There they sold off many Saranac lots without doing much to ensure the integrity of their original records.
Soon after, Dwight &amp; Hutchinson became concerned over the lack of development of the village by the lot-purchasers and gave Cyprian S. Hooker land on which to build a saw mill. Construction began in 1837, but didn&#x27;t see completion until 1841. Partnering with a furniture maker named Jerry Stocking, the two set out to make their fortunes in the new village. However, they did not find success, and in 1846, the gentlemen gave up and moved away. Other villagers followed suit, convinced the village was doomed. 
In 1847, a merchant named Ammon Wilson moved in and set up shop on Stocking&#x27;s former property and later built a warehouse to ship wheat to Grand Rapids, which saw considerable success. The village grew around it; a tavern and a hotel soon followed. 
In 1851, proprietors of the sold-off lots were allowed to re-dub the township &quot;Boston&quot;, due to an oversight in Dwight &amp; Hutchinson&#x27;s records and it wouldn&#x27;t be until 1859 that popular demand would see the name changed back to &quot;Saranac&quot;. Schools, stores, and churches, followed in the subsequent years.
In 1857, the first train to reach Saranac rolled through, marking a significant period of growth for the village. Lorren Denman &quot;L-Dog&quot; a noted kiln operator also was raised in Saranac.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The village is located along the Grand River Valley, within a deep glacial drainage channel and is intersected by the Grand River. The landscape itself is dominated by dense forest, and sprawling, open farmland. The forest is closely associated with the basin of the Grand River and its floodplains and wetlands. However, wetlands have dwindled over the years, due to drainage and filling in order to improve agricultural opportunities within the region. This is not atypical within the state of Michigan, despite the vast ecological importance that Michigan&#x27;s wetlands possess.

==Government==
Saranac is a general-law village with an elected council consisting of a president, clerk, treasurer, and six trustees.

<doc id="117705" wikidata="Q7442769" url="?curid=117705" title="Sebewa Township, Michigan">
<text>Sebewa Township is a civil township of Ionia County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2010 census, the township population was 1,171 and decreased to 1,124 at the 2020 census.

==Communities==
* Sebewa (or Sebewa Corners) is an unincorporated community at straddling the boundary between Sebewa Township on the west and Danby Township on the east. On April 11, 1867, Pierce G. Cook, as an agent for Elizabeth Cornell of New Jersey, platted the portion of community in Danby with the name Cornell. Other plats were made on the Sebewa side and over time, the name reverted to Sebewa for the entire settlement. 

==History==

=== Early settlers===
The first permanent white settlers in the township were John F. Terrill, Charles W. Ingalls, and John Brown from Vermont, who arrived in 1838. An earlier settler by the name of Jones had arrived in 1836 with his wife, but did not remain in the area. Terrill located on section 25 and Ingall and Brown in section 36. In 1843, Terrill, along with Anson W. Halbert, built a sawmill on the Sebewa Creek, just west of &quot;The Corners&quot; located where the corners of four sections met along the eastern township line. Halbert had arrived in 1841 and married one of Terrill&#x27;s daughters and carried out some trade at the Corners. 

Jacob Showerman had been to the area in 1836 looking for land and found only Jones in section 1. Showerman entered a claim for of land in section 22 and returned in 1839 with Eleazer Brown and their families. They lodged in the small one-room cabin of Terrill&#x27;s along with Terrill&#x27;s and that of William Hogle and his son-in-law John Brown. The twenty people in the four families passed four weeks together until a path to Showerman&#x27;s property could be cut. Eleazer Brown settled on land he bought in section 26.

Rufus Goddard, who had moved west from Livingston County, New York, came to the area in 1837 and located land in Sebewa while his family remained in Lenawee County. Goddard, along with Benjamin D. Weld, who was to give some assistance to Goddard, were to come together to Sebewa. However, Weld was not ready to move and both families remained in Lenawee. Weld moved to Sebewa in 1843 and settled in the southwestern part of Sebewa. Goddard followed in 1844 and worked a year and a half to repay Weld before settling on in section 32.

===Township organization===
Sebewa Township was a part of Berlin Township until March 19, 1845, when it was created as a separate township. The first names proposed were &quot;Charlestown&quot;, in honor of Charles W. Ingalls; and &quot;Liberia&quot;, but Rufus Goddard suggested Sebewa, after Sebewa Creek, meaning &quot;little river&quot;. The first township meeting was held at the home of Jacob Showerman, but no record of the meeting attendees or acts remains. 

===Post offices===
A post office named &quot;Sebewa&quot; was established on January 24, 1851, with Benjamin Weld as the first postmaster. On April 14, 1854, the post office was moved from Weld&#x27;s properties in the southwest part of the township to the Showerman settlement when Lucius Showerman was named postmaster. In 1857, the office moved to &quot;The Corners&quot;. The name was changed to &quot;Cornell&quot; on July 8, 1861, but was changed back to Sebewa on February 16, 1881. The office was closed on November 15, 1913.

<text>Au Sable Township is a charter township of Iosco County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 2,016 at the 2020 census.

==Communities==
*Au Sable is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within the township at .
*Oscoda is an unincorporated community and census-designated place that is mostly located within Oscoda Township to the north at . Only a very small portion of the CDP extends into Au Sable Township.

==History==

The area was originally inhabited by the Chippewa Native Americans, who used the area for hunting and fishing. They ceded the area to the federal government under the Treaty of Saginaw in 1819. The first European settler to claim land was French-Canadian fur trader Louis Chevalier, and he established a trading post slightly upstream along the Au Sable River, which was translated from the French language &quot;river of sand.&quot; The area became popular for hunters, fishermen, and trappers. In 1848, the township was established, and the community of Au Sable was platted in 1849 at the river mouth along Lake Huron. The township was later organized in 1857 under the name Sable when Iosco County was formally organized, and the township name was changed to AuSable in 1877.

The community of Au Sable became the center of population and incorporated as an autonomous city in 1889. The new city had a population of 4,828 at the 1890 census, while Au Sable Township remained sparsely populated and only had a population of 170. Along with neighboring Oscoda, the area became part of the thriving lumber region. After the lumber industry declined, the population dwindled, and Au Sable and Oscoda suffered a devastating fire in 1911. The city of Au Sable never recovered and surrendered its city charter in 1931 and returned to township control.

Due to its location along the Au Sable River and Lake Huron coastline, a lighthouse was established at the river mouth to aid ships that were used to transport the large lumber supplies. The Au Sable Pierhead Lighthouse was commissioned in 1873. The lighthouse survived the devastating 1911 fire, but the surrounding area was destroyed. A newer skeletal tower was constructed in 1912 and later automated in 1940. The tower was deactivated and removed in 1957. It then sat on the grounds of the Oscoda Yacht Club and fell into desrepair. It was eventually restored and erected near U.S. Route 23 at the Huron Shores Artisan Hall just to the north in Oscoda Township.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (2.32%) is water.

The Au Sable River runs through the northeast boundary and has its river mouth at Lake Huron within the township.

<text>Tawas City is a city in and county seat of Iosco County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,834 at the 2020 census. The city is mostly surrounded by Tawas Township, but the two areas are administered autonomously.

==History==

Tawas City was founded in 1854 as the first city to be located on the shores of Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron north of Bay City, Michigan. Tawas City was designated as the county seat of Iosco County, and the first post office was established Jan. 6, 1856, with James O. Whittemore appointed postmaster.

Since Tawas City&#x27;s founding, the community&#x27;s economy has been a major factor influencing land use and development patterns. The rich natural resource base of the area: forest lands, Lake Huron and wildlife, combined with the protection offered by Tawas Bay, inspired the founding of the city and provided resources to support a lumber industry. The shoreline, as the transition zone between land and water, became the focus of the community, with the city developing in a linear fashion along the bayshore. Tawas Bay continues to serve as a harbor of refuge, used by large freighters to escape severe storms on Lake Huron.

Statements that “Tawas” is derived from the word “Ottawas” and that the Ottawa Indians once inhabited this region are false. The local Indians had made camps along the shore of the bay and near the mouth of the river. They were a band from the Saginaw, Michigan tribe of Chippewa (also known as Ojibwa). Their leader was Chief O-ta-was. As he had his camp on the shores of the bay, it was known as O-ta-was&#x27;s Bay. Early map makers dropped in an extra “t&quot;; later map makers dropped off the “s.” The name of the point dividing the bay from Lake Huron was known as Ottawa Point. Comparatively recent spelling and pronunciation for the name of these Chippewa gradually evolved to &quot;Tawas&quot;.

The Whittemores named the community they founded as Tawas City. Eight years later, the lumbering firm of Smith, Van Valkenburg and Company built a mill on the bay shore a mile or so east of the Whittemore mill and holding. When a community developed around this latter mill, the cluster of homes was, by common consent, named East Tawas. For many years, residents of both towns and the surrounding farming community often referred to Tawas City as “old town” and to East Tawas as “east town.”

<text>Mount Pleasant is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. The city is the county seat of Isabella County, which is part of Central Michigan. The population of Mount Pleasant was 21,688 as of the 2020 census. The city is surrounded by Union Charter Township, but is politically independent.

Part of the city (with a population of 8,741) is located within the Isabella Indian Reservation, the base of the federally recognized Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation. The tribe&#x27;s Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort in nearby Chippewa Township is also within the reservation boundaries.

Mount Pleasant is home to the main campuses of Central Michigan University, one of the largest universities in the state with 20,000 students at Mount Pleasant, and Mid Michigan Community College. The student population nearly doubles the population of the city during the academic year, making it a college town. Despite its name, the surrounding area is mostly flat and does not feature any mountains or hills.

==History==

Until the mid-19th century, this area was occupied by historical bands of the Ojibwa people, known by English speakers as the Chippewa. In the early decades of the century, they ceded vast amounts of land to the United States government, which wanted to enable settlement by European Americans.

The federal Graduation Act of 1854 allowed settlers to purchase land from the government at discount rates, and the first white settlers began to arrive in what became Mount Pleasant. Under the Treaty of 1855, the Ojibwa bands (Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation) from the Saginaw, Swan Creek, and Black rivers were relocated to land in Isabella County (Isabella Indian Reservation).

Many non-natives soon moved to Mount Pleasant, predicting prosperous relations with the natives. The Homestead Act of 1862 also attracted many new settlers to Mount Pleasant, including new European immigrants, They worked to develop their stake on free lands offered by the US government in exchange for their labor in developing it for residence and agriculture.

The village and future city developed. In 1875, a devastating fire started at the Fancher Building on the north corner of Broadway and Main streets. It moved east down Broadway, destroying several buildings. Seven years later another fire would damage buildings on the south side of Broadway.

In 1879 the first library was established in Mt. Pleasant. Known as &quot;The Library, Literary, and Musical Association of Mount Pleasant,&quot; its first books were made up of the personal book collections of the board members.

In 1890, W.A. Jordan started Mount Pleasant Business College. Expanding in 1892, the school changed its name to Central Michigan Normal School and Business Institute, as it incorporated a curriculum of teacher training. It was the origin of what is now Central Michigan University. The Mt. Pleasant main campus is the largest of 8 CMU locations in the state, with just over 10,000 undergrad students living on campus or campus affiliated housing in the fall of 2022. 

On January 3, 1893, the U.S. government opened an Indian boarding school called the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School. Indian children were forced to give up their cultural ways and assimilate to using the English language and adopting European-American culture. The school operated for 40 years, closing in 1933.

Since the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the role of such schools has been re-evaluated and the damage done to children by such efforts has been acknowledged. Various Native American groups have taken action to help people reconcile their experiences. On July 17, 2009, the White Bison Wellbriety Journey for Forgiveness made a stop in the Mount Pleasant community to recognize this part of the city&#x27;s history. The boarding school building was abandoned, but the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation purchased it from the state of Michigan.

In 1928, large quantities of oil were discovered in the Mt. Pleasant area. A farm owned by the Lilly family was the first to strike, producing hundreds of barrels a day. Although oil resources eventually diminished, this legacy is represented in the Mt. Pleasant city seal, which includes an image of an oil drill. Mt. Pleasant High School&#x27;s mascot, the Oiler, also refers to the city&#x27;s history of oil production. The city eventually became known as the &quot;Oil Capital of Michigan&quot;.

==Geography==

<text>Union Charter Township is a charter township of Isabella County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 12,927 at the 2010 census, and decreased to 11,699 at the 2020 census. The city of Mount Pleasant is entirely surrounded by the township on incorporated land that was formerly part of the township, but the two are administratively separate.

==Communities==
*Mount Pleasant was a former community of Union Charter Township that has since been incorporated into a city and is now administered separately from the township. Though separate, it is the only remaining community in existence from within the township.

===Former Communities===
*Isabella City was the first community established in the township. It was located at E. River Road and S. Mission Road (formerly U.S. Highway 27). It was located on the north side of the Chippewa River, and its streets ran parallel and perpendicular to the river. Main Street and Fitch Street, now Craig Hill Road and E. River Road respectively, are the last remaining streets of the town. Only the part west of S. Mission Road, which runs at odds with the community&#x27;s platted streets, remains developed, while the rest of the city has been reclaimed by nature. Residents of the area now refer to the area as Dogtown, and the name Isabella City has been largely forgotten, though its plat is still recorded with the county records.
*Longwood was located between E. River Road and E. Airport Road (now Industrial Drive) off the east side of S. Mission Road (formerly U.S. Highway 27). This town was absorbed into the City of Mount Pleasant. Hardly any of its original buildings exist today.
*South Mount Pleasant existed off the north side of E. Deerfield Road between S. Crawford Road and S. Mission Road (formerly U.S. Highway 27). S. Washington Street use to extend from W. Broomfield Street to E. Deerfield Road and right at the intersection of Deerfield and Washington was where the town sat. Today the town has been turned into a biological wild life preserve for Central Michigan University, and no remnants of the town remain, though its plat is still recorded with the county records.

In 1842, the Michigan Central Railroad bypassed the original village and built a depot to the west when an offer of $1.50 an acre was offered (compared to $2.00 an acre at the previous city center) .

In 1887, Grass Lake was awarded a stone depot designed by the same architects, Spier and Rohns, and with stone from the same quarry as the Ann Arbor station. The historic Romanesque Whistle Stop Depot offers displays of local interest and is available for rental.

The Grass Lake Historical Society also operates the Coe House Museum. The home was constructed in 1871 for Henry Van Winkle, who owned and operated a hardware store and farm equipment dealership in Grass Lake. In 1972 the home was donated to the historical society by Mrs. Myrta Coe. This Tuscan Vernacular home has been furnished to represent a typical home of the Victorian Era.

==Lakes and ponds==

*Crispell Lake - Crispell Lake and Round Lake are the largest lakes in Liberty Township. It has some wetlands on parts of it, but is usable for boating; it is fairly deep but nothing over . It has two campgrounds on it, 4-H Camp McGregor, and Crispell Lake Campgrounds. The lake has boat ramps. The lake is on the far east side of the township. Crispell lake has a sister lake right across from her called Mud Lake. They are only about a quarter of a mile apart from each other; sometimes when it rains a lot the two lakes connect. The only thing between them is Springbrook Road and woods and wetland. Crispell Lake is larger than Mud Lake and has boats on it and campgrounds, and has more of a population on it.
*Grand Lake, one of the smaller lakes in Liberty Township, is at the headwaters of the Grand River. A small stream connects it to Mirror Lake upstream, which is about the same size. Mirror Lake used to be called Little Grand Lake and Grand Lake was called Big Grand Lake.
*Mirror Lake is one of the smaller lakes of Liberty Township; it connects with Grand Lake downstream. Mirror Lake used to be called Little Grand Lake, and Grand Lake was called Big Grand Lake. The lake has much of its population on the west shore and south shores; the north and east shore are wilder.
*Mud Lake is one of the larger lakes of Liberty Township. It is not very deep—maybe in some areas. It is sometimes considered a swamp because so many lily pads are on it in the summer, and no boats are ever on it. There are only a few houses on it, so it is pretty much all wildlife, with many waterfowl birds on it in the summer. It is one of the most scenic lakes in the township. Mud Lake has a sister lake called Crispell Lake, only a quarter of a mile away. They sometimes connect in the summer by a small creek when it rains a lot. Springbrook Road, woods, and wetlands are the only things between them.

Round Lake has more population on it than any other lake in Liberty Township, as the whole lake has houses around it, and it is fairly deep. Boats are allowed on the lake, and there are boat ramps and docks on the lake. There is also a public beach and playground, and tables. Round Lake&#x27;s west shore is on the border between Liberty Township and Hanover Township.
*Skiff Lake is one of the larger lakes of the township and one of the least populated. It may be the most scenic lake in the township, with many pine trees along the shores, and a few islands. A small stream leaves the lake and connects to the Grand River.

<text>Michigan Center is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jackson County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,672 at the 2010 census. The CDP is located within Leoni Township on the eastern border of the city of Jackson.

Michigan Center was platted as &quot;Michigan Centre&quot; in 1837 by Abel Fitch and Paul Ring, although there were settlements in the area from at least 1834. The name was presumably derived from the proximity to the Michigan meridian which divided the state into eastern and western portions for surveying. The community is not close to any sort of geographical center of the state. Fitch became the first postmaster in 1838.

Michigan Center began developing as a mill town on a tributary of the Grand River. There was a station on the Michigan Central Railroad. However, nearby Jackson rapidly outpaced Michigan Center, which has since become a bedroom community to the city.

Michigan Center is in eastern Jackson County, in the southern part of Leoni Township. The CDP shares a slight western border with the city of Jackson but is otherwise surrounded by Leoni Township on the north, east, and west with a southern boundary with Napoleon Township.

The community is situated primarily around the northern end of Center Lake, formed by a dam on a tributary of the Grand River in 1911. Several other nearby lakes on the same tributary form a connected chain of lakes: Round Lake, Price Lake, Moon Lake, Little Dollar Lake, Dollar Lake, Olcott Lake, Little Olcott Lake, Wolf Lake and Little Wolf Lake. Local residents travel between the first several lakes using small boats or personal watercraft.

In 1830, land entries were recorded for William Harris for the southwest quarter of section 17 and Major G. Van Dwyer for the southwest quarter of section 13 (the eastern portion of the section is now part of Galesburg). In 1831 land entries were recorded for Horace H. Comstock, Caleb Eldred, Thomas W. Merrill, Mumford Eldred, Stephen Eldred, Leland Lane, and others. Settling in the eastern part of the township in or near what is now Galesburg were Nathaniel Matthews, Ralph Tuttle, Sherman Cummings, George Townsend, and Nathan Cothren. H. H. Comstock, Caleb Eldred, and Cryus Lovell settled in the western part of the township near what became Comstock.

<text>Kalamazoo Charter Township is a charter township of Kalamazoo County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 22,777 at the 2020 census.

The cities of Kalamazoo and Parchment are adjacent to the township and have annexed much land that was formerly within the township, such that the township now consists of two non-contiguous sections of land and one small section that is connected by a narrow point across Riverview Drive. Two census-designated places (CDPs) are within the township: Eastwood and Westwood. These are defined for statistical purposes and do not have any legal status as municipalities. However, both have an identity as communities, although the areas defined by the CDPs may not precisely correspond to local use of the terms. The CDPs can include nearby areas that locals might not consider as part of the community with the same name.

Kalamazoo Township was initially organized under the name of &quot;Arcadia Township&quot; by an act of the Territorial Legislature on July 30, 1830. A separate act on the same day organized the government of Kalamazoo County. Initially Arcadia Township consisted of all eight of the northern tier of townships in Kalamazoo County. In June 1832, Richland Township was set off, consisting of Richland, Ross, Charleston, and Comstock townships. On March 2, 1836, Arcadia Township was renamed as Kalamazoo Township, the same day that the village of Bronson was renamed as Kalamazoo. On March 11, 1837, Cooper Township was set off, consisting of Cooper and Alamo townships. On March 22, 1839, Oshtemo Township was set off from Kalamazoo.

<text>Parchment is a city in Kalamazoo County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The 2020 census recorded a population of 1,926. The name is derived from the parchment company that used to manufacture paper on the East bank of the Kalamazoo River.

Parchment is located just northeast of the city of Kalamazoo, and it is mostly surrounded by Kalamazoo Township.

==History ==
The Kalamazoo Vegetable Parchment Company was founded in 1909. The founder, Jacob &quot;Uncle Jake&quot; Kindleberger, set up shop along the Kalamazoo River. The company then started selling pieces of land located around the mill to the mill workers. In 1932, Kindleberger left a tract of located in the center of the city; this later became Kindleberger Park in his honor. In 1939, Parchment became a city by a majority vote. It has been known as The Paper City since then. Over the years, the KVP Company was bought by or merged with other companies, including Sutherland Paper Company, Brown Company, James River, and finally Crown-Vantage. In 2000 paper making in Parchment ended, and thereafter the city has struggled to sustain itself. Its population has debated what to do with the old paper mill property. As of 2011, the first mill building was demolished with plans to demolish the other building at a later date.

=== Contamination ===
The mill site came under scrutiny again in July 2018, when the city discovered fluorosurfactant (PFAS) contamination in the drinking water. Samples from Parchment&#x27;s water system showed the drinking water was contaminated with PFAS at a level of 1,587-ppt—over 20 times the EPA limit. Residents were advised to stop using the water for drinking/cooking immediately, while the city worked to discover the source of the contamination. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder declared a State of Emergency on July 29. Bottled water was distributed to residents by volunteers, and the City of Kalamazoo connected its water system to Parchment. Because of the unknown source of the PFAS, and the associated costs for new wells and testing, Mayor Robert Britigan III predicted that Parchment will have to permanently use Kalamazoo&#x27;s drinking water.

The source of the PFAS contamination has not been discovered, but officials believe a former landfill along the Kalamazoo River may be the source. The landfill site is also the former home of the paper mill in the city, and the landfill was capped in 2000 after then-owner Crown-Vantage went bankrupt. PFAS have been known to be used in paper-making and associated paper-manufacturing processes.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Parchment is east of the Kalamazoo River.

==Demographics==

In the November 2010 gubernatorial election, 588 ballots were cast in the city of Parchment.

==Schools==
The city of Parchment has three elementary schools, one middle school, one high school, and Barclay Hills Education Center, an alternative public school. Parchment High School was built in 1959 to accommodate the city&#x27;s growing population. Prior to 1959, Parchment students went through 8th grade and then went to Kalamazoo Central High School. In the mid 1950s Kalamazoo Public school district was considering annexing Parchment into their district. Laurence Tisch, who read water meters for the city started a petition with his wife Jean Tisch to build a new High School. The community was successful in purchasing property and the school was built. The first class graduated in 1961.

<doc id="117803" wikidata="Q7237961" url="?curid=117803" title="Prairie Ronde Township, Michigan">
<text>Prairie Ronde Township is a civil township located in the southwestern corner of Kalamazoo County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 2,369 at the 2020 census.

Prairie Ronde is the birthplace of the women&#x27;s suffragist Olympia Brown.

==Geography==
The township is bordered by Van Buren County to the west, Cass County at the southwest corner, and St. Joseph County to the south. Kalamazoo, the county seat, is to the northeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.73%, are water.

There are no incorporated or unincorporated communities within the boundaries of the township. A village named Shirland, to be located on Section 25 (near the present-day Olde Mill Golf Course), was platted and recorded in 1831, but it never developed. The village of Schoolcraft is just to the east in Schoolcraft Township, and all of Prairie Ronde Township is served by the Schoolcraft ZIP code (49087).

Surface water features include Harrison and Paw Paw Lakes in the northern part of the township. Much of the township lies within the drainage area of Flowerfield Creek, which is part of the Rocky River sub-watershed, itself part of the larger St. Joseph River watershed. The Michigan Nature Association maintains a nature sanctuary along Flowerfield Creek in Prairie Ronde Township.

==History==
The township is named for its distinctive geographic feature, the Prairie Ronde, a grassland and the largest of the eight prairies in what would become Kalamazoo County. The name &quot;Prairie Ronde&quot; (French for &quot;round meadow&quot;) is said to have been given by French explorer Robert Sieur de la Salle during an overland crossing of the region in 1680. (Some scholars, however, place LaSalle&#x27;s route across northern Kalamazoo County, a journey which would not have brought him across the Prairie Ronde.)

Present-day Prairie Ronde Township was the first part of Kalamazoo County to be settled by European-Americans. The first white settler was Bazel Harrison, a nephew of revolutionary leader Benjamin Harrison and first cousin of U.S. President William Henry Harrison. Originally of Virginia, Harrison arrived with his family from Ohio on November 5, 1828.

At the time of settlement, Prairie Ronde was a part of St. Joseph County and in the township of Brady, which included all of future Kalamazoo and Barry counties and a large part of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula to the north. Kalamazoo County was set off with its present boundaries in 1829, and the southern half organized as Brady Township in 1830. Prairie Ronde was set off from Brady Township as a separate township with its present limits in May 1836.

At the time of European settlement, the area was inhabited by the Potawatomi people. The Potawatomi were forcibly removed from Kalamazoo County in October 1840.

A Methodist congregation was organized in Prairie Ronde in 1832. In 1836 they built a small chapel near Harrison Lake called the Ebenezer Episcopal Church of Prairie Ronde. This was the first church building of any denomination built north of the St. Joseph River.

Still owned by Fanckboner descendants, the family&#x27;s Greek Revival farmhouse, built c. 1840, along with later outbuildings, stands in a small farmstead area at one corner of the farm property on the corner of West VW Avenue and S 10th Street. The farmstead, added to the Register in 2007, is preserved as an illustration of the lives of the early settlers on the Prairie Ronde.

==History==
Richland is located in the middle of what was once the Gull Prairie, an upland area relatively free of trees and maintained by natural and man-made fires. The area had a few Pottawatamie villages, one was located on the west side of nearby Gull Lake. Fish and game were plentiful, and the land was very fertile. Since there were few trees to clear, the prairie was among the first areas of Kalamazoo County to be settled. By the 1830s, the Native Americans had been forced west, and Richland was a thriving frontier village. The village even contended with Prairie Ronde for the county seat, but the centrally-located village of Bronson (now Kalamazoo) was ultimately chosen.

Lacking a flowing stream that would have provided water power, Richland never developed significant industry and remained a sleepy farm community until the late twentieth century. In the 1980s and 1990s, small employers such as Richard Allen Medical moved to the edge of town, and Richland became a bedroom community for Kalamazoo. The high quality of the local Gull Lake School District also drew people from surrounding areas. New subdivisions were built in what had been hilly farm country.

==Notable people==
Brothers Charles S. May and Dwight May, both lieutenant governors of Michigan during the 19th Century, were raised in Richland.
