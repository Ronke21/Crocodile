<text>Twentynine Palms (also known as 29 Palms) is a city in San Bernardino County, California. It serves as one of the entry points to Joshua Tree National Park and the Mojave Desert region.

== History ==

Native Americans, such as the Serrano, Chemehuevi and Cahuilla peoples, lived in the area. Colonel Henry Washington made the first recorded exploration of Twentynine Palms, where he found people of the Chemehuevi who lived in the surrounding hills and near the spring they called &quot;Mar-rah&quot; or &quot;Oasis of Mara&quot;. The community was named for the 29 palms (&quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;) that the Serrano had planted surrounding the Oasis of Mara. Nearby is also a small Indian reservation belonging to the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians. 

A post office was established in 1927. A road named Utah Trail honors the late-19th century wagon trains and pioneers, allegedly originating in St. George, Utah, and stretching all the way to Twentynine Palms. 

Joshua Tree National Park, which lies just to the south of Twentynine Palms, was designated a US national monument in 1936, and became a national park in 1994. The nearby Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms was founded in 1952.

<text>Bessemer is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 1,805. It is the county seat of Gogebic County.

The city is surrounded by Bessemer Township, but the two are administered autonomously. It is on U.S. Route 2 with Ironwood to the west and Wakefield to the east. The Big Powderhorn and Snow River ski resorts are located within a few miles of Bessemer. Cross-country skiing and snowmobiling are also very popular in this area, due to lake-effect snow influenced by nearby Lake Superior; the area is often referred to as &quot;Big Snow Country.&quot; Recreational opportunities in the summer months include Bluff Valley Park, the scenic Black River Falls, and access to the Iron Belle Trail.

== History ==

In 1880, a hunter and trapper Richard Langford, discovered iron ore under an overturned birch tree. However, Captain N. D. Moore is credited with disclosing the ore which led to the development of the Colby property. Mining began in 1883. By 1884, the Milwaukee Lake Shore and Western Railroad (later the Chicago and Northwestern) was being built from Antigo, WI to Ashland, WI by way of the new mines. The railroad company plotted the town of Bessemer in 1884. On June 4, 1886 Gogebic County was separated from Ontonagon County. In March 1887, 360 voting members assembled and voted to organize the village of Bessemer. In the same year Gogebic County was officially created by the Michigan Legislature. Also in the year Bessemer and Ironwood called an election to see which city would be the county seat and also have the Gogebic County Courthouse. Ironwood men traveling to Bessemer to vote were made drunk and the train did not stop at the voting site. Ironwood lost and Bessemer gained the county seat. From 1884 to December 31, 1958, a period of seventy-five years, the iron ore shipment from all of Gogebic County totaled over 245 million tons. In 1966 the last mine in Bessemer, the Peterson Mine, closed. Many left the area to work in car factories in Kenosha, and the local economy underwent a serious decline.

Bessemer is named for Sir Henry Bessemer (1813-1898), English inventor of steel manufacturing.

== Government ==

<text>Ironwood is a city in Gogebic County in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan, about south of Lake Superior. The city is on US Highway 2 across the Montreal River from Hurley, Wisconsin. It is the westernmost city in Michigan, situated on the same line of longitude (90.2 degrees West) as Clinton, Iowa and St. Louis, Missouri. The population was 5,045 at the 2020 census, down from 5,387 at the 2010 census. The city is bordered by Ironwood Township to the north, but the two are administered autonomously.

While originally an iron mining town, the area is now known for its downhill skiing resorts, including Big Powderhorn, Black River, Snow River, Mount Zion and Whitecap as well as its cross country skiing at the Wolverine Nordic Trail System and the ABR Nordic Center.

Ironwood is home of the &quot;World&#x27;s Tallest Indian,&quot; a fiberglass statue of tribal leader Hiawatha.

==History==
Ironwood was settled in the spring of 1885. The town was incorporated as a village in 1887 and as a city on April 8, 1889. The township area north of the city was incorporated as Ironwood Township on April 8, 1889. In 1890 the population of Ironwood passed 7,500 and in 1900 it reached 10,000. Ironwood reputedly acquired its name when Frederic W. Rhinelander, president of the Milwaukee Lake Shore and Western Railroad line, arriving by train at what was then little more than a wilderness camp, chose it to honor one of his employees, mining captain James (Iron) Wood.

Ironwood is located within the now inactive Gogebic Iron Range. Iron ore was found in the area in the 1870s. The arrival of the railroad in the mid-1880s gave an impetus to more extensive development of the area&#x27;s ore deposits. Several mines, such as the Norrie, Aurora, Ashland, Newport, and Pabst, were opened in Ironwood. The mines and the lumber works attracted newcomers from other parts of the US and from European countries such as England, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Sweden.

On September 17, 1887, a disastrous fire swept over half the business area, although the buildings that were lost were quickly rebuilt. In 1926, the Pabst Mine Disaster occurred, killing three electricians and trapping forty-three miners for up to five days.

By the early 1890s, twelve churches had been established in Ironwood by the various immigrant communities: 
* The Methodist Episcopal Church
* The Jessieville Methodist Episcopal Church
* St Ambrose Church (Catholic)
* St Michael&#x27;s Church (Catholic)
* First Swedish Baptist Church
* Swedish Methodist Episcopal Church
* Swedish Mission Church (Covenant Church)
* Swedish Lutheran Church
* First Finnish Lutheran Church
* The First Presbyterian Church
* St Pauls Episcopal Church
* The First Apostolic Lutheran Church

In the early 1960s, the U.S. Air Force established a Strategic Air Command (SAC) Radar Bomb Scoring site atop Norrie hill to track and score high altitude and treetop level simulated bomb runs by B-52s and B-47s on targets in the Ironwood area. A monument is erected south of Hurley, Wisconsin to remember those crew members killed in two B-47 low level runs. The site was moved to Charlevoix, Michigan in the mid-1960s.

IPSD, as the department is now known, continues to be the only full-time fire department in the Western Upper Peninsula. The Public Safety Department is also supplemented by the volunteer fire department which has been in operation since 1887.

<text>Wakefield is a city in Gogebic County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,702 at the 2020 census.

Wakefield is located in the western Upper Peninsula about east of the Wisconsin border. The city is mostly surrounded by Wakefield Township, but the two are administered autonomously. U.S. Route 2 passes through the city, and M-28 has its western terminus in the city.

It is home to Sunday Lake, Snow River Mountain Resort, Gogebic County Medical Care Facility, and Gogebic County Community Mental Health Authority. Once a mining town, the economy is now based upon the forest industry, goods and services, and tourism.

==History==

===Founding===
George Mix Wakefield, born February 6, 1839, in Henderson, New York, a son of James Patterson Wakefield and Hannah B. Hall, had the town site of Wakefield platted in May 1886; the general location was already being referred to as &quot;Wakefield&quot; as early as the fall of 1884. His parents moved their family to Waukesha County, Wisconsin in October 1844. Mr. Wakefield became interested in logging and real estate and acquired vast tracts of land in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the 1870s and 1880s. Together with various other capitalists he built sawmills and logged the pine forests of the area, and later became involved in mineral exploration. He was one of the parties who held interests in the mineral rights to the Sunday Lake mine, as well as a few nearby properties.

===George M. Wakefield===
Mr. Wakefield moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1879 and established a real estate business, dealing in timber and mineral lands in Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, and Alaska. He was secretary-treasurer of the Ontonagon River Improvement and Boom Company, organized in 1880. They made it possible to float logs out to Lake Superior and built a sawmill on an island near the mouth of the Ontonagon River in Ontonagon, Michigan.

The G. M. Wakefield Mineral Land Company was formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 18, 1899, for the purpose of dealing in mineral lands, timber, agricultural lands, and real estate. George M. Wakefield, his wife and their son Vernon T. Wakefield were the stockholders with a capital stock of $50,000 divided into 500 shares. Most of the land held was in Township 47 North, between Wakefield and Lake Gogebic. Mr. Wakefield was also a major stockholder in the Beacon, Continental, Cosmos, International, and Summit mineral land companies.

The Wakefield ancestry is traced back to John Wakefield, who was born about 1614, probably in Gravesend, County Kent, England and immigrated to Virginia aboard the &quot;America&quot; in June 1635, along with his brothers Richard Wakefield and Thomas Wakefield. John Wakefield eventually settled at Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts.

===Incorporation===
Wakefield was incorporated as a village by the Gogebic County Board of Supervisors on November 20, 1887. It became incorporated as a city in 1919.


===Mining boom===
The founding of Wakefield and much of its early history was based upon the discovery of iron ore on the east end of Sunday Lake by George A. Fay in 1881. Upon its discovery, several mining companies rushed to the area and many mines opened. Villages such as Plymouth, Pike, Castile, and Comet got their names from these iron mines. The first mines in Wakefield were the Sunday Lake, Iron Chief, and the Brotherton. According to the Gogebic Range Directory of 1888, the output of these mines in 1886 was as follows: Sunday Lake, 13,00 tons; Iron Chief, 9,584 tons, and the Brotherton, about 3,500 tons.

Wakefield&#x27;s iron mines include:

* MIKADO Captain John Lester did pioneering work on the MIKADO in 1886. Development occurred off and on for several years, until the first ore was shipped in 1895. The mine is credited with shipping over one million tons from 1895 to 1917. Shipments from 1919 to 1952 were sent under the PLYMOUTH name. The MIKADO mine was located on the northwest end of the open pit, in Verona location.
* PILGRIM Explorations began on this location in the spring of 1886 under Captain Harry Letcher. Nothing was shipped until 1919–27 when the PILGRIM made shipments of twenty-two thousand tons. The PILGRIM was located just east of the MIKADO.
* PLYMOUTH The PLYMOUTH open-pit mine operated just to the west of the WAKEFIELD, but the PLYMOUTH was entirely an open pit operation, with the possible exception of a small amount of ore taken out of the No.3 shaft as it was being sunk. It began shipping in 1916 and closed on November 6, 1952, having shipped almost seventeen million tons.
* WAKEFIELD Drill exploration began on the WAKEFIELD property in July 1912, and two shafts were down by the following summer. The first ore shipment was made on October 15, 1913. The WAKEFIELD soon became an open-pit mine, shipping a total of almost fourteen million gross tons from 1913 to 1954.
* CITY OF CHICAGO Exploration began in the latter part of 1886 at this location on the north shore of Sunday lake. The SPARTA operated on the same location in 1888 and the CITY OF CHICAGO returned in 1896, eventually producing shipments of almost one hundred thousand tons of ore between 1896 and 1915. It was also called the SOUTH CHICAGO in 1915.
* SPARTA The former CITY OF CHICAGO exploration became the SPARTA in 1888. It was developed and shipped almost ten thousand tons from 1891 to 1895.
* ALPHA In the summer of 1886 the Alpha Iron Mining Company sank a shaft near the north shore of Sunday lake. By 1890 this location was taken over by the PIKE mine.
* PIKE Captain Robinson D. Pike (1838–1906) of Bayfield, Wisconsin took over the former ALPHA option in 1889. Ten years later the PIKE made its first shipment, with total shipments of over one hundred five thousand tons from 1899 to 1910. In 1927 the PIKE became part of the SUNDAY LAKE GROUP.
* BROTHERTON Frank H. Brotherton began mineral explorations near Sunday lake in the summer of 1883. The first iron ore was shipped from the mine in 1886, with total shipments amounting to two million six hundred ninety thousand tons by the time the mine closed in 1923.
* SUNDAY LAKE This location was first explored in 1881 by George Fay. Development picked up by 1884, and the first iron shipment left port at Ashland on November 19, 1885. The SUNDAY LAKE mine later encompassed all of Section 10 and the former BROTHERTON mine. Over seventeen million gross tons of ore went out from 1885 to 1961. The mine closed on February 16, 1961.
* IRON CHIEF Development of the IRON CHIEF mine began in 1884 under the Fink Mining Company. It was originally called the ASCHERMANN for Edward Aschermann (18341904) of Appleton, Wisconsin. The mine shipped about twelve thousand tons of iron ore in 1886 and 1887.
* CASTILE Captain Pentecost Mitchell (1861–1933) discovered iron ore on this location in 1886. The CASTILE began producing in 1906 and shipped almost nine hundred thousand tons of ore by the time it closed in 1923.
* METEOR The METEOR started as an exploration in 1890, called the NORTON. It was developed into a mine by 1900 and operated until 1904, shipping one hundred thirty-two thousand tons between 1899 and 1904. Over six million tons of stockpile ore went under the name NORTH MIKADO.
* COMET Captain Pentecost Mitchell found ore here and an exploration called the ECLlPSE was developed from 1886 to 1890. The COMET began in 1890 making its first ore shipment in August. The COMET was shut down in 1893 reopening in 1900 and operating until 1902 as part of the METEOR mine. It is credited with shipments of eighty-nine thousand tons in 1890–93.
* MORGAN The MORGAN mine east of Wakefield was developed in 1918–23 and made its first ore shipment on January 30, 1923. It operated until 1925 and shipped over fifty-eight thousand tons.
* VICAR The easternmost productive mine on the Gogebic Range covered most of Section 12, east of Wakefield. This location was once called the JONES &amp; LAUGHLIN exploration and included the old PHOENIX exploration that dated back to 1887. The VICAR shipped about one hundred two thousand tons in 1950–51.

==Post-mining era==

After the closure of the Sunday Lake Mine on February 16, 1961, the local economy shifted from one of mining to the forest industry, goods and services and tourism.

Logging had been a mainstay of the local economy since the early 1900s. In 1941, the county embarked upon a county forest project to demonstrate that with selective cutting, under proper management, forests could be perpetuated, of increasing value and quality. By 1956, the project included out of the total of in the county and Ottawa National Forest harvesting marked hardwoods, aspen, and conifer. In support of the local lumber industry, many successful lumber, trucking, equipment sales, and logging businesses have existed in Wakefield and many continue to do so today. They all support the larger industries of lumber and plywood mills located in Gogebic County and outlying areas.

After the local mining jobs were lost, many in the community began providing goods and services, which included restaurants, food markets, bakery, bars, gas stations, hardware stores, drug stores and other commerce that supports the needs of the community.

With an average of of annual snowfall, the city greatly benefits from winter tourism. Indianhead Mountain opened in 1959 and has grown to become a major tourist magnet in both winter and summer. Snowmobile trails, cross-country skiing trails, and ice fishing on Sunday Lake have also drawn many tourists to the city during the winter months. During the summer, hiking, camping, fishing, and on occasion American Power Boat Association boat races on Sunday Lake contribute to a growing local tourist industry. As a typical small town, many are drawn back to participate in the annual old-fashioned July 4 celebration. The week-long event includes softball tournaments, high school class reunions, homecoming church services, town picnic and concert at Eddy Park, a Sunday Lake run contest, Main Street parade, children&#x27;s races, and fireworks display over Sunday Lake.

==2016 storm==
Severe storms struck the Gogebic Range during the late evening of July 11, 2016 and the early morning of July 12, 2016. The storm produced flash floods across the area and one confirmed EF0 tornado in nearby Bessemer Township. In particular, the city of Wakefield was struck with a thunderstorm with straight-line winds around 90 mph which downed numerous trees and power lines, turned over a camper trailer, and tore the roof off of a former ice rink along Sunday Lake. Following the storm, parts of the city remained without power for a considerable time before crews could restore power.

==Community==
===City Hall===
The City Hall is located at 509 Sunday Lake Street (Formerly the Father Daniel Hall). City departments include Water and Electric, Public Works, and Finance. The City Staff operate from the building and Department of Public Works garage which include:

*Building Inspector
*City Assessor
*City Manager
*City Clerk
*City Treasurer
*Utilities
*Department of Public Works Working Foreman
*Assistant DPW
*Electric/Water Department Working Foreman

On September 17, 2014, the City Council voted unanimously to approve a one-year Lease with Option to Purchase Agreement with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette for Father Daniel Hall (FDH). That fall the old City Hall closed and the City government moved into FDH. Plans to repair or replace the old City Hall had been discussed for decades. The boilers and some bathrooms were not functioning, the exterior required extensive tuck-pointing and repair, and the building did not meet ADA standards. Many of the offices were in need of rewiring and required structural repairs. Many of the other areas were no longer utilized. As conditions deteriorated the cost of keeping the doors open increased year after year. Conversely, FDH had seen significant improvements. In 2013, the roof was replaced, and the boilers are functioning. All of the rooms are on one floor, and the entrance is handicap accessible, offering access to all residents. The new City Hall, now called the municipal building, was purchased in October 2015 for $101,899 using general funds.

===City Council===
The City Council consists of the Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem, and three council members who are elected for two-year terms.

===City commissions===
Active commissions include:
*Civil Service
*Planning
*Housing Commission

===Development projects===
Current projects are:
*Walking trail and lights along the southwest shoreline of Sunday Lake.
*New playground equipment at Eddy Park.
*Memorial Building demolition project.
*Renaissance Tax-Free Zone through the Michigan Renaissance Zone Act of 1996 created for both economically distressed urban and rural areas alike. Renaissance Zones are a powerful market-based program designed to spur new jobs, investment, and redevelopment in designated areas. The City of Wakefield renaissance zone is 47 acres in size and provides participating companies the advantage of tax-free incentives until 2017.

===Memorial Building===

Completed in 1924 on the south shore of Sunday Lake, the Wakefield Memorial Building was the center of the community. At a cost of $400,000 it was dedicated to the youth who fought in World War I. It housed a banquet area, meeting rooms, an olympic size swimming pool, and a 1,200 seat movie theater with main floor and balcony seating. By the late 1950s after the local iron mines closed, the major tax base was lost and the city no longer had adequate funds to operate the Memorial Building. During the ensuing decades, other entities owned the building but little was done to sustain it. The harsh winters soon destroyed the roof and the building was soon structurally unsound and in a dilapidated state.

In July 2004, Marvin Suomi, a 1965 graduate of Wakefield High School purchased the Wakefield Memorial Building. Headed by Mr. Suomi, the Wakefield Memorial Building Foundation was established as a 501(c)(3) organization with the goal of constructing a new, smaller, energy efficient/sustainable building. Federal and state funding were dependent upon a series of environmental reviews and assessments by both the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. The State Historic Preservation Office did not want the old building torn down but after lengthy negotiations a consensus was reached by the project coordinator and shortly thereafter the City Council approved the demolition. By late spring 2010 the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office approved the archival records compiled of the memorial building and Wakefield City Hall. HUD then released $147,000 in federal funds that were used to pay for the demolition. Demolition of the old Memorial Building began on July 6, 2010, and was complete on August 28, 2010. Twelve stained-glass windows from the theater auditorium were salvaged for restoration and use in the new building design. In July 2011 the City Council in conjunction with the Wakefield Memorial Building Foundation, decided to remove a roughly theater from the plans for a building. The new building will function as a community center and house city offices, the city library, and a swimming pool. When the project is complete, the new building will be operated by the city and utilized by the entire community. It is currently unknown if or when the project will proceed.

===Education===
*The Wakefield-Marenisco School is located on the southeast shore of Sunday Lake. The first building on site was erected in 1890, and the first high school (Mary McDonald) in 1909. By 2003–2004 the renovated high school building housed 4 year olds through grade 12. The 2004–2005 school year saw the consolidation of the Wakefield-Marenisco School District. The merging of the two communities ended the existence of the respective districts individual schools. The combined districts have approximately 300 students.
*Central School Elementary closed in 2000. In 2001 the elementary students moved into the high school building.
*Mary McDonald School established in 1909. It was demolished in 1974.

===Wakefield Public Library===
The Wakefield Public Library was opened to the public on February 4, 1935. It was originally located on the second floor of the City Hall building on Sunday Lake Street. It is now located at 401 Hancock Street. The dream for the library dates back to Oct 17, 1934 when a group of local citizens concerned about the literary heritage of their community decided to take action. They felt that a measurement of the cultural concerns of a community could be made through the literary pursuits of its citizens. The city of Wakefield made its first appropriation of $1,000 to lay the groundwork of the fine community facility we enjoy today. The Wakefield Public Library serves the City and Township of Wakefield. With help from the &quot;Friends of the Library&quot; it has received some needed renovations. In 2005, the children&#x27;s section was totally remodeled followed by the &quot;teen section&quot; in 2006.

<doc id="117511" wikidata="Q835096" url="?curid=117511" title="Leek, Netherlands">
<text>Leek (; ; ) is a village and former municipality in Groningen province in the northeastern Netherlands. The municipality, which bordered the Drenthe and Friesland provinces, was merged into the municipality of Westerkwartier on 1 January 2019.

The village of Leek is approximately 20 km west of Groningen (city) on the A7 (E22) highway.

The village grew around a fortification that was constructed during the Eighty Years&#x27; War with Spain. The name &#x27;Leek&#x27; was derived from a brook, the &quot;Leke&quot;. The town is sometimes also called &quot;&quot;De Leek&quot;. In Dutch, the people from Leek are called &quot;Leeksters&quot;&quot;.

Every year around Pentecost there is a fair (&quot;Pinkstermarkt&quot;), drawing thousands of people from the area.

Near the village is a shallow lake, the Leekstermeer (also known as &quot;Zulthermeer&quot;), with recreational facilities, but the lake is in another municipality and in another province.

== Attractions in Leek ==

The main attraction in the village is the &quot;Nienoord&quot; estate. The estate was founded in 1508. After a destroying fire, a new manor-house was built in 1887. The gardens and the shell grotto were restored.

The National Carriage Museum is located in this manor-house. In 1958 the National Carriage Museum rented the house and gardens. The National Carriage Museum presents an overall view of the various types of carriages and sleighs from the 18th to the 20th century. The 250 coaches in the museum&#x27;s collection were used by farmers, the common man, noblemen and royalty.

In the estate is situated a recreation park (Family-park Nienoord) with model railways in several scales, including live steam.

In Tolbert and Midwolde are churches from the 12th century. The churches are built in the Romano-Gothic style. Typical for this style are the walls and gables of brick that are richly decorated with recesses and patterns of bricks.

In the church of Midwolde is a tomb monument sculpted by Rombout Verhulst. Rombout Verhulst also decorated the tomb of Michiel de Ruyter in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam.

<text>Watersmeet Township is a civil township of Gogebic County in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,456 in 2020.

The Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation is located in two small segments within Watersmeet Township.

==History==
The Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation was established by treaty under the United States in 1854. The Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, part of the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa Indians, have occupied this territory since the 17th century. The band owns and operates a resort on the reservation, which includes a casino and golf course.

The unincorporated community of Watersmeet is within the township on the middle branch of the Ontonagon River near the junction of U.S. Highway 2 and U.S. Highway 45 at . The European-American community of Watersmeet was platted in 1884, designated as a station of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railways.

The now-explained Lights of Paulding occur nearby.

==Schools==
In late 2003 and early 2004, the boys&#x27; high school basketball team of the K-12 Watersmeet Township School was featured in a series of commercials on ESPN. ESPN chose Watersmeet for the commercials in part because of the school&#x27;s sport teams&#x27; unusual nickname of &quot;Nimrods&quot;. The tag line of the commercials was &quot;Without sports, who would cheer for the Nimrods?&quot; The ads were so popular that the team, its coach, and octogenarian fan Dale Jenkins, all of whom were featured on the commercials, appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on March 15, 2004.

The township and the Nimrods are the focus of an 8-part documentary, &quot;Nimrod Nation&quot;, which aired on The Sundance Channel. Filming started in September 2005 and continued until June 2006. Actor Robert Redford, one of the channel&#x27;s owners and a champion of Native American issues, was reported to have been inspired to make the documentary when he learned that Watersmeet Township School&#x27;s student body (and varsity basketball team) was approximately 50 percent Native American. The documentary won a Peabody Award in 2007.

Since that time, the township has consolidated schools. At the time, 9-12 grade enrollment was 78; the school system absorbed 13 of neighboring Marenisco&#x27;s 60 K-12 students. The Watersmeet township high school enrollment in 2005-2006 enrollment was a total of 96.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (8.30%) is water.

=== Climate ===
The climate is described as Humid Continental by the Köppen Climate System, abbreviated as &quot;Dfb&quot;.
==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,472 people, 552 households, and 385 families residing in the township. In 2020, its population was 1,456.

==Transportation==
Indian Trails provides daily intercity bus service between St. Ignace and Ironwood, Michigan.

<text>Reiderland () is a former municipality in the province Groningen in the northeastern Netherlands, which was founded in 1990 during a large municipal reorganisation. The former municipalities Finsterwolde and Bad Nieuweschans were abolished and added to Beerta. In 1992, the new municipality was given its current name. In 2010 it joined in the municipality Oldambt.

==Politics==

Reiderland was one of the few municipalities in the Netherlands that still had communist councillors after the dissolution of the Communist Party of the Netherlands in 1989. (As of 2006, it was one of only four Dutch municipalities to have any, the other three being Heiloo, Scheemda and Lemsterland.) The New Communist Party of the Netherlands was in fact the largest party in Reiderland from 1990 to 1998 and again from 2002 to 2006. Finsterwolde and Beerta, which was the only town in the Netherlands that ever had a communist mayor, had long been communist strongholds.

In the 1998 municipal election, the New Communist Party of the Netherlands received 35.7% of the votes, behind the Labour Party&#x27;s 40.3%, but in 2002 it received 34.1%, ahead of the Labour Party&#x27;s 24.7%. It won five of the thirteen seats on the local council and formed the Court of Mayor and the Aldermen in alliance with local party Gemeentebelangen, although the two parties were traditionally foes. In the 2006 election, however, the NCPN lost 3 of its 5 seats, getting only 18.3% of the vote, behind the Labour Party&#x27;s 38.1%, Gemeentebelangen&#x27;s 20.4%, and the Socialist Party&#x27;s 19.0%, and consequently lost its positions on the Court of Mayor and Aldermen. For the remaining years of the municipality&#x27;s existence, the Labour Party&#x27;s had 5 seats on the local council, the Socialist Party 3 seats, local party Gemeentebelangen 3 seats as well, and the NCPN 2 seats.

Reiderland also drew some attention in the 2002 general election, when the Pim Fortuyn List received 22.9% of the vote in the municipality, the party&#x27;s best result in the province of Groningen.

== Population centres ==

Towns and villages in the municipality include:
* Beersterhoogen
* Beerta

==The old Reiderland==

Much of the area has been re-empoldered since. See List of settlements lost to floods in the Netherlands#Drowned villages in Groningen province.

<text>Winschoten (; ) is a city with a population of 18,518 in the municipality of Oldambt in the northeast of the Netherlands. It is the largest city in the region of Oldambt in the province of Groningen which has 38,213 inhabitants.

Winschoten received its city rights in 1825. It was a separate municipality until it was merged into Oldambt in 2010. The seat of government of Oldambt is in Winschoten.

There are three windmills and several churches in Winschoten. There is a railway station with direct connections to Groningen and Leer (Germany), although due to the reconstruction of the Friesenbrücke trains to Germany will stop at Weener until 2024. Winschoten has an important role as a shopping centre for the region of Oldambt. In the province of Groningen, it is the second-largest shopping destination and it attracts many consumers from nearby Germany.

== Etymology ==


The origin of the name of Winschoten is not known but it has received nicknames. One of these is &quot;Molenstad&quot; (or &quot;Milltown&quot;). It has also been known, in living memory, as Sodom. This name arose out of the Jewish community who were scandalised by the immoral behaviour of their Gentile neighbours. The inhabitants are also called &quot;Tellerlikkers&quot; (plate lickers).

==Geography==
Winschoten was the capital of the Oldambt district, in a fertile agricultural region. Winschoten received city rights in 1825. It was the last town in the Netherlands to be granted such rights and it was more of a symbolic gesture. The town flag has three horizontal stripes of blue and white, in ratio 1:3:1, on the white stripe is a red outline plan of a fortress with nine embattlements. It was adopted 23 May 1973 by municipal resolution. The coat of arms is an image of Saint Vitus, whose name can also be recognized in many streetnames, schoolnames names of clubs, etc.

Winschoten is located at (53.15, 7.03) in the municipality of Oldambt, in the east of the province of Groningen, and in the northeast of the Netherlands. It is situated east of Groningen, Hoogezand, and Veendam, north of Stadskanaal, south of Delfzijl, and west of Leer and Papenburg (both in Germany). It is also south of the Dollart and the Oldambtmeer.

==Windmills==
There used to be 13 mills in Winschoten, today only three large, monumental windmills remain in the town. These mills are now owned by the local council and are run by volunteer millers. They form an important feature of the townscape and are well cared for by the local authorities for the benefit of the community and visitors.

Molen Berg, built in 1854 at the Grintweg, was designed to grind corn. Its first owner was J.D. Buurma. The unusual design of the sails with movable blades, akin to venetian blinds was in advance for its time. Traditionally Dutch windmills have tarpaulin covering the sails to control or catch the wind&#x27;s power.

The Dijkstra Molen in the Nassaustraat was built in 1862 by D.E. Dijkstra. In 1953 the original owner&#x27;s grandson sold it to the local government. It was restored 1982/1983 and further restoration work took place in 1995/-6 restoration.

Molen Edens, at Nassaustraat 14, was built in 1763 on the instructions of Jurrien Balles and Antje Gerbrands. Later owners were Jan Joesten and G. Eikema. Then from 1855 till 1960 various generations of the Edens family owned it. The local municipality bought it in 1960. It is the oldest mill in the entire province of Groningen.

==Churches==
There are numerous Protestant churches in Winschoten including an assembly of Plymouth Brethren. The oldest church dates back to the 13th century in style mingling Roman and Gothic features. There is a Dutch Reformed church on Marktplein. A free-standing 16th-century bell tower is one of the features of the Winschoten skyline.

There is a Roman Catholic church dedicated to Saint Vitus, built by Alfred Tepe in 1880. It is a neo-gothic church with stained glass windows by Kocken and a sandstone high altar from Freitag in Münster. This altar was formerly placed in the Saint Boniface church in Nieuwe Pekela. When this church was demolished it was brought to Winschoten to replace an old altar.

There used to be a thriving Jewish community. During the Second World War, Winschoten was a transit port to Germany for the Jew-transports. Of the 493 Jews that lived in Winschoten at the beginning of the war, only 20 survived.

==Monuments==
The name &quot;tellerlikker&quot; (mentioned above) was given on account of the local custom to voraciously devour their meals and conclude with licking the plate (&quot;teller&quot; - in the local dialect) clean. A monument to one of these plate lickers stands on the Oldambt Square, in front of an area where the theatre &#x27;De Klinker&#x27;, built on the site of a former brick factory, used to be. A dog in turn licks the feet of his greedy owner.

==Language==
The official language is Dutch, but many Winschoters especially of older generations speak the local dialect called Gronings. In addition, many inhabitants are able to speak German or English. The Winschoter version of the dialect Gronings has influences of Hebrew and Yiddish as a consequence of the once prominent Jewish community that had lived there since the 18th century.

==Sports==
Winschoten is host to the oldest Ultramarathon of the Netherlands since 1976 called &quot;De RUN&quot;. It is a race of run individually over a paved lap through the town. The current record of 06:16:41 is held by Jean-Paul Praet since 1992. During the event, that is usually held on the second Saturday of September, there is also the possibility to run a race or to compete with a group in a 10x10 km relay race.

Winschoten also hosted the start and finish of the first stage at the 2013 Energiewacht Tour.
== Transportation ==
Winschoten has a railway station with train services towards Groningen and Leer (in Germany). The railway station was inaugurated 1 May 1868 to service the Groningen–Winschoten–Nieuweschans line. This was the second brought into use by the Company for the Exploitation of State Railways (Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen) and part of the Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway (built 1863–1868). Today this route is operated by Arriva.

Winschoten also has a road connection to the rest of the Netherlands and Germany via the A7 motorway (E22).

<text>Winsum (; ) is a town and a former municipality in the northeastern Netherlands. On 1 January 2019 the municipality merged with the municipalities of Bedum, De Marne and Eemsmond to form the new municipality Het Hogeland.

The town of Winsum was officially established in 1057 as the fusion of three historic villages: Obergum (North), Winsum (center) and Bellingeweer (South). The majority of the town&#x27;s 8,000 inhabitants commute to the nearby city Groningen.

The town boasts two traditional Dutch wind mills, two historic churches, two canals, and one of the Netherlands&#x27; oldest taverns. The two mills, &quot;De Ster&quot; (&quot;The Star&quot;) and &quot;De Vriendschap&quot; (&quot;The Friendship&quot;) were built in 1851 and 1801 respectively. The building that the tavern &quot;De Gouden Karper&quot; (&quot;The Golden Carp&quot;) now occupies has been in use as a tavern since the 16th century, and is the oldest (unverified) in the Netherlands.

<text>The optical microscope, also referred to as a light microscope, is a type of microscope that commonly uses visible light and a system of lenses to generate magnified images of small objects. Optical microscopes are the oldest design of microscope and were possibly invented in their present compound form in the 17th century. Basic optical microscopes can be very simple, although many complex designs aim to improve resolution and sample contrast.

The object is placed on a stage and may be directly viewed through one or two eyepieces on the microscope. In high-power microscopes, both eyepieces typically show the same image, but with a stereo microscope, slightly different images are used to create a 3-D effect. A camera is typically used to capture the image (micrograph).

The sample can be lit in a variety of ways. Transparent objects can be lit from below and solid objects can be lit with light coming through (bright field) or around (dark field) the objective lens. Polarised light may be used to determine crystal orientation of metallic objects. Phase-contrast imaging can be used to increase image contrast by highlighting small details of differing refractive index.

A range of objective lenses with different magnification are usually provided mounted on a turret, allowing them to be rotated into place and providing an ability to zoom-in. The maximum magnification power of optical microscopes is typically limited to around 1000x because of the limited resolving power of visible light. While larger magnifications are possible no additional details of the object are resolved.

Alternatives to optical microscopy which do not use visible light include scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy and as a result, can achieve much greater magnifications.

==Types==

There are two basic types of optical microscopes: simple microscopes and compound microscopes. A simple microscope uses the optical power of a single lens or group of lenses for magnification. A compound microscope uses a system of lenses (one set enlarging the image produced by another) to achieve a much higher magnification of an object. The vast majority of modern research microscopes are compound microscopes, while some cheaper commercial digital microscopes are simple single-lens microscopes. Compound microscopes can be further divided into a variety of other types of microscopes, which differ in their optical configurations, cost, and intended purposes.

===Simple microscope===
A simple microscope uses a lens or set of lenses to enlarge an object through angular magnification alone, giving the viewer an erect enlarged virtual image. The use of a single convex lens or groups of lenses are found in simple magnification devices such as the magnifying glass, loupes, and eyepieces for telescopes and microscopes.

===Compound microscope===

A compound microscope uses a lens close to the object being viewed to collect light (called the objective lens), which focuses a real image of the object inside the microscope (image 1). That image is then magnified by a second lens or group of lenses (called the eyepiece) that gives the viewer an enlarged inverted virtual image of the object (image 2). The use of a compound objective/eyepiece combination allows for much higher magnification. Common compound microscopes often feature exchangeable objective lenses, allowing the user to quickly adjust the magnification. A compound microscope also enables more advanced illumination setups, such as phase contrast.

===Other microscope variants===
There are many variants of the compound optical microscope design for specialized purposes. Some of these are physical design differences allowing specialization for certain purposes:
* Stereo microscope, a low-powered microscope which provides a stereoscopic view of the sample, commonly used for dissection.
* Comparison microscope has two separate light paths allowing direct comparison of two samples via one image in each eye.
* Inverted microscope, for studying samples from below; useful for cell cultures in liquid or for metallography.
* Fiber optic connector inspection microscope, designed for connector end-face inspection
* Traveling microscope, for studying samples of high optical resolution.

Other microscope variants are designed for different illumination techniques:
* Petrographic microscope, whose design usually includes a polarizing filter, rotating stage, and gypsum plate to facilitate the study of minerals or other crystalline materials whose optical properties can vary with orientation.
* Polarizing microscope, similar to the petrographic microscope.
* Phase-contrast microscope, which applies the phase contrast illumination method.
* Epifluorescence microscope, designed for analysis of samples that include fluorophores.
* Confocal microscope, a widely used variant of epifluorescent illumination that uses a scanning laser to illuminate a sample for fluorescence.
* Two-photon microscope, used to image fluorescence deeper in scattering media and reduce photobleaching, especially in living samples.
* Student microscope – an often low-power microscope with simplified controls and sometimes low-quality optics designed for school use or as a starter instrument for children.
* Ultramicroscope, an adapted light microscope that uses light scattering to allow viewing of tiny particles whose diameter is below or near the wavelength of visible light (around 500 nanometers); mostly obsolete since the advent of electron microscopes
* Tip-enhanced Raman microscope, is a variant of optical microscope based on tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, without traditional wavelength-based resolution limits. This microscope primarily realized on the scanning-probe microscope platforms using all optical tools.

===Digital microscope===
A digital microscope is a microscope equipped with a digital camera allowing observation of a sample via a computer. Microscopes can also be partly or wholly computer-controlled with various levels of automation. Digital microscopy allows greater analysis of a microscope image, for example, measurements of distances and areas and quantitation of a fluorescent or histological stain.

Low-powered digital microscopes, USB microscopes, are also commercially available. These are essentially webcams with a high-powered macro lens and generally do not use transillumination. The camera is attached directly to a computer&#x27;s USB port to show the images directly on the monitor. They offer modest magnifications (up to about 200×) without the need to use eyepieces and at a very low cost. High-power illumination is usually provided by an LED source or sources adjacent to the camera lens.

Digital microscopy with very low light levels to avoid damage to vulnerable biological samples is available using sensitive photon-counting digital cameras. It has been demonstrated that a light source providing pairs of entangled photons may minimize the risk of damage to the most light-sensitive samples. In this application of ghost imaging to photon-sparse microscopy, the sample is illuminated with infrared photons, each spatially correlated with an entangled partner in the visible band for efficient imaging by a photon-counting camera.

==History==
===Invention===
The earliest microscopes were single lens magnifying glasses with limited magnification, which date at least as far back as the widespread use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century.

Compound microscopes first appeared in Europe around 1620 including one demonstrated by Cornelis Drebbel in London (around 1621) and one exhibited in Rome in 1624.

The actual inventor of the compound microscope is unknown although many claims have been made over the years. These include a claim 35 years after they appeared by Dutch spectacle-maker Johannes Zachariassen that his father, Zacharias Janssen, invented the compound microscope and/or the telescope as early as 1590. Johannes&#x27; testimony, which some claim is dubious, pushes the invention date so far back that Zacharias would have been a child at the time, leading to speculation that, for Johannes&#x27; claim to be true, the compound microscope would have to have been invented by Johannes&#x27; grandfather, Hans Martens. Another claim is that Janssen&#x27;s competitor, Hans Lippershey (who applied for the first telescope patent in 1608) also invented the compound microscope. Other historians point to the Dutch innovator Cornelis Drebbel with his 1621 compound microscope.

Galileo Galilei is sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor. After 1610, he found that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects, such as flies, close up and/or could look through the wrong end in reverse to magnify small objects. The only drawback was that his 2 foot long telescope had to be extended out to 6 feet to view objects that close. After seeing the compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, Galileo built his own improved version. In 1625, Giovanni Faber coined the name &quot;microscope&quot; for the compound microscope Galileo submitted to the in 1624 (Galileo had called it the &quot;&quot;occhiolino&quot; or &quot;little eye&quot;&quot;). Faber coined the name from the Greek words &quot;μικρόν&quot; (micron) meaning &quot;small&quot;, and &quot;σκοπεῖν&quot; (skopein) meaning &quot;to look at&quot;, a name meant to be analogous with &quot;telescope&quot;, another word coined by the Linceans.

Christiaan Huygens, another Dutchman, developed a simple 2-lens ocular system in the late 17th century that was achromatically corrected, and therefore a huge step forward in microscope development. The Huygens ocular is still being produced to this day, but suffers from a small field size, and other minor disadvantages.

===Popularization===

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1724) is credited with bringing the microscope to the attention of biologists, even though simple magnifying lenses were already being produced in the 16th century. Van Leeuwenhoek&#x27;s home-made microscopes were simple microscopes, with a single very small, yet strong lens. They were awkward in use, but enabled van Leeuwenhoek to see detailed images. It took about 150 years of optical development before the compound microscope was able to provide the same quality image as van Leeuwenhoek&#x27;s simple microscopes, due to difficulties in configuring multiple lenses. In the 1850s, John Leonard Riddell, Professor of Chemistry at Tulane University, invented the first practical binocular microscope while carrying out one of the earliest and most extensive American microscopic investigations of cholera.

===Lighting techniques===
While basic microscope technology and optics have been available for over 400 years it is much more recently that techniques in sample illumination were developed to generate the high quality images seen today.

In August 1893, August Köhler developed Köhler illumination. This method of sample illumination gives rise to extremely even lighting and overcomes many limitations of older techniques of sample illumination. Before development of Köhler illumination the image of the light source, for example a lightbulb filament, was always visible in the image of the sample.

The Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in 1953 for his development of phase contrast illumination which allows imaging of transparent samples. By using interference rather than absorption of light, extremely transparent samples, such as live mammalian cells, can be imaged without having to use staining techniques. Just two years later, in 1955, Georges Nomarski published the theory for differential interference contrast microscopy, another interference-based imaging technique.

===Fluorescence microscopy===
Modern biological microscopy depends heavily on the development of fluorescent probes for specific structures within a cell. In contrast to normal transilluminated light microscopy, in fluorescence microscopy the sample is illuminated through the objective lens with a narrow set of wavelengths of light. This light interacts with fluorophores in the sample which then emit light of a longer wavelength. It is this emitted light which makes up the image.

Since the mid-20th century chemical fluorescent stains, such as DAPI which binds to DNA, have been used to label specific structures within the cell. More recent developments include immunofluorescence, which uses fluorescently labelled antibodies to recognise specific proteins within a sample, and fluorescent proteins like GFP which a live cell can express making it fluorescent.

==Components==
All modern optical microscopes designed for viewing samples by transmitted light share the same basic components of the light path. In addition, the vast majority of microscopes have the same &#x27;structural&#x27; components (numbered below according to the image on the right):
* Eyepiece (ocular lens) (1)
* Objective turret, revolver, or revolving nose piece (to hold multiple objective lenses) (2)
* Objective lenses (3)
* Focus knobs (to move the stage)
** Coarse adjustment (4)
** Fine adjustment (5)
* Stage (to hold the specimen) (6)
* Light source (a light or a mirror) (7)
* Diaphragm and condenser (8)
* Mechanical stage (9)

===Eyepiece (ocular lens)===
The eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a cylinder containing two or more lenses; its function is to bring the image into focus for the eye. The eyepiece is inserted into the top end of the body tube. Eyepieces are interchangeable and many different eyepieces can be inserted with different degrees of magnification. Typical magnification values for eyepieces include 5×, 10× (the most common), 15× and 20×. In some high performance microscopes, the optical configuration of the objective lens and eyepiece are matched to give the best possible optical performance. This occurs most commonly with apochromatic objectives.

===Objective turret (revolver or revolving nose piece)===
Objective turret, revolver, or revolving nose piece is the part that holds the set of objective lenses. It allows the user to switch between objective lenses.

===Objective lens===
At the lower end of a typical compound optical microscope, there are one or more objective lenses that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a cylinder housing containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three objective lenses screwed into a circular nose piece which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5× to 100× while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2 mm, respectively. Objective lenses with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image. Some high performance objective lenses may require matched eyepieces to deliver the best optical performance.

====Oil immersion objective====

Some microscopes make use of oil-immersion objectives or water-immersion objectives for greater resolution at high magnification. These are used with index-matching material such as immersion oil or water and a matched cover slip between the objective lens and the sample. The refractive index of the index-matching material is higher than air allowing the objective lens to have a larger numerical aperture (greater than 1) so that the light is transmitted from the specimen to the outer face of the objective lens with minimal refraction. Numerical apertures as high as 1.6 can be achieved. The larger numerical aperture allows collection of more light making detailed observation of smaller details possible. An oil immersion lens usually has a magnification of 40 to 100×.

===Focus knobs===
Adjustment knobs move the stage up and down with separate adjustment for coarse and fine focusing. The same controls enable the microscope to adjust to specimens of different thickness. In older designs of microscopes, the focus adjustment wheels move the microscope tube up or down relative to the stand and had a fixed stage.

===Frame===
The whole of the optical assembly is traditionally attached to a rigid arm, which in turn is attached to a robust U-shaped foot to provide the necessary rigidity. The arm angle may be adjustable to allow the viewing angle to be adjusted.

The frame provides a mounting point for various microscope controls. Normally this will include controls for focusing, typically a large knurled wheel to adjust coarse focus, together with a smaller knurled wheel to control fine focus. Other features may be lamp controls and/or controls for adjusting the condenser.

===Stage===
The stage is a platform below the objective lens which supports the specimen being viewed. In the center of the stage is a hole through which light passes to illuminate the specimen. The stage usually has arms to hold slides (rectangular glass plates with typical dimensions of 25×75 mm, on which the specimen is mounted).

At magnifications higher than 100× moving a slide by hand is not practical. A mechanical stage, typical of medium and higher priced microscopes, allows tiny movements of the slide via control knobs that reposition the sample/slide as desired. If a microscope did not originally have a mechanical stage it may be possible to add one.

All stages move up and down for focus. With a mechanical stage slides move on two horizontal axes for positioning the specimen to examine specimen details.

Focusing starts at lower magnification in order to center the specimen by the user on the stage. Moving to a higher magnification requires the stage to be moved higher vertically for re-focus at the higher magnification and may also require slight horizontal specimen position adjustment. Horizontal specimen position adjustments are the reason for having a mechanical stage.

Due to the difficulty in preparing specimens and mounting them on slides, for children it is best to begin with prepared slides that are centered and focus easily regardless of the focus level used.

===Light source===
Many sources of light can be used. At its simplest, daylight is directed via a mirror. Most microscopes, however, have their own adjustable and controllable light source – often a halogen lamp, although illumination using LEDs and lasers are becoming a more common provision. Köhler illumination is often provided on more expensive instruments.

===Condenser===
The condenser is a lens designed to focus light from the illumination source onto the sample. The condenser may also include other features, such as a diaphragm and/or filters, to manage the quality and intensity of the illumination. For illumination techniques like dark field, phase contrast and differential interference contrast microscopy additional optical components must be precisely aligned in the light path.

===Magnification===
The actual power or magnification of a compound optical microscope is the product of the powers of the eyepiece and the objective lens. For example a 10x eyepiece magnification and a 100x objective lens magnification gives a total magnification of 1,000×. Modified environments such as the use of oil or ultraviolet light can increase the resolution and allow for resolved details at magnifications larger than 1,000x.

==Operation==
===Illumination techniques===

Many techniques are available which modify the light path to generate an improved contrast image from a sample. Major techniques for generating increased contrast from the sample include cross-polarized light, dark field, phase contrast and differential interference contrast illumination. A recent technique (Sarfus) combines cross-polarized light and specific contrast-enhanced slides for the visualization of nanometric samples.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Other techniques===
Modern microscopes allow more than just observation of transmitted light image of a sample; there are many techniques which can be used to extract other kinds of data. Most of these require additional equipment in addition to a basic compound microscope.
* Reflected light, or incident, illumination (for analysis of surface structures)
* Fluorescence microscopy, both:
:*Epifluorescence microscopy
:*Confocal microscopy
* Microspectroscopy (where a UV-visible spectrophotometer is integrated with an optical microscope)
* Ultraviolet microscopy
* Near-Infrared microscopy
* Multiple transmission microscopy for contrast enhancement and aberration reduction.
* Automation (for automatic scanning of a large sample or image capture)

==Applications==

Optical microscopy is used extensively in microelectronics, nanophysics, biotechnology, pharmaceutic research, mineralogy and microbiology.

Optical microscopy is used for medical diagnosis, the field being termed histopathology when dealing with tissues, or in smear tests on free cells or tissue fragments.

In industrial use, binocular microscopes are common. Aside from applications needing true depth perception, the use of dual eyepieces reduces eye strain associated with long workdays at a microscopy station. In certain applications, long-working-distance or long-focus microscopes are beneficial. An item may need to be examined behind a window, or industrial subjects may be a hazard to the objective. Such optics resemble telescopes with close-focus capabilities.

Measuring microscopes are used for precision measurement. There are two basic types.
One has a reticle graduated to allow measuring distances in the focal plane. The other (and older) type has simple crosshairs and a micrometer mechanism for moving the subject relative to the microscope.

Very small, portable microscopes have found some usage in places where a laboratory microscope would be a burden.

==Limitations==

At very high magnifications with transmitted light, point objects are seen as fuzzy discs surrounded by diffraction rings. These are called Airy disks. The &quot;resolving power&quot; of a microscope is taken as the ability to distinguish between two closely spaced Airy disks (or, in other words the ability of the microscope to reveal adjacent structural detail as distinct and separate). It is these impacts of diffraction that limit the ability to resolve fine details. The extent and magnitude of the diffraction patterns are affected by both the wavelength of light (λ), the refractive materials used to manufacture the objective lens and the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective lens. There is therefore a finite limit beyond which it is impossible to resolve separate points in the objective field, known as the diffraction limit. Assuming that optical aberrations in the whole optical set-up are negligible, the resolution &quot;d&quot;, can be stated as:

:formula_1

Usually a wavelength of 550 nm is assumed, which corresponds to green light. With air as the external medium, the highest practical &quot;NA&quot; is 0.95, and with oil, up to 1.5. In practice the lowest value of &quot;d&quot; obtainable with conventional lenses is about 200 nm. A new type of lens using multiple scattering of light allowed to improve the resolution to below 100 nm.

===Surpassing the resolution limit===
Multiple techniques are available for reaching resolutions higher than the transmitted light limit described above. Holographic techniques, as described by Courjon and Bulabois in 1979, are also capable of breaking this resolution limit, although resolution was restricted in their experimental analysis.

Using fluorescent samples more techniques are available. Examples include Vertico SMI, near field scanning optical microscopy which uses evanescent waves, and stimulated emission depletion. In 2005, a microscope capable of detecting a single molecule was described as a teaching tool.

Despite significant progress in the last decade, techniques for surpassing the diffraction limit remain limited and specialized.

While most techniques focus on increases in lateral resolution there are also some techniques which aim to allow analysis of extremely thin samples. For example, sarfus methods place the thin sample on a contrast-enhancing surface and thereby allows to directly visualize films as thin as 0.3 nanometers.

On 8 October 2014, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Eric Betzig, William Moerner and Stefan Hell for the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy.

====Structured illumination SMI====
SMI (spatially modulated illumination microscopy) is a light optical process of the so-called point spread function (PSF) engineering. These are processes which modify the PSF of a microscope in a suitable manner to either increase the optical resolution, to maximize the precision of distance measurements of fluorescent objects that are small relative to the wavelength of the illuminating light, or to extract other structural parameters in the nanometer range.

====Localization microscopy SPDMphymod====

SPDM (spectral precision distance microscopy), the basic localization microscopy technology is a light optical process of fluorescence microscopy which allows position, distance and angle measurements on &quot;optically isolated&quot; particles (e.g. molecules) well below the theoretical limit of resolution for light microscopy. &quot;Optically isolated&quot; means that at a given point in time, only a single particle/molecule within a region of a size determined by conventional optical resolution (typically approx. 200–250 nm diameter) is being registered. This is possible when molecules within such a region all carry different spectral markers (e.g. different colors or other usable differences in the light emission of different particles).

Many standard fluorescent dyes like GFP, Alexa dyes, Atto dyes, Cy2/Cy3 and fluorescein molecules can be used for localization microscopy, provided certain photo-physical conditions are present. Using this so-called SPDMphymod (physically modifiable fluorophores) technology a single laser wavelength of suitable intensity is sufficient for nanoimaging.

====3D super resolution microscopy====
3D super resolution microscopy with standard fluorescent dyes can be achieved by combination of localization microscopy for standard fluorescent dyes SPDMphymod and structured illumination SMI.

====STED====

Stimulated emission depletion is a simple example of how higher resolution surpassing the diffraction limit is possible, but it has major limitations. STED is a fluorescence microscopy technique which uses a combination of light pulses to induce fluorescence in a small sub-population of fluorescent molecules in a sample. Each molecule produces a diffraction-limited spot of light in the image, and the centre of each of these spots corresponds to the location of the molecule. As the number of fluorescing molecules is low the spots of light are unlikely to overlap and therefore can be placed accurately. This process is then repeated many times to generate the image. Stefan Hell of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry was awarded the 10th German Future Prize in 2006 and Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2014 for his development of the STED microscope and associated methodologies.

==Alternatives==
In order to overcome the limitations set by the diffraction limit of visible light other microscopes have been designed which use other waves.
* Atomic force microscope (AFM)
* Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
* Scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM)
* Scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
* Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
* Ultraviolet microscope
* X-ray microscope

It is important to note that higher frequency waves have limited interaction with matter, for example soft tissues are relatively transparent to X-rays resulting in distinct sources of contrast and different target applications.

The use of electrons and X-rays in place of light allows much higher resolution – the wavelength of the radiation is shorter so the diffraction limit is lower. To make the
short-wavelength probe non-destructive, the atomic beam imaging system (atomic nanoscope) has been proposed and widely discussed in the literature, but it is not yet competitive with conventional imaging systems.

STM and AFM are scanning probe techniques using a small probe which is scanned over the sample surface. Resolution in these cases is limited by the size of the probe; micromachining techniques can produce probes with tip radii of 5–10 nm.

Additionally, methods such as electron or X-ray microscopy use a vacuum or partial vacuum, which limits their use for live and biological samples (with the exception of an environmental scanning electron microscope). The specimen chambers needed for all such instruments also limits sample size, and sample manipulation is more difficult. Color cannot be seen in images made by these methods, so some information is lost. They are however, essential when investigating molecular or atomic effects, such as age hardening in aluminium alloys, or the microstructure of polymers.

<text>Green Lake Township is a civil township of Grand Traverse County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 6,703 at the 2020 census, an increase from 5,784 at the 2010 census. The township is named after Green Lake, one of two large lakes in the township (the other being Duck Lake).

The township is the home of Interlochen Center for the Arts, an arts boarding school. Interlochen State Park is also within the township.

== History ==
Green Lake Township was organized in 1883, from part of Blair Township. This makes it the newest township in Grand Traverse County.

Interlochen Center for the Arts was established in Green Lake Township in 1928 by Joseph E. Maddy.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (19.10%) is water. The township is located in the west of Grand Traverse County, sharing a boundary with Benzie County.

Green Lake Township&#x27;s most notable features are the two large lakes within its borders, Green Lake and Duck Lake. Interlochen Center for the Arts and Interlochen State Park are located on the isthmus between these two lakes. Additionally, a small portion of Long Lake extends into Green Lake Township from the north. The headwaters of the Platte River at Long Lake are within the township.

The Green Lake Airport is a small, unpaved airport located in the south of the township.

<text>Long Lake Township, officially the Charter Township of Long Lake, is a charter township of Grand Traverse County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 9,956 at the 2020 census, an increase from 8,662 at the 2010 census.

Long Lake Township is one of three charter townships in Grand Traverse County, the others being East Bay Township and neighboring Garfield Township. Long Lake, from which the township takes its name, is the largest lake entirely within Grand Traverse County. Much of Long Lake Township is suburban due to its proximity to Traverse City.

==History==
The Long Lake township area was initially settled in 1862 when Ira Chase and his brother-in-law Eliphalet Fillmore traveled from Whitewater township to Grand Traverse County to select land. The next few years saw the gradual influx of families who cleared forested areas to establish farms. An annual cycle of farming in the summer, logging in the winter, and maple sugaring in the spring began. The end of the Civil War brought additional settlers and in November 1866 a group of men petitioned the Board of Supervisors of Grand Traverse County to form &quot;Viola Township&quot; from Township 27 north, Range 12 west, of old Traverse Township. In January 1867, Long Lake Township was formally organized.

The population of the township was 333 in 1870, rising to 434 in 1880. The most notable historical incident in the early 1870s was the probable murder of John Eley, his wife Philopena, and their two daughters in July 1871. The family disappeared and neighbors later discovered blood on the walls of the family&#x27;s house. A hired hand, William Benton, was the prime suspect, since he claimed to have been sold the Eleys&#x27; farm. The case was never solved.

In the late 1870s, members of the Society of Friends (Quakers) began to move to the township from Indiana. A smaller number of people from Bohemia also settled in the area. The township&#x27;s population was 663 persons in 152 households in 1900.

Farming continued to be the primary source of income. The rise of the auto industry in the late 1910s to 1920s led many younger people to leave the area to settle in the Detroit and Flint areas of Michigan. Today, many residents of Long Lake township are retirees or commute to work in Traverse City.

Long Lake Township converted from a civil township to a charter township in 2022.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (15.52%) is water.

The most defining feature of the township is the eponymous Long Lake. Most of the lake is within the township, although a small portion extends south into Green Lake Township. The lake drains through the Platte River to Lake Michigan. The second largest lake in the township is Bass Lake, which is also shared to the south with Green Lake Township.

Long Lake Township lies within miles of both Traverse City and Lake Ann. Much of Long Lake Township is suburbanized because of the township&#x27;s proximity to Traverse City.

<text>Peninsula Township is a civil township of Grand Traverse County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The township had a population of 6,068 at the 2020 census, an increase from 5,433 at the 2010 census.

Peninsula Township is coterminous with the Old Mission Peninsula, which projects about north from its base in Traverse City into Grand Traverse Bay, an arm of Lake Michigan. The peninsula divides the Grand Traverse Bay into an East Arm and West Arm. The peninsula is well known for its cherry harvest and viticulture, and is included in the Old Mission Peninsula AVA, a federally recognized viticultural region. At the northern tip of the peninsula is Mission Point Light, which lies just south of the 45th parallel north.

Also included within Peninsula Township is Power Island, a small island in the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay.

== History ==
The settlement at Old Mission was the first community founded by Europeans in the Grand Traverse Bay region, as a duty of the federal government under the Treaty of Washington (1836). It was founded in May 1839 by Rev. Peter Dougherty and Rev. John Fleming. They had spent the winter on Mackinac Island, and founded a Presbyterian mission at the small Old Mission Harbor, which of course did not yet have that name. The location is a convenient and strategic location along canoe routes between native settlements in the Grand Traverse Bay region. At the time of their arrival there were a few Native American residents of what appeared to be a nearly abandoned village at the harbor. These natives made smoke signals over their watch fire to summon a substantial number of men of the tribe to canoe across the bay to join the visitors for a multi-day parlay. The mission had peaceful relations with native residents in the surrounding area. The settlement was originally known as Grand Traverse.

In June 1839 Henry Schoolcraft arrived at the mission in a small vessel and helped found a school there. By 1841 a seasonal village that was important for sheltering tribal members during trading expeditions, hunts, fishing endeavors, and gathering nearby wild rice had grown to a permanent village, with 5 log buildings as well as several wigwams at the settlement. By 1850 the settlement had grown to a considerable size, and the schooner Arrow was making weekly trips to the mission from Mackinaw City.

In 1851, a post office was established in Grand Traverse, with W.R. Stone as first postmaster. This was the only official post office in the Grand Traverse Bay region, indeed the only one between Mackinaw City and Croton. In 1852, Rev. Dougherty decided to move his mission across the west bay along the Leelanau Peninsula to an existing Native American village at the site of modern Omena, thus establishing a &quot;New Mission.&quot; The previous community was nicknamed as the &quot;Old Mission&quot; in the early 1850s. By the time of the civil war, the Presbyterian organization which funded Dougherty had financial difficulty, and missionary activities were discontinued. Dougherty sold his land there in 1868.

In 1852, the U.S. Postal Service, in consultation with Albert Tracy Lay, a founding father of Traverse City, decided to rename the post office at Grand Traverse to &quot;Old Mission&quot; and named the post office at the Boardman River from &quot;Grand Traverse City&quot; to &quot;Traverse City&quot;, as the former was too long a name per post office guidelines.

In 1853, Peninsula Township was organized as one of Grand Traverse County&#x27;s first two townships, the other being Traverse Township (taking up all of mainland Grand Traverse County, excluding the Old Mission Peninsula).

Beginning in the early 1940s, the Michigan State Highway Department (now MDOT) constructed Center Road to allow for easier access up the peninsula, with motorists previously having to remain on narrow and winding shoreline roads. Center Road is today the northernmost leg of state trunkline highway M-37.

== Geography ==
Peninsula Township contains the landmass known as the Old Mission Peninsula, and Power Island. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 31.8 square miles (82.5 km), of which 27.9 square miles (72.2 km) is land and 4.0 square miles (10.3 km) (13%) is water.

=== Old Mission Peninsula ===
The Old Mission Peninsula extends about from the Lower Peninsula of Michigan into Grand Traverse Bay, itself a bay of Lake Michigan. The peninsula separates Grand Traverse Bay into its West Arm and East Arm. Additionally, the peninsula is adjacent to Bowers Harbor and Old Mission Harbor, smaller inlets of the West Arm and East Arm, respectively. At its widest, the peninsula is only about 3.25 miles shore-to-shore (5.23 kilometers). Unlike the rest of mainland Grand Traverse County, the Old Mission Peninsula, like the neighboring Leelanau Peninsula, has unusually steep and rising terrain for the region. The northern end of the peninsula, however, is much flatter than the rest, and is a part of the Antrim–Charlevoix Drumlin Field.

=== Major highway ===

* (historically known as Center Road) runs for along the backbone of the peninsula, terminating in a cul-de-sac at Old Mission Point. It was designated what is now known as a Pure Michigan Byway Scenic Route in June 2007. The M-37 Scenic Heritage Route proposal is itself a unique resource concerning the character of the peninsula, and the activities along this byway. South of the peninsula, in Traverse City, M-37 intersects highways US 31 and M-72.

== Communities ==

*Archie, a ghost town on the shore of East Grand Traverse Bay, at . Archie was given a post office in 1885, which lasted until September 1900. The post office reopened the following December, but was closed again in 1902.
*Mapleton is an unincorporated community roughly midway up the Old Mission Peninsula, along M-37 at . Mapleton was founded in 1859 by the Ogden family of New York state, with a post office opening the same year. The post office lasted until 1904. Today, despite being a small community, Mapleton is marked by signage along M-37.
*Neahtawanta is a historic summer resort colony at . The word &quot;Neahtawanta&quot; derives from Ojibwe words meaning &quot;placid waters&quot;, in reference to Bowers Harbor. Neahtawanta was established in 1890 by the Neahtawanta Association, and a post office was established in 1907, only lasting until 1914. Today, Neahtawanta is still occupied by large summer resort homes, and the Neahtawanta Inn remains open.
*Ogdensburg, a ghost town at . Ogdensburg was founded by the same Ogden family in 1855, and was one of the region&#x27;s first settlements. Today, all that remains is a cemetery.
*Old Mission is an unincorporated community in the township near the end of the peninsula on the east arm of the bay at .
*Traverse City is immediately adjacent Peninsula Township, bordering it to the south. Much of the south of Peninsula Township has suburbanized due to its proximity to Traverse City. Traverse City, though, is politically independent of Peninsula Township, and the two are administered separately.

== Recreation ==
*The &quot;Old Mission Peninsula Cruise&quot; is considered to be a &quot;serendipitous&quot; adventure for road bike riders. It is favored by local riders, including bicycle clubs, because of the scenery, the quality of the road, and lack of traffic.
*The peninsula is a great place to sea kayak. The bay offers a shelter from the prevailing westerly winds and from the Lake Michigan waves. One can get close to shore, the lighthouse, picnic grounds and parks. Maps, rentals and guided tours are available.
*There are many recurrent and special events. A calendar is available.
== Produce ==

=== Wineries ===
There are eleven wineries on the Old Mission Peninsula. The Old Mission Peninsula sits close to the 45th parallel, a latitude known for growing prestigious grapes. The two Grand Traverse Bays provide the ideal maritime climate and the rich soil does the rest. Northern Michigan specializes in growing white grapes and is known for its Rieslings which grow well in the summer months and late fall which Traverse City is known for. Every October the wineries host a harvest fest. Some Riesling grapes are spared being picked in the fall to be picked when they freeze, from which Ice Wine is made.

<text>St. Louis is a city in Gratiot County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2010 census the population was 7,482.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

It was long recognized that St. Louis sits at the geographic center of Michigan&#x27;s lower peninsula &quot;as closely as can be determined.&quot; A campaign by Clarence and Odessa Smazel in the early 1950s, owners of the &quot;St. Louis Leader-Press&quot;, a now-defunct local newspaper, resulted in the State of Michigan designating it as such: a sign in Clapp Park on Highway M-46 denotes the city as the official &quot;Middle of the Mitten.&quot;

==History==
Indigenous people lived in this area for thousands of years before European contact. The French were early explorers in present-day Michigan. They established fur trading with the historic First Nations and Native American nations. By the 18th century, the &quot;Ojibwe&quot; were the dominant tribe in present-day Michigan. After the Seven Years&#x27; War, France was forced to cede its New France territory to the victorious English, who increased fur trade at Sault Ste. Marie. After the rebellious colonists&#x27; victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory changed hands again, being ceded to the new United States.

It was not until the mid-19th century that much European-American settlement reached this area. In 1848 missionaries established the Bethany Lutheran Mission to serve local American Indians, mostly Anishinaabe-speaking &quot;Ojibwe&quot; (also known in the US as &quot;Chippewa&quot;). Following a Native American path to the mission, the European-American Joseph W. Clapp came to the area in 1853, where he built the first house of present-day St. Louis. Over 150 years later, the Mission still stands near Main Street Bridge across the Pine River.

By the late nineteenth century, the discovery of mineral springs made St. Louis a destination for people seeking the health benefits of local mineral-rich water, which had the added feature of magnetizing steel. Famous guests who credited the water with cures included detective Allan Pinkerton and Civil War general &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Hooker. The Park Hotel became noted as a health spa, and for its duck dinners as well.

St. Louis is the site of the former Michigan Chemical Corporation plant, which helped market and produce DDT as a widely commercial product. After its purchase by Velsicol Chemical Corporation, the plant was responsible for a product mixup in the 1970s. This resulted in contamination of cattle feed with PBB, a flame retardant. The feed was distributed throughout Michigan and the Midwest. The mixup occurred due what was described as a &quot;triple witching hour&quot; of events: a labor strike with management&#x27;s replacing regular workers; a shortage of bags that helped distinguish between cattle feed additive and the flame-retardant PBB; and storing both the cattle feed and the fire retardant in the same dimly lit warehouse.

Dredging has been underway for years to remove contaminants from the Pine River, which runs alongside the property where the plant was located. Although the plant was disassembled years ago, the land remains vacant to this day.

St. Louis has gained some jobs by inviting the State of Michigan to build a minimum-security prison between Union and Croswell Roads (Pine River Correctional Facility), on the former Reichard &quot;Rainbow Trail&quot; hatchery property.

It was long occupied by the Potowatomi, an Algonquian-speaking people who were part of a long-term alliance, called the Council of Three Fires, with the Ojibwe and Odawa (Ottawa). A Potowatomi band of about 150 people, led by the chief known as Baw Beese, had a base camp near the large lake in the area.

The first European-American settler, Jeremiah Arnold, arrived in 1834 and encountered the band. They helped the early settlers. Arnold erected a cabin and moved in with his wife Percy (Round) Arnold. With the arrival of other settlers, the pioneers erected the first schoolhouse in 1838. Hillsdale was platted in 1839. In 1840, the US forced out Baw Beese and his people, as well as other Potowatomi in neighboring and more distant areas of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, making them remove to Indian Territory in present-day Kansas.

Founded in 1844 as Central Michigan College in Spring Arbor, Hillsdale College relocated to this city in 1853 and changed its name. It was the first American college to prohibit in its charter discrimination based on race, religion or sex, and became an early force for the abolition of slavery. It was the second college in the nation to grant four-year liberal arts degrees to women.

The city was chartered in 1869. In 1885 Hillsdale dedicated its first high school building, on what is now West Street. (It is now used as the middle school.) In the late 1800s, Hillsdale became a booming railroad town, served by both freight and passenger trains.

The railroad was used by tourists to enjoy cottages and other facilities on Baw Beese Lake, named after the Potowatomi chief. About 20 minutes from downtown, the area was developed as a lake resort by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad. People could avoid dusty travel on unpaved roads by taking the train. At the turn of the 20th century, it began to attract tourists from a wider range of cities, such as Chicago, Toledo, Elkhart and others at what had been known as Archer&#x27;s Landing. People swam in the lake and could rent two types of canoes.

After World War II, the construction of interstate highways encouraged use of automobiles, and passenger traffic declined on many lines. Railroads had to restructure and the last passenger train left Hillsdale in 1956. Dozens of fine Victorian homes had been built during the prosperity of the 19th century, many of which are still occupied as private residences, contributing to the city&#x27;s historic fabric.

The 20th century brought additional improvements. In 1908 the city opened its first public library. In 1921 it opened its first hospital and in 1934 Hillsdale Municipal Airport opened.

The area has been defined by several political entities since 1906 beginning with the Burbank School District, and shortly afterward the Burbank Fire District, which expanded the community far beyond its traditional, political and unofficial boundaries. The Burbank Sanitary District and later the Burbank Community Advisory Council became identifying local political entities.

===Burbank Sanitary District===
The Burbank Sanitary District operates the sewer collection lines, handles waste collection and street sweeping. Established in 1940, the Sanitary District is the only local government, other than LBSD, specific to the neighborhood. The District is governed by a Board of five members, elected to four-year terms, which meets monthly. Legal and engineering services, as well as all construction and maintenance, are contracted out.

Sewer services are provided to other unincorporated areas of the Burbank Community by the West Valley Sanitation District, an independent sanitation district that also services neighboring cities and unincorporated areas. Waste collection in the other areas are the jurisdiction of the County of Santa Clara. Sewage treatment is provided by the San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant a joint powers agency of which both districts are members.

== Education ==
The only public school located in Burbank is Luther Burbank School, a K-8 elementary school located on San Carlos Street and Wabash. It is the only school operated by the Luther Burbank School District (LBSD). Founded in 1906, the District celebrated its centennial in 2006. Burbank-area students attend high schools in the Campbell Union High School District.

==Landmarks==
The second Burbank fire station, sold in the late 1970s, is on the northeast corner of Scott Street and Flagg Avenue. The unusually-high garage door is the only clue today that the residence was once a fire station. The fire district became part of Santa Clara County Fire Department, (a.k.a. Central Fire District,) about 1960 and is served by San Jose Fire Department under a contract.

The Burbank Theater is another local landmark supporting use of the name. It is no longer a working theater.

The Burbank Business Circle is the name of a unique San Jose owned roadway that runs through the parking lot of the shopping center on the southwest corner of Bascom Avenue and Stevens Creek Blvd.

<doc id="117606" wikidata="Q2185689" url="?curid=117606" title="Laurium, Michigan">
<text>Laurium (; or ) is a village in Calumet Township, Houghton County in the U.S. state of Michigan, in the center of the Keweenaw Peninsula. The population was 1,977 at the 2010 census.

The village is mostly surrounded by Calumet Township, with a small portion bordering Schoolcraft Township on the east.  The portion of Calumet Township south of Laurium is considered part of the Florida (or Florida Location) unincorporated community.

==History==

Until 1895, Laurium was known as &quot;Calumet&quot; (not to be confused with the present nearby town of Calumet, Michigan, which was known as &quot;Red Jacket&quot; until it adopted the name Calumet in 1929). In 1895 the legislature changed Calumet&#x27;s name to Laurium, after the famous mining town in ancient Greece. Laurium is located in the center of the Copper Country, the first major copper mining region in the United States. It was founded as a company town serving the Laurium copper mine, which later became part of the Calumet &amp; Hecla mine. The town was generally home to the wealthier members of Keweenaw society, such as mine owners and captains. Although the mines have long since closed, the town still sports many large houses and mansions built by the wealthy mine owners. Today, many of the houses are participating locations in the Keweenaw National Historical Park.

The population in 1900 was 5643, of whom 2286 were foreign-born.

Noted 20th-century football player George Gipp (&quot;the Gipper&quot;) was born in Laurium. A small memorial to the football legend is located on the corner of Lake Linden Avenue and Tamarack Street and his grave is in nearby Lake View Cemetery.

The Palestra was a noted hockey arena, built in Laurium in 1904. It is thought to have been the first purpose-built indoor hockey venue in the United States. In 1921, the entire arena was moved to Marquette, Michigan, and remained there until being razed in 1974.

==Laurium Historic District==


In 2005, the Laurium Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The district is roughly bounded by Calumet Street on the west and south, Stable Street on the north, and North Florida and Isle Royale Streets on the east. This area contains the entire village of Laurium save two areas added in the 1970s.

The vast majority of the structures in Laurium were constructed during the 35 years between 1880 and 1915, and the common architectural styles in the village reflect what was popular at the time.

Over 90% of the structures in the historic district are residential in nature, and most of those are single-family houses. Probably the grandest of these is the Thomas H. Hoatson House (now known as the Laurium Manor Inn), a large Classical Revival style house. The most common houses are more modest in scale and ornamentation, with two-story front-gabled houses of predominantly frame construction being the most common.

Five churches and two schools are spread through the community, and most commercial structures are near the intersection of Hecla and Third Streets; this includes the J. Vivian, Jr. and Company Building, which is separately listed on the National Register. These buildings are often constructed of brick and/or sandstone.

==History==
South Range was platted in 1902 by the Wheal Kate Mining Company, which operated an unsuccessful copper mine nearby. In 1906 the community tried to incorporate as the town of &quot;Stanton&quot;, but there was already a Stanton, Michigan, so they incorporated as &quot;South Range&quot;, because it was at the south end of the Michigan copper range. Italians were the dominant ethnic group in early years.

On December 11, 1913, during the bitter Copper Country Strike of 1913–1914, a raid was conducted by the Citizens&#x27; Alliance shortly after the mass murder at the Dally boardinghouse in Painesdale, Michigan which had occurred just a mere few days before. Thirty-seven rifles, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition was seized. Twenty-three strikers were arrested with guns ready to shoot up the area that night, and Deputy T. Driscoll was non-fatally shot in the arm during the raid.
