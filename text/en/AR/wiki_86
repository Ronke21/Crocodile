<text>SkyTrain is the medium-capacity rapid transit system serving the Metro Vancouver region in British Columbia, Canada. SkyTrain has of track and uses fully automated trains on grade-separated tracks running on underground and elevated guideways, allowing SkyTrain to hold consistently high on-time reliability. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

The name &quot;SkyTrain&quot; was coined for the system during Expo 86 because the first line (Expo) principally runs on elevated guideway outside of Downtown Vancouver, providing panoramic views of the metropolitan area. SkyTrain uses the world&#x27;s third-longest cable-supported transit-only bridge, known as SkyBridge, to cross the Fraser River.

With the opening of the Evergreen Extension on December 2, 2016, SkyTrain became the longest rapid transit system in Canada and the longest fully automated driverless system in the world. The total lengths of the automated lines of the Shanghai Metro, Singapore MRT, Kuala Lumpur Rapid KL and Dubai Metro have since surpassed those of SkyTrain.

SkyTrain has 54 stations served by three lines: the Expo Line, the Millennium Line, and the Canada Line. The Expo and Millennium Lines are operated by British Columbia Rapid Transit Company under contract from TransLink (originally BC Transit), a regional government transportation agency. The Canada Line is operated on the same principles by the private concessionaire ProTrans BC under contract to TransLink and is an integrated part of the regional transport system. SkyTrain uses a fare system shared with other local transit services and is policed by the Metro Vancouver Transit Police. SkyTrain attendants (STAs) provide first aid, emergency response, directions and customer service, inspect fares, monitor train faults, and operate the trains manually if necessary.

== Network ==

=== Expo Line ===

The Expo Line connects Waterfront station in Vancouver to King George station in Surrey, principally along a route established by the Westminster and Vancouver Tramway Company as an interurban line in 1890. The Expo Line (originally referred to as simply &quot;SkyTrain&quot; until the opening of the Millennium Line) was built in 1985 in time for Expo 86. It now has 24 stations. The Expo Line ran only as far as New Westminster station initially. In 1989, it was extended to Columbia station and in 1990, once the Skybridge was finished, it continued across the Fraser River to Scott Road station in Surrey. In 1994, the terminus of the Expo Line became King George station in central Surrey. It was built on a budget of $854million (1986 dollars). Effective October 22, 2016, Expo Line trains began operating on a new branch to Production Way–University station, taking over the previous Millennium Line service between Waterfront and that station. During peak periods, trains between Waterfront and Columbia arrive every 2 to 3 minutes. Between Waterfront and King George, trains arrive every 2 to 5 minutes during peak hours, while trains between Waterfront and Production Way arrive every 6 to 7 minutes in the peak hours.

=== Millennium Line ===

Prior to October 22, 2016, the Millennium Line shared tracks with the Expo Line from Waterfront station to Columbia station in New Westminster, then continued along its own elevated route through North Burnaby and East Vancouver, ending at VCC–Clark station, near Vancouver Community College&#x27;s Broadway campus. It was built on a $1.2-billion budget and the final extension from Commercial Drive station (now Commercial–Broadway station) to VCC–Clark station was opened on January 6, 2006. From October 22, 2016, to December 1, 2016, the Millennium Line operated from VCC–Clark to Lougheed Town Centre station. As of December 2, 2016, the Millennium Line operates between VCC–Clark station in Vancouver and Lafarge Lake–Douglas station in Coquitlam. The Millennium Line has 17 stations, three of which are transfer stations with the Expo Line (Commercial–Broadway, Production Way–University, and Lougheed Town Centre) and two which connect with the West Coast Express commuter train (Moody Centre and Coquitlam Central). The original Millennium Line&#x27;s stations were designed by British Columbia&#x27;s top architects and are very different from those on the Expo Line. In 2004, Busby and Associates Architects, designers of the Brentwood Town Centre station in Burnaby, were honoured for their work with a Governor General&#x27;s Medal in Architecture.

Construction on the Millennium Line&#x27;s Evergreen Extension, from Lougheed Town Centre in Burnaby to Lafarge Lake–Douglas in Coquitlam, was completed in 2016 and it was opened for revenue service on December 2, 2016. This extension adds and 6 new stations to the Millennium Line.

=== Canada Line ===

The Canada Line begins at the Waterfront station hub, then continues south through Vancouver into the City of Richmond and Sea Island. From Bridgeport station, the Canada Line splits into two branches, one heading west to the YVR–Airport station at Vancouver International Airport and the other continuing south to the Richmond–Brighouse station in Richmond&#x27;s city centre. Opened on August 17, 2009, the Canada Line added 15 stations and to the SkyTrain network. Waterfront station is the only station where the Canada Line directly connects with the Expo Line; however, Vancouver City Centre station is within a three-minute walk from Granville station via the Pacific Centre mall, making an unofficial transfer to the Expo Line. The Canada Line cost $1.9billion, financed by the Governments of Canada and British Columbia, TransLink, and InTransitBC. The Canada Line&#x27;s trains, built by Hyundai Rotem, are fully automated, but are of a different design from the Expo and Millennium Lines&#x27; Bombardier-built fleet. They use conventional electric motors rather than linear induction motor technology. Canada Line tracks do not interconnect with the rest of the SkyTrain network, and there is a separate fleet maintenance depot.

== Operations ==


=== Frequency ===
SkyTrain provides high-frequency service, with trains arriving every 2 to 6 minutes at all stations during peak hours. Trains operate between 4:48 a.m. and approximately 1:30 a.m. on weekdays, with reduced hours on weekends on the Expo and Millennium lines. SkyTrain has longer hours of service during special events, such as New Year&#x27;s Eve, the Vancouver 2010 Olympics, and marathons.

=== Fares ===
TransLink&#x27;s SkyTrain service area is divided into three zones, with fares varying depending on how many zone boundaries are crossed during one trip (two- and three-zone passengers are charged the one zone rate after 6:30 pm rush hour, and on weekends and statutory holidays). Customers may purchase fares using cash, debit cards, or credit cards from self-serve ticket vending machines at the mezzanine level of each station. A variety of transit passes are available, such as the pre-paid FareSaver ticket, daily DayPass, monthly FareCard, annual EmployerPass, post-secondary student U-Pass, and other specialized passes. Canadian National Institute for the Blind identification cards are accepted without the need to be read by the fare box. One-time fares are valid for 90 minutes on any mode of transportation with any number of transfers, including all SkyTrain lines and bus and SeaBus routes. Concession fares are available for secondary school students with a valid Go-Card and the elderly. Children under 12 have been able to ride the system for free since September 2021.

Until April 2016, SkyTrain&#x27;s fare system was a proof-of-payment system; there were no turnstiles at the entrances to train platforms. Instead, fares were typically enforced by random ticket inspections – usually by police or transit security but occasionally by SkyTrain attendants – through trains and stations. This was supplemented by controlled access – with the payment of a fare or proof of payment required to pass through a staffed gate – at special events where extremely high ridership was expected, such as immediately after BC Lions or Vancouver Canucks games.

==== Fare gates ====


Installing faregates to prevent fare evasion was considered as early as at the time of the system&#x27;s opening, but was rejected multiple times because the expense of implementing, maintaining, and enforcing them would exceed the losses prevented. In 2005, TransLink estimated it was losing $4million (5 percent of revenue attributed to SkyTrain) annually to fare evasion on SkyTrain. While the Canada Line stations, along with those on the Millennium Line, were designed to allow for future fare gates, the Canada Line opened in 2009 without them, despite stated intentions to include them. Expo Line stations have since been redesigned and retrofitted to accommodate the new fare gate system.

The 2008 Provincial Transit Plan outlined several SkyTrain system upgrades, including replacement of the proof-of-payment system with a gated-ticket system. According to Minister of Transportation Kevin Falcon, the gated-ticket system was to be implemented by a private company by 2010. In April 2009, it was announced that the provincial and federal governments would spend $100million to put the gates in place by the end of 2010. However, in August 2009, a TransLink spokesman said the gates would not be installed before 2012, and that a smart card system would be implemented at the same time.

It was announced on August 14, 2013, that bus-issued transfers (magnetic strip paper cards) would continue to be issued for cash fares paid on buses, but that these transfers would not work at SkyTrain or SeaBus station fare gates, which require a Compass Card or a 90-minute paper Compass ticket to operate. This means that a bus rider paying cash is required to pay a second fare to transfer to SkyTrain or SeaBus. Those transit users paying cash but beginning their trips at a SkyTrain or SeaBus station are not subject to this second fare because they are issued Compass tickets which are accepted as valid transfers on TransLink buses.

Construction of SkyTrain fare gates was completed in May 2014, but they remained open until April 2016 owing to multiple system problems. While open for the nearly two-year period, holders of paper-based monthly passes, bus-issued transfers, and FareSaver tickets continued to pass through the gates into the stations&#x27; fare-paid zones unimpeded, although they were subject to having their fare inspected by transit security or transit police once inside the fare-paid zone. Starting in April 2016, they were initially fully closed only during peak hours, with one gate remaining open during off-peak times for people with accessibility issues who could not reach their Compass Cards to the fare gates to tap in or out. Full implementation of the fare gates was also delayed by problems with Compass Cards when riders were tapping out as they exited buses. The tapping-out process on buses was too slow and did not always record the tap which—because the system initially deducted a three-zone fare until a tap-out was recorded and a refund was issued to those having only travelled one or two zones—often resulted in customers being charged for travelling through three zones when in fact they had only travelled through one or two. This was a serious setback for TransLink as the entire system was supposed to be operational by 2013. A solution was finally implemented where the requirement to tap out of buses was removed and all bus travel was considered as within a single zone, creating significant savings for those travelling multiple zones using buses only and in some cases changing transit usage patterns. The last fare gates left open for users with accessibility issues were closed on July 25, 2016, and the system has been in full operation since.

==== Airport surcharge ====
Travel on the Canada Line is free between the three Sea Island stations near the Vancouver International Airport: Templeton, Sea Island Centre, and YVR–Airport.

Single-use Compass tickets purchased with cash at Compass vending machines in stations on Sea Island include a surcharge, the &quot;YVR AddFare&quot;, of $5.00 on top of the normal fare. This charge is also added to trips initiated at Sea Island stations for travel east to Bridgeport station and beyond using Compass Card stored value or DayPasses. It is not applied to trips using monthly passes, nor to trips travelling to the airport using DayPasses or single-use Compass tickets which were purchased and activated off Sea Island. The YVR AddFare came into effect on January 18, 2010. The revenue collected from the AddFare goes back to TransLink.

=== Ridership ===
Passengers on SkyTrain made an average of 526,400 trips on weekdays . Overall in 2017, the network carried a total of 151million passengers. This compares to 117.4million passengers in 2010: 38,447,725 on the Canada Line and 78,965,214 on the interlined Expo and Millennium Lines. The Canada Line carried an average of 110,000 passengers per weekday in early 2011, and is three years ahead of ridership forecasts.

SkyTrain&#x27;s highest ridership came during the 2010 Winter Olympics when each event ticket included unlimited day-of transit usage. During the 17-day event, Canada Line ridership rose 110 per cent to an average of 228,000 per day, with a single-day record of 287,400 on February 19, 2010. Expo and Millennium Line ridership rose 64 per cent to an average of 394,000 per day, with a single-day record of 567,000 on February 20, 2010. At times, every available train was in service on all three lines. After the Olympics ended, overall transit usage remained 7.8 percent above the previous year.

=== Funding ===
The cost of operating SkyTrain in 2008, with an estimated 73.5million boardings, was $83million. To cover this, TransLink draws mostly from transit fares, advertising ($360million in 2008) and tax ($262million from fuel taxes and $298million from property taxes in 2008), funds which are also shared with bus services, roads and bridge maintenance, and other infrastructure and services. The capital costs of building the system are shared with other government agencies. Capital expenses were $216million in 2008. For example, the cost of building the Canada Line was shared between TransLink ($335million or 22 percent), the federal government (29 percent), the provincial government (28 percent), the airport authority (19 percent), and the City of Vancouver (2 percent). While TransLink has run surpluses for operating costs since 2001, it incurs debt to cover these capital costs. As a whole, TransLink had $1.1billion in long-term debt in 2006, of which $508million was transferred from the province in 1999 when responsibility for SkyTrain was given to TransLink. The province retained ownership of the causeway, bridge, certain services, and a portion of SkyTrain&#x27;s debt.

=== Security ===
Law enforcement services are provided by the Metro Vancouver Transit Police (MVTP). They replaced the old TransLink Special Provincial Constables, who had limited authority.

On December 4, 2005, MVTP officers became the first and only transit police force in Canada to have full police powers and carry firearms. There was public concern in March 2005 when it was announced that transit police would carry firearms. Solicitor General of British Columbia John Les defended the move at the time, saying that it was necessary to enhance SkyTrain security. Transit officers receive the same training as officers in municipal and RCMP forces. They may arrest people for outstanding warrants, enforce drug laws, enforce the criminal code beyond TransLink property, and deal with offences that begin off TransLink property and make their way onto it. They issue tickets for fare evasion and other infractions on SkyTrain, transit buses, SeaBus, and West Coast Express.

Transit police officers and Transit Security officers inspect fares at Skytrain stations as part of TransLink&#x27;s fare audit. Transit Security officers mostly focus their efforts on the bus system, bus loops, and SeaBus.

SkyTrain attendants provide customer service and first aid, troubleshoot train and station operations, and perform fare checks alongside the transit police force. SkyTrain attendants can be identified by their uniforms which say &quot;SkyTrain&quot; on them.

Over the years, violence and other criminal activities have been concerns at time, but TransLink maintains that the system is safe. In 2009, Inspector Kash Heed of the Vancouver Police Department said that little crime takes place in the stations themselves; however, criminal activity becomes more visible outside them.

Each station is monitored with an average of 23 closed-circuit television cameras, allowing SkyTrain operators to monitor passenger and station activity. Designated waiting areas have enhanced lighting, benches, and emergency telephones. Trains have yellow strips above each window which, when pressed, silently alert operators of a security hazard. On-board speaker phones provide two-way communication between passengers and control operators.

In 2007, it was reported that the entire surveillance system was upgraded from analogue two-hour tape recording to digital technology, which was to allow police to retrieve previous footage for up to seven days. However, incidents since the upgrade have still limited police to a two-hour loop, resulting in loss of potential evidence.

By November 2008, at least 54 deaths had occurred on the platforms and tracks of the Expo and Millennium Lines. 44 of those deaths were suicides, while the remaining ten were accidental.

== History ==

=== Planning ===
Vancouver had plans as early as the 1950s to build a monorail system, with modernist architect Wells Coates to design it; that project was abandoned. The lack of a rapid transit system was said to be the cause of traffic problems in the 1970s, and the municipal government could not fund the construction of such a system. During the same period, Urban Transportation Development Corporation, then an Ontario crown corporation, was developing a new rapid transit technology known as an &quot;Intermediate Capacity Transit System&quot;. In 1980, the &quot;Advanced Light Rapid Transit&quot; system was selected by the British Columbia provincial government for use on one of two planned corridors, connecting Vancouver to New Westminster in time for Expo 86.

=== Expo Line ===

SkyTrain was conceived as a legacy project of Expo 86 and the first line was finished in time to showcase the fair&#x27;s theme: &quot;Transportation and Communication: World in Motion – World in Touch&quot;. Construction was funded by the provincial and federal governments and began in March 1982. It was built through the Dunsmuir Tunnel under downtown, which had originally been built for the Canadian Pacific Railway, to save costs.

The first of the system, from Waterfront to New Westminster station, opened for limited and fare-free service on December 11, 1985. Revenue service began on January 3, 1986, and within its first year the line had carried over 30 million passengers—including visitors to Expo 86. The following year, construction began on an extension including the SkyBridge, Columbia station, and Scott Road station, extending service by to Surrey; it opened on March 16, 1990. The line was expanded again in 1994 with the opening of Gateway, Surrey Central, and King George stations. SkyTrain is part of the 1996 Greater Vancouver Regional District&#x27;s (GVRD) Livable Region Strategic Plan, which discusses strategies to deal with the anticipated increase of population in the region. These strategies include increasing transportation choices and transit use.

=== Millennium Line ===
The first section of the Millennium Line opened in 2002, with Braid and Sapperton stations. Most of the remaining portion began operating later that year, serving North Burnaby and East Vancouver. Phase I of the Millennium Line was completed $50million under budget. Critics of the project dubbed it the &quot;SkyTrain to Nowhere&quot;, claiming that the route of the new line was based on political concerns, not the needs of commuters. One illustration of the legitimacy of this complaint is that the end of the Millennium Line is located in a vacant field, chosen because it was supposed to be the location for a new high-tech development and is close to the head office of QLT Inc., but additional development was slow to get off the ground. That station, VCC–Clark near Clark Drive and Broadway, did not open until 2006 due to the struggles of negotiating the right-of-way with BNSF, the owner of the freight tracks beside the station, but it is still five kilometres short of the original proposed Phase II terminus at Granville Street and 10th Avenue. At the time VCC–Clark station opened, it was revealed that the additional westward extension and its three stations was out of favour and &quot;not a high priority anymore&quot;.

==== Evergreen Extension ====
The Evergreen Extension, known as the Evergreen Line during construction, is the second phase of the Millennium Line, extending from Lougheed Mall in Burnaby to the Douglas College campus in Coquitlam. Originally referred to as the Port Moody-Coquitlam (PMC) Line, it provides a &quot;one-seat ride&quot; from Coquitlam to Vancouver. Switches to the PMC Line were installed to the east of Lougheed Town Centre station during its initial construction and a third platform at the station was roughed-in in anticipation of the extension. Phase II was postponed following a change in provincial government and a shuffling of priorities that led to prioritizing building the Canada Line due to Vancouver&#x27;s hosting of the 2010 Olympics. Preliminary construction of the Evergreen Extension began in July 2012 and major construction started in June 2013 with the construction of support columns for the line. The extension began revenue service on December 2, 2016.

=== Canada Line ===

The Canada Line was built as a public–private partnership, with the winning consortium (now known as ProTransBC), led by SNC-Lavalin, contributing funds toward its construction and operating it for 35 years. A minimum ridership was guaranteed to ProTransBC by TransLink. The Richmond–Vancouver corridor had been considered for a rapid transit line as early as 1979 but such a project was not funded until the early 2000s with the approval of the Canada Line. The line opened on August 17, 2009, 15 weeks ahead of schedule and on budget. Ridership rose three years ahead of forecasts, hitting 100,000 passengers per weekday in May 2010 and 136,000 passengers per weekday in June 2011. The Canada Line is operationally independent from the other SkyTrain lines, using different rolling stock (shorter overall train and station length, but wider cars) that is incompatible with the Expo and Millennium Lines.

=== Impact ===
SkyTrain has had a significant impact on the development of areas near stations, and has helped to shape urban density in Metro Vancouver. Between 1991 and 2001, the population living within of SkyTrain increased by 37 percent, compared to the regional average of 24 percent. Since SkyTrain opened, the total population of the service area rose from 400,000 to 1.3million people. According to BC Transit&#x27;s document &quot;SkyTrain: A catalyst for development&quot;, more than $5billion of private money had been invested within a 10–15 minute walking distance of the SkyTrain and SeaBus. The report claimed that the two modes of transportation were the driving force of the investment, though it did not disaggregate the general growth in that area.

== Design ==
=== Routes ===

There are three main routes: the Expo Line, Millennium Line and Canada Line. The Expo Line travels between Waterfront station in Downtown Vancouver and Columbia station in New Westminster, serving the cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster. From Columbia, the Expo Line splits into two branches. One branch travels through Surrey to King George station, while the other travels through New Westminster and Burnaby, terminating at Production Way–University station.

Millennium Line trains travel between VCC–Clark station and Lafarge Lake–Douglas station in the city of Coquitlam. Near the western end of the line is a major transfer point with the Expo Line at Commercial–Broadway station. Further east, Lougheed Town Centre station and Production Way–University station serve as two more transfer points with the Expo Line.

The Canada Line travels southward from Waterfront station in Downtown Vancouver to Richmond, where the track splits at Bridgeport station; trains alternate between a southern branch ending at Richmond–Brighouse station and a western branch ending at Vancouver International Airport.

Although most of the system is elevated, SkyTrain runs at or below grade through Downtown Vancouver, for the Vancouver portion of the Canada Line until just before it reaches Richmond at Marine Drive station, through the tunnel used by the Millennium Line between Coquitlam and Port Moody, through the tunnel between Columbia and Sapperton stations in New Westminster, and for short stretches in Burnaby and New Westminster.

SkyTrain&#x27;s Expo Line uses the world&#x27;s second longest bridge dedicated to transit services, the SkyBridge, which crosses the Fraser River between New Westminster and Surrey. It is a cable-stayed bridge, with towers. Two additional transit-only bridges, the North Arm Bridge and the Middle Arm Bridge, were built for the Canada Line. The North Arm Bridge is an extradosed bridge with a total length of , with shorter towers necessitated by its proximity to the Vancouver International Airport, and also has a pedestrian/bicycle deck connecting the bicycle networks of Vancouver and Richmond. The Middle Arm Bridge is a shorter box girder bridge.

=== Technology ===
The signalling technology used on all three SkyTrain lines to run trains automatically was originally developed by Alcatel and loaded from a 3.5&quot; diskette. There were initially four systems called the vehicle control computer (VCC) with three divided over the mainline and one for the storage yard. VCC1 controls trains from Waterfront to Royal Oak; VCC2 controls trains from Royal Oak to King George (it now also controls a portion of the Millennium Line); and VCC3 controls trains in the yard. Additional VCCs were added as Skytrain expanded. Each VCC is a cluster of three IBM Type 7588 rack-mount single-board computers with Intel-IA32 Pentium processors and proprietary hardware in a fault-tolerant configuration. For example, VCC3 is composed of CPU1, CPU2, and CPU3. For every command that is sent to a train, at least two of the CPUs must agree with the action, otherwise an error is generated and the command is ignored. The VCC communicates with the train&#x27;s vehicle on board computer (VOBC), whose data is transmitted through coax cables laid along the tracks. There are up to two VOBCs per married-pair trains, i.e. 4-car train would have two VOBCs. If the VCCs fail or communication between the VCC and the VOBC is lost, the train will &quot;time-out&quot; and emergency-brake (EB) through a Quester Tangent brake assurance monitor (BAM) that controls propulsion and braking systems. The VCCs have a command-line-console, but normally the trains are controlled through a system known as the SMC, which also provides scheduling. All commands from the SMC are verified to be safe by the VCC before execution. However if the SMC fails, the system can still be operated through the VCC. This is known as &quot;degraded mode&quot;. The SkyTrain health monitoring unit (HMU) developed by Quester Tangent provides monitoring and diagnostic functionality for vehicle maintenance by connecting to CAN vehicle network and providing a maintenance display in the Hostler Panel.

SkyTrain&#x27;s signalling system later provided the basis of SelTrac, which is currently maintained and sold by Thales and has equipped many lines around the world. Largely as a result of this, the Expo and Millennium Lines have a combined punctuality record of over 96 percent; the principal cause of train delays is passenger interference with train doors. There have been two derailments during revenue service in the system&#x27;s history.

=== Accessibility ===
The SkyTrain network is fully mobility-needs accessible, including vehicles and stations. Mark I train cars have one designated wheelchair position, Mark II, Mark III and Hyundai Rotem cars have two, and all stations have elevators. TransLink upgraded all Expo Line platform station edges to match those on the Millennium Line shortly after it was completed. The new, wider edges are brighter and are tiled to provide a safer environment for the visually impaired. The Canada Line also uses this safety feature in its stations. Since the opening of the Millennium Line, aside from platform tile upgrading, many Expo line stations have also been refitted with new signage and ticket vending machines. Accessibility is provided for deaf individuals through real-time English signage and displays at stations and on newer trains, although a reliance on verbal communication for service disruptions has been identified as a transportation barrier.

The distinctive three-tone chime used in the SkyTrain system was recorded in 1984–85 at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver. The automated train announcements have been voiced by Laureen Regan since the opening of the Millennium Line in 2002, and by Karen Kelm between 1985 and 2001.

== Rolling stock ==
=== Expo and Millennium Lines ===
The Expo Line and Millennium Line use Bombardier&#x27;s Advanced Rapid Transit (ART) system, a system of automated trains driven by linear induction motors, formerly known as Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS). These trains reach speeds of ; including wait times at stops, the end-to-end average speed is , three times faster than a bus and almost twice as fast as a B-Line express bus. During cold weather, TransLink crews use hockey sticks to clear snow and ice from train doors, which would otherwise prevent some doors from being able to open. The trains are also slowed and staffed by TransLink attendants, who can manually override the automatic controls in the event of an obstruction caused by snow or ice.

==== UTDC ICTS Mark I fleet ====

The initial fleet consisted of lightweight Mark I ICTS cars from Urban Transportation Development Corporation, similar to those used by Toronto&#x27;s Line 3 Scarborough and the Detroit People Mover. Mark I vehicles are composed of mated pairs and normally run as six-car trains and only on the Expo Line, but can be run in two-, four-, or six-car configurations. The maximum based on current station platform lengths is a six-car configuration, totalling . The SkyTrain fleet includes 150 Mark I cars. These trains have a mix of forward-, reverse- and side-facing seats; red, white, and blue interiors; and four doors per car, two per side.

==== Bombardier ART Mark II fleet ====

When the Millennium Line was built, TransLink ordered new-generation Mark II ART trains from Bombardier Transportation, some of which were assembled in a Burnaby factory. Similar trains are used in Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s Kelana Jaya Line, New York&#x27;s JFK AirTrain, and the Beijing Airport Express. These trains are run in four-car configurations on the Expo Line, and two-car configurations on the Millennium Line. Each pair of cars is semi-permanently joined together in a twin unit or &quot;married pair&quot;, with a length of . Mark II trains have a streamlined front and rear, an articulated joint allowing passengers to walk the length of a married pair, white/grey/blue interior, and six doors per car, three per side. TransLink also ordered 48 Mark II ART (2009/2010 model) in 2009 to further supplement supply and integrate new features like CCTV and visual maps with LED lights.

==== Bombardier Innovia Metro 300 (ART Mark III) fleet ====
The Bombardier ART model has undergone several redesigns from the original UTDC ICTS model, and the Mark II design has been updated by Bombardier, with this newest offering being the Innovia Metro 300. Dimensions are similar to the Mark II, with capacity improvements offered over the outgoing model through redesigned car layout. TransLink ordered 28 Mark III cars, which began delivery in 2015, and went into service beginning in August 2016. The vehicles appear sleeker, with larger windows on the sides of the train, and redesigned windows and headlights on the ends of the cars. The interior is largely similar to the second generation of Mark II cars, with the some seats removed to better accommodate bicycles and strollers. TransLink has claimed that the interior of the Mark III offers better sound and heat insulation. TransLink ordered the cars for the Evergreen Extension in a 4-car articulated configuration, with two centre cars, to allow full-length train movements by passengers. However, due to a shortage of trains, the Mark IIIs are being used on the Expo Line, while 2-car Innovia 200 (Mk2) serve the Millennium Line. On December 16, 2016, TransLink ordered 28 more Mark III cars, bringing the total of Mark III cars to 56 by the end of 2019. On February 22, 2018, TransLink announced a further order of 28 Mark III cars, which will bring the total number of Mark III cars to 84 once all trains are in service by the end of 2020.

=== Canada Line ===

The Canada Line uses Hyundai Rotem EMU vehicles, with cars powered by conventional electric motors instead of the linear induction motor (LIM) technology used by the Expo and Millennium Line vehicles; as a result, the Canada Line vehicles cannot be used on the Expo and Millennium Lines. There are 20 trains, which operate as two-carriage articulated units and can reach a speed of . They are maintained at a yard next to Bridgeport station in Richmond.

On February 22, 2018, TransLink announced an additional order of 24 Canada Line cars to be brought into service by 2020, bringing the total to 32 trains operating as two-car units.

== Future expansion ==
Several possible expansions to the SkyTrain network have been announced. In 2005, TransLink released a ten-year outlook outlining a potential line to the University of British Columbia (UBC) and further expansion of the Expo Line into Surrey. In 2011, two separate rapid transit studies have given further examination and consultation into rapid transit options for expansion for the UBC–Broadway corridor, and Surrey and the South of Fraser region. Expo Line capacity upgrades are also being planned to meet future demand.

A pair of expansions—the Broadway corridor extension and the Expo Line to Langley—began construction in the early 2020s alongside the addition of 235 new cars and upgrades to SkyTrain facilities.

===Broadway corridor extension===
Early proposals planned to extend SkyTrain west along the Broadway corridor, but stopped well short of UBC because of the cost, estimated at $700million in 1999. However, the Provincial Transit Plan, released in February 2008, included funding for the entire Broadway corridor to UBC. The line would replace the region&#x27;s busiest bus routes, where over 100,000 trips are made daily. The line would also include an interchange with the Canada Line at Cambie Street. In 2008, the new line was estimated to cost $2.8billion, with an expected completion date of 2020.

Government statements suggested that the UBC line would be an extension of the SkyTrain network from VCC–Clark station via elevated platforms or a tunnel along Broadway ending at University of British Columbia Vancouver. This would mean that riders travelling from Coquitlam to UBC would not need to change trains, as Millennium Line trains would continue to UBC from Lafarge Lake–Douglas station. Riders from the Evergreen Extension east of Commercial–Broadway station would also have a secondary route to downtown with the option of transferring to the Canada Line instead of the Expo Line. However, light rail and higher-capacity bus rapid transit were also proposed.

In 2011, with the UBC Line Rapid Transit Study, SkyTrain was evaluated as a possible technology for rapid transit expansion along the Broadway corridor to UBC, along with light rail transit and bus rapid Transit. The June 2014 plan proposes a first phase that would extend the Millennium Line from VCC–Clark station to Arbutus Street using SkyTrain technology, with an interchange with the Canada Line at Broadway–City Hall station; a second phase would see the line extended from Arbutus to UBC. A plebiscite to raise 25 percent of the funds required for the Broadway extension to Arbutus, among other transit expansion plans, was defeated in 2015.

On March 16, 2018, the provincial government approved the construction of an extension of the Millennium Line underneath Broadway, which will extend the line underground west to Arbutus Street, while adding six new stations. Early work was slated to begin in 2019 with a completion date set for 2025. On April 19, 2018, the UBC Board of Governors indicated it would consider contributing funds towards accelerating the extension of the Millennium Line from its new planned terminus at Arbutus to the university.

On January 30, 2019, Vancouver City Council endorsed building the line underground all the way to UBC.

On July 17, 2020, the British Columbia government announced that the Acciona–Ghella Joint Venture Company had been selected to receive the design–build contract for the Broadway extension. Premier John Horgan confirmed on September 4, 2020, that construction would proceed in the fourth quarter of 2020 despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in British Columbia. Horgan also confirmed that the extension is expected to be in service by 2025. Transportation Minister Claire Trevena also stated that there were no immediate plans to extend the line towards the UBC campus.

The provincial government announced on November 24, 2022, that the opening of the extension would be pushed back to early 2026 owing to a labour dispute affecting concrete workers which took place that June. On May 24, 2024, the provincial government announced that the extension opening would be further delayed to late 2027, due to various delays which occurred during the tunnel-boring process.

=== Expo Line extension ===

The 2008 Provincial Transit Plan included a extension of the Expo Line from King George station in Surrey east to Guildford, then along 152 Street to Fraser Highway and southeast to 168 Street; a further extension to Willowbrook Shopping Centre in Langley City was also included in the plan. After a period of time where SkyTrain, light rail transit, and bus rapid transit were considered for service expansion, federal funding was secured in 2021 to build a SkyTrain extension to Langley City at a total cost (shared between the federal government, provincial government, and TransLink) between $3.8 and $3.95billion. In July 2022, the extension received approval from the provincial government to be built in one single phase, opening in 2028 with eight stations. Procurement for private contractors began in October 2022 and was scheduled to end with the selection of winning bids by December 2023. The project was divided into three general contracts—the guideway, stations, and electrical systems. Construction began in November 2024 and is, expected to be completed in 2029.

=== Expo Line capacity expansion ===

Several options have been considered, planned, or implemented to improve capacity on the Expo Line, including operating longer trains, reducing operating headways, and extending station platforms beyond . In late 2020, TransLink ordered 41 Alstom Mark V trainsets in five-car configurations that will eventually replace older, lower-capacity trains. Six more Alstom Mark V trainsets were ordered in May 2024, bring this total to 47 Mark V trainsets.

=== Coquitlam maintenance facility ===
In March 2021, it was announced that a new yard would be constructed to provide storage space and maintenance needed for the upcoming extensions of the Expo and Millennium lines. This new facility is to be located near the New Westminster–Coquitlam border along North Road. The land was purchased for $82.5million, while the cost for the structure and additional tracks was estimated at an additional $300million. The new yard was expected to provide additional maintenance and space in time for the opening of the Millennium Line&#x27;s Broadway extension in early 2026. As of February 2024, the opening of the Coquitlam maintenance facility, which is expected to have a storage capacity of 145 cars, is scheduled to take place in 2027.

=== University of British Columbia extension ===
On January 14, 2008, the British Columbia provincial government announced a commitment to the expansion of the Millennium Line to the University of British Columbia (UBC) by 2020 as part of a $14-billion transit spending package to address climate change. It was not clear what route the new line would take, but it was hinted that there would be less use of cut-and-cover tunnelling to minimize disruption to businesses along Broadway and avoid the same problems seen during the Canada Line construction along Cambie Street. This expansion failed to materialize. On February 15, 2019, the TransLink Mayors&#x27; Council again approved an extension of the line to the UBC campus, although funding for this continuation past Arbutus Street had not yet been secured. In April 2022, TransLink assessed possible route options in the UBC area, including the provision of additional pocket storage tracks near the UBC terminus owing to the distance between the university and the nearest storage yard. As a result, the terminus at UBC would hypothetically be larger in size in order to accommodate the additional storage space and operational flexibility. In March 2023, it was announced that a contractor would be hired to put together a business case for the extension, which was to be presented in December 2024.

=== Port Coquitlam extension ===
When the Evergreen Extension was built, the first few metres of track and a track switch for an eventual eastward extension to Port Coquitlam were built at Coquitlam Central station. Such an extension would create two branches where trains would alternate between going east to Lafarge Lake–Douglas station or Port Coquitlam. A feasibility study was conducted, started during early 2020 and running for about six months. Both Port Coquitlam mayor Brad West, Port Coquitlam&#x27;s city council, and Coquitlam&#x27;s city council have stated support for the extension. However, as of 2022, no funding had been secured nor a formal plan created.

=== North Shore connection ===
In 2019, the BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure announced its intention to study a rapid transit link from Vancouver&#x27;s city centre to the North Shore, possibly in the form of SkyTrain. By March 2020, the provincial government confirmed it had selected six possible routes for a &quot;high-capacity, fixed-link, rapid transit crossing across Burrard Inlet between Vancouver and the North Shore&quot;. In 2022, TransLink suggested that a North Shore link would likely be created using bus rapid transit first while a concurrent feasibility study of a longer-term light rail transit or SkyTrain connection is conducted.

<doc id="125275" wikidata="Q961972" url="?curid=125275" title="Matt Ridley">
<text>Matthew White Ridley, 5th Viscount Ridley (born 7 February 1958), is a British science writer, journalist and businessman. He is known for his writings on science, the environment, and economics, and has been a regular contributor to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. Ridley was chairman of the UK bank Northern Rock from 2004 to 2007, during which period it experienced the first run on a British bank in 130 years. He resigned, and the bank was bailed out by the UK government; this led to its nationalisation.

Ridley is a libertarian, and a staunch supporter of Brexit. He inherited the viscountcy in February 2012 and was a Conservative hereditary peer from February 2013, with an elected seat in the House of Lords, until his retirement in December 2021.

==Early life and education==
Ridley&#x27;s parents were Matthew White Ridley, 4th Viscount Ridley (1925–2012), and Lady Anne Katharine Gabrielle Lumley (1928–2006), the daughter of Roger Lumley, 11th Earl of Scarbrough. He is the nephew of the late Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) and minister Nicholas Ridley and the great grandson of Edwin Lutyens.

Ridley attended Eton College from 1970 to 1975, and then went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study zoology. Obtaining a BA degree with first class honours, Ridley continued with research on the mating system of the common pheasant (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;) supervised by Chris Perrins for his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1983.

==Career==

===Journalism===
Ridley joined &quot;The Economist&quot; in 1984, first working as a science editor until 1987, then as Washington, D.C., correspondent from 1987 to 1989 and as American editor from 1990 to 1992. He was a columnist for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and an editor of &quot;The Best American Science Writing 2002&quot;.

From 2010 to 2013, Ridley wrote the weekly &quot;Mind and Matter&quot; column for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, which &quot;explores the science of human nature and its implications&quot;.

Since 2013, Ridley has written a weekly column for &quot;The Times&quot; on science, the environment, and economics.

Ridley wrote the majority of the main article of the August 2017 edition of &quot;BBC Focus&quot; magazine. The article explains his scepticism regarding resource depletion, challenging the widespread belief that resource depletion is an important issue. He cites various previous resource scares as his evidence.

===Northern Rock, 1994–2007===
In 1994, Ridley became a board member of the UK bank Northern Rock. His father had been a board member for 30 years, and chairman from 1987 to 1992. Ridley became chairman in 2004.

In September 2007, Northern Rock became the first British bank since 1878 to suffer a run on its finances, at the start of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The bank applied to the Bank of England for emergency liquidity funding at the beginning of the crisis, but failed, and Northern Rock was nationalised. Ridley resigned as chairman in October 2007. A parliamentary committee criticised him for not recognising the risks of the bank&#x27;s financial strategy and &quot;harming the reputation of the British banking industry&quot;.

===Business===
From 1996 to 2003, Ridley served as founding chairman of the International Centre for Life, which opened in 2000 as a non-profit science centre in Newcastle upon Tyne; and is now its honorary life president. From July 2000 to June 2008, he was a non-executive director of PA Holdings Limited, with Victor Halberstadt.

Until 2010, he was a governor of the Ditchley Foundation, which organises conferences to further education and understanding of Britons and North Americans. He participated in a February 2000 Ditchley conference.

==Patronage==
The Banks Group and Blagdon estate developed and sponsored the construction of Northumberlandia, or the Lady of the North, a land sculpture in the shape of a reclining female figure, which was part-commissioned and sponsored by Ridley. Now run by a charity group called the Land Trust, it is the largest landform in the world depicting the human form, and, through private funding, cost £3m to build. Attracting over 100,000 people per year, the Northumberland art project, tourism and cultural landmark has won a global landscape architecture award, and has been named &#x27;Miss World&#x27;.

The Royal Agricultural Society of England awarded the Bledisloe Gold Medal in 2015 to Ridley for the work done on his Blagdon estate, saying that it &quot;wanted to highlight the extensive environmental improvement work that has been undertaken across the land&quot;.

==Publications==
Ridley has written a number of popular science books, listed below.

&quot;The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature&quot;, 1993

: In Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, Alice meets the Red Queen who stays in the same place no matter how fast she runs. This book champions a Red Queen theory for the evolution of sexual reproduction: that it evolved so that the resultant genetic variation would thwart constantly mutating parasites.

&quot;The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation&quot;, 1996

&quot;&quot;, 1999

: This book examines one newly discovered gene from each of the 23 human chromosomes. It was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize in 2000.

&quot;Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, &amp; What Makes Us Human&quot;, 2003 (also later released under the title &quot;The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture&quot; in 2004)

: This book discusses reasons why humans can be considered to be simultaneously free-willed and motivated by instinct and culture.

&quot;The Agile Gene: How Nature Turns on Nurture&quot;, 2004

&quot;Francis Crick: Discoverer of the Genetic Code&quot;, 2006

: Ridley&#x27;s biography of Francis Crick won the Davis Prize for the history of science from the US History of Science Society.

&quot;The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves&quot;, 2010

: &quot;The Rational Optimist&quot; primarily focuses on the benefits of the innate human tendency to trade goods and services. Ridley argues that this trait is the source of human prosperity, and that as people increasingly specialize in their skill sets, we will have increased trade and even more prosperity. It was shortlisted for the 2011 BBC Samuel Johnson Prize.

&quot;The Evolution of Everything: How Ideas Emerge&quot;, 2015

: In &quot;The Evolution of Everything&quot;, Ridley &quot;makes the case for evolution, rather than design, as the force that has shaped much of culture, technology and society, and that even now is shaping our future.&quot; He argues that &quot;Change in technology, language, mortality and society is incremental, inexorable, gradual and spontaneous...Much of the human world is the result of human action, but not of human design; it emerges from the interactions of millions, not from the plans of a few.&quot; The science writer Peter Forbes, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, describes the book as &quot;Ridley&#x27;s magnum opus, ... decades in the making.&quot; Forbes states that Ridley was inspired by the Roman poet Lucretius&#x27;s long work on &quot;atheistical atomism&quot;, &quot;De rerum natura&quot;, whose &quot;arguments seem uncannily modern: like those of a Richard Dawkins 2000 years avant la lettre.&quot; Forbes found the chapter on technology to be &quot;utterly convincing&quot;, the most satisfying in the book. But he finds the &quot;sustained polemic on behalf of libertarian anti-State ideas not a million miles from those of the US Republican Tea Party.&quot; Forbes calls Ridley &quot;a heretic on most counts&quot;, stating that the book has many excesses. All the same, he considers the book necessary reading.

&quot;How Innovation Works: And Why It Flourishes in Freedom&quot;, 2020

: This book argues that innovation is a disorganized, bottom-up process that emerges through the aggregate work of many low-level individuals, rather than the work of solitary geniuses at the top. Moreover, innovation is poorly understood by economists, and it is often impeded by politicians. Ridley makes his case by examining historical examples, rather than appealing solely to abstract principles.

:Written jointly with Alina Chan, it was published in November 2021.

&quot;Birds, Sex and Beauty: The Extraordinary Implications of Charles Darwin&#x27;s Strangest Idea&quot;, 2025

Ridley&#x27;s first book was &quot;Warts and All: The Men Who Would Be Bush&quot; (1989), which chronicled the evolution of George H. W. Bush&#x27;s public image during the 1988 United States presidential election. Ridley has since described his first book as &quot;bad&quot; and has expressed gratitude that few people know about it. He no longer promotes the book on his personal website.

In 2006, Ridley contributed a chapter to &quot;Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think&quot;, a collection of essays in honour of his friend Richard Dawkins.

Ridley&#x27;s 2010 TED conference talk, &quot;When Ideas Have Sex&quot;, received over 2 million views. Ridley argues that exchange and specialisation are the features of human society that lead to the development of new ideas, and that human society is therefore a &quot;collective brain&quot;.

==Political and scientific views==
===Role of government regulation===
In a 2006 edition of the online magazine &quot;Edge – the third culture&quot;, Ridley wrote a response to the question &quot;What&#x27;s your dangerous idea?&quot; which was entitled &quot;Government is the problem not the solution&quot;, in which he describes his attitude to government regulation: &quot;In every age and at every time there have been people who say we need more regulation, more government. Sometimes, they say we need it to protect exchange from corruption, to set the standards and police the rules, in which case they have a point, though often they exaggerate it... The dangerous idea we all need to learn is that the more we limit the growth of government, the better off we will all be.&quot;

In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; connecting Ridley&#x27;s libertarian economic philosophy and the £27 billion failure of Northern Rock. On 1 June 2010 Monbiot followed up his previous article in the context of Matt Ridley&#x27;s book &quot;The Rational Optimist&quot;, which had just been published. Monbiot took the view that Ridley had failed to learn from the collapse of Northern Rock.

Ridley has responded to Monbiot on his website, stating &quot;George Monbiot&#x27;s recent attack on me in the &quot;Guardian&quot; is misleading. I do not hate the state. In fact, my views are much more balanced than Monbiot&#x27;s selective quotations imply.&quot; On 19 June 2010, Monbiot countered with another article on the &quot;Guardian&quot; website, further questioning Ridley&#x27;s claims and his response. Ridley was then defended by Terence Kealey in a further article published on the &quot;Guardian&quot; website.

In November 2010, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published a lengthy exchange between Ridley and the Microsoft founder Bill Gates on topics discussed in Ridley&#x27;s book &quot;The Rational Optimist&quot;. Gates said that &quot;What Mr. Ridley fails to see is that worrying about the worst case—being pessimistic, to a degree—can actually help to drive a solution&quot;; Ridley said &quot;I am certainly not saying, &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry, be happy.&#x27; Rather, I&#x27;m saying, &#x27;Don&#x27;t despair, be ambitious.&#x27;&quot;

Ridley summarised his own views on his political philosophy during the 2011 Hayek Lecture: &quot;[T]hat the individual is not – and had not been for 120,000 years – able to support his lifestyle; that the key feature of trade is that it enables us to work for each other not just for ourselves; that there is nothing so anti-social (or impoverishing) as the pursuit of self sufficiency; and that authoritarian, top-down rule is not the source of order or progress.&quot;

In an email exchange, Ridley responded to the environmental activist Mark Lynas&#x27; repeated charges of a right-wing agenda with the following reply:

Ridley argues that the capacity of humans for change and social progress is underestimated, and denies what he sees as overly pessimistic views of global climate change and Western birthrate decline.

===Climate change===

In 2014, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed written by Ridley, &quot;Whatever Happened to Global Warming?&quot; suggesting that climate scientists&#x27; explanations were implausible, was challenged by Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University&#x27;s Earth Institute. Sachs termed &quot;absurd&quot; Ridley&#x27;s characterization of a paper in &quot;Science&quot; magazine by the two scientists Xianyao Chen and Ka-Kit Tung. Sachs challenged Ridley&#x27;s contentions, and claimed that the &quot;paper&#x27;s conclusions are the very opposite of Ridley&#x27;s&quot;. Ridley replied that &#x27;it is ludicrous, nasty and false to accuse me of lying or &quot;totally misrepresenting the science..I have asked Mr. Sachs to withdraw the charges more than once now on Twitter. He has refused to do so ...&quot;&#x27;

Friends of the Earth has connected Ridley&#x27;s opposition to climate science to his ties to the coal industry. He is the owner of land in the north-east of England on which the Shotton Surface coal mine operates, and receives payments for the mine. In 2016 he was accused of lobbying for the coal industry, based on an email he had authored to the UK government&#x27;s energy minister describing a Texas-based company which planned to sequester carbon into materials useful for industrial chemical manufacturing. The complaint was summarily dismissed by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.

===Shale gas and fracking===
Ridley was one of the earliest commentators to spot the economic significance of shale gas. He is a proponent of fracking. However, he has been found to have breached the Parliamentary Code of Conduct by the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards for not orally disclosing in debates on the subject personal interests worth at least £50,000 in Weir Group, which has been described as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest provider of special equipment used in the process&quot; of fracking.

===Euroscepticism===
Ridley is a Eurosceptic and advocated the withdrawal (Brexit) of the UK from the European Union during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. He appeared in &quot;&quot;, arguing for Britain to return to the policy of free trade that distinguished it after 1845 until the 1930s.

===Free-market anticapitalism===
Ridley wrote a 2017 column making the case for free-market anticapitalism. He makes the case that it is misleading to refer to &#x27;capitalism&#x27; and &#x27;markets&#x27; as the same thing because &quot;commerce, enterprise and markets are – to me – the very opposite of corporatism and even of &#x27;capitalism&#x27;, if by that word you mean capital-intensive organisations with monopolistic ambitions. Markets and innovation are the creative-destructive forces that undermine, challenge and reshape corporations and public bureaucracies on behalf of consumers. So big business is just as much the enemy as big government, and big business in hock to big government is sometimes the worst of all.&quot;

===COVID-19===
Ridley wrote in May 2020 that &quot;research into the origins of the new coronavirus raises questions about how it became so infectious in human beings&quot; and included as one possibility &quot;perhaps laboratories&quot;. His 2021 book &quot;&quot; written with Alina Chan, which received mixed reviews, ascribes the most likely proximate origin of the virus to the COVID-19 lab leak theory.

==Honours, awards and titles==
In 1996, he was a visiting professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and in 2006 was awarded an honorary DSc degree.

In 2003, he received an honorary DSc degree from Buckingham University and in 2007, an honorary DCL degree from Newcastle University.

In 2004, he was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) for &quot;major contributions to public engagement with the biological sciences&quot;.

In 2011, the Manhattan Institute awarded Ridley its $50,000 Hayek Prize for his book &quot;The Rational Optimist&quot;. In his acceptance speech, Ridley said: &quot;As Hayek understood, it is human collaboration that is necessary for society to work... the key feature of trade is that it enables us to work for each other not just for ourselves; that attempts at self-sufficiency are the true form of selfishness as well as the quick road to poverty; and that authoritarian, top-down rule is not the source of order or progress.&quot; In 2011, Ridley gave the Angus Millar Lecture on &quot;scientific heresy&quot; at the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).

In 2012, on the death of his father, Ridley became the 5th Viscount Ridley and Baron Wensleydale. He is also the 9th Baronet Ridley. In 2013, he was elected as a hereditary peer to membership in the House of Lords, as a member of the Conservative Party.

In 2013, he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and won the Julian L. Simon award in March 2012. In 2014, he won the free enterprise award from the Institute of Economic Affairs.

===Arms===
As Viscount Ridley, Ridley bears arms blazoned as &quot;Gules on a Chevron Argent between three Falcons proper, as many Pellets&quot;.

==Personal life==
When his father died in 2012, Ridley succeeded him as the 5th Viscount Ridley, having taken over the running of the family estate of Blagdon Hall, near Stannington, Northumberland, some years before.

In 1989, Ridley married Anya Hurlbert, a Professor of Neuroscience at Newcastle University; they live in northern England and have a son and a daughter.

In 1980, his sister Rose married the British Conservative Party politician Owen Paterson, who held the posts of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs until July 2014. During this time Ridley was described as &#x27;in many ways Paterson&#x27;s personal think tank&#x27;.

In 2015, Ridley&#x27;s team won the celebrity Christmas special of University Challenge representing Magdalen College, Oxford, the year after the team of his son, also Matthew, had won the student version representing Trinity College, Cambridge.

<text>In mathematics, matrix addition is the operation of adding two matrices by adding the corresponding entries together. 

For a vector, formula_1, adding two matrices would have the geometric effect of applying each matrix transformation separately onto formula_1, then adding the transformed vectors.

:formula_3

However, there are other operations that could also be considered addition for matrices, such as the direct sum and the Kronecker sum.

==Entrywise sum==
Two matrices must have an equal number of rows and columns to be added. In which case, the sum of two matrices A and B will be a matrix which has the same number of rows and columns as A and B. The sum of A and B, denoted , is computed by adding corresponding elements of A and B:

:formula_4
Or more concisely (assuming that ):
:formula_5

For example:

:formula_6

Similarly, it is also possible to subtract one matrix from another, as long as they have the same dimensions. The difference of A and B, denoted , is computed by subtracting elements of B from corresponding elements of A, and has the same dimensions as A and B. For example:

:formula_7

==Direct sum==
Another operation, which is used less often, is the direct sum (denoted by ⊕). The Kronecker sum is also denoted ⊕; the context should make the usage clear. The direct sum of any pair of matrices A of size &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; and B of size &quot;p&quot; × &quot;q&quot; is a matrix of size (&quot;m&quot; + &quot;p&quot;) × (&quot;n&quot; + &quot;q&quot;) defined as:

:formula_8

For instance,

:formula_9

The direct sum of matrices is a special type of block matrix. In particular, the direct sum of square matrices is a block diagonal matrix.

The adjacency matrix of the union of disjoint graphs (or multigraphs) is the direct sum of their adjacency matrices. Any element in the direct sum of two vector spaces of matrices can be represented as a direct sum of two matrices.

In general, the direct sum of &quot;n&quot; matrices is:
:formula_10

where the zeros are actually blocks of zeros (i.e., zero matrices).

==Kronecker sum==

The Kronecker sum is different from the direct sum, but is also denoted by ⊕. It is defined using the Kronecker product ⊗ and normal matrix addition. If A is &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot;, B is &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;m&quot; and formula_11 denotes the &quot;k&quot;-by-&quot;k&quot; identity matrix then the Kronecker sum is defined by:
:formula_12

<doc id="125277" wikidata="Q2296033" url="?curid=125277" title="USS Stark">
<text>USS &quot;Stark&quot; (FFG-31) was the 23rd ship of the of guided-missile frigates and was named after Admiral Harold Raynsford Stark (1880–1972). Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards in Seattle, Washington, on 23 January 1978, &quot;Stark&quot; was laid down on 24 August 1979, launched on 30 May 1980, and commissioned on 23 October 1982. In 1987, an Iraqi jet fired two missiles at &quot;Stark&quot;, killing 37 U.S. sailors on board. Decommissioned on 7 May 1999, &quot;Stark&quot; was scrapped in 2006.

==Missile attack==

USS &quot;Stark&quot; was deployed to the Middle East Force in 1984 and 1987. Captain Glenn R. Brindel was the commanding officer during the 1987 deployment. The ship was struck on 17 May 1987 by two Exocet anti-ship missiles during the Iran–Iraq War fired from an Iraqi aircraft officially identified as a Dassault Mirage F1 fighter, The Reagan administration attributed the blame to Iran for its alleged belligerence in the underlying conflict. The plane had taken off from Shaibah, Iraq at 20:00 and had flown south into the Persian Gulf. The pilot fired the first Exocet missile from a range of , and the second from , just about the time &quot;Stark&quot; issued a standard warning by radio. The frigate did not detect the missiles with radar; warning was given by the lookout only moments before the missiles struck. The first penetrated the port-side hull and failed to detonate, but left flaming rocket fuel in its path. The second entered at almost the same point, and, leaving a gash, exploded in crew quarters. The missiles killed 37 sailors and injured 21.
No weapons were fired in defense of &quot;Stark&quot;. The autonomous Phalanx CIWS remained in standby mode, Mark 36 SRBOC countermeasures were not armed until seconds before the missile hit. The attacking Exocet missiles and Mirage aircraft were in a blindspot of the STIR fire control director (Separate tracking and illumination Radar, part of the Mk 92 Guided Missile Fire Control System), and the Oto Melara Mk 75 76 mm/62 caliber naval gun, but in the clear for the MK 92 CAS (Combined Antenna System, primary search and tracking radar of the Mk 92 Guided Missile Fire Control System) and the Mk 13 Mod 4 single-arm launcher. The ship failed to maneuver to bring its Mk 75 to bear before the first missile hit.

On fire and listing, the frigate was brought under control by its crew during the night. The ship made its way to Bahrain where, after temporary repairs by the destroyer tender to make her seaworthy, she returned to her home port of Naval Station Mayport, under her own power. The ship was eventually repaired at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi for $142 million.
It is unknown whether Iraqi leaders authorized the attack. Initial claims by the Iraqi government that &quot;Stark&quot; was inside the Iran–Iraq War zone were shown to be false. The motives and orders of the pilot remain unanswered. American officials have claimed he was executed, but an ex-Iraqi Air Force commander later said that the pilot who attacked &quot;Stark&quot; was not punished, and remained alive. According to Jean-Louis Bernard, author of &quot;Heroes of Bagdad&quot; T1 (Editions JPO 2017), the pilot, Abdul Rhaman, not only was not punished, but would have received the medal of bravery at the end of &#x27;a joint Iraqi-American commission of inquiry. His subsequent defection is not mentioned in this book. Jean-Louis Bernard also confirms the use of a Falcon 50 during this action.
Citing lapses in training requirements and lax procedures, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s board of inquiry relieved Captain Brindel of command and recommended him for court-martial, along with tactical action officer Lieutenant Basil E. Moncrief. Instead, Brindel and Moncrief received non-judicial punishment from Admiral Frank B. Kelso II and letters of reprimand. Brindel opted for early retirement while Moncrief resigned his commission after only eight years of service. The executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Raymond Gajan Jr., was detached for cause and received a letter of admonition.

==1990s==
&quot;Stark&quot; was part of the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic Fleet in 1990 before returning to the Middle East Force in 1991. &quot;Stark&quot; was attached to UNITAS in 1993 and took part in Operation Uphold Democracy and Operation Able Vigil in 1994. In 1995, &quot;Stark&quot; returned to the Middle East Force before serving with the Standing Naval Forces, Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) in 1997 and in 1998.

&quot;Stark&quot; was decommissioned on 7 May 1999. A scrapping contract was awarded to Metro Machine Corp. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 7 October 2005. The ship was reported scrapped on 21 June 2006. Her stern plate was saved and donated to Naval Station Mayport.

<text>In mathematics, specifically in linear algebra, matrix multiplication is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices. For matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix, known as the matrix product, has the number of rows of the first and the number of columns of the second matrix. The product of matrices and is denoted as .

Matrix multiplication was first described by the French mathematician Jacques Philippe Marie Binet in 1812, to represent the composition of linear maps that are represented by matrices. Matrix multiplication is thus a basic tool of linear algebra, and as such has numerous applications in many areas of mathematics, as well as in applied mathematics, statistics, physics, economics, and engineering.
Computing matrix products is a central operation in all computational applications of linear algebra.

==Notation==
This article will use the following notational conventions: matrices are represented by capital letters in bold, e.g. ; vectors in lowercase bold, e.g. ; and entries of vectors and matrices are italic (they are numbers from a field), e.g. and . Index notation is often the clearest way to express definitions, and is used as standard in the literature. The entry in row , column of matrix is indicated by , or . In contrast, a single subscript, e.g. , is used to select a matrix (not a matrix entry) from a collection of matrices.

==Definitions==
===Matrix times matrix===
If is an matrix and is an matrix,
formula_1
the &quot;matrix product&quot; (denoted without multiplication signs or dots) is defined to be the matrix
formula_2
such that 
formula_3
for and .

That is, the entry of the product is obtained by multiplying term-by-term the entries of the th row of and the th column of , and summing these products. In other words, is the dot product of the th row of and the th column of .

Therefore, can also be written as
formula_4

Thus the product is defined if and only if the number of columns in equals the number of rows in , in this case .

In most scenarios, the entries are numbers, but they may be any kind of mathematical objects for which an addition and a multiplication are defined, that are associative, and such that the addition is commutative, and the multiplication is distributive with respect to the addition. In particular, the entries may be matrices themselves (see block matrix).

===Matrix times vector===
A vector formula_5 of length formula_6 can be viewed as a column vector, corresponding to an formula_7 matrix formula_8 whose entries are given by formula_9 If formula_10 is an formula_11 matrix, the matrix-times-vector product denoted by formula_12 is then the vector formula_13 that, viewed as a column vector, is equal to the formula_14 matrix formula_15 In index notation, this amounts to:
:formula_16
One way of looking at this is that the changes from &quot;plain&quot; vector to column vector and back are assumed and left implicit.

===Vector times matrix===
Similarly, a vector formula_5 of length formula_6 can be viewed as a row vector, corresponding to a formula_19 matrix. To make it clear that a row vector is meant, it is customary in this context to represent it as the transpose of a column vector; thus, one will see notations such as formula_20 The identity formula_21 holds. In index notation, if formula_10 is an formula_23 matrix, formula_24 amounts to:
formula_25

===Vector times vector===
The dot product formula_26 of two vectors formula_27 and formula_28 of equal length is equal to the single entry of the formula_29 matrix resulting from multiplying these vectors as a row and a column vector, thus: formula_30 (or formula_31 which results in the same formula_29 matrix).

===Illustration===
The figure to the right illustrates diagrammatically the product of two matrices and , showing how each intersection in the product matrix corresponds to a row of and a column of .
formula_33

The values at the intersections, marked with circles in figure to the right, are:
formula_34

==Fundamental applications==
Historically, matrix multiplication has been introduced for facilitating and clarifying computations in linear algebra. This strong relationship between matrix multiplication and linear algebra remains fundamental in all mathematics, as well as in physics, chemistry, engineering and computer science.

===Linear maps===
If a vector space has a finite basis, its vectors are each uniquely represented by a finite sequence of scalars, called a coordinate vector, whose elements are the coordinates of the vector on the basis. These coordinate vectors form another vector space, which is isomorphic to the original vector space. A coordinate vector is commonly organized as a column matrix (also called a &quot;column vector&quot;), which is a matrix with only one column. So, a column vector represents both a coordinate vector, and a vector of the original vector space.

A linear map from a vector space of dimension into a vector space of dimension maps a column vector
:formula_35
onto the column vector
:formula_36
The linear map is thus defined by the matrix 
:formula_37
and maps the column vector formula_5 to the matrix product 
:formula_39

If is another linear map from the preceding vector space of dimension , into a vector space of dimension , it is represented by a matrix formula_40 A straightforward computation shows that the matrix of the composite map is the matrix product formula_41 The general formula ) that defines the function composition is instanced here as a specific case of associativity of matrix product (see below):
:formula_42

====Geometric rotations====

Using a Cartesian coordinate system in a Euclidean plane, the rotation by an angle formula_43 around the origin is a linear map.
More precisely, 
formula_44
where the source point formula_45 and its image formula_46 are written as column vectors.

The composition of the rotation by formula_43 and that by formula_48 then corresponds to the matrix product
formula_49
where appropriate trigonometric identities are employed for the second equality.
That is, the composition corresponds to the rotation by angle formula_50, as expected.

====Resource allocation in economics====

As an example, a fictitious factory uses 4 kinds of basic commodities, formula_51 to produce 3 kinds of intermediate goods, formula_52, which in turn are used to produce 3 kinds of final products, formula_53. The matrices 
:formula_54   and   formula_55
provide the amount of basic commodities needed for a given amount of intermediate goods, and the amount of intermediate goods needed for a given amount of final products, respectively.
For example, to produce one unit of intermediate good formula_56, one unit of basic commodity formula_57, two units of formula_58, no units of formula_59, and one unit of formula_60 are needed, corresponding to the first column of formula_61.

Using matrix multiplication, compute 
:formula_62
this matrix directly provides the amounts of basic commodities needed for given amounts of final goods. For example, the bottom left entry of formula_63 is computed as formula_64, reflecting that formula_65 units of formula_60 are needed to produce one unit of formula_67. Indeed, one formula_60 unit is needed for formula_56, one for each of two formula_70, and formula_71 for each of the four formula_72 units that go into the formula_67 unit, see picture.

In order to produce e.g. 100 units of the final product formula_67, 80 units of formula_75, and 60 units of formula_76, the necessary amounts of basic goods can be computed as
:formula_77
that is, formula_78 units of formula_57, formula_80 units of formula_58, formula_82 units of formula_59, formula_84 units of formula_60 are needed.
Similarly, the product matrix formula_63 can be used to compute the needed amounts of basic goods for other final-good amount data.

===System of linear equations===
The general form of a system of linear equations is
:formula_87

Using same notation as above, such a system is equivalent with the single matrix equation
:formula_88

===Dot product, bilinear form and sesquilinear form===
The dot product of two column vectors is the unique entry of the matrix product 
:formula_89
where formula_90 is the row vector obtained by transposing formula_5. (As usual, a 1×1 matrix is identified with its unique entry.)

More generally, any bilinear form over a vector space of finite dimension may be expressed as a matrix product
:formula_92
and any sesquilinear form may be expressed as 
:formula_93
where formula_94 denotes the conjugate transpose of formula_5 (conjugate of the transpose, or equivalently transpose of the conjugate).

==General properties==
Matrix multiplication shares some properties with usual multiplication. However, matrix multiplication is not defined if the number of columns of the first factor differs from the number of rows of the second factor, and it is non-commutative, even when the product remains defined after changing the order of the factors.

===Non-commutativity===
An operation is commutative if, given two elements and such that the product formula_96 is defined, then formula_97 is also defined, and formula_98

If and are matrices of respective sizes and , then formula_96 is defined if , and formula_97 is defined if . Therefore, if one of the products is defined, the other one need not be defined. If , the two products are defined, but have different sizes; thus they cannot be equal. Only if , that is, if and are square matrices of the same size, are both products defined and of the same size. Even in this case, one has in general
:formula_101 
For example
:formula_102
but
:formula_103

This example may be expanded for showing that, if is a matrix with entries in a field , then formula_104 for every matrix with entries in , if and only if formula_105 where , and is the identity matrix. If, instead of a field, the entries are supposed to belong to a ring, then one must add the condition that belongs to the center of the ring.

One special case where commutativity does occur is when and are two (square) diagonal matrices (of the same size); then . Again, if the matrices are over a general ring rather than a field, the corresponding entries in each must also commute with each other for this to hold.

===Distributivity===
The matrix product is distributive with respect to matrix addition. That is, if are matrices of respective sizes , , , and , one has (left distributivity)
:formula_106
and (right distributivity)
:formula_107

This results from the distributivity for coefficients by 
:formula_108
:formula_109

===Product with a scalar===
If is a matrix and a scalar, then the matrices formula_110 and formula_111 are obtained by left or right multiplying all entries of by . If the scalars have the commutative property, then formula_112

If the product formula_63 is defined (that is, the number of columns of equals the number of rows of ), then 
:formula_114 and formula_115
If the scalars have the commutative property, then all four matrices are equal. More generally, all four are equal if belongs to the center of a ring containing the entries of the matrices, because in this case, for all matrices .

These properties result from the bilinearity of the product of scalars:
:formula_116
:formula_117

===Transpose===
If the scalars have the commutative property, the transpose of a product of matrices is the product, in the reverse order, of the transposes of the factors. That is 
:formula_118
where T denotes the transpose, that is the interchange of rows and columns.

This identity does not hold for noncommutative entries, since the order between the entries of and is reversed, when one expands the definition of the matrix product.

===Complex conjugate===
If and have complex entries, then
:formula_119
where denotes the entry-wise complex conjugate of a matrix.

This results from applying to the definition of matrix product the fact that the conjugate of a sum is the sum of the conjugates of the summands and the conjugate of a product is the product of the conjugates of the factors.

Transposition acts on the indices of the entries, while conjugation acts independently on the entries themselves. It results that, if and have complex entries, one has

:formula_120

where denotes the conjugate transpose (conjugate of the transpose, or equivalently transpose of the conjugate).

===Associativity===
Given three matrices and , the products and are defined if and only if the number of columns of equals the number of rows of , and the number of columns of equals the number of rows of (in particular, if one of the products is defined, then the other is also defined). In this case, one has the associative property
:formula_121

As for any associative operation, this allows omitting parentheses, and writing the above products as 

This extends naturally to the product of any number of matrices provided that the dimensions match. That is, if are matrices such that the number of columns of equals the number of rows of for , then the product 
:formula_122
is defined and does not depend on the order of the multiplications, if the order of the matrices is kept fixed.

These properties may be proved by straightforward but complicated summation manipulations. This result also follows from the fact that matrices represent linear maps. Therefore, the associative property of matrices is simply a specific case of the associative property of function composition.

====Computational complexity depends on parenthesization====
Although the result of a sequence of matrix products does not depend on the order of operation (provided that the order of the matrices is not changed), the computational complexity may depend dramatically on this order.

For example, if and are matrices of respective sizes , computing needs multiplications, while computing needs multiplications.

Algorithms have been designed for choosing the best order of products; see Matrix chain multiplication. When the number of matrices increases, it has been shown that the choice of the best order has a complexity of formula_123

====Application to similarity====
Any invertible matrix formula_124 defines a similarity transformation (on square matrices of the same size as formula_124)
:formula_126

Similarity transformations map product to products, that is 
:formula_127

In fact, one has 
:formula_128

==Square matrices==
Let us denote formula_129 the set of square matrices with entries in a ring , which, in practice, is often a field.

In formula_129, the product is defined for every pair of matrices. This makes formula_129 a ring, which has the identity matrix as identity element (the matrix whose diagonal entries are equal to 1 and all other entries are 0). This ring is also an associative -algebra.

If , many matrices do not have a multiplicative inverse. For example, a matrix such that all entries of a row (or a column) are 0 does not have an inverse. If it exists, the inverse of a matrix is denoted , and, thus verifies
:formula_132
A matrix that has an inverse is an invertible matrix. Otherwise, it is a singular matrix.

A product of matrices is invertible if and only if each factor is invertible. In this case, one has

:formula_133

When is commutative, and, in particular, when it is a field, the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants. As determinants are scalars, and scalars commute, one has thus 
:formula_134

The other matrix invariants do not behave as well with products. Nevertheless, if is commutative, and have the same trace, the same characteristic polynomial, and the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicities. However, the eigenvectors are generally different if .

===Powers of a matrix===
One may raise a square matrix to any nonnegative integer power multiplying it by itself repeatedly in the same way as for ordinary numbers. That is,
:formula_135
:formula_136
:formula_137

Computing the th power of a matrix needs times the time of a single matrix multiplication, if it is done with the trivial algorithm (repeated multiplication). As this may be very time consuming, one generally prefers using exponentiation by squaring, which requires less than matrix multiplications, and is therefore much more efficient.

An easy case for exponentiation is that of a diagonal matrix. Since the product of diagonal matrices amounts to simply multiplying corresponding diagonal elements together, the th power of a diagonal matrix is obtained by raising the entries to the power :
:formula_138

==Abstract algebra==
The definition of matrix product requires that the entries belong to a semiring, and does not require multiplication of elements of the semiring to be commutative. In many applications, the matrix elements belong to a field, although the tropical semiring is also a common choice for graph shortest path problems. Even in the case of matrices over fields, the product is not commutative in general, although it is associative and is distributive over matrix addition. The identity matrices (which are the square matrices whose entries are zero outside of the main diagonal and 1 on the main diagonal) are identity elements of the matrix product. It follows that the matrices over a ring form a ring, which is noncommutative except if and the ground ring is commutative.

A square matrix may have a multiplicative inverse, called an inverse matrix. In the common case where the entries belong to a commutative ring , a matrix has an inverse if and only if its determinant has a multiplicative inverse in . The determinant of a product of square matrices is the product of the determinants of the factors. The matrices that have an inverse form a group under matrix multiplication, the subgroups of which are called matrix groups. Many classical groups (including all finite groups) are isomorphic to matrix groups; this is the starting point of the theory of group representations.

Matrices are the morphisms of a category, the category of matrices. The objects are the natural numbers that measure the size of matrices, and the composition of morphisms is matrix multiplication. The source of a morphism is the number of columns of the corresponding matrix, and the target is the number of rows.

==Computational complexity==


The matrix multiplication algorithm that results from the definition requires, in the worst case, multiplications and additions of scalars to compute the product of two square matrices. Its computational complexity is therefore , in a model of computation for which the scalar operations take constant time.

Rather surprisingly, this complexity is not optimal, as shown in 1969 by Volker Strassen, who provided an algorithm, now called Strassen&#x27;s algorithm, with a complexity of formula_139
Strassen&#x27;s algorithm can be parallelized to further improve the performance.
, the best peer-reviewed matrix multiplication algorithm is by Virginia Vassilevska Williams, Yinzhan Xu, Zixuan Xu, and Renfei Zhou and has complexity .
It is not known whether matrix multiplication can be performed in time. This would be optimal, since one must read the elements of a matrix in order to multiply it with another matrix.

Since matrix multiplication forms the basis for many algorithms, and many operations on matrices even have the same complexity as matrix multiplication (up to a multiplicative constant), the computational complexity of matrix multiplication appears throughout numerical linear algebra and theoretical computer science.

==Generalizations==
Other types of products of matrices include:
* Block matrix operations
* Cracovian product, defined as 
* Frobenius inner product, the dot product of matrices considered as vectors, or, equivalently the sum of the entries of the Hadamard product
* Hadamard product of two matrices of the same size, resulting in a matrix of the same size, which is the product entry-by-entry
* Kronecker product or tensor product, the generalization to any size of the preceding 
* Khatri–Rao product and face-splitting product
* Outer product, also called dyadic product or tensor product of two column matrices, which is formula_140
* Scalar multiplication

<text>Kanuri () is a Saharan dialect continuum of the Nilo–Saharan language family spoken by the Kanuri and Kanembu peoples in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, as well as by a diaspora community residing in Sudan.

==Background==
At the turn of the 21st century, its two main dialects, Manga Kanuri and Yerwa Kanuri (also called Beriberi, which its speakers consider to be pejorative), were spoken by 9,700,000 people in Central Africa. It belongs to the Western Saharan subphylum of Nilo-Saharan. Kanuri is the language associated with the Kanem and Bornu empires that dominated the Lake Chad region for a thousand years.

The basic word order of Kanuri sentences is subject–object–verb. It is typologically unusual in simultaneously having postpositions and post-nominal modifiers – for example, &#x27;Bintu&#x27;s pot&#x27; would be expressed as , &#x27;pot Bintu-of&#x27;.

Kanuri has three tones: high, low, and falling. It has an extensive system of consonantal lenition; for example, &#x27;they&#x27; + &#x27;have eaten&#x27; → &#x27;they have eaten&#x27;.

Traditionally a local lingua franca, its usage has declined in recent decades. Most first-language speakers speak Hausa or Arabic as a second language.

==Geographic distribution==
Kanuri is spoken mainly in lowlands of the Chad Basin, with speakers in Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan and Libya.
===By country===
====Nigeria====
The Kanuri region in Nigeria consists of Borno State and Yobe State. Some other states such as Jigawa, Gombe and Bauchi are also dominated by Kanuri people, but they are not included in this region. Cities and towns where Kanuri is spoken include Maiduguri, Damaturu, Hadejia, Akko, Duku, Kwami, Kano, Kaduna, Gusau, Jos and Lafia.

In central Nigeria, the Kanuri are usually referred to as Bare-Bari or Beriberi.

Central Kanuri, also known as Yerwa Kanuri, is the main language of the Kanuri people living in Borno State, Yobe State and Gombe State, and it is usually referred to as &quot;Kanuri&quot; in Nigeria.

Manga Kanuri, which is the main language of the Kanuri people in Yobe State, Jigawa State and Bauchi State, is usually referred to as &quot;Manga&quot; or &quot;Mangari&quot; or &quot;Mangawa&quot;, and they are distinct from the &quot;Kanuri&quot;, which is a term generally used for speakers of Central Kanuri.

The Kanembu language is also spoken in Borno State on the border with Chad.

====Niger====
In Niger, the Kanuri region is composed of Diffa Region and Zinder Region in the southeast. Parts of Agadez Region are also Kanuri. Cities where it is spoken include Zinder, Diffa, N&#x27;Guigmi and Bilma.

In Zinder region, the main dialect is Manga. In Diffa Region, the main dialect is Tumari or Kanembu; Kanembu is spoken by a minority. In Agadez Region, the main dialect is Bilma. Central Kanuri is a minority dialect, and is commonly referred to as Bare-Bari or Beriberi.

==Varieties==
&quot; Ethnologue&quot; divides Kanuri into the following languages, while many linguists (e.g. Cyffer 1998) regard them as dialects of a single language. The first three are spoken by ethnic Kanuri and thought by them as dialects of their language.

*Central Kanuri
*Manga Kanuri
*Tumari Kanuri
*Bilma Kanuri (or Bilms)
*Kanembu

The variety attested in 17th-century Qur&#x27;anic glosses is known as Old Kanembu. In the context of religious recitation and commentaries, a heavily archaizing descendant of this is still used, called Tarjumo.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
* There may also exist prenasalized voiced stop consonant sounds , although it is not known whether they are considered phonemic.
* The sound occurs mainly as an allophone of , when following another voiceless plosive. It also may be in free alteration with ; however, it is still represented in the standard Kanuri orthography.
* A voiceless fricative occurs as an allophone of when preceding back vowels . A voiced fricative occurs as an allophone of , when occurring in intervocalic positions. A voiced fricative occurs as an allophone of , when occurring intervocalically between central vowels.
* A retroflex lateral sound is heard when is followed by .
* occurs as an allophone of when preceding velar stop consonants. Often, the stop sounds are deleted or misheard, so just the nasal sound is mainly heard.

=== Vowels ===
* is heard as an allophone of .

==Written Kanuri==
Kanuri has been written using the Ajami Arabic script, mainly in religious or court contexts, for at least four hundred years. More recently, it is also sometimes written in a modified Latin script. The Gospel of John published in 1965 was produced in Roman and Arabic script.

===Alphabet===
A standardized romanized orthography (known as the Standard Kanuri Orthography in Nigeria) was developed by the Kanuri Research Unit and the Kanuri Language Board. Its elaboration, based on the dialect of Maiduguri, was carried out by the Orthography Committee of the Kanuri Language Board, under the Chairmanship of Abba Sadiq, Waziri of Borno. It was officially approved by the Kanuri Language Board in Maiduguri, Nigeria, in 1975.

==Oral literature==

In 1854, Sigismund Koelle published &quot;African Native Literature, or Proverbs, Tales, Fables, and Historical Fragments in the Kanuri or Bornu Language&quot; which contains texts in Kanuri and in English translation. There is a selection of proverbs,
stories and fables,
and historical fragments. In his English translation, Koelle misidentifies the trickster ground-squirrel, &quot;kə̀nyérì&quot;, as a weasel.

Richard Francis Burton in his &quot;Wit and Wisdom from West Africa&quot; included a selection of the proverbs reported by Koelle. Here are some of those proverbs:
*&quot;Angalte silman gani karga, kalalan karga.&quot; &quot;Wisdom is not in the eye, but in the head.&quot; (#5)
*&quot;Tama sugo diniabe.&quot; &quot;Hope is the pillar of the world.&quot; (#16)
*&quot;Ago fugubete, komande genya, ngudo dabu kuruguamai tsurui bago.&quot; &quot;As to what is future, even a bird with a long neck cannot see it, but the Lord only.&quot; (#32)
*&quot;Bulturo dinia watsi tsabalan.&quot; &quot;It became day whilst the hyena was on its way (i.e. the man&#x27;s strength was broken before he attained his object).&quot; (#41)
*&quot;Ngurtu kamawunga da tsogo tilon kotsena, kamawun gurtuga sila tsogo tilon kotsena.&quot; &quot;A hippopotamus exceeds an elephant by one basket of flesh, and an elephant exceeds a hippopotamus by one basket of bones.&quot; (#78)

<doc id="125290" wikidata="Q6316813" url="?curid=125290" title="Name of the Spanish language">
<text>The Spanish language has two names: () and (). Spanish speakers from different countries or backgrounds can show a preference for one term or the other, or use them indiscriminately, but political issues or common usage might lead speakers to prefer one term over the other. This article identifies the differences between those terms, the countries or backgrounds that show a preference for one or the other, and the implications the choice of words might have for a native Spanish speaker.

Formally speaking, the national language of Spain, the official Spanish language, is the Castilian language (as opposed to the regional languages of Spain, such as Galician, Catalan, Asturleonese, and Basque). As such both names, &quot;español&quot; and &quot;castellano&quot;, have distinct and independent meanings that may be required for clarity in some specific contexts.
Generally speaking, though, both terms can be used to refer to the (national) Spanish language as a whole, with a preference for one over the other that depends on the context or the speaker&#x27;s origin. &quot;Castellano&quot; (as well as &quot;Castilian&quot; in English) has another, more restricted, meaning, relating either to the old Romance language spoken in the Kingdom of Castile in the Middle Ages, predecessor of the modern Spanish language, or to the variety of Spanish nowadays spoken in the historical region of Castile, in central Spain.

==History of the terms==
Originally &quot;Castilian (castellano)&quot; referred to the language of the Kingdom of Castile, one of several northern kingdoms that spread across the Iberian Peninsula through the Middle Ages, from about the 8th to the 15th centuries. Traditionally the first recorded examples of written Castilian/Spanish are considered to be the &quot;Glosas Emilianenses&quot;, a number of isolated words added to a Latin text as an aid to the reader, dated to the eleventh century. Soon after that there begin to appear discursive texts in Castilian, such as the &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot;. This early Romance language was derived from Latin and evolved into modern Spanish.

However, the term &quot;Spanish&quot; (&quot;español&quot;) is a more recent term that first referred to Spain as a country, and then to the predominant language spoken in that country. Spain as a truly unified nation appeared centuries later than the language and the Kingdom of Castile; in fact, it was only in the late 15th century that the personal union between the Crowns of Castile and Aragon unified Spain. The actual legal unification date is disputed, but commonly agreed to have occurred not earlier than the eighteenth century at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Only then did the Castilian language begin to be commonly called Spanish.

In 1492, the arrival of Christopher Columbus on a Castilian-paid expedition paved the way for the Spanish colonization of the Americas. As a result of this process, most countries in South America now speak the same language as Castile. Until about the eighteenth century, the Kingdom of Castile, and not Spain as a whole, was the colonizing power, and the language used was called &quot;castellano&quot;. Thus, some Latin American countries formerly under Spanish rule have retained the custom of calling it &quot;castellano&quot;, while others eventually switched to calling it &quot;español&quot;, with many different factors influencing the final choice.

In English, the term &quot;Spanish&quot; relates both to the language and to the nation. The noun used for a person from Spain is &quot;Spaniard&quot;, with the collective noun &quot;the Spanish&quot;. The term &quot;Castilian&quot; is much less widespread amongst English speakers than the term &quot;Spanish&quot;.

===&quot;Español&quot;===
Two main hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the word &quot;español&quot;: one based on dissimilation in Old Spanish &quot;españón&quot; (from a presumed Vulgar Latin *&quot;hispaniōne&quot;), and the other on an Occitan term derived from a presumed Vulgar Latin *&quot;hispaniolus&quot;. Both Latin ancestor words are based on the place name &quot;Hispania&quot; (which evolved into &quot;España&quot; by regular sound changes); and both are marked with an asterisk to indicate that they are reconstructed, not directly attested.

The dissimilation hypothesis, advanced by Ramón Menéndez Pidal, presumes that Latin &quot;Hispania&quot; was lengthened by the derivational suffix &quot;-ōne&quot; (which survives in other ethnonyms such as &quot;bretón&quot;, &quot;borgoñón&quot;, &quot;sajón&quot;, and &quot;lapón&quot;). The Old Spanish form &quot;españon&quot; is documented in works of the 13th and 14th centuries. It is suggested that the final /n/ of this form changed to /l/ by dissimilation from the previous nasal consonant, &quot;ñ&quot;. This sporadic sound change is observed in some other words: Menéndez Pidal cites &quot;Barcelona&quot; (from &quot;Barcinone&quot;) and &quot;delante&quot; (from &quot;de in ante&quot;); Lathrop adds &quot;ingle&quot; (from &quot;ing[ui]ne&quot;) and &quot;sangre&quot; (from &quot;sang[ui]ne&quot;).

According to the Occitan scenario, advanced by Rafael Lapesa, the Spanish borrowed the Occitan name for themselves, which was the name &quot;España&quot; plus the diminutive suffix &quot;-ol&quot;, from the Latin &quot;-olus&quot;. The Occitan influence is inferred because in Castilian the same Latin suffix would have produced *&quot;españuelo&quot; rather than &quot;español&quot;. Lapesa counters the dissimilation hypothesis by citing other words with &quot;-ñón&quot; in which dissimilation did not take place: &quot;cañón&quot;, &quot;borgoñón&quot;, &quot;riñón&quot;, etc. (However, the suffix could have been restored analogically in these, or they were formed after the dissimilation took place.) Penny, in discussing loans from French and Occitan, calls this &quot;the most remarkable loan of all, &quot;español&quot; &#x27;Spanish&#x27;, replacing native &quot;españón&quot;.&quot;

The name &quot;Hispania&quot; was applied to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans when they discovered and later subjugated it. One theory about this name is that it comes from Canaanite אי שפנים (&quot;ʾî šəpānîm&quot;), meaning &#x27;island of hyraxes&#x27;, named by Canaanite-speaking Phoenicians who mistook Spain&#x27;s large rabbit population for hyraxes. Several other theories about the name have been advanced as well (see Hispania).

The Romans called the inhabitants of Hispania &quot;hispani&quot; (singular: &quot;hispanus&quot;), and the relevant adjective was &quot;hispanicus&quot;. These terms, had they undergone regular sound change into Castilian, would have developed into &quot;España&quot;, *&quot;espanos&quot; (singular: *&quot;espano&quot;) and *&quot;espánego&quot; or *&quot;espango&quot;—but in reality, only the first term exists in modern Castilian.

As the branches of Vulgar Latin began to evolve into separate Romance languages, the term that would evolve into &quot;español&quot; began to be used to refer to these derivative languages (especially as opposed to the Arabic and Hebrew of the Moorish and Jewish inhabitants of Iberia). It was at first a general term that embraced the various dialects of Iberian Romance spoken in the area, including the forebears of modern Portuguese, Galician, Castilian and Catalan. However, with the rise of Castile as a power, and its absorption of all surrounding regions into an ever-growing empire that eventually spread to the New World, the term &quot;España&quot; was eventually equated with the peninsular territories ruled by the Crown. With this, the break with the Roman concept of &quot;Hispania&quot; was complete, and the term acquired its modern meaning of &#x27;all of Iberia except for Portugal and Andorra&#x27;. Similarly, &quot;español&quot; came to be used to refer to the common language of this new country: Castilian.

The terms &quot;España&quot; and &quot;español&quot; spread to other languages. The English name &quot;Spain&quot; is from the French &quot;Espagne&quot;. &quot;Spanish&quot; is &quot;Spain&quot; plus the English suffix &quot;-ish&quot;. The term continues evolving as other languages adapt these words to form their own name for Spain—for example, Japanese スペイン語 (&quot;Supein-go&quot;), &#x27;Spanish language&#x27;, and スペイン人 (&quot;Supein-jin&quot;), &#x27;Spaniard&#x27;, derive from the Japanese word for Spain, スペイン (&quot;Supein&quot;), which, in turn, derives from English &quot;Spain&quot;. In Chinese, the word is taken directly from Spanish (or perhaps even Latin) rather than English: 西班牙 ( &quot;xībānyá&quot;) for Spain and 西班牙语 ( &quot;xībānyá yǔ&quot;), or the abbreviation 西語 ( &quot;xī yǔ&quot;) for the Spanish language. The Arabic إسبانية (&quot;isbāniya&quot;) for Spain derives directly from the word &quot;Hispania&quot; (noting that the absence of &quot;p&quot; in the Arabic alphabet makes it a &quot;b&quot;).

 (&quot;Castile&quot; in English) is commonly thought to mean &#x27;Castle-land&#x27;. The word is derived from Latin , the plural of , which, in turn, is a diminutive form of &#x27; &#x27;fortress, castle&#x27;. Through most of the Middle Ages the word was spelled , a form that survives in Leonese today. (Modern Spanish has transformed all words ending in , into , .) The adjective derived from is . also means &#x27;castellan&#x27;, i.e. a castle master. There is a comic scene based on the play on words &quot;Castilian&quot;/&quot;castellan&quot; in the novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (Chapter 2).

The region was thus named because it was a frontier land controlled from a series of fortified castles. It shared borders with rival Moorish Iberia (to the south) and the Christian kingdoms of Leon (to the west) and Navarre and Aragon (to the east).

In Guatemala, although Spanish is the official language, the Maya peoples, descendants of the original inhabitants of the region, call it &quot;la castilla&quot;, keeping the original name from colonial times. Mayans speak at least 22 different Mayan languages and dialects, including Mam, Pocomam, Kaqchikel, Tz’utujil, Q’eqchi’, and Kʼicheʼ.

===Other local names===
====&quot;Cristiano&quot;====

During the presence of Moors in Hispania, Spanish was sometimes given the name &quot;cristiano&quot; (&quot;Christian&quot;) to distinguish it from the Arabic and Hebrew languages - although the language spoken by Christians under Islamic rule was Mozarabic (of which Aragonese is actually the closest living language). This term is still used occasionally today to refer to the language, in a jocular tone.
The expression &quot;Háblame en cristiano&quot; &quot;talk to me in Christian&quot;, said to people not speaking Spanish at the moment, is used in opposition of the other languages of Spain, (Catalan, Galician, Basque, as well as others such as Asturian or Aragonese), to the chagrin of the speakers of these languages. The phrase is not used in the Americas. &quot;Háblame en cristiano&quot; is also a phrase used to ask for clarification in a conversation, when the topic of the discussion is not clear or is vaguely hinted at by one of the speakers.

====&quot;Language of Cervantes&quot;====
The term as an epithet for the Spanish language began to be used early in the 19th century. Mariano José de Larra uses the expression in his essay , first published in 1823. In 1829 it appears in , by Manuel Sivela. Soon after that it appears in an anonymous article in the . The poet Nicasio Camilo Jover, in his poem , states directly Spanish is called in a book published in 1830, and in another one published in 1838.

Occasionally the term refers to the language of Spanish Golden Age literature generally, rather than simply to that of Cervantes.

&quot;The language of Cervantes&quot; in English—as a term for the Spanish language generally—comes into use in the 1840s. Examples appear in Janin (1841) and Campbell (1849).

While quotations and expressions from Cervantes&#x27; work are still in use, the actual language and spelling that Cervantes used can sound archaic to modern readers.
Modern editions may modernize it to appeal the current public.

====&quot;Román paladino&quot;====
The poet Gonzalo de Berceo, writing in the 13th century, used the phrase to mean simple, straightforward language, the language spoken by the common people, as opposed to Latin. In the famous passage from his , Berceo says (&quot;I want to write verse [sic] in clear vernacular, in which the townsfolk speak to their neighbor; for I&#x27;m not so learned as to make another in Latin. It will be worth, I think, a glass of good wine&quot;). —and, more frequently (and later )—was used in medieval Spanish as a synonym of , i.e. the language now commonly called Old Spanish. And meant—in Berceo&#x27;s time the same as it does today—&quot;public, clear, obvious&quot;. (Old Spanish existed alongside its learned cognate , which usually referred to the Palatine Hill of Rome. Both words are derived ultimately from Latin &quot;of the palace&quot;, with influence from Latin &quot;openly&quot;.) Today is a high-sounding epithet for clear, straightforward Spanish. Recently it has been popularized in public speeches by Spain&#x27;s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has used it frequently as an equivalent for &quot;I will clearly state...&quot;

==Royal Spanish Academy==
In Spain, the Royal Spanish Academy is a normative body that rules on the orthography and general usage rules of the language. The Academy has used &quot;castellano&quot; since the 18th century, but since 1923, its dictionary and grammar are &quot;de la lengua española&quot; (&quot;of the Spanish language&quot;). The Academy&#x27;s usage of one term is not necessarily a condemnation of the other.

There are many other academies (grouped under the Association of Spanish Language Academies) that may or may not have an official normative recognition but nevertheless cooperate in the creation of the &quot;Diccionario panhispánico de dudas&quot; (a compendium of corrected typical mistakes and doubts). The dictionary, whose production was agreed upon by the 22 different Spanish Language Academies, says:

Thus, even if both terms are allowed in Spanish, the use of &quot;español&quot; is recommended for the language as a whole. However, popular choice of terms is not so clear, with other factors, such as customs or geographical location, being factors.

==Usage in Spain==
Spaniards tend to call the language &quot;español&quot; (Spanish) to contrast it to languages of other states, such as in a list with French (&quot;francés&quot;), German (&quot;alemán&quot;), etc. &quot;Castellano&quot; (Castilian) by contrast, is more often used when contrasting the language with other regional languages of Spain: official languages like Basque, Catalan and Galician or unofficial ones like Aragonese, Asturian, Extremaduran and Leonese. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term &quot;el castellano&quot; to define the official language of the whole State, opposed to &quot;las demás lenguas españolas&quot; (&quot;the other Spanish languages&quot;). Article 3 reads in part:

This choice of words, however, varies depending on many factors, including the origin of the speaker or some political nuances.

===Bilingual and multilingual regions of Spain===
In the regions where regional languages are spoken, there is a daily need to make the contrast between the national language and the regional language and so the national language is most often referred to as Castilian, particularly in the regional languages themselves (for example, &quot;espanyol&quot; is virtually never used to refer to the language in Catalan: &quot;castellà&quot; is used instead; in Basque, the name of the language is &quot;gaztelania&quot; or &quot;gaztelera&quot;, rather than &quot;espainiera&quot;; and in Galician, the most commonly used term is &quot;castelán&quot; rather than &quot;español&quot;). That is often mirrored by educated English-speakers to refer to the linguistic situation in Spain.

For some, this use of the term &quot;castellano&quot; is a political or cultural statement that Spanish is only the language of Castile, perhaps also of some areas that Castile colonised, but not the language of their region, which they consider the only legitimate language to be the regional one: Catalan, Basque, Galician etc. That stance is common in regionalist circles.

Conversely, some nationalist circles prefer the term &quot;español&quot; because they perceive their ethnic community to be distinct from that of Spain and therefore do not object to the language of Spain being called Spanish. In Basque-speaking regions, whose language is not of Romance origin (Basque is considered by many scholars to be a language isolate), some Basque speakers also use the term &quot;erdara&quot; or &quot;erdera&quot; (&quot;foreign&quot;) specifically for Spanish, since for them, it is the prevalent foreign language, just as in the French Basque Country, &quot;French language&quot; is the usual meaning of &quot;erdara&quot;; in fact, &quot;erdara&quot; is another language, different from Basque.

===Monolingual regions of Spain===
In monolingual regions, the implications are a little different. In such regions, there is no identity implication, but still, they must choose one of the two terms. Castilians usually use the term &quot;el español&quot;, legitimately presenting it as the national language. However, they also frequently call it &quot;el castellano&quot;, either to assert their ownership or to distinguish it from the regional languages.

Monolingual regions outside of Castile include mainly Andalusia but also other regions where the regional languages are not developed enough to be widely spoken by the majority of the population, such as Extremadura, Cantabria or Aragon. There, &quot;español&quot; may be used, as in Castile, to stress the national nature of the language but with a slightly different nuance: they are accepting another region&#x27;s historical language as their own.

===Concept of a standard===
The term &quot;castellano&quot; is occasionally used to imply more of a standard form than &quot;español&quot; does. For example, if someone mispronounces a word, they might be told &quot;¡Habla castellano!&quot;, i.e. &#x27;Speak Castilian!&#x27;, &#x27;Speak properly!&#x27;. However, that nuance is not to be exaggerated, as it is perfectly possible that the term &quot;español&quot; or even, jocularly, &quot;cristiano&quot; (&#x27;Christian&#x27;) could be used instead. Moreover, the term &quot;castellano&quot; is also commonly and correctly used to refer to dialects of Spanish, which deviate dramatically from the standard.

==Usage and implications in former colonies==
Both names are commonly used in parts of the world colonized by Spanish speakers, such as Latin America and the Canary Islands. As in Spain, the implications are complex. The most common term used in Latin America is &quot;español&quot;, generally considered to be a neutral term simply reflecting the country that the language came from. For people who use that term, &quot;castellano&quot; may possibly imply greater correctness, as it sometimes does in Spain, or it may merely be an alien term, referring to a region in a far-off country. The residents of Canary Islands usually call their language &quot;español&quot;, while Canary Islands is politically part of Spain. This is because Canary Islands are miles away from mainland Spain; in all areas of Spain, Canary Islands is the only area in Spain wherein the language is only called &quot;español&quot; and not &quot;castellano.&quot;

However, some Latin Americans prefer the term &quot;castellano&quot;, especially in Argentina, Chile, and Peru. One reason for this is that many early Argentine settlers were Galician, for whom &quot;castellano&quot; had long been associated with the Spanish state in addition to Castile. Along with Basques or Catalans, Galicians might perceive the term &quot;español&quot; as imperialistic and misrepresenting the language of Castile as the language of Spain.

In Chile, the term &quot;castellano&quot; has historically been popular mainly because this was the term introduced by the Spanish themselves during colonial times, and continued to be the more common term used by Chileans until the 1970s. With the widespread introduction of &quot;español&quot; to refer to the Spanish language via TV shows and cultural exchanges from Mexico, the United States, Spanish Caribbean, and Central America, this has become the more dominant name for the language, especially among younger generations and the middle to upper classes.

Peruvians often prefer the term &quot;castellano&quot; for similar reasons to avoid the linkage between &quot;español&quot; and &quot;España&quot;. The Governorate of New Castile (Gobernación de Nueva Castilla) was established in Lima, Peru in 1528, and Peruvian history classes still emphasize the Castilian origin of the first conquerors and settlers. That tendency often manifests itself in a preference for films dubbed into Latin American Spanish, which often take longer to reach the market, over those in &quot;Español&quot; (Peninsular Spanish characterized by the use of &quot;vosotros&quot;), which tend to be found in pirated &quot;cam&quot; versions of films. Using &quot;español&quot; to refer to Peninsular Spanish is exactly the opposite of how English-speakers use the two terms, which can create some confusion.

&quot;Castellano&quot; may also be used to refer to the dialect of Spanish spoken in Castile, and &quot;español&quot; would generally refer to Standard Spanish. In practice, usage tends to be a matter of local custom rather than reflecting any philosophical or political position. However, the fact that Castile is now a region subsumed within modern Spain has been the decisive factor in the preferential usage of &quot;español&quot; in an international context.

===Countries whose constitutions use the term &quot;castellano&quot;===
*Bolivia: The amendment of 1994 mentions &quot;castellano&quot; in passing; schools use &quot;castellano&quot;, but &quot;español&quot; is still frequent in common speech.
*Colombia: The Colombian Constitution of 1991 uses the term &quot;castellano&quot; to define the official language of the country: &quot;El castellano es el idioma oficial de Colombia&quot;. However, &quot;español&quot; is the most used term in common speech.
*Ecuador
*Paraguay
*Peru: The Peruvian Constitution of 1993 uses the term &quot;castellano&quot; to define the official language of the country. However, &quot;español&quot; is the most used term in common speech.
*Philippines: The first two constitutions of the Philippines specify &quot;castellano&quot;, both in Spanish and Filipino (&quot;Kastilà&quot;), and the official Filipino version of the current 1987 Constitution uses &quot;Kastilà&quot; (&quot;castellano&quot;) when referring to the language. However, the term &quot;español&quot; (&quot;Espanyól&quot;) is also encountered in common speech and writing, and both terms are interchangeable in Philippine Spanish and other languages of the Philippines.
*Spain: Castilian (&quot;castellano&quot;) is the official language of the State. All Spaniards have the duty to know it and the right to use it. Other Spanish languages (languages of Spain) shall be official in the respective autonomous communities, according to their Statutes of Autonomy.
*Venezuela

===Countries whose constitutions use the term &quot;español&quot;===
*Costa Rica 
*Equatorial Guinea
*Guatemala 
*Honduras 
*Nicaragua 
*Panama 

===Countries whose constitutions do not mention any of the terms===
*Argentina 
*Chile
*Cuba 
*Dominican Republic 
*Mexico 
*Uruguay 

==Usage and misconceptions abroad==
Some philologists use &quot;Castilian&quot; only for the language spoken in Castile during the Middle Ages and state that it is preferable to use &quot;Spanish&quot; for its modern form. The dialect of Spanish spoken in northern parts of modern Castile may also be called &quot;Castilian.&quot; It differs from those of other regions of Spain (Andalusia for example); the Castilian dialect is conventionally considered in Spain to be the same as Standard Spanish.

Another use of &quot;Castilian&quot; in English is to distinguish between the Standard Spanish of the Iberian Peninsula and regional dialects. As noted above, the distinction is made to some extent in Spanish but not as far as some English-speakers go; for example, websites with language selection screens give the choice between &quot;Castilian Spanish&quot; and &quot;Latin American Spanish&quot;, among other languages.

In the Americas, where Spanish is the native language of 20 countries, usage of &quot;castellano&quot; and &quot;español&quot; is sometimes reversed to refer to another nation. For example, a Peruvian talking about a Uruguayan might say, &quot;Yo hablo en español peruano, él habla en español uruguayo, pero los dos hablamos castellano&quot; (&quot;I speak Peruvian Spanish, he speaks Uruguayan Spanish, but we both speak Castilian&quot;). That usage comes from the historical association of &quot;español&quot; with the language that was brought to the Americas by conquistadores and was later transformed in each nation through daily usage, with &quot;castellano&quot; as the basis for all variants.

<doc id="125293" wikidata="Q753" url="?curid=125293" title="Copper">
<text>Copper is a chemical element. It has the symbol Cu (), and the atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement.

Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form. This means that copper is a native metal. This led to very early human use in several regions, from . Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores, ; the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, ; and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, .

Commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and have been used widely and historically as pigments.

Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green patina of compounds called verdigris. Copper is sometimes used in decorative art, both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.

Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.

==Etymology==
In the Roman era, copper was mined principally on Cyprus, the origin of the name of the metal, from &quot;aes cyprium&quot; (metal of Cyprus), which later evolved into &quot;cuprum&quot; in popular Latin. &quot;&quot; (Old English) and &quot;copper&quot; were derived from this, the later spelling first used around 1530.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===


Copper, silver, and gold are in group 11 of the periodic table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron on top of a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.

The softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity () and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum possible current density of copper in open air is approximately , above which it begins to heat excessively.

Copper is one of a few metallic elements with a natural color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. This is due to the low plasma frequency of the metal, which lies in the red part of the visible spectrum, causing it to absorb the higher-frequency green and blue colors.

As with other metals, if copper is put in contact with another metal in the presence of an electrolyte, galvanic corrosion will occur.

===Chemical===
Copper does not react with water, but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.

===Isotopes===

There are 29 isotopes of copper. and are stable, with comprising approximately 69% of naturally occurring copper; both have a spin of . The other isotopes are radioactive, with the most stable being with a half-life of 61.83 hours. Seven metastable isomers have been characterized; is the longest-lived with a half-life of 3.8 minutes. Isotopes with a mass number above 64 decay by β−, whereas those with a mass number below 64 decay by β+. , which has a half-life of 12.7 hours, decays both ways.

 and have significant applications. is used in Cu-PTSM as a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography.

===Occurrence===
Copper is produced in massive stars and is present in the Earth&#x27;s crust in a proportion of about 50 parts per million (ppm). In nature, copper occurs in a variety of minerals, including native copper, copper sulfides such as chalcopyrite, bornite, digenite, covellite, and chalcocite, copper sulfosalts such as tetrahedite-tennantite, and enargite, copper carbonates such as azurite and malachite, and as copper(I) or copper(II) oxides such as cuprite and tenorite, respectively. The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US. Native copper is a polycrystal, with the largest single crystal ever described measuring . Copper is the 26th most abundant element in Earth&#x27;s crust, representing 50 ppm compared with 75 ppm for zinc, and 14 ppm for lead.

Typical background concentrations of copper do not exceed in the atmosphere; in soil; in vegetation; 2 μg/L in freshwater and in seawater.

==Production==

Most copper is mined or extracted as copper sulfides from large open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0% copper. Sites include Chuquicamata, in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine, in Utah, United States, and El Chino Mine, in New Mexico, United States. According to the British Geological Survey, in 2005, Chile was the top producer of copper with at least one-third of the world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage. An alternative source of copper for collection currently being researched are polymetallic nodules, which are located at the depths of the Pacific Ocean approximately 3000–6500 meters below sea level. These nodules contain other valuable metals such as cobalt and nickel.

===Reserves and prices===
Copper has been in use for at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth&#x27;s crust, which is about 5 million years&#x27; worth at the current rate of extraction. However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world.
The price of copper is volatile. After a peak in 2022 the price unexpectedly fell.

The global market for copper is one of the most commodified and financialized of the commodity markets, and has been so for decades.

===Extraction===
The great majority of copper ores are sulfides. Common ores are the sulfides chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), bornite (Cu5FeS4) and, to a lesser extent, covellite (CuS) and chalcocite (Cu2S). These ores occur at the level of &lt;1% Cu. Concentration of the ore is required, which begins with comminution followed by froth flotation. The remaining concentrate is smelted, which can be described with two simplified equations:

Cuprous sulfide is oxidized to cuprous oxide:
:2 Cu2S + 3 O2 → 2 Cu2O + 2 SO2

Cuprous oxide reacts with cuprous sulfide to convert to &quot;blister copper&quot; upon heating:
:2 Cu2O + Cu2S → 6 Cu + 2 SO2

This roasting gives matte copper, roughly 50% Cu by weight, which is purified by electrolysis. Depending on the ore, sometimes other metals are obtained during the electrolysis including platinum and gold.

Aside from sulfides, another family of ores are oxides. Approximately 15% of the world&#x27;s copper supply derives from these oxides. The beneficiation process for oxides involves extraction with sulfuric acid solutions followed by electrolysis. In parallel with the above method for &quot;concentrated&quot; sulfide and oxide ores, copper is recovered from mine tailings and heaps. A variety of methods are used including leaching with sulfuric acid, ammonia, ferric chloride. Biological methods are also used.

A potential source of copper is polymetallic nodules, which have an estimated concentration 1.3%.

===Recycling===
According to the International Resource Panel&#x27;s Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of copper in use in society is 35–55 kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (140–300 kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (30–40 kg per capita). In 2001, a typical automobile contained 20–30 kg of copper.

Like aluminium, copper is recyclable without any loss of quality, both from raw state and from manufactured products. An estimated 80% of all copper ever mined is still in use today. In volume, copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium. , recycled copper supplies about one-third of global demand. 

The process of recycling copper is roughly the same as is used to extract copper but requires fewer steps. High-purity scrap copper is melted in a furnace and then reduced and cast into billets and ingots. Lower-purity scrap is melted to form &quot;black copper&quot; (70–90% pure, containing impurities such as iron, zinc, tin, and nickel), followed by oxidation of impurities in a converter to form blister copper (96–98% pure), which is then refined as before.

===Environmental impacts===
The environmental cost of copper mining was estimated at 3.7 kg -eq per kg of copper in 2019. Codelco, a major producer in Chile, reported that in 2020 the company emitted 2.8 t -eq per ton (2.8 kg -eq per kg) of fine copper. Greenhouse gas emissions primarily arise from electricity consumed by the company, especially when sourced from fossil fuels, and from engines required for copper extraction and refinement. Companies that mine land often mismanage waste, rendering the area sterile for life. Additionally, nearby rivers and forests are also negatively impacted. The Philippines is an example of a region where land is overexploited by mining companies.

Copper mining waste in Valea Şesei, Romania, has significantly altered nearby water properties. The water in the affected areas is highly acidic, with a pH range of 2.1–4.9, and shows elevated electrical conductivity levels between 280 and 1561 mS/cm. These changes in water chemistry make the environment inhospitable for fish, essentially rendering the water uninhabitable for aquatic life.

==Alloys==
Numerous copper alloys have been formulated, many with important uses. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but can refer to any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze. Copper is one of the most important constituents of silver and karat gold solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals.

The alloy of copper and nickel, called cupronickel, is used in low-denomination coins, often for the outer cladding. The US five-cent coin (currently called a &quot;nickel&quot;) consists of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. Prior to the introduction of cupronickel, which was widely adopted by countries in the latter half of the 20th century, alloys of copper and silver were also used, with the United States using an alloy of 90% silver and 10% copper until 1965, when circulating silver was removed from all coins with the exception of the half dollar—these were debased to an alloy of 40% silver and 60% copper between 1965 and 1970. The alloy of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various objects exposed to seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries. Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and are used in decorations. &quot;Shakudō&quot; is a Japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold, typically 4–10%, that can be patinated to a dark blue or black color.
==Compounds==

Copper forms a rich variety of compounds, usually with oxidation states +1 and +2, which are often called &quot;cuprous&quot; and &quot;cupric&quot;, respectively. Copper compounds promote or catalyse numerous chemical and biological processes.

===Binary compounds===
As with other elements, the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides, sulfides, and halides. Both cuprous and cupric oxides are known. Among the numerous copper sulfides, important examples include copper(I) sulfide () and copper monosulfide ().

Cuprous halides with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine are known, as are cupric halides with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Attempts to prepare copper(II) iodide yield only copper(I) iodide and iodine.
:2 Cu2+ + 4 I− → 2 CuI + I2

===Coordination chemistry===

Copper forms coordination complexes with ligands. In aqueous solution, copper(II) exists as . This complex exhibits the fastest water exchange rate (speed of water ligands attaching and detaching) for any transition metal aquo complex. Adding aqueous sodium hydroxide causes the precipitation of light blue solid copper(II) hydroxide. A simplified equation is: 
:Cu2+ + 2 OH− → Cu(OH)2
Aqueous ammonia results in the same precipitate. Upon adding excess ammonia, the precipitate dissolves, forming tetraamminecopper(II):
: + 4 NH3 → + 2 H2O + 2 OH−
Many other oxyanions form complexes; these include copper(II) acetate, copper(II) nitrate, and copper(II) carbonate. Copper(II) sulfate forms a blue crystalline pentahydrate, the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory. It is used in a fungicide called the Bordeaux mixture.
Polyols, compounds containing more than one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict&#x27;s reagent and Fehling&#x27;s solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer&#x27;s reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids such as cystine form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II) including in the form of metal-organic biohybrids (MOBs). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferricyanide, which gives a red-brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.

===Organocopper chemistry===

Compounds that contain a carbon-copper bond are known as organocopper compounds. They are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper(I) oxide and have many uses in chemistry. They are synthesized by treating copper(I) compounds with Grignard reagents, terminal alkynes or organolithium reagents; in particular, the last reaction described produces a Gilman reagent. These can undergo substitution with alkyl halides to form coupling products; as such, they are important in the field of organic synthesis. Copper(I) acetylide is highly shock-sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the Cadiot–Chodkiewicz coupling and the Sonogashira coupling. Conjugate addition to enones and carbocupration of alkynes can also be achieved with organocopper compounds. Copper(I) forms a variety of weak complexes with alkenes and carbon monoxide, especially in the presence of amine ligands.

===Copper(III) and copper(IV)===
Copper(III) is most often found in oxides. A simple example is potassium cuprate, KCuO2, a blue-black solid. The most extensively studied copper(III) compounds are the cuprate superconductors. Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7) consists of both Cu(II) and Cu(III) centres. Like oxide, fluoride is a highly basic anion and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states. Both copper(III) and even copper(IV) fluorides are known, K3CuF6 and Cs2CuF6, respectively.

Some copper proteins form oxo complexes, which, in extensively studied synthetic analog systems, feature copper(III). With tetrapeptides, purple-colored copper(III) complexes are stabilized by the deprotonated amide ligands.

Complexes of copper(III) are also found as intermediates in reactions of organocopper compounds, for example in the Kharasch–Sosnovsky reaction.

==History==
A timeline of copper illustrates how this metal has advanced human civilization for the past 11,000 years.

===Prehistoric===
====Copper Age====


Copper occurs naturally as native metallic copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. The history of copper use dates to 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. Evidence suggests that gold and meteoric iron (but not smelted iron) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to follow this sequence: first, cold working of native copper, then annealing, smelting, and, finally, lost-wax casting. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these techniques appear more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic .

Copper smelting was independently invented in different places. The earliest evidence of lost-wax casting copper comes from an amulet found in Mehrgarh, Pakistan, and is dated to 4000 BC. Investment casting was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia Smelting was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC.

While scholars have long believed that major changes in supra-regional networks occurred with the onset of the Bronze Age (due to the need for bronze), it is now clear that even the early copper in Europe was associated with intensified networks. The copper that reached the Alps, central and northern Europe in the fourth millennium BC was mined in Bulgaria and Serbia.

Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300 to 3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting likely led to the discovery of iron smelting. 

Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6500 and 3000 BC. A copper spearpoint found in Wisconsin has been dated to 6500 BC. Copper usage by the indigenous peoples of the Old Copper Complex from the Great Lakes region of North America has been radiometrically dated to as far back as 7500 BC. Indigenous peoples of North America around the Great Lakes may have also been mining copper during this time, making it one of the oldest known examples of copper extraction in the world. There is evidence from prehistoric lead pollution from lakes in Michigan that people in the region began mining copper . Evidence suggests that utilitarian copper objects fell increasingly out of use in the Old Copper Complex of North America during the Bronze Age and a shift towards an increased production of ornamental copper objects occurred.

====Bronze Age====
Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC. Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting, and about 2000 years after &quot;natural bronze&quot; had come into general use. Bronze artifacts from the Vinča culture date to 4500 BC. Sumerian and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC. Egyptian Blue, or cuprorivaite (calcium copper silicate) is a synthetic pigment that contains copper and started being used in ancient Egypt around 3250 BC. The manufacturing process of Egyptian blue was known to the Romans, but by the fourth century AD the pigment fell out of use and the secret to its manufacturing process became lost. The Romans said the blue pigment was made from copper, silica, lime and natron and was known to them as &quot;caeruleum.&quot;

The Bronze Age began in Southeastern Europe around 3700–3300 BC, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000–1000 BC in the Near East, and 600 BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the Chalcolithic period (copper-stone), when copper tools were used with stone tools. The term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world, the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin. It was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.

===Ancient and post-classical===

In Greece, copper was known by the name (χαλκός). It was an important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In Roman times, it was known as &quot;aes Cyprium&quot;, being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and &quot;Cyprium&quot; from Cyprus, where much copper was mined. The phrase was simplified to &quot;cuprum&quot;, hence the English &quot;copper&quot;. Aphrodite (Venus in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors; Cyprus, the source of copper, was sacred to the goddess. The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper, both because of the connection to the goddess and because Venus was the brightest heavenly body after the Sun and Moon and so corresponded to the most lustrous and desirable metal after gold and silver.

Copper was first mined in ancient Britain as early as 2100 BC. Mining at the largest of these mines, the Great Orme, continued into the late Bronze Age. Mining seems to have been largely restricted to supergene ores, which were easier to smelt. The rich copper deposits of Cornwall seem to have been largely untouched, in spite of extensive tin mining in the region, for reasons likely social and political rather than technological.

In North America, native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600 AD. Copper annealing was being performed in the North American city of Cahokia around 1000–1300 AD. There are several exquisite copper plates, known as the Mississippian copper plates that have been found in North America in the area around Cahokia dating from this time period (1000–1300 AD). The copper plates were thought to have been manufactured at Cahokia before ending up elsewhere in the Midwest and southeastern United States like the Wulfing cache and Etowah plates.

In South America a copper mask dated to 1000 BC found in the Argentinian Andes is the oldest known copper artifact discovered in the Andes. Peru has been considered the origin for early copper metallurgy in pre-Columbian America, but the copper mask from Argentina suggests that the Cajón del Maipo of the southern Andes was another important center for early copper workings in South America. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal&#x27;s commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.

The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar&#x27;s coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000 t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.

The gates of the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze treated with depletion gilding. The process was most prevalent in Alexandria, where alchemy is thought to have begun. In ancient India, copper was used in the holistic medical science Ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment. Ancient Egyptians (~2400 BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water, and later to treat headaches, burns, and itching.

===Modern===
The Great Copper Mountain was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that operated from the 10th century to 1992. It satisfied two-thirds of Europe&#x27;s copper consumption in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden&#x27;s wars during that time. It was referred to as the nation&#x27;s treasury; Sweden had a copper backed currency.
Copper is used in roofing, currency, and for photographic technology known as the daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; copper continues to be used in construction of various types. Copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal&#x27;s atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones.

During the rise in demand for copper for the Age of Electricity, from the 1880s until the Great Depression of the 1930s, the United States produced one third to half the world&#x27;s newly mined copper. Major districts included the Keweenaw district of northern Michigan, primarily native copper deposits, which was eclipsed by the vast sulphide deposits of Butte, Montana, in the late 1880s, which itself was eclipsed by porphyry deposits of the Southwest United States, especially at Bingham Canyon, Utah, and Morenci, Arizona. Introduction of open pit steam shovel mining and innovations in smelting, refining, flotation concentration and other processing steps led to mass production. Early in the twentieth century, Arizona ranked first, followed by Montana, then Utah and Michigan.

Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world&#x27;s primary copper production.

The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, formed in 1967 by Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia, operated in the copper market as OPEC does in oil, though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was never a member; it was dissolved in 1988.

In 2008, China became the world&#x27;s largest importer of copper and has continued to be as of at least 2023.

==Applications==
The major applications of copper are electrical wire (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is required, it is put into such alloys as brass and bronze (5% of total use). For more than two centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish. A small part of the copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Machining of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating intricate parts.

===Wire and cable===
Despite competition from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring is the most important market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.

For a short period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, copper wiring was replaced by aluminium wiring in many housing construction projects in America. The new wiring was implicated in a number of house fires and the industry returned to copper.

===Electronics and related devices===

Integrated circuits and printed circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. Electromagnets, vacuum tubes, cathode-ray tubes, and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do waveguides for microwave radiation.

===Electric motors===

Copper&#x27;s superior conductivity enhances the efficiency of electrical motors. This is important because motors and motor-driven systems account for 43–46% of all global electricity consumption and 69% of all electricity used by industry. Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases the efficiency of the motor. Copper motor rotors, a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives, are enabling general-purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) premium efficiency standards.

=== Renewable energy production ===
===Architecture===


Copper has been used since ancient times as a durable, corrosion resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years. Copper&#x27;s architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper&#x27;s other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.

The metal&#x27;s distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers. The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion, thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering. It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain. Architectural copper and its alloys can also be &#x27;finished&#x27; to take on a particular look, feel, or color. Finishes include mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.

Copper has excellent brazing and soldering properties and can be welded; the best results are obtained with gas metal arc welding.

===Antibiofouling===

Copper is biostatic, meaning bacteria and many other forms of life will not grow on it. For this reason it has long been used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.

===Antimicrobial===
Copper-alloy touch surfaces have natural properties that destroy a wide range of microorganisms (e.g., &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7, methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA), &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, &quot;Clostridium difficile&quot;, influenza A virus, adenovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and fungi). Indians have been using copper vessels since ancient times for storing water, even before modern science realized its antimicrobial properties. Some copper alloys were proven to kill more than 99.9% of disease-causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as &quot;antimicrobial materials with public health benefits&quot;; that approval allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health benefits of products made of registered alloys. In addition, the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys, such as bedrails, handrails, over-bed tables, sinks, faucets, door knobs, toilet hardware, computer keyboards, health club equipment, and shopping cart handles. Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease, and Legionnaires&#x27; disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems. Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U.K., Ireland, Japan, Korea, France, Denmark, and Brazil, as well as being called for in the US, and in the subway transit system in Santiago, Chile, where copper–zinc alloy handrails were installed in some 30 stations between 2011 and 2014.
Textile fibers can be blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics.

===Copper demand===
Total world production in 2023 is expected to be almost 23 million metric tons. Copper demand is increasing due to the ongoing energy transition to electricity. China accounts for over half the demand.

For some purposes, other metals can substitute, aluminium wire was substituted in many applications, but improper design resulted in fire hazards. The safety issues have since been solved by use of larger sizes of aluminium wire (#8AWG and up), and properly designed aluminium wiring is still being installed in place of copper. For example, the Airbus A380 uses aluminum wire in place of copper wire for electrical power transmission.

==== Speculative investing ====
Copper may be used as a speculative investment due to the predicted increase in use from worldwide infrastructure growth, and the important role it has in producing wind turbines, solar panels, and other renewable energy sources. Another reason predicted demand increases is the fact that electric cars contain an average of 3.6 times as much copper as conventional cars, although the effect of electric cars on copper demand is debated. Some people invest in copper through copper mining stocks, ETFs, and futures. Others store physical copper in the form of copper bars or rounds although these tend to carry a higher premium in comparison to precious metals. Those who want to avoid the premiums of copper bullion alternatively store old copper wire, copper tubing or American pennies made before 1982.

===Folk medicine===
Copper is commonly used in jewelry, and according to some folklore, copper bracelets relieve arthritis symptoms. In one trial for osteoarthritis and one trial for rheumatoid arthritis, no differences were found between copper bracelet and control (non-copper) bracelet. No evidence shows that copper can be absorbed through the skin. If it were, it might lead to copper poisoning.

==Degradation==
&quot;Chromobacterium violaceum&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; can both mobilize solid copper as a cyanide compound. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with &quot;Calluna&quot;, &quot;Erica&quot; and &quot;Vaccinium&quot; can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper. The ectomycorrhizal fungus &quot;Suillus luteus&quot; protects young pine trees from copper toxicity. A sample of the fungus &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus also plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.

==Biological role==

=== Biochemistry ===
Copper proteins have diverse roles in biological electron transport and oxygen transportation, processes that exploit the easy interconversion of Cu(I) and Cu(II). Copper is essential in the aerobic respiration of all eukaryotes. In mitochondria, it is found in cytochrome c oxidase, which is the last protein in oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O2 between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 4 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water. Copper is also found in many superoxide dismutases, proteins that catalyze the decomposition of superoxides by converting it (by disproportionation) to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide:
* Cu2+-SOD + O2− → Cu+-SOD + O2 (reduction of copper; oxidation of superoxide)
* Cu+-SOD + O2− + 2H+ → Cu2+-SOD + H2O2 (oxidation of copper; reduction of superoxide)

The protein hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods such as the horseshoe crab (&quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot;). Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by their role in the formation of lacquers. The biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Several copper proteins, such as the &quot;blue copper proteins&quot;, do not interact directly with substrates; hence they are not enzymes. These proteins relay electrons by the process called electron transfer.
A unique tetranuclear copper center has been found in nitrous-oxide reductase.

Chemical compounds which were developed for treatment of Wilson&#x27;s disease have been investigated for use in cancer therapy.

=== Nutrition ===
Copper is an essential trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper at a level of about 1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass.

====Absorption====
Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.

====Dietary recommendations====
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated the estimated average requirements (EARs) and recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for copper in 2001. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The AIs for copper are: 200 μg of copper for 0–6-month-old males and females, and 220 μg of copper for 7–12-month-old males and females. For both sexes, the RDAs for copper are: 340 μg of copper for 1–3 years old, 440 μg of copper for 4–8 years old, 700 μg of copper for 9–13 years old, 890 μg of copper for 14–18 years old and 900 μg of copper for ages 19 years and older. For pregnancy, 1,000 μg. For lactation, 1,300 μg. As for safety, the IOM also sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of copper, the UL is set at 10 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For women and men ages 18 and older, the AIs are set at 1.3 and 1.6 mg/day, respectively. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is 1.5 mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years, the AIs increase with age from 0.7 to 1.3 mg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 5 mg/day, which is half the U.S. value.

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For copper labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 2.0 mg, but , it was revised to 0.9 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

===Deficiency===
Because of its role in facilitating iron uptake, copper deficiency can produce anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Conversely, Wilson&#x27;s disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.

Severe deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels, low ceruloplasmin, and low red blood cell superoxide dismutase levels; these are not sensitive to marginal copper status. The &quot;cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets&quot; has been stated as another factor in deficiency, but the results have not been confirmed by replication.

===Toxicity===
Gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA. Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30 mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3 ppm in the diet. However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency, growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.

Chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to Wilson&#x27;s disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis of the liver in persons who have inherited two defective genes.

Elevated copper levels have also been linked to worsening symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

=== Human exposure ===
In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for copper dust and fumes in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1 mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1 mg/m3, time-weighted average. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 100 mg/m3.

Copper is a constituent of tobacco smoke. The tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals, such as copper from the surrounding soil into its leaves. These are readily absorbed into the user&#x27;s body following smoke inhalation. The health implications are not clear.

<text>The European Youth Parliament (EYP) is a politically unbound non-profit organisation, which encourages European youth to actively engage in citizenship and cultural understanding. It annually involves around 25,000 youth from across Europe in its events and has around 6,000 active members in the different countries. It was established in 1987 in Fontainebleau, France.

The EYP operates in 40 European countries, both inside and outside the European Union. A member of the organisation may be known as a Member of the European Youth Parliament (MEYP).

== History ==
The European Youth Parliament was founded by Laurent Grégoire (FR) and Bettina Carr-Allinson (NL), initially, as a school project at the Lycée François-Ier in Fontainebleau, to the south of Paris. It is there that three of the first four International Sessions were held, starting in 1988, about a year after the idea took place.

It then developed steadily for a few years until it moved to Witney, Oxfordshire, in 1991, and was legally recognised as the &quot;European Youth Parliament International Ltd.&quot;, a subsidiary of a charity created in 1992 for this purpose, the Fontainebleau Youth Foundation. The organisation experienced enduring growth for the next ten years, its network counting an increasing number of National Committees and its activities becoming both larger and more numerous. The National Committees stretch beyond the scope of countries within the European Union and try to encompass all European countries.

In the years 2001 to 2004, the EYP encountered various problems of financial nature. On 4 November 2004, however, the European Youth Parliament was reborn due to a mutual agreement between representatives of EYP&#x27;s Board of National Committees, alumni and the Heinz-Schwarzkopf Foundation. The EYP&#x27;s status since then has been a programme of the Schwarzkopf-Stiftung Junges Europa, and is hosted in Berlin, Germany.

The actual activities of the EYP never faltered during this period.

Since 2004, the EYP has introduced several reforms to introduce more transparency in its institutions and further enlarged its activities.

== Management ==
At the international level, the EYP is governed by an international board, the Governing Body. The Governing Body has six members elected by the National Committees and by the alumni of past sessions. A representative of the Schwarzkopf Foundation, as well as the EYP&#x27;s executive director, are also members. The board is largely responsible for the quality assurance of the International Sessions but also takes responsibility for the overall direction of the organisation and the long-term sustainability and protection of the organisation. The day-to-day business of the organisation is administered by a hired manager at the International Office in Berlin. Philipp J. Scharff was the manager from 2004 until 2008, Jan Phillip Beck (DE) from 2008 until 2011, Ville Vasaramäki (FI) from 2011 until 2013, Krista Lagus (FI) from 2013 until 2017 and Lukas Fendel (DE) from 2017 to 2020. Anya Suprunenko was appointed as Executive Director in 2020. In 2022, Pauline Chetail (FR) was made acting Executive Director as Anya went on temporary leave. 

At the national level, the National Committees are free to choose how to manage themselves, provided they comply with basic democratic principles. The National Committees are responsible for organising and funding their own national sessions. International Sessions can receive limited funding from EYP at the international level but are also largely responsible for their economy. Sessions are usually funded through sponsorship from various organisations or corporations.

== Sessions ==
EYP organises three international sessions each year. They are organised in different countries and all European countries are invited to join, not just members of the EU. Each country&#x27;s national committee selects a delegation to participate in each session, the size of which depends on various factors. The delegates are distributed to different committees, each tasked with addressing a particular topic. 

Other sessions are organized under the supervision of national boards, including Regional Selection Sessions, National Selection Sessions, International Forums, Small Scale Events and Training Days. National Selection Conferences (sessions) are usually where the selection of the delegations sent to International Sessions takes place. The selection process in most countries (notably excluding France) is taken up by a team of Jurors, led by the Head Of Jury (HoJ), which objectively selects a number of delegates to &quot;pass&quot; on to the next stage.

Each international session starts with a two-day Teambuilding part, in which delegates get acquainted with each other and start improving the group dynamics of the committee. The delegates play different games which are meant to bring the delegates from an initial shyness stage to a comfortable, open atmosphere optimal for efficient Committee work.

This is followed by four or five days for Committee Work. During this time the delegates discuss a problematic topic on current European political matters and write a resolution on how to deal with the issue. A member of the European Parliament or some alternative expert will generally visit once to answer questions and quickly discuss the topic with the Committee.

The sessions end with a General Assembly, in which the committee resolutions are looked through, altered and approved (or if the resolution is found unacceptable, not approved). If a resolution is approved it is sent on to the European Parliament, for the consideration of MEPs. General Assembly is usually held in some honorary or prestigious location, such as the host country&#x27;s Houses of Parliament or the main hall of the City Council.

Additionally, National Committees of EYP organise several national and regional sessions every year. National sessions are to select a delegation for one of the upcoming international sessions. These sessions are shorter, normally lasting three days and do not invite a member of the European Parliament to the committees. Regional sessions are of varying length, from 3 to 7 or 8 days, and in essence, imitate international sessions. They have, however, a more constrained budget and tend to be less formal than international sessions. For both national and regional sessions, resolutions are not sent to the European Parliament.

<text>A delusion is a fixed belief that is not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence. As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, confabulation, dogma, illusion, hallucination, or some other misleading effects of perception, as individuals with those beliefs &quot;are&quot; able to change or readjust their beliefs upon reviewing the evidence. However:

&quot;The distinction between a delusion and a strongly held idea is sometimes difficult to make and depends in part on the degree of conviction with which the belief is held despite clear or reasonable contradictory evidence regarding its veracity.&quot;

Delusions have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states (both general physical and mental) and are of particular diagnostic importance in psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, paraphrenia, manic episodes of bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression.

==Types==
Delusions are categorized into four different groups:

* &quot;Bizarre delusion&quot;: Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable to same-culture peers and do not derive from ordinary life experiences. An example named by the DSM-5 is a belief that someone replaced all of one&#x27;s internal organs with someone else&#x27;s without leaving a scar, depending on the organ in question.
* &quot;Non-bizarre delusion&quot;: A delusion that, though false, reflects real–life situations and is at least technically possible; it may include feelings of being followed, poisoned, infected etc. e.g., the affected person mistakenly believes that they are under constant police surveillance.
* &quot;Mood-congruent delusion&quot;: Any delusion with content consistent with either a depressive or manic state, e.g., a depressed person believes that news anchors on television highly disapprove of them, or a person in a manic state might believe they are a powerful deity.
* &quot;Mood-neutral delusion&quot;: A delusion that does not relate to the patient&#x27;s emotional state; for example, a belief that an extra limb is growing out of the back of one&#x27;s head is neutral to either depression or mania.

French psychiatry (which is influenced by psychoanalysis), however, also establishes a difference between &quot;paranoid&quot; (&quot;paranoïde&quot;) and &quot;paranoiac&quot; (&quot;paranoïaque&quot;) delusion. The &quot;paranoid delusion&quot;, observed in schizophrenia, is non-systematized and is characterized by a disorganized structure and confused speech and thoughts. The &quot;paranoiac delusion&quot;, observed in paraphrenia, is highly systematized (which means it is very organized and clear) and is focused on a single theme.

===Themes===
In addition to these categories, delusions often manifest according to a consistent theme. Although delusions can have any theme, certain themes are more common. Some of the more common delusion themes are:
* &quot;Delusion of control&quot;: False belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one&#x27;s general thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behaviors.
* &quot;Delusional jealousy&quot;: False belief that a spouse or lover is having an affair, with no proof to back up the claim.
* &quot;Delusion of guilt or sin (or delusion of self-accusation)&quot;: Ungrounded feeling of remorse or guilt of delusional intensity.
* &quot;Thought broadcasting:&quot; False belief that other people can know one&#x27;s thoughts.
* &quot;Delusion of thought insertion&quot;: Belief that another thinks through the mind of the person.
* &quot;Persecutory delusions:&quot; False belief that one is being persecuted. 
* &quot;Delusion of reference&quot;: False belief that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in one&#x27;s environment have personal meaning or significance. &quot;Usually the meaning assigned to these events is negative, but the &#x27;messages&#x27; can also have a grandiose quality.&quot;
* &quot;Erotomania&quot;: False belief that another person is in love with them.
* &quot;Religious delusion&quot;: Belief that the affected person is a god or chosen to act as a god.
* &quot;Somatic delusion&quot;: Delusion whose content pertains to bodily functioning, bodily sensations or physical appearance. Usually the false belief is that the body is somehow diseased, abnormal or changed. A specific example of this delusion is delusional parasitosis: Delusion in which one feels infested with insects, bacteria, mites, spiders, lice, fleas, worms, or other organisms.
* &quot;Delusion of poverty&quot;: Person strongly believes they are financially incapacitated. Although this type of delusion is less common now, it was particularly widespread in the days preceding state support.

===Grandiose delusions===
Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur are principally a subtype of delusional disorder but could possibly feature as a symptom of schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder. Grandiose delusions are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, omnipotent or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic, often with a supernatural, science-fictional, or religious bent. In colloquial usage, one who overestimates one&#x27;s own abilities, talents, stature or situation is sometimes said to have &quot;delusions of grandeur&quot;. This is generally due to excessive pride, rather than any actual delusions. Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur can also be associated with megalomania.

===Persecutory delusions===

Persecutory delusions are the most common type of delusions and involve the theme of being followed, harassed, cheated, poisoned or drugged, conspired against, spied on, attacked, or otherwise obstructed in the pursuit of goals.
Persecutory delusions are a condition in which the affected person wrongly believes that they are being persecuted. Specifically, they have been defined as containing two central elements: The individual thinks that:
* harm is occurring, or is going to occur
* the persecutors have the intention to cause harm

According to the &quot;DSM-IV-TR&quot;, persecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in schizophrenia, where the person believes they are &quot;being tormented, followed, sabotaged, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed&quot;. In the &quot;DSM-IV-TR&quot;, persecutory delusions are the main feature of the persecutory type of delusional disorder. When the focus is to remedy some injustice by legal action, they are sometimes called &quot;querulous paranoia&quot;.

==Causes==

Explaining the causes of delusions continues to be challenging and several theories have been developed. One is the genetic or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with delusional disorder are at increased risk of delusional traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might experience the onset of delusional disorder in those moments when coping with life and maintaining high self-esteem becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.

This condition is more common among people who have poor hearing or sight. Also, ongoing stressors have been associated with a higher possibility of developing delusions. Examples of such stressors are immigration, low socioeconomic status, and even possibly the accumulation of smaller daily struggles.

===Specific delusions===
The top two factors mainly concerned in the germination of delusions are disorder of brain functioning and background influences of temperament and personality.

Higher levels of dopamine qualify as a sign of disorders of brain function. That they are needed to sustain certain delusions was examined by a preliminary study on delusional disorder (a psychotic syndrome) instigated to clarify if schizophrenia had a dopamine psychosis. There were positive results - delusions of jealousy and persecution had different levels of dopamine metabolite HVA and homovanillyl alcohol (which may have been genetic). These can be only regarded as tentative results; the study called for future research with a larger population.

It is simplistic to say that a certain measure of dopamine will bring about a specific delusion. Studies show age and gender to be influential and it is most likely that HVA levels change during the life course of some syndromes.

On the influence of personality, it has been said: &quot;Jaspers considered there is a subtle change in personality due to the illness itself; and this creates the condition for the development of the delusional atmosphere in which the delusional intuition arises.&quot;

Cultural factors have &quot;a decisive influence in shaping delusions&quot;. For example, delusions of guilt and punishment are frequent in a Western, Christian country like Austria, but not in Pakistan, where it is more likely persecution. Similarly, in a series of case studies, delusions of guilt and punishment were found in Austrian patients with Parkinson&#x27;s being treated with l-dopa, a dopamine agonist.

==Pathophysiology==
The two-factor model of delusions posits that dysfunction in both belief formation systems and belief evaluation systems are necessary for delusions. Dysfunction in evaluations systems localized to the right lateral prefrontal cortex, regardless of delusion content, is supported by neuroimaging studies and is congruent with its role in conflict monitoring in healthy persons. Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as frontotemporal dementia, psychosis and Lewy body dementia. Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with &quot;jumping to conclusions&quot;, damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.

The aberrant salience model suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli. In support of this hypothesis, regions normally associated with the salience network demonstrate reduced grey matter in people with delusions, and the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is widely implicated in salience processing, is also widely implicated in psychotic disorders.

Specific regions have been associated with specific types of delusions. The volume of the hippocampus and parahippocampus is related to paranoid delusions in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and has been reported to be abnormal post mortem in one person with delusions. Capgras delusions have been associated with occipito-temporal damage and may be related to failure to elicit normal emotions or memories in response to faces.

==Diagnosis==

The modern definition and Jaspers&#x27; original criteria have been criticised, as counter-examples can be shown for every defining feature.

Studies on psychiatric patients show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief.

Delusions do not necessarily have to be false or &#x27;incorrect inferences about external reality&#x27;. Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.
In other situations the delusion may turn out to be true belief. For example, in delusional jealousy, where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person. In this case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be verified as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused.

In other cases, the belief may be mistakenly assumed to be false by a doctor or psychiatrist assessing it, just because it &quot;seems&quot; to be unlikely, bizarre or held with excessive conviction. Psychiatrists rarely have the time or resources to check the validity of a person&#x27;s claims leading to some true beliefs to be erroneously classified as delusional. This is known as the Martha Mitchell effect, after the wife of the attorney general who alleged that illegal activity was taking place in the White House. At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the Watergate scandal broke was she proved right (and hence sane).

Similar factors have led to criticisms of Jaspers&#x27; definition of true delusions as being ultimately &#x27;un-understandable&#x27;. Critics (such as R. D. Laing) have argued that this leads to the diagnosis of delusions being based on the subjective understanding of a particular psychiatrist, who may not have access to all the information that might make a belief otherwise interpretable. R. D. Laing&#x27;s hypothesis has been applied to some forms of projective therapy to &quot;fix&quot; a delusional system so that it cannot be altered by the patient. Psychiatric researchers at Yale University, Ohio State University and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used novels and motion picture films as the focus. Texts, plots and cinematography are discussed and the delusions approached tangentially. This use of fiction to decrease the malleability of a delusion was employed in a joint project by science-fiction author Philip Jose Farmer and Yale psychiatrist A. James Giannini. They wrote the novel &quot;Red Orc&#x27;s Rage&quot;, which, recursively, deals with delusional adolescents who are treated with a form of projective therapy. In this novel&#x27;s fictional setting other novels written by Farmer are discussed and the characters are symbolically integrated into the delusions of fictional patients. This particular novel was then applied to real-life clinical settings.

Another difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in &quot;normal&quot; beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features, yet are not universally considered delusional. For instance, if a person was holding a true belief then they will of course persist with it. This can cause the disorder to be misdiagnosed by psychiatrists. These factors have led the psychiatrist Anthony David to note that &quot;there is no acceptable (rather than accepted) definition of a delusion.&quot; In practice, psychiatrists tend to diagnose a belief as delusional if it is either patently bizarre, causing significant distress, or excessively pre-occupying the patient, especially if the person is subsequently unswayed in belief by counter-evidence or reasonable arguments.

Joseph Pierre, M.D. states that one factor that helps differentiate delusions from other kinds of beliefs is that anomalous subjective experiences are often used to justify delusional beliefs. While idiosyncratic and self-referential content often make delusions impossible to share with others, Pierre suggests that it may be more helpful to emphasize the level of conviction, preoccupation, and extension of a belief rather than the content of the belief when considering whether a belief is delusional.

It is important to distinguish true delusions from other symptoms such as anxiety, fear, or paranoia. To diagnose delusions a mental state examination may be used. This test includes appearance, mood, affect, behavior, rate and continuity of speech, evidence of hallucinations or abnormal beliefs, thought content, orientation to time, place and person, attention and concentration, insight and judgment, as well as short-term memory.

Johnson-Laird suggests that delusions may be viewed as the natural consequence of failure to distinguish conceptual relevance. That is, irrelevant information would be framed as disconnected experiences, then it is taken to be relevant in a manner that suggests false causal connections. Furthermore, relevant information would be ignored as counterexamples.

===Definition===
Although non-specific concepts of madness have been around for several thousand years, the psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers was the first to define the four main criteria for a belief to be considered delusional in his 1913 book &quot;General Psychopathology&quot;. These criteria are:
# certainty (held with absolute conviction)
# incorrigibility (not changeable by compelling counterargument or proof to the contrary)
# impossibility or falsity of content (implausible, bizarre, or patently untrue)
# not amenable to understanding (i.e., belief cannot be explained psychologically)

Furthermore, when beliefs involve value judgments, only those which cannot be proven true are considered delusions. For example: a man claiming that he flew into the Sun and flew back home. This would be considered a delusion, unless he were speaking figuratively, or if the belief had a cultural or religious source. Only the first three criteria remain cornerstones of the current definition of a delusion in the DSM-5.

Robert Trivers writes that delusion is a discrepancy in relation to objective reality, but with a firm conviction in reality of delusional ideas, which is manifested in the &quot;affective basis of delusion&quot;.

==Treatment==
Delusions and other positive symptoms of psychosis are often treated with antipsychotic medication, which exert a medium effect size according to meta-analytic evidence. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) improves delusions relative to control conditions according to a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of 43 studies reported that metacognitive training (MCT) reduces delusions at a medium to large effect size relative to control conditions.

==Criticism==
Some psychiatrists criticize the practice of defining one and the same belief as normal in one culture and pathological in another culture for cultural essentialism. They argue that it is not justified to assume that culture can be simplified to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything outside those factors must be biological since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, and media, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person&#x27;s belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing empirical evidence, only that psychiatrists rarely, if ever, present patients with such situations.

Anthropologist David Graeber has criticized psychiatry&#x27;s assumption that an absurd belief goes from being delusional to &quot;being there for a reason&quot; merely because it is shared by many people by arguing that just as genetic pathogens like viruses can take advantage of an organism without benefitting said organism, memetic phenomena can spread while being harmful to societies, implying that entire societies can become ill. David Graeber argued that if somatic medicine did not have higher scientific standards than psychiatry&#x27;s way of defining delusion, pandemics like the plague would have been considered to transubstantiate from an illness to &quot;a phenomenon that benefits the people&quot; as soon as it had spread to a sufficiently large portion of the population. It was argued by Graeber that since deinstitutionalisation made sales of psychiatric medication profitable by no longer needing to spend money on keeping the patients in mental hospitals, corrupt incentives for psychiatry to allege &quot;needs&quot; for treatments 
have increased (in particular with regard to medicines that are said to be needed in daily doses, not so much regarding devices that can be kept for longer periods of time) which may itself be a harmful memetic pandemic in society that leads to diagnosing and medication of criticisms of widespread beliefs that are actually absurd and harmful, making the absurd belief that is not labelled as an illness profitable anyway by attracting criticisms that are labelled as illnesses.

<text>Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and an algorithmic paradigm. The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics.

In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have &quot;optimal substructure&quot;.

If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems. In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation.

== Overview ==

=== Mathematical optimization ===
In terms of mathematical optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time.

This is done by defining a sequence of value functions &quot;V&quot;1, &quot;V&quot;2, ..., &quot;V&quot;&quot;n&quot; taking &quot;y&quot; as an argument representing the state of the system at times &quot;i&quot; from 1 to &quot;n&quot;.

The definition of &quot;V&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) is the value obtained in state &quot;y&quot; at the last time &quot;n&quot;.

The values &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; at earlier times &quot;i&quot; = &quot;n&quot; −1, &quot;n&quot; − 2, ..., 2, 1 can be found by working backwards, using a recursive relationship called the Bellman equation.

For &quot;i&quot; = 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;, &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1 at any state &quot;y&quot; is calculated from &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time &quot;i&quot; − 1 and the function &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; at the new state of the system if this decision is made.

Since &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1 for those states.

Finally, &quot;V&quot;1 at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.

=== Control theory ===
In control theory, a typical problem is to find an admissible control formula_1 which causes the system formula_2 to follow an admissible trajectory formula_3 on a continuous time interval formula_4 that minimizes a cost function
:formula_5 
The solution to this problem is an optimal control law or policy formula_6, which produces an optimal trajectory formula_3 and a cost-to-go function formula_8. The latter obeys the fundamental equation of dynamic programming:
:formula_9
a partial differential equation known as the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, in which formula_10 and formula_11. One finds that minimizing formula_12 in terms of formula_13, formula_14, and the unknown function formula_15 and then substitutes the result into the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation to get the partial differential equation to be solved with boundary condition formula_16. In practice, this generally requires numerical techniques for some discrete approximation to the exact optimization relationship.

Alternatively, the continuous process can be approximated by a discrete system, which leads to a following recurrence relation analog to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation:
:formula_17
at the formula_18-th stage of formula_19 equally spaced discrete time intervals, and where formula_20 and formula_21 denote discrete approximations to formula_22 and formula_23. This functional equation is known as the Bellman equation, which can be solved for an exact solution of the discrete approximation of the optimization equation.

==== Example from economics: Ramsey&#x27;s problem of optimal saving ====

In economics, the objective is generally to maximize (rather than minimize) some dynamic social welfare function. In Ramsey&#x27;s problem, this function relates amounts of consumption to levels of utility. Loosely speaking, the planner faces the trade-off between contemporaneous consumption and future consumption (via investment in capital stock that is used in production), known as intertemporal choice. Future consumption is discounted at a constant rate formula_24. A discrete approximation to the transition equation of capital is given by
:formula_25
where formula_26 is consumption, formula_18 is capital, and formula_22 is a production function satisfying the Inada conditions. An initial capital stock formula_29 is assumed.

Let formula_30 be consumption in period , and assume consumption yields utility formula_31 as long as the consumer lives. Assume the consumer is impatient, so that he discounts future utility by a factor each period, where formula_32 be capital in period . Assume initial capital is a given amount formula_33, and suppose that this period&#x27;s capital and consumption determine next period&#x27;s capital as formula_34, where is a positive constant and formula_35. Assume capital cannot be negative. Then the consumer&#x27;s decision problem can be written as follows:

: formula_36 subject to formula_37 for all formula_38

Written this way, the problem looks complicated, because it involves solving for all the choice variables formula_39. (The capital formula_40 is not a choice variable—the consumer&#x27;s initial capital is taken as given.)

The dynamic programming approach to solve this problem involves breaking it apart into a sequence of smaller decisions. To do so, we define a sequence of &quot;value functions&quot; formula_41, for formula_42 which represent the value of having any amount of capital at each time . There is (by assumption) no utility from having capital after death, formula_43.

The value of any quantity of capital at any previous time can be calculated by backward induction using the Bellman equation. In this problem, for each formula_38, the Bellman equation is

: formula_45 subject to formula_37

This problem is much simpler than the one we wrote down before, because it involves only two decision variables, formula_30 and formula_48. Intuitively, instead of choosing his whole lifetime plan at birth, the consumer can take things one step at a time. At time , his current capital formula_49 is given, and he only needs to choose current consumption formula_30 and saving formula_48.

To actually solve this problem, we work backwards. For simplicity, the current level of capital is denoted as . formula_52 is already known, so using the Bellman equation once we can calculate formula_53, and so on until we get to formula_54, which is the &quot;value&quot; of the initial decision problem for the whole lifetime. In other words, once we know formula_55, we can calculate formula_56, which is the maximum of formula_57, where formula_58 is the choice variable and formula_59.

Working backwards, it can be shown that the value function at time formula_60 is

: formula_61

where each formula_62 is a constant, and the optimal amount to consume at time formula_60 is

: formula_64

which can be simplified to

: formula_65

We see that it is optimal to consume a larger fraction of current wealth as one gets older, finally consuming all remaining wealth in period , the last period of life.

=== Computer science ===
There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to &quot;non-overlapping&quot; sub-problems, the strategy is called &quot;divide and conquer&quot; instead. This is why merge sort and quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems.

&quot;Optimal substructure&quot; means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of recursion. For example, given a graph &quot;G=(V,E)&quot;, the shortest path &quot;p&quot; from a vertex &quot;u&quot; to a vertex &quot;v&quot; exhibits optimal substructure: take any intermediate vertex &quot;w&quot; on this shortest path &quot;p&quot;. If &quot;p&quot; is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths &quot;p1&quot; from &quot;u&quot; to &quot;w&quot; and &quot;p2&quot; from &quot;w&quot; to &quot;v&quot; such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot;). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the Bellman–Ford algorithm or the Floyd–Warshall algorithm does.

&quot;Overlapping&quot; sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci sequence: &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1 + &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot;−2, with base case &quot;F&quot;1 = &quot;F&quot;2 = 1. Then &quot;F&quot;43 = &quot;F&quot;42 + &quot;F&quot;41, and &quot;F&quot;42 = &quot;F&quot;41 + &quot;F&quot;40. Now &quot;F&quot;41 is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both &quot;F&quot;43 as well as &quot;F&quot;42. Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.

This can be achieved in either of two ways:

* &quot;Top-down approach&quot;: This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table (often an array or hashtable in practice). Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.
* &quot;Bottom-up approach&quot;: Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of &quot;F&quot;41 and &quot;F&quot;40, we can directly calculate the value of &quot;F&quot;42.

Some programming languages can automatically memoize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up call-by-name evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as &quot;call-by-need&quot;). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. Scheme, Common Lisp, Perl or D). Some languages have automatic memoization built in, such as tabled Prolog and J, which supports memoization with the &quot;M.&quot; adverb. In any case, this is only possible for a referentially transparent function. Memoization is also encountered as an easily accessible design pattern within term-rewrite based languages such as Wolfram Language.

=== Bioinformatics ===
Dynamic programming is widely used in bioinformatics for tasks such as sequence alignment, protein folding, RNA structure prediction and protein-DNA binding. The first dynamic programming algorithms for protein-DNA binding were developed in the 1970s independently by Charles DeLisi in the US and by Georgii Gurskii and Alexander Zasedatelev in the Soviet Union. Recently these algorithms have become very popular in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly in the studies of nucleosome positioning and transcription factor binding.

== Examples: computer algorithms ==

=== Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm for the shortest path problem ===
From a dynamic programming point of view, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm for the shortest path problem is a successive approximation scheme that solves the dynamic programming functional equation for the shortest path problem by the Reaching method.

In fact, Dijkstra&#x27;s explanation of the logic behind the algorithm, namely
is a paraphrasing of Bellman&#x27;s famous Principle of Optimality in the context of the shortest path problem.

=== Fibonacci sequence ===
Using dynamic programming in the calculation of the &quot;n&quot;th member of the Fibonacci sequence improves its performance greatly. Here is a naïve implementation, based directly on the mathematical definition:

 function fib(n)
 if n &lt;= 1 return n
 return fib(n − 1) + fib(n − 2)

Notice that if we call, say, codice_1, we produce a call tree that calls the function on the same value many different times:

# codice_1
# codice_3
# codice_4
# codice_5
# codice_6

In particular, codice_7 was calculated three times from scratch. In larger examples, many more values of codice_8, or &quot;subproblems&quot;, are recalculated, leading to an exponential time algorithm.

Now, suppose we have a simple map object, &quot;m&quot;, which maps each value of codice_8 that has already been calculated to its result, and we modify our function to use it and update it. The resulting function requires only O(&quot;n&quot;) time instead of exponential time (but requires O(&quot;n&quot;) space):

 var m := map(0 → 0, 1 → 1)
 function fib(n)
 if &quot;key n is not in &quot;map m 
 m[n] := fib(n − 1) + fib(n − 2)
 return m[n]

This technique of saving values that have already been calculated is called &quot;memoization&quot;; this is the top-down approach, since we first break the problem into subproblems and then calculate and store values.

In the bottom-up approach, we calculate the smaller values of codice_8 first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(&quot;n&quot;) time since it contains a loop that repeats n − 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, in contrast to the top-down approach which requires O(&quot;n&quot;) space to store the map.

 function fib(n)
 if n = 0
 return 0
 else
 var previousFib := 0, currentFib := 1
 repeat n − 1 times &quot;// loop is skipped if n = 1&quot;
 var newFib := previousFib + currentFib
 previousFib := currentFib
 currentFib := newFib
 return currentFib

In both examples, we only calculate codice_7 one time, and then use it to calculate both codice_12 and codice_13, instead of computing it every time either of them is evaluated.

=== A type of balanced 0–1 matrix ===

Consider the problem of assigning values, either zero or one, to the positions of an matrix, with even, so that each row and each column contains exactly zeros and ones. We ask how many different assignments there are for a given formula_19. For example, when , five possible solutions are

:formula_67

There are at least three possible approaches: brute force, backtracking, and dynamic programming.

Brute force consists of checking all assignments of zeros and ones and counting those that have balanced rows and columns ( zeros and ones). As there are formula_68 possible assignments and formula_69 sensible assignments, this strategy is not practical except maybe up to formula_70.

Backtracking for this problem consists of choosing some order of the matrix elements and recursively placing ones or zeros, while checking that in every row and column the number of elements that have not been assigned plus the number of ones or zeros are both at least . While more sophisticated than brute force, this approach will visit every solution once, making it impractical for larger than six, since the number of solutions is already 116,963,796,250 for  = 8, as we shall see.

Dynamic programming makes it possible to count the number of solutions without visiting them all. Imagine backtracking values for the first row – what information would we require about the remaining rows, in order to be able to accurately count the solutions obtained for each first row value? We consider boards, where , whose formula_18 rows contain formula_72 zeros and formula_72 ones. The function &quot;f&quot; to which memoization is applied maps vectors of &quot;n&quot; pairs of integers to the number of admissible boards (solutions). There is one pair for each column, and its two components indicate respectively the number of zeros and ones that have yet to be placed in that column. We seek the value of formula_74 (formula_19 arguments or one vector of formula_19 elements). The process of subproblem creation involves iterating over every one of formula_77 possible assignments for the top row of the board, and going through every column, subtracting one from the appropriate element of the pair for that column, depending on whether the assignment for the top row contained a zero or a one at that position. If any one of the results is negative, then the assignment is invalid and does not contribute to the set of solutions (recursion stops). Otherwise, we have an assignment for the top row of the board and recursively compute the number of solutions to the remaining board, adding the numbers of solutions for every admissible assignment of the top row and returning the sum, which is being memoized. The base case is the trivial subproblem, which occurs for a board. The number of solutions for this board is either zero or one, depending on whether the vector is a permutation of formula_78 and formula_79 pairs or not.

For example, in the first two boards shown above the sequences of vectors would be
The number of solutions is

:formula_80

=== Checkerboard ===

Consider a checkerboard with &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; squares and a cost function codice_14 which returns a cost associated with square codice_15 (codice_16 being the row, codice_17 being the column). For instance (on a 5 × 5 checkerboard),
Thus codice_18

Let us say there was a checker that could start at any square on the first rank (i.e., row) and you wanted to know the shortest path (the sum of the minimum costs at each visited rank) to get to the last rank; assuming the checker could move only diagonally left forward, diagonally right forward, or straight forward. That is, a checker on codice_19 can move to codice_20, codice_21 or codice_22.
This problem exhibits optimal substructure. That is, the solution to the entire problem relies on solutions to subproblems. Let us define a function codice_23 as

:&quot;q&quot;(&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;) = the minimum cost to reach square (&quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;).

Starting at rank codice_24 and descending to rank codice_25, we compute the value of this function for all the squares at each successive rank. Picking the square that holds the minimum value at each rank gives us the shortest path between rank codice_24 and rank codice_25.

The function codice_23 is equal to the minimum cost to get to any of the three squares below it (since those are the only squares that can reach it) plus codice_14. For instance:

: formula_81

Now, let us define codice_23 in somewhat more general terms:

: formula_82

The first line of this equation deals with a board modeled as squares indexed on codice_25 at the lowest bound and codice_24 at the highest bound. The second line specifies what happens at the first rank; providing a base case. The third line, the recursion, is the important part. It represents the codice_33 terms in the example. From this definition we can derive straightforward recursive code for codice_34. In the following pseudocode, codice_24 is the size of the board, codice_14 is the cost function, and codice_37 returns the minimum of a number of values:

 function minCost(i, j)
 if j &lt; 1 or j &gt; n
 return infinity
 else if i = 1
 return c(i, j)
 else
 return min( minCost(i-1, j-1), minCost(i-1, j), minCost(i-1, j+1) ) + c(i, j)

This function only computes the path cost, not the actual path. We discuss the actual path below. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow because it too exhibits the overlapping sub-problems attribute. That is, it recomputes the same path costs over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path costs in a two-dimensional array codice_38 rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; all the values needed for array codice_38 are computed ahead of time only once. Precomputed values for codice_15 are simply looked up whenever needed.

We also need to know what the actual shortest path is. To do this, we use another array codice_41; a &quot;predecessor array&quot;. This array records the path to any square codice_42. The predecessor of codice_42 is modeled as an offset relative to the index (in codice_38) of the precomputed path cost of codice_42. To reconstruct the complete path, we lookup the predecessor of codice_42, then the predecessor of that square, then the predecessor of that square, and so on recursively, until we reach the starting square. Consider the following pseudocode:

 function computeShortestPathArrays()
 for x from 1 to n
 q[1, x] := c(1, x)
 for y from 1 to n
 q[y, 0] := infinity
 q[y, n + 1] := infinity
 for y from 2 to n
 for x from 1 to n
 m := min(q[y-1, x-1], q[y-1, x], q[y-1, x+1])
 q[y, x] := m + c(y, x)
 if m = q[y-1, x-1]
 p[y, x] := -1
 else if m = q[y-1, x]
 p[y, x] := 0
 else
 p[y, x] := 1

Now the rest is a simple matter of finding the minimum and printing it.

 function computeShortestPath()
 computeShortestPathArrays()
 minIndex := 1
 min := q[n, 1]
 for i from 2 to n
 if q[n, i] &lt; min
 minIndex := i
 min := q[n, i]
 printPath(n, minIndex)

 function printPath(y, x)
 print(x)
 print(&quot;&lt;-&quot;)
 if y = 2
 print(x + p[y, x])
 else
 printPath(y-1, x + p[y, x])

=== Sequence alignment ===
In genetics, sequence alignment is an important application where dynamic programming is essential. Typically, the problem consists of transforming one sequence into another using edit operations that replace, insert, or remove an element. Each operation has an associated cost, and the goal is to find the sequence of edits with the lowest total cost.

The problem can be stated naturally as a recursion, a sequence A is optimally edited into a sequence B by either:

# inserting the first character of B, and performing an optimal alignment of A and the tail of B
# deleting the first character of A, and performing the optimal alignment of the tail of A and B
# replacing the first character of A with the first character of B, and performing optimal alignments of the tails of A and B.

The partial alignments can be tabulated in a matrix, where cell (i,j) contains the cost of the optimal alignment of A[1..i] to B[1..j]. The cost in cell (i,j) can be calculated by adding the cost of the relevant operations to the cost of its neighboring cells, and selecting the optimum.

Different variants exist, see Smith–Waterman algorithm and Needleman–Wunsch algorithm.

=== Tower of Hanoi puzzle ===
The Tower of Hanoi or Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:

* Only one disk may be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The dynamic programming solution consists of solving the functional equation

: S(n,h,t) = S(n-1,h, not(h,t)) ; S(1,h,t) ; S(n-1,not(h,t),t)

where n denotes the number of disks to be moved, h denotes the home rod, t denotes the target rod, not(h,t) denotes the third rod (neither h nor t), &quot;;&quot; denotes concatenation, and

: S(n, h, t) := solution to a problem consisting of n disks that are to be moved from rod h to rod t.

For n=1 the problem is trivial, namely S(1,h,t) = &quot;move a disk from rod h to rod t&quot; (there is only one disk left).

The number of moves required by this solution is 2&quot;n&quot; − 1. If the objective is to maximize the number of moves (without cycling) then the dynamic programming functional equation is slightly more complicated and 3&quot;n&quot; − 1 moves are required.

=== Egg dropping puzzle ===
The following is a description of the instance of this famous puzzle involving N=2 eggs and a building with H=36 floors: 
:Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 36-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing (using U.S. English terminology, in which the first floor is at ground level). We make a few assumptions:

:* An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
:* A broken egg must be discarded.
:* The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
:* If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher window.
:* If an egg survives a fall, then it would survive a shorter fall.
:* It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that eggs can survive the 36th-floor windows.

: If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be carried out in only one way. Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 36 droppings. Suppose 2 eggs are available. What is the lowest number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?

To derive a dynamic programming functional equation for this puzzle, let the state of the dynamic programming model be a pair s = (n,k), where

: &quot;n&quot; = number of test eggs available, &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., &quot;N&quot; − 1.
: &quot;k&quot; = number of (consecutive) floors yet to be tested, &quot;k&quot; = 0, 1, 2, ..., &quot;H&quot; − 1.

For instance, &quot;s&quot; = (2,6) indicates that two test eggs are available and 6 (consecutive) floors are yet to be tested. The initial state of the process is &quot;s&quot; = (&quot;N&quot;,&quot;H&quot;) where &quot;N&quot; denotes the number of test eggs available at the commencement of the experiment. The process terminates either when there are no more test eggs (&quot;n&quot; = 0) or when &quot;k&quot; = 0, whichever occurs first. If termination occurs at state &quot;s&quot; = (0,&quot;k&quot;) and &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0, then the test failed.

Now, let

: &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) = minimum number of trials required to identify the value of the critical floor under the worst-case scenario given that the process is in state &quot;s&quot; = (&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;).

Then it can be shown that

: &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) = 1 + min{max(&quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot; − 1, &quot;x&quot; − 1), &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot; − &quot;x&quot;)): &quot;x&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot; }

with &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,0) = 0 for all &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;W&quot;(1,&quot;k&quot;) = &quot;k&quot; for all &quot;k&quot;. It is easy to solve this equation iteratively by systematically increasing the values of &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot;.

==== Faster DP solution using a different parametrization ====
Notice that the above solution takes formula_83 time with a DP solution. This can be improved to formula_84 time by binary searching on the optimal formula_85 in the above recurrence, since formula_86 is increasing in formula_85 while formula_88 is decreasing in formula_85, thus a local minimum of formula_90 is a global minimum. Also, by storing the optimal formula_85 for each cell in the DP table and referring to its value for the previous cell, the optimal formula_85 for each cell can be found in constant time, improving it to formula_93 time. However, there is an even faster solution that involves a different parametrization of the problem:

Let formula_18 be the total number of floors such that the eggs break when dropped from the formula_18th floor (The example above is equivalent to taking formula_96).

Let formula_97 be the minimum floor from which the egg must be dropped to be broken.

Let formula_98 be the maximum number of values of formula_97 that are distinguishable using formula_13 tries and formula_19 eggs.

Then formula_102 for all formula_103.

Let formula_104 be the floor from which the first egg is dropped in the optimal strategy.

If the first egg broke, formula_97 is from formula_106 to formula_104 and distinguishable using at most formula_108 tries and formula_109 eggs.

If the first egg did not break, formula_97 is from formula_111 to formula_18 and distinguishable using formula_108 tries and formula_19 eggs.

Therefore, formula_115.

Then the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum formula_85 such that formula_117.

To do so, we could compute formula_118 in order of increasing formula_13, which would take formula_120 time.

Thus, if we separately handle the case of formula_121, the algorithm would take formula_122 time.

But the recurrence relation can in fact be solved, giving formula_123, which can be computed in formula_124 time using the identity formula_125 for all formula_126.

Since formula_127 for all formula_128, we can binary search on formula_13 to find formula_85, giving an formula_131 algorithm.

=== Matrix chain multiplication ===


Matrix chain multiplication is a well-known example that demonstrates utility of dynamic programming. For example, engineering applications often have to multiply a chain of matrices. It is not surprising to find matrices of large dimensions, for example 100×100. Therefore, our task is to multiply matrices . Matrix multiplication is not commutative, but is associative; and we can multiply only two matrices at a time. So, we can multiply this chain of matrices in many different ways, for example:



and so on. There are numerous ways to multiply this chain of matrices. They will all produce the same final result, however they will take more or less time to compute, based on which particular matrices are multiplied. If matrix A has dimensions m×n and matrix B has dimensions n×q, then matrix C=A×B will have dimensions m×q, and will require m*n*q scalar multiplications (using a simplistic matrix multiplication algorithm for purposes of illustration).

For example, let us multiply matrices A, B and C. Let us assume that their dimensions are m×n, n×p, and p×s, respectively. Matrix A×B×C will be of size m×s and can be calculated in two ways shown below:

# Ax(B×C) This order of matrix multiplication will require nps + mns scalar multiplications. 
# (A×B)×C This order of matrix multiplication will require mnp + mps scalar calculations.

Let us assume that m = 10, n = 100, p = 10 and s = 1000. So, the first way to multiply the chain will require 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 calculations. The second way will require only 10,000+100,000 calculations. Obviously, the second way is faster, and we should multiply the matrices using that arrangement of parenthesis.

Therefore, our conclusion is that the order of parenthesis matters, and that our task is to find the optimal order of parenthesis.

At this point, we have several choices, one of which is to design a dynamic programming algorithm that will split the problem into overlapping problems and calculate the optimal arrangement of parenthesis. The dynamic programming solution is presented below.

Let&#x27;s call m[i,j] the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices from matrix i to matrix j (i.e. Ai × ... × Aj, i.e. i&lt;=j). We split the chain at some matrix k, such that i &lt;= k &lt; j, and try to find out which combination produces minimum m[i,j].

The formula is:

 if i = j, m[i,j]= 0
 if i &lt; j, m[i,j]= min over all possible values of k 
where &quot;k&quot; ranges from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot; − 1.

* is the row dimension of matrix i,
* is the column dimension of matrix k,
* is the column dimension of matrix j.

This formula can be coded as shown below, where input parameter &quot;chain&quot; is the chain of matrices, i.e. :

 function OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain)
 n = length(chain)
 for i = 1, n
 m[i,i] = 0 &quot;// Since it takes no calculations to multiply one matrix&quot;
 for len = 2, n
 for i = 1, n - len + 1
 j = i + len -1
 m[i,j] = infinity &quot;// So that the first calculation updates&quot;
 for k = i, j-1
 if q &lt; m[i, j] &quot;// The new order of parentheses is better than what we had&quot;
 m[i, j] = q &quot;// Update&quot;
 s[i, j] = k &quot;// Record which k to split on, i.e. where to place the parenthesis&quot;

So far, we have calculated values for all possible , the minimum number of calculations to multiply a chain from matrix &quot;i&quot; to matrix &quot;j&quot;, and we have recorded the corresponding &quot;split point&quot;. For example, if we are multiplying chain , and it turns out that and , that means that the optimal placement of parenthesis for matrices 1 to 3 is and to multiply those matrices will require 100 scalar calculations.

This algorithm will produce &quot;tables&quot; &quot;m&quot;[, ] and &quot;s&quot;[, ] that will have entries for all possible values of i and j. The final solution for the entire chain is m[1, n], with corresponding split at s[1, n]. Unraveling the solution will be recursive, starting from the top and continuing until we reach the base case, i.e. multiplication of single matrices.

Therefore, the next step is to actually split the chain, i.e. to place the parenthesis where they (optimally) belong. For this purpose we could use the following algorithm:

 function PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, j)
 if i = j
 print &quot;A&quot;i
 else
 print &quot;(&quot; 
 PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, s[i, j]) 
 PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, s[i, j] + 1, j) 
 print &quot;)&quot;

Of course, this algorithm is not useful for actual multiplication. This algorithm is just a user-friendly way to see what the result looks like.

To actually multiply the matrices using the proper splits, we need the following algorithm:

 function MatrixChainMultiply(chain from 1 to n) // returns the final matrix, i.e. A1×A2×... ×An
 OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain from 1 to n) // this will produce s[ . ] and m[ . ] &quot;tables&quot;
 OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, chain from 1 to n) // actually multiply

 function OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, j) // returns the result of multiplying a chain of matrices from Ai to Aj in optimal way
 if i &lt; j
 // keep on splitting the chain and multiplying the matrices in left and right sides
 LeftSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, s[i, j])
 RightSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, s[i, j] + 1, j)
 return MatrixMultiply(LeftSide, RightSide) 
 else if i = j
 return Ai // matrix at position i
 else 
 print &quot;error, i &lt;= j must hold&quot;

 function MatrixMultiply(A, B) // function that multiplies two matrices
 if columns(A) = rows(B) 
 for i = 1, rows(A)
 for j = 1, columns(B)
 C[i, j] = 0
 for k = 1, columns(A)
 C[i, j] = C[i, j] + A[i, k]*B[k, j] 
 return C 
 else 
 print &quot;error, incompatible dimensions.&quot;
== History of the name ==
The term &quot;dynamic programming&quot; was originally used in the 1940s by Richard Bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another. By 1953, he refined this to the modern meaning, referring specifically to nesting smaller decision problems inside larger decisions, and the field was thereafter recognized by the IEEE as a systems analysis and engineering topic. Bellman&#x27;s contribution is remembered in the name of the Bellman equation, a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form.

Bellman explains the reasoning behind the term &quot;dynamic programming&quot; in his autobiography, &quot;Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography&quot;:

The word &quot;dynamic&quot; was chosen by Bellman to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems, and because it sounded impressive. The word &quot;programming&quot; referred to the use of the method to find an optimal &quot;program&quot;, in the sense of a military schedule for training or logistics. This usage is the same as that in the phrases &quot;linear programming&quot; and &quot;mathematical programming&quot;, a synonym for mathematical optimization.

The above explanation of the origin of the term may be inaccurate: According to Russell and Norvig, the above story &quot;cannot be strictly true, because his first paper using the term (Bellman, 1952) appeared before Wilson became Secretary of Defense in 1953.&quot; Also, Harold J. Kushner stated in a speech that, &quot;On the other hand, when I asked [Bellman] the same question, he replied that he was trying to upstage Dantzig&#x27;s linear programming by adding dynamic. Perhaps both motivations were true.&quot;

<text>Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy is, along with the Bible, one of two central texts of the Christian Science religion. Eddy described it as her &quot;most important work.&quot; She began writing it in February 1872, and the first edition was published in 1875. She would continue editing it and adding to it for the rest of her life.

The book was selected as one of the &quot;75 Books By Women Whose Words Have Changed The World&quot;, by the Women&#x27;s National Book Association.

In 2001 the book had sold over nine million copies, and as of 2024, it eclipsed ten million copies.

==Overview==
Christian Science develops its theology and its healing method in &quot;Science and Health&quot; and defines God as &quot;incorporeal, divine, supreme, infinite Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, Love&quot;. Eddy saw Jesus&#x27; healing work as a divinely natural and repeatable science. According to Stephen Gottschalk, Eddy &quot;saw the healing ministry of Christian Science as helping to rouse Christians to the great promise of restoring the power of the original Gospel.&quot;

&quot;Science and Health&quot; encapsulates the teachings of Christian Science and adherents often call it their &quot;textbook.&quot; At Sunday services, the sermon consists of passages from the Bible with correlative passages from &quot;Science and Health&quot;. Eddy called the two books Christian Science&#x27;s &quot;dual and impersonal pastor.&quot;

==Structure==
The last edition of the book consists of a short preface, the main section, a &quot;Key to the Scriptures&quot; section, and a Fruitage section. Some editions include a word index.

===Main section===

The main section is 500 pages long and comprises chapters titled as follows:

* Prayer
* Atonement and Eucharist
* Marriage
* Christian Science versus Spiritualism
* Animal Magnetism Unmasked
* Science, Theology, Medicine
* Physiology
* Footsteps of Truth
* Creation
* Science of Being
* Some Objections Answered
* Christian Science Practice (which explains how healing is undertaken)
* Teaching Christian Science
* Recapitulation (the text used for class instruction in Christian Science healing).

=== Key to the Scriptures ===
This section is 100 pages long, and comprises:
* Genesis (a detailed analysis of the two versions of the creation story given in the book of Genesis)
* The Apocalypse (an analysis of parts of the book of Revelation)
* Glossary (giving the spiritual meaning of 114 Biblical terms)

=== Fruitage ===
This section is 100 pages long and consists of 84 testimonies of the healing power derived from reading &quot;Science and Health&quot;. There are descriptions of healings of addiction, asthma, broken bones, cataracts, cancer, deafness, eczema, fibroid tumor, and rheumatism. Prior intervention by physicians is mentioned in 50 of these cases, and one relates a confirmatory X-ray image by a physician.

Marietta T. Webb, who in 1911 became one of the first African Americans listed in the Christian Science Journal as a practitioner, became the only African American to have a healing testimony included in the Fruitage section of &quot;Science and Health&quot;.

==Copyright==
The first edition was copyrighted by Eddy in 1875, in part to help separate her work from the &quot;sea of metaphysical writing&quot; circulating at the time. The copyright for &quot;Science and Health&quot; went through several renewals including a posthumous renewal in 1934 by the Christian Science Board of Directors. In December 1971, Congress passed a law extending the copyright on &quot;Science and Health&quot; by 75 years to the Christian Science Board of Directors. There was some opposition to the bill, as it would prevent dissident groups from publishing their own edited versions of the book.

In 1985 however, following a legal suit brought by United Christian Scientists, a group which wanted to publish their own version of the book, the copyright extension was found unconstitutional by Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. In 1987 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the ruling of the district court. As a result, &quot;Science and Health&quot; has been in the public domain since 1987.

==Editions==

The first edition was published in 1875 by Eddy, who was then in her mid-fifties and known as Mary Baker Glover. It was printed by W.F. Brown &amp; Co. Their invoice for 1,000 copies, dated October 30, 1875, was made out to George M. Barry and Edward Hitchins for US$2,285.35. The edition consisted of 456 pages, plus 2 pages of errata. However, there were hundreds of typographic errors, some because the printer, not understanding the author&#x27;s meaning, had tried to correct the wording without consulting her. The second edition, printed by Rand, Avery &amp; Co, appeared in 1878, with 167 pages of new material. It was called &quot;Science and Health Volume 2&quot; to indicate that it was a supplement to the first edition, but it, too, was full of typographic errors. Finally, the third edition printed by John Wilson at the University Press in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was of a high standard. Twelve further two-volume editions followed, before the 16th edition appeared as a single volume in 1886. This edition of the book had 552 pages, plus an index of 38 pages, and &quot;with Key to the Scriptures&quot; had been added to the title. Eddy remained loyal to the University Press for the rest of her life, and in 1897 even made a substantial investment to save it from bankruptcy.

Eddy closed her Massachusetts Metaphysical College and left Boston in 1889, in order to revise the text for the 50th edition (1891). This edition consisted of 578 pages plus a 73-page index, and for the first time included marginal headings. The 226th &quot;thousand&quot; edition appeared in 1902, and included the chapter &quot;Fruitage,&quot; making up the page count of 700 pages which remains to this day. The last numbered edition was the 418th, which appeared in 1906, but further changes were made until 1910. According to the Mary Baker Eddy Library, major editions include those printed in 1875, 1878, 1881, 1883, 1886, 1891, 1902, and 1907.

Many sources overlook the importance of this book in its finalized form in 1910. It is well known as the foundational guidance for the Church of Christ, Scientist, but the book also managed to stir up questions about issues that so many male religious leaders and thinkers believed they had settled. In writing about the first edition of &quot;Science and Health&quot;, feminist scholar and biographer Gillian Gill homes in on this point: &quot;The real issue is the author&#x27;s audacity, her daring to think that a woman like her, with her resources, could write, not the expected textbook on mental healing techniques, not the comfortable compendium of healing anecdotes, but a book that takes on the great questions of God and man, good and evil, and that rejects orthodox verities.&quot;

<text>Mary Baker Eddy (nee Baker; July 16, 1821 – December 3, 1910) was an American religious leader, Christian healer, and author, who in 1879 founded The Church of Christ, Scientist, the &quot;Mother Church&quot; of the Christian Science movement. She also founded &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; in 1908, and three religious magazines: the &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot;, &quot;The Christian Science Journal&quot;, and &quot;The Herald of Christian Science&quot;.

Eddy wrote numerous books and articles, most notably the 1875 book &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot;, selected as one of the &quot;75 Books By Women Whose Words Have Changed The World&quot; by the Women&#x27;s National Book Association. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1995.

Other works Eddy authored include &quot;Manual of The Mother Church&quot;, and a collection of varied writings that were consolidated posthumously into a book called &quot;Prose Works&quot;.

== Early life ==
=== Bow, New Hampshire ===
==== Family ====

Eddy was born Mary Morse Baker on July 16, 1821, in a farmhouse in Bow, New Hampshire to farmer Mark Baker (d. 1865) and his wife Abigail Barnard Baker, née Ambrose (d. 1849). Eddy was the youngest of six children: boys Samuel Dow (1808), Albert (1810), and George Sullivan (1812), followed by girls Abigail Barnard (1816), Martha Smith (1819), and Mary Morse (1821). She was the cousin of U.S. Representative Henry M. Baker.

She was the sixth generation of her family born in the United States. The farmhouse she was born in was built by her grandfather, Joseph Baker Jr., on a tract of land his maternal grandfather, Captain John Lovewell, had been given for service in the American Revolutionary War. Eddy&#x27;s father Mark inherited, alongside his elder brother James, the farm when Joseph Jr. died in 1816.

A staunch Calvinist, Mark Baker was an active member of the Tilton Congregationalist Church. &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; reported he had a reputation for holding strong opinions and quarreling with those he disagreed with; one neighbor described him as &quot;[a] tiger for a temper and always in a row.&quot; They also claimed he was an ardent supporter of slavery and a Copperhead who was reportedly pleased to hear about Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s death. Despite trying to oust his Republican pastor during the war alongside a faction of his church, he refused to leave the church alongside other members of the faction when they failed. Instead, he continued to attend services, but would storm out at the mention of the American Civil War during a service.
Eddy and her father reportedly had a volatile relationship. Ernest Sutherland Bates and John V. Dittemore wrote in 1932 that Baker sought to break Eddy&#x27;s will with harsh punishment, although her mother often intervened; in contrast to the strict religiosity of her father, Eddy&#x27;s mother was described as devout, quiet, light-hearted and nurturing, and a benevolent spiritual influence on Eddy in her formative years.

==== Health ====
Eddy experienced periods of sudden illness. Those who knew the family described her as suddenly falling to the floor, writhing and screaming, or silent and apparently unconscious, sometimes for hours. Historian Robert Peel wrote that these fits would require the family to send Eddy to the village doctor.

The cause for Eddy&#x27;s illness was unclear, but biographer Caroline Fraser wrote she believed the cause was most likely psychogenic in nature. According to psychoanalyst Julius Silberger, Eddy may have been motivated to have these fits in an effort to control her father&#x27;s attitude toward her. Fraser attributed the illness likely to a combination of hypochondria and histrionics as well.

=== Tilton, New Hampshire ===

In 1836, when Eddy was about 14 to 15 years old, she moved with her family to the town of Sanbornton Bridge, New Hampshire, approximately north of Bow. Sanbornton Bridge was renamed in 1869 as Tilton, New Hampshire.

Ernest Bates and John Dittemore write that Eddy was not able to attend Sanbornton Academy when the family first moved there but was required instead to start at the district school (in the same building) with the youngest girls. She withdrew after a month because of poor health, then received private tuition from the Reverend Enoch Corser. She entered Sanbornton Academy in 1842.

She was received into the Congregational church in Tilton on July 26, 1838, when she was 17, according to church records published by Cather and Milmine. Eddy had written in her autobiography in 1891 that she was 12 when this happened, and that she had discussed the idea of predestination with the pastor during the examination for her membership; this may have been an attempt to mirror the story of a 12-year-old Jesus in the Temple.

=== Marriage, widowhood ===

Eddy was badly affected by four deaths in the 1840s. She regarded her brother Albert as a teacher and mentor, but he died in 1841. In 1844, her first husband George Washington Glover (a friend of her brother Samuel) died after six months of marriage. They had married in December 1843 and set up home in Charleston, South Carolina, where Glover had business, but he died of yellow fever in June 1844 while living in Wilmington, North Carolina. Eddy was with him in Wilmington, six months pregnant. She had to make her way back to New Hampshire, by train and steamboat, where her only child George Washington Glover II was born on September 12 in her father&#x27;s home.

Her husband&#x27;s death, the journey back, and the birth left her physically and mentally exhausted, and she ended up bedridden for months. As Eddy was unable to care for him, her son was nursed by a local woman while Eddy herself was cared for by a household servant.

Eddy&#x27;s mother died in November 1849. Her mother&#x27;s death was then followed three weeks later by the death of Eddy&#x27;s fiancé, lawyer John Bartlett.
Eddy&#x27;s father Mark Baker remarried in 1850; his second wife Elizabeth Patterson Duncan (d. June 6, 1875) had been widowed twice, and had some property and income from her second marriage. Baker apparently made clear to Eddy that her son would not be welcome in the new marital home.

== Early influences ==
=== Study with Phineas Quimby ===

Eddy married Dr. Daniel Patterson, a dentist, in 1853. Mesmerism had become popular in New England; and on October 14, 1861, Patterson, wrote to mesmerist Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, who reportedly cured people without medicine, asking if he could cure his wife. Quimby replied that he had too much work in Portland, Maine and that he could not visit her, but if Patterson brought his wife to him he would treat her. Eddy did not immediately go, instead trying the water cure at Dr. Vail&#x27;s Hydropathic Institute, but her health deteriorated even further. A year later, in October 1862, Eddy first visited Quimby. She improved considerably, and publicly declared that she had been able to walk up 182 steps to the dome of city hall after a week of treatment. The cures were temporary, however, and Eddy suffered relapses.

Despite the temporary nature of the &quot;cure&quot;, she attached religious significance to it, which Quimby did not. Eddy believed that it was the same type of healing performed by Christ Jesus, who, unlike Quimby, administered no medicine or material means in his healings. From 1862 to 1865, Quimby and Eddy engaged in lengthy discussions about healing methods like hydropathy practiced by Quimby and others. She took notes on her own views of healing, as well as writing dictations from him and &quot;correcting&quot; them with her own ideas, some of which possibly ended up in the &quot;Quimby manuscripts&quot; that were published later and attributed to him. Furthering the case that Eddy had likely written large portions of Quimby&#x27;s manuscripts, Quimby was notably &quot;illiterate&quot; and would never have had the ability to write his ideas down himself. Despite Quimby not being especially religious, he embraced the religious connotations Eddy was bringing to his work since he knew his more religious patients would appreciate it. Phineas Quimby died on January 16, 1866, shortly after Eddy&#x27;s father.
J. Gordon Melton has argued &quot;certainly Eddy shared some ideas with Quimby. She differed with him in some key areas, however, such as specific healing techniques. Moreover, she did not share Quimby&#x27;s hostility toward the Bible and Christianity.&quot; Biographer Gillian Gill has disagreed with other scholars arguing they &quot;have flouted the evidence and shown willful bias in accusing Mrs. Eddy of owing her theory of healing to Quimby and of plagiarizing his unpublished work.&quot;

===1866 fall===
On February 1, 1866, while living in Lynn, Massachusetts, Eddy slipped and fell on a patch of ice. A contemporary account by the Lynn &quot;Reporter&quot; stated:

When Georgine Milmine interviewed Dr. Cushing forty years later, he stated that his records from the time documented that Eddy was in a &quot;semi-hysterical&quot; intense emotional state which subsided after she was given a small amount of morphine.

On February 14, 1866, the day after Eddy finished her care with Dr. Cushing, Eddy wrote to Julius Dresser, another patient of Phineas Quimby, claiming that her injury and her subsequent medical care had undone all of the healing that Quimby had done before, and requested that he heal her. Dresser refused, stating that he was not enough to take on the burden of healing, and urged Eddy to instead spread Quimby&#x27;s teachings further. Eddy would later credit her accident as her moment of spiritual revelation and the &quot;falling apple&quot; that led to her discovery of Christian Science. She claimed that after rejecting the medicines offered to her by her doctor, she opened her Bible three days after her fall and returned to full health after reading of Jesus healing the sick.

=== Spiritualism ===
Eddy separated from her second husband Daniel Patterson in 1866, after which she boarded for four years with several families in Lynn, Massachusetts and elsewhere. Frank Podmore wrote:


According to Peel, spiritualists were &quot;eager to claim her as one of their own.&quot; After she became well known, reports surfaced that Eddy had been a medium years earlier in Boston and St. Louis. However, at the time when she was said to be a medium there, she lived some distance away in North Groton, where she was bedridden. According to Gill, Eddy knew spiritualists and took part in some of their activities, but was never a convinced believer. For example, she visited her friend Sarah Crosby in 1864, who believed in Spiritualism. According to Sibyl Wilbur, Eddy attempted to show Crosby the folly of it by pretending to channel Eddy&#x27;s dead brother Albert and writing letters which she attributed to him. In regard to the deception, biographer Hugh Evelyn Wortham stated &quot;Mrs. Eddy&#x27;s followers explain it all as a pleasantry on her part to cure Mrs. Crosby of her credulous belief in spiritualism.&quot; However, Martin Gardner has argued against this, stating that Eddy was working as a spiritualist medium and was convinced by the messages. According to Gardner, Eddy&#x27;s mediumship converted Crosby to Spiritualism.

In one of her spiritualist trances to Crosby, Eddy gave a message that was supportive of Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, stating &quot;P. Quimby of Portland has the spiritual truth of diseases. You must imbibe it to be healed. Go to him again and lean on no material or spiritual medium.&quot; The paragraph that included this quote was later omitted from an official sanctioned biography of Eddy.

Between 1866 and 1870, Eddy boarded at the home of Brene Paine Clark who was interested in Spiritualism. Seances were often conducted there, but Eddy and Clark engaged in vigorous, good-natured arguments about them. Eddy&#x27;s arguments against Spiritualism convinced at least one other who was there at the time—Hiram Crafts—that &quot;her science was far superior to spirit teachings.&quot; Clark&#x27;s son George tried to convince Eddy to take up Spiritualism, but he said that she abhorred the idea. According to Cather and Milmine, Richard Hazeltine attended seances at Clark&#x27;s home, and Eddy had acted as a trance medium, claiming to channel the spirits of the Apostles.

Mary Gould, a Spiritualist from Lynn, claimed that one of the spirits that Eddy channeled was Abraham Lincoln. According to eyewitness reports cited by Cather and Milmine, Eddy was still attending séances as late as 1872. In these later séances, Eddy would attempt to convert her audience into accepting Christian Science. Eddy showed extensive familiarity with Spiritualist practice, but she denounced it in later Christian Science writings. Historian Ann Braude wrote that there were similarities between Spiritualism and Christian Science, but the main difference was that Eddy came to believe, after she founded Christian Science, that spirit manifestations had never really had bodies to begin with, because matter is unreal and that all that really exists is spirit, before and after death.

In the fiftieth edition of her book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, published in 1891, Eddy added the chapter, &quot;Christian Science and Spiritualism&quot;. This chapter was renamed in 1910 to &quot;Christian Science versus Spiritualism&quot;. 

==Building a church==

Eddy divorced Daniel Patterson for adultery in 1873. She published her work in 1875 in a book entitled &quot;Science and Health&quot; (years later retitled &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot;) which she called the textbook of Christian Science, after several years of offering her healing method. The first publication run was 1,000 copies, which she self-published. During these years, she taught what she considered the science of &quot;primitive Christianity&quot; and the &quot;lost art of healing&quot; to at least 800 people. Many of her students became healers themselves. The last 100 pages of &quot;Science and Health&quot; (chapter entitled &quot;Fruitage&quot;) contains testimonies of people who affirm to have been healed by reading her book. She made numerous revisions to her book from the time of its first publication until shortly before her death.
In January 1877, Eddy spurned an approach from one of her students, Daniel Spofford. She then married another student of hers, Asa Gilbert Eddy. On January 1, 1877, the two were wed, and she became Mary Baker Eddy in a small ceremony presided over by a Unitarian minister.

In 1881, Mary Baker Eddy started the Massachusetts Metaphysical College with a charter from the state which allowed her to grant degrees. In Spring 1882, the Eddys moved to Boston to Massachusetts Metaphysical College. Gilbert Eddy&#x27;s health began to decline around this time, and he died June 3 that year.
Eddy devoted the rest of her life to the establishment of the church, writing its bylaws, &quot;The Manual of The Mother Church&quot;, and revising &quot;Science and Health&quot;. By the 1870s, she was telling her students, &quot;Some day I will have a church of my own.&quot; In 1879, she and her students established the Church of Christ, Scientist, &quot;to commemorate the word and works of our Master [Jesus], which should reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing.&quot; In 1881, she founded the Massachusetts Metaphysical College, where she taught approximately 800 students between the years 1882 and 1889, when she closed it. Eddy charged her students $300 each for tuition, a large sum for the time. In 1892, at Eddy&#x27;s direction, the church reorganized as The First Church of Christ, Scientist. In 1894, an edifice for The First Church of Christ, Scientist was completed in Boston.

Her students spread across the country practicing healing, and instructing others. Eddy authorized these students to list themselves as Christian Science Practitioners in the church&#x27;s &quot;The Christian Science Journal&quot;. She also founded the &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot;, a weekly magazine with articles about how to heal and testimonies of healing.

When the church re-organized in 1892, Eddy was made the leader of the church as &quot;Pastor Emeritus&quot;. In 1895, she ordained the Bible and &quot;Science and Health&quot; as the pastor.

Eddy founded The Christian Science Publishing Society in 1898, which became the publishing home for numerous publications launched by her and her followers. In 1908, at the age of 87, she founded &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, a daily newspaper. She also founded the Christian Science Journal in 1883, a monthly magazine aimed at the church&#x27;s members and, in 1898, the &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot;, a weekly religious periodical written for a more general audience, and the &quot;Herald of Christian Science&quot;, a religious magazine with editions in many languages.

==Influences and teachings==
=== Malicious animal magnetism ===
The opposite of Christian Science mental healing was the use of mental powers for destructive or selfish reasons – for which Eddy used terms such as animal magnetism, hypnotism, or mesmerism interchangeably. &quot;Malicious animal magnetism&quot;, sometimes abbreviated as M.A.M., is what Catherine Albanese called &quot;a Calvinist devil lurking beneath the metaphysical surface&quot;. As there is no personal devil or evil in Christian Science, M.A.M. or mesmerism became the explanation for the problem of evil. Eddy was concerned that a new practitioner could inadvertently harm a patient through unenlightened use of their mental powers, and that less scrupulous individuals could use them as a weapon.

Animal magnetism became one of the most controversial aspects of Eddy&#x27;s life. The &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; biography spends a significant amount of time on malicious animal magnetism, which it uses to make the case that Eddy had paranoia. During the Next Friends lawsuit, it was used to charge Eddy with incompetence and &quot;general insanity&quot;.

According to Gillian Gill, Eddy&#x27;s experience with Richard Kennedy, one of her early students, was what led her to began her examination of malicious animal magnetism. Eddy had agreed to form a partnership with Kennedy in 1870, in which she would teach him how to heal, and he would take patients. The partnership was rather successful at first, but by 1872 Kennedy had fallen out with his teacher and torn up their contract. Although there were multiple issues raised, the main reason for the break according to Gill was Eddy&#x27;s insistence that Kennedy stop &quot;rubbing&quot; his patient&#x27;s head and solar plexus, which she saw as harmful since, as Gill states, &quot;traditionally in mesmerism or hypnosis the head and abdomen were manipulated so that the subject would be prepared to enter into trance.&quot; Kennedy clearly did believe in clairvoyance, mind reading, and absent mesmeric treatment; and after their split Eddy believed that Kennedy was using his mesmeric abilities to try to harm her and her movement.

In 1882, Eddy publicly claimed that her last husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, had died of &quot;mental assassination&quot;. Daniel Spofford was another Christian Scientist expelled by Eddy after she accused him of practicing malicious animal magnetism. This gained notoriety in a case irreverently dubbed the &quot;Second Salem Witch Trial&quot;.

Later, Eddy set up &quot;watches&quot; for her staff to pray about challenges facing the Christian Science movement and to handle animal magnetism which arose. Gill writes that Eddy got the term from the New Testament account of the garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus chastises his disciples for being unable to &quot;watch&quot; even for a short time; and that Eddy used it to refer to &quot;a particularly vigilant and active form of prayer, a set period of time when specific people would put their thoughts toward God, review questions and problems of the day, and seek spiritual understanding.&quot; Critics such as Georgine Milmine in &quot;Mclure&#x27;s&quot;, Edwin Dakin, and John Dittemore, all claimed this was evidence that Eddy had a great fear of malicious animal magnetism; although Gilbert Carpenter, one of Eddy&#x27;s staff at the time, insisted she was not fearful of it, and that she was simply being vigilant.

As time went on, Eddy tried to lessen the focus on animal magnetism within the movement, and she worked to clearly define it as unreality which only had power if one conceded to it. Though, it continued to play an important role in the teaching of Christian Science.

The belief in malicious animal magnetism remains a part of Christian Science doctrine. Christian Scientists use it as a specific term for a hypnotic belief in a power apart from God.

=== Hinduism ===

Scholars debate the influence of Hinduism on Eddy and her work. The 1930 work &quot;Hinduism Invades America&quot; argues Eddy referenced the Bhagavad-Gita in the 33rd edition of &quot;Science and Health&quot;. Gillian Gill argued that her editor, Reverend James Henry Wiggin, had introduced the references, and Eddy removed from the 1891 revision all the references to Eastern religions. Christian Scientist church member and historian Stephen Gottschalk argued that Eddy consciously distinguished Christian Science from Eastern religions starting in the mid-1880s. Damodar Singhal noted that whether or not Eddy was directly influenced by Hindu philosophy, &quot;the echoes of Vedanta in [her] literature are often striking.&quot;

===British Israelism===

Eddy was introduced to British Israelism by Julia Field-King, who herself was introduced by the writings of C. A. L. Totten. Totten alleged to have traced Queen Victoria&#x27;s genealogy to King David and Field-King offered to create a genealogy tracing Eddy to King David. Eddy eventually requested Field-King cease work on the genealogy and transferred her to London to work on expanding the church there. Since her death, academics have debated the extent of Eddy&#x27;s relationship with British Israelism with Christian Scientist historian Robert Peel arguing she was &quot;intrigued by the theory for several years,&quot; while keeping &quot;it resolutely out of her work and her writing on Christian Science.&quot; He acknowledges she uses the term &quot;Anglo-Israel&quot; in one poem, but argues the meaning is &quot;metaphorical&quot; instead of &quot;ethnic or historical.&quot;

Political Scientist Michael Barkun argued that &quot;Eddy continued to maintain an interest in British-Israelism, although she kept it out of her doctrinal writings&quot; and noted that a &quot;schismatic offshoot&quot; organized by Annie Cecelia Bill in England after Eddy&#x27;s death centered on British-Israelism. Professor of religious studies John K. Simmons, citing Peel, argued that Eddy &quot;gave the theory no real credence, at least in verifiable written form,&quot; but acknowledged British-Israelism &quot;seemed to attract the turn-of-the-century metaphysical crowd.&quot;

==Later life and death==

=== Use of medicine ===

There is controversy about how much Eddy used morphine. Biographers Ernest Sutherland Bates and Edwin Franden Dakin described Eddy as a morphine addict. Miranda Rice, a friend and close student of Eddy, told a newspaper in 1906: &quot;I know that Mrs. Eddy was addicted to morphine in the seventies.&quot; A diary kept by Calvin Frye, Eddy&#x27;s personal secretary, suggests that Eddy occasionally reverted to &quot;the old morphine habit&quot; when she was in pain. Gill writes that the prescription of morphine was normal medical practice at the time, and that &quot;I remain convinced that Mary Baker Eddy was never addicted to morphine.&quot;

Eddy recommended to her son that, rather than go against the law of the state, he should have her grandchildren vaccinated. She also paid for a mastectomy for her sister-in-law. Eddy used glasses for several years for very fine print, but later dispensed with them almost entirely, claiming she could read fine print with ease. In 1907, Arthur Brisbane interviewed Eddy. At one point he picked up a periodical, selected at random a paragraph, and asked Eddy to read it. According to Brisbane, at the age of eighty six, she read the ordinary magazine type without glasses. Towards the end of her life she was frequently attended by physicians.

=== Next Friends lawsuit ===

In 1907, the &quot;New York World&quot; sponsored a lawsuit, known as &quot;The Next Friends suit&quot;, which journalist Erwin Canham described as &quot;designed to wrest from [Eddy] and her trusted officials all control of her church and its activities.&quot; During the course of the legal case, four psychiatrists interviewed Eddy, then 86 years old, to determine whether she could manage her own affairs, and concluded that she was able to. Physician Allan McLane Hamilton told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the attacks on Eddy were the result of &quot;a spirit of religious persecution that has at last quite overreached itself&quot;, and that &quot;there seems to be a manifest injustice in taxing so excellent and capable an old lady as Mrs. Eddy with any form of insanity.&quot;

A 1907 article in the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; noted that Eddy exhibited hysterical and psychotic behavior. Psychiatrist Karl Menninger in his book &quot;The Human Mind&quot; (1927) cited Eddy&#x27;s paranoid delusions about malicious animal magnetism as an example of a &quot;schizoid personality&quot;.

Psychologists Leon Joseph Saul and Silas L. Warner, in their book &quot;The Psychotic Personality&quot; (1982), came to the conclusion that Eddy had diagnostic characteristics of Psychotic Personality Disorder (PPD). In 1983, psychologists Theodore Barber and Sheryl C. Wilson suggested that Eddy displayed traits of a fantasy prone personality.

Psychiatrist George Eman Vaillant wrote that Eddy was hypochrondriacal. Psychopharmacologist Ronald K. Siegel has written that Eddy&#x27;s lifelong secret morphine habit contributed to her development of &quot;progressive paranoia&quot;.

=== Death ===

Eddy died of pneumonia on the evening of December 3, 1910, at her home at 400 Beacon Street, in the Chestnut Hill section of Newton, Massachusetts. Her death was announced the next morning, when a city medical examiner was called in. She was buried on December 8, 1910, at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her open-air mausoleum was designed by New York architect Egerton Swartwout (1870–1943).

=== Legacy ===
A bronze memorial relief of Eddy by Lynn sculptor Reno Pisano was unveiled in December 2000, at the corner of Market Street and Oxford Street in Lynn, Massachusetts, near the site of her fall in 1866.

In 1995, Eddy was elected to the National Women’s Hall of Fame as the first American woman to have founded a worldwide religion.

Eddy was named one of the &quot;100 Most Significant Americans of All Time&quot; in 2014 by &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot;, and her book &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot; was ranked as one of the &quot;75 Books by Women Whose Words Have Changed the World&quot; by the Women&#x27;s National Book Association in 1992.

== Residences ==
In 1921, on the 100th anniversary of Eddy&#x27;s birth, a 100-ton (in rough) and 60–70 tons (hewn) pyramid with a footprint was dedicated on the site of her birthplace in Bow, New Hampshire. A gift from James F. Lord, it was dynamited in 1962 by order of the church&#x27;s board of directors. Also demolished was Eddy&#x27;s former home in Pleasant View, as the Board feared that it was becoming a place of pilgrimage. Eddy is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 105) along New Hampshire Route 9 in Concord, New Hampshire.

Several of Eddy&#x27;s homes are owned and maintained as historic sites by the Longyear Museum and may be visited (the list below is arranged by date of her occupancy):

* 1855–1860 – Hall&#x27;s Brook Road, North Groton, New Hampshire
* 1860–1862 – Stinson Lake Road, Rumney, New Hampshire
* 1865–1866 – 23 Paradise Road, Swampscott, Massachusetts
* 1868,1870 – 277 Main Street, Amesbury, Massachusetts
* 1868–1870 – 133 Central Street, Stoughton, Massachusetts
* 1875–1882 – 8 Broad Street, Lynn, Massachusetts (NRHP-listed in 2021)

<text>Gregory Palamas (; ; – 1357/1359) was a Byzantine Greek theologian and Eastern Orthodox cleric of the late Byzantine period. A monk of Mount Athos (modern Greece) and later archbishop of Thessalonica, he is famous for his defense of hesychast spirituality, the uncreated character of the light of the Transfiguration, and the distinction between God&#x27;s essence and energies (i.e., the divine will, divine grace, etc.). His teaching unfolded over the course of three major controversies, (1) with the Italo-Greek Barlaam between 1336 and 1341, (2) with the monk Gregory Akindynos between 1341 and 1347, and (3) with the philosopher Gregoras, from 1348 to 1355. His theological contributions are sometimes referred to as Palamism, and his followers as Palamites.

Gregory has been venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church since 1368. Within the Catholic Church, he has also been called a saint; Pope John Paul II repeatedly called Gregory a great theological writer. Since 1971, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church has venerated Gregory as a saint. Some of his writings are collected in the &quot;Philokalia&quot;, and since the Ottoman period, the second Sunday of Great Lent is dedicated to the memory of Gregory Palamas in most branches of the Eastern Orthodoxy, while in some, and in Eastern Catholic Churches, the issue is disputed.

== Early life ==
Gregory was born in Constantinople around the year 1296. His father, Constantine, was a courtier of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282–1328), but died when Gregory was still young. The Emperor himself took part in the raising and education of the fatherless boy and hoped that the gifted Gregory would devote himself to government service, but Palamas chose monastic life on Mt. Athos. Gregory&#x27;s mother (Kalloni) and siblings (Theodosios, Makarios, Epicharis, and Theodoti) would also embrace monasticism, and the entire family was canonized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 2009.

Before leaving for Mt. Athos, Gregory received a broad education at the University of Constantinople, including the study of Aristotle, which he would display before Theodore Metochites and the Emperor.

==Monastic life==
Despite the Emperor&#x27;s ambitions for him, Gregory, then barely 21 years old, withdrew to Mount Athos in the year 1316 and became a novice there in the Vatopedi monastery under the guidance of the monastic Elder St Nicodemos of Vatopedi. Eventually, he was tonsured a monk, and continued his life of asceticism. After the demise of the Elder Nicodemus, Gregory spent eight years of spiritual struggle under the guidance of a new Elder, Nicephorus. After this last Elder&#x27;s repose, Gregory transferred to the Great Lavra of St. Athanasius the Athonite on Mount Athos, where he served the brethren in the trapeza (refectory) and in church as a cantor. Wishing to devote himself more fully to prayer and asceticism he entered a skete called &quot;Glossia&quot;, where he taught the ancient practice of mental prayer known as &quot;prayer of the heart&quot; or hesychasm.

In 1326, because of the threat of Turkish invasions, he and the brethren retreated to the defended city of Thessaloniki, where he was then ordained a priest. Dividing his time between his ministry to the people and his pursuit of spiritual perfection, he founded a small community of hermits near Thessaloniki in a place called Veria.

He served for a short time as Abbot of the Esphigmenou Monastery but was forced to resign in 1335 due to discontentment regarding the austerity of his monastic administration.

== Hesychast controversy ==

Hesychasm attracted the attention of Barlaam, a man who either converted to Orthodoxy or was baptized Orthodox who encountered Hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices during a visit to Mount Athos; he had also read the writings of Palamas, himself an Athonite monk. Trained in Western Scholastic theology, Barlaam was scandalized by hesychasm and began to combat it both orally and in his writings. As a private teacher of theology in the Western Scholastic mode, Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the hesychasts taught.

On the hesychast side, the controversy was taken up by Palamas who was asked by his fellow monks on Mt Athos to defend hesychasm from the attacks of Barlaam. Palamas was well-educated in Greek philosophy. Gregory wrote a number of works in its defense and defended hesychasm at six different synods in Constantinople ultimately triumphing over its attackers in the synod of 1351.

===Early conflict between Barlaam and Palamas===
Although Barlaam came from southern Italy, his ancestry was Greek and he claimed Eastern Orthodoxy as his Christian faith. Arriving in Constantinople around 1330, Barlaam was working on commentaries on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite under the patronage of John VI Kantakouzenos. Around 1336, Gregory received copies of treatises written by Barlaam against the Latins, condemning their insertion of the Filioque into the Nicene Creed. Although this condemnation was solid Orthodox theology, Palamas took issue with Barlaam&#x27;s argument in support of it, namely that efforts at demonstrating the nature of God (specifically, the nature of the Holy Spirit) should be abandoned, because God is ultimately unknowable and undemonstrable to humans. Thus, Barlaam asserted that it was impossible to determine from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds. According to Sara J. Denning-Bolle, Palamas viewed Barlaam&#x27;s argument as &quot;dangerously agnostic&quot;. In his response titled &quot;Apodictic Treatises&quot;, Palamas insisted that it was indeed demonstrable that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father but not from the Son. A series of letters ensued between the two but they were unable to resolve their differences amicably.

===Triads===
In response to Barlaam&#x27;s attacks, Palamas wrote nine treatises entitled &quot;Triads For The Defense of Those Who Practice Sacred Quietude&quot;. The treatises are called &quot;triads&quot; because they were organized as three sets of three treatises.

The Triads were written in three stages. The first triad was written in the second half of the 1330s and are based on personal discussions between Palamas and Barlaam although Barlaam is never mentioned by name.

Gregory&#x27;s teaching was affirmed by the superiors and principal monks of Mt. Athos, who met in synod during 1340–1. In early 1341, the monastic communities of Mount Athos wrote the Hagioritic Tome under the supervision and inspiration of Palamas. Although the tome does not mention Barlaam by name, the work clearly takes aim at Barlaam&#x27;s views. The tome provides a systematic presentation of Palamas&#x27; teaching and became the fundamental textbook for Byzantine mysticism.

In response, Barlaam drafted &quot;Against the Messalians&quot;, which attacked Gregory by name for the first time.
Barlaam derisively called the hesychasts &quot;omphalopsychoi&quot; (men with their souls in their navels) and accused them of the heresy of Messalianism, also known as Bogomilism in the East. According to Meyendorff, Barlaam viewed &quot;any claim of real and conscious experience of God as Messalianism&quot;.

Barlaam also took exception to the doctrine held by the hesychasts as to the uncreated nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of hesychast practice, regarding it as heretical and blasphemous. It was maintained by the hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to the light which had been manifested to Jesus&#x27; disciples on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration. Barlaam viewed this doctrine of &quot;uncreated light&quot; to be polytheistic because as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God. Barlaam accuses the use of the Jesus Prayer as being a practice of Bogomilism.

The second triad quotes some of Barlaam&#x27;s writings directly. In response to this second triad, Barlaam composed the treatise &quot;Against the Messalians&quot; linking the hesychasts to the Messalians and thereby accusing them of heresy.

In the third Triad, Palamas refuted Barlaam&#x27;s charge of Messalianism by demonstrating that the hesychasts did not share the antisacramentalism of the Messalians nor did they claim to physically see the essence of God with their eyes. According to Fr. John Meyendorff &quot;Gregory Palamas orients his entire polemic against Barlaam the Calabrian on the issue of the Hellenic wisdom which he considers to be the main source of Barlaam&#x27;s errors.&quot;

===Role in the Byzantine civil war===
Although the civil war between the supporters of John VI Kantakouzenos and the regents for John V Palaeologus was not primarily a religious conflict, the theological dispute between the supporters and opponents of Palamas did play a role in the conflict. Steven Runciman points out that &quot;while the theological dispute embittered the conflict, the religious and political parties did not coincide.&quot;
The aristocrats supported Palamas largely due to their conservative and anti-Western tendencies as well as their links to the staunchly Orthodox monasteries. Although several significant exceptions leave the issue open to question, in the popular mind (and traditional historiography), the supporters of &quot;Palamism&quot; and of &quot;Kantakouzenism&quot; are usually equated. Thus, the eventual triumph of Kantakouzenos in 1347 also brought with it the conclusive triumph of the Palamists over the anti-Palamists.

===Fifth Council of Constantinople===
It became clear that the dispute between Barlaam and Palamas was irreconcilable and would require the judgment of an episcopal council. A series of six patriarchal councils were held in Constantinople on 10 June 1341, August 1341, 4 November 1344, 1 February 1347, 8 February 1347, and 28 May 1351 to consider the issues. Collectively, these councils are accepted as having ecumenical status by Orthodox Christians, some of whom call them the Fifth Council of Constantinople and the Ninth Ecumenical Council.

The dispute over hesychasm came before a synod held at Constantinople in May 1341 and presided over by the Emperor Andronicus III. The assembly, influenced by the veneration in which the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius were held in the Eastern Church, condemned Barlaam, who recanted. The ecumenical patriarch insisted that all of Barlaam&#x27;s writings be destroyed and thus no complete copies of Barlaam&#x27;s treatise &quot;Against Messalianism&quot; have survived.

Barlaam&#x27;s primary supporter Emperor Andronicus III died just five days after the synod ended. Although Barlaam initially hoped for a second chance to present his case against Palamas, he soon realised the futility of pursuing his cause, and left for Calabria where he converted to the Roman Church and was appointed Bishop of Gerace.

After Barlaam&#x27;s departure, Gregory Akindynos became the chief critic of Palamas. A second council held in Constantinople in August 1341 condemned Akindynos and affirmed the findings of the earlier council. Akindynos and his supporters gained a brief victory at a council held in 1344 which excommunicated Palamas. 
However, the last of these councils, held in May 1351, conclusively exonerated Palamas and condemned his opponents. This synod ordered that the Metropolitans of Ephesus and Ganos be defrocked and jailed. All those who were unwilling to submit to the orthodox view were to be excommunicated and kept under surveillance at their residences. A series of anathemas were pronounced against Barlaam, Akindynos and their followers; at the same time, a series of acclamations were also declared in favor of Gregory Palamas and the adherents of his doctrine. One notable opponent of Palamism was Nicephorus Gregoras who refused to submit to the dictates of the synod and was effectively imprisoned in a monastery for two years.

===Gradual acceptance of the Palamist doctrine===
Kallistos I and the ecumenical patriarchs who succeeded him mounted a vigorous campaign to have the Palamist doctrines accepted by the other Eastern patriarchates as well as all the metropolitan sees under their jurisdiction. However, it took some time to overcome initial resistance to his teachings. For example, the Metropolitan of Kiev, upon receiving tomes from Kallistos that expounded the Palamist doctrine, rejected it vehemently and composed a reply in refutation. Similarly, the Patriarchate of Antioch remained steadfastly opposed to what they viewed as an innovation; however, by the end of the fourteenth century, Palamism had become accepted there. Similar acts of resistance were seen in the metropolitan sees that were governed by the Latins as well as in some autonomous ecclesiastical regions, such as the Church of Cyprus.

One notable example of the campaign to enforce the orthodoxy of the Palamist doctrine was the action taken by Patriarch Philotheos I to crack down on Prochoros Kydones, a monk and priest at Mount Athos who was opposed to the Palamites. Kydones had written a number of anti-Palamist treatises and continued to argue forcefully against Palamism even when brought before the patriarch and enjoined to adhere to the orthodox doctrine. Finally, in exasperation, Philotheos convened a synod against Kydones in April 1368. However, even this extreme measure failed to effect the submission of Kydones and in the end, he was excommunicated and suspended from the clergy in perpetuity. The long tome that was prepared for the synod concludes with a decree canonizing Palamas who had died in 1357/59.

Despite the initial opposition of some patriarchates and sees, over time the resistance dwindled away and ultimately Palamist doctrine became accepted throughout the Eastern Orthodox Church. During this period, it became the norm for ecumenical patriarchs to profess the Palamite doctrine upon taking possession of their see.

Martin Jugie states that the opposition of the Latins and the Latinophrones, who were necessarily hostile to the doctrine, actually contributed to its adoption, and soon Latinism and Antipalamism became equivalent in the minds of many Orthodox Christians.

According to Aristeides Papadakis, &quot;all Orthodox scholars who have written on Palamas — Lossky, Krivosheine, Papamichael, Meyendorff, Christou — assume his voice to be a legitimate expression of Orthodox tradition.&quot;

== Later years ==

Palamas&#x27;s opponents in the hesychast controversy spread slanderous accusations against him, and in 1344 Patriarch John XIV imprisoned him for four years. However, in 1347 when Patriarch Isidore came to the Ecumenical Throne, Gregory was released from prison and consecrated as the Metropolitan of Thessalonica. However, since the conflict with Barlaam had not been settled at that point, the people of Thessalonica did not accept him, and he was forced to live in a number of places. It was not until 1350 that he was able to occupy the episcopal chair.
In 1354, during a voyage to Constantinople, the ship he was in fell into the hands of Turkish pirates; he was imprisoned and beaten. He was obliged to spend a year in detention at the Ottoman court where he was well treated. Eventually his ransom was paid and he returned to Thessaloniki, where he served as archbishop for the last three years of his life.

==Death and canonization==
Palamas died in 1357 or 1359. His dying words were, &quot;To the heights! To the heights!&quot; He was canonized a saint of the Eastern Orthodox Church in 1368 by Patriarch Philotheos of Constantinople, who also wrote his &quot;Vita&quot; and composed the service which is chanted in his honour. His feast day is celebrated twice a year, on 14 November, the anniversary of his death, and on the Second Sunday of Great Lent, because Gregory&#x27;s victory over Barlaam is seen as a continuation of the Triumph of Orthodoxy, i.e., the victory of the Church over heresy, celebrated the previous Sunday.

Gregory&#x27;s relics rest in the Church of Saint Gregory Palamas in Thessaloniki.

== Veneration in Eastern Slavic uses of Byzantine rite ==
The first printed Church Slavonic editions of the Triodion did not include the Sunday of Gregory Palamas until liturgical reforms of Petro Mohyla who, inter alia, aimed to update Kievan use of the Byzantine rite to then-contemporary version of its Greek counterpart. Mohyla&#x27;s reforms inspired subsequent Nikon&#x27;s reforms that brought liturgical veneration of Gregory Palamas to Moscow.

But the liturgical uses of communities that did not accept these reforms or were not affected by them, namely Old Believers and Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, did not traditionally have this celebration.

A special case is Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, who was not affected by any of these reforms initially. But her main printing center in Kyiv was affected by Peter the First&#x27;s censorship laws banning the use of any church books not conforming to Nikonian editions. At the Synod of Zamość it was agreed to obey this policy, but out of the new celebrations included in those books, only the office of Gregory Palamas was to be left out. Since then, the question of rehabilitation of Gregory Palamas in the UGCC is sometimes raised. The ban of his veneration has never been lifted, and the official UGCC calendar does not include his name.

<text>Christian Science is a set of beliefs and practices which are associated with members of the Church of Christ, Scientist. Adherents are commonly known as Christian Scientists or students of Christian Science, and the church is sometimes informally known as the Christian Science church. It was founded in 1879 in New England by Mary Baker Eddy, who wrote the 1875 book &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot;, which outlined the theology of Christian Science. The book was originally called &quot;Science and Health&quot;; the subtitle &quot;with a Key to the Scriptures&quot; was added in 1883 and later amended to &quot;with Key to the Scriptures&quot;.

The book became Christian Science&#x27;s central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.

Eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1879 to found the &quot;Church of Christ (Scientist)&quot;; the church would be reorganized under the name &quot;Church of Christ, Scientist&quot; in 1892. &quot;The Mother Church&quot;, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, was built in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1894. Known as the &quot;thinker&#x27;s religion,&quot; Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States, with nearly 270,000 members by 1936 — a figure which had declined to just over 100,000 by 1990 and reportedly to under 50,000 by 2009. The church is known for its newspaper, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002, and for its public Reading Rooms around the world.

Christian Science&#x27;s religious tenets differ considerably from many other Christian denominations, including key concepts such as the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, atonement, the resurrection, and the Eucharist. Eddy, for her part, described Christian Science as a return to &quot;primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing&quot;. Adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism, believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion. This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder, and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health.

The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, physicians for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. The reliance on prayer and avoidance of medical treatment has been blamed for the deaths of several adherents and their children. Between the 1880s and 1990s, parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.

== Overview ==
=== Metaphysical family ===

Several periods of Protestant Christian revival nurtured a proliferation of new religious movements in the United States. In the latter half of the 19th century these included what came to be known as the metaphysical family: groups such as Christian Science, Divine Science, the Unity School of Christianity, and (later) the United Church of Religious Science. From the 1890s the liberal section of the movement became known as New Thought, in part to distinguish it from the more authoritarian Christian Science.

The term &quot;metaphysical&quot; referred to the movement&#x27;s philosophical idealism, a belief in the primacy of the mental world. Adherents believed that material phenomena were the result of mental states, a view expressed as &quot;life is consciousness&quot; and &quot;God is mind.&quot; The supreme cause was referred to as Divine Mind, Truth, God, Love, Life, Spirit, Principle or Father–Mother, reflecting elements of Plato, Hinduism, Berkeley, Hegel, Swedenborg, and transcendentalism.

The metaphysical groups became known as the mind-cure movement because of their strong focus on healing. Medical practice was in its infancy, and patients regularly fared better without it. This provided fertile soil for the mind-cure groups, who argued that sickness was an absence of &quot;right thinking&quot; or failure to connect to Divine Mind. The movement traced its roots in the United States to Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802–1866), a New England clockmaker turned mental healer. His advertising flyer, &quot;To the Sick&quot; included this explanation of his clairvoyant methodology: &quot;he gives no medicines and makes no outward applications, but simply sits down by the patients, tells them their feelings and what they think is their disease. If the patients admit that he tells them their feelings, &amp;c., then his explanation is the cure; and, if he succeeds in correcting their error, he changes the fluids of the system and establishes the truth, or health. The Truth is the Cure. This mode of practise applies to all cases. If no explanation is given, no charge is made, for no effect is produced.&quot; Mary Baker Eddy had been a patient of his (1862–1865), leading to debate about how much of Christian Science was based on his ideas.

New Thought and Christian Science differed in that Eddy saw her views as a unique and final revelation. Eddy&#x27;s idea of malicious animal magnetism (that people can be harmed by the bad thoughts of others) marked another distinction, introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or &quot;materia medica&quot;, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.

=== Christian Science theology ===
Christian Science leaders place their religion within mainstream Christian teaching, according to J. Gordon Melton, and reject any identification with the New Thought movement. Eddy was strongly influenced by her Congregationalist upbringing. According to the church&#x27;s tenets, adherents accept &quot;the inspired Word of the Bible as [their] sufficient guide to eternal Life ... acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God ... [and] acknowledge His Son, one Christ; the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God&#x27;s image and likeness.&quot; When founding the Church of Christ, Scientist, in April 1879, Eddy wrote that she wanted to &quot;reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing&quot;. Later she suggested that Christian Science was a kind of second coming and that &quot;Science and Health&quot; was an inspired text. In 1895, in the &quot;Manual of the Mother Church&quot;, she ordained the Bible and &quot;Science and Health&quot; as &quot;Pastor over the Mother Church&quot;.

Christian Science theology differs in several respects from that of traditional Christianity. Eddy&#x27;s &quot;Science and Health&quot; reinterprets key Christian concepts, including the Trinity, divinity of Jesus, atonement, and resurrection; beginning with the 1883 edition, she added &quot;with a Key to the Scriptures&quot; to the title and included a glossary that redefined the Christian vocabulary. At the core of Eddy&#x27;s theology is the view that the spiritual world is the only reality and is entirely good, and that the material world, with its evil, sickness and death, is an illusion. Eddy saw humanity as an &quot;idea of Mind&quot; that is &quot;perfect, eternal, unlimited, and reflects the divine&quot;, according to Bryan Wilson; what she called &quot;mortal man&quot; is simply humanity&#x27;s distorted view of itself. Despite her view of the non-existence of evil, an important element of Christian Science theology is that evil thought, in the form of malicious animal magnetism, can cause harm, even if the harm is only apparent.
Eddy viewed God not as a person but as &quot;All-in-all&quot;. Although she often described God in the language of personhood—she used the term &quot;Father–Mother God&quot; (as did Ann Lee, the founder of Shakerism), and in the third edition of &quot;Science and Health&quot; she referred to God as &quot;she&quot;—God is mostly represented in Christian Science by the synonyms &quot;Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, Love&quot;. The Holy Ghost is Christian Science, and heaven and hell are states of mind. There is no supplication in Christian Science prayer. The process involves the Scientist engaging in a silent argument to affirm to herself the unreality of matter, something Christian Science practitioners will do for a fee, including &quot;in absentia&quot;, to address ill health or other problems. Wilson writes that Christian Science healing is &quot;not curative ... on its own premises, but rather preventative of ill health, accident and misfortune, since it claims to lead to a state of consciousness where these things do not exist. What heals is the realization that there is nothing really to heal.&quot; It is a closed system of thought, viewed as infallible if performed correctly; healing confirms the power of Truth, but its absence derives from the failure, specifically the bad thoughts, of individuals.

Eddy accepted as true the creation narrative in the Book of Genesis up to chapter 2, verse 6—that God created man in his image and likeness—but she rejected the rest &quot;as the story of the false and the material&quot;, according to Wilson. Her theology is nontrinitarian: she viewed the Trinity as suggestive of polytheism. She saw Jesus as a Christian Scientist, a &quot;Way-shower&quot; between humanity and God, and she distinguished between Jesus the man and the concept of Christ, the latter a synonym for Truth and Jesus the first person fully to manifest it. The crucifixion was not a divine sacrifice for the sins of humanity, the atonement (the forgiveness of sin through Jesus&#x27;s suffering) &quot;not the bribing of God by offerings&quot;, writes Wilson, but an &quot;at-one-ment&quot; with God. Her views on life after death were vague and, according to Wilson, &quot;there is no doctrine of the soul&quot; in Christian Science: &quot;[A]fter death, the individual continues his probationary state until he has worked out his own salvation by proving the truths of Christian Science.&quot; Eddy did not believe that the dead and living could communicate.

To the more conservative of the Protestant clergy, Eddy&#x27;s view of &quot;Science and Health&quot; as divinely inspired was a challenge to the Bible&#x27;s authority. &quot;Eddyism&quot; was viewed as a cult; one of the first uses of the modern sense of the word was in A. H. Barrington&#x27;s &quot;Anti-Christian Cults&quot; (1898), a book about Spiritualism, Theosophy and Christian Science. In a few cases Christian Scientists were expelled from Christian congregations, but ministers also worried that their parishioners were choosing to leave. In May 1885 the London &quot;Times&quot;″ Boston correspondent wrote about the &quot;Boston mind-cure craze&quot;: &quot;Scores of the most valued Church members are joining the Christian Scientist branch of the metaphysical organization, and it has thus far been impossible to check the defection.&quot; In 1907 Mark Twain described the appeal of the new religion to its adherents:

==History==
=== Mary Baker Eddy and the early Christian Science movement ===

Mary Baker Eddy was born Mary Morse Baker on a farm in Bow, New Hampshire, the youngest of six children in a religious family of Protestant Congregationalists. In common with most women at the time, Eddy was given little formal education, but read widely at home and was privately tutored. From childhood she lived with protracted ill health. Eddy&#x27;s first husband died six months after their marriage and three months before their son was born, leaving her penniless; and as a result of her poor health she lost custody of the boy when he was four. She married again, and her new husband promised to become the child&#x27;s legal guardian, but after their marriage he refused to sign the needed papers and the boy was taken to Minnesota and told his mother had died. Eddy, then known as Mary Patterson, and her husband moved to rural New Hampshire, where Eddy continued to suffer from health problems which often kept her bedridden. Eddy tried various cures for her health problems, including conventional medicine as well as most forms of alternative medicine such as Grahamism, electrotherapy, homeopathy, hydropathy, and finally mesmerism under Phineas Quimby. She was later accused by critics, beginning with Julius Dresser, of borrowing ideas from Quimby in what biographer Gillian Gill would call the &quot;single most controversial issue&quot; of her life.

In February 1866, Eddy fell on the ice in Lynn, Massachusetts. Evidence suggests she had severe injuries, but a few days later she apparently asked for her Bible, opened it to an account of one of Jesus&#x27; miracles, and left her bed telling her friends that she was healed through prayer alone. The moment has since been controversial, but she considered this moment one of the &quot;falling apples&quot; that helped her to understand Christian Science, although she said she did not fully understand it at the time.

In 1866, after her fall on the ice, Eddy began teaching her first student and began writing her ideas which she eventually published in &quot;Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures&quot;, considered her most important work. Her students voted to form a church called the Church of Christ (Scientist) in 1879, later reorganized as The First Church of Christ, Scientist, also known as The Mother Church, in 1892. She founded the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in 1881 to continue teaching students, Eddy started a number of periodicals: &quot;The Christian Science Journal&quot; in 1883, the &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot; in 1898, &quot;The Herald of Christian Science&quot; in 1903, and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; in 1908, the latter being a secular newspaper. The &quot;Monitor&quot; has gone on to win seven Pulitzer prizes as of 2011. She also wrote numerous books and articles in addition to &quot;Science and Health&quot;, including the Manual of The Mother Church which contained by-laws for church government and member activity, and founded the Christian Science Publishing Society in 1898 in order to distribute Christian Science literature. Although the movement started in Boston, the first purpose-built Christian Science church building was erected in 1886 in Oconto, Wisconsin. During Eddy&#x27;s lifetime, Christian Science spread throughout the United States and to other parts of the world including Canada, Great Britain, Germany, South Africa, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Australia, and elsewhere.

Eddy encountered significant opposition after she began teaching and writing on Christian Science, which only increased towards the end of her life. One of the most prominent examples was Mark Twain, who wrote a number of articles on Eddy and Christian Science which were first published in &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine in 1899 and were later published as a book. Another extended criticism, which again was first serialized in a magazine and then published in book form, was Georgine Milmine and Willa Cather&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science&quot; which first appeared in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; magazine in January 1907. Also in 1907, several of Eddy&#x27;s relatives filed an unsuccessful lawsuit instigated by the &quot;New York World&quot;, known in the press as the &quot;Next Friends Suit&quot;, against members of Eddy&#x27;s household, alleging that she was mentally unable to manage her own affairs. The suit fell apart after Eddy was interviewed in her home in August 1907 by the judge and two court appointed masters (one a psychiatrist) who concluded that she was mentally competent. Separately she was seen by two psychiatrists, including Allan McLane Hamilton, who came to the same conclusion. The &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;New York World&quot; stories are considered to at least partially be the reason Eddy asked the church in July 1908 to found the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; as a platform for responsible journalism.

Eddy died two years later, on the evening of Saturday, December 3, 1910, aged 89. The Mother Church announced at the end of the Sunday morning service that Eddy had &quot;passed from our sight&quot;. The church stated that &quot;the time will come when there will be no more death,&quot; but that Christian Scientists &quot;do not look for [Eddy&#x27;s] return in this world.&quot; Her estate was valued at $1.5 million, most of which she left to the church.

=== The Christian Science movement after 1910 ===

In the aftermath of Eddy&#x27;s death some newspapers speculated that the church would fall apart, while others expected it to continue just as it had before. As it was, the movement continued to grow in the first few decades after 1910. The Manual of the Mother Church prohibits the church from publishing membership figures, and it is not clear exactly when the height of the movement was. A 1936 census counted c. 268,915 Christian Scientists in the United States (2,098 per million), and Rodney Stark believes this to be close to the height. However the number of Christian Science churches continued to increase until around 1960, at which point there was a reversal and since then many churches have closed their doors. The number of Christian Science practitioners in the United States began to decline in the 1940s according to Stark. According to J. Gordon Melton, in 1972 there were 3,237 congregations worldwide, of which roughly 2,400 were in the United States; and in the following ten years about 200 congregations were closed.

During the years after Eddy&#x27;s death, the church has gone through a number of hardships and controversies. This included attempts to make practicing Christian Science illegal in the United States and elsewhere; a period known as the Great Litigation which involved two intertwined lawsuits regarding church governance; persecution under the Nazi and Communist regimes in Germany and the Imperial regime in Japan; a series of lawsuits involving the deaths of members of the church, most notably some children; and a controversial decision to publish a book by Bliss Knapp. In conjunction with the Knapp book controversy, there was controversy within the church involving &quot;The Monitor Channel&quot;, part of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; which had been losing money, and which eventually led to the channel shutting down. Acknowledging their earlier mistake, of accepting a multi-million dollar publishing incentive to offset broadcasting losses, The Christian Science Board Of Directors, with the concurrence of the Trustees Of The Christian Science Publishing Society, withdrew Destiny Of The Mother Church from publication in September 2023. In addition, it has since its beginning been branded as a cult by more fundamentalist strains of Christianity, and attracted significant opposition as a result. A number of independent teachers and alternative movements of Christian Science have emerged since its founding, but none of these individuals or groups have achieved the prominence of the Christian Science church.

Despite the hardships and controversies, many Christian Science churches and Reading Rooms remain in existence around the world, and in recent years there have been reports of the religion growing in Africa, though it remains significantly behind other evangelical groups. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; also remains a well respected non-religious paper which is especially noted for its international reporting and lack of partisanship.

== Healing practices ==
=== Christian Science prayer ===


Christian Scientists avoid almost all medical treatment, relying instead on Christian Science prayer. This consists of silently arguing with oneself; there are no appeals to a personal god, and no set words. Caroline Fraser wrote in 1999 that the practitioner might repeat: &quot;the allness of God using Eddy&#x27;s seven synonyms—Life, Truth, Love, Spirit, Soul, Principle and Mind,&quot; then that &quot;Spirit, Substance, is the only Mind, and man is its image and likeness; that Mind is intelligence; that Spirit is substance; that Love is wholeness; that Life, Truth, and Love are the only reality.&quot; She might deny other religions, the existence of evil, mesmerism, astrology, numerology, and the symptoms of whatever the illness is. She concludes, Fraser writes, by asserting that disease is a lie, that this is the word of God, and that it has the power to heal.

Christian Science practitioners are certified by the Church of Christ, Scientist, to charge a fee for Christian Science prayer. There were 1,249 practitioners worldwide in 2015; in the United States in 2010 they charged $25–$50 for an e-mail, telephone or face-to-face consultation. Their training is a two-week, 12-lesson course called &quot;primary class&quot;, based on the Recapitulation chapter of &quot;Science and Health&quot;. Practitioners wanting to teach primary class take a six-day &quot;normal class&quot;, held in Boston once every three years, and become Christian Science teachers. There are also Christian Science nursing homes. They offer no medical services; the nurses are Christian Scientists who have completed a course of religious study and training in basic skills, such as feeding and bathing.

The &quot;Christian Science Journal&quot; and &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot; publish anecdotal healing testimonials (they published 53,900 between 1900 and April 1989), which must be accompanied by statements from three verifiers: &quot;people who know [the testifier] well and have either witnessed the healing or can vouch for [the testifier&#x27;s] integrity in sharing it&quot;. Philosopher Margaret P. Battin wrote in 1999 that the seriousness with which these testimonials are treated by Christian Scientists ignores factors such as false positives caused by self-limiting conditions. Because no negative accounts are published, the testimonials strengthen people&#x27;s tendency to rely on anecdotes. A church study published in 1989 examined 10,000 published testimonials, 2,337 of which the church said involved conditions that had been medically diagnosed, and 623 of which were &quot;medically confirmed by follow-up examinations&quot;. The report offered no evidence of the medical follow-up. The Massachusetts Committee for Children and Youth listed among the report&#x27;s flaws that it had failed to compare the rates of successful and unsuccessful Christian Science treatment.

Nathan Talbot, a church spokesperson, told the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; in 1983 that church members were free to choose medical care, but according to former Christian Scientists those who do may be ostracized. In 2010 the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported church leaders as saying that, for over a year, they had been &quot;encouraging members to see a physician if they feel it is necessary&quot;, and that they were repositioning Christian Science prayer as a supplement to medical care, rather than a substitute. The church has lobbied to have the work of Christian Science practitioners covered by insurance.

As of 2015, it was reported that Christian Scientists in Australia were not advising anyone against vaccines, and the religious exception was deemed &quot;no longer current or necessary&quot;. In 2021, a church Committee on Publication reiterated that although vaccination was an individual choice, that the church did not dictate against it, and those who were not vaccinated did not do so because of any &quot;church dogma&quot;.

== Church of Christ, Scientist ==
=== Governance ===

In the hierarchy of the Church of Christ, Scientist, only the Mother Church in Boston, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, uses the definite article in its name. Otherwise the first Christian Science church in any city is called First Church of Christ, Scientist, then Second Church of Christ, Scientist, and so on, followed by the name of the city (for example, Third Church of Christ, Scientist, London). When a church closes, the others in that city are not renamed.

Founded in April 1879, the Church of Christ, Scientist is led by a president and five-person board of directors. There is a public-relations department, known as the Committee on Publication, with representatives around the world; this was set up by Eddy in 1898 to protect her own and the church&#x27;s reputation. The church was accused in the 1990s of silencing internal criticism by firing staff, delisting practitioners and excommunicating members.

The church&#x27;s administration is headquartered on Christian Science Center on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Huntington Avenue, located on several acres in the Back Bay section of Boston. The 14.5-acre site includes the Mother Church (1894), Mother Church Extension (1906), the Christian Science Publishing Society building (1934)—which houses the Mary Baker Eddy Library and the church&#x27;s administrative staff—the Sunday School building (1971), and the Church Colonnade building (1972). It also includes the 26-story Administration Building (1972), designed by Araldo Cossutta of I. M. Pei &amp; Associates, which until 2008 housed the administrative staff from the church&#x27;s 15 departments. There is also a children&#x27;s fountain and a reflecting pool.

=== &quot;Manual of The Mother Church&quot; ===
Eddy&#x27;s &quot;Manual of The Mother Church&quot; (first published 1895) lists the church&#x27;s by-laws. Requirements for members include daily prayer and daily study of the Bible and &quot;Science and Health&quot;. Members must subscribe to church periodicals if they can afford to, and pay an annual tax to the church of not less than one dollar.

Prohibitions include engaging in mental malpractice; visiting a store that sells &quot;obnoxious&quot; books; joining other churches; publishing articles that are uncharitable toward religion, medicine, the courts or the law; and publishing the number of church members. The manual also prohibits engaging in public debate about Christian Science without board approval, and learning hypnotism. It includes &quot;The Golden Rule&quot;: &quot;A member of The Mother Church shall not haunt Mrs. Eddy&#x27;s drive when she goes out, continually stroll by her house, or make a summer resort near her for such a purpose.&quot;

=== Services ===

The Church of Christ, Scientist is a lay church which has no ordained clergy or rituals, and performs no baptisms; with clergy of other faiths often performing marriage or funeral services since they have no clergy of their own. Its main religious texts are the Bible and &quot;Science and Health&quot;. Each church has two Readers, who read aloud a &quot;Bible lesson&quot; or &quot;lesson sermon&quot; made up of selections from those texts during the Sunday service, and a shorter set of readings to open Wednesday evening testimony meetings. In addition to readings, members offer testimonials during the main portion of the Wednesday meetings, including recovery from ill health attributed to prayer. There are also hymns, time for silent prayer, and repeating together the Lord&#x27;s Prayer at each service.

=== Notable members ===
Notable adherents of Christian Science have included Directors of Central Intelligence William H. Webster and Admiral Stansfield M. Turner; and Richard Nixon&#x27;s chief of staff H. R. Haldeman and Chief Domestic Advisor John Ehrlichman. The viscountess Nancy Astor was a Christian Scientist, as was naval officer Charles Lightoller, who survived the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912.

Christian Science has been well represented in the film industry, including Carol Channing and Jean Stapleton; Colleen Dewhurst; Joan Crawford, Doris Day, George Hamilton, Mary Pickford, Ginger Rogers, Mickey Rooney; Horton Foote; King Vidor; Robert Duvall, and Val Kilmer. Those raised by Christian Scientists include jurist Helmuth James Graf von Moltke, military analyst Daniel Ellsberg; Ellen DeGeneres, Henry Fonda, Audrey Hepburn; James Hetfield, Marilyn Monroe, Robin Williams, and Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor&#x27;s godfather, the British politician Victor Cazalet, was also a member of the church. Actor Anne Archer was raised within Christian Science; she left the church when her son, Tommy Davis, was a child, and both became prominent in the Church of Scientology. Four prominent African American entertainers have been associated with Christian Science, influenced by Marietta T. Webb, who became one of the first African Americans listed in the Christian Science Journal as a practitioner in 1911 - Singer Pearl Bailey, Jazz Percussionist Lionel Hampton, Conductor Everett Lee, and Actor Alfre Woodard.

A conspicuous event was the death in June 1937 of actress Jean Harlow, who died of kidney failure at age 26. Her mother, known as Mama Jean, was a recent convert to Christian Science and did on at least two occasions attempt to block conventional medical treatment for her daughter. Fellow actors and studio executives intervened, and Harlow received medical treatment, although in 1937, nothing could be done for kidney failure and she perished.

Though never identifying as a Christian Scientist, Albert Einstein studied Science and Health, supported many of its conclusions, and admired Eddy. Biographer Robert Peel called Einstein&#x27;s interest in the religion &quot;slight but recurrent.&quot; There are several first-hand accounts of Einstein visiting Christian Science churches and reading rooms in New York City and New Jersey in the 1950s. In his biography of Einstein, Walter Isaacson notes that Hans Albert, Einstein&#x27;s son, became a Christian Scientist.

=== Christian Science Publishing Society ===
The Christian Science Publishing Society publishes several periodicals, including the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, winner of seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002. This had a daily circulation in 1970 of 220,000, which by 2008 had contracted to 52,000. In 2009 it moved to a largely online presence with a weekly print run. In the 1980s the church produced its own television programs, and in 1991 it founded a 24-hour news channel, which closed with heavy losses after 13 months.

The church also publishes the weekly &quot;Christian Science Sentinel&quot;, the monthly &quot;Christian Science Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Herald of Christian Science&quot;, a non-English publication. In April 2012 JSH-Online made back issues of the &quot;Journal&quot;, &quot;Sentinel&quot; and &quot;Herald&quot; available online to subscribers.

<doc id="125311" wikidata="Q204218" url="?curid=125311" title="Stuart Sutcliffe">
<text>Stuart Fergusson Victor Sutcliffe (23 June 1940 – 10 April 1962) was a British painter and musician from Edinburgh, Scotland, best known as the original bass guitarist of the Beatles. Sutcliffe left the band to pursue his career as a painter, having previously attended the Liverpool College of Art. Sutcliffe and John Lennon are credited with inventing the name &quot;Beetles&quot; (sic), as they both liked Buddy Holly&#x27;s band, the Crickets. They also had a fascination with group names with double meanings (as Crickets, for example, the word referring to both an insect and a sport), so Lennon then came up with &quot;The Beatles&quot;, from the word &quot;beat&quot; (though Lennon&#x27;s original spelling was &quot;Beatals&quot;). As a member of the group when it was a five-piece band, Sutcliffe is one of several who are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Fifth Beatle&quot;.

When he performed with the Beatles in Hamburg, he met photographer Astrid Kirchherr, to whom he was later engaged. After leaving the Beatles, he enrolled in the Hamburg College of Art, studying under future pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi, who later wrote a report stating that Sutcliffe was one of his best students. Sutcliffe earned other praise for his paintings, which mostly explored a style related to abstract expressionism.

While studying in West Germany, Sutcliffe began suffering from intense headaches and experiencing acute light sensitivity. In February 1962, he collapsed in the middle of an art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed tests, but were unable to determine a cause. After collapsing again on 10 April 1962, Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way. The cause of death was later found to have been a brain haemorrhage — severe bleeding in the right ventricle of his brain.

==Early years==
Sutcliffe was the eldest child of Martha, known as Millie, a teacher at an infants&#x27; school and Charles Sutcliffe, a senior civil servant. Charles had moved to Liverpool in 1943 to help with wartime work and subsequently signed on as a ship&#x27;s engineer, so he was often at sea during his son&#x27;s early years.

Sutcliffe had two younger sisters, Pauline and Joyce; three older half-brothers, Joe, Ian, and Charles; and an older half-sister, Mattie, from his father&#x27;s first marriage to a woman also named Martha.

Sutcliffe was born at the Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital and Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion in Edinburgh. After his family moved to England, he was brought up at 37 Aigburth Drive in Liverpool. He attended Park View Primary School, Huyton (1946–1951), and Prescot Grammar School from 4 September 1951 to 1956. When Sutcliffe&#x27;s father returned home on leave, he invited his son and art college classmate Rod Murray (also Sutcliffe&#x27;s housemate and best friend), for a &quot;real good booze-up&quot;, slipping £10 into Sutcliffe&#x27;s pocket before disappearing for another six months.

During his first year at the Liverpool College of Art, Sutcliffe worked as a bin man on the Liverpool Corporation&#x27;s waste collection trucks. Lennon was introduced to Sutcliffe by mutual friend Bill Harry when all three were students at the College of Art. According to Lennon, Sutcliffe had a &quot;marvellous art portfolio&quot; and was a very talented painter who was one of the &quot;stars&quot; of the school. He helped Lennon improve his artistic skills, and with others, worked with him when Lennon had to submit work for exams. 

Sutcliffe shared a flat with Murray at 9 Percy Street, Liverpool, before being evicted. He moved to Hillary Mansions at 3 Gambier Terrace, home of art student Margaret Chapman, who vied with Sutcliffe to be the best painter in class. The flat was opposite the new Anglican cathedral in the rundown area of Liverpool 8, with bare lightbulbs and a mattress on the floor in the corner. Lennon moved in with Sutcliffe in early 1960. (Paul McCartney later admitted he was jealous of Sutcliffe&#x27;s relationship with Lennon, as he had to take a &quot;back seat&quot; to Sutcliffe.) 

Sutcliffe and his flatmates painted the rooms yellow and black, which their landlady did not appreciate.

After talking to Sutcliffe one night at the Casbah Coffee Club (owned by Pete Best&#x27;s mother, Mona Best), Lennon and McCartney persuaded him to buy a Höfner 500/5 model bass guitar on hire-purchase from Frank Hessey&#x27;s Music Shop. Sutcliffe&#x27;s prior music experience consisted of piano lessons, which his mother had insisted on since he was nine; singing in the Huyton church choir, playing bugle in the Air Training Corps, and playing guitar using chords his father had taught him. 

In May 1960, Sutcliffe joined Lennon, McCartney, and George Harrison (then known as &quot;the Silver Beatles&quot;). Although he had previously played acoustic guitar, Sutcliffe&#x27;s fingers would often blister during long rehearsals, as he had never practised long enough for his fingers to become calloused. He started acting as a booking agent for the group, and they often used his Gambier Terrace flat as a rehearsal room.

In July 1960, the Sunday newspaper &quot;The People&quot; ran an article titled &quot;The Beatnik Horror&quot; with a photograph taken in the flat below Sutcliffe&#x27;s of a teenaged Lennon lying on the floor, with Sutcliffe standing by a window. As they had often visited the Jacaranda club, its owner, Allan Williams, had arranged for the photo to be taken, subsequently taking over from Sutcliffe to book concerts for the group: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe. The Beatles&#x27; subsequent name change came during an afternoon in the Renshaw Hall bar when Sutcliffe, Lennon, and Lennon&#x27;s girlfriend, Cynthia Powell, thought up names similar to Holly&#x27;s band, the Crickets, and came up with Beetles.

==The Beatles and Hamburg==

Sutcliffe&#x27;s playing style was elementary, mostly sticking to root notes of chords. Harry—an art school friend and founder and editor of the &quot;Mersey Beat&quot; newspaper—complained to Sutcliffe that he should be concentrating on art and not music, as he thought that Sutcliffe was a competent musician whose talents would be better used in the visual arts. While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles biographies as appearing uncomfortable onstage and occasionally playing with his back to the audience, Pete Best, their drummer at the time, denies this. Best recalled Sutcliffe was usually good-natured and &quot;animated&quot; before an audience. When the Beatles auditioned for Larry Parnes at the Wyvern Club in Liverpool, Williams later claimed Parnes would have hired the group as the backing band for Billy Fury for £10 per week (), but as Sutcliffe turned his back to Parnes throughout the audition (because, as Williams believed, Sutcliffe could not play very well), Parnes said he would hire them only if they got rid of Sutcliffe. Parnes later denied this, stating his only concern was that the group had no permanent drummer. Klaus Voormann regarded Sutcliffe as a good bass player, although Beatles&#x27; historian Richie Unterberger described Sutcliffe&#x27;s bass playing as an &quot;artless thump&quot;.

Sutcliffe&#x27;s profile grew after he began wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses and tight trousers. His high spot was singing &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, which drew more applause than the other Beatles and increased the friction with McCartney. Lennon also started to criticise Sutcliffe, joking about his size and playing. On 5 December 1960, an underage Harrison was sent back to Britain. McCartney and Best were deported for attempted arson at the Bambi Kino, which left Lennon and Sutcliffe in Hamburg. Lennon also returned home, but as Sutcliffe had a cold, he stayed in Hamburg. Sutcliffe later borrowed money from his girlfriend Astrid Kirchherr so he could fly back to Liverpool on Friday, 20 January 1961, although he returned to Hamburg in March with the other Beatles.
In July 1961, Sutcliffe decided to leave the group to continue painting. After being awarded a postgraduate scholarship, he enrolled at Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, where he studied under the tutelage of Eduardo Paolozzi. He briefly lent McCartney his bass until the latter could earn enough to buy a specially made smaller left-handed Höfner 500/1 bass of his own in June 1961. However, Sutcliffe specifically asked McCartney (who is left-handed) not to change the strings around or restring the instrument, so McCartney had to play the bass as it was.

In 1967, a photo of Sutcliffe was included on the cover of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (extreme left, in front of fellow artist Aubrey Beardsley).

==Astrid Kirchherr==

Sutcliffe met Astrid Kirchherr in the Kaiserkeller, where she had gone to watch the Beatles perform. She had been brought up by her widowed mother, Nielsa Kirchherr, on Eimsbütteler Strasse, in a wealthy part of the Hamburg suburb of Altona. After a photo session with the Beatles, Kirchherr invited them to her mother&#x27;s house for tea. She showed them her bedroom, which she had decorated in black including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch hanging from the ceiling. Sutcliffe was smitten and began dating Kirchherr shortly afterwards.

He wrote to friends that he was infatuated with her, and asked her German friends which colours, films, books and painters she liked. Best commented that the beginning of their relationship was &quot;like one of those fairy stories&quot;. Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November 1960 and exchanged rings, as is the German custom. Sutcliffe later wrote his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr. They were shocked because they thought he would give up his career as an artist, although he told Kirchherr he would like to be an art teacher in London or Germany. After moving into the Kirchherr family&#x27;s house, Sutcliffe used to borrow Astrid&#x27;s clothes. He wore her leather trousers and jackets, oversized shirts and long scarves, and collarless jackets. He borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels to wear on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.

==Art==

Sutcliffe displayed artistic talent at an early age. Fellow student Helen Anderson remembered his early works as very aggressive with dark, moody colours, which was not what she expected from such a &quot;quiet student&quot;. One of Sutcliffe&#x27;s paintings was shown at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool as part of the John Moores exhibition, from November 1959 to January 1960. After the exhibition, Moores bought Sutcliffe&#x27;s canvas for £65 (), which was then equal to 6–7 weeks&#x27; wages for an average working man. The picture Moores bought was titled &quot;Summer Painting&quot;, and Sutcliffe attended a formal dinner to celebrate the exhibition with another art student, Susan Williams. Murray remembered that the work was painted on a board rather than a canvas. Due to its size, it had to be cut in two and hinged. Murray noted only one of the pieces actually got to the exhibition (because they stopped at a pub to celebrate), but sold nonetheless because Moores bought it for his son.

Sutcliffe was turned down when he applied to study for an Art Teacher&#x27;s Diploma (ATD) course at Liverpool Art College, but after meeting Kirchherr, he decided to leave the Beatles and attend the Hamburg College of Art. In June 1961, he did so, under the tutelage of Paolozzi, who later wrote a report commending Sutcliffe. In Paolozzi&#x27;s words: &quot;Sutcliffe is very gifted and very intelligent. In the meantime he has become one of my best students.&quot;

Sutcliffe&#x27;s few surviving works reveal influence from British and European abstract artists contemporary with the Abstract Expressionist movement in the U.S. His earlier figurative work is reminiscent of the kitchen sink school, particularly of John Bratby, though Sutcliffe was producing abstract work by the end of the &#x27;50s including &quot;Summer Painting&quot; purchased by Moores. Sutcliffe&#x27;s works bear some comparison with those of John Hoyland and Nicolas de Staël, though they are more lyrical (Sutcliffe used the stage name &quot;Stu de Staël&quot; when he was playing with the Beatles on a Scottish tour in spring 1960). His later works are typically untitled, constructed from heavily impastoed slabs of pigment in the manner of de Staël (whom he learned about from Surrey-born art instructor Nicky Horsfield) and overlaid with scratched or squeezed linear elements creating enclosed spaces.

&quot;Hamburg Painting No. 2&quot; was purchased by Liverpool&#x27;s Walker Art Gallery and is one of a series entitled &quot;Hamburg&quot; in which surface and colour changes produce atmospheric energy. European artists (including Paolozzi) were also influencing Sutcliffe at the time. The Walker Art Gallery has other works by Sutcliffe: &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; (in charcoal) and &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;. Lennon later hung two of Sutcliffe&#x27;s paintings in his house (Kenwood) in Weybridge, and McCartney had a Paolozzi sculpture in his Cavendish Avenue home.

==Death==

While studying in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity to light. According to Kirchherr, some of the headaches left him temporarily blind. In February 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed during an art class in Hamburg. Kirchherr&#x27;s mother had German doctors examine him, but they were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches. They suggested he return to the UK and have himself admitted to a hospital with better facilities; however, after arriving, Sutcliffe was told nothing was wrong and returned to Hamburg. He continued living with the Kirchherrs, but his condition soon worsened. After he collapsed again on 10 April 1962, Kirchherr took him to hospital, riding with him in the ambulance, but he died before they arrived. The cause of death was a cerebral haemorrhage, specifically a ruptured aneurysm resulting in cerebral paralysis due to severe bleeding into the right ventricle of the brain. He was 21 years old.

On 13 April 1962, Kirchherr met the Beatles at Hamburg Airport, telling them Sutcliffe had died a few days earlier. Sutcliffe&#x27;s mother flew to Hamburg with Beatles manager Brian Epstein and returned to Liverpool with her son&#x27;s body. Sutcliffe&#x27;s father did not hear of Stuart&#x27;s death for three weeks, as he was sailing to South America on a cruise ship, although the family arranged for a padre, a military chaplain, to give him the news as soon as the ship docked in Buenos Aires. After Sutcliffe&#x27;s death, Kirchherr wrote a letter to his mother, apologising for being too ill to attend his funeral in Liverpool and saying how much she and Lennon missed him:

Oh, Mum, he (Lennon) is in a terrible mood now, he just can&#x27;t believe that darling Stuart never comes back. [He&#x27;s] just crying his eyes out ... John is marvellous to me, he says that he knows Stuart so much and he loves him so much that he can understand me.

The cause of Sutcliffe&#x27;s aneurysm is unknown, although authors of books on the Beatles have speculated it was caused by an earlier head injury. He may have been either kicked in the head, or thrown head first against a brick wall during an attack outside Lathom Hall after a performance in January 1961. According to booking agent Allan Williams, Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe&#x27;s aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe sustained a fractured skull in the fight and Lennon&#x27;s little finger was broken. Sutcliffe refused medical attention at the time and failed to keep an X-ray appointment at Sefton General Hospital.

Although Lennon did not attend nor send flowers to Sutcliffe&#x27;s funeral, his second wife, Yoko Ono, recalled that Lennon mentioned Sutcliffe&#x27;s name often, saying he was &quot;[My] alter ego ... a spirit in his world ... a guiding force&quot;.

Sutcliffe is buried in Huyton Parish Church Cemetery (also known as St. Michael&#x27;s) in the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley, Merseyside in North West England.

==Posthumous music releases==

The Beatles&#x27; compilation album &quot;Anthology 1&quot;, released in 1995, had previously unreleased recordings from the group&#x27;s early years. Sutcliffe plays bass with the Beatles on three songs they recorded in 1960: &quot;Hallelujah, I Love Her So&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Mine&quot;, and &quot;Cayenne&quot;. In addition, he is pictured on the front covers of all three &quot;Anthology&quot; albums.

In 2011, Sutcliffe&#x27;s estate released a recording claimed to be Sutcliffe singing a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Tender&quot;, recorded in 1961 and donated to the estate in 2009. The cover art shows a Sutcliffe painting entitled &quot;Homage to Elvis&quot;. The recording was quickly proven to be fake by amateurs and industry professionals alike; it was clearly an amateur &#x27;pitch shift&#x27; edit of the 1967 recording of &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; by The Boston Show Band (later known as the Glittermen).

==Film, television, and books==
Part One of &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; video documentary covers Sutcliffe&#x27;s time with the group. There is no mention of his death in the documentary, but it is discussed in the accompanying book.

Sutcliffe was portrayed by David Nicholas Wilkinson in &quot;Birth of the Beatles&quot; (1979) and by Lee Williams in &quot;In His Life: The John Lennon Story&quot; (2000). Sutcliffe&#x27;s role in the Beatles&#x27; early career and the factors that led him to leave the group are dramatised in the 1994 film &quot;Backbeat&quot;, in which he was portrayed by American actor Stephen Dorff. Sutcliffe does not appear in &quot;Nowhere Boy&quot; (2009), but is briefly mentioned toward the end of the film.

Four television documentaries have been broadcast that deal with Sutcliffe&#x27;s life:
*&quot;Midnight Angel&quot; (1990) Granada TV (networked) U.K.
*&quot;Exhibition&quot; (1991) Cologne, German TV
*&quot;Stuart, His Life and Art&quot; (2005) BBC TV
*&quot;Stuart Sutcliffe, The Lost Beatle&quot;

Books about Sutcliffe:

* &quot;Backbeat: Stuart Sutcliffe: The Lost Beatle&quot; (1994) Alan Clayson and Pauline Sutcliffe 
* &quot;Stuart, The Life and Art of Stuart Sutcliffe&quot; (1995) Pauline Sutcliffe and Kay Williams 
* &quot;The Beatles Shadow, Stuart Sutcliffe, &amp; His Lonely Hearts Club&quot; (2001) Pauline Sutcliffe and Douglas Thompson 
* &quot;Stuart Sutcliffe: a retrospective&quot; (2008) Matthew H. Clough and Colin Fallows

<text>Lahore ( ; ; ) is the capital and largest city of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is the second largest city in Pakistan, after Karachi, and 27th largest in the world, with a population of over 14 million. Lahore is one of Pakistan&#x27;s major industrial, educational and economic hubs. It has been the historic capital and cultural center of the wider Punjab region, and is one of Pakistan&#x27;s most socially liberal, progressive, and cosmopolitan cities.

Lahore&#x27;s origin dates back to antiquity. The city has been inhabited for around two millennia, although it rose to prominence in the late 10th century with the establishment of the Walled City, its fortified interior. Lahore served as the capital of several empires during the medieval era, including the Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavid Empire and Delhi Sultanate. It reached the height of its splendor under the Mughal Empire between the late 16th and early 18th centuries, being its capital city for many years. During this period, it was one of the largest cities in the world. The city was captured by the forces of the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah in 1739. Although the Mughal authority was re-established, it fell into a period of decay while being contested among the Afghans and the Sikhs between 1748 and 1798. Lahore eventually became the capital of the Sikh Empire in the early 19th century, regaining some of its lost grandeur. Lahore was annexed to the British Raj in 1849 and became the capital of British Punjab. Lahore was central to the independence movements of British India, with the city being the site of both the Declaration of Indian Independence and the resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan. It experienced some of the worst rioting during the Partition period preceding Pakistan&#x27;s establishment. Following the success of the Pakistan Movement and the subsequent partition of British India in 1947, Lahore was declared the capital of Pakistan&#x27;s Punjab province.

Located in central-eastern Punjab, along the River Ravi, it is the largest Punjabi-speaking city in the world. Lahore exerts a strong cultural and political influence over Pakistan. A UNESCO City of Literature and major centre for Pakistan&#x27;s publishing industry, Lahore remains the foremost center of Pakistan&#x27;s literary scene. The city is also a major centre of education, with some of Pakistan&#x27;s leading universities based in the city. Lahore is home to Pakistan&#x27;s Punjabi film industry, and is a major centre of &quot;Qawwali&quot; music. The city also hosts much of Pakistan&#x27;s tourism industry, with major attractions including the Walled City, the famous Badshahi and Wazir Khan mosques, as well as several Sikh and Sufi shrines. Lahore is also home to the Lahore Fort and Shalimar Gardens, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

== Etymology ==
The origin of Lahore&#x27;s name is unclear. The city&#x27;s name has been variously recorded by early Muslim historians as &quot;Luhawar&quot;, &quot;Lūhār&quot;, and &quot;Rahwar&quot;. The Iranian polymath and geographer, Abu Rayhan al-Biruni, referred to the city as &quot;Luhāwar&quot; in his 11th century work, &quot;Qanun&quot;, while the poet Amir Khusrow, who lived during the Delhi Sultanate period, recorded the city&#x27;s name as &quot;Lāhanūr&quot;. Yaqut al-Hamawi records the city&#x27;s name as &quot;Lawhūr&quot;, mentioning that it was famously known as &quot;Lahāwar&quot;. Persian historian Firishta mentions the city as &quot;Alahwar&quot; in his work, with &quot;al-Ahwar&quot; being another variation.

One theory suggests that Lahore&#x27;s name is a corruption of the word &quot;Ravāwar,&quot; as R to L shifts are common in languages derived from Sanskrit. &quot;Ravāwar&quot; is the simplified pronunciation of the name &quot;Iravatyāwar,&quot; a name possibly derived from the Ravi River, known as the Iravati River in the &quot;Vedas&quot;. Another theory suggests the city&#x27;s name may derive from the word &quot;Lohar&quot;, meaning &quot;blacksmith&quot;.

According to a legend, Lahore&#x27;s name derives from &quot;Lavpur&quot; or &quot;Lavapuri&quot; (City of &quot;Lava&quot;), and is said to have been founded by Prince Lava, the son of Sita and Rama. The same account attributes the founding of nearby Kasur to his twin brother Kusha, though it was actually established in the 16th century.

== History ==


=== Origins ===
No definitive record of Lahore&#x27;s early history exists, and its ambiguous historical background has given rise to various theories about its establishment and history.

Alexander the Great&#x27;s historians make no mention of any city near Lahore&#x27;s location during his invasion in 326 BCE, suggesting the city had not been founded by that point or was not noteworthy. Ptolemy mentions in his &quot;Geography&quot; a city called &quot;Labokla&quot; situated near the Chenab and Ravi rivers which may have been in reference to ancient Lahore, or an abandoned predecessor of the city. Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang gave a vivid description of a large and prosperous unnamed city that may have been Lahore when he visited the region in 630 CE during his tour of India.

The first document that mentions Lahore by name is the &quot;Hudud al-&#x27;Alam&quot; (&quot;The Regions of the World&quot;), written in 982 CE, in which Lahore is mentioned as a town which had &quot;impressive temples, large markets and huge orchards&quot;.

Lahore, previously a town, first emerged as a notable city in 11th century during the era of Sufi saint Ali al-Hajvery. Few other references to Lahore remain from before its capture by the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud in the 11th century. During this time, Lahore appears to have served as the capital of Punjab under Raja Anandapala of the Üdi Shahi empire, who moved his capital there from Waihind.

===Medieval era===
==== Ghaznavid ====
Sultan Mahmud conquered Lahore between 1020 and 1027, making it part of Ghaznavid Empire. He appointed Malik Ayaz as its governor in 1021. In 1034, the city was captured by Nialtigin, the rebellious governor of Multan. However, his forces were expelled by Malik Ayaz in 1036.

With the support of Sultan Ibrahim, Malik Ayaz rebuilt and repopulated the city, which had been devastated after the Ghaznavid invasion. He also erected city walls and a masonry fort was built in 1037–1040 on the ruins of a previous one. A confederation of Hindu princes unsuccessfully laid siege to Lahore in 1043–44 during Ayaz&#x27;s rule. The city became a cultural and academic centre, renowned for poetry.

Lahore was formally made the eastern capital of Ghaznavid Empire during the reign of Khusrau Shah in 1152. After the fall of Ghazni in 1163, It became the sole capital. Under their patronage, poets and scholars from other cities of Ghaznavid Empire congregated in Lahore. The entire city of Lahore during the medieval Ghaznavid era was probably located west of the modern Shah Alami Bazaar and north of the Bhatti Gate.

==== Mamluk ====
Following the Siege of Lahore in 1186, the Ghurid ruler Muhammad captured the city and imprisoned the last Ghaznavid ruler Khusrau Malik, thus ending Ghaznavid rule over Lahore. Lahore was made an important establishment of the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate following the assassination of Muhammad of Ghor in 1206. Under the reign of Mamluk sultan Qutb ud-Din Aibak, Lahore attracted poets and scholars from medieval Muslim World. Lahore at this time had more poets writing in Persian than any other city. Following the death of Aibak, Lahore first came under the control of the Governor of Multan, Nasir ad-Din Qabacha, and then was briefly captured in 1217 by the sultan in Delhi, Iltutmish.

In an alliance with local Khokhars in 1223, Khwarazmian sultan Jalal al-Din Mangburni captured Lahore after fleeing from Genghis Khan&#x27;s invasion of his realm. Mangburni then fled from Lahore to the city of Uch Sharif after Iltutmish&#x27;s army re-captured Lahore in 1228.

The threat of Mongol invasions and political instability in Lahore caused future sultans to regard Delhi as a safer capital for the sultanate, even though Delhi was considered a forward base whereas Lahore was widely considered as the centre of Islamic culture in northeastern Punjab.

Lahore came under progressively weaker central rule under Iltutmish&#x27;s descendants in Delhi, to the point that governors in the city acted with great autonomy. Under the rule of Kabir Khan Ayaz, Lahore was virtually independent from the Delhi Sultanate. Actual Sultanate rule on Lahore lasted only a few decades until the locals reclaimed their autonomy. Lahore was sacked and ruined by the Mongol army in 1241. Lahore governor Malik Ikhtyaruddin Qaraqash fled the Mongols, while the Mongols held the city for a few years under the rule of the Mongol chief Toghrul.

In 1266, sultan Balban reconquered Lahore, but in 1287 under the Mongol ruler Temür Khan, the Mongols again overran northern Punjab. Because of Mongol invasions, Lahore region became a city on a frontier, with the region&#x27;s administrative centre shifted south to Dipalpur. The Mongols again invaded northern Punjab in 1298, though their advance was eventually stopped by Ulugh Khan, brother of Sultan Alauddin Khalji of Delhi. The Mongols again attacked Lahore in 1305.

====Tughluq====
Lahore briefly flourished again under the reign of Ghiyath al-Din Tughlaq (Ghazi Malik) of the Tughluq dynasty between 1320 and 1325, though the city was again sacked in 1329 by Tarmashirin of the Central Asian Chagatai Khanate, and then again by the Mongol chief Hülechü. Khokhars seized Lahore in 1342, but the city was retaken by Ghazi Malik&#x27;s son, Muhammad bin Tughluq. The weakened city then fell into obscurity and was captured once more by the Khokhar chief, Shaikha in 1394. By the time the Mongol conqueror Timur captured the city in 1398 from Shaikha, he did not loot it because it was no longer wealthy.

====Late Sultanates====

Timur gave control of the Lahore region to Khizr Khan, governor of Multan, who later established the Sayyid dynasty in 1414 – the fourth dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. The city was twice besieged by Jasrat, ruler of Sialkot, during the reign of Mubarak Shah, the longest of which being in 1431–32. To combat Jasrat, the city was granted by the Sayyid dynasty to Bahlul Lodi in 1441, though Lodi would then displace the Sayyids in 1451 by establishing himself upon the throne of Delhi.

Bahlul Lodi installed his cousin, Tatar Khan, to be governor of the city, though Tatar Khan died in battle with Sikandar Lodi in 1485. Governorship of Lahore was transferred by Sikandar Lodi to Umar Khan Sarwani, who quickly left the management of this city to his son Said Khan Sarwani. Said Khan was removed from power in 1500 by Sikandar Lodi, and Lahore came under the governorship of Daulat Khan Lodi, son of Tatar Khan and former employer of Guru Nanak (the founder of Sikhism).

===Mughals===


====Early Mughal====
Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, captured and sacked Lahore and Dipalpur, although he retreated after the Lodi nobles backed away from assisting him. The city became a refuge to Humayun and his cousin Kamran Mirza when Sher Shah Suri rose in power in the Gangetic plains, displacing Mughals. Sher Shah Suri seized Lahore in 1540, though Humayun reconquered Lahore in February 1555. The establishment of Mughal rule eventually led to the most prosperous era of Lahore&#x27;s history. Lahore&#x27;s prosperity and central position has yielded more Mughal-era monuments in Lahore than either Delhi or Agra.

By the time of the rule of the Mughal empire&#x27;s greatest emperors, a majority of Lahore&#x27;s residents did not live within the walled city itself but instead lived in suburbs that had spread outside the city&#x27;s walls. Only 9 of the 36 urban quarters around Lahore, known as &quot;guzars&quot;, were located within the city walls during the Akbar period. During this period, Lahore was closely tied to smaller market towns known as &quot;qasbahs&quot;, such as Kasur and Eminabad, as well as Amritsar, and Batala in modern-day India, which in turn, linked to supply chains in villages surrounding each &quot;qasbah&quot;.

====Akbar====
Beginning in 1584, Lahore became the Mughal capital when Akbar began re-fortifying the city&#x27;s ruined citadel, laying the foundations for the revival of the Lahore Fort. Akbar made Lahore one of his original twelve &quot;subah&quot; provinces, and in 1585–86, relegated governorship of the city and &quot;subah&quot; to Bhagwant Das, brother of Mariam-uz-Zamani, who was commonly known as &quot;Jodhabhai&quot;.

Akbar also rebuilt the city&#x27;s walls and extended their perimeter east of the Shah Alami bazaar to encompass the sparsely populated area of Rarra Maidan. The Akbari Mandi grain market was set up during this era, which continues to function to the present-day. Akbar also established the Dharampura neighbourhood in the early 1580s, which survives today. The earliest of Lahore&#x27;s many havelis date from the Akbari era.

Lahore&#x27;s Mughal monuments were built under the reign of Akbar and several subsequent emperors. Lahore reached its cultural zenith during this period, with dozens of mosques, tombs, shrines, and urban infrastructure developed in the city.

====Jahangir====
During the reign of Emperor Jahangir in the early 17th century, Lahore&#x27;s bazaars were noted to be vibrant, frequented by foreigners, and stocked with a wide array of goods. In 1606, Jehangir&#x27;s rebel son Khusrau Mirza laid siege to Lahore after obtaining the blessings of the Sikh Guru Arjan Dev. Jehangir quickly defeated his son at Bhairowal, and the roots of Mughal–Sikh animosity grew. Sikh Guru Arjan Dev was executed in Lahore in 1606 for his involvement in the rebellion. Emperor Jahangir chose to be buried in Lahore, and his tomb was built in Lahore&#x27;s Shahdara Bagh suburb in 1637 by his wife Nur Jahan, whose tomb is also nearby.

====Shah Jahan====
Jahangir&#x27;s son, Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–1658), was born in Lahore in 1592. He renovated large portions of the Lahore Fort with luxurious white marble and erected the iconic Naulakha Pavilion in 1633. Shah Jahan lavished Lahore with some of its most celebrated and iconic monuments, such as the Shahi Hammam in 1635, and both the Shalimar Gardens and the extravagantly decorated Wazir Khan Mosque in 1641. The population of pre-modern Lahore probably reached its zenith during his reign, with suburban districts home to perhaps 6 times as many compared to within the Walled City.

====Aurangzeb====
Shah Jahan&#x27;s son, Aurangzeb, last of the great Mughal Emperors, further contributed to the development of Lahore. Aurangzeb built the Alamgiri Bund embankment along the Ravi river in 1662 in order to prevent its shifting course from threatening the city&#x27;s walls. The area near the embankment grew into a fashionable locality, with several nearby pleasure gardens laid by Lahore&#x27;s gentry. The largest of Lahore&#x27;s Mughal monuments, the Badshahi Mosque, was raised during Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign in 1673, as well as the iconic Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore fort in 1674.

====Late Mughal====

Civil wars regarding succession to the Mughal throne following Aurangzeb&#x27;s death in 1707 led to weakening control over Lahore from Delhi, and a prolonged period of decline in Lahore. Mughal preoccupation with the Marathas in the Deccan Plateau eventually resulted in Lahore being governed by a series of governors who pledged nominal allegiance to the ever-weaker Mughal emperors in Delhi.

Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah I died en route to Lahore as part of a campaign in 1711 to subdue Sikh rebels under the leadership of Banda Singh Bahadur. His sons fought a battle outside Lahore in 1712 for succession to the Mughal crown, with Jahandar winning the throne. Sikh rebels were defeated during the reign of Farrukhsiyar when Abd as-Samad and Zakariyya Khan suppressed them.

Nader Shah&#x27;s brief invasion of the Mughal Empire in early 1739 wrested control away from Zakariya Khan Bahadur. Though Khan was able to win back control after the Persian armies had left, the trade routes had shifted away from Lahore, and south towards Kandahar instead. Indus ports near the Arabian Sea that served Lahore also silted up during this time, reducing the city&#x27;s importance even further.

Struggles between Zakariyya Khan&#x27;s sons following his death in 1745 further weakened Muslim control over Lahore, thus leaving the city in a power vacuum, and vulnerable to foreign marauders.

=== Durrani invasions ===
The Durrani ruler Ahmad Shah occupied Lahore in 1748. Following Ahmed Shah Durrani&#x27;s quick retreat, the Mughals entrusted Lahore to Mu’īn al-Mulk Mir Mannu. Ahmad Shah again invaded in 1751, forcing Mir Mannu into signing a treaty that nominally subjected Lahore to Durrani rule. Lahore was third time conquered by Ahmad Shah in 1752. The Mughal Grand Vizier Ghazi-Din Imad al-Mulk seized Lahore in 1756, provoking Ahmad Shah to invade for fourth time in 1757, after which he placed the city under the rule of his son, Timur Shah.

Durrani rule was interrupted when Lahore was conquered by Adina Beg Arain with the assistance of Marathas in 1758 during their campaigns against Afghans. After Adina Beg&#x27;s untimely death in 1758, however, Marathas temporarily occupied the city. The following year, Durranis again marched into Lahore and conquered it. After the Durranis withdrew from the city in 1765, Sikh forces quickly occupied it. By this time, the city had been ravaged several time and had lost all of its former grandeur. The Durranis invaded two more times—in 1797 and 1798—under Shah Zaman, but the Sikhs re-occupied the city after both invasions as the Durranis were forced to attend to other problems on their western borders.

=== Sikh ===

====Early====
Expanding Sikh Misls secured control over Lahore in 1767, when the Bhangi Misl state captured the city. In 1780, the city was divided among three rulers: Gujjar Singh, Lahna Singh, and Sobha Singh. Instability resulting from this arrangement allowed nearby Amritsar to establish itself as the area&#x27;s primary commercial centre in place of Lahore.

Ahmad Shah Durrani&#x27;s grandson, Zaman Shah, captured Lahore in 1796, and again in 1798–99. Ranjit Singh negotiated with the Afghans for the post of &quot;subahdar&quot; to control Lahore following the second invasion.

By the end of the 18th century, the city&#x27;s population drastically declined, with its remaining residents living within the city walls, while the extramural suburbs lay abandoned, forcing travellers to pass through abandoned and ruined suburbs for a few miles before reaching the city&#x27;s gates.

====Sikh Empire====
In the aftermath of Zaman Shah&#x27;s 1799 invasion of Punjab, Ranjit Singh, of nearby Gujranwala, began to consolidate his position. Singh was able to seize control of the region after a series of battles with the Bhangi chiefs who had seized Lahore in 1780. His army marched to Anarkali, where according to legend, the gatekeeper of the Lohari Gate, Mukham Din Chaudhry, opened the gates allowing Ranjit Singh&#x27;s army to enter Lahore. After capturing Lahore, Sikh soldiers immediately began plundering Muslim areas of the city until their actions were reined in by Ranjit Singh.

Ranjit Singh&#x27;s rule restored some of Lahore&#x27;s lost grandeur, but at the expense of destroying the remaining Mughal architecture for building materials. He established a mint in the city in 1800, and moved into the Mughal palace at the Lahore fort after repurposing it for his own use in governing the Sikh Empire. In 1801, he established a Gurdwara Ram Das to mark the site where Guru Ram Das was born in 1534.

Lahore became the empire&#x27;s administrative capital, though the nearby economic centre of Amritsar had also been established as the empire&#x27;s spiritual capital by 1802. By 1812, Singh had mostly refurbished the city&#x27;s defences by adding a second circuit of outer walls surrounding Akbar&#x27;s original walls, with the two separated by a moat. Singh also partially restored Shah Jahan&#x27;s decaying Shalimar Gardens and built the Hazuri Bagh Baradari in 1818 to celebrate his capture of the Koh-i-Noor diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani in 1813. He erected the Gurdwara Dera Sahib to mark the site of Guru Arjan Dev&#x27;s death (1606). The Sikh royal court also endowed religious architecture in the city, including a number of Sikh gurdwaras, Hindu temples, and havelis.

While much of Lahore&#x27;s Mughal-era fabric lay in ruins by the time of his arrival, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s rule saw the re-establishment of Lahore&#x27;s glory, though the Mughal monuments suffered during the Sikh period. Singh&#x27;s armies plundered most of Lahore&#x27;s most precious Mughal monuments, and stripped the white marble from several monuments to send to different parts of the Sikh Empire during his reign. Monuments plundered for decorative materials include the Tomb of Asif Khan, the Tomb of Nur Jahan, and the Shalimar Gardens. Ranjit Singh&#x27;s army also desecrated the Badshahi Mosque by converting it into an ammunition depot and a stable for horses. The Sunehri Mosque in the Walled City was also converted to a gurdwara, while the Mariyam Zamani Mosque was repurposed into a gunpowder factory.

==== Late ====
The Sikh royal court (&quot;Lahore Durbar&quot;) underwent a quick succession of rulers after the death of Ranjit Singh. His son Kharak Singh died on 6 November 1840, soon after taking the throne. On that same day, the next appointed successor to the throne, Nau Nihal Singh, died in an accident at the gardens of Hazuri Bagh. Maharaja Sher Singh was then selected as Maharajah, though his claim to the throne was quickly challenged by Chand Kaur, widow of Kharak Singh and mother of Nau Nihal Singh, who quickly seized the throne. Sher Singh raised an army that attacked Chand Kaur&#x27;s forces in Lahore on 14 January 1841. His soldiers mounted weaponry on the minarets of the Badshahi Mosque in order to target Chand Kaur&#x27;s forces in the Lahore fort, destroying the fort&#x27;s historic &quot;Diwan-e-Aam&quot;. Kaur quickly ceded the throne, but Sher Sing was then assassinated in 1843 in Lahore&#x27;s &quot;Chah Miran&quot; neighbourhood along with his wazir Dhiyan Singh. Dhyan Singh&#x27;s son, Hira Singh, sought to avenge his father&#x27;s death by laying siege to Lahore in order to capture his father&#x27;s assassins. The siege resulted in the capture of his father&#x27;s murderer, Ajit Singh. Duleep Singh was then crowned Maharajah, with Hira Singh as his &quot;wazir&quot;, but his power would be weakened by the continued infighting among Sikh nobles, as well as confrontations against the British during the two Anglo-Sikh wars.

After the conclusion of the two Anglo-Sikh wars, the Sikh Empire fell into disarray, resulting in the fall of the &quot;Lahore Durbar&quot;, and commencement of British rule after they captured Lahore and the wider Punjab region.

=== British colonial period ===


The British East India Company seized control of Lahore in February 1846 from the collapsing Sikh state and occupied the rest of Punjab in 1848. Following the defeat of the Sikhs at the Battle of Gujrat, British troops formally deposed Maharaja Duleep Singh in Lahore that same year. Punjab was then annexed to the British Indian Empire in 1849.

At the commencement of British rule, Lahore was estimated to have a population of 120,000. Prior to annexation by the British, Lahore&#x27;s environs consisted mostly of the Walled City surrounded by plains interrupted by settlements to the south and east, such as Mozang and Qila Gujar Singh, which have since been engulfed by modern Lahore. The plains between the settlements also contained the remains of Mughal gardens, tombs, and Sikh-era military structures.

The British viewed Lahore&#x27;s Walled City as a bed of potential social discontent and disease epidemics, and so largely left the inner city alone, while focusing development efforts in Lahore&#x27;s suburban areas and Punjab&#x27;s fertile countryside. The British instead laid out their capital city in an area south of the Walled City that would first come to be known as &quot;Donald&#x27;s Town&quot; before being renamed &quot;Civil Station&quot;.

Under early British rule, formerly prominent Mughal-era monuments that were scattered throughout Civil Station were also re-purposed and sometimes desecrated – including the Tomb of Anarkali, which the British had initially converted to clerical offices before re-purposing it as an Anglican church in 1851. The 17th-century Dai Anga Mosque was converted into railway administration offices during this time, the tomb of Nawab Bahadur Khan was converted into a storehouse, and the tomb of Mir Mannu was used as a wine shop. The British also used older structures to house municipal offices, such as the Civil Secretariat, Public Works Department, and Accountant General&#x27;s Office.
The British built the Lahore Railway Station just outside the Walled City shortly after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857; the station was therefore styled as a medieval castle to ward off any potential future uprisings, with thick walls, turrets, and holes to direct gun and cannon fire for the defence of the structure. Lahore&#x27;s most prominent government institutions and commercial enterprises came to be concentrated in Civil Station in a half-mile wide area flanking The Mall, where unlike in Lahore&#x27;s military zone, the British and locals were allowed to mix. The Mall continues to serve as the epicentre of Lahore&#x27;s civil administration, as well as one of its most fashionable commercial areas. The British also laid the spacious Lahore Cantonment to the southeast of the Walled City at the former village of Mian Mir, where unlike around The Mall, laws did exist against the mixing of different races.

Lahore was visited on 9 February 1870 by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh – a visit in which he received delegations from the Dogras of Jammu, Maharajas of Patiala, the Nawab of Bahawalpur, and other rulers from various Punjabi states. During the visit, he visited several of Lahore&#x27;s major sights. British authorities built several important structures around the time of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria (1887) in the distinctive Indo-Saracenic style, including the Lahore Museum and Mayo School of Industrial Arts.

The British carried out a census of Lahore in 1901, and counted 20,691 houses in the Walled City. An estimated 200,000 people lived in Lahore at this time. Lahore&#x27;s posh Model Town was established as a &quot;garden town&quot; suburb in 1921, while Krishan Nagar locality was laid in the 1930s near The Mall and Walled City.

Lahore played an important role in the independence movements of both India and Pakistan. The Declaration of the Independence of India was moved by Jawaharlal Nehru and passed unanimously at midnight on 31 December 1929 at Lahore&#x27;s Bradlaugh Hall. The Indian &quot;Swaraj&quot; flag was adopted this time as well. Lahore&#x27;s jail was used by the British to imprison independence activists such as Jatin Das, and was also where Bhagat Singh was hanged in 1931. Under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the All India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution in 1940, demanding the creation of Pakistan as a separate homeland for the Muslims of India.

=== Partition ===
The 1941 census showed that city of Lahore had a population of 671,659, of which was 64.5% Muslim, with the remainder 35% being Hindu and Sikh, alongside a small Christian community. The population figure was disputed by Hindus and Sikhs before the Boundary Commission that would draw the Radcliffe Line to demarcate the border of the two new states based on religious demography. In a bid to have Lahore awarded to India, they argued that the city was only 54% Muslim, and that Hindu and Sikh domination of the city&#x27;s economy and educational institutions should trump Muslim demography. Two-thirds of shops, and 80% of Lahore&#x27;s factories belonged to the Hindu and Sikh community. Kuldip Nayyar claimed that Cyril Radcliffe had told him in 1971 that he originally had planned to give Lahore to the new Dominion of India, but decided to place it within the Dominion of Pakistan, which he saw as lacking a major city as he had already awarded Calcutta to India.

As tensions grew over the city&#x27;s uncertain fate, Lahore experienced Partition&#x27;s worst riots. Carnage ensued in which all three religious groups were both victims and perpetrators. Early riots in March and April 1947 destroyed 6,000 of Lahore&#x27;s 82,000 homes. Violence continued to rise throughout the summer, despite the presence of armoured British personnel. Hindus and Sikhs began to leave the city &quot;en masse&quot; as their hopes that the Boundary Commission would award the city to India came to be regarded as increasingly unlikely. By late August 1947, 66% of Hindus and Sikhs had left the city. The Shah Alami Bazaar, once a largely Hindu quarter of the Walled City, was entirely burnt down during subsequent rioting.

When Pakistan&#x27;s independence was declared on 14 August 1947, the Radcliffe Line had not yet been announced, and so cries of &quot;Long live Pakistan&quot; and &quot;God is greatest&quot; were heard intermittently with &quot;Long live Hindustan&quot; throughout the night. On 17 August 1947, Lahore was awarded to Pakistan on the basis of its Muslim majority in the 1941 census and was made capital of the Punjab province in the new state of Pakistan. The city&#x27;s location near the Indian border meant that it received large numbers of refugees fleeing eastern Punjab and northern India, though it was able to accommodate them given the large stock of abandoned Hindu and Sikh properties that could be re-distributed to newly arrived refugees.

=== Modern ===
Partition left Lahore with a much-weakened economy, and a stymied social and cultural scene that had previously been invigorated by the city&#x27;s Hindus and Sikhs. Industrial production dropped to one-third of pre-Partition level by the end of the 1940s, and only 27% of its manufacturing units were operating by 1950, and usually well-below capacity. Capital flight further weakened the city&#x27;s economy while Karachi industrialized and became more prosperous.

The city&#x27;s weakened economy, and proximity to the Indian border, meant that the city was deemed unsuitable to be the Pakistani capital after independence. Karachi was therefore chosen to be the capital on account of its relative tranquility during the Partition period, stronger economy, and better infrastructure.
After independence, Lahore slowly regained its significance as an economic and cultural centre of western Punjab. Reconstruction began in 1949 of the Shah Alami Bazaar, the former commercial heart of the Walled City until it was destroyed in the 1947 riots. The Tomb of Allama Iqbal was built in 1951 to honour the philosopher-poet who provided the spiritual inspiration for the Pakistan movement. In 1955, Lahore was selected to be the capital of all West Pakistan during the single-unit period that lasted until 1970. Shortly afterwards, Lahore&#x27;s iconic Minar-e-Pakistan was completed in 1968 to mark the spot where the Pakistan Resolution was passed. With support from the United Nations, the government was able to rebuild Lahore, and most scars from the communal violence of Partition were ameliorated.

The second Islamic Summit Conference was held in the city in 1974. In retaliation for the destruction of the Babri Masjid in India, riots erupted in 1992 in which several non-Muslim monuments were targeted, including the tomb of Maharaja Sher Singh, and the former Jain temple near The Mall. In 1996, the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup final match was held at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.

The Walled City of Lahore restoration project began in 2009, when the Punjab government restored the Royal Trail from Akbari Gate to the Lahore Fort with money from the World Bank.

The highest rainfall in a 24-hour period is , recorded on 1 August 2024.

== Demographics ==

=== Population ===
The results of the 2017 Census determined the population of Lahore to be 11,126,285, with an annual growth rate of 4.07% since 1998. Gender-wise, 52.35% of the population are male, 47.64% are female, and 0.01% are transgender. Lahore is a demographically young city, with over 40% of its inhabitants below the age of 15.

=== Tribes and background ===
At the time of the 2017 Pakistani census, the largest tribal group were Arain Punjabis, constituting 40%, followed by Punjabi–Kashmiris at 30% with other tribes such as Rajput Punjabis and Kamboh Punjabis at 5% each. The majority of the rest 20% is constituted by other Punjabi tribes, with a minority constituted by other ethnic communities such as Muhajirs, Pashtuns and Meo.

==== Controversy about the city&#x27;s Pashtun population ====
Some Pashtun nationalist parties argue that the Pashtun population of Lahore in the 2017 census has been underestimated, with Ameer Bahadur Khan, provincial general secretary of Awami National Party, putting their numbers at 1.5 million, while Gul Muhammad Regwal, a member of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, claiming more than 1 million including 300,000 in the Walled City alone, most of these having moved over the last 20 years, including due to military operations, but remaining uncounted as they&#x27;re not considered permanent residents of Lahore.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2023 Census, the vast majority of Lahore&#x27;s population are Muslims (95.26%), up from 94.7% in 2017. Other religions include Christians (4.64%, slightly less than 5.14% in 2017) and small numbers of Ahmadis, Baháʼís, Hindus, Parsis, and Sikhs. There is also a small but longstanding Zoroastrian community.

Since Lahore contains some of Sikhism&#x27;s holiest sites, it is a major pilgrimage destination for Sikhs. Lahore&#x27;s first church was built during the reign of Emperor Akbar in the late 16th century, but was then leveled by Shah Jahan in 1632. Due to the few numbers of Hindus living in Lahore, the only two functional Hindu temples in the city are the Shri Krishna Mandir and the Valmiki Mandir.

===Languages===
The Punjabi language is the most-widely spoken native language in Lahore, with 73.58% of Lahore counting it as their first language according to the 2023 Census. Lahore is the largest Punjabi-speaking city in the world. According to the 2023 Pakistani census 21.1% speak Urdu, 2.06% Pashto, 2.01% Mewati and 2.78% other mother tongues.

Urdu and English are used as official languages and as mediums of instruction and media administration. However, Punjabi is also taught at graduation level and used in theatres, films, and newspapers from Lahore. Several Lahore-based prominent educational leaders, researchers, and social commentators have demanded that the Punjabi language should be declared as the medium of instruction at the primary level and be used officially in the Punjab Assembly, Lahore.

== Cityscape ==
=== Old City ===

Lahore&#x27;s modern cityscape consists of the historic Walled City of Lahore in the northern part of the city, which contains several World Heritage Sites and national heritage sites. Lahore&#x27;s urban planning was not based on geometric design but was instead built piecemeal, with small cul-de-sacs, as &quot;katrahs&quot; and &quot;galis&quot; developed in the context of neighbouring buildings. Though certain neighbourhoods were named for particular religious or ethnic communities, the neighbourhoods themselves typically were diverse and were not dominated by the namesake group.
Lahore&#x27;s urban typology is similar to other ancient cities in South Asia, such as Peshawar, Multan and Delhi – all of which were founded near a major river, and included an old walled city and royal citadel.

By the end of the Sikh rule, most of Lahore&#x27;s massive haveli compounds had been occupied by settlers. New neighbourhoods occasionally grew up entirely within the confines of an old Mughal haveli, such as the Mohallah Pathan Wali, which grew within the ruins of a haveli of the same name, built by Mian Khan. By 1831, all Mughal Havelis in the Walled City had been encroached upon by the surrounding neighbourhood, leading to the modern-day absence of any Mughal Havelis in Lahore.

A total of thirteen gates once surrounded the historic walled city. Some of the remaining gates include the Raushnai Gate, Masti Gate, Yakki Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Khizri Gate, Shah Burj Gate, Akbari Gate, and Lahori Gate. Southeast of the walled city is the spacious British-era Lahore Cantonment.

=== Architecture ===

Lahore is home to numerous monuments from the Mughal Dynasty, Sikh Empire, and the British Indian Raj. The architectural style of the Walled City of Lahore has traditionally been influenced by Mughal and Sikh styles.

====Sikh period====
By the arrival of the Sikh Empire at the end of the 18th century, Lahore had decayed from its former glory as the Mughal capital. Rebuilding efforts under Ranjit Singh and his successors were influenced by Mughal practices, and Lahore was known as the &#x27;City of Gardens&#x27; during the Ranjit Singh period. Later, British maps of the area surrounding Lahore dating from the mid-19th century show many walled private gardens which were confiscated from the Muslim noble families bearing the names of prominent Sikh nobles – a pattern of patronage which was inherited from the Mughals.

While much of Lahore&#x27;s Mughal-era fabric lay in ruins by the time of his arrival, Ranjit Singh&#x27;s army&#x27;s plundered most of Lahore&#x27;s most precious Mughal monuments, and stripped the white marble from several monuments to send to different parts of the Sikh Empire. Monuments plundered of their marble include the Tomb of Asif Khan and the Tomb of Nur Jahan; the Shalimar Gardens was plundered of much of its marble, and its costly agate gate was stripped. The Sikh state also demolished a number of shrines and monuments laying outside the city&#x27;s walls.

Still, Sikh rule left Lahore with several monuments, and a heavily altered Lahore Fort. Ranjit Singh&#x27;s rule restored some of Lahore&#x27;s previous grandeur, and the city was left with a large number of religious monuments from this period. Several havelis were built during this era, though only a few still remain.

====British period====
As the capital of British Punjab, the city derived much of its architecture from British colonialists. Structures were built predominantly in the Indo-Gothic style – a syncretic architectural style that blends elements of Victorian and Islamic architecture o r in the distinct Indo-Saracenic style. The British also built neoclassical Montgomery Hall, which today serves as the Quaid-e-Azam Library.

Lawrence Gardens were also laid near Civil Station, and were paid for by donations solicited from both Lahore&#x27;s European community, as well as from wealthy locals. The gardens featured over 600 species of plants, and were tended to by a horticulturist sent from London&#x27;s Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew.

The leafy suburbs to the south of the Old City, as well as the Cantonment southwest of the Old City, were largely developed under British colonial rule, and feature colonial-era buildings built alongside leafy avenues.

The British authorities built several important structures around the time of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887 in the distinctive Indo-Saracenic style, such as the Lahore Museum and Mayo School of Industrial Arts. Other prominent examples of the Indo-Saracenic style in Lahore include Lahore&#x27;s prestigious Aitchison College, the Punjab Chief Court (today the Lahore High Court), Lahore Museum, and the University of the Punjab.

Many of Lahore&#x27;s most important buildings were designed by civil engineer and architect Sir Ganga Ram, who is considered &quot;the father of modern Lahore&quot;.

=== Parks and gardens ===

Lahore is also known as &quot;the city of gardens&quot; due to its large number of gardens. The Shahdara Bagh was one of the earliest Mughal gardens, laid out in 15th century, and contains the Tomb of Jahangir. The Shalimar Gardens were laid out during the reign of Shah Jahan and were designed to mimic the Islamic paradise of the afterlife described in the Qur&#x27;an. The gardens follow the familiar charbagh layout of four squares, with three descending terraces. In 1818, Hazuri Bagh was built during reign of Ranjit Singh to celebrate his capture of the Koh-i-Noor diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani.

The Lawrence Garden was established in 1862 and was originally named after Sir John Lawrence, late 19th-century British Viceroy to India. The Circular Garden, which surrounds the Walled City on three sides, was established by 1892. The former parade ground adjacent to Badshahi Mosque was also renamed during the British era as Minto Park, which after restoration was re-established as Iqbal Park.

The many other gardens and parks in the city include Hazuri Bagh, Iqbal Park, Mochi Bagh, Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park, Model Town Park, Jilani Park, Nasir Bagh Lahore, Jallo Park, Lahore Zoo Safari Park, and Changa Manga, a human-made forest near Lahore in the Kasur district. Another example is the Bagh-e-Jinnah, a botanical garden that houses entertainment and sports facilities as well as a library.

== Economy ==

, the city&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) by purchasing power parity (PPP) was estimated at $40 billion with a projected average growth rate of 5.6 percent. This is on par with Karachi, Pakistan&#x27;s economic hub, with Lahore (having half the population) fostering an economy that is 51% of the size of Karachi&#x27;s ($78 billion in 2008). It is estimated that Lahore contributes 11.5% to the national economy, and 19% to the provincial economy of Punjab. As a whole, Punjab has a $115 billion economy, making it the first (and to date, only) Pakistani Subdivision with an economy of more than $100 billion, at the rank 144. Lahore&#x27;s GDP is projected to be $102 billion by 2025, with a slightly higher growth rate of 5.6% per annum, as compared to Karachi&#x27;s 5.5%.

A major industrial agglomeration with about 9,000 industrial units, Lahore has shifted in recent decades from manufacturing to service industries. Some 42% of its workforce is employed in finance, banking, real estate, community, cultural, and social services. The city is Pakistan&#x27;s largest software and hardware producing centre, and hosts a growing computer-assembly industry. The city has always been a centre for publications; 80% of Pakistan&#x27;s books are published in Lahore, and it remains the foremost centre of literary, educational, and cultural activity in Pakistan.

The Lahore Expo Centre is one of the biggest projects in the history of the city and was inaugurated on 22 May 2010. Defence Raya Golf Resort, now fully operational (as of the 2024), boasts Pakistan’s largest and Asia&#x27;s premier golf course. This luxurious project is a result of a partnership between DHA Lahore and BRDB Malaysia, offering world-class residential, recreational, and commercial facilities. The development of such large-scale projects continues to elevate Lahore’s profile, contributing significantly to the national economy. Ferozepur Road of the Central business districts of Lahore contains high-rises and skyscrapers including Kayre International Hotel and Arfa Software Technology Park.

== Transport ==

=== Public transportation ===

Lahore&#x27;s main public transportation system is operated by the Lahore Transport Company (LTC) and Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMTA).

The Orange Line Metro Train is an automated rapid transit system in Lahore. The Orange line is the first of the three proposed rail lines proposed for the Lahore Metro. As of 2020, it is the primary metro rail line in the city. The line spans , with elevated and underground, and had a cost of 251.06 billion rupees ($1.6 billion). The line consists of 26 subway stations (Ali Town Station to Dera Gujran Station) and is designed to carry over 250,000 passengers daily. CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive rolled out the first of 27 trains for the metro on 16 May 2017. The train has speed up to . For improved durability, its bogies are heat-resistant, can manage unstable voltage, and feature energy-saving air-conditioning. Successful initial test trials were run in mid-2018, and commercial operations began on 25 October 2020.

====Blue Line====

Auto rickshaws play an important role of public transport in Lahore. As of 2019, there were approximately 82,000 auto rickshaws and 65,000 motorcycle rickshaws in the city. Motorcycle rickshaws, usually called &quot;chingchi&quot; (after the Chinese company Jinan Qingqi Motorcycle Co. Ltd, who first introduced these to the market) or &quot;chand gari&quot; (&#x27;moon car&#x27;) are cheaper than auto rickshaws and provide a shared ride experience for multiple passengers and fares, whereas auto rickshaws cater to only one passenger or group for a fare. Since 2002, all auto rickshaws have been required to use compressed natural gas as fuel, and all-electric rickshaws were introduced in 2023.

Lahore Jinnah Bus Terminal is also a major bus stand in southern Lahore. Apart from these stations, multiple privately owned bus transportation companies operate from Band Road (referred to colloquially as Chowk Yateem Khana), offering intercity transport at varying fares and comfort levels.

=== Airports ===
Pakistan&#x27;s third busiest airport, Allama Iqbal International Airport (IATA: LHE), straddles the city&#x27;s eastern boundary. The new passenger terminal was opened in 2003, replacing the old terminal which now serves as a VIP and Hajj lounge. The airport was named after the national poet-philosopher, Muhammad Iqbal, and is a secondary hub for the national carrier, Pakistan International Airlines. Walton Airport in Askari neighbourhood provides general aviation facilities. Sialkot International Airport (IATA: SKT) and Faisalabad International Airport (IATA: LYP) also serve as alternate airports for the Lahore area, in addition to serving their respective cities.

For example, the mausoleum of Ali Hujwiri at the Data Darbar shrine has an annual &quot;urs&quot; that attracts up to one million visitors per year. The popular Mela Chiraghan festival in Lahore takes place at the shrine of Madho Lal Hussain, while other large &quot;urs&quot; take place at the shrines of Bibi Pak Daman, and at the Shrine of Mian Mir. Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha are celebrated in the city with public buildings and shopping centers decorated in lights.

Basant is a traditional Punjabi festival that marks the coming of spring. Basant celebrations in Pakistan are centered in Lahore, and people from all over the country and abroad come to the city for the annual festivities. Kite-flying competitions traditionally take place on city rooftops during Basant, while the Lahore Canal is decorated with floating lanterns. Courts have banned kite-flying because of casualties and power installation losses. The ban was lifted for two days in 2007, then immediately reimposed when 11 people were killed by celebratory gunfire, sharp kite-strings, electrocution, and falls related to the competition.

Lahore&#x27;s churches are elaborately decorated for Christmas and Easter celebrations. Shopping centers and public buildings also feature Christmas installations to celebrate the holiday, even though Christians only constitute 5.1% of the total population of Lahore in 2024. Religion in Lahore

Lahore has successfully hosted many international sports events, including the finals of the 1990 Men&#x27;s Hockey World Cup and the 1996 Cricket World Cup. The headquarters of all major sports governing bodies in Pakistan are located in Lahore, including cricket, hockey, rugby, and football. Lahore is also home to the head office of the Pakistan Olympic Association.

Gaddafi Stadium is a Test cricket ground in Lahore. It was completed in 1959, and renovations were carried out by Pakistani architect Nayyar Ali Dada in the 1990s.

The multi purpose Punjab Stadium located near the headquarters of the Pakistan Football Federation, is mainly used for football matches and has hosted several events including AFC President&#x27;s Cup and FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

Lahore is home to several golf courses, including the Lahore Gymkhana Golf Course, the Lahore Garrison Golf and Country Club, the Royal Palm Golf Club, and newly built Defence Raya Golf &amp; Country Club. Lake City, a 9-hole course, opened in nearby Raiwind Road in 2011. The newly opened Oasis Golf and Aqua Resort is a state-of-the-art resort, featuring golf, water parks, and leisure activities like horse riding and archery.

The Lahore Marathon is part of an annual package of six international marathons sponsored by Standard Chartered Bank across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. More than 20,000 athletes from Pakistan and all over the world participate in this event. It was first held on 30 January 2005, and again on 29 January 2006. More than 22,000 people participated in the 2006 race. The third marathon was held on 14 January 2007.

<text>Louis Jolliet (; September 21, 1645after May 1700) was a French-Canadian explorer known for his discoveries in North America. In 1673, Jolliet and Jacques Marquette, a Jesuit Catholic priest and missionary, were the first non-Natives to explore and map the Upper Mississippi River.

==Early life==
Jolliet was born in 1645 in Beaupré, a French settlement near Quebec City, to Jean Jolliet and Marie D&#x27;Abancourt. When he was six years old, his father died; his mother married a successful merchant, Geoffroy Guillot dit Lavalle, until he died in 1665. Shortly after the passing of his mother&#x27;s second husband, she was married to Martin Prevost until she died in 1678. Jolliet&#x27;s stepfather owned land on the Ile d&#x27;Orleans, an island in the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec that was home to First Nations. Jolliet spent much time on Ile d&#x27;Orleans, so he likely began speaking Indigenous languages of the Americas at a young age. Besides French, he also learned English and Spanish. During his childhood, Quebec was the center of the French fur trade. The Natives were part of daily life in Quebec, and Jolliet grew up knowing much about them. Jolliet entered a Jesuit school in Quebec as a child and focused on philosophical and religious studies, aiming for the priesthood. He also studied music, becoming a skilled harpsichordist and church organist. He received Holy Orders in 1662 but abandoned his plans to become a priest, leaving the seminary in 1667 to pursue fur trading instead.

==Exploration of the Upper Mississippi==
While Hernando de Soto was the first European to make official note of the Mississippi River by discovering its southern entrance in 1541, Jolliet and Marquette were the first to locate its upper reaches, and travel most of its length, about 130 years later. De Soto had named the river Rio del Espiritu Santo, but tribes along its length called it variations of &quot;Mississippi&quot;, meaning &quot;Great River&quot; in the Algonquian languages.

On May 17, 1673, Jolliet and Marquette departed from St. Ignace, Michigan, with two canoes and five other voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry. The group sailed to Green Bay. They then paddled upstream (southward) on the Fox River to the site now known as Portage, Wisconsin. There, they portaged a distance of slightly less than two miles through marsh and oak forest to the Wisconsin River. Europeans eventually built a trading post at that shortest convenient portage between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins. On June 17, the canoeists ventured onto the Mississippi River near present-day Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.

The Jolliet-Marquette expedition paddled along the west bank of the Mississippi until mid-July. When they passed the mouth of the Arkansas River, they became satisfied that they had established that the Mississippi flowed into the Gulf of Mexico. By this point, they had encountered natives carrying European goods and worried about a possible hostile encounter with explorers or colonists from Spain. The voyageurs then followed the Mississippi back to the mouth of the Illinois River, which friendly natives told them was a shorter route back to the Great Lakes. Following the Illinois river upstream, they then turned up its tributary the Des Plaines River near modern-day Joliet, Illinois. They then continued up the Des Plaines River and portaged their canoes and gear at the Chicago Portage. They then followed the Chicago River downstream until they reached Lake Michigan near the location of modern-day Chicago. Father Marquette stayed at the mission of St. Francis Xavier at the southern end of Green Bay, which they reached in August. Jolliet returned to Quebec to relate the news of their discoveries. On his way through the Lachine Rapids, Jolliet&#x27;s canoe overturned and his records were lost. His brief narrative, written from memory, is in essential agreement with Marquette&#x27;s, the chief account of the journey.

==Later years==
Jolliet married Claire-Françoise Byssot de la Valtrie. Like Jolliet, she was Canadian born, a daughter of Francois Byssot de la Riviere and his wife Marie Couillard. Claire Francoise was also a sister of Louise Byssot de la Valtrie, wife of Seraphin de Margane, Seigneur de la Valtrie. In 1680, Jolliet was granted the Island of Antwhere by Louis XIV as a reward, where he created a fort and maintained soldiers. In 1693, he was appointed &quot;Royal Hydrographer&quot;, and on April 30, 1697, he was granted a seigneury southwest of Quebec City which he named Jolliest.

In 1694, he sailed from the Gulf of St. Lawrence north along the coast of Labrador as far north as Zoar, a voyage of five and a half months. He recorded details of the country, navigation, the Inuit and their customs. His journal (&quot;Journal de Louis Jolliet allant à la decouverte de Labrador, 1694,&quot;) is the earliest known detailed survey of the Labrador coast from the Strait of Belle Isle to Zoar.

In May 1700, Louis Jolliet left for Anticosti Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. He then disappears from the historical record. There is no listing of his death or burial place, and the sole record of his fate is the notation that a mass for his soul was said in Quebec on September 15, 1700.

==Legacy==
Jolliet&#x27;s main legacy is most tangible in the Midwestern United States and Quebec, mostly through geographical names, including the cities of Joliet, Illinois; Joliet, Montana; and Joliette, Quebec (founded by one of Jolliet&#x27;s descendants, Barthélemy Joliette).

The several variations in the spelling of the name &quot;Jolliet&quot; reflect spelling that occurred at times when illiteracy or poor literacy was common and spelling was unstandardized. Jolliet&#x27;s descendants live throughout eastern Canada and the United States. 

The Jolliet Squadron of cadets at the Royal Military College Saint-Jean in the Province of Quebec was named in Jolliet&#x27;s honor. A street and subway station in Montreal, Quebec are named after him. The Louis Jolliet rose, developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, was named in his honor. Joliet Junior College in Joliet, Illinois, is named after the explorer, as are numerous high schools in North America. The Louis Joliet Mall in Joliet, Illinois, is named for the explorer. A cruise ship sailing out of Quebec City is also named in his honour.

Jolliet appears with Jacques Marquette on a 1968 United States postage stamp honoring their exploratory voyage.

<text>The ST-506 and ST-412 (sometimes written ST506 and ST412) were early hard disk drive products introduced by Seagate in 1980 and 1981 respectively, that later became construed as hard disk drive interfaces: the ST-506 disk interface and the ST-412 disk interface. Introduced in 1980, the ST-506 was the first 5.25 inch HDD. Its successor, the ST-412, was introduced in 1981 and implemented a refinement to the seek speed, and increased the drive capacity from 5 MB to 10 MB, but was otherwise highly similar.

Beginning with its selection as the hard drive subsystem for the original IBM XT disk drive controllers supporting the ST-412 interface grew to become ubiquitous in the personal computer industry, The ST-412 interface and its variants were the de facto industry standard for personal computer hard disks until the advent and wider adoption of the IDE or ATA interface in the early 1990s.

Both interfaces used MFM encoding; the subsequent extension of the ST-412 interface, the ST-412HP interface, used RLL encoding for a 50% increase in capacity and bit rate.

== History ==
The ST-506 HDD was the first 5.25 inch hard disk drive, introduced in 1980 by Shugart Technology (now Seagate Technology). It stored up to 5 megabytes after formatting (153 cylinders, 4 heads, 32 sectors/track, 256 bytes/sector) and cost US$1,500 (). The similar, 10-megabyte ST-412 HDD was introduced in late 1981 (with 306 cylinders). The ST225 was introduced shortly thereafter with 20 megabytes and half the height. All three used MFM encoding, a widely used coding scheme. A subsequent extension of the ST-412 interface, the ST-412HP interface, used RLL encoding for a 50% increase in capacity and bit rate.

The ST-506 drive connected to a computer system through a disk controller. The ST-506 interface between the controller and drive was derived from the Shugart Associates SA1000 interface, which was in turn based upon the floppy disk drive interface, thereby making disk controller design relatively easy.

The ST-412 interface was adopted by numerous HDD manufacturers such that the interface became a &quot;de facto&quot; industry standard for disk drives well into the 1990s.

The limitations of the ST-412 interface are 5 million transitions per second maximum on data lines, 16 heads, 4 drive units and a cable length. The standard channel code for the ST-412 (and ST-506) is MFM with one data bit per transition for a data rate of 5 Mbit/s. The ST-412HP RLL variant averages 1.5 data bits per transition for a data rate of 7.5 Mbit/s.

== Interface to controller ==
In the ST-506 interface, the drive connects to a controller card with two ribbon cables carrying signals, while a third cable provides power. The two signal cables are the wide 34-pin &quot;control cable&quot; and the narrow 20-pin &quot;data cable&quot;. The control cable interface is very similar to the standard Shugart floppy disk interface; like that floppy disk interface, it can support four drives. The data cable carries a read signal and write signal, both as differential binary signals: the two signal states correspond to the two possible differential signal polarities. The data represented by these signals is MFM, so the absolute signal states are not significant: the data is represented in the timing of the state transitions, like in floppy disk systems. While up to four drives can share a control cable, each drive has its own dedicated data cable connecting it to the hard disk controller (HDC). Most HDCs supported only two drives.

The control card translates requests for a particular track and sector from the host system into a sequence of head positioning commands, including setting the direction of head movement, in or out, and sending individual &quot;STEP&quot; commands to move. Four of the control cable pins, &quot;HD SLCT 0&quot; through &quot;HD SLCT 3&quot;, allow the selection among up to 16 heads, although only four are available on the two-platter ST-506. The original ST-506/ST-412 interface defined only two HD SLCT lines, providing supporting for only four heads, but a third HD SLCT line was shortly added to the design; a fourth was added a not much later by redefining the reduced Write Current signal, needed only by very early drives, as HD SLCT 3. Once the heads are properly positioned and the appropriate head is selected, data is read or written serially through a set of pins in the data cable. The limited bandwidth of the data cable was not an issue at the time and is not the factor that limited the performance of the system. However, the unshielded cable can sometimes be susceptible to high levels of noise.

Like a floppy drive interface, ST-506 moves the drive head one track at a time with a timed pulse, which cannot occur faster than the stepper motor can move the head. The ST-412 disk drive, among other improvements, added &quot;buffered seek&quot; capability to the interface. The controller sends the required STEP pulses to the drive as fast as it can receive them. The ST506 disk drive without buffered seek averages 170 ms (similar to a floppy drive or modern optical drive) while the mechanically very similar ST-412 disk drive with buffered seek averages 85 ms. By the late 1980s, drives with an ST-412 interface were capable of average seek times between 15 and 30 milliseconds.

The process of moving portions of the command interpretation off the controller card and onto the drive itself in order to improve performance is a common feature of later hard drive connection schemes, notably SCSI, with its rich command set, and the storage-focused IDE systems. IDE, in effect, is a system for extending the computer bus so the interface controller can be built into the drive unit rather than being plugged into the computer&#x27;s backplane. This allows a single &quot;controller&quot; card—really just an interface card—to communicate with multiple dissimilar drives, while it also reduces latency and noise between the controller and drive hardware. Effectively, the roles are reversed: instead of the controller doing almost all of the complex processing and the drive just transferring encoded data between the magnetic disks and the controller, the drive does almost all of the complex processing and the &quot;controller&quot; just transfers decoded data between the drive and the host system. In these systems, the operational details of the drive, like head selection and seeking, are entirely hidden from the host and handled within the drive&#x27;s dedicated controller. These became known as &quot;smart&quot; drives, while ST-506–like devices retroactively became known as &quot;dumb&quot;.

While integrated controllers have many benefits, they also have a disadvantage: the mechanical drive (called the &quot;head-disk assembly&quot;, or HDA) and the controller are effectively fused into a monolithic black box, so that if something goes wrong with the drive, it is nearly impossible to do anything about it—the data is usually irretrievably lost. With a separated controller and disk system like that of the ST-506 interface, sometimes the problem can be resolved by connecting the disk drive, containing the actual (perhaps very important) data, to another compatible controller. Furthermore, an ST-506 style interface makes it possible and easy not only to replace the controller without throwing away the data, but to get access to the analog data signals from the disk drive and process them through a special data recovery system that may be able to reconstruct data that a normal controller cannot read. Such data recovery techniques are much more difficult to execute on integrated drives, because the needed analog signals from the disk are not available at a standard interface and the internal data recording method, sector format, and disk organization of nearly every integrated drive model is different and secret.

== Compatible systems and developments ==

Many other companies quickly introduced drives using the same connectors and signals, creating a hard drive standard based on the ST-506. IBM chose to use it, acquiring adapter cards for the PC/XT from Xebec and for the PC/AT from Western Digital. As a consequence of IBM&#x27;s endorsement, most of the drives in the 1980s were based on the ST-506. However, the complexity of the controller and cabling led to newer solutions like SCSI, and later, ATA (IDE). A few early SCSI drives were actually ST-506 drives with a SCSI to ST-506 controller on the bottom of the drive. Atari also used Adaptec ACB-4000A SCSI to ST-506 converter inside its own line of SH204/SH205 external ACSI drives. Likewise a few early IDE drives were just drives with an ST-412 interface attached to a controller board or chip. Ultimately all SCSI and ATA drives had built the controller into the drive, thereby eliminating the ST-506/412 interface in such models.
