<text>Bernardsville () is the northernmost borough in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Situated within the heart of the Raritan Valley and Somerset Hills regions, the borough is an historic and wealthy bedroom community of New York City in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,893, an increase of 186 (+2.4%) from the 2010 census count of 7,707, which in turn had reflected an increase of 362 (+4.9%) from the 7,345 counted at the 2000 census. Bernardsville is often mispronounced as &quot;Ber-NARDS-ville&quot; as opposed to the correct pronunciation, &quot;BER-nards-ville&quot;.

Bernardsville was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 6, 1924, from portions of Bernards Township, based on the results of a referendum held on April 29, 1924. The borough was named for Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet, who served as governor of the Province of New Jersey before the Revolutionary War. In 2009, part of the borough was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Olcott Avenue Historic District.

In 2000, Bernardsville had the 10th-highest per capita income in New Jersey. Based on data from the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, the borough had a per-capita income of $70,141, ranked 27th in the state. In 2019, the borough was ranked by &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; as 64th of 100 on its 2019 list of Bloomberg Richest Places, one of 18 in the state included on the list.

==History==
Bernardsville was originally a section of Bernards Township known as Vealtown. In 1840, Vealtown became Bernardsville, named after Sir Francis Bernard, Colonial governor of New Jersey from 1758 to 1760. Located in the northernmost part of Somerset County, just south of Morristown, the borough includes some of the last vestiges of the Great Eastern Forest.

During the Revolutionary War, General Charles Lee rested his troops in Vealtown around the night of December 12 to 13, 1776. General Lee and some of his guard spent the night about southeast at White&#x27;s Inn on the southeast side of Basking Ridge, near the manor house of Continental Army general William Alexander, Lord Stirling. On the morning of December 13, General Lee was captured by the British and removed to New York. The Vealtown Tavern, now known as the John Parker Tavern, was a regular stop during the 1779–1780 winter encampment at Morristown.

After the Civil War, many wealthy and prominent New Yorkers moved into the area, first as summer visitors, then later as permanent residents of the Bernardsville Mountain. For most, the men worked in New York City while the women and children spent summers in Bernardsville. The Gladstone Branch of the existing railroad line was built through Bernardsville in 1872 and played an important role in the borough&#x27;s development. The Gladstone line, whose five o&#x27;clock train was appropriately nicknamed &quot;the millionaire&#x27;s special,&quot; as it was direct route to Penn Station, allowed the men who built grand estates in Bernardsville to commute to the city on a daily basis rather than only visit their families on weekends. Bernardsville did not become an independent municipality until 1924, when it split from Bernards Township.

On November 4, 2020, The Bernardsville Library announced that it would join the MAIN Library System, which has member libraries in all of Morris County, all of Hunterdon County and parts of Somerset and Warren counties. The Bernardsville Library is the second library from Somerset County to join the MAIN System, after the Bernards Township Library in neighboring Bernards Township. The library joined the MAIN System on January 11, 2021

On January 15, 2021, Kings Food Markets announced that it would close their Bernardsville location on Morristown Road, officially closing on January 23, 2021.

===Historic district===
The New Jersey State Review Board for Historic Sites recommended the creation of the Olcott Avenue historic district on February 10, 2009. While the Olcott Avenue School is but one historic structure within Bernardsville&#x27;s first historic district area, the area&#x27;s appeal and historic significance is part of the story of the rise of the middle class in Bernardsville and how this particular location impacted the entire region, from the downtown, Little Italy, and the Mountain Colony areas.
The Olcott Avenue Historic District is a historic district located along portions of Olcott, Childsworth, and Highview Avenues, and Church Street that recognizes a neighborhood developed in the early 20th century. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 2009, for its significance in architecture, community planning and development, and education.

According to the National Park Service:

The Olcott Avenue neighborhood in the borough of Bernardsville, located in northeast Somerset County, was developed at the turn of the 20th century as a carefully laid out middle class residential neighborhood. The streets in the district are characterized by lots of moderate size with regular setbacks with moderate to substantial dwellings constructed in a variety of late 19th and early 20th century architectural styles, several of which are particularly noteworthy examples. The original dwellings constructed during the first three decades or so of the 20th century all still stand and the streetscape has changed relatively little since curbs and sidewalks were added and the road was paved around 1916. Residents of the district have continued the long tradition of participation in civic activities.
Olcott Avenue is named after Frederic P. Olcott, a New York banker, politician, and philanthropist, who lived here. The street was originally named after Stewart Wolfe. In 1905, Olcott financed the construction of a high school, the first in the township, and donated it to the Bernards Township Board of Education. The stone building features Tudor Revival style and was designed by architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, who also lived here. Hardenbergh also designed the Bernardsville United Methodist Church and the parish house at St. Bernard&#x27;s Church. The district includes several houses designed with Colonial Revival style.

<doc id="125708" wikidata="Q895149" url="?curid=125708" title="Bound Brook, New Jersey">
<text>Bound Brook is a borough in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located along the Raritan River. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 11,988, an increase of 1,586 (+15.2%) from the 2010 census count of 10,402, which in turn reflected an increase of 247 (+2.4%) from the 10,155 counted in the 2000 census, .

Bound Brook was originally incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 24, 1869, within portions of Bridgewater Township. On February 11, 1891, it was reincorporated as a borough, based on the results of a referendum held on the previous day.

==History==
The area was first settled in 1681 and a community was established near the Bound Brook stream of the same name, which flows into the Raritan River via the Green Brook on the eastern side of the borough. The brook, which was mentioned as a boundary in a Native American deed, provides the source of the borough&#x27;s name.

A wooden bridge over the Raritan River was erected as early as 1761 and named Queen&#x27;s Bridge in 1767. Later, it became a covered bridge. During the American Revolutionary War, the bridge was used repeatedly by both sides including during the Battle of Bound Brook in 1777. In 1875, the wooden bridge was replaced by a steel pipe truss bridge. More than 100 years later, that bridge was itself replaced by a steel girder bridge in 1984, still using the old pillars. The bridge was renovated and repaved in 2007.

The Battle of Bound Brook, one of the battles in the New York and New Jersey campaign during the American Revolutionary War, occurred on April 13, 1777, and resulted in a defeat for the Continental Army, who were routed by about 4,000 troops under British command.

On April 22, 1921, over 100 people were injured in Bound Brook, and one died, when a cloud of phosgene gas began spreading over the city in the early morning hours, the result of a faulty valve of a storage tank at a paint factory in town. The intervention of four people stopped further escape of the phosgene, which had been used in concentrated form as a chemical weapon during World War I.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.70 square miles (4.39 km2), including 1.66 square miles (4.30 km2) of land and 0.03 square miles (0.09 km2) of water (2.00%).

The borough borders the municipalities of Bridgewater Township and South Bound Brook in Somerset County; and Middlesex Borough in Middlesex County.

Since the southern portion of the borough (including the downtown area) is a low-lying natural flood plain of the Raritan River, Bound Brook has suffered occasional severe flooding after heavy rain. Extensive flood control measures were put into place during 1999–2015 to provide protection from 150-year floods.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===

==Natural disasters==
The lower downtown area of Bound Brook has been associated with flooding of the Raritan River. In September 1999, many structures near the commercial zone were damaged or destroyed by record Raritan floods resulting from Hurricane Floyd. This disaster reinvigorated a long-planned effort called the Green Brook Flood Control Project that would protect Bound Brook from up to a 150-year flooding event from the Raritan River and its tributaries, the Middle Brook and Green Brook that form the western and eastern boundaries of the town. During 1999–2015, the United States Army Corps of Engineers implemented extensive flood control measures to provide protection from future floods, which eliminated flood insurance requirements for a majority of Bound Brook and spurred revitalization of the downtown area. 

The highest flooding level since 1800 in Bound Brook was reached during Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 – , according to the United States Geological Survey—nearly matched by Tropical Storm Doria in August 1971, the April 2007 nor&#x27;easter and Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Main Street was also flooded in July 1938, September 1938, August 1955, August 1973, October 1996, and March 2010.

Bound Brook&#x27;s downtown flooding led to several out-of-control fires over its history, including the fires of 1881 and 1887, which led to the formation of the Bound Brook Fire Department. In 1896, flooding likely caused the lime in the L.D. Cook lumberyard to ignite and the resulting fire spread to and destroyed the Presbyterian church. During Hurricane Floyd in 1999, a fire began in Otto Williams Harley Davidson on Main Street. With the building cut off by flood water, the fire spread quickly to two other structures before the Bound Brook Fire Department could contain it, then under the command of Chief Richard S. Colombaroni. Using fire boats from the New York City Fire Department as well as extensive help from mutual aid companies, the fire was stopped before two other buildings on Main Street and others nearby on Mountain Avenue, could be affected.

During the April 2007 Nor&#x27;easter, the Bound Brook Fire Department stopped another fire from spreading through an area of close residential construction. Under the command of Chief James Knight, and again with the assistance of mutual aid companies including the Finderne Fire Department, fire loss was restricted to three residential buildings.

On January 12, 2020, a non flood-related, seven-alarm fire set by an arsonist ripped through commercial buildings in the downtown area, causing $52 million in damages.

<text>Branchburg is a township in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 14,940, its highest decennial census count ever and an increase of 481 (+3.3%) from the 2010 census count of 14,459, which in turn had reflected a decline of 107 (−0.7%) from the 14,566 counted at the 2000 census.

== History ==
While the area of today&#x27;s Branchburg has a history antedating the American Revolutionary War, the township itself was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 5, 1845, from portions of Bridgewater Township. The township is named for its location at a point where branches of the Raritan River merge.

The land that is now known as Branchburg Township was originally inhabited by the Raritans, a tribe of the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. By 1686 most of the land was purchased from the Lenape by the Lords Proprietors of East Jersey, who sold the land in small parcels to numerous settlers, mostly of Dutch or English extraction. With the 1688 redrawing of the boundary between East and West Jersey, the Branchburg region was split between Essex County to the north and the newly formed Somerset County to the south. With Somerset&#x27;s acquisition of territory from Essex and Middlesex Counties in 1741, Branchburg lay entirely within Somerset County.

Bridgewater Township was chartered in 1749. The residents of the part of Bridgewater west of the Raritan River petitioned the New Jersey Legislature for incorporation as a separate township, which was granted by an act dated April 5, 1845. The first town meeting was held April 14, 1845, in White Oak Tavern, a stagecoach stop and local meeting place along the Old York Road.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 20.30 square miles (52.58 km2), including 20.07 square miles (51.98 km2) of land and 0.23 square miles (0.6 km2) of water (1.14%).

The township is long and approximately across at its widest point. Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Burnt Mill, Centerville, Fox Hollow, Neshanic, Neshanic Station (ZIP Code 08853) and North Branch (ZIP Code 08876), North Branch Depot and Woodfern.

The township is bordered on the west by Readington Township in Hunterdon County; on the north by Bedminster Township and on the south by Bridgewater Township and Hillsborough Township.

The main watercourses are the Lamington River on the north, the North Branch of the Raritan River on the east and the South Branch of the Raritan River on the east and south. These rivers along with small streams and brooks are excellent for fishermen who enjoy trout stocked streams and rivers. Branchburg is in the Raritan Valley, a line of cities in Central New Jersey. Branchburg lies in the western division of the Raritan Valley along with Bridgewater and Raritan.

<doc id="125710" wikidata="Q367285" url="?curid=125710" title="Bridgewater Township, New Jersey">
<text>Bridgewater Township is a township in Somerset County in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located within the heart of the Raritan Valley region. Situated within Central New Jersey and crisscrossed by several major highways, the township is known for being both the regional commercial hub for Somerset County (home to Bridgewater Commons and different corporate headquarters) and as a suburban bedroom community of New York City within the New York metropolitan area. The township is located roughly away from Manhattan and about away from Staten Island.

Bridgewater Township was created by Royal charter on April 4, 1749, from portions of the Northern precinct. It was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships by the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, under the Township Act of 1798. During the nineteenth century, portions of the township were taken to form Warren Township (March 5, 1806), Branchburg Township (April 5, 1845), Somerville (March 25, 1863), Raritan (April 3, 1868) and Bound Brook (March 24, 1869).

As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 45,977, an increase of 1,513 (+3.4%) from the 2010 census count of 44,464, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,524 (+3.5%) from the 42,940 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==

Bridgewater is a relatively large, suburban township located in the center of Somerset County. The area of the present Township of Bridgewater was originally purchased from a local Lenape Native American tribe. Bridgewater was chartered by George II of Great Britain in 1749 and incorporated on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey&#x27;s 104 original townships. It is named after the town of Bridgwater in the English county of Somerset.

Tradition holds that it was at the Middlebrook encampment the first official flag of the United States was unfurled, after law to adopt a national flag had been passed by Congress on June 14, 1777. By special order of Congress, a Thirteen Star Flag is flown 24 hours a day at the Washington Camp Ground, part of the former Middlebrook encampment, in Bridgewater. Since 1889, the first hoisting of the flag is commemorated annually each July 4 with a changing of the flag, a reading of the Declaration of Independence and the delivery of a historical address.

Until the 1960s, Bridgewater was largely known as a farming community. In the 1970s its population began to grow when residents of larger cities such as Plainfield and Newark started to migrate into Bridgewater as a result of the 1967 Plainfield Riots and 1967 Newark riots. Subsequently, Bridgewater started to receive an influx of residents who worked in the strong pharmaceutical, telecommunications and financial industries in Bridgewater and the Raritan Valley. More recently, there has also been growth as Bridgewater has become more popular with New York City commuters who use the Bridgewater Station on New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Raritan Valley Line or Interstate 78 East to commute to New York City. Bridgewater is now a fairly developed suburban community, with only a few traces of its rural past still evident in the town (particularly in its northwestern section). Bridgewater is now Somerset County&#x27;s second-most populous municipality, after Franklin Township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 32.36 square miles (83.81 km2), including 31.89 square miles (82.59 km2) of land and 0.47 square miles (1.23 km2) of water (1.46%).

While much of Bridgewater has a relatively flat terrain, the northeastern portion of the township is very hilly, with the First Ridge of the Watchung Mountains (sometimes known as the First Watchung Mountain) passing through the township. Additionally, the Second Ridge (Second Mountain) passes north of the township border.

The Raritan River and its branches and tributaries form much of Bridgewater&#x27;s borders with other municipalities and a number of smaller rivers and streams run through Bridgewater. The Raritan itself runs along Bridgewater&#x27;s southern border (except where Somerville and Raritan were carved out as separate boroughs) and the North Branch of the Raritan River forms the township&#x27;s western border with Branchburg. The North Branch and South Branch of the Raritan River meet at the extreme southwestern corner of Bridgewater at the border with both Branchburg Township and Hillsborough Township; this point, known as the Raritan River Confluence, was once intended to be a major reservoir.

Bradley Gardens (with a 2010 Census population of 14,206), Bridgewater Center,
Finderne (5,600), 
Green Knoll (6,200), and 
Martinsville (11,980) are census-designated places and unincorporated communities located within Bridgewater Township. Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Chimney Rock, Hobbstown, Middle Brook Heights, Milltown, and Sunset Lake.

Bridgewater borders 13 other municipalities. Its longest borders are with Branchburg Township, Bedminster Township, Bernards Township, Warren Township, Bound Brook, Somerville, and Raritan. It also borders Green Brook (though connected only by Route 22), Middlesex (though connected only by one local street), South Bound Brook (a very short border in the middle of the Raritan River), Franklin Township (the only street connection is Interstate 287), Manville (the only street connection is Finderne Avenue, a county highway), and Hillsborough Township (no direct street connection).

Bridgewater Township&#x27;s ZIP Code is 08807, with 08836 used in the community of Martinsville, and 08805 used in the Thomae Park section (mailing address of Bound Brook). Bridgewater&#x27;s area codes are 908 and 732/848. Bridgewater is in Raritan Valley (a line of cities in Central New Jersey). Bridgewater lies in the western division of the Raritan Valley along with Branchburg and Raritan.

===Communities===

*North Branch (eastern portion): Most of North Branch is in Branchburg, but a portion lies to the east of the North Branch of the Raritan River, in Bridgewater Township.
*Finderne: Located in southeastern Bridgewater between Bound Brook and Somerville. This is a diverse area with older neighborhoods bordering Foothill Road, newer developments, multi-unit housing near the Raritan River/Manville border, as well as commercial and industrial areas. The Middlebrook Crossing industrial park, the Promenade shopping center and TD Bank Ballpark, home to the Somerset Patriots, are located here.
*Green Knoll: Located in central Bridgewater, this is a residential area with many major commercial developments and government facilities, including the Bridgewater Commons Mall at the intersection of U.S. Route 22 and U.S. Route 202-206, a large office park west of the Commons across 202–206, the municipal building and police station and Bridgewater-Raritan High School.
*Country Club/Meadow Road Area: This area is referred to by some as the &quot;Country Club-Meadow Road area&quot; or similar names, after the major north–south streets there. Some also refer to it as &quot;the Van Holten area&quot; after the elementary school located there. It borders Bedminster and Branchburg.
*Milltown/Vanderveer Road Area: This area is northeast of Bradley Gardens bordering Raritan and Branchburg. It is mainly a residential community with many new homes. 
*Martinsville: Located in northeastern Bridgewater near Warren Township and Bernards Township. This is an affluent, predominantly residential area, though it does have its own commercial center along Washington Valley Road and its own post office and ZIP Code. This also is a very hilly area; it is the portion of Bridgewater through which the Watchung Mountains pass.
*Sunset Lake: Built around a man-made lake in the extreme northern part of Bridgewater, near the interchange of Interstate 287 and Interstate 78. Some of its residents have the Basking Ridge ZIP Code 07920.

===Popular culture===
* Bridgewater is the setting for a concept album by the band The World/Inferno Friendship Society. Titled &quot;The True Story of the Bridgewater Astral League&quot;, the album talks about a gang of young people who like to get together and create all sorts of mischief.
* It was one of the filming locations for the Columbia Pictures 1994 comedy film &quot;North&quot;, which used the Bridgewater Commons Mall as the setting for a discussion between characters.

===Superfund cleanup site===
In August 2011, Hurricane Irene submerged the former American Cyanamid Superfund site, causing chemicals to leak into the nearby Raritan River. It could cost Pfizer up to $205 million and take a decade to clean up nearly all of the contaminated American Cyanamid site in Bridgewater—of which are in the township and are in Bound Brook—according to a company study awaiting federal approval.

===Mosque settlement===
In early 2011, the application was made to turn the Redwood Inn, a former inn/reception center, into the township&#x27;s first mosque. The township council passed an ordinance that required houses of worship, country clubs, and other such businesses only be built on locations with access to major roads, which would directly impact the application by the mosque. The planning board immediately dismissed the application, averting state statute that would become effective on May 5 that would have made rejection much more difficult. The applicant, Al Falah Center, then filed a lawsuit against the township.

In December 2014, the case was settled out of court, with the township agreeing to purchase a lot between Routes 202–206 and Route 287 for $2.75 million and give it to the organization to build a mosque, as well as provide $5 million paid by its insurer for reimbursement for legal fees and alleged damages. In return, the case was dropped and the township was given ownership of the original Mountaintop Road property, with the zoning ordinance law left intact.

<text>Franklin Township is a township in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is centrally located in the Raritan Valley region within the New York Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 68,364, an increase of 6,064 (+9.7%) from the 2010 census count of 62,300, which in turn reflected an increase of 11,397 (+22.4%) from the 50,903 counted in the 2000 census. The township was the state&#x27;s 19th most-populous municipality in 2020, after being ranked 22nd in 2010.

Traditionally a farming community, it has become a fast-growing suburb with massive development in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, fostering a diverse blend of races, religions, and cultures. In 2008, Franklin Township ranked #5 on &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of America&#x27;s Top 100 Best Places to Live.

What is now Franklin Township was originally formed circa 1745 as Eastern precinct. Franklin Township was incorporated on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature. Portions of the township were taken to form South Bound Brook (formed within Township, became an independent municipality as of April 11, 1907) and East Millstone (formed on February 18, 1873, and returned to Franklin Township on December 31, 1949).

== History ==
It has been unclear if the township was named for founding father Benjamin Franklin or for his illegitimate son William Franklin, a Loyalist and the last Royal Governor of New Jersey (from 1763 to 1776). In 2000, after considering the evidence set forth by William B. Brahms in his books &quot;Images of America: Franklin Township&quot; (1997) and &quot;Franklin Township, Somerset County, NJ: A History&quot;, and &quot;The Case for William Franklin and The Case for Benjamin Franklin&quot;, the Township Council chose the theory that the township was indeed named for Benjamin Franklin.

Franklin Township was very much a part of Revolutionary War history and the scene of many raiding parties along Route 27, then known as the King&#x27;s Highway. Two British generals, Cornwallis and DeHeister, tried to lure General George Washington and his Continental Army into battle on the plains of Middlebush and East Millstone. Washington, however, kept his troops at Chimney Rock, just north of Franklin, until the British withdrew. Several of the prosperous Middlebush farms were destroyed by the British soldiers during their retreat. In 1777, near the mill on the Millstone River at Weston, the Continental Army and local militia engaged and successfully drove off a British foraging party of about 600 troops, sent out of New Brunswick by General Cornwallis. On November 2, 1783, Washington composed his farewell address to the army while staying at Rockingham near Rocky Hill.

The construction of the Delaware and Raritan Canal in the 1830s, stretching to connect New York City and Philadelphia, led to significant growth in the township, with as much as 200,000 tons of goods shipped on barges using the canal by the 1860s. The rise of shipping commercial goods using railroads led to a substantial decline in canal traffic. The area has been restored as the Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park

The Van Wickle House, located next to the Delaware and Raritan Canal in the Somerset section of the township, in between New Brunswick and South Bound Brook, was built in 1722 by Dutch settlers and is now owned by Franklin Township and leased by the Meadows Foundation. Set back behind Easton Avenue, the home adjoins the Rutgers Preparatory School and a Revolutionary War-era graveyard.

Passenger and freight railroad service was available in Franklin Township during the later half of the 19th century via the Millstone and New Brunswick Railroad (M&amp;NB) which opened in 1854. The railroad was built and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), from a junction with the PRR mainline at Jersey Avenue in New Brunswick to East Millstone. The M&amp;NB is now known as the Conrail Millstone Secondary Branch. The branch line was still operated by Conrail up to just west of Clyde Road in Somerset for a time, serving local industry in the industrial section of Somerset. As of 2011, Hermann Warehouse Corp re-located out of the Clyde Road facility and there has not been rail service into that building since then. A bumper was placed east of the Somerset Road/Route 27 crossing, with Clyde Road, Veronica Avenue and Route 27 crossings currently out of service. Jersey Avenue/Route 91 remains the sole active crossing on the line.

In 1922, the infamous Hall-Mills Murder took place in Franklin Township, in the area adjacent to New Brunswick known as Somerset.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 46.88 square miles (121.43 km2), including 46.17 square miles (119.58 km2) of land and 0.71 square miles (1.85 km2) of water (1.52%).

The community is approximately 75% rural.

The township borders the municipalities of Bridgewater Township, Hillsborough Township, Manville, Millstone, Montgomery Township, Rocky Hill and South Bound Brook in Somerset County; Princeton in Mercer County; New Brunswick, North Brunswick, Piscataway and South Brunswick in Middlesex County.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===
The Township of Franklin is chartered under the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, within the Council-Manager, Plan D. The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The Township Council is comprised of nine members, including one from each of the five wards, three elected from the township at-large, and the mayor. The mayor is the Chief Legislative Officer of the township and is directly elected from the township at-large to serve a four-year term. The Township Manager is the chief executive officer overseeing the township&#x27;s daily operations and is hired by and serves at the pleasure of the Township Council. Councilmembers are chosen for a four-year term in partisan elections held at the June Primary and November General Elections in odd-numbered years, with the five ward seats coming up for election together and the mayoral and at-large seats up for election two years later.

, the Mayor of Franklin Township is Democrat Phillip Kramer, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Township Council are Deputy Mayor Crystal Pruitt (D; At-Large, 2023), Sivaraman Anbarasan (D; At-Large, 2023), Kimberly Francois (D; At-Large, 2023), Charles Onyejiaka (D; 3rd Ward, 2025), Ed Potosnak (D; 1st Ward, 2025), Shepa Uddin (D; 2nd Ward, 2025), James Vassanella (D; 5th Ward, 2025) and Carl R.A. Wright (D; 4th Ward, 2025).

In the November 2015 general election, Phillip Kramer became the first Democrat directly elected as mayor in the township&#x27;s history, resulting in the mayor and entire council being from the Democratic Party. This marked a transition that started in 1995, when the council was controlled 8 to 1 by the Republican Party. In January 2016, the Township Council selected Charles Onyejiaka from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the Third Ward seat expiring in December 2017 that was vacated by Philip Kramer when he took office as mayor; Onyejiaka will serve on an interim basis until the November 2016 general election, when voters will select a candidate to fill the one-year balance of the term of office.

In January 2015, the Township Council chose Chris Kelly from among three candidates offered by the Republican municipal committee to fill the vacant seat of Brian D. Levine, who had resigned from his council seat to take office on the Somerset County Board of Chosen Freeholders.

In 1998, the township approved a referendum by a better than 2–1 margin to raise property taxes by 3 cents per $100 of assessed valuation, with the money to be used to preserve open space.

<text>Green Brook Township is a township in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is centrally located within the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 7,281, an increase of 78 (+1.1%) from the 2010 census count of 7,203, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,549 (+27.4%) from the 5,654 counted in the 2000 census.

What is now Green Brook was originally created as North Plainfield Township on April 2, 1872, from portions of Warren Township. Portions of the township were taken to form North Plainfield (June 9, 1885) and Watchung (March 23, 1926). Green Brook was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 8, 1932, replacing North Plainfield Township, based on the results of a referendum held that same day.

Green Brook describes itself as &quot;Small Enough to Know You, Large Enough to Get Things Done&quot;. Most of Green Brook shares ZIP Code 08812 with Dunellen.

== History ==
In 1872, a tract of land was subdivided off from Warren Township. Thirteen years later, in 1885, the Borough of North Plainfield was created from a section of the subdivided land. The land at that time was designated as North Plainfield. In 1926, the Borough of Watchung was carved out of North Plainfield Township. The municipality&#x27;s name was changed to Green Brook Township in 1932.

Green Brook Township takes its name from the waterway that passes through the township called the Green Brook that rises in the Watchung Mountains several miles away, feeding from many smaller brooks and ponds along the way, as it flows in a southwesterly direction for a distance of . It then continues southwestward and flows into the Raritan River at Bound Brook, which provides access to the New York City area and the Atlantic Ocean. The brook was named for the color of its water.

Also contained within the township is Washington Rock State Park, which commemorates the spot where George Washington and Marquis de Lafayette watched the movement of the British soldiers during the American Revolutionary War, mainly the months of May and June 1777. The park was established on March 17, 1913, and is about in size.

<text>Hillsborough Township is a township in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located in the Raritan Valley region, the township is a suburban and exurban bedroom community of New York City within the New York Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 43,276, an increase of 4,973 (+13.0%) from the 2010 census count of 38,303, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,669 (+4.6%) from the 36,634 counted in the 2000 census.

Hillsborough Township was originally created by royal charter issued May 31, 1771, which was revoked and revised on September 12, 1771. It was incorporated on February 21, 1798 by the New Jersey Legislature Township Act of 1798 as one of New Jersey&#x27;s original group of 104 townships. Portions of the township were taken to form the boroughs of Millstone (May 14, 1894) and Manville (April 1, 1929). The township&#x27;s name may have come from an earlier name of &quot;Hillsbury&quot;, though it may have been named for Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire who was the Earl of Hillsborough. Based on an analysis of data from the FBI&#x27;s Uniform Crime Report for 2022, Hillsborough Township was ranked as the second-safest small city in the United States.

==History==
On May 31, 1771, Hillsborough was officially granted a Charter incorporating it as a Township. A revised charter was issued on September 12, 1771. The records of Hillsborough Township are complete from their inception in 1746 and there are ten volumes, each some several hundred pages, kept in the Special Collections Department of the Rutgers University Library along with the Charter.

Hillsborough Township quickly took its place in history as the path General George Washington and his troops traveled from the Battle of Princeton to winter quarters in Morristown. While the British were encamped in the valley below awaiting an opportunity to attack, it is said that Washington drilled his troops on the Sourland Mountain around a spring near the top using different formations and corn stalks for guns. As the sun caught the stalks, the British thought Washington had received reinforcements and fresh supplies. The British troops, thinking that they were outnumbered, slipped off to New Brunswick leaving Washington to continue to Morristown.

The township was formally incorporated on February 21, 1798.

Hillsborough is the home of the Belle Mead GSA depot, or Belle Mead General Depot, which was a storage site for materials during World War II, along with housing Italian and German prisoners of war. It continued storing materials until the 1980s, and various contaminants have leaked into the ground and surrounding area during that time. Efforts are under way to convert the site into a mixed recreation and R&amp;D complex.

Hillsborough is home to Duke Gardens and Duke Farms, a estate in the north-eastern quadrant of the town that was originally owned by tobacco and electric energy tycoon James &quot;Buck&quot; Duke and then passed down to daughter Doris Duke. As of March 2023, approximately one-third of Hillsborough Township is preserved as Open Space and/or Preserved Farmland. 

In &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2013 Best Places to Live rankings, Hillsborough was ranked 16th in the nation, the third-highest among the three places in New Jersey included in the top 50 list.

The DFF over the years have created new indoor and outdoor display gardens that are eco-friendly, use native plants, and are wheelchair accessible. In the process of rehabilitation numerous invasive foreign plants were removed including Norwegian maple and Asian Ailanthus and replaced by native species. On May 19, 2012, Duke Farms opened to the public. After a $45-million renovation, Duke Farms now include 30 endangered species and 230 varieties of birds, among which are the great blue heron and the bald eagle.

==Government==
===Local government===
Hillsborough Township is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. The mayor and deputy mayor are chosen by the Township Committee from among its members at an annual reorganization meeting, each serving a one-year term.

, members of the Hillsborough Township Committee are Mayor Robert Britting Jr. (R, term on committee and term as mayor end December 31, 2024), Deputy Mayor John Ciccarelli (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2025; term as deputy mayor ends 2024), Shawn Lipani (R, 2024), Samantha Hand (D, 2026), and Catherine Payne (R, 2026).

James Ruh was appointed in December 2022 to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that became vacant following the resignation of Janine Erickson a month earlier.

In March 2022, the Township Committee selected Robert Britting Jr. from a list of three names nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2024 that had been held by Steven Cohen until he stepped down from office due to COVID-19-related health issues. Britting served on an interim basis until the November 2022 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.

In March 2021, the Township Committee chose Democrat Jeffrey Wright from three candidates listed by the local Democratic committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held by Olivia Holmes, who had resigned the previous month due to COVID related issues.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
, the township had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Somerset County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

U.S. Route 206 is the main road that passes through the township. Construction of a new alignment of US 206, the US 206 Bypass began in 2010 to bypass the congested stretch of the road. Built in two phases, the first phase, between Hillsborough and Amwell Roads, was opened in October 2013. The second phase was originally expected to be completed by 2015, but was delayed multiple times due to a lack of state funding. Construction finally resumed in 2017 and the roadway was completed in 2021. The road is named for Peter J. Biondi, a former Hillsborough mayor and member of the General Assembly.

Now that construction of the Bypass is completed, the intention is for the existing US-206 to become a downtown &quot;main street&quot; for the township and be zoned for commercial and residential use.

Main county roads that pass through are CR 514 which runs for through the township, and CR 533. Interstate 287 is outside the municipality in bordering Bridgewater and Franklin Townships. Part of the proposed routing of Interstate 95 through central New Jersey included Hillsborough; this project was ultimately canceled in the 1980s.

===Rail===
NJ Transit has proposed a new West Trenton Line that would stretch for from the West Trenton station in Ewing Township to a connection with the Raritan Valley Line at Bridgewater Township, and from there to Newark Penn Station in Newark. The plan would include stations at both Belle Mead and Hillsborough. The plan was canceled due to lack of funding and NJ Transit has no plans to restore the project.

The Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Lehigh Line (formerly the mainline of the Lehigh Valley Railroad), runs through Hillsborough Township.

===Bus===
Hillsborough is served by SCOOT buses, providing service to Manville, Bridgewater Township and Somerville, with service continuing to Bedminster during rush hour.

Coach USA offers weekday express service across 42nd Street to the United Nations in Midtown Manhattan from Hillsborough operated by Suburban Transit. There are four morning buses Monday through Friday with a reduced schedule on some Holidays.

==Flooding problems==

Manville suffers from occasional flooding events that occur after prolonged heavy rainfall events, when the Raritan River and Millstone River overflow their banks into the northern section (Raritan) and the Lost Valley section (Millstone) of the borough. The southern parts of Main Street also suffer from the flooding, due to the presence of Royce Brook which backs up with water from the nearby Millstone River in which it empties.

There are studies being undertaken to address the flooding problems in the Millstone River basin and Manville; however, none of the flood control ideas in the Millstone River basin have gotten beyond the initial study stages as of late 2006.

===Hurricane Floyd flood of 1999===
Manville was severely hit by a flood in the wake of Hurricane Floyd in September 1999, which dropped of rain in the areas surrounding the borough. The floods devastated the Lost Valley section, some of the South side area along Main Street and a large portion of the North side. Water levels reached between and in parts of the borough on September 17, 1999. The only way residents could get help was by boat or helicopter. There was also a large amount of fuel oil floating on the flood water which further damaged homes, many of which came off their foundations.

A portion of the north side received water coming from the Raritan at Dukes Parkway. Much of the north side had no flooding, though the significant flooding of the northside was concentrated from Dukes Parkway to Louis Street and Main Street to 3rd Avenue. The water reached the freight tracks at Main Street, and spilled over, flooding some on the South Street side, but leaving tons of water dammed in on the North Street side, where people had to be rescued from rooftops, or second floor windows and landings, by boat.

The problem was doubled in the Lost Valley section, as flood waters backed up where the Raritan and Millstone rivers meet near the dam. All trapped and injured people had to be taken out by helicopter, as there was no way to get in or out of the Lost Valley section. The September 1999 flood disaster was the worst ever to hit Manville, although it had been flooded in 1971 during Tropical Storm Doria, when many of the Lost Valley houses were destroyed and their foundations lost, and previously before that in the 1950s. Because of the railroad tracks being so much higher than the Lost Valley land, Manville&#x27;s Lost Valley will always be a number one target for flooding. Through research of Manville&#x27;s history, Lost Valley was to remain open land due to the high risk of flood.

===Lost Valley flooding===
Manville is where the Raritan River and the tributary Millstone River join together, in the far northeastern corner of the borough. The Lost Valley section in eastern Manville is situated on the natural flood plain between the Raritan and Millstone Rivers and bears the brunt of occasional flooding events which affect the river basins. The Lost Valley section is named so because it is generally disconnected from the rest of the borough with only a tunnel at Kyle Street and a bridge at Bridge Street crossing the railroad tracks to the neighborhood. Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 produced a particularly severe flood (a record for the river basins) in Manville, especially in the Lost Valley section of the borough, which experienced flooding all the way to the railroad tracks, with twelve feet or more water on many properties, which inundated houses with damaging flood waters. Another severe and devastating flood event occurred in Lost Valley during the April 2007 Nor&#x27;easter. It also left many homes and businesses underwater and was the worst flood since Hurricane Floyd. Flooding problems once again occurred in Manville on March 14, 2010, with rivers running already high due to recent snow melt along with of rain that fell on the area on March 13, flooding was inevitable. More extensive flooding affected Manville in August 2011 when Hurricane Irene passed through New Jersey. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012, Manville did not flood but the powerful winds left many homes without power for several days.

=== Hurricane Ida floods ===
On September 1, 2021, the tropical remains of Hurricane Ida swept through Manville, causing floods in the majority of the town. The nearby Raritan river was flooded to a record , shattering the previous 27.1 feet recorded by Hurricane Floyd. On September 2, 2021, a house on Boesel Avenue exploded after the residents of the home had already evacuated, and nearby on North Second Avenue, another exploded and engulfed a home next to it, burning down as firefighters were unable to access the home due to the heavy floodwaters. That night, a local banquet hall, The Saffron, exploded and burned to the ground early Friday morning.

===Flood gauge on Raritan River===
Flooding occurs at a stage, and severe flooding occurs when the water reaches . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides access to real time river level data.

<text>Millstone is a borough in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough was originally known as Somerset Courthouse and was the county seat. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 448, an increase of 30 (+7.2%) from the 2010 census count of 418, which in turn reflected an increase of 8 (+2.0%) from the 410 counted in the 2000 census.

Millstone was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 14, 1894, from portions of Hillsborough Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The borough was reincorporated on March 12, 1928. The borough was named for the Millstone River (a major tributary of the Raritan River), whose name derives from an incident in which a millstone was dropped into it.

A historic district in Millstone, including 58 buildings, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The borough possesses a military significance for 1700–1749, 1750–1799, 1850–1874.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Millstone as its 7th best place to live in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

==History==

Millstone, then called Somerset Courthouse, was the county seat of Somerset County from 1738 until the British burned it to the ground in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War. After the victory at Princeton on January 3, 1777, General George Washington headquartered at the , while the army camped nearby that night. The next day, they marched to Pluckemin on the way to their winter encampment at Morristown.

Millstone was briefly connected to the Pennsylvania Railroad when the Mercer and Somerset Railway was extended to the town in the 1870s and connected via a bridge across the Millstone River to the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Millstone and New Brunswick Railroad, but that arrangement did not last into the 1880s. Remnants of the railroad bridge can still be seen.

The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Millstone is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie.

The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

<doc id="125717" wikidata="Q367289" url="?curid=125717" title="Montgomery Township, New Jersey">
<text>Montgomery Township is a township in southern Somerset County, in the central part of the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located in the New York Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 23,690, an increase of 1,436 (+6.5%) from the 2010 census count of 22,254, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,773 (+27.3%) from the 17,481 counted in the 2000 census.

Montgomery Township was incorporated on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature, from what remained of Western precinct. Portions of the township were taken to form Princeton Borough (February 11, 1813, in Mercer County, consolidated to form Princeton as of January 1, 2013), Princeton Township (April 9, 1838, also now consolidated into Princeton) and Rocky Hill (December 18, 1889).

The township has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Montgomery Township residents had a median household income of $180,660, ranked 2nd in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

== History ==
Before European settlement began, the area now known as Montgomery Township was inhabited for approximately 20,000 years by Lenni Lenape tribal groups. The current Native American population of Montgomery Township is just under 0.1% of the total population.

The first European landowners in what was to become Montgomery Township, such as Johannas Van Home and Peter Sonmans, were speculators who did not live on the land, but sold large parts of what they owned to companies that subdivided it into farm-sized plots for those who did intend to settle. Many speculators and early settlers were of Dutch descent from the New Amsterdam area (especially Long Island), which, after the British ousted the Dutch (1664), was renamed New York in honor of the Duke of York (the future James II). The Township was originally known as the Western Precinct of Somerset County (i.e. west of the Millstone River). Before the creation of Mercer County in 1838, the southern border extended to Nassau Street in Princeton. In 1798 the Western Precinct was organized as Montgomery Township, named for General Richard Montgomery, who fell fighting for the patriot cause in the Battle of Quebec at the start of the Revolution (1775).

Most of the land is flat and fertile, running westward from the Millstone River to Province Line, which divides Somerset from Hunterdon County and once marked the division between East and West Jersey. Farms of were common, some owners keeping a few slaves to work the land and serve in the household. The aim of the early settlers was to produce as many of the necessities of life as they could: subsistence farming, in other words. Each farm had a vegetable garden, orchard, pasturage and fields for grain, as well as a stand of timber to be selectively cut for fuel. What became known as the Harlingen Tract (1710) included part of Sourland Mountain. Each farm on the flatland was assigned a separate strip of woodland that ran up to the Hunterdon border, all crossing Rock Brook. At points along the stream mills were built either to saw lumber or to grind grain. Other early mill sites were at Rocky Hill on the Millstone River, Bridgepoint on Pike Brook and on Bedens Brook near Blawenburg.

Settlement began in the first quarter of the eighteenth century. When churches, schools, general stores, blacksmith shops and hotel/taverns were built, they tended to cluster at intersections or other important points. For example, the intersection where the Carrier Clinic now stands used to be called Plainville or Posttown, having in the nineteenth century a post office, store, school house, blacksmith and wheelwright shops, as well as a hotel/tavern where the circuit judge presided. Most people walked to where they wanted to go. Schools were generally spaced no further than apart in order that no child would have to go more than to reach the nearest school. Churches marked the most important centers. The Dutch Church&#x27;s earliest congregations first gathered in farm houses. The first church building at Harlingen dates to around 1750 and was called the Church at Sourland. The church at Neshanic in Hillsborough Township was established in 1752. In the early years these two churches shared a single pastor, and up to about 1800 they conducted their services in the Dutch language. One such pastor was Martinus Van Harlingen, who gave his name to the village, to the church that now bears his name, and to the local Historical Society. The Blawenburg church, an offshoot of the one at Harlingen, dates to 1830 and was erected in three days.

During the Revolution, the Township was the scene of marches by both British and patriot forces and of clashes between them. In the century that followed the movement of goods and people was accelerated by increasingly swifter forms of transportation. First was the building of the Georgetown and Franklin Turnpike between Lambertville and New Brunswick (1820–1822: Route 518). Next came the digging of the Delaware and Raritan Canal along the east side of the Millstone River (1834). Railroad construction followed with the Delaware and Bound Brook Railroad (later the Reading), which established depots at Skillman, Harlingen and Belle Mead (1875). In the early years of the twentieth century, the arrival of the automobile, of electricity and of the telephone brought further growth and change. In consequence, and over time, the one or two room schoolhouse was supplanted by the central school, post offices were consolidated and most of the hotels/taverns disappeared. The crossroad hamlets that once offered basic services of general store, blacksmith shops and the like disappeared also, many leaving only their names to mark a road or an area: Skillman, Bridgepoint and Dutchtown are examples.

The paving and realignment of roads, and the building of new ones, came toward the end of the transportation revolution. A new major north–south highway, Route 206, was created in 1927. Before that time Montgomery and Mount Lucas Roads were parts of the chief north–south route through the center of the Township. Farming continued despite many changes in the economy and in agricultural practices. In the late nineteenth century subsistence farming was giving way to specialized operations, such as dairying, poultry farming, and fruit orchards. As the twentieth century drew to a close even these ventures no longer offered the farmer an easy existence, given the rapidly appreciating value of the land, over against the low prices of products produced on it. As farms became less and less profitable, the land was converted to other uses. For example, in 1898 the facility for the treatment of epileptics was built on farmland between Blawenburg and Skillman. Since the Second World War, housing developments, shopping centers and business parks have sprung up, leaving as remnants of the long tradition of agriculture in Montgomery roadside stands, riding stables and the like.

As rapid growth throughout the Princeton area has spread suburban sprawl across the Township, the push to limit runaway development and to acquire open space has become an urgent concern of the community. In the last decade of the twentieth century, Montgomery&#x27;s population nearly doubled, making it the fastest growing township in the county.

==Parks and recreation==

===Skillman Village===
In 2007, the Township of Montgomery purchased a parcel of land once known as the North Princeton Developmental Center from the State of New Jersey, located in Montgomery adjoining Skillman Road and Burnt Hill Road. In addition, the Township acquired from the State the adjacent wastewater treatment facility on , behind the State-owned Skillman Dairy Farm. The NPDC property, originally established in 1898 as the &quot;New Jersey State Village for Epileptics,&quot; operated as a self-contained community that consisted of hospitals, housing, maintenance areas, schools, a power plant, a wastewater treatment facility and an on-site landfill. Later, it became the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute. Most recently, and until 1998, the property was the New Jersey Department of Human Services&#x27; psychiatric care facility &quot;North Princeton Developmental Center&quot;.

For years there were over 100 buildings on the Property, mostly in substandard, unsafe, unsanitary, dilapidated and/or obsolescent condition. Ninety-two of these buildings were abated and demolished summer 2007. The remaining handful of buildings have been boarded up in anticipation of possible reuse as part of redevelopment. Efforts are ongoing to remediate environmental conditions at the site and repair or demolish the dam and restore the lake. The property&#x27;s environmental contamination must be remediated and brought into compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The original plan for the land was development. The Township prepared a redevelopment plan and solicited redevelopment proposals for a &quot;Town Square&quot; concept which would have created hundreds of new residential and commercial units. However, no developers submitted bids.

Throughout the rest of 2008 and all of the next few years, the debate over Skillman Village changed. The local Republican team led by Kacey Dyer and Mark Caliguire proposed selling all of the land to Somerset County to create a passive-use park.

In October 2010, Somerset County agreed to purchase the land for a passive-use park for $14.1 million.

===Skillman Park===

The borough is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council. This form provides for a strong-mayor type of government, in which the mayor has executive functions and the legislative branch is the borough council. The councilmembers and mayor are elected in even-numbered years at the November general election to staggered four-year terms of office in partisan elections on an at-large basis, with four council seats up for election together and then the mayor and the other three council seats up for election at the same time, two years later. The Municipal Judge is appointed by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council, and serves for three years. The mayor runs the borough on a day-to-day basis and ensures the enforcement of the legislation passed by the council.

, the Mayor of North Plainfield is Democrat Lawrence J. La Ronde, whose term of office ends December 31, 2024. Members of the North Plainfield Borough Council are Council President Frank A. &quot;Skip&quot; Stabile III (D, 2024), Council Vice President Everett Merrill (D, 2022), Aimee Corzo (D, 2024), Suezette Given (D, 2022; elected to serve an unexpired term), Steve McIntyre (D, 2022; elected to serve an unexpired term), Keiona R. Miller (D, 2024) and Wendy Schaefer (D, 2022).

Singleterry until he resigned from office on the last day of December to take office on the Somerset County Board of County Commissioners.

<doc id="125720" wikidata="Q1083371" url="?curid=125720" title="Raritan, New Jersey">
<text>Raritan is a borough in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,835, its highest decennial census count ever and an increase of 954 (+13.9%) from the 2010 census count of 6,881, which in turn had reflected an increase of 543 (+8.6%) from the 6,338 counted at the 2000 census.

The borough&#x27;s name is derived from the Raritans, a Native American group of Lenape. The name of the tribe is said to mean &quot;forked river&quot;, &quot;stream overflows&quot;, or &quot;point on a tidal river&quot;.

==History==
Raritan town was originally established as a subdivision within Bridgewater Township by act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 3, 1868. Despite its size, the town has an extensive history, that encompasses local, national, and even global history.

===Raritan Woolen Mills===

The town&#x27;s location on the Raritan River, a major artery for the use of trading goods into New York City, contributed it in being a bustling mill town during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Raritan Woolen Mills was established in 1846, as a major producer of textiles, known throughout the United States. Its name changed to the Somerset Manufacturing Company in 1882, employing as many as 400 people during its peak at the turn of the century. The mill created uniforms and blankets for the Union Army during the Civil War, along with uniforms for the United States Army during World War I.

===End of World War I===

The Knox–Porter Resolution ending United States involvement in World War I was signed by President Harding at the estate of New Jersey Senator Joseph S. Frelinghuysen Sr. on July 2, 1921. That Memorial plaque marking of the Frelinghuysen estate is located in the borough.

===Creation of the borough===

After a series of bitter lawsuits between Raritan and Bridgewater in the 1930s and 1940s, the Legislature allowed Raritan to become a fully independent borough by an Act on May 12, 1948, based on the results of a referendum passed on June 12, 1948. The new borough incorporated the old town and an additional portion of Bridgewater Township.

==Geography==

U.S. Routes 202 and 206 intersect with NJ Route 28 at the Somerville Circle on the borders with Bridgewater Township and Somerville, with the eastern half of the circle located in Raritan. As part of an ongoing effort to improve traffic safety at the circle, the New Jersey Department of Transportation has made a series of changes to the structure of the traffic circle, originally constructed during the 1930s. With the suburbanization of the area, the circle was handling an average of 70,000 vehicles each day.

<text>Rocky Hill is a borough in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Named for the Rocky Hill Ridge, this historic village is nestled within the heart of the Raritan Valley region, located alongside the course of the Millstone River.

As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 743, an increase of 61 (+8.9%) from the 2010 census count of 682, which in turn reflected an increase of 20 (+3.0%) from the 662 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
The earliest European settlement in the area began after John Harrison negotiated the purchase of land in 1701 from the Lenape Native Americans. Speaking an Algonquian language, they had occupied the area for centuries prior to the arrival of European settlers. Bands of Lenape lived along the coast from Connecticut through New York and New Jersey and south to Maryland and Delaware.

In 1783, during the American Revolutionary War, General George Washington camped at Rockingham, the house owned by the Berrien family. He passed through the area again in 1789 on his way to New York City for his inauguration as President of the United States. Before roads were improved, it was known as the Devil&#x27;s Featherbed because it was difficult to travel the rocky terrain by horse and wagon.

Rocky Hill was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on December 18, 1889, from portions of Montgomery Township. This was based on the results of a referendum held four days earlier.

<text>Somerset is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Franklin Township, in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2010 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 22,083.

Somerset housed one of the first Marconi Wireless Stations in the United States.

==History==
New Brunswick Marconi Station was located at JFK Boulevard and Easton Avenue just a few minutes from the New Brunswick border. Today it is the site of Marconi Park. It was an early radio transmitter facility built in 1913 and operated by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America. After the interruption of transatlantic telegraph cables by enemy action, the facility was confiscated by the United States Navy on April 7, 1917, to provide transatlantic communications during World War I. The New Brunswick Naval Radio Station was the principal wartime communication link between the United States and Europe, using the callsign NFF. President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points speech was transmitted from the site in 1918. After the war, ownership of the station, along with Marconi&#x27;s other US assets, was transferred from the navy to RCA. The antenna masts were demolished in 1952 to make room for what is now a small mall containing a Kmart, but the buildings on the other side of JFK Boulevard were spared. All but one of the brick buildings were demolished around 2004 to make way for a storage locker facility. The bricks and tiles were saved for use in any future restoration of the spared building, and the Marconi facility in Belmar, New Jersey.

During World War I, the original Marconi spark-gap transmitter was replaced with an Alexanderson alternator, the invention of the famous General Electric engineer, with an output power of 200 kilowatts and looking like an ordinary power station generator. Its frequency was around 17 kHz, which made its wavelength around 17,500 meters. The station used a huge antenna supported by eight tall steel masts, similar to the AT&amp;T long wave telephone transmitter at RCA&#x27;s Rocky Point, Long Island, transmitter facility.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of 6.444 square miles (16.692 km2), including 6.327 square miles (16.388 km2) of land and 0.117 square miles (0.304 km2) of water (1.82%).

<doc id="125723" wikidata="Q1088776" url="?curid=125723" title="Somerville, New Jersey">
<text>Somerville is a borough in and the county seat of Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough is located in the heart of the Raritan Valley region within the New York Metropolitan Area, located about from Manhattan and from Staten Island. The borough has grown to become a commercial hub for central New Jersey and commuter town of New York City.

As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 12,346, an increase of 248 (+2.0%) from the 2010 census count of 12,098, which in turn reflected a decline of 325 (-2.6%) from the 12,423 counted in the 2000 census.

Somerville was originally formed as a town on March 25, 1863, within a portion of Bridgewater Township. Somerville was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 16, 1909, based on the results of a referendum held on May 4, 1909, at which point it was fully set off from Bridgewater Township. It is home of the oldest competitive bicycle race in the United States.

The borough is named for Somerset in England.

==History==
===Early development===
Somerville was settled in colonial times primarily by the Dutch who purchased land from the English proprietors of the colony. The Dutch established their church near what is today Somerville and a Dutch Reformed minister or Domine lived at the Old Dutch Parsonage from about 1754. The early village grew up around a church, courthouse and a tavern built at a crossroads shortly after the American Revolution. The name &quot;Somerville&quot; was taken from four brothers of the Somerville family, Edward, John and James from Drishane and Castlehaven, County Cork, Ireland, who first founded the town in the 1750s. Somerville was originally a sparsely populated farming community, but rapidly grew after the completion of the railroad in the 1840s and development of water power along the Raritan River in the 1850s. Early industry included brick making from the plentiful red clay and shale on which Somerville is built. While much of the borough features distinctive Victorian architecture in several neighborhoods and along its Main Street, other periods are represented. National Register sites in Somerville include the white marble 1909 Somerville Court House and the wooden and stone colonial Wallace House (today a museum) where George Washington spent a winter during the American Revolutionary War. Near the Wallace House is the Old Dutch Parsonage, where Reverend Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh, a founder and first president of Rutgers University, then called Queens College, lived. Register listed Victorian structures include the James Harper Smith Estate (privately owned), St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church and rectory, and the Fire Museum (a vintage fire house). Other notable, register eligible structures are the Victorian train station (privately owned) and the municipal building, the former Robert Mansion.

Originally the center of local commerce, the borough has evolved into a destination for boutique retail and dining. Modern highways today surround and traverse Somerville, including U.S. Route 22, U.S. Route 202, U.S. Route 206 and Route 28 and is within of Interstate 287 and Interstate 78, making it an important hub in central New Jersey.

===Tour of Somerville===
In 1940, the first competitive bicycle race, called the Tour of Somerville was established by bicycle shop owner, Fred Kugler, to showcase his son, Furman, who was a national cycling champion, and who won the initial men&#x27;s competition. His daughter, Mildred won the women&#x27;s. The 50-mile race is held annually and has since become the oldest competitive bicycle race in the U.S. It carries a purse of $10,000 for each winner of the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s races.

===Downtown today===

Main Street Somerville maintains most of its historical buildings, although many are now boutique specialty shops and second-hand shops. Somerville has quite a diverse and large selection of restaurants that draw people from the surrounding area. In many ways, Somerville remains Somerset County&#x27;s downtown, and is the heart of its designated Regional Center. Several of the factories in Somerville were abandoned and replaced with modern office buildings or remodeled as apartments. Somerville today and historically has had an important African American community, a distinguished member of which was Paul Robeson. Another famous Somerville native was famed character actor Lee Van Cleef. One of the founders of modern American Dance, Ruth St. Denis, made her professional debut at Somerset Hall, once a vaudeville theatre and today a local restaurant. The mix of modern amenities and an interesting and diverse past make Main Street, Somerville a unique destination for dining, strolling and visiting.

===Future redevelopment===
The shopping center on the west side of the downtown area was demolished and a new shopping center, town homes and other amenities will be built on the shopping center land and on adjacent land in the former borough landfill to the south. Ground was broken for a new &quot;world class&quot; ShopRite supermarket in March 2011 and opened in November 2011. Borough planners envision a transit village style redevelopment centered around the Somerville train station.

===Hurricane Floyd===
Somerville was hit hard by Hurricane Floyd in September 1999, despite its having been downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it impacted the vicinity. The borough received a record of rain over three days during the slow moving storm, causing significant flooding and considerable damage.

===Regulation concerns===
Numerous local and national media publications reported on how the state of New Jersey had eased regulations allowing for home baked goods to be made and sold from a home, but how Somerville in particular still suffers from, &quot;...[a] draconian ordinance that creates a contradiction between Somerville&#x27;s zoning policies and New Jersey&#x27;s home baking law...&quot; making it difficult for a small business owner or entrepreneur to try and earn a living in this fashion in Somerville. In order to be able to make her cookies and sell them from her home kitchen was required &quot;... to pay a $1,000 application fee and put $4,000 into a borough escrow account&quot;, in addition to notifying neighbors, placing a public notice advertisement and having a public hearing on the application.

<text>South Bound Brook is a borough in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,863, an increase of 300 (+6.6%) from the 2010 census count of 4,563, which in turn reflected an increase of 71 (+1.6%) from the 4,492 counted in the 2000 census.

What is now South Bound Brook was originally formed as a town within Franklin Township. On March 16, 1869, the name of the community was changed to Bloomington, which lasted until May 29, 1891, when the name reverted to South Bound Brook town. South Bound Brook was incorporated as an independent borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 11, 1907, based on the results of a referendum held on May 1, 1907.

==History==

The area had historically been occupied by the Lenape Native Americans. The first European settlement was in 1681 and a community was established near the Bound Brook stream of the same name, which flows into the Raritan River via the Green Brook on the eastern side of the borough. The brook, which was mentioned as a boundary in a Native American deed, provides the source of the borough&#x27;s name.

The area was originally a Dutch community with apple orchards and just west peach orchards. The Abraham Staats House (), located on the south side of Main Street, served as the headquarters of Baron Von Steuben during the American Revolutionary War. The house remained a private home until it was acquired by the Borough of South Bound Brook in 1999. It was placed on the New Jersey and National Registers in 2002. It is currently the headquarters for the Friends of Abraham Staats House, Inc. https://www.staatshouse.org, who maintain it as a museum.

A wooden bridge over the Raritan River was erected as early as 1761 and named Queen&#x27;s Bridge in 1767. Later, it became a covered bridge. During the Revolutionary War, the bridge was used repeatedly by both sides including during the Battle of Bound Brook in 1777. In 1875, the wooden bridge was replaced by a steel pipe truss bridge. More than 100 years later, that bridge was itself replaced by a steel girder bridge in 1984, still using the old pillars. The bridge was renovated and paved in 2007.

At this spot on January 4, 1777, General Washington decided to move his troops to Morristown for the winter, thus ending the victorious Trenton-Princeton campaign, rather than attack New Brunswick.

The Battle of Bound Brook, one of the battles in the New York and New Jersey campaign during the American Revolutionary War, occurred on April 13, 1777, and resulted in a defeat for the Continental Army, who were routed by about 4,000 troops under British command.

At dawn on April 13, 1777, Hessian Captain Ewald&#x27;s assault over the Queens Bridge spanning the Raritan River between South Bound Brook and Bound Brook was pinned down by &quot;murderous fire&quot; from the American soldiers stationed at half moon battery. Advancing North along present day Easton Avenue, Hessian Colonel Donop pushed aside American outposts and arrived 15 minutes after Ewald&#x27;s attack had faltered. Advancing over the Queens Bridge, Donop&#x27;s troops engaged the Americans causing them to retreat from the battery. Donop, Ewald&#x27;s, and General Grant&#x27;s troops pursued the American troops as they fought through the streets of Bound Brook.

The Reformed Church, also on Main Street (near borough hall) was built in 1848 and has been declared a local historical site by the borough council. Originally called the Dutch Reformed Church of Bound Brook, it has gone through very few changes over the years. A pipe organ received from Andrew Carnegie has been removed, and the stained glass windows, which had been added well after the original construction. The Reverend Thomas DeWitt Talmadge was a member and preached at the church.

Originally part of Franklin Township and named Bloomington, South Bound Brook was incorporated as a borough by the New Jersey Legislature in 1907.

In the mid-1970s a teen from the town created a plan for an environmental commission and presented it to the council. James Manley got his commission and the first order of business was to find out what the white piles of waste on the tow path between the Delaware and Raritan Canal and Raritan River consisted of. It turned out to be 17% crystal asbestos by volume. Since there was no New Jersey state regulation for the disposal, this became a landmark case. The waste was hauled in dump trucks through Bound Brook to the floodplain south of West Main Street and dumped. A trail of asbestos dust led from the old dump site to the new dump location.

===Redevelopment===
The main downtown street in South Bound Brook, known as Main Street, has been refurbished with new sidewalks, lighting, signage and a number of newly renovated stores.

A roofing material manufacturing facility known as GAF Manufacturing was located in South Bound Brook for over a century along Main Street. The site was dormant for about two decades and sat as an eyesore and reminder of the town&#x27;s industrial past. New townhomes have been built on the GAF Manufacturing site, along the Delaware and Raritan Canal, which provide the downtown area a new modern look and many new residents.

Part of the redevelopment is being held up by a lawsuit by John Fanaro of Fanaro Carpeting over the right of eminent domain, as the borough tried to seize property along Main Street that is in front of the new townhomes. The redevelopment plan called for the older stores to be razed and replaced with new stores that had parking in back and a dozen rental apartments on the second floor.

A new condominium development along Elizabeth Street in the central part of town was finished in 2010.

==Government==

===Local government===
South Bound Brook is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by South Bound Brook is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of South Bound Brook is Democrat Caryl A. &quot;Chris&quot; Shoffner, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2023. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Richard Eickhorst (D, 2023), Kathleen Connor (D, 2022), Anne Dedousis (D, 2023; appointed to serve an unexpired term), Kathryn M. &quot;Katie&quot; Kelly (R, 2022), Elizabeth Konkle (D, 2024) and Jitendra &quot;Jimmy&quot; Shah (D, 2024).

In February 2022, the borough council appointed Anne Dedousis to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Elizabeth Chu until she resigned from office the previous month.

In August 2015, the borough council selected Kathryn M. Kelly from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by James Holmes until he resigned from office the previous month as he was moving out of the borough. Kelly served on an interim basis until the November 2015 general election, when she was elected to serve the one year remaining on the term of office.

====Political corruption====
In 2005, Republican mayor Jo-Anne Shubert resigned as Mayor of South Bound Brook a week before admitting that she had given a $35,000 no-bid computer contract to a company owned by her brother and where she was employed as an office manager.

In 2010 and 2011, Republican mayor Terry Warrelmann, was involved in a controversy involving his family and the borough&#x27;s refusal to release police reports surrounding the incident. On July 9, 2010, John Paff, filed a lawsuit seeking the release of the documents. On December 17, 2010, New Jersey Superior Court Assignment Judge Yolanda Ciccone, sitting in Somerville, New Jersey, conducted a hearing on Paff&#x27;s lawsuit. On March 31, 2011, Paff received a 79-page file containing the redacted versions of documents within that investigative file. The records show that Mayor Warrelmann, along with his son Stephen, Nancy Santora and an unidentified juvenile, were suspects in an investigation of a November 21, 2009, burglary of a shed in South Bound Brook. No charges, however, were brought against any of the suspects.

==Flooding issues==
While South Bound Brook does not have the legacy of flooding that its sister town Bound Brook on the north bank of the Raritan River has, flooding can be a problem in South Bound Brook during major river flooding events, such as a 100-year flood event. In September 1999, the remnants of Hurricane Floyd caused a record flood crest on the Raritan River. While escaping the worst flooding, due to its elevated perch above the Raritan River, South Bound Brook did experience flood waters in the two- to three-foot range near the canal, including in portions of the downtown area along Main Street.

<text>Warren Township is a township in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is a bedroom suburb of New York City in the much larger New York metropolitan area, located within the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 15,923, an increase of 612 (+4.0%) from the 2010 census count of 15,311, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,052 (+7.4%) from the 14,259 counted in the 2000 census. Warren is situated in northeastern Somerset County bordering both Morris (along the Passaic River) and Union counties.

The township has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Warren Township residents had a median household income of $154,647, ranked 12th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

In 2012, Forbes.com listed Warren as 334th in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes&quot;, with a median home price of $842,750.

==History==
Warren was originally inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans and was colonized in the 1720s by European farmers. As early as 1900, it became a destination for wealthy residents looking to escape nearby New York City. Warren was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 5, 1806, from portions of Bernards Township and Bridgewater Township. The south-eastern half of the original township (which was close to a railroad and contained most of the population) was separated off as North Plainfield Township (since renamed to Green Brook Township) on April 2, 1872.

Warren was named for Revolutionary War patriot, General Joseph Warren, who was killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Warren celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2006.

On January 15, 2021, Kings Food Market announced they would close their Warren location on Mountain Boulevard. The store closed on January 23, 2021.

<text>William Earl &quot;Bootsy&quot; Collins (born October 26, 1951) is an American bass guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Rising to prominence with James Brown in the early 1970s before joining the Parliament-Funkadelic collective, Collins established himself as one of the leading names and innovators in funk with his driving basslines and humorous vocals. He later formed his own P-Funk side project known as &#x27;Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band&#x27;. He was a frequent collaborator with other musicians from a variety of genres, including dance music (Deee-Lite&#x27;s &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot;), electronic big beat (Fatboy Slim&#x27;s &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot; and &quot;The Joker&quot;), and alternative metal (Praxis), among others. He is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with 15 other members of Parliament-Funkadelic. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked Collins number 4 in its list of the 50 greatest bassists of all time.

==Early life==
Collins was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 26, 1951. He said that his mother nicknamed him &quot;Bootsy&quot;. &quot;I asked her why&quot;, he explained to a journalist, &quot;and she just said, &#x27;Because you looked like a Bootsy.&#x27; I left it at that.&quot;

His brother Phelps &quot;Catfish&quot; Collins (1943–2010) was also a musician. He and Bootsy were once part of The Pacemakers.

Collins has maintained a strong connection with Cincinnati.

==Career==
===1960s–1970s===
With his elder brother Phelps &quot;Catfish&quot; Collins, Frankie &quot;Kash&quot; Waddy, and Philippé Wynne, Collins formed a funk band, The Pacemakers, in 1968. In March 1970, after most of the members of James Brown&#x27;s band quit over a pay dispute, The Pacemakers were hired as Brown&#x27;s backing band and they became known as The J.B.&#x27;s. (They are often referred to as the &quot;original&quot; J.B.&#x27;s to distinguish them from later line-ups that went by the same name.) Although they worked for Brown for only 11 months, the original J.B.&#x27;s played on some of Brown&#x27;s most intense funk recordings, including &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine&quot;, &quot;Bewildered (1970)&quot;, &quot;Super Bad&quot;, &quot;Soul Power&quot;, &quot;Talkin&#x27; Loud and Sayin&#x27; Nothing&quot;, and two instrumental singles, the much-sampled &quot;The Grunt&quot; and &quot;These Are the J.B.&#x27;s&quot;. In regards to his tenure working for James Brown, Collins stated:

After parting ways with James Brown, Collins returned to Cincinnati and formed House Guests with his brother Phelps Collins, Rufus Allen, Clayton &quot;Chicken&quot; Gunnels, Frankie Waddy, Ronnie Greenaway and Robert McCullough. The House Guests released &quot;What So Never the Dance&quot; and another single on the House Guests label, as well as a third as The Sound of Vision on the House Guests label.

Next Collins moved to Detroit, Michigan, after Philippé Wynne suggested joining The Spinners, for whom Wynne had been singing. However, following the advice of singer and future Parliament member Mallia Franklin, Collins made another choice. Franklin introduced both Collins brothers to George Clinton, and in 1972, both of the Collins brothers, along with Waddy, joined Funkadelic. Collins played bass on most of Funkadelic and Parliament albums through the early 1980s, garnering several songwriting credits as well.

In 1976 Collins, Catfish, Waddy, Joel Johnson (1953–2018), Gary &quot;Mudbone&quot; Cooper, Robert Johnson and The Horny Horns formed Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band, a separate touring unit of Clinton&#x27;s P-Funk collective. The group recorded five albums together, the first three of which are often considered to be among the quintessential P-Funk recordings. The group&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Bootsy? Player of the Year&quot; reached the top of the R&amp;B album chart and spawned the #1 R&amp;B single &quot;Bootzilla&quot;.

Like Clinton, Collins took on several alter egos, from Casper the Funky Ghost to Bootzilla, &quot;the world&#x27;s only rhinestone rockstar monster of a doll&quot;, all as parts of the evolving character of an alien rock star who grew gradually more bizarre as time went on (see P-Funk mythology). He also adopted his trademark &quot;space bass&quot; around this time.

===1980s–1990s===
Collins released two 1980 albums, his first &quot;solo&quot; album &quot;Ultra Wave&quot;, and &quot;Sweat Band&quot;, on George Clinton&#x27;s Uncle Jam label with a group billed as Bootsy&#x27;s Sweat Band. He also was credited for co-producing the debut of P-Funk spinoff Zapp.

In 1984, he collaborated with Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads to produce &quot;Five Minutes&quot;, a dance record sampled and edited from Ronald Reagan&#x27;s infamous &quot;We begin bombing in five minutes&quot; speech. The record was credited to &quot;Bonzo goes to Washington&quot; (also referenced in the 1985 Ramones song &quot;Bonzo Goes to Bitburg&quot;, derived from Reagan&#x27;s starring role as Professor Peter Boyd in the 1951 comedy film &quot;Bedtime for Bonzo&quot;).

After a nearly five-year hiatus, he had a comeback in 1988 (with some help from producer Bill Laswell). &quot;What&#x27;s Bootsy Doin&#x27;?&quot; flaunted a new sound that foreshadowed the 1990s, such as the dance floor smash &quot;Party on Plastic&quot;. Laswell introduced Collins to Herbie Hancock, resulting in &quot;Perfect Machine&quot; (1988). The techno-funk they recorded featured turntables for scratch appeal, and the smoothly-stylized vocals of Leroy &quot;Sugarfoot&quot; Bonner of chart-topping Ohio Players. These were the first of many collaborations between Laswell and Collins on many albums and projects, with the prolific producer using Bootsy mainly as a bassist but sometimes as a rhythm guitarist.

In 1988, Collins appeared as a guest artist to play bass on Keith Richards and The X-Pensive Winos album &quot;Talk is Cheap&quot;.

In 1989, Collins played bass on and produced several tracks of Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s album &quot;Waltz Darling&quot;, credited to Malcolm McLaren and the Bootzilla Orchestra.

In 1990, Collins collaborated with Deee-Lite on their biggest hit &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot;, and he contributed additional vocals. Although he also appeared in the music video playing the bass, the bassline in the song is actually a sample of a Herbie Hancock song called &quot;Bring Down the Birds&quot;. Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band became the de facto backing musicians for Deee-Lite during a world tour. The Rubber Band also recorded the EP &quot;Jungle Bass&quot;, their first recording in 11 years.

In 1992, he joined with guitarist Stevie Salas and drummer Buddy Miles to form the funk-metal fusion group Hardware. The trio released one album, &quot;Third Eye Open&quot;, before disbanding. In the same year, Collins played bass guitar on the first Praxis album (produced by Laswell): &quot;Transmutation&quot;, alongside fellow Parliament-Funkadelic member Bernie Worrell, Bryan Mantia and Buckethead.

Bootsy&#x27;s New Rubber Band formed in 1994, releasing &quot;Blasters of the Universe&quot; and also put forth the following live release &quot;Keepin&#x27; dah Funk Alive 4-1995&quot;, recorded over two nights in Tokyo.
In 1995, Collins played in the remake of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot;, for Axiom Funk, a Funkadelic-like one-off supergroup produced by Bill Laswell and featuring (Funkadelic members) George Clinton, Bernie Worrell, Collins, (the guitar of the late) Eddie Hazel, Gary Shider and Laswell. The group released only one album (&quot;Funkcronomicon&quot;), and the song also appeared in the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Stealing Beauty&quot;. He also featured on Jon B&#x27;s song &quot;Simple Melody&quot; from his debut album, &quot;Bonafide&quot;.

Collins collaborated with Del McCoury, Doc Watson and Mac Wiseman to form the GrooveGrass Boyz. They produced a fusion of bluegrass and funk.

===2000s–present===
Collins provided lead vocals for the Fatboy Slim song &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot; from his 2000 album &quot;Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars&quot;. Collins vocals quote the book &quot;Dune&quot; (&quot;Walk without rhythm and you won&#x27;t attract the worm&quot;). The song won multiple MTV Video Music Awards and a Grammy Award for Best Music Video.

In 2004 Collins contributed to Christian rap artist TobyMac&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to Diverse City&quot; album, collaborating on the &quot;Diverse City&quot; track, a song praised as one of the best on the album. The album won the 2005 Dove Award for Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year.

In October 2005, Collins co-wrote a song celebrating the resurgence of his hometown team, the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League called &quot;Fear Da Tiger&quot; which features &quot;raps&quot; written and performed by several Bengals players, including defensive end Duane Clemons, offensive tackle Stacy Andrews, and center Ben Wilkerson. An edited version of the song was made into a music video which features cameos by many other Bengals players. Collins appeared with Little Richard, Bernie Worrell, and other notable musicians as the band playing with Hank Williams, Jr. for the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; opening during for the 2006 season. Collins was the only all star to return with Williams for the 2007 season.

He also sings &quot;Marshal Law&quot;, the theme song of the Cincinnati Marshals indoor football team and debuted the song in 2006 at half time of the April 29 Marshals home game against the West Palm Beach Phantoms.

In 2006, ABC Entertainment/A Charly Films Release released a DVD and CD from Collins and the New Rubber Band&#x27;s concert at the 1998 North Sea Jazz Festival. Soon after the release, Collins split from long-time friend and guitarist Odhran &quot;The Bodhran&quot; Rameriz, citing creative differences as the reason.

Later that same year, Collins released the holiday album &quot;Christmas Is 4 Ever&quot;. This represents the first Christmas-themed album made by a member of the P-Funk musical collective. The album features re-workings of Christmas standards as well as original compositions.

In April 2007, Collins announced plans to open Bootsy&#x27;s, a restaurant/club with Cincinnati area restaurateur Jeff Ruby. The venue operated from 2008 to 2010. It featured live musical acts, a museum dedicated to Collins&#x27;s musical career and Spanish, Central and South American cuisine.

In June 2007, Collins, along with Catfish Collins, Clyde Stubblefield, John &quot;Jabo&quot; Starks, and Bernie Worrell, participated in the recording of the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Superbad&quot;. In December of that year they (without Worrell) went on to perform the first tribute concert remembering James Brown.

In July 2007, Collins also told &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine that he was working on a project named Science Faxtion and an album called &quot;Living on Another Frequency&quot; in which he serves as bassist and co-producer along with his lead vocalist Greg Hampton. The band also features guitarist Buckethead and drummer Brain. The album was released in November 2008.

Collins promoted Rock the Vote for its 2008 campaign together with Buckethead.

Collins portrayed a radio DJ in the 2013 video game, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, in which several of his own songs were featured.

Collins has also collaborated extensively with Bill Laswell, Buckethead, and also frequently collaborated with fellow bassist Victor Wooten.

In 2018, Collins did a song with singer Kali Uchis called &quot;After the Storm&quot;.

On December 14, 2018, Collins played a show with Detroit-based funk artist GRiZ, and also collaborated on a new song with GRiZ.

In January 2019, Collins announced on Facebook that he would be retiring from live performances for health reasons:

He wrote that he would be releasing a new album that year, and that he would continue to work in the studio and mentor young musicians.

On February 25, 2021, it was announced that Collins would be making an appearance as the &quot;special guest host&quot; of &quot;An Evening with Silk Sonic&quot;, the first studio album from Silk Sonic, a collaboration between Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak. He was the one who came up with the band&#x27;s name (much like he did with Babyface), and acts as the album&#x27;s narrator, &quot;threading&quot; the songs together.

On July 7, 2022, Collins served as emcee for the opening ceremony for the 2022 World Games in Birmingham, Alabama.

===Basses===
Collins has owned many basses, several of which are custom made. His original Space Bass and its first replacement were made in Warren, Michigan by Larry Pless of Gus Zoppi&#x27;s music store. The first Space Bass had a mahogany body and maple neck, white finish, and mirror pick guard. This is the Space Bass on the cover of 1976 album &quot; Stretchin&#x27; Out in Bootsy&#x27;s Rubber Band&quot;. Collins&#x27;s original Space Bass guitar was stolen, but it was later recovered at a Cincinnati pawn shop and returned to him.

Another Collins signature instrument is a custom-built star-shaped bass guitar he also calls the Space Bass, built for him by Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Salvador of GuitarCraft in 1998. In 2006 Collins made an agreement with Traben to make a signature Collins model bass, the Bootzilla. During the 2010 NAMM Show, Collins&#x27;s new signature bass was released by Warwick, a customized Infinity Bass called &quot;Bootsy Collins Black Star Signature Bass&quot; or &quot;Bootsy Collins Orange Star Signature Bass&quot;, depending on the color of the stars on it.

===Funk University===
In July 2010, Collins, in partnership with former child actor Cory Danziger, launched Funk University (&quot;Funk U&quot;), an online-only bass guitar school in which he also serves as curator and lead professor. Funk University offers an intense curriculum tailored for intermediate to advanced bass players as well as anyone interested in a deeper understanding of funk. The curriculum is based on bass theory, history of funk, and Collins&#x27;s own musical history given by Collins himself, augmented by lessons and exercises in bass and rhythm from guest bassist professors such as Les Claypool, Meshell Ndegeocello, John B (Williams) and Victor Wooten. As of 2021, Funk University is now defunct.

==Legacy==
He has been mentioned in the song &quot;Genius of Love&quot; by Tom Tom Club in the line &quot;Clinton&#x27;s musicians such as Bootsy Collins raise expectation to a new intention&quot;, while &quot;Got more bass than Bootsy Collins&quot; is a line in the song &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; by the Fugees. His influence in popular culture is seen in that he has been referenced by a number of television series. In &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; episode &quot;Sooooooul Train&quot;, Geoffrey sneaks into the &quot;Soul Train&quot; tapings posing as Collins, while in &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; episode &quot;The Legend of Old Gregg&quot; an alien creature named &quot;The Funk&quot; lands on Collins&#x27;s house, giving him his ability to play the bass guitar &quot;like some kinda delirious funky priest&quot;, as well as the ability to see around corners.

Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, who cited Collins as one of his primary influences, appeared in unmistakably Collins-style clothing in the video for RHCP&#x27;s &quot;Dani California&quot;, and Collins&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s a Telephone Bill?&quot; was sampled for 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;Str8 Ballin&#x27;&quot; track from his &quot;Thug Life: Volume 1&quot; album. Les Claypool has also cited Collins as a musical influence.

In 2004 Collins was featured on the cover of &quot;The Joker&quot; on the Fatboy Slim album &quot;Palookaville&quot;. Collins served as Heineken&#x27;s Amsterjam 2005 curator and master of ceremonies on Randall&#x27;s Island, New York. On January 26, 2007, Collins gave the commencement address at the graduation ceremony at The Art Institute of Ohio – Cincinnati.

===Awards and achievements===
Collins appeared with Toots &amp; the Maytals on the album &quot;True Love&quot; that won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 2005.

In October 2010, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine at the Key Club in Los Angeles. Collins was inducted in 2016 into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

On July 22, 2023, Bootsy Collins was inducted into the Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame.

==Personal life==
In March 2011, Collins and his wife visited Franklin L. Williams M.S #7&#x27;s Little Kids Rock program, donated a bass, gave the children a bass lesson, and rapped with them while they played the blues. He is now an honorary board member of the organization. Collins is an honorary member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity.

In an April 2011 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Collins stated that, at one point in his life, he took LSD every day for over two years.

Collins guest starred as himself at the end of &quot;Mid-Season Finale&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Patrick Star Show&quot;, a spin-off of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants,&quot; in 2022.

Collins is the voice of Jimi Hendrix in the 2010 documentary, &quot;Jimi Hendrix: Voodoo Child&quot;, which is based on Hendrix&#x27;s own words from letters, interviews and other printed materials.

<text>Watchung () is a borough in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located approximately west of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 6,449, an increase of 648 (+11.2%) from the 2010 census count of 5,801, which in turn reflected an increase of 188 (+3.3%) from the 5,613 counted in the 2000 census. It is located within the Raritan Valley region.

Watchung was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 23, 1926, from portions of North Plainfield Township (now Green Brook Township) based on the results of a referendum held on April 20, 1926. The name &quot;Watchung&quot; comes from the Lenni Lenape Native Americans, meaning &quot;high hills&quot; or from &quot;watschu,&quot; meaning &quot;hill.&quot;

In 2012, Forbes.com listed Watchung as 384th in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes&quot;, with a median home price of $767,507.

The borough is one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2014–2018, Watchung residents had a median household income of $153,341, almost double the statewide median of $79,363.

==History==
George Washington surveyed the British troops in Perth Amboy, 20 miles away, from the first ridge of the Watchung Mountains. The eastern edge of these ridges reaches to the Oranges in the direction of Newark. The name &quot;Washingtonville&quot; was used in early times, but was rejected as the name for the area by the United States Postal Service, which felt that the state already had too many places named Washington.

Watchung, in the 1900s was a semi-rural small community of about 3,200 people in comparison with the relatively larger and more urban communities of Plainfield and Somerville. The first mayor of the town was Henry Baldwin Macdonald, who served from 1926 to 1928. The 1967 Plainfield riots, caused an exodus of the large upper-middle class population from the nearby cities to the Watchung Hills area to communities such as Watchung, Warren Township and Bridgewater Township.

Watchung was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 23, 1926, from portions of North Plainfield Township (now Green Brook Township) based on the results of a referendum held on April 20, 1926.
In the wake of public fear that ensued after the 1938 radio broadcast of Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, National Guard troops were stationed around the hills in Watchung, as told on the vinyl record recording of news reports of the day.

Notable figures who have lived in Watchung include Bobby Thomson, Billy Ard and Carl Banks.

<text>Andover Township is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 5,996, a decrease of 323 (−5.1%) from the 2010 census count of 6,319, which in turn reflected an increase of 286 (+4.7%) from the 6,033 counted in the 2000 census.

Andover was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 11, 1864, from portions of Newton Township, which was split up on that date and dissolved. Portions of the township were taken to form Fredon Township (February 24, 1904) and Andover borough (March 25, 1904). Portions of the township were ceded to Newton town in both 1869 and 1927.

The township was suggestively named after the existing village of Andover, whose name origin is not certain, though sources indicate that the name comes from Andover, Hampshire, England. In the years before World War II, Andover Township was home to Camp Nordland, a retreat and gathering place covering owned and operated by the German American Bund, an American Nazi organization devoted to promoting a favorable view of Nazi Germany. Camp Nordland was shut down by the federal government after Germany declared war on the United States and sold at auction in 1944. The property eventually was acquired by Andover Township and is now called Hillside Park with a recreational hall and sports fields.

The borough is located in the northernmost region of Sussex County.

Branchville was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 9, 1898, from portions of Frankford Township. An additional portion of Frankford Township was annexed as of March 1, 1951. The borough was named for its site at a branch of the Paulins Kill.

==History==

Branchville was established by settlers from Connecticut in the 18th century. It grew quickly and in the 1820s the town was divided into building lots. By the year 1844, it was a well-established community with 32 dwellings, mills, blacksmiths, an academy, a church and a variety of other factories and businesses.

The addition of two water-powered mills and a dam in 1855 furthered the community&#x27;s prosperity. Energy would later be harnessed from this dam and a second one that was built to supply Branchville with electricity and its own power company.

Extension of rail service on the Sussex Railroad to Branchville in 1869 brought an even greater boon to the community&#x27;s economic growth. From 1869 to 1871, forty new homes were built. The railroad had made it possible to ship products from the local mills and creameries to larger urban areas to the east. With lake communities nearby, tourism was also spurred by the railroad. As many as six trains a day would bring people from the larger cities to enjoy a country vacation.

==Geography==

Branchville is an independent municipality completely surrounded by Frankford Township, making it part of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Branchville has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

===Geology===
Branchville is on the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation. This is a shale, slate, and limestone formation created 450 million years ago when a chain of volcanic islands collided with proto North America. The islands went over the North American Plate, creating the Highlands of Sussex County and the Kittatinny Valley. Millions of years of erosion occurred and there was a second event. About 400 million years ago a small continent that was long and thin, collided with proto North America creating folding and faulting. The Silurian Shawangunk conglomerate that was under a shallow sea, lifted due to pressure. The pressure created heat which melted the silica and bonded the quartz and conglomerate together, creating Kittatinny Mountain.

The Wisconsin Glacier covered all of Branchville from 21,000 BCE to 13,000 BCE, covering the top of Kittatinny Mountain. End moraines exist in Stokes State Forest, another just off Route 565 north of the Skylands Park and one about a mile south of Ross&#x27;s Corner. An esker was created when the glacier retreated due to climate warming. Many ponds and lakes created. Culver Lake was created at this time, as the drainage became blocked. Branchville is drained by Culver&#x27;s Lake Creek and Dry brook. Dry Creek starts at the Branchville Reservoir, travels south, enters into Culver&#x27;s Creek in Branchville and eventually empties into the Paulinskill. There is a chain of hills between Dry Creek and Papakatin Creek. These hills are what separate the Paulinskill River drainage system from that of the Wallkill. The drainage divide is just north of Route 206 and the goes northwest toward Branchville Reservoir. Water near Route 206 or south of Route 206 drains into the Paulinskill. Water north of Route 206 drains into the Wallkill River.

<text>Byram Township is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 8,028, a decrease of 322 (−3.9%) from the 2010 census count of 8,350, which in turn reflected an increase of 96 (+1.2%) from the 8,254 counted in the 2000 census.

The municipality is known as the &quot;Township of Lakes&quot;, as there are roughly two dozen lakes and ponds within its borders.

==History==
Byram Township was created by an act by the New Jersey General Assembly on February 5, 1798, from portions of the now-defunct Newton Township, and was incorporated on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships. The township was named for the Byram family, who were early settlers in the area. Patriarch Jephthah Byram and his family, were believed to have emigrated to the area after the American Revolutionary War. Before being named Byram, the community had been called Lockwood, and the Lockwood Tavern continued to hold this original name until its demolition in 2015. In 1829, a section of Green Township was incorporated into the township. Portions of the township have been taken to form Sparta township (April 14, 1845), Brooklyn borough (March 24, 1898, now called Hopatcong) and Stanhope borough (March 24, 1904).

There are many historical sites located in Byram. The town&#x27;s oldest structure, the 1802 Leport House, stands by the Byram General Store on Sparta-Stanhope Road. The Lockwood Cemetery, established around 1818, consists of about 30 gravestones and the remnants of a church&#x27;s foundation. The 1853 Roseville Schoolhouse was moved from its original location on Lackawanna Drive to Mansfield Drive, reopening in September 1986 as the Roseville Schoolhouse Museum.

In 1911, the Lackawanna Cut-Off rail line opened through Byram Township, with a station stop near the current Forest Lakes neighborhood. The Cut-Off was part of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad&#x27;s mainline from Hoboken, New Jersey to Buffalo, New York. The railroad was important in providing transportation for mines in Northern Jersey. It passes through Byram for a long distance. It runs mainly along Roseville, but as Roseville veers north, the tracks continue west. The line was abandoned in 1980 and the tracks were removed four years later. There is a proposal to reactivate passenger service via NJ Transit in the future, with work underway at the Roseville Tunnel.

In 2001, then-mayor Richard Bowe called for an investigation of weather forecasters due to a snowstorm that had been forecast but never materialized, arguing that forecasters should be held responsible for the &quot;excessive overtime costs&quot; that the township experienced and for losses of local businesses shut in advance of the predicted snowfall.

===Mining===
Byram Township had a very large mining industry in the past. The largest mine, The Roseville Mine, is located on the current Roseville Road. The mine is in a quadrilateral plot of land, with the southwestern corner created by Roseville Road and Amity Road. The southeastern corner is created by an intersection between Roseville Road and the Lackawanna Cut-off. The Roseville Mine was first excavated in the early 1850s. It was well worked during its life, with production in 1880 alone documented as 67,000 tons of ore. Most of the work was done via a large open cut. This cut as it exists today, is water-filled, with vertical walls as much as high. The Charlotte Uranium mine extracted uranium from the rocks of southwestern Byram. The mine closed in the 1950s, but many remnants are still visible.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 22.72 square miles (58.84 km2), including 21.53 square miles (55.76 km2) of land and 1.19 square miles (3.07 km2) of water (5.22%). It is divided into several sections. They include the neighborhoods of Forest West, East and West Brookwood, Forest Lakes, Lackawanna, Cranberry Lake, and the Lake Mohawk area.

The township is known as the &quot;Township of Lakes&quot; because of the community&#x27;s nearly two dozen lakes and ponds.

A wooded exclave owned by the State of New Jersey and covering is located on Lake Musconetcong adjoining Hopatcong and Stanhope, away from the remainder of the township.

Byram Center (with a 2010 Census population of 90) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Byram Township. Lake Mohawk (with 1,824 out of the CDP&#x27;s total 2010 Census population of 9,916 in the township) is a CDP split between Byram Township and Sparta Township.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Brookwood East, Brookwood West, Cage Hill, Cranberry Lake, Forest Lakes, Jefferson Lake, Lake Lackawanna, Lockwood, Panther Pond, Roseville, Stag Pond, Tomahawk Lane, Waterloo, Wolf Lake and Wrights Pond.

<text>Frankford Township is a township in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 5,302, a decrease of 263 (−4.7%) from the 2010 census count of 5,565, which in turn reflected an increase of 145 (+2.7%) from the 5,420 counted in the 2000 census.

Frankford Township was formed on April 10, 1797, from portions of Newton Township, and was incorporated on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature. Portions of the township were taken to form Lafayette Township and Sparta Township (both established on April 14, 1845), along with Branchville (March 9, 1898), which is completely surrounded by the township. The township was said to have been named after Frankford, a neighborhood of Philadelphia, after a visitor who hailed from that area came to help out at the rural school in the township.

Since 1976, the township has been the home of the Farm and Horse Show, which expanded after it was relocated from Branchville. The New Jersey State Fair / Sussex County Farm &amp; Horse Show has evolved as the site of numerous activities and events throughout the year. The township&#x27;s Skylands Park, a 4,300-seat baseball park, was home to the New Jersey Cardinals of the New York–Penn League from 1993 to 2005, and the Sussex Skyhawks of the Can-Am League from 2006 to 2010. Since 2005, the stadium is the home of the Sussex County Miners, which plays as part of the Frontier League.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 35.30 square miles (91.42 km2), including 33.88 square miles (87.74 km2) of land and 1.42 square miles (3.68 km2) of water (4.02%). Culver&#x27;s Lake and Lake Owassa, two natural lakes nestled below the Kittatinny Mountain, form the northern border. The township is located in the Kittatinny Valley which is a section of the long Great Appalachian Valley that stretches from Canada to Alabama.

The borough of Branchville is completely surrounded by Frankford Township, making it part of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another. The township borders the Sussex County municipalities of Hampton Township, Lafayette Township, Sandyston Township and Wantage Township.

Ross Corner (with a 2010 Census population of 13) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Frankford Township. Augusta is another unincorporated community located within the township. Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Armstrong, Culvers Gap, Culvers Inlet, Culvers Lake, Lake Owassa, Mount Pisgah, Northrup, Pallettown, Pellettown, Plains and Wykertown.

==History==

===Geology===
Most of Frankford Township is on the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation. This is a shale, slate, and limestone formation created 450 million years ago when a chain of volcanic islands collided with proto North America. This is a dark, almost black, shale. However the Jacksonburg formation rides over the Martinsburg shale in most areas. This shale is silver in color in the inside of the shale.

The islands went over the North American plate, creating the Highlands of Sussex County. The Kittatinny Valley was uplifted. The sediment at the bottom of seas was uplifted and formed shale. Millions of years of erosion occurred and there was a second event. About 400 million years ago small continent that was long and thin, collided with proto North America creating folding and faulting. The Silurian Shawnangunk conglomerate that was under a shallow sea, lifted due to pressure. The pressure created heat which melted the silica, bonded the quartz and conglomerate together, creating Kittatinny Mountain.

The Wisconsin Glacier covered all of the township from 21,000 BCE to 13,000 BCE. The glacier covered the top of Kittatinny Mountain. End moraines exist in Stokes State Forest as well as just off County Route 565 north of the Skylands Park. Also about a mile south of Ross&#x27;s Corner is an end moraine. An esker was created when the glacier retreated due to climate warming. Many ponds and lakes created. Culver Lake was created at this time, as the drainage became blocked. The township is drained by two river systems. The Paulinskill and the Wallkill. The Paulinskill travels in a northwesterly direction throughout the township before turning southwest. Papakatkin Creek starts east of Branchville Reservoir and drains into the Wallkill River north of the town of Sussex. Another creek starts near the base of Sunrise Mountain and empties into the Papakatkin Creek near Pellettown. Dry Creek starts at the Branchville Reservoir, travels south and enters into Culver&#x27;s Creek in Branchville; eventually empties into the Paulinskill. There is a chain of hills between Dry Creek and Papakatin Creek. These hills are what separate the two river drainage systems. The drainage divide is just north of Route 206 and the goes northwest toward Branchville Reservoir. Water near Route 206 or south of Route 206 drains into the Paulinskill. Water north of Route 206 drains into the Wallkill River.

Culvers Gap was made by an ancient stream that was later diverted. The gap&#x27;s bottom is below the top of Kittatinny Mountain, which can be seen for many miles.

===Paleo Indians===
After the glacier melted, the area was cold and wet. The area was a Tundra Biome which grasses grew slowly. This is when Paleo Indians came into the area around 11,000 BCE. After several thousand years, the area became warmer. As the climate warmed, vegetation patterns changed. With change in plant life, herbivore megafauna slowly died out. Or were concentrated in certain areas which allowed for over hunting by Paleo-Indians. Coniferous forests of spruce and pine began to grow. The area then became a Taiga Biome. Paleo Indians carried spears with fluted points made of black chert or jasper. They used Culver&#x27;s Gap to travel from the Flatbrook Valley to the Kittatinny Valley. This route was later used by Native Americans. Paleo Indians made temporary camps and traveled often as they were hunter gatherers. It is difficult to locate their camps as they are located many feet below the present ground surface of today. One would have to search the Pleistocene gravels.

Mastodons, Musk Ox and Caribou roamed the area. The bones of Mastodons were found in Highland Lakes, Swartswood Lake, Great Meadows, and in Orange County, New York. As climate warmed, megafauna either traveled north, were over hunted, or became extinct due to lack of food.

Climate warmed between 8000 BCE to 6000 BCE. At this time more deciduous trees such as oak, maple, birch, and willows began to grow. Other big game then slowly inhabited the area, such as deer, elk, bear, and moose.

By 3000 BCE other deciduous trees grew such as hickory, cherry, walnut, beech, butternut, chestnut, ash and elm. Hunter gatherers populations slowly grew as now there was more food in the forests. The Paulinskill River is shallow which allowed for easy fishing. The valley has small hills which allowed for easy travel and setting up camps. Due to the diversity of the deciduous trees and plants growing in the grasslands, game was everywhere. Gathering became more intensive.

Around 1000 BCE, clay pottery was invented which allowed the storage of seeds, nuts and other food. The bow and arrow was also invented around this time. Hunter gatherer populations began to rise more due to the ability to store nuts in pottery and procure game through the bow and arrow. However camps were still temporary and traveling was still done often in search of game and plants. As populations grew, camps became more seasonal. These camps were along rivers. It was at this time that the Lenape Native Americans entered the area from the west.

===Lenape Native Americans===
The Lenape settled this area around 1000 BCE or slightly later. They settled their seasonal extended family camps along the river valleys as food and water was abundant there. They had a trade route that went through the township. The path started at Minisink Island on the Delaware and went to Raritan Bay. The path went from Minisink Island to Culver&#x27;s Gap, and continued through Frankford Twp. where it crossed the Paulinskill River and went south, east of Newton.
Around the year 800 CE to 1000 CE, triangular projectile points were developed. This was the beginning of the bow and arrow in North America. It was also at this time around the year 1000 CE that agriculture began to be developed along with clay pottery. With potter, the bow and arrow, along with agriculture; Native American populations grew even more. The Lenape were still hunter gatherers and supplemented their procuring of wild game with corn, beans and squash. They had gardens that were round or oval in fertile river valleys. 
The Paulinskill River and the surrounding valley offered excellent area for family camps of Native Americans. The Paulinskill River is shallow and narrow which allowed for easy fishing, bathing, and gathering of plants. Game also is attracted to the river valley such as deer, bear, waterfowl and other small game. Since the land is flat, this allowed for easy traveling, hunting and food gathering such as various nuts. 
Culvers Lake was the site of Native American villages and Papakating Creek was used as a campsite.
Many trees were huge, which allowed for large nut crops each autumn. The Native American populations continued to grow even though they were living in a late Stone Age culture. Populations expanded until the Little Ice Age and European arrival.

===The Little Ice Age and European contact===
The Little Ice Age began in the early 17th century and ended in the mid 19th century. In the late 17th century is when Europeans came into contact with the Lenape Native Americans in this area. The Little Ice Age had to have a drastic effect on Native American populations in this area. The area had late frosts in June and early frosts in August. This would have had not only an effect on corn crops, but on hunting game as well for the Native Americans. Corn took longer to grow than the corn farmers grow today. Trees bearing nuts such as Oak, Hickory, Beech, Walnut, Butternut, and Chestnut would have reduced nut crops by cold weather. Game animals tend to go into a semi hibernation during cold spells which would make game more difficult to find. Extreme cold weather and deep snow also made finding game difficult. Shallow rivers such as the Paulinskill and Wallkill froze quickly, thus reducing the ability to fish. Due to these factors many Native Americans starved in this area.

Native Americans had no immunity to European diseases because of separation from Europe and Asia for thousands of years made them vulnerable to European diseases. Because Native Americans traveled and traded with each other, getting smallpox was not that difficult. Population of Native Americans perished because of this also. The Native populations decreased during the late 17th century and early 18th century in Frankford Township and the rest of New Jersey due to disease.

By 1750 nearly all the Native Americans were gone from this area. This was due to land patents, disease from Europeans, and starvation from several hundred years of the Little Ice Age.

===Early European settlement===
The first permanent settlement of European settlers in the township probably happened around 1699. At that time, this area was part of Burlington County. In 1713 this area was part of Hunterdon County, as Hunterdon separated from Burlington. Later the area was included in Morris County when it separated from Hunterdon County.
The land was flat with fresh water from the Paulinskill, Dry Creek or Papakatkin Creek. A Quaker meeting house was established in 1700 near Papakating Creek near Plains Road. Settlers may have been here as early as 1699. Soil was fertile for farming. Huge trees in virgin forests were everywhere. Game, fish and waterfowl were abundant. The land was cleared for farming. The forests were slowly cut down with axes. Fire was used to clear land. The area was still cold due to the Little Ice Age so farming progressed slowly. Colonists raised pigs, chickens, sheep, and cattle brought from Europe. Apples trees were also planted. The area was controlled by England and part of Morris County at this time.

Settlers came from New York State by way of the Wallkill River drainage or by route through Culver&#x27;s Gap. The Highlands to the east were difficult to cross.

===French and Indian War===
George Washington started the French and Indian war at the battle of Jumonville Glen on May 28, 1754 in southwestern Pennsylvania by killing French soldiers and a French diplomate Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville. At that time, Frankford Township was near the edge of the frontier and settlers just west of the township were being attacked by Native Americans. Farms and houses were burned; settlers killed. Many colonists moved east to be safe. Eight fortified houses were built from Phillipsburg, New Jersey to Port Jervis, New York along the Delaware River. Native Americans sided with the French due to being treated unfairly by the English, such as the Walking Purchase of 1737 and land patents. The Native Americans did not understand how the English viewed land possession.

<text>Franklin is a borough in Sussex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,912, a decrease of 133 (−2.6%) from the 2010 census count of 5,045, which in turn reflected a decline of 115 (−2.2%) from the 5,160 counted in the 2000 census.

Franklin, known as the &quot;Fluorescent Mineral Capital of the World,&quot; is located over a rich ore body containing more than 150 minerals, many of them fluorescent and 25 of which are found nowhere else on earth. Settled in the 17th century, the village known as Franklin Furnace after Benjamin Franklin, developed near iron mines and iron smelting operations located along the Wallkill River. In the early 19th century, zinc deposits in the area began to be developed commercially. For most of the century many small companies mined zinc and iron in the Franklin area. In 1897 all zinc mining efforts merged into the New Jersey Zinc Company, which was a major controlling factor in the development of Franklin. Immigrants from Russia, Britain, Hungary and Poland joined the work force at the mine. The population, 500 in 1897, had swelled to 3,000 by 1913. On March 18, 1913, the Borough of Franklin was incorporated from portions of Hardyston Township, based on the results of a referendum held on April 23, 1913.
