In 1915, a moose visited the town regularly and in the book, &quot;Honk, the Moose&quot;, the residents named him &quot;Honk&quot; after the noise he made. This children&#x27;s book &quot;Honk, the Moose&quot;, was written by famed author, Phil Stong and illustrated by Kurt Weise. Stong was a teacher and coach at the Biwabik school in the 1919–1920 school year. He featured people from Biwabik as characters. The book is a Newbery Honor and on Cattermole&#x27;s 100 Best Children&#x27;s Books of the 20th Century. A statue of Honk resides in the city park on Main Street.

<doc id="121725" wikidata="Q2333965" url="?curid=121725" title="Chisholm, Minnesota">
<text>Chisholm is a city in St. Louis County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 4,775 at the 2020 census. The city has been called &quot;The Heart of the Iron Range&quot; due to its location in the middle of the Mesabi Iron Range.

==History==
The city was named for its founder, Archibald Mark Chisholm (1862–1933), a mining man and investor from Glengarry County, Ontario, Canada. Chisholm was incorporated in 1901. A post office called Chisholm has been in operation since 1901. With a railroad line to Duluth and plenty of mining work available in and near town, Chisholm&#x27;s population grew rapidly, and by 1908 it had more than 6,000 people and 500 buildings. On September 5, 1908, a fast-moving forest fire obliterated the town due to dry conditions and the wooden construction of nearly all the town&#x27;s buildings. Many people escaped by going into the lake. No one died in the fire. Afterward, building codes were enhanced, and by the next summer more than 70 fireproof buildings had been erected.

Chisholm became a city in 1934.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===
Located in the Iron Range region, Chisholm experienced significant change throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries, reflecting the booms and busts of the iron mining industry. The 1930s were a challenging time for Chisholm. The Great Depression impacted iron ore demand, leading to mine closures and unemployment. Workers faced labor unrest and strikes. World War II brought renewed demand for iron ore, reviving Chisholm&#x27;s economy.

Muralist Elizabeth Carney Pope completed a Works Progress Administration (WPA) mural, &quot;Discovery of Ore&quot;, in the Chisholm post office in 1941.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
The 1970s saw a decline in iron ore prices and a shift to foreign competition. Mines in and near Chisholm began closing again, resulting in job losses and population decline. The city grappled with economic diversification efforts.

=== 1990s to current ===
The late 20th and early 21st centuries brought continued adjustments. Tourism and healthcare emerged as new economic sectors. Chisholm focused on preserving its mining history and revitalizing its downtown area. Chisholm maintains a strong connection to its iron mining past. The Minnesota Museum of Mining and the Minnesota Discover Center interpret the region&#x27;s mining history, and the city hosts festivals and events celebrating its heritage.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water.

Chisholm is in the center of the Mesabi Iron Range, one of the four iron ranges in Minnesota&#x27;s Arrowhead Region.

U.S. Highway 169 and State Highway 73 (MN 73) are two of Chisholm&#x27;s main routes.

<doc id="121728" wikidata="Q207660" url="?curid=121728" title="Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle">
<text>Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle (; 10 May 1760 – 26 June 1836) was a French army officer of the French Revolutionary Wars. Lisle is known for writing the words and music of the , which would later be known as and become the French national anthem.

==Early life==
Rouget de Lisle was born at Lons-le-Saunier, reputedly on a market day. His parents lived in the neighbouring village of Montaigu. A plaque was placed at the precise spot of his birth and a statue erected in the town&#x27;s center in 1882. He was the eldest son of Claude Ignace Rouget (5 April 1735 – 6 August 1792) at Orgelet and Jeanne Madeleine Gaillande (2 July 1734 – 20 March 1811).

In 1784, he was initiated into &quot;Les Frères discrets&quot;, a masonic lodge in Charleville, just after being promoted officer.

==Career==

He enlisted into the army as an engineer and attained the rank of captain. A royalist like his father, he refused to take the oath of allegiance to the new constitution. Rouget de Lisle was cashiered and thrown into prison in 1793, narrowly escaping the guillotine. He was freed during the Thermidorian Reaction and retired to Montague.

===La Marseillaise===

The song that has immortalized him, &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, was composed at Strasbourg, where Rouget de Lisle was garrisoned in April 1792. However, another composition with the same tune was composed 11 years before by the Italian composer Giovan Battista Viotti at the court of Marie Antoinette. France had just declared war on Austria, and the mayor of Strasbourg and worshipful master of the local masonic lodge, baron Philippe-Frédéric de Dietrich, held a dinner for the officers of the garrison, at which he lamented that France had no national anthem. Rouget de Lisle returned to his quarters and wrote the words in a fit of patriotic excitement. The piece was at first called (&quot;War Song for the Army of the Rhine&quot;) and only received its name of &quot;Marseillaise&quot; from its adoption by the Provençal volunteers whom Barbaroux introduced into Paris and who were prominent in the storming of the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792.

After the war, Rouget de Lisle wrote a few other songs of the same kind as the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;, and in 1825 he published &quot;Chants français&quot; (&quot;French Songs&quot;) in which he set to music fifty poems by various authors. His &quot;Essais en vers et en prose&quot; (&quot;Essays in Verse and Prose&quot;, 1797) contains the &quot;Marseillaise&quot;; a prose tale &quot;Adelaide et Monville&quot; of the sentimental kind; and some occasional poems. He returned to public life after the July Revolution and was awarded the Legion of Honour by Louis Philippe I.

==Death==

Rouget de Lisle died in poverty in Choisy-le-Roi, Val de Marne. His mortal remains were transferred from Choisy-le-Roi cemetery to the Invalides on 14 July 1915, during World War I.

<doc id="121736" wikidata="Q514934" url="?curid=121736" title="Ely, Minnesota">
<text>Ely ( ) is a city in St. Louis County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 3,268 at the 2020 census.

Located on the Vermilion iron range, Ely once had several iron ore mines. It is an entry point for campers and canoers into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Canada&#x27;s Quetico Provincial Park wilderness area. The International Wolf Center and the North American Bear Center are nearby.

Ely&#x27;s main street has nature outfitters, outdoor clothing stores, and restaurants. MN 1, MN 169, and County Road 21 (Central Avenue) are Ely&#x27;s main routes. The city is south of the Canadian border and is within the Superior National Forest.

==History==
The first Europeans to explore the area were fur traders who made their way into the wilderness in search of furs. But it was the Lake Vermillion gold rush that brought the first large numbers of pioneers to the area in 1865. Although hardly any gold was ever found, it was discovered that the area did contain large deposits of iron ore. Thousands of new immigrants were arriving in America at that time, and many of them came to the area later known as the Minnesota Iron Range, looking for work.

When the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway laid tracks extending the rails from Tower to Ely in 1888, Ely began mining operations with the opening of the Chandler Mine. Ore was shipped by rail to docks on Lake Superior in Two Harbors and Duluth. From there it was shipped by lake freighter for processing in Ashtabula and other points in Ohio.

That year the miners incorporated the town of Florence, population 177, near the east side of Shagawa Lake on a site now known as Spaulding. Florence was named after the daughter of the Chandler mine&#x27;s Captain Jack Pengilly (also the town&#x27;s first mayor). After ore was discovered farther west, the town relocated, changing its name as well. Since it was discovered that the name &quot;Florence&quot; was already used by another village in Minnesota, &quot;Ely&quot; was chosen in honor of mining executive Samuel B. Ely, a big promoter of Vermilion Range ore who lived in Michigan. (He is not known to have visited his namesake town.) In 2020, &quot;The Ely Echo&quot; wrote: 
:The name Ely stems from the &quot;Isle of Eels,&quot; a wetlands near Cambridge, England. In historic times,those lakes swarmed with the slithery fish (similar to eelpout) that provided sustenance for ancestors of Samuel B. Ely. His clan arrived in the states (from Ely, England) in the 1600s (one ancestor was a close associate of George Washington). Samuel, a mining executive, financed the railroad to Ely in 1888 which launched our town. He embraced Ojibwe culture and applied native names to some of his mining projects, including Ontonagon (hunting river) &amp; Ishpeming (heaven), Michigan. Samuel&#x27;s great grandson, Courtland Ely III, was Grand Marshal at Ely&#x27;s 1988 Centennial Parade, stayed with Schurkes at Wintergreen &amp; was given keys to the city by Gov. Rudy Perpich (an Iron Ranger from Hibbing).

The original town site consisted of 40 acres. A man named McCormick opened the first grocery store in a small log building. A. J. Fenske built the first frame building in the fall of 1887; he also opened a hardware and furniture store. The Pioneer Hotel was also built that year at the corner of Sheridan Street and Fourth Avenue. The first school opened in 1889 in a small frame building on Second Avenue; its enrollment was 112 during the first season.

According to a history written in 1910, &quot;The first religious service was conducted by Father Buh, who came from Tower for that purpose, and the Catholic congregation erected the first church. The first Protestant minister was Rev. Mr. Freeman, who arrived in time to hold an Easter service in 1889, and located here permanently, organizing the Presbyterian church. There are now six churches, representing as many different faiths.

Soon other mines opened in Ely: The Pioneer Mine (1889), the Zenith (1892), the Savoy (1899), and the Sibley (1899). The Pioneer was by far the most productive, producing 41 million tons or 40% of the Vermilion Range&#x27;s entire output. Eventually 11 mines opened near Ely. In 1967 the Pioneer mine closed. It is on the National Register of Historic Places and its offices house the Ely Arts &amp; Heritage Center.

Originally the mining was an open-pit operation, but when the abundant ore was mined out, deep shafts were made to start mining underground. With the need for wooden support beams to keep the tunnels from collapsing and for lumber to meet the needs of the ever-expanding growth in the area, the logging and milling industries grew. Logging continues in the region, though on a limited scale and only for paper pulp—the major operations virtually disappeared by 1920 when the area&#x27;s tree reserves were depleted.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water.

Ely is north of Duluth, 117 miles southeast of International Falls, and north of the Twin Cities.

===Environment===
====Copper mining controversy====
Since the 1960s, as Iron Range mines began closing, leaving only a few in operation, Ely, like many northern Minnesota communities, faced economic decline. Duluth, on the shores of Lake Superior, has built a tourist trade that has helped to sustain its economy. Ely, seen as the gateway to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, has also developed a lively tourist trade, but due to environmental concerns the area has recently seen controversy about a proposal to build a mining operation for copper just outside the BWCAW. The company involved, Twin Metals Minnesota, is operated by a Chilean company, Antofagasta PLC. It says it plans &quot;to build modern mines that must go through a rigorous regulatory process before they can move forward&quot;, but environmentalists are concerned that runoff from the mining operation could damage the BWCA wilderness area. The copper deposits beneath the forests and lakes of northeastern Minnesota are encased in sulfide ore and when that is exposed it produces sulfuric acid, which has resulted in severe water pollution in copper mines in several western U.S. areas.

In October 2021, the Biden administration filed an application for a &quot;mineral withdrawal&quot; that will put a hold on the development of the mine proposal while the environmental impacts are studied. The Obama administration had launched a similar study, but 24 weeks into the 28-week study the newly elected Trump administration ended it, allowing the plans for the mining operation to continue. The completed study could lead to a 20-year ban on mining upstream from the BWCAW. The Trump mineral leases were judged illegal, and in January 2022 the Biden administration canceled two Twin Metals mineral leases. The &quot;Timberjay&quot; called the Biden administration&#x27;s decision a &quot;potentially fatal blow to [a] proposed copper-nickel mine.&quot;

===Climate===

On the Köppen climate classification, Ely falls in the warm summer humid continental climate zone (&quot;Dfb&quot;). Summertime is warm (sometimes hot) and wintertime is cold (sometimes severely) and drawn out, sometimes beginning in October and lasting well into April.

On February 13, 2021, Ely set a new daily record low for the city with an actual air temperature of -50F. This compares to the Minnesota record low temperature of -60F recorded near the town of Tower, MN on February 2, 1996.

Ely&#x27;s post office contains two tempera-on-plaster murals, &quot;Iron-Ore Mines&quot; and &quot;Wilderness&quot;, painted by Elsa Jemne in 1941. Federally commissioned post office murals were produced during the New Deal through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department.
===North American Bear Center===

Ely is home to the North American Bear Center, which opened in 2007. It is an interactive museum and educational facility featuring American black bears. The center, the only science/nature museum of its kind, is dedicated to helping people learn from the bears themselves about bear behavior, ecology, and their relations with humans. A wall of windows overlooks a 2.5-acre naturally forested enclosure with a pond and waterfalls, which is home to four resident bears. There are also exhibits, a theater, children&#x27;s activities, and interpretive nature trails.

===International Wolf Center===

The International Wolf Center is one of the world&#x27;s leading organizations dedicated to educating people about wolves. Founded in 1985 by a group of biologists led by L. David Mech, a world-renowned wolf biologist, it opened in 1993. The center features gray wolves viewable through large windows that allow visitors to watch them communicate, play, hunt and eat. In addition to the onsite ambassador wolves, the center offers a variety of educational programs at its Ely interpretive facility and other locations in northern Minnesota and across North America. Afternoon, weekend and weeklong programs include howling trips, radio tracking, snowshoe treks, family activities, dogsledding, videos, presentations, flights over wolf country, demonstrations, and hikes.

===Arts &amp; Heritage Center===
The Ely Arts &amp; Heritage Center is in the historic Pioneer Mine complex. It is managed by a nonprofit arts organization, Ely Greenstone Public Art. It offers classes, exhibits, and festivals.

===Dorothy Molter museum===

The Dorothy Molter cabin and museum are in Ely. Known as the &quot;Root Beer Lady&quot;, Molter lived for 56 years on Knife Lake in the BWCAW. She gradually gained national prominence and extensive coverage in media, books and documentaries, and over the years tens of thousands of canoeists stopped by to visit and drink her homemade root beer. Molter was born May 6th, 1907 in Pennsylvania, but was quickly separated from her family and raised in an orphanage. She first visited her future home (The Isle of Pines Resort) on Knife Lake in 1930 and it became her home in 1934 after falling in love with the area. Until the mid/late 1940s, the Isle of Pines resort was typical of many north woods resorts. It was reachable by seaplanes and motorboats, and later by snowmobiles as they came into use.

After a 1949 flight ban Molter began importing her supplies for root beer by boat and reusing glass bottles that she stored in a shed. Canoeists stopping by would be asked to bring supplies from town and would commonly leave an oar behind, hundreds of which are still on display at the museum. Molter&#x27;s land was taken from her in the 1964 Wilderness Act, however, after a nationwide uproar and her friends protesting, she was allowed to temporarily stay as long as the resort was closed down. Along with Molters land being taken, nearly all motorized transportation to Molter&#x27;s lodge was eliminated, residences, buildings, business and the few roads from the wilderness were removed, leaving Molter as the only full-time resident in a wilderness area three times the size of Rhode Island. Later she was given a lifetime pardon to live in her home. After her death, her multiple cabins, all her belongings, and other parts of her residence were dismantled and moved to Ely by boat. They were all then reconstructed there, and the Dorothy Molter Museum was established, and to this day sells her root beer to preserve her legacy.

=== Ely-Winton History Museum ===
The Ely-Winton History Museum is on the Vermilion Community College Campus. It depicts local history through displays, photographs, and oral histories. Logging and mining histories are told using geological samples and old logging and mining tools. Examples of past businesses are demonstrated as well as the importance of women on the frontier. In 2018 the museum opened an exhibit of paintings representative of Ely mining history, featuring the works of Albin Zaverl. It also has a collection of the work done by Ojibwe artist Carl Gawboy, who grew up in Ely. The museum offers programs about the history of the area twice a month during the summer. The museum mission statement reads:

:The mission depicts local history through artifacts, photographs, oral histories, numerous videos/DVDs; displays include Ojibwe, fur trade, mining, logging, immigration, voyageurs, and Footprints Across The Wilderness, the history of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness with a new exhibit each summer. They cover the history of the area from prehistoric times through mining, immigration and logging. Arts displays include Carl Gawboy and Albin Zaverl.

===Historically significant structures in and around Ely===

The U.S. National Register of Historic Places deems certain structures worthy of preservation for their historical significance. Several sites in and around Ely have been placed on the Register&#x27;s list: Bull-of-the-Woods Logging Scow, Ely State Theater, Listening Point, and Tanner&#x27;s Hospital.

Listening Point was the private retreat of conservationist Sigurd Olson on Burntside Lake. Olson acquired the property in 1956, then purchased a log cabin and a log sauna elsewhere that he had dismantled, moved to Listening Point, and reassembled. In 1998 the Listening Point Foundation was organized to preserve the property as an open-air museum to Olson.

The Ely State Theater is a 1936 Streamline Moderne design, epitomizing the small-town commissions of leading regional theater designers, Minneapolis architects Liebenberg &amp; Kaplan.

Tanner&#x27;s Hospital is a former hospital building built in 1901 as a moneymaking enterprise due to the area&#x27;s high disease rate, a consequence of low investment in sanitation infrastructure in the mining boom towns of the Iron Range, where the long-term existence of any given community was unpredictable.

The Bull-of-the-Woods Logging Scow is a small paddle steamer wrecked in Burntside Lake. It was built around 1893 for one of the lumber companies in the area. There were at least a few of these vessels, locally known as &quot;alligators&quot; or &quot;gators&quot;, in operation in northeastern Minnesota in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They could tow timber rafts, hoist logs, navigate shallow waters, and even pull themselves across dry land. It is the only known surviving example of its type.

==Parks and recreation==
There are many Minnesota wilderness hiking trails in the Ely area. Echo Trail (Saint Louis County Road 116), considered one of Minnesota&#x27;s most scenic trails, is a former logging road that runs north and west out of Ely and provides the primary access to the lakes of the western BWCAW. The trail is a 72-mile (116-km) road on asphalt and gravel through the wilderness of the Superior National Forest and Kabetogama State Forest.

Trezona Trail offers historic views of the old iron ore mining operations that first brought new immigrants to the area.

The Kekekabic Trail, commonly called &quot;The Kek&quot;, is a hiking trail that runs about 39 miles, beginning in Ely and ending at the Gunflint Trail.

A paved biking trail, the Mesabi Trail, begins in Ely and stretches across the Mesabi Iron Range ending in Grand Rapids, a distance of approximately 120 miles.

In 2015, the Ely Marathon began, sending runners from the north side of Burntside Lake down the Echo Trail and into the city. It has become an annual event and grown to include several races. The marathon is known as the world&#x27;s only marathon with a &quot;canoe portage&quot; category and holds the world record time for a marathon-length canoe portage.

===Attractions===
Ely is the largest &quot;jumping off&quot; town for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and a major one for Quetico Provincial Park. The BWCAW is renowned as a destination for canoeing and fishing on its many lakes, and is the nation&#x27;s most-visited wilderness. With extensive outfitting and other services, Ely can credibly be claimed to do the most wilderness canoe outfitting of any town or city in the world.

Longtime Ely resident Sigurd F. Olson was instrumental in creating the BWCAW. A writer, environmentalist, and advocate for the protection of wilderness, he served for more than 30 years as a wilderness guide in the lakes and forests of the Quetico-Superior country of northern Minnesota and southwestern Ontario. He worked for the protection of the Boundary Waters, helped draft the Wilderness Act of 1964, and helped establish Voyageurs National Park in northern Minnesota. He was known honorifically as &quot;the Bourgeois&quot;—a term the voyageurs used for trusted leaders.

=== Outfitters ===
Ely Minnesota is considered to be one of the main gateways to the American side of the BWCAW. Because of this it is estimated that 250,000 people visit Ely Minnesota a year to enter the backcountry . To handle all of the people, Ely houses 20 outfitters. Outfitters are companies that provide gear and information for visitors because not everyone can afford or store their own gear, nor do they know all the information necessary. Some specialize in shorter day trips, some do weeks long, and some even provide guides.

===Camp Widjiwagan===
Camp Widjiwagan is a wilderness camp for girls and boys on Burntside Lake. The camp is nationally recognized for its canoeing and backpacking programs; it also has an environmental education program, the Widjiwagan Outdoor Learning Program. During the summer it runs canoe and backpacking programs offered at several degrees of experience, with more advanced trips for experienced campers. Environmental education programs are held during the fall, winter and spring, with students studying wilderness survival, plant and tree identification, basic hiking skills, animal tracking, the night sky, snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing. Master builder of wood-and-canvas canoes Joe Seliga lived in Ely and was an instructor at the camp. When he died in 2005, Camp Widjiwagan received his canoe form.

===Hegman Lake pictographs===

The Hegman Lake Pictographs, within the BWCAW about 15 miles north of Ely, have been called &quot;perhaps the most visited and photogenic pictograph within the State of Minnesota.&quot; On a large overlooking rock wall on North Hegman Lake, this ancient rock art is believed to have been created by the Ojibwe. The painting&#x27;s meaning is uncertain. It appears to represent the Ojibwe meridian constellations visible in winter during the early evening. While some anthropologists believe the pictographs may have served as a guide for navigating in the deep woods during the winter hunting season, others see it as a visual representation of the connection between the spiritual and temporal worlds. In the summer the site can be reached only by canoe. In the winter, when the lakes are frozen, it can be reached by foot, with snowshoes if the snow is deep.

==Education==
The Ely Public School District includes two public schools: Ely Memorial High School (Grades 6–12) and Washington Elementary School (Grades Pre-K-5). Ely is home to Minnesota North College – Vermilion, formerly named Vermilion Community College.

Ely has a public library, the Ely Public Library, which is part of the Arrowhead Library System. Originally housed in the Ely Community Center, the library moved to a new, separate facility in 2014.

==Media==
Ely is served by two community-oriented newspapers, the &quot;Ely Echo&quot; and the &quot;North Country Angler&quot;, and a radio station, WELY.

==Notable people==
* Jessica Biel – actress, born in Ely
* Thomas A. Brown (1889–1959) – notoriously corrupt police chief of St. Paul, Minnesota, during both Prohibition and the Public Enemies era. Infamous as a conspirator in multiple felonies committed by the Dillinger Gang and the Barker-Karpis Gang. After successfully evading prosecution, Brown settled in Ely as a liquor store owner.
* Jim Brandenburg – photographer with &quot;National Geographic&quot;
* Jim Klobuchar – journalist, father of U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar
* Lynn Rogers – black bear expert
* Patrick Roger Vail - Minnesota politician and businessman

==Famous hoaxes==
People from Ely, with the support (and often assistance) of the city council, have created various hoaxes as a way of garnering free publicity for the city. One was that of a fictional family that &quot;paints the leaves&quot; of trees every fall. The fictional family was retiring from the business, and wanted people to send in a &quot;color application&quot; if they wanted to help carry out the tradition. Previously, a story was released about Ely seceding from the United States to be part of Canada. Both hoaxes were featured on Ely&#x27;s Chamber Of Commerce website, www.ely.org.

In 2009, Ely made a tongue-in-cheek international bid to host the 2016 Olympics, with a man allegedly already employed with a bucket to drain Miner&#x27;s Lake south of town in order to provide stadium seating. This hoax became widely known throughout Minnesota, and was often reported on radio stations. Shirts, bumper stickers, signs, and even interstate billboards bearing the slogan &quot;Ely in 2016&quot; became commonplace throughout the state.

==Economy==
Eveleth is on the Mesabi Range, one of sub-regions of Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range. The town&#x27;s economy has always been tied to the iron ore mining and processing. This activity peaked during World War II and declined through the second half of the 20th century. A demand for iron ore occurred between 2005 and 2007, and local economies experienced a mild improvement due to improved mining productivity, which allowed demand to be met with only a modest increase in staffing.

Within Eveleth&#x27;s city limits is Thunderbird Mine, where crude iron ore is processed into 5.5 million tons of iron ore taconite pellets per year. The ore is magnetite-bearing iron formation of the Paleoproterozoic Biwabik Iron Formation, and is crushed at the mine site and shipped by railroad to the Fairlane Plant in Forbes, Minnesota, for concentrating and pelletizing.

==Arts and culture==
===Landmarks===
Eveleth once had side-by-side water towers labeled &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;.

===In popular culture===
The feature films &quot;Wildrose&quot; (1984) and &quot;North Country&quot; (2005) were both shot in Eveleth.

===Hockey===

The United States Hockey Hall of Fame (not to be confused with the Hockey Hall of Fame, in Toronto) is in Eveleth. The city has long been noted as a powerhouse of hockey talent. It has won several state championships, most recently in 1998. During the 1950s the Eveleth Golden Bears dominated high school hockey in Minnesota, garnering a number of state records, including most consecutive state championships (4: 1948–51), most consecutive championship games (5: 1948–52) and most consecutive tournament appearances (12: 1945–56), despite the district&#x27;s tiny population.

Eveleth has the &quot;world&#x27;s largest authentic hockey stick&quot;, standing at 107 feet and weighing 3 tons. A few blocks away from the stick is the Eveleth Hippodrome, Minnesota&#x27;s oldest hockey arena still in use. The Rock Ridge Wolverines Boys &amp; Girls hockey teams play there as one out of two of their home rinks, the other being the Iron Trail Motors Event Center in Virginia.

The Eveleth Reds played in the United States Amateur Hockey Association between 1920 and 1925, and in the inaugural season of 1920–21 finished as runner-ups to the Cleveland Indians after losing a closely contested four-game series 12 goals to 14 in April 1921. Eveleth&#x27;s biggest star player was defenseman Ivan &quot;Ching&quot; Johnson, who played three seasons for the club between 1920 and 1923, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958.

<doc id="121743" wikidata="Q513404" url="?curid=121743" title="Floodwood, Minnesota">
<text>Floodwood is a city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 517 at the 2020 census.

Originally a logging community, Floodwood was a dairy community for most of its history, but could now be best described as a bedroom community, since most of its working population finds employment in nearby Duluth, Grand Rapids, Hibbing and Cloquet. The city calls itself &quot;The Catfish Capital of the World&quot;, a nickname it gave itself following the introduction of its annual Catfish Days festival.

U.S. Highway 2 and State Highway 73 (MN 73) are two of the main routes in Floodwood.

==History==
Long before the city of Floodwood existed, the intersection of the East Savanna River with the Saint Louis River made what later became Floodwood a strategic economic location. The Savanna Portage was a major route for transportation in the southern Arrowhead, but its importance was magnified greatly with the arrival of European fur traders, who used the route to access rich resources of beaver and other fur animals in the upper Mississippi valley. As early as 1679, Europeans were passing by the modern location of Floodwood as they turned from the Saint Louis River to the East Savanna River on their way to the portage.

It was not until the late 19th century that homesteads began to appear in the area. In 1889, it was announced that a railroad would pass through the area. This led to a local population boom in anticipation of the opportunities the railroad would bring. In 1890, J. C. Campbell began large-scale logging operations in the area, and the C. N. Nelson Lumber Company of Cloquet built a logging railroad in the area (the logging railroad operated only in the winter; in the summer, the logging operations used the Saint Louis River to transport timber to mills in Cloquet).

In 1893, the year that local government was first organized, the first Floodwood School building was constructed of logs. The next year, the Nelson Company was purchased by what six years later became the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company, continuing the intensification of logging activities in the area. The community continued to grow and was finally incorporated in 1899.

By the time the 1900 United States census was conducted, Floodwood had a population of 224, which, within the next 10 years, more than doubled to 481. In 1911, the Floodwood School, which had previously been a county school, became Independent School District No. 19 (after 1958, Independent School District 698), and a new six-room brick building was built for it. The community continued to grow until the 1918 Cloquet Fire nearly ended the city&#x27;s history.

Like most of its neighbors, Floodwood survived the fire and began a slow recovery. But the practical importance of the rivers, Floodwood&#x27;s greatest economic resource, ended. By 1926, the era of large-scale timber operations in the area had come to a close. With the logging operations gone, Floodwood&#x27;s survival was again in peril.

The solution had already been present since 1911: as the surrounding areas had pastures suitable for supporting dairy cattle, the community&#x27;s economy turned to dairy production. In 1911, the Floodwood Creamery Cooperative was organized. The creamery became the main support of the local economy, selling dairy products across the world until it closed in the late 1960s. Dairy cattle are still a major part of the local economy.

The 1970 census showed, for the first time since 1920, that Floodwood&#x27;s population had decreased. This began a trend that has endured to the present: the last time a census showed an increase in Floodwood&#x27;s population was in 1960.

==Geography==
 According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , all land.

Floodwood sits at the junction of U.S. Highway 2 and Minnesota State Highway 73. It is roughly halfway between Duluth and Grand Rapids along U.S. Highway 2 and roughly halfway between Hibbing and Moose Lake along State Highway 73. Also nearby is the city of Cloquet.

Floodwood is northwest of Duluth and southeast of Grand Rapids. It is northwest of Cloquet and south of Hibbing.

The city sits at the junctions of the Floodwood River and the East Savanna River with the Saint Louis River. The area surrounding the city largely comprises forests, wetlands and, where conditions permit, dairy farms. Nearby peat bogs employ many people from Floodwood, Meadowlands and other communities in southwest Saint Louis County. Protected areas near Floodwood include Savanna Portage State Park, the Savanna State Forest, and the Floodwood Game Reserve. The Savanna Portage, together with the three rivers that meet in the city, contributes much to local culture.
==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Floodwood has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Floodwood was on July 27, 1988, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 20, 1996.

==Government==
Floodwood has a mayor-council government and operates under the provisions of state statutes concerning city government (which is true of every Minnesota city that has no home-rule charter). The mayor is Dave Denoyer, who presides over meetings of the city council. The position of City Administrator, created in 2002 to handle the day-to-day operations of the city&#x27;s administration, is held by Jess Rich.

In May 2009, when city leaders from throughout Minnesota made the trek to the State Capitol, Mayor Kletscher made statewide news when he said: &quot;My toolbox is empty. We&#x27;ve been facing this for years. We&#x27;re a very poor city and we can&#x27;t afford to see tax rates go up.&quot; City leaders were arguing against cuts to state funding for communities in Governor Tim Pawlenty&#x27;s budget cuts. Kletscher, among others, argued that smaller communities did not have things like libraries that they could close to save funds and that the only way they could continue to function in the face of cuts in state funding would be to raise property taxes, which they did not want to do because residents of these communities are often poor, and they feared the burden would be too much for them to handle.

<text>Hermantown is a city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 10,221 at the 2020 census. A suburb of Duluth, it was at one point the county&#x27;s only city to grow in population, as much of the area&#x27;s residential and commercial expansion occurred there. Hermantown is near the tip of Lake Superior.

The eastern part of Hermantown has an appearance typical of a lower-density bedroom community, with large, leafy lots and occasional subdivisions. The car-oriented &quot;Miller Hill area&quot;, or Miller Trunk Corridor of Duluth, has sprawled well past the city boundary line into this part of Hermantown. The western part of Hermantown is more rural, reminiscent of the city&#x27;s past agricultural focus. Hermantown&#x27;s motto is &quot;The City of Quality Living&quot;.

Hermantown&#x27;s mayor is Wayne Boucher, who won a 2008 election against Susie Stockinger. Boucher ran unopposed for a second term in 2012 and received 4,111 votes; there were 79 write-ins.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the area were Native Americans. They lived in the area often called in early Duluth references &quot;the land up over the hill.&quot;

In 1867, August Kohlts and his friend Lambert &quot;Pat&quot; Acker filed for homesteads in Section 18, Township 50 North, Range 15 West. Both families had emigrated from Prussia. Acker arrived at about age five with his parents and siblings around 1835 and settled in Erie County, New York. He married Emelie Louisa Wilke on January 12, 1850. Kohlts and his wife, Emilie, immigrated in the spring of 1860. The Kohltses and Ackers resided in the town of Tonawanda on the Niagara River for some years with many other German settlers in the area. Citizenship was granted to Kohlts on March 20, 1868. Soon afterward, the Kohlts and Acker families set out from Buffalo, New York, heading west via the Great Lakes for the Hancock, Michigan, area of the Keweenaw Peninsula and its copper mines.

Perhaps lured by the availability of free land under the Homestead Act, the Kohlts family left for Minnesota. The federal census of June 1, 1870, records their presence in the Second Ward of the newly formed city of Duluth, while the Ackers arrived in Duluth in 1871. By January 1872, August Kohlts had established an 82-acre site in the wilderness outside Duluth. He and Acker were the first settlers in the area now known as Hermantown. The area was named for the Germanic chieftain known as Arminius or Herman.

In the years that followed, Kohlts and Acker alternated between working in Duluth and clearing land at their rural homesteads on what is now Five Corners Road in Hermantown. They traveled between Duluth and their homesteads on a Native American trail that later became Piedmont Avenue and the Hermantown Road.

Hermantown&#x27;s population got a boost from a new wave of homesteaders just before World War II. During the Great Depression, the federal government built nearly a hundred &quot;subsistence homestead&quot; projects designed to move people trapped in poverty in the cities to new homes in rural or suburban locations. One of the two Minnesota projects was assigned to Hermantown.

The Jackson Project was completed in 1937. It is one of Hermantown&#x27;s more interesting features, with a proliferation of &quot;Jackson Homes&quot; on certain roadways. These single-family dwellings were built during the Depression as subsistence homesteads. Many retain their original brick appearance, albeit with additions. Each of the 84 homesteads had a brick veneer farmhouse; half also had a garage-barn combination. Each had five or of land, and the family also received a pig, a cow, and 35 chickens. The idea was that the family would be able to raise its own food and use the profits from selling any surplus to work off its debt to the government. The units were sold to homesteaders on very liberal terms: the average price for the home and property was $2,687.40 plus interest.

The Jackson Project was one of the later projects built, which was a benefit because the quality of housing improved. Plumbing and electricity were now required in all homes. The homesteaders gave a new profile to what was then Herman Township. Now with 84 homes and families concentrated in one part of the community, the Project marked the start of Hermantown&#x27;s transition from rural to suburban.

Hermantown was incorporated as a city on December 31, 1975.

The community of Adolph is in Hermantown&#x27;s southwest corner.

<doc id="121754" wikidata="Q828736" url="?curid=121754" title="Hibbing, Minnesota">
<text>Hibbing is a city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 16,214 at the 2020 census. The city was built on mining the rich iron ore of the Mesabi Iron Range and still relies on that industrial activity today. At the edge of town is the world&#x27;s largest open-pit iron mine, the Hull–Rust–Mahoning Open Pit Iron Mine. It is the former hometown of singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, NBA Hall-of-Famer Kevin McHale, and former Governor of Minnesota Rudy Perpich.

The main routes in Hibbing are U.S. Highway 169, State Highway 37, State Highway 73, Howard Street, and 1st Avenue. It is about northwest of Duluth, Minnesota.

==History==
The town was founded in 1893 by Frank Hibbing, born in Walsrode, Germany on December 1, 1856, and christened Franz Dietrich von Ahlen. His mother died when he was still in infancy and it was her name, Hibbing, which he assumed when he set out to seek his fortune in the New World. He first settled in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, where he worked on a farm and in a shingle mill. Injured in a mill accident, he considered becoming a lawyer, but after deciding he was not familiar enough with the English language to make a legal career possible, he turned to timber cruising.

In 1887, Hibbing settled in Duluth where he established a real estate business and began explorations on the Vermilion Range. In 1892, he headed a party of thirty men at Mountain Iron and cut a road through the wilderness to Section 22, 58–20. An expert iron ore prospector, he soon discovered the surface indication which led him to believe in the existence of extensive ore deposits.

In July 1893, the townsite of Hibbing was laid out and named in honor of him. Feeling personally responsible, he took the deepest pride in its development and, by his generous aid, made its progress possible. He used his personal means to provide a water plant, electric light plant, the first roads, hotel, sawmill, and bank building. For the last ten years of his life, Hibbing made his home in Duluth, where many of his business interests were centered. He retained close contact with the community which bore his name, until he died of appendicitis on July 30, 1897, at age forty.

In 1914, two men, Carl Wickman and Andrew &quot;Bus Andy&quot; Anderson, started a bus line between Hibbing and Alice, Minnesota, which would eventually become Greyhound Lines, the world&#x27;s largest bus transportation company. The Greyhound Bus Museum is located in Hibbing. Included in the display of Greyhound busses is the famous Scenicruiser made by General Motors exclusively for Greyhound.

Hibbing Heights was platted in 1908 and annexed by Alice in 1910, when Alice incorporated as a city. Between 1919 and 1921, the Village of Hibbing was moved immediately south of Alice and then annexed Alice in 1920. Hibbing remained a village until 1979 when the Town of Stuntz was annexed. An Article of Incorporation was filed in July 1979 with the state and Hibbing became a city from that action in January 1980.

Hibbing is home to the world&#x27;s largest iron ore mine, which was discovered by Leonidas Merritt. Hibbing grew rapidly in its early years as the huge iron ore mines such as the Mahoning, Hull, Rust, Sellers, and Burt provided the raw material for America&#x27;s industrial revolution. In fact, the mines encroached on the village from the east, north, and west and it was determined that some of the ore body actually went under the town whose population had hit 20,000 by 1915.

Negotiations between the Oliver Mining Company and the village finally brought about a plan whereby the entire village would relocate to a site two miles south near Alice. The company, for its part, agreed to develop the downtown buildings with low interest loans that could be paid off over the years by the retailers. New civic structures such as Hibbing High School, the Androy Hotel, the Village Hall, and the Rood Hospital were also constructed with mining company money. In all, about 200 structures were moved down the First Avenue Highway, as it was called, to the new city. These included a store and even a couple of large hotels. Only one structure did not make it: the Sellers Hotel tumbled off some rollers and crashed to the ground leaving, as one witness said, &quot;an enormous pile of kindling&quot;. The move started in 1919 and the first phase was completed in 1921. Known today as &quot;North Hibbing&quot;, this area remained as a business and residential center through the 1940s when the mining companies bought the remaining structures. The last house was moved in 1968.

On July 25, 1979, Hibbing annexed the Town of Stuntz which comprised five townships. With this annexation, the following unincorporated communities were also annexed (community location by township, range and section indicated):

* Brooklyn (T57N, R20W, Section 6)
* Burton (T57N, R20W, Section 8)
* Darrow (T56N, R20W, Section 31)

<doc id="121759" wikidata="Q2230301" url="?curid=121759" title="Kinney, Minnesota">
<text>Kinney is a city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 152 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
Kinney gets its name from Hon. O. D. Kinney (Orrin Day Kinney; 1845–1911), who was one of the original European owners of the Merritt site in 1892 along with Judge J.T. Hale, and Capt. Joseph Sellwood. The land was originally occupied by Algonquian-speaking tribes, including the Ojibwe, Ottawa, and Potawatomi.

===Republic of Kinney===
Mary P. Anderson (1915–2007) was elected the first female mayor of Kinney (and on the Iron Range) from 1973 to 2002. By 1977, the City of Kinney, with a population of 325 according to the 1970 census, suffered from a failing water system, and was faced with a replacement cost of $186,000. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to secure funding from state and federal agencies due to bureaucratic red tape, agencies such as the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Commission (IRRRC), the city council was led to believe that it would be easier to receive foreign aid if Kinney seceded from the union, declared war, and lost immediately. Mayor Mary Anderson and a supportive Kinney City Council sent a secession letter to U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance on July 13, 1977.

The secession was never officially acknowledged by Vance or the U.S. The news story broke locally in the &quot;Mesabi Daily News&quot; on February 5, 1978, in an article by Ginny Wennen entitled &quot;Move over Monaco, here comes Kinney.&quot; The story garnered national and international attention beginning on February 7, 1978, when the story was featured on the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; with David Brinkley.

Jeno Paulucci, a businessman based in Duluth, Minnesota, was the first to acknowledge the new republic and offer &#x27;foreign aid&#x27; in the form of a dark brown 1974 Ford LTD police squad car and 10 cases of Jenos Sausage Pizza Mix on February 13, 1978. The squad car was painted with a Republic of Kinney shield on the driver&#x27;s side that read &quot;Commander in Chief, Republic of Kinney,&quot; and &quot;Chief of Police, Kinney, Mn.&quot; on the passenger side.

In November 1978, the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB) approved $198,000 grant, allocated in three payments of $66,000 per year from the Taconite Area Environmental Protection Fund, to repair the existing water system, construct cement runoff basins, and install additional fire hydrants.

The Republic of Kinney went on to create and sell over 1,600 passports between March and April 1978 at $1.00 apiece. Later the republic created buttons and sold T-shirts, and had a summer festival called &#x27;Secession Days&#x27;, which was first held during the weekend of August 1–2, 1987.

The city celebrated the 30th anniversary of its &quot;independence&quot; as the Republic of Kinney during the weekend of July 13–15, 2007. In conjunction with the 30th anniversary of the Kinney secession, the city published a book titled &quot;Republic of Kinney&quot;.

These groups include the Izaak Walton League of Duluth, Friends of the Cloquet Valley State Forest, the American Association of Foresters, Minnesota Chapter, Fish and Wildlife Alliance, Minnesotans for Responsible Recreation, the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society and many others. Feedback to the DNR was overwhelmingly in favor of &quot;closed unless posted open&quot;, but the DNR has chosen to take the most liberal interpretation of the law and push the &quot;open unless posted closed&quot; rule.

The DNR&#x27;s plan can be found here and contains reference on page

Additionally, a destination trail was opposed by some local residents and the Duluth-based organization Minnesotans for Responsible Recreation. The plan for the destination trail was revealed by the &quot;Duluth News Tribune&quot;, and some local residents were alarmed by the prospect of unfettered access in much of the forest coupled with intense advertising that would accompany the trail.

<text>Richmond is a city in Stearns County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,422 at the 2010 census. Richmond is part of the St. Cloud, Minnesota metropolitan area.

==History==
Richmond was platted in 1856 by Reuben Richardson, a farmer from Sauk Rapids who later served in Minnesota Legislature. The name &quot;Richmond&quot; may come from the surname of an early settler, the surname of Richardson&#x27;s wife, or an early surveyor. The original plat was a seven block by seven block square piece of land. Two years later, land owned by G.H. Brauning (also spelled Bruening), on the eastern side of the town, was added to Richmond&#x27;s plat. The town was incorporated in 1890, but went by the name Torah, because there was another town in southeastern Minnesota named Richmond. The same year of its incorporation, a Great Northern Railway station was built. The town&#x27;s post office and railroad station was named Torah until 1909, when the other Richmond&#x27;s post office closed. Following this, the name changed to Richmond, a name that locals identified with.

The pontoon boat was invented in Richmond in the 1950s by Ambrose Weeres, who was involved in the milling business, and Edwin Torborg, a farmer who manufactured feed mixers.

==Geography and transportation==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water.

When first platted, Richmond was within Munson Township. Richmond has since grown to become a separate municipality that has also annexed portions of Wakefield Township. Richmond serves as the northern terminus for State Highway 22, with the route ending when it connects with State Highway 23. Richmond is located about 15 miles west of Interstate 94 following State Highway 23. Glacial Lakes State Trail also runs through Richmond and connects it through different towns all the way to Willmar.

The town&#x27;s nickname, &quot;On the Horseshoe Chain of Lakes&quot;, is a nod to a geographical feature of the town. The town is home to a group of over a dozen lakes along the Sauk River, with the largest being Horseshoe Lake, hence the name &quot;Horseshoe Chain of Lakes&quot;.

Richmond is located in an area with many outcrops of granite. The area is known as &quot;Granite Country&quot;, as the material has been mined there for over 100 years and is home to around twenty different quarries.

A church on the site of today&#x27;s St. Agnes Church, still the dominant feature of the Roscoe skyline, was dedicated on October 18, 1898 to serve the area&#x27;s predominantly German-Catholic population. Roscoe formerly hosted a stop on the Great Northern Railway&quot;,&quot; but the tracks were abandoned in 1988 and subsequently razed.

<text>St. Joseph or Saint Joseph is a city in Stearns County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 7,029 at the 2020 census. It is home to the College of Saint Benedict.

St. Joseph is part of the St. Cloud Metropolitan Statistical Area. The unincorporated Florida community of St. Joseph, Florida, is named after the Minnesota city.

==History==
Originally home to the native Dakota people until the signing of the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851, St. Joseph was laid out in 1855.

Writing in 1997, Jewish-American historian of America&#x27;s religious architecture Marilyn J. Chiat described early settlement in the region, &quot;Father Francis X. Pierz, a missionary to [Native Americans] in central Minnesota, published a series of articles in 1851 in German Catholic newspapers advocating Catholic settlement in central Minnesota. Large numbers of immigrants, mainly German, but also Slovenian and Polish, responded. Over 20 parishes where formed in what is now Stearns County, each centered on a church-oriented hamlet. As the farmers prospered, the small frame churches were replaced by more substantial buildings of brick or stone... Stearns County retains in its German character and is still home to one of the largest rural Catholic populations in Anglo-America.&quot;

St. Joseph was named by early German and Slovenian settlers after the patron saint of their newly erected log chapel. 

Pioneer settlement in St. Joseph is very important to the history of the Slovenian diaspora. Fr. Pierz had previously brought with him from Slovenia his 12-year-old nephew Joseph Notsch Jr., the son of his sister, Mrs. Apollonia Notsch. Joseph Notsch would accompany him on his trips, assist by serving Mass, and when necessary do the cooking. In 1855, Notsch&#x27;s parents and siblings became the first Slovenian family to emigrate to the New World, and carried with them an altarpiece for Fr. Pierz which had been painted by Matevž Langus. The Notsch family, however, was accused of foolishness by Janez Bleiweis in the Ljubliana newspaper &quot;Novice&quot;. Apollonia Notsch, however, later wrote a famous letter from her family&#x27;s homestead in St. Joseph, describing the family&#x27;s passage on the immigrant ship, her impressions of frontier life in the Minnesota Territory, and expressed joy for having emigrated to America. The letter was published by Janez Bleiweis in the newspaper &quot;Novice&quot;, and convinced many other Slovene people to follow the Notsch family&#x27;s lead.

According to Fr. Bruno Riss (1829-1900), a Benedictine missionary priest from Augsburg, in the Kingdom of Bavaria and founding father of St John&#x27;s Abbey, the May 1856 arrival of the first Benedictine priests in the area at the invitation of Bishop Joseph Crétin was opposed by some local Catholic pioneers. This was because many local settlers had been tenant farmers in the German States and had emigrated to America seeking to own the farmland on which they worked. Recalling that religious orders in Germany had often been their landlords and fearing that the Benedictine order might turn them back into tenant farmers, the parishioners wrote to the Bishop, &quot;begging him not to impose monks on them&quot;. The Bishop, however, was outraged and placed St. Joseph under an interdict until after the parishioners apologized in August 1856. The Benedictines, however, successfully won the trust of local settlers by regularly helping them to both choose and defend their new homesteads.

After the lifting of the interdict against St. Joseph, the first Rocky Mountain locust plague to strike Central Minnesota began on the Feast of the Assumption of 15 August 1856, during the preaching of a mission by Father Francis Xavier Weninger inside the newly erected log chapel. The Rocky Mountain locusts darkened the sky and pounded upon the rooftop of the chapel so incredibly loud that they were mistaken for a thunder and hailstorm. Only after the mission did the real reason for the &quot;storm&quot; become apparent, and the clouds of &quot;hoppers&quot; swiftly devoured both the crops and much of the seed grain, which left the newly arrived German-American Catholic settlers of the region destitute.

St. Benedict&#x27;s Academy at Saint Joseph was a Native American residential school that was operated in St. Joseph by the College of Saint Benedict, opening in 1884. The school held Native American women and taught them traditional school subjects, like spelling, reading, and math, as well as sewing, ornamental needlework, baking, cooking, laundry, dairy-work, and gardening. 

St. Joseph was incorporated in 1890 and contains three properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the 1869 stone Church of St. Joseph, the 1918 First State Bank building, and a district of historic buildings at Saint Benedict&#x27;s Monastery and College built between 1882 and the 1920s.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Stearns County Road 75 serves as a main route in the community. Other routes include County Roads 2, 3, 121, 133, and 134. Interstate 94/US Highway 52 is nearby.
Some of the city&#x27;s major landmarks include St. Joseph Catholic Church, St. Benedict&#x27;s Monastery, and the College of St. Benedict. The College of Saint Benedict is an all-women&#x27;s Catholic college, and the complex is noted in the downtown area for the high spire of St. Joseph&#x27;s Church, and the rotunda and dome of the Monastery and College Sacred Heart Chapel. The architecture is different from other buildings and the major structures are visible from miles away.

St. Joseph is served by the St. Cloud Area School District, The majority of St. Joseph is zoned to Kennedy Community School (PK-8). while some portions in the east are zoned to Westwood Elementary School and North Middle School. The zoned high school is Apollo High School.

Kennedy Community School is a PreK-8 grade school, serving families from St. Joseph. The school opened in the Fall of 2008 following a successful referendum to build a larger school about a mile outside of town. The prior school, Kennedy Elementary, was established in 1968.

Saint Joseph Catholic School is a parochial school located in St. Joseph and has been associated with the local parish of the same name since the 1850s. At that time there was no money to pay a teacher, so parents did work for a local farmer, who in turn, taught the children. The school got its own building in the 1920s. For many years, it served as the only school in town and as the community center. The school later collaborated with the College of St. Benedict to become a lab school in the 1970s. In the 2000s, it joined with St. Cloud area parochial schools to become part of All Saints Academy.

===Higher education===
The College of Saint Benedict (CSB) is a four-year, private liberal arts college and the nation&#x27;s only Benedictine college for women. The college opened in 1913, with six students enrolled, and grew out of St. Benedict&#x27;s Academy, which was founded by Saint Benedict&#x27;s Monastery in 1889. The Benedictine community incorporated CSB in 1961. The college is also connected to Saint John&#x27;s University (SJU), which is a male-only university in Collegeville Township, Minnesota.
