<text>Homer is a town in and the parish seat of Claiborne Parish in northern Louisiana, United States. Named for the Greek poet Homer, the town was laid out around the Courthouse Square in 1850 by Frank Vaughn. The present-day brick courthouse, built in the Greek Revival style of architecture, is one of only four pre-Civil War courthouses in Louisiana still in use. The building, completed in 1860, was accepted by the Claiborne Parish Police Jury on July 20, 1861, at a cost of $12,304.36, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The other courthouses are in St. Francisville, St. Martinville and Thibodaux.

==History==
The city was once the home of Homer College (also known as Homer Colored College), a private school for African American students active from 1855 until early 1880s and offered bachelor&#x27;s degrees and masters degrees.

The Herbert S. Ford Memorial Museum operates across from the parish courthouse in the former Claiborne Hotel (completed 1890). The museum claims the oldest compressed bale of cotton in existence in the United States. This cotton display is believed to have been baled about 1930. Adjacent to the cotton exhibit is the &quot;Black Gold&quot;, a replica of an oilfield roughneck—a general laborer worker who loading and unloads cargo from crane baskets and keeps the drilling equipment clean—employed in the early 1930s by the Sinclair Oil and Gas Company. The exhibit has a recording which explains how a farm family, growing mostly cotton and corn faced great economic travail in Mississippi but relocated to Claiborne Parish to take advantage of the oil and natural gas boom. &quot;Oil changed our lives forever. We owe a lot to the men, mud, and mules that made it happen,&quot; concludes the recorded message. In 1921, oil was discovered in Homer; in 1921, another strike followed in Haynesville in northern Claiborne Parish. The boom continued through the 1930s and brought many customers to the then booming Hotel Claiborne, which had been established in 1890 and declared a state historic site in 1984.

Former Homer Mayor Alecia Smith was sentenced in 2017 after she pleaded guilty to two counts of malfeasance in office. She diverted Homer municipal funds to personal use and falsified public records. Her two five-year sentences were deferred, and she was instead placed on probation. She must pay a $1,000 fine and repay more than $6,000 to the municipality. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said that department will &quot;not stand for corrupt public officials. ... The people of our state deserve better and should expect more out of those who are appointed or elected to serve.&quot;

<text>Vidalia is the largest city and the parish seat of Concordia Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 4,299 as of the 2010 census.

Vidalia is located on the west bank of the Mississippi River.

The city of Natchez, Mississippi, lies on the opposite bank of the river, connected by the Natchez–Vidalia Bridge, carrying U.S. Routes 65, 84, and 425.

==History==
Vidalia was founded by Don José Vidal, when he was secretary to Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, the Spanish Governor of the Natchez District from 1792 to 1797. This was in a brief period of Spanish rule of former French territory west of the Mississippi River. Napoleon took it back and he sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.

In 1811 the Orleans Territorial legislature changed the name of the city to Vidalia after the founder. Vidal had donated land along the river to the city, where it later constructed its civic buildings. He also donated land for the first school in Concordia Parish.

The Great Sandbar Duel, featuring Jim Bowie, was a formal one-on-one duel that erupted into a violent brawl involving multiple combatants on September 19, 1827. It is a regional legend still told by local residents.

Vidalia is home to Louisiana&#x27;s first hydroelectric power plant and the largest prefabricated power plant in the world. A total of 41 countries and 21 states collaborated in this historic endeavor, the Sidney A. Murray, Jr. Hydroelectric Station, located in the southern portion of Concordia Parish. The power plant began operation in 1990. The office is located on Texas Street in town.

Hyram Copeland, a Democrat, was repeatedly re-elected; he served as mayor of Vidalia from 1992 to 2016. He is a 2013 inductee of the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame.

<text>Grand Cane is a village in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 242 at the 2010 census, up from 191 in 2000. It is part of the Shreveport–Bossier City Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is the hometown of women&#x27;s basketball pioneer Linda Gamble.

==History==

Prior to the incorporation of the village of Grand Cane in 1899, the settlement of four families (Thomas Abington, Israel Rogers, Wright Hobgood, and John Wagner) influenced the development of the area around two wagon trails that intersected in the sparsely populated area known as the Grand Cane Territory. In 1881, Amanda Hobgood (widow of Wright Hobgood) deeded land to the New Orleans &amp; Pacific Railway and had the village of Grand Cane laid out in lots and streets. By 1899, the village was incorporated, and the first mayor was E.R. Fortson. The first village councilmen were Paul E. Allen, Loderick Monroe Cook, and Dr. J.B. Johns. The population soon grew to almost 500.

As the village developed, spurred by the railway and the two crossroads (LA Hwys. 171 and 3015),a business community developed which included seven stores, a dentist, bank, post office, blacksmith shop, livery stable, two hotels, four doctors (Drs. Broadway, Leopold, Bannaman, &amp; Curtis), three drug stores (Edwards, Leopold, &amp; Allen), telephone office, newspaper, restaurant, two cotton gins, and various distinguished residential homes. The community was enhanced by the first accredited public high school in Louisiana, and a Presbyterian, Methodist, and two Baptist churches.

The village continued to thrive until the Great Depression of 1929. The downward spiral continued with the demise of the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway in the late 1950s. The steady decline of agricultural industry, the lack of new businesses, the loss of the public school, and a general movement away from the rural area saw the end of the village as a center for trade. Grand Cane, like so many small towns left behind by progress, simply went to sleep until 1993, when the village used funds from a rural development grant from the state of Louisiana to purchase the Hicks &amp; Richardson building.

This action spurred the passage of a preservation ordinance, creating the Grand Cane Preservation Commission, which resulted in the subsequent listing on the National Register of Historic Places of several buildings in the Historic District (Platt, Old Post Office, Cook &amp; Douglas, Hicks &amp; Richardson, &amp; Ricks Bros.). These buildings joined the Village Hall and the Grand Cane Methodist Church that had obtained earlier listings.

===Present day===
The Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995, including the Village Hall (Bank of Grand Cane) which gained National Register status earlier in 1988. The Historic District status recognizes the fact that the exterior of the buildings in this short block and a half have remained much the same as when they were built around the turn of the century. Grand Cane is the home of the historic Cook-Hill House Bed and Breakfast. Buildings listed on the National Register include the following. The W.W. Platt Dental Office was built in 1939. The George N. Parker Company building (1910) was a general merchandise store advertised as &quot;The Shoe and Hat Specialist&quot;. The Cook &amp; Douglas Building (1903, owners L.M. Cook &amp; Charles A. Douglas), advertised as a general merchandise and plantation supply store, with &quot;Highest prices paid for Cotton &amp; Cotton Seed&quot;; the adjoining side building served as a storage for the Cook &amp; Douglas Building. The Bank of Grand Cane Building (circa 1902), served as a bank until 1970, when the building was donated to the village. It now is the Grand Cane village hall and is affectionately referred to as &quot;the Village&quot;. The first Grand Cane Bank was headed by W.H. Smith. The bank has a very colorful history, and was robbed several times. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 11, 1988. The Hicks &amp; Richardson Building, circa 1902, housed an established &quot;General Merchandise and Plantation supplies&quot; store. It featured staples and fancy groceries along with buggies and wagons. The Ricks Brothers Building, circa 1915, later became Gamble Brothers. General merchandise and groceries were sold and delivered to homes. Today, these buildings house shops, restaurants, the village hall, a community theater and a &quot;mall&quot; of diverse businesses. 
In September 2009 the Village of Grand Cane Cultural District was certified by the Louisiana Cultural Districts, Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. This initiative has added to the community revitalization with added cultural activity by the DeSoto Arts Council and the establishment of the DeSoto Arts Council Gallery, where original art can be purchased tax free. The DAC Gallery is located in the Hicks-Richardson Building. Also located in the Hicks Richardson Building is the Back Alley Theater and the Raven Book Store.

<text>Logansport is a town in western DeSoto Parish adjacent to the Sabine River in western Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,340 in 2020. It is part of the Shreveport–Bossier City metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The area, long a disputed boundary even after the Louisiana Purchase, was part of a neutral territory negotiated by Gen. James Wilkinson and Lt. Col. Simón de Herrera on November 6, 1806.

The Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, that was not ratified until 1821, would have been a solution but in 1821 Mexico&#x27;s independence reignited the dispute. Dr. Logan moved to the area in 1830 began practicing medicine in Louisiana and Texas. He chartered a ferry business in the area and it became known as Logan&#x27;s Ferry.

Texas won independence in 1836, and the newly formed Republic of Texas agreed to the Adams–Onís Treaty, so the Sabine River became the international boundary. The survey crew began the demarcation process on May 20, 1840, at the Gulf of Mexico, and work was completed in 1841. Boundary markers were placed along the boundary, that included one in Logansport. This marker apparently is the only one surviving, meaning it is the only known international boundary marker in the United States. The Texas Annexation of 1845, ended nine years of the Sabine River international boundary.

The name Logansport was given to the town when a post office was established February 28, 1848. There were few people living in the town prior to the arrival of the railroad. With the arrival of the railroad, there was an influx of gamblers and others of questionable character, along with the citizens of better repute. At one time Logansport had more saloons than grocery stores. The town began to grow and it was incorporated. The first election was held on June 25, 1887. In this election there were only 15 qualified voters listed. Elijah Price was elected mayor, along with five other trustees. Oil and gas were also a very important source of income for the early citizens of Logansport.

==Geography==
Logansport is located at (31.974785, −93.997471). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (4.45%) is water.

<doc id="115552" wikidata="Q2695723" url="?curid=115552" title="Stonewall, Louisiana">
<text>Stonewall is a town in northern DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,814 at the 2010 census, increasing to 2,273 in 2020. It is part of the Shreveport–Bossier City metropolitan statistical area.

North DeSoto High School and the Garland Scout Ranch of the Boy Scouts of America are located in Stonewall.

== History ==

The first settlers came to the Stonewall area in the early 1830s. Colonel Edwards moved his family and possessions from Society Hill, South Carolina to a place they named the Bee Gum Community. This is approximately three miles east of the present Town of Stonewall.
Sometime later, friends of Colonel Edwards moved to the North DeSoto Area. Among these were the Witherspoons, Marshalls, Hollembeaks and others. The women came in carriages, the men on horses while their belongings were brought in wagons drawn by oxen and mules. The slaves followed with the livestock.
After building homes and beginning a farmer&#x27;s life, more provisions were needed. They were ordered from New Orleans and reached Shreve&#x27;s Port on the Red River. It took time to get to Shreve&#x27;s Port in those days. They went by wagons over the rough, muddy roads or paths, reaching Shreve&#x27;s Port after a whole day&#x27;s travel. These trips were not made often.
Soon many families from other communities and states came to make their homes here. Some of the families that have done much toward the building of this community are: Williamson, Powell, Andrews, Loftus, Nicholson, Berry, Gilmer, Lafitte, Hall, and many others.
Black Jack, the first Post Office of the Bee Gum Community, as it was then called, was used in the 1860s. It was located near Welcome Hall, the home of Colonel Edwards. Mail came very irregularly. Later the Star Route Mail came into existence and ran once or twice a week. The route ran from Shreve&#x27;s Port to Spring Ridge, Stonewall, Kingston, and on to Mansfield.
In 1862, the community moved its center about three miles west to the site of the new Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad. The community was given its present name when the railroad stop was named after the legendary Civil War General, Stonewall Jackson.
Cotton was king in those days and several sizable plantations ringed the Stonewall area. Some of these were Buena Vista, Allendale, Lands End, and Welcome Hall.
A supplemental industry to cotton had its meager beginning in 1886 when Mrs. J.J. Marshall bought a registered Jersey cow. From this beginning grew a thriving dairy business which blossomed in the early 1900s. By 1943 there were 37 individual dairies in the community of Stonewall.
Stonewall remained a dairy and farming community until the 1960s when people began to realize its proximity to Shreveport, its friendly industries people and its progressive educational system. The town would soon become a bedroom community to Shreveport.
Stonewall is located on a modern four lane highway, Highway 171 in North DeSoto Parish, and only six miles from Shreveport. Interstate 49 is located approximately a mile and a half east of the Stonewall city limits. Highway 171 was first graveled in 1916 and ran from Shreveport to Mansfield. It was built partially by convict labor. The road was paved in the 1930s.
During 1971, a group of Stonewall citizens met and petitioned the Governor to incorporate Stonewall as a village. The town was incorporated July 12, 1972. Mr. Bob Midyett was appointed by the Governor to be the first Mayor of Stonewall. Aldermen were: Bobby Dyson, Gerald Holmes, and Charles Scott. Tax Collector A. L. Bice, Street Commissioner was Curtis McCune Jr., City Marshall was Elmo Smith, Attorney was Charles Scott and Town Clerk was Dudley Glenn. Stonewall was declared a Town by the Governor of Louisiana July 1983.
The first official election was in the spring of 1974. Curtis L. McCune Jr., was elected Mayor and all other elected officials remained the same.
The Town Meetings were first held at the First National Bank building in Stonewall. Later they were moved to the school cafeteria to have more room. In December 1974, the Cox &amp; Hall building was purchased and remodeled for the Town Hall. This was later sold to the DeSoto Parish Library and is presently being used for that purpose. The present Town Hall, located approximately one-fourth mile north of the first Town Hall, was purchased in July 1983. It has served at various times as the Fire Department Office, Voting Polls, Town Hall, and General Meeting Place for the citizens of Stonewall. Part of the Town Hall is being used by the DeSoto Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Office as a Substation. This Substation is the first of its kind in DeSoto Parish. The Sheriff&#x27;s Substation opened Tuesday, March 14, 1995.
Stonewall grew from 532 population in 1972 to over 1,000 in 1983. As of May 1995, the population was 1,500. 1998&#x27;s population was 1626 and as of the 2010 census the population was 1,814.

<text>Zachary is a city in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, United States. It lies north of the city of Baton Rouge, and had a population of 14,960 at the 2010 census, up from 11,275 in 2000. At the 2020 census, Zachary&#x27;s population increased to 19,316.

==History==
Much of the land which the city now occupies was part of a farm owned by Darel Zachary (1827-1907). In the 1880s, Zachary sold his land to the Illinois Central Railroad, who built a track and a depot on it. A village quickly grew up around the depot, which came to be called &quot;Zachary&quot; after the original farmer. Zachary&#x27;s first post office was opened in 1885, and it was incorporated as a city on August 2, 1889, with Thomas Edward McHugh as its first mayor. A fire devastated the city in 1903, supposedly caused by a greengrocer trying to flame-ripen his bananas. The &quot;historic village&quot; at the center of the city is composed of buildings which either survived the fire, or were built shortly after it, the oldest (excluding the depot) being the 1898 Allison House. The first census was carried out in 1914 and reported just 419 residents. In 1966 Zachary became the first city in Louisiana since the Reconstruction Era to elect a Republican as mayor, Jack Louis Breaux.

==Geography==
Zachary is located in northern East Baton Rouge Parish. It is bordered to the north by the city of Slaughter, to the east by Central, and to the south by Baker.

<doc id="115565" wikidata="Q2044239" url="?curid=115565" title="Lake Providence, Louisiana">
<text>Lake Providence is a town in, and the parish seat of, East Carroll Parish in northeastern Louisiana. The population was 5,104 at the 2000 census and declined by 21.8 percent to 3,991 in 2010. The town&#x27;s poverty rate is approximately 55 percent; the average median household income is $16,500, and the average age is 31.

The town shares its name with the oxbow lake of the Mississippi River, also called Lake Providence. This area was historically developed as cotton plantations before and after the Civil War, and remains largely rural. The Union Army developed a supply depot near the lake during the Civil War, and its camp was crowded with refugee slaves seeking their freedom. The town grew larger at this site.

==History==
In the late 18th century goods such as animal pelts, indigo, and cotton were transported on the Mississippi River by people commonly known as longboat men, named for the type of craft that carried the goods. These were eventually replaced by steamboats. Thieves and pirates raided the longboats, killing the crew and selling the goods. Bunch&#x27;s Bend is named for a pirate who would raid the boats at this place, where they had to maneuver the bend in the river. If the longboat men made it past Bunch&#x27;s Bend without being robbed, they would say they, &quot;made it to Providence.&quot;

The trading town of Providence developed at the bend. It later was renamed as Lake Providence when the town was moved to its current location surrounding a natural oxbow lake. The Lake Providence area first opened for European-American settlement in the late 1830s, after the federal government enforced Indian Removal to Indian Territory further west of the Mississippi River, and extinguished their land titles. Settlers drained the cypress swamps along the Mississippi River and used enslaved African Americans to clear the land for cultivation.

===Civil War===
By the start of the American Civil War in 1861, the region consisted mostly of large cotton plantations along the river, which were worked by thousands of slave laborers.

The town of Lake Providence developed after the arrival of the Union Army in the spring of 1862. Under the direction of General Ulysses S. Grant, the area by Lake Providence was established as a supply depot and base of operations for the Vicksburg Campaign. The soldiers dug a canal between the Mississippi River and Lake Providence. The area was called &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Rest&quot;. Grant subsequently moved his troops south for temporary residence at Winter Quarters south of Newellton in Tensas Parish. As slaves crowded into the camp at Lake Providence to gain freedom from surrounding plantations, the population quickly soared from a few hundred to several thousand. What began as a simple military supply camp quickly transformed into a city with a large population of African-American refugees.

By the time Vicksburg, Mississippi fell to the Union in 1863, most planters in the Lake Providence area had fled, and their plantations lay empty. The Union Army determined that they should be productive again.

===20th century===
After white Democrats regained power in the state legislature after the Reconstruction Era, they worked to reimpose white supremacy. Many blacks worked as sharecroppers or tenant farmers in the region. In 1898, Louisiana, like other southern states, enacted a new constitution, designed to maintain Democratic Party dominance and forestall any alliances such as the Populist-Republican alliance that had won seats in the 1890s. They included provisions that raised barriers to voter registration and elections, effectively disfranchising most blacks despite their constitutional 15th Amendment right to vote. Their exclusion from the political system made them second-class citizens.

The civil rights movement of the post-World War II period from the 1940s through the 1960s brought efforts of a new generation to make constitutional rights more equitable. Until 1962, no African Americans had been allowed to register to vote in Lake Providence or East Carroll Parish in forty years when U.S. District Judge Edwin Ford Hunter, Jr., based in Lake Charles in the far southwestern corner of the state, personally registered twenty-eight African Americans in Lake Providence under a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which had been signed into law by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Hunter was challenged by Louisiana 6th Judicial District Judge Frank Voelker Sr., who was based in Lake Providence, in a dispute over the powers of the national government. The case attracted national attention, as the civil rights movement highlighted the constitutional infringement of the rights of African Americans in the South.

Following national Democratic support for the passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, most African Americans allied with that party. With a majority African-American electorate, Lake Providence voters in the 21st century continue to support Democratic Party candidates. Conservative whites tended to leave the Democratic Party after the 1960s, and have overwhelmingly joined the Republican Party. In the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, East Carroll Parish voted handily for Democrat Barack H. Obama of Illinois, rather than his Republican opponents, John McCain of Arizona and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.55%) is water.
The existing boundaries of the town constitute the third location of the community. Lake Providence is located adjacent to the Mississippi River. Prior to the building of the current levee system by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the meandering river would overflow its bank and take valuable lands. It was such flooding that the lake of Lake Providence was created and the town was washed away by the river. Each time the town was taken by the river, the citizens moved.

Historian John D. Winters describes Lake Providence as &quot;a beautiful oxbow lake some six miles (10 km) long, an old Mississippi river bed with an outlet through Baxter Bayou into Bayou Macon and thus into the Tensas, Ouachita, Black, and Red rivers.

===Climate===
==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 3,587 people, 1,221 households, and 695 families residing in the town.

==Education==
Public schools operated by the East Carroll Parish School Board include Southside Elementary School (PK-5), Lake Providence Junior High School (grades 6–8), and Lake Providence Senior High School (9-12). The private school Briarfield Academy is grades PK to 12.

==Representation in other media==
Several episodes of the 1959 NBC television series &quot;Riverboat&quot;, starring Darren McGavin, deal with pirates on the Mississippi River or the shipment of cotton. It is set in the middle 19th century, rather than the 18th.

<text>Chataignier is a village in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 364 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The name &quot;Chataignier&quot; is French and means &quot;chinquapin,&quot; a small chestnut. Chinquapins (&quot;Castanea pumila&quot;) grew abundantly in the surrounding prairie until the chestnut blight wiped them out. They are now non-existent in the Chataignier community.

Gleanings from old records indicate that Chataignier&#x27;s first settler was Ursiana Manuel, who came from Mexico via New Orleans circa 1793 when Louisiana was a Spanish colony and George Washington was serving as President of the new republic known as the United States of America. Manuel&#x27;s descendants are still living on the original land grant obtained during the Spanish domination of Louisiana. Other early settlers mentioned include Jacques Fontenot, Louis Redan, General Garis de Flaugeac, Artemon Lafleur, and Valentine Savoy. Savoy, incidentally, was the first man to begin the manufacture of spinning wheels in this part of the country; he operated a large plantation, a cotton gin and a saw mill.

The settlers of Chataignier have long enjoyed the benefits of religion (predominantly Catholic), education and postal service, in that order. The second oldest church in the Evangeline country was founded in Chataignier. Records show that it was first a mission of St. Landry Catholic Church in Opelousas beginning in 1856 but that in 1869 it was created as a separate parish called Our Lady of Mount Carmel. A church was built with Father Jean Baptiste Bre as its first pastor. In 1901, the then pastor Father A. L. Bacchioci moved to the new nearby village of Eunice, of which Chataignier became a mission at that time. The following year, Chataignier became an established church and separate parish for the second time and has remained so to this day.

The Chataignier community&#x27;s educational background dates back to the pre-Civil War year of 1858 when the first known school, the Onezine Lafleur School, was located in the upper Chataignier community. Although the name of the teacher prior to the Civil War is unknown, it has been established that Dorsin Lafleur was appointed teacher for a short period of time during the war. The war itself eventually brought about the close of the school; however, in 1879, Mrs. P.H. Marueney was appointed to teach and the school reopened. At this time, French was the language used and taught in school. Progress continued and by 1887 Chataignier had one of the eight public schools in the parish.

The Chataignier post office was established on November 20, 1879, in what was known at that time as St. Landry Parish. In 1910, the very large area of St. Landry Parish was divided up to form several other parishes, one of which was Evangeline. Chataignier now occupies the southeastern part of that parish. The Village of Chataignier was incorporated in January 1973 with a population of 375. Old historical spots have long disappeared and all that remains are parish lines, township lines, and section lines (all used in land surveys). The economy of the area is agriculturally based.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 259 people, 142 households, and 71 families residing in the village.

==Education==
Public schools in Evangeline Parish are operated by the Evangeline Parish School Board. Chataignier Elementary School is located in the village of Chataignier and serves students in grades pre-kindergarten through eight.

==Notable people==

*Sady Courville (1905–1988), Cajun fiddler

<text>Mamou is a town in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 3,242 at the 2010 census, down from 3,566 in 2000.

==Geography==
Mamou is located in south-central Evangeline Parish at (30.634033, −92.418913). Louisiana Highway 13 follows the western border of the town, leading north to Reddell and south to Eunice. Ville Platte, the parish seat, is to the northeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Mamou has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Many stories exist regarding the origin of the name &quot;Mamou&quot;. One may have been the legendary Indian, Chief Mamou. It is certain that this vast prairie was known as &quot;Mamou Prairie&quot; as far back as the 18th century and that Anglo-Americans first called it &quot;Mammouth Prairie&quot; because of its immense size. When the French came, they called it &quot;Mamou&quot; for mammoth. &quot;Mamou&quot; is also a family name found in France.

Within this vast stretch of prairie, the town site of Mamou was platted in 1907 by Curley C. Duson of Eunice. He was president of the Mamou Town Site Company which opened an office on the corner of Seventh and Chestnut. Lot auctions were held weekly and lots were sold for $50. The original village covered one square mile. On January 11, 1911, Mamou was incorporated.

Cotton was the major crop for many years on the prairie. By 1915, the village boasted four cotton gins producing thousands of bales of cotton; however, the decline in the demand for cotton led local farmers toward the growing of rice that is now the major crop of the area.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,936 people, 1,128 households, and 615 families residing in the town.

==Education==
Public schools in Evangeline Parish are operated by the Evangeline Parish School Board. Three campuses serve the town of Mamou – Mamou Elementary School (Grades PK–4), Mamou Upper Elementary (Grades 5–8), and Mamou High School (Grades 9–12). Mamou Upper Elementary and Mamou High School are located on the same campus.

==Culture==
Mamou is located at the heart of Louisiana&#x27;s Cajun country. The town is famous for its music and musicians, and bills itself as &quot;The Cajun Music Capital of the World&quot;. Consequently, Mamou figures into a number of song titles (such as &quot;&#x27;Tit Galop Pour Mamou,&quot; &quot;Valse de Grand Mamou,&quot; &quot;Mamou Two-Step,&quot; and &quot;Mamou Hot Step&quot;) and lyrics such as &quot;Somewhere Over China&quot; by Jimmy Buffett, as well as band names (such as Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys). Mamou is also home of the world-famous Fred&#x27;s Lounge, which features live Cajun music every Saturday morning. Each year the town holds a Courir de Mardi Gras.

<text>Colfax is a town in, and the parish seat of, Grant Parish, Louisiana, United States, founded in 1869. Colfax is part of the Alexandria, Louisiana metropolitan area. The largely African American population of Colfax counted 1,558 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Colfax is most known for a Reconstruction Era massacre known as the Colfax massacre which took place Easter, April 13, 1873, to quell black voting. One hundred-fifty African Americans and three whites were killed in one of the most egregious acts of terrorism during Reconstruction. A white militia was led against freedmen by Christopher Columbus Nash, who claimed to have been elected sheriff on a Fusionist/Democratic slate. Freedmen were defending Republican officials at the county courthouse and had gathered there as tensions rose in a post-election dispute. A contemporary report by the U.S. military documented the three white fatalities and 105 black victims by name, with 15-20 unidentified blacks found in the Red River. The disproportionate number of deaths between whites and blacks, and documented accounts that at least 50 black prisoners were executed while unarmed and under control of the white militia, 20th-century historians redefined the &quot;riot&quot; as a &quot;massacre&quot;. The event is significant because blacks, who comprised the majority in the parish, organized to defend themselves and their political rights and were mass murdered.

The riot arose from the disputed gubernatorial election of 1872, finally determined in the favor of the Republican William Pitt Kellogg by the federal government. Both the Fusion-Democrats and the Republicans held inaugurations and certified their own slates of local officers. Following the events of 1873, in 1874 Nash gathered many of the same men to establish the White League, a white supremacist paramilitary organization that operated on behalf of Democrats and eventually had chapters in many areas of Louisiana. It worked to intimidate and attack black voters, to run Republicans out of office, and to suppress black voting.

On April 13, 1921, the white citizens of Colfax unveiled a marble obelisk that read, &quot;In Loving Remembrance, Erected to the Memory of the Heroes, Stephen Decatur Parish, James West Hadnot, Sidney Harris. Who fell in the Colfax Riot, fighting for White Supremacy, April 13, 1873.&quot;

In 1950 the state commerce department erected a historical marker identifying the site of the &quot;Colfax Riot&quot;; it says that the militia&#x27;s victory &quot;marked the end of carpetbag misrule in the South.&quot; Because of similar insurgent paramilitary violence in other areas of the state, especially during campaigns and elections, federal troops remained in Louisiana until 1877, when they were removed on orders of U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.

In 2007, the Red River Heritage Association was founded to collect and interpret the history of Reconstruction, especially in the Red River area and Louisiana. The association is raising funds to restore a bank in Colfax near the former courthouse site to use as a museum, archives and interpretive center.

<text>Jeanerette () is a city in Iberia Parish, Louisiana, United States. Known as &quot;Sugar City&quot;, it had a population of 5,530 at the 2010 census, a decrease of 467 from the 2000 tabulation of 5,997. It is two thirds African American, many of them Creoles of color. Jeanerette is the part of the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area; its parish is also one of the 22 included in the Acadiana region, which has had a high proportion of Francophones.

==History==

===Early years===
In the 18th century, French colonist Pierre Zerangue acquired the land where Jeanerette developed from the Spanish government. Zerangue received an &quot;order of survey and settlement&quot; from Spain for . Under Spanish law, if a person occupied a piece of property for two years, they could apply for title to the land under an &quot;order of survey settlement.&quot; 

Colonist Nicholas Provost acquired property extending from the present-day experimental farm to the St. Mary Parish line. He engaged in sugar cultivation, based on the labor of enslaved Americans and African Americans, until his death in 1816.

The town derived its name from John W. Jeanerette, a native of South Carolina who had moved to the developing area in the 1820s. First he worked as a tutor for a planter&#x27;s family, as did numerous educated young adults from northern states in the antebellum period. He opened a store and saloon. Having saved some money, Jeanerette purchased Pine Grove Plantation &quot;circa&quot; 1830, which was formerly known as &quot;Beau Pré&quot; (meaning lovely meadow/pasture).

Jeanerette offered a portion of his house to be used as a mail depository for local residents. Later Jeanerette was appointed as the town&#x27;s first postmaster (he dropped his middle initial in official records.) The name Jeanerette was later adopted for the post office and town.

In 1871, Lazard Wormser, an early Jewish settler to the area emigrating from Alsace, France. He opened a small general store in downtown Jeanerette. He was soon joined by other members of the Wormser family, who later established branches of Wormser&#x27;s Department Store in downtown New Iberia and Franklin.

During the 19th century, to the north along the Bayou Teche a settlement was developed by free Créoles of color; it is now known as Grand Marais. These free people of color were descended from African and European ancestors. They had largely adopted French culture, Catholicism and language, and were often still French speakers into the 20th century.

===Incorporation===

Jeanerette was incorporated as a town in 1878 and Joseph E. Provost became the first mayor; its economy was based on the cypress lumber and sugar industries. Its nickname has been &quot;Sugar City&quot;. Although its major growth was after the Civil War, it has some surviving antebellum houses in the city and region.

Sugarcane continues as a key factor in the economy. There were until the 21st century three active sugar mills. The one located in the city was closed, dismantled, and its equipment sold in the first decade of the 21st century. Jeanerette is the home of manufacturers of equipment for the cultivation, harvesting and processing of sugarcane. Today, additional sources of income include oil and natural gas, salt, carbon black, a garment distribution center, and fishing.

During this period, 63% of all housing units were single-unit structures, 23% were mobile homes, and 14% were multi-unit structures. 13% of the housing units had been built since 1990.

The estimated median annual income for a household in the village during 2012-2016 was $42,625, and for a family was $47,500. Male full-time workers had a median income of $61,094 versus $28,500 for females. The per capita income for the village was $20,733. 27.0% of the population and 18.7% of families were below the poverty line, along with 39.4% of people under the age of 18 and 9.5% of people age 65 and over.

==Culture==
Sugarcane farming remains is an important activity in the immediate area surrounding the village. Sugarcane harvest time occurs from September to December annually. Many farmers deliver their harvest to local sugar cooperatives with tractor-drawn cane carts. The Louisiana Sugarcane Festival occurs annually in September in the nearby town of New Iberia.

Many of the villages current and former inhabitants are of Cajun heritage, and French is spoken by many families as a second language.

Boat building, in many shapes and forms, is an important cultural activity that has impacted the village of Loreauville. From large shipyards such as Breaux&#x27;s Bay Craft, Neuville Boat Works, and Breaux Brothers that build aluminum oceangoing work vessels to the traditional wood Cajun pirogue hand-crafted by local residents, boat building and the use of the local waterways such as Bayou Teche and Lake Dauterive have been an important activity for residents since the establishment of the village.

Loreauville has several parades each year, including Mardi Gras, Homecoming Parade, and Christmas Parade.
For many years, one of the first museums (&quot;The Heritage Village&quot;) in southern Louisiana dedicated to the history of the Acadians and the Cajun culture was on Main Street near the present day Loreauville High School. The &quot;Heritage Village&quot; was privately owned and funded by a local resident well versed in the history and culture of the Acadians. The museum site was located behind a private home west of School Drive and north of the existing Loreauville High School Gymnasium. The museum area was an outdoor facility in a large horseshoe shape, with the apex of the horseshoe near Bayou Teche. The museum was in operation from approximately 1970 until the early 1980s. Several period buildings were donated to the museum from local residents and moved to the site, including the original one-room schoolhouse that was used in Loreauville between 1900 and 1925. Other displays in the museum celebrated local Cajun culture with displays of period clothing, housewares, and early historic relics from the 19th century. A small collection of the artifacts from the Loreauville museum were donated to the Acadian Village in Lafayette upon the closure of the Loreauville Museum. In the late 70s, the original Pulpit from the Catholic Church was found in the collection and was donated back to the Church and renovated and reinstalled by Father Ronald Groschen.

==Points of interest==

Bayou Teche winds its way through Loreauville along the western edge of the Village. Several 19th century wood-fired sugar mills were located along Bayou Teche within the village limits. The growing of sugar cane was an important crop in the early days of the settlement. One processing site was located approximately north of the Loreauville Bridge on Bridge Street, on the east bank of the bayou. As late as 1970 several brick foundations and remains of the original fire pits and kettles were visible on the banks of the bayou. Alterations to the landscape in that area have rendered this and most other sites invisible to the naked eye, but archeological evidence (fired bricks, and other detritus) remains just beneath the surface. With the centralization of sugarcane processing via agricultural cooperatives, local processing became more centralized at the Vida Shaw sugar mill, which operated from the late 1930s until the early 1970s on Bayou Teche at Vida Shaw Road.

Lake Dauterive or Lake Fausse Pointe is located to the east of Loreauville and is a popular spot for hunting, fishing, and recreational water sports. The boat landing at the end of Louisiana Highway 3242 (Lake Dauterive Road) was one of several filming locations for the 1977 film &quot;Return to Boggy Creek&quot;. Lake Fausse Pointe State Park is east of the boat landing and is accessible via Parish Road 169/Bayou Benoit Levee Road via travel through St. Martin Parish.

The Loreauville branch of the Iberia Parish Public Library, now located on Broussard Road next to Loreauville Elementary School, replaced the old 1960&#x27;s era Public Library located at Main Street and Breaux Street.

Loreauville High School, one of five public high schools in Iberia Parish, serves local students from 7th through 12th grade. This masonry and wood facility was constructed in the early 1940s. The main building has been renovated, expanded, and modernized over the years to accommodate a growing student population. The main building in the 1940s housed all of Loreauville&#x27;s student population, and as the village grew in population, additional facilities were added. The original central building may be the oldest school facility in continuous use in Iberia Parish.

==Historic businesses, buildings and structures==
Main Street in Loreauville has evolved over the years since the establishment of the village. The descriptions of notable businesses and structures that follow begin at the north end of the village, on North Main Street, and terminate at the south end, on South Main Street:

*(Nick) Borel&#x27;s Grocery, situated on Main and Braquet Street at the north end of the village. Borel&#x27;s grocery was in operation from the late 1940s until the mid-1970s when it was sold. Several businesses have subsequently occupied the building.
*Homer&#x27;s Texaco Service Station, located at the northeast corner of the intersection of Louisiana Highway 86 and Lake Dauterive Road (Louisiana Highway 3242). The family-owned business was in continuous operation from 1946 until the late 1990s. The existing large metal frame of the building was constructed by Roy Breaux Sr. and the welders of Breaux&#x27;s Bay Craft in 1961.
*W.W. Vaughn General Merchandise (General Store), located at the southeast corner of the intersection of Louisiana Highway 86 and Lake Dauterive Road (Louisiana Highway 3242). The family-owned business was located in a 19th-century brick and wood-frame structure that operated from the early 1900s until the early 1970s. The store originally opened as the &quot;Edgar J. Vaughn General Merchandise&quot; store prior to World War I. As was common in those days, the Edgar Vaughn store issued its own tin coinage as local currency in various denominations (mainly 1-, 5-, and 10-cent denominations) when dealing in barter transactions as a way to equalize transactions. Few of the coins exist today, but a few were donated to the Acadian Village museum by family members. The building was eradicated in the early 21st century, replaced by a Family Dollar retail store.
*The OJ Oubre Lumber Company, named for Oscar J. Oubre, operated from the present location of the Judice Building Supplies (JBS) store. The Loreauville branch of the OJ Oubre lumber company was a separate store owned and operated by the OJ Oubre lumber company of New Iberia.
*&quot;Tiger Inn&quot; a small fast food restaurant named after the local High School Football team mascot (The Loreauville Tigers). Tiger Inn has been in continuous operation since the early 1970&#x27;s and serves as a local landmark on Main Street. The restaurant serves traditional fast food fare with menu offerings that reflect the local Cajun culture.
*The State National Bank Building, located at the intersection of Main Street and Ed Broussard Road, is a masonry facility that was constructed in the early 1960s and served as the only financial institution in Loreauville for many years. Ownership and identity of the facility has changed many times over the years, but many residents still refer to the facility as the &quot;State National Bank Building&quot;. A large clock was a prominent feature of the original bank and served the local residents and teenagers in the 1960s and &#x27;70s.
*Aunt Tee&#x27;s Restaurant, located on the west side of Main Street at Ed Broussard Road, was a family business that operated from the late 1950s until the early 1970s serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The &quot;Plate Lunch&quot; (from the French &quot;Plat du Jour&quot;) was a popular menu item for many of the hard workers of the area.
*Gonsoulin Insurance Agency, located on Main Street between Ed Broussard Road and Gonsoulin Street. This 1970s-style building was the home of the family-owned Gonsoulin Insurance Agency which operated from the late 1960s until the mid-1980s.
*The Western Auto Store, located on Main Street directly across from the original U.S. post office. This building operated as a Western Auto Parts affiliate from the late 1960s until the early 1980s. A Dollar General now occupies the building.
*Harold&#x27;s Barber Shop, located on Main Street across from the old U.S. post office. Harold Melancon operated a small barbershop at this location from the late 1960s until the late 1970s.
*U.S. Postal Mail facility (pictured). Located on Main Street, this small building served as the official post office for ZIP code 70552 until the mid 1960&#x27;s, when it was replaced by a larger brick facility at the same location. A modern larger facility constructed in the 1990&#x27;s replaced the 1960&#x27;s era building on the northern edge of the village. The mid 1960&#x27;s brick post office structure remains and has been the site of several businesses in the intervening years.
*Loreauville Substation of the Iberia Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Department, located on Main Street adjacent to the Meat Market. This small wood-framed structure served as a police substation and radio dispatch terminal for a short period during the 1970s. A temporary holding facility was constructed but rarely used. The office was staffed by one part-time employee and served to take offense reports, answer routine inquiries, and coordinate local law enforcement presence in the village. The substation was closed in the mid-1970s.
*Lloyd&#x27;s Meat Market, located on Main Street between Railroad Avenue and Bourgeois Street in a wood and brick-framed structure. This butcher offered locally produced fresh seafood and meat from the 1960s until the early 1980s.
*The Patio Restaurant building, located on Main Street, north of Bridge Street, is a masonry facility that was the original location of LeLeux&#x27;s Pharmacy (circa 1980). The Patio Restaurant is a family-owned and -operated business that occupied this location for many years until the 21st century when it relocated nearer to New Iberia on Loreauville Road (Louisiana Highway 86) near the intersection of Sugar Oaks Road. The current business operating in this location is a family-owned restaurant, Teche Cafe.
*The Brown Derby, located on Main Street just north of Railroad Avenue, served adult refreshment from the mid-1960s until the mid-1970s. Several businesses operating in the same service have occupied the site since the original Brown Derby.
*Mestayer&#x27;s Grocery Store, located on the northwest corner of Main and Bridge streets. The family-owned grocery store operated from the 1950s until the early 1980s. The building remains and has hosted a number of businesses in the intervening years.
*Tan Vaughn&#x27;s Barber Shop, an extremely small (less than 200 square feet) wooden structure that was located at the intersection of Main Street and Railroad Avenue (southeast corner). Tan&#x27;s barbershop was in operation from the late 1940s until the early 1990s and contained a single barber chair, with two or three waiting chairs for customers. The structure was demolished in the 1990s and in its location is the Loreauville Town Hall.
*From the 1940s until it was removed in the mid-1980s, Loreauville had a Tin Man-style water tower adjacent to the Loreauville Volunteer Fire Department Fire Station on Bridge Street. The tower was located between the fire station and the bridge and held approximately 50,000 U.S. gallons of water. Its architectural style was reminiscent of the Tin Man in the movie &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Tin Man water towers continue to dot the increasingly urbanized landscape in America, but are rapidly disappearing as more modern and larger capacity water towers are constructed as their replacement. With the construction of the new water tower at the north end of the village in the early 1980s, the original Tin Man water tower was declared obsolete and torn down.
*Loreauville Movie Theater. This wood-framed structure was located on Main Street south of Bridge Street adjacent to Ed Broussard Marine Services. The structure is fondly remembered by many residents as providing entertainment during the late 1920s until after World War II. The movie theater transitioned from silent films through modern films with local residents providing the musical accompaniment during the silent film era. The structure was demolished and removed in the 1970s.
*Masso&#x27;s Cafe, located in a small wooden structure between the Ed Broussard Marine Service Company and Bridge Street. Masso&#x27;s was a small family-owned cafe operated by a local family. The cafe seated between 10 and 20 customers, with a small lunch counter that accommodated four to five customers. Masso&#x27;s Cafe was in operation from the mid-1950s until the late 1970s. The structure was demolished and removed during the late 1980s.
*Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church, located at the intersection of Daigre Street and Victory Drive. The present church building was erected in the 1970s to replace the original wooden church (later destroyed by fire in 1992) erected to serve the African-American community during the days of segregation.
*St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church Hall, located on Main Street immediately adjacent to St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church, has been used by area residents for weddings, wakes, celebrations, and meetings since its construction in the early 1960s. From the 1960s until the late 1980s, small school rooms in the rear of this facility were used to teach catechism to local residents. Near the entrance to the hall is a bronze plaque commemorating the services and life of Father Thomas Connors , a bilingual French/English priest from the Our Lady of La Salette Order (Missionaries of La Salette), who was assigned to St. Joseph&#x27;s parish in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Father Connors perished in a rectory fire in central Louisiana, and the parish hall was posthumously dedicated to him. A separate memorial to the vision of Our Lady of La Salette is in bronze in the front courtyard of St. Joseph&#x27;s church. The St. Joseph&#x27;s Church Hall remains in active use and serves as a frequent gathering place for many local residents.
*St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church, located on Main Street in the center of the village. The current building was constructed in the early 1960s and modernized over the years as its congregation grew and improvements were required. Memorial bronze plaques recognizing Loreauville residents who were killed in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War adorn the four-sided concrete base of the flagpole immediately in front of the church.
*Gondron&#x27;s Garage was a family-owned service station offering fuel services and comprehensive auto repair. The facility is located at the intersection of Main and Daigre streets.
*Loreauville Hospital, part of the rural network of hospitals in Louisiana, is located at the southern end of the village along the east side of Main Street (Louisiana Highway 86). The hospital opened in the early 1960s and operated until its closure in the 1980s. The site has had intermittent use as a health clinic in the intervening years. The original Loreauville clinic was located in a wood-framed structure in what is now the St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church parking lot. This facility operated in the post World War II period until its closure in 1963.

<text>New Iberia (; ) is the largest city in and the parish seat of Iberia Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana. The city of New Iberia is located approximately southeast of Lafayette, and forms part of the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area in the region of Acadiana. The 2020 United States census tabulated a population of 28,555. New Iberia is served by Amtrak’s &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;, operating between Los Angeles and New Orleans. New Iberia has a major four lane highway, being U.S. 90 (future Interstate 49), and has its own general aviation airfield, Acadiana Regional Airport. Scheduled passenger and cargo airline service is available via the nearby Lafayette Regional Airport located adjacent to U.S. 90 in Lafayette.

==History==

New Iberia dates its founding to the spring of 1779, when a group of some 500 colonists (&quot;Malagueños&quot;) from Spain, led by Lt. Col. Francisco Bouligny, came up Bayou Teche and settled around what became known as Spanish Lake.

The Spanish settlers called the town &quot;Nueva Iberia&quot; in honor of the Iberian Peninsula; French-speakers referred to the town as &quot;Nouvelle Ibérie&quot; while the English settlers arriving after the Louisiana Purchase called it &quot;New Town.&quot; In 1814, the U.S. government opened a post office in the town, officially recognizing the name as New Iberia, but postmarks from 1802 show the town being called “Nova Iberia” (Latin for &quot;new&quot;). The town was incorporated in 1839 as the &quot;Town of Iberia&quot;, but the state legislature amended the town&#x27;s charter in 1847, recognizing New Iberia as the town&#x27;s name.

In 1868, Iberia Parish was established, and New Iberia became the seat of parish government. At first, only rented space served for the courthouse. By 1884 a new courthouse was completed on a landscaped lot in downtown New Iberia, at the present-day site of Bouligny Plaza. In 1889, the Wakefield family, an African-American family from New Iberia fled to New Orleans after their son was lynched by a white mob; and days after the lynching, the family patriarch and former state senator Samuel Wakefield committed suicide on Howard Street. That courthouse served Iberia Parish until 1940. That year the current courthouse was built along Iberia Street, two blocks from the New Iberia downtown commercial district.

In September 2008, New Iberia was struck by Hurricane Ike. The lakes overflowed and filled the city, flooding it under several feet of dirty, brown water. On December 14, 2022, the southeastern part of the city was heavily damaged by a high-end EF2 tornado, injuring 16 people.

<doc id="115593" wikidata="Q2919487" url="?curid=115593" title="St. Gabriel, Louisiana">
<text>St. Gabriel is a city in Iberville Parish, Louisiana, United States. The city of St. Gabriel includes the Carville neighborhood and portions of Sunchine. Part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area, it had a population of 6,677 at the 2010 U.S. census, and 6,433 at the 2020 census.

St. Gabriel was incorporated as a town in 1994 and received city designation in 2001. It is located on the east bank of the Mississippi River, approximately 12 miles south of Baton Rouge. Bayou Manchac serves as the official boundary between St. Gabriel, Ascension Parish, and East Baton Rouge Parish. Over the years, the area has been transformed from a primarily agricultural economy to one that is now dominated by the petrochemical industry.

==History==
This area is in a part of Acadiana, which was founded by the Acadians, after their expulsion from Nova Scotia in the mid-18th century.

At the end of 1769 Luis de Unzaga, then governor of New Orleans and from 1770 also of Louisiana, authorized Father Dragobert to create a parish for the Acadians on land near the Mississippi and located between Baton Rouge, Iberville and the town of Gonzales. Between 1771 and 1773, Governor Luis de Unzaga granted the land and the necessary permits for its construction; the construction could be carried out between 1774 and 1776, still within the period of the government of Luis de Unzaga.

In 2008 during Hurricane Gustav, St. Gabriel Catholic Church&#x27;s steeple was destroyed. It is one of Louisiana&#x27;s oldest churches, and tradition sets the date of the formation of the parish in 1769.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 29.0 square miles (75.0 km), of which 28.7 square miles (74.4 km) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.6 km) (0.76%) is water. St. Gabriel sits along the east bank of the Mississippi River, between the boundaries of Ascension Parish and East Baton Rouge Parish. The city is about east of Baton Rouge and about from New Orleans. The communities of Carville and part of Sunshine are within the city limits.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 6,433 people, 1,635 households, and 962 families residing in the city. The population was 48.1% non-Hispanic Black, 38.3% non-Hispanic white, 0.5% non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native, 1.0% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.4% non-Hispanic some other race, 1.8% non-Hispanic multiracial, and 10.4% Hispanic of any race. The sharp decline of the Black population in the 2020 Census is the result of the closure and the evacuation of the population of the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women which sustained flooding damage in 2016.

At the 2000 United States census, there were 5,514 people, 898 households, and 639 families residing in the town. There were 898 households, out of which 35.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.0% were married couples living together, 26.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.8% were non-families. 25.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.79 and the average family size was 3.36. In 2019, there were 1,635 households with an average of 2.53 people per household. St. Gabriel had a median age of 37.7, and 88.2% of the population were aged 18 and older.

In 2019, the median household income was $48,259, up from $25,352 at the 2000 census. The per capita income was $17,153, up from $8,952 in 2000. Males had a median income of $41,125 versus $34,313 for females, and 20.0% of the population lived at or below the poverty line.

<doc id="115595" wikidata="Q2093663" url="?curid=115595" title="White Castle, Louisiana">
<text>White Castle is a town in Iberville Parish, Louisiana, United States. At the 2010 U.S. census the town population was 1,883, and 1,640 at the 2020 population estimates program. It is part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan area.

== History ==
The town of White Castle was carved out of the George Wailes plantation &quot;White Castle&quot;. The 1883 Charles H. Dickinson Survey of several parishes of Louisiana shows the White Castle Plantation property. Nearby is the antebellum mansion Nottoway Plantation.

White Castle was established as a town in the 1880s with the influx of people and business brought by the logging industry in the cypress swamps of the area. When the cypress wood was depleted, the main economic activity reverted to the sugar cane industry which had been established in the latter part of the 18th century.

Individual plantation sugar mills gave way to larger mills servicing many plantations. By 1970, White Castle had three major sugar mills, Cora Texas, Cedar Grove, and Catherine/Supples. Only one, Cora Texas located just south of White Castle on LA 1, is still in operation. Antebellum plantation homes in the area are Nottoway, Tally-ho, among others.

People living in the unincorporated areas of Samstown, Lone Star, Belle Grove, Dorseyville, and as far away as Bayou Goula helped support White Castle businesses through the years. At one time, there were three car dealerships, Dufour Chevrolet, White Castle Motor company (Ford), and Dixie Sales and Service(Chrysler/Plymouth); three drug stores, Hebert&#x27;s, Viallon&#x27;s, and Bajon&#x27;s; Weils and Shaheens clothing stores; Agosta Shoe Store; Eskine&#x27;s Jewelry; and two lumber yards, Baudoin&#x27;s and Tassin&#x27;s. Engolio&#x27;s Maggio&#x27;s, Chiaramonte, Dominic Sciortino, Tina&#x27;s, Forte&#x27;s, and Landry&#x27;s were used for grocery shopping. Big-screen entertainment was provided by Castle Theater until 1959, when it was closed.

During the 1950s, the chemical industry entered the area, congregating around the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This industry brought economic growth which took White Castle into the 1980s. Companies establishing chemical plants in the area near White Castle were Dow Chemical north of Plaquemine, Georgia-Gulf and Hercules north of White Castle, and Ciba-Geigy on the east bank of the Mississippi.

Population levels have remained between 1,900 and 2,200 for the last forty years, within the White Castle town limits. The surrounding unincorporated areas have seen an increase in population.

<text>Eros is a town in Jackson Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 130 at the 2020 Census It is part of the Ruston Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Tremont Lumber company founded Eros, in the early 20th century. Mrs. Mary Collins, née Nash (wife of Samuel Collins) suggested that the sawmill boomtown be named after the 433 Eros Asteroid (discovered in 1898). Eros served as a center point for a number of small surrounding communities, such as Hog Hair, Jumping Vernon, Indian Village, Salem Guyton, Flat Creek, Head Settlement, Vernon, Fuller Town, and Bug Tussle. Most children in these communities were sent to study at the Eros school, and citizens would normally receive their mail through rural mail coming from Eros. Box suppers would be held for various causes, making Eros a social center.

Naturally by 1920, the town became the largest in the Jackson Parish, with &quot;a thousand residents, having a post office, three hotels, a newspaper, a company commissary, three doctors, a drug store, three churches, a jail, a bank, its own telephone exchange and Jackson Parish&#x27;s first high school with six hundred pupils&quot; (Busbice, 6). A cyclone though devastated the town in 1920, destroying the sawmill. The sawmill was rebuilt, but yet again in 1926 a fire burned it to the ground. After that, the mill company felt that most of the timber had been harvested anyway, and moved their center of operation to Olla, Louisiana. Only a few hundred citizens stayed to maintain the town.

<text>Jonesboro () is a town in, and the parish seat of, Jackson Parish in the northern portion of the U.S. state of Louisiana. The population was 4,106 in 2020.

==History==
Founded on January 10, 1860, by Joseph Jones and his wife, Sarah Pankey Jones, as a small family farm, Jonesboro is now a small industrial mill town. Originally founded as &quot;Macedonia,&quot; the small town&#x27;s name changed to Jonesboro on January 16, 1901, after the United States Post Office Department approved the change and became the seat of government for Jackson Parish on March 15, 1911, following a parish-wide referendum. Jonesboro remains the parish&#x27;s agricultural, industrial, economic, and governmental center.

During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, whites violently resisted African-American efforts to gain their constitutional rights as citizens, even after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Ku Klux Klan, which was active in the area, conducted what was called a &quot;reign of terror&quot; in 1964, including harassment of activists, &quot;the burning of crosses on the lawns of African-American voters,&quot; murder, and destroying five black churches by fire, as well as their Masonic hall, and a Baptist center.

In November 1964, Earnest &quot;Chilly Willy&quot; Thomas and Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick (the latter ordained that year as a minister of the Church of God in Christ), founded the Deacons for Defense and Justice in Jonesboro. It was an armed self-defense group, largely made up of men who were World War II and Korean War veterans. At night, they conducted regular patrols of the city&#x27;s black community which occupied an area known as &quot;the Quarters&quot;. They protected civil rights activists and their families during and outside demonstrations. At the request of activists in Bogalusa, another mill town where blacks were under pressure from violent whites, Thomas and Kirkpatrick helped found an affiliated chapter in that city. Ultimately there were 21 chapters in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, operating through 1968. In Jonesboro, the Deacons achieved some changes, such as integrating parks and a swimming pool. Activists achieved more after congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and their entry into politics.

==Geography==
Jonesboro is in southwestern Jackson Parish. U.S. Route 167 passes through the town&#x27;s northern and eastern sides, leading north to Ruston and south to Winnfield. Louisiana Highway 4 passes through the center of Jonesboro, leading east to Chatham and west to Lucky.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Jonesboro has an area of , of which are land and , or 1.17%, are water. Jonesboro water bodies drain north to the Little Dugdemona River, which turns southwest and forms the southward-flowing Dugdemona River.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 4,106 people, 1,374 households, and 754 families residing in the town.

==Government==
The city has a mayor-council form of government; all persons are elected. Independent Dr. James Spoke Harris was inaugurated on December 31, 2022 Democrat James E. Bradford was inaugurated on December 29, 2014.

The previous mayor, Leslie Cornell Thompson, was suspended from office in September 2013 after being convicted of malfeasance in office. As of 2013, Jonesboro had not had a budget since 2008. His wife, Yoshi Chambers Thompson, was initially appointed by the city council to succeed him as interim mayor. Her legitimacy was questioned by Kenneth David Folden, the fiscal administrator appointed by the state the day after Thompson&#x27;s conviction to bring city finances back into order. Tammy Sheridan Lee, the Monroe city judge who administered the oath to Yoshi Thompson, has withdrawn the authorization. Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell is reviewing the legality of the situation.

Meanwhile, Judge James Cecil &quot;Jimmy&quot; Teat of the Louisiana 2nd Judicial District Court in Jonesboro ruled that Thompson had violated the conditions of his bond through continued interference in municipal business. Judge Teat ordered Thompson to be incarcerated in the Jackson Parish Correctional Center until his sentencing on the malfeasance charges.

A Democrat, Thompson had been elected mayor on October 2, 2010, with 82votes 4 (57.6 percent) to the Republican candidate, Freddie Brown&#x27;s, 607 (42.4 percent).

On October 17, 2013, based on the conviction of malfeasance, Judge Teat sentenced Mayor Thompson to six years of hard labor, large fines, $51,000 in restitution to the city of Jonesboro, five years&#x27; suspended sentence, and five years of supervised probation. Thompson will remain incarcerated pending appeal.

In the runoff election for mayor held on December 8, 2018, Thompson unseated Bradford.

<doc id="115606" wikidata="Q2461688" url="?curid=115606" title="Jennings, Louisiana">
<text>Jennings is a city in, and the parish seat of, Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana, United States, near Lake Charles. The population was 10,383 at the 2010 census, a small decline from the 2000 tabulation.

Jennings is the principal city of the Jennings Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Jefferson Davis Parish. It is also part of the larger Lake Charles-Jennings Combined Statistical Area. It is also part of the large, 22-parish Acadiana region of the state, with a large Francophone population, many descended from early Acadian settlers.

==History==

For whom the town was named, Jennings McComb was an Irish contractor for the Southern Pacific Railroad. He built the Jennings depot on a divide peculiar to the southwest Louisiana. This became the center of new development based on the railroad. The first settler was recorded as A. D. McFarlain, who came in 1881 from St. Mary Parish and opened a store. McFarlain also became the first rice grower, postmaster, brickmaker, and builder in the community. Prospering with Jennings’ growth, McFarlain was considered one of the town&#x27;s prominent businessmen and civic leaders.

The Jennings area attracted numerous wheat farmers from Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and other Midwestern states. The new settlers of southwest Louisiana were referred to as &quot;Yankees&quot; by the natives, who were of Acadian French and African-American descent. They had settled along the waterways in the parish, which they had relied on for transportation before the railroad. They fished in the bayous. The Cajuns gave appreciable aid to the settlers in homesteading and homemaking. The people grew rice, cotton, sweet potatoes, and corn.

Sylvester L. Cary reached this area on February 7, 1883, from Iowa. He became known as the town&#x27;s &quot;father,&quot; as he persuaded other Iowans to relocate there. He said he was &quot;seeking a home where there was neither winter nor mortgages.&quot; So impressed was Cary by the fertile country around the Jennings depot that he shared his findings with others. He attracted fellow Midwesterners to southwest Louisiana by writing to friends in Iowa, extolling the area. When he returned to Iowa to pack up his family for the move to Jennings, he persuaded several neighbors preparing to migrate west, to follow him to Jennings and southwest Louisiana.

Much of southwest Louisiana was developed by the North American Land and Timber Co., which owned large portions of land. Seaman A. Knapp, president of the Iowa State College of Agriculture, was engaged in 1885 to demonstrate the region&#x27;s suitability for rice production. Knapp attracted a number of Iowans to settle the area. The land company placed advertisements in newspapers published in the Midwestern states.

On May 2, 1888, the settlement of Jennings was incorporated as a village. In 1901, a fire destroyed a large portion of the wooden structures in Jennings.

That same year, Jennings was the site of the first oil well to produce in Louisiana, revealing its first oil field. Oil brought a boom to the town for a period. When oil production declined, the basic agricultural economy of the parish supported the town.

<doc id="115607" wikidata="Q2416227" url="?curid=115607" title="Lake Arthur, Louisiana">
<text>Lake Arthur is a town in Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 2,738 at the 2010 census, down from 3,007 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Jennings Micropolitan Statistical Area. The current mayor is Sampson “poncho” Lejeune.

==History==
 The lake and the abundant wildlife near Lake Arthur made the place an early camping ground for Native Americans, most likely Atakapas, although there were also Comanche Indians in the area at times during the era just before European settlement. Before Lake Arthur, first settled was a little village that was south and across the lake called Lakeside and also the area called Shell Beach.

Acadian families moved to the area in the late 1700s. They called the lake le petit lac Mentau. &quot;Mentau&quot; was the name of an Atakapas Indian chief who had lived in the area. One of those early Acadians was Arthur LeBlanc, and travelers passing through the country began to refer to the lake as le lac d&#x27;Arthur, and through time, it evolved into the present name, Lake Arthur.
&quot;In 1811 Atanas Hebert came to Lake Arthur to settle. That marks a date we can follow with accuracy.&quot; The first store was operated by D. D. Hebert.

1840 The first sawmill was established in the area. Cypress timber drew most of the early people.
1854 Gustave Laurents owned and operated a store. Early settlers were noble Creoles from New Orleans. Jean Revlon built a large residence in 1854. Today it is known as MacDonell plantation. The deLaunays, Deschamps and Gaithes, all who were in the French Revolution came from New Orleans.

At first, they grew corn and other crops, but found that rice was the crop to grow.&lt;br&gt; 
1876 The first rice mill was built by Gustave Laurents and D. Derouen.&lt;br&gt;
1887 Anatole Gauthier and C. St Germain brought in the first rice thresher and portable steam boiler.&lt;br&gt; 
1890 The first rice irrigation pumping plant was built on Bayou Lacassine. All of this turned Lake Arthur into successful rice country.

One of the largest families in the area was Broussard. It is almost impossible to pinpoint which one arrived first. T.E. Theogene Broussard was a druggist in Lake Arthur.

1878 The first post office was opened with D. Derouen as postmaster. Mail was received once a month from Leesburg (Cameron), and once in a while by horseback from Lake Charles.

1889 Construction of The Live Oak Hotel was well on its way by 1888. Construction was completed in February 1889. One of its guests was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who came to Lake Arthur to hunt before he was stricken by polio. The Live Oak was maintained and operated as a private hotel until 1922, when it was sold to the Lake Arthur Hunting Club. It was torn down in 1934.
Boat captains were an important part of early settlers lives. The lake is about one mile wide and nine miles long and connects with the Mermentau River, a waterway to the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;br&gt;
1886 D. E. Sweet bought the &quot;Louisa Storm&quot; and &quot;Olive&quot; which made trips to Grand Chenier for 17 years. This was that only means of travel between Lake Arthur and Cameron Parish.

A lumber boom began not long after the town was laid out, with two sawmills. Lumber barons were Aaron Streater and Pete Reimers.&lt;br&gt; 
1890 Lee Fox built the first sawmill within the Lake Arthur corporate limits; it was destroyed by fire in 1905, as was the Brewer, Reynolds and Streater Mill that had been built on the lake front in 1900. Besides the mills, lumber covering several acres went up in smoke. More than 5 million feet of cypress lumber was lost.

1890 The Lake Arthur Town Lot and Land Co. planned the original town. This company was composed of Samuel Marquet, E. L. Lee, W. E. Chapin, and H. C. Kellog. These men were all from the state of Iowa. Later, Samuel Marquet bought all the interest in the town site.
1903 A petition signed by a majority of the land holders was submitted to the governor asking that Lake Arthur be incorporated as a village. Names on the petition for incorporation were Dr. V. A. Miller, E. S. Streater, F. A. Smith, J. H. Jeppeson, George S. Wheeler, A. D. Spooner, Nick Arend, H. E. Sergrist, John L. Walter, A. G. Streater, F. R Gibbs, P. T. Reimers, John Lovell, L. N. Toups, M. Broussard, J. F. Ney, W.H. Ney, J. F. Kestner, George Bailey, and T. E. Broussard. Lake Arthur was incorporated in 1904, and Dr. Miller was chosen as its first mayor.
1904 Southern Pacific Railroad came from Lake Charles.

1922 Lake Arthur was made an independent parish by Bishop Jules B. Jeanmard of Lafayette. Rev. W. E. Allen was the first pastor of Our Lady of the Lake Parish. He retired in 1935, and Rev. L. E deMonsabert was made pastor.

Today Lake Arthur citizens are a mixture of Acadians and French, and Anglo-Americans who arrived from the state of Iowa during the 1890s.

==Geography==
The town is in southeastern Jefferson Davis Parish, on the north shore of Lake Arthur, a tidal section of the Mermentau River. The town limits extend into the center of the lake, which is the Vermilion Parish line. Louisiana Highway 14 passes through the town center, leading west to Lake Charles. To the east Highway 14 crosses the Mermentau River at its mouth then leads to Abbeville. Louisiana Highway 26 has its southern terminus in Lake Arthur and leads north to Jennings.

<text>Estelle is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 17,952 in 2020. It is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area.

Estelle is located south of Marrero; the urbanized areas of the communities meet, and some businesses in Estelle list their addresses as &quot;Marrero&quot;. The Jean Lafitte National Park Barataria Preserve is adjacent to Estelle.

==History==
Part of the colonial era Isleño Barataria Settlement was in the southern part of what is now Estelle. Estelle became the location of the WWL-AM transmitter.

==Geography==
Estelle is located at (29.847527, -90.108117). It is bordered to the north by Marrero and to the east by Woodmere. It is by highway or in a straight line southwest of downtown New Orleans. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.18%, are water.

==Demographics==

The 2019 American Community Survey estimated 17,968 people lived in the CDP, up from 16,377 at the 2010 U.S. census. At the 2020 United States census, there were 17,952 people in the CDP. In 2019, the racial and ethnic makeup was 50.5% non-Hispanic white, 26.6% Black or African American, 0.2% Native American, 6.2% Asian, 6.6% some other race, 3.5% multiracial, and 12.3% Hispanic and Latino American of any race. The 2020 census determined 47.18% of its population was non-Hispanic white, 27.77% Black or African American, 0.79% Native American, 5.58% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 4.66% two or more races, and 14.0% Hispanic and Latino American of any race. The growth of the Asian American and Hispanic or Latino American population in the CDP and others in Jefferson Parish have reflected the greater diversification of the U.S. following non-Hispanic white demographic decline. The median household income was $68,051 and 14.3% of the population were at or below the poverty line in 2019.

==Education==
Residents are assigned to schools in the Jefferson Parish Public Schools system.

K-8 schools that include portions of Estelle include: Allen Ellender, Estelle, Congetta Trippe Janet, and Harry Truman. A portion in the north of the CDP is zoned to Pittman Elementary, and Marrero Middle School. Most residents are zoned to John Ehret High School, while some are zoned to L.W. Higgins High School in Marrero.

In regards to advanced studies academies, residents are zoned to the Marrero Academy.

Previously Ellender was solely a middle school, and Estelle was divided between Ellender and Truman at the middle school level. Therefore, Ellender did not serve any portions of Estelle at the elementary level. In the mid-2010s, Miller Wall Elementary in Marrero included parts of Estelle. Schools that served Estelle for middle school in the mid-2010s were Ellender PK-8, Truman Middle in Estelle, and Worley Middle in Harvey.

<text>Grand Isle is a town in Jefferson Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana, located on a barrier island of the same name in the Gulf of Mexico. The island is at the mouth of Barataria Bay where it meets the Gulf. The town of Grand Isle is statistically part of the New Orleans−Metairie−Kenner metropolitan statistical area, though it is not connected to New Orleans&#x27; continuous urbanized area.

The population was 1,005 as of the 2020 U.S. census, down from 1,296 from the previous 2010 U.S. census.

Grand Isle&#x27;s main street is the seaside start of Louisiana Highway 1 (LA 1), which stretches away to the northwest corner of the state, ending near Shreveport. LA 1&#x27;s automobile causeway at the west end of the island is the only land access to or from Grand Isle. Direct access to Grand Isle&#x27;s seat of parish government is away in the more suburban part of Jefferson Parish.

== History ==
Grand Isle has been repeatedly pummeled by hurricanes throughout its history. On average, the town and barrier island of Grand Isle has been affected by tropical storms or hurricanes every 2.68 years (since 1877), with direct hits on average every 7.88 years. Some of the more severe are listed here.

In 1860, a storm surge and great winds resulted in the total devastation of the island. In the 1893 Atlantic hurricane season Grand Isle was devastated by a storm surge. In the 1909 Atlantic hurricane season the island was hit with a second storm surge. A category 4 hurricane devastated Grand Isle on September 29 during the 1915 Atlantic hurricane season. Grand Isle was hit by a storm surge on August 22 during the 1947 Atlantic hurricane season. In 1956, Hurricane Flossy damaged the island.

Hurricane Betsy in September 1965 and Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 put the entire island under water. On September 26, 2002, Grand Isle was hit by Hurricane Isidore, soon followed by Hurricane Lili passing to the west of the island, causing significant damage. Hurricane Cindy made a direct hit on Grand Isle on July 5, 2005. Even though damage was essentially limited to power outages and beach erosion, the storm&#x27;s strength still caught residents by surprise.

Hurricane Katrina pounded Grand Isle for two days, August 28–29, 2005, destroying or damaging homes and camps along the entire island. Katrina&#x27;s surge reached at Grand Isle. Large waves severely damaged the only bridge linking Grand Isle to the mainland. A news report published less than two days after the hurricane hit falsely noted, however, that the area had been completely destroyed, reporting a scene similar to that which befell Last Island in 1856. Less than a month later, Grand Isle was further affected by Hurricane Rita. By mid October, a number of businesses were again open on the island.

Hurricane Gustav reached shore west of the island on September 1, 2008, at 9 am CDT, and hit it with a measured wind speed of . It was one of the few locations in Louisiana affected while the storm was still classified as a major hurricane. While both storms&#x27; eyes passed the island at similar distances, Katrina&#x27;s eastern passing caused the greatest damage on the bay side. The Gustav surge that washed over the island caused less damage than Katrina, in part due to the most vulnerable structures having already been destroyed by Katrina. Current construction codes prevented the rebuilding of such vulnerable structures. Barataria Pass water levels peaked at above recent high tide. Homes along Louisiana Highway 1 had of water below them. Large sections of levee/dunes were washed onto the highway.

Hurricane Ike passed far south of the island on September 11, 2008, while crews worked to restore power and repair the levee/dune damage caused by Gustav. Some sections of LA 1 west of the island were covered by of water. Wind gusts reached and Barataria Pass water levels reached above recent high tide while Ike was away.

Hurricane Ida&#x27;s eastern eye wall hit the area on August 29, 2021, on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, causing widespread damage. It was reported that 100 percent of Grand Isle&#x27;s structures were damaged, and around 40–50 percent of structures were completely destroyed. Nearly all of the town&#x27;s utility poles had either bent or collapsed from the extreme winds. Entergy decided to fully rebuild and strengthen the island&#x27;s power grid instead of repairing it like most communities north of Grand Isle had received.

===Restoration===
In 1998, the state of Louisiana and its federal and local partners approved a coastal restoration project called Coast 2050: Toward a Sustainable Coast. It is a $14 billion fund that is hoped to be allocated over 50 years in around 77 restoration projects with the aim of creating a sustainable ecosystem of coastal Louisiana. While the plan focuses on all of Louisiana, restoration of the Barataria Basin was the first priority and Grand Isle is at the mouth of Barataria Bay. On February 18, 2000, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources signed an agreement to initiate a restoration plan to this basin. The loss of wetland in Barataria Bay is estimated at 11 square miles per year from 1978 to 1990 (Fuller et al. 1995). Most strategies in the Barataria Basin region depend on the overall input, movement, and circulation of water, sediment, and nutrients in the basin. Other strategies can be implemented independently of these considerations. These include barrier shoreline restoration, marsh creation in the southwestern basin, and a delta-building diversion from the lower Mississippi. The completion of Coast 2050 was to restore and protect 450,000 acres of wetland. U.S. Congress had not approved the Coast 2050 plan, and when Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita hit, the federal government was studying a less costly, scaled down proposal which could be initiated in the span of a decade.

In April 2009, the Mississippi River Sediment Delivery System was proposed to channel dredged sediment from the Mississippi River to the wetlands in South Louisiana to restore of tidal marsh. Approximately 200 million tons of sediment flows down the Mississippi River annually, of which the Army Corps of Engineers dredges about 60 million cubic yards of the sediment to maintain Louisiana&#x27;s waterways. According to the project documents, if successful, the Sediment Delivery system could potentially create of marsh a year and reduce wetland losses by as much as two-thirds. The dredged sediment will be piped to Bayou Dupont via a pipe, to a area of open water and broken marsh. Once the area has been adequately filled, it will be planted with marsh grasses. It is estimated that the project will cost $28 million and be completed by August 2009.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put up $3 million in the summer of 2009 in federal stimulus grants to restore a protective marsh that will shield the island from backwater flooding. The money will help Grand Isle strengthen its natural defenses, provide better hurricane protection, while also preserving a critical barrier island that buffers inland parishes from the full force of hurricanes. In 2009, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources used $3 million to dredge sediment from the Mississippi River and create of tidal marsh. Not only will the marsh help support recreational and commercial fisheries by providing a healthy habitat, officials said, but it will also buffer the island and reduce storm surge and flooding.

Also in 2009, the Nature Conservancy received a $4 million grant for its Grand Isle shoreline-restoration project, which will create four miles of oyster reefs along the beach in Grand Isle and Biloxi Marsh. (see oyster reef restoration) The frames eventually grow into oyster reefs that buffer the shore and create productive ocean habitats for fish. Once these reefs have fully restored themselves, they will also help filter the water. The Nature Conservancy hope that these oysters colonize on breakwater structures and that the space on these breakwater structures increase biodiversity.

In response the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, the Coalition and the National Wildlife Foundation organized the planting of more than 1,600 mangroves in Grand Isle State Park on June 25, 2011. They hope that this planting will help stabilize the sediment and sand and provide habitat for wildlife, specifically pelicans.

On September 29, 2012, the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana (CRCL) and the Abita Brewing Company partnered together to bring out more than 100 volunteers to help restore and protect the beach dunes at Grand Isle State Park in response to Hurricane Isaac. It was the first project undertaken in Grand Isle since Hurricane Issac made landfall. Volunteers installed dune fences and planted more than 12,000 plugs of dune grass. This will help stabilize the fragile beach along Grand Isle. Abita Beer and CRCL together implemented this and other restoration projects which will directly restore dune habitat and strengthen Grand Isle State Park and other sites in the future.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town covered a total area of , of which is land and (20.88%) is water.

===Climate===

Grand Island has a humid subtropical climate with mild winters and long, hot, humid summers.

===Coastal protections===
In 2010, the United States Army Corps of Engineers installed an artificial levee along the island&#x27;s southern coast that cost $ and measures long, tall, and wide. The core of the levee consists of an geotextile tube core that gives the levee its nickname of the &quot;Burrito Levee&quot;. The tube is filled with of sand pumped from the gulf floor. In 2017, Jefferson Parish declared a state of emergency over the levee&#x27;s disrepair and exposed core. The levee has been damaged by multiple storms, including Tropical Storm Cristobal and Hurricane Zeta in 2020 and Hurricane Ida in 2021.

==Demographics==


At the 2000 U.S. census, 1,541 people, 622 households, and 436 families lived in the town.

The population density was . There were 1,875 housing units at an average density of . In 2000, there were 622 households, out of which 29.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.2% were married couples living together, 8.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.9% were non-families. The U.S. Census Bureau tabulated that 24.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 2.89.

The median income for a household in the town was $33,548, and the median income for a family was $35,517. Males had a median income of $34,000 versus $19,333 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,330. About 9.1% of families and 13.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.3% of those under age 18 and 12.9% of those age 65 or over.

At the 2019 American Community Survey, there were 2,038 housing units and 214 were owner-occupied; there were 184 families in the town.

==Government==
The United States Postal Service operates a post office in Grand Isle.

== Arts and culture ==


Fishing is an important part of Grand Isle&#x27;s culture, with more than 280 species of fish in the surrounding waters. In 1928, the annual Grand Isle Tarpon Rodeo, fishing tournament, was established on the island and is now one of the premier salt water fishing rodeos in the United States. The Cajun rodeo draws over 15,000 people annually.

The island also has well maintained beaches. Grand Isle State Park, on the east end of the island, is the only state-owned and operated beach on the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The beach is a popular destination for people living in South Louisiana, and is also one of the only locations in Louisiana where people surf. A local surf club also exists, established in 2017, and rents out surf boards and gives surf lessons.

The island is home to the Coast Guard Station Grand Isle located on the eastern end of the island.

===Grand Isle Migratory Bird Festival===

The Grand Isle Migratory Bird Festival, held annually in April, was first established in 1997 by several nature organizations dedicated to the preservation and restoration of the Grand Isle&#x27;s chenier habitat. The idea for the project of preserving and establishing the chenier habitat in order for tourists and bird watchers to see the migratory birds was first established by the Grand Isle Community Development Team. The project was then picked up a year later by the Barataria-Terrebonne Nation Estuary Program to help in the development and preservation of the habitat as well as the advertisement of the Grand Isle Migratory Bird Festival.

Originally, the festival was held on a single day, but due to increased popularity and funding, the festival has grown into a three-day event. Sponsors of the Grand Isle Migratory Bird Festival believe that future efforts will be more successful if more people are educated about not only the identification of the birds that migrate through the island, but also the identification and importance of the plants the birds utilize. Each day during the festival, multiple tours are given throughout the diverse habitats of Grand Isle where experienced guides instruct beginner birders on the different techniques used to find and identify birds as well as the ecological aspects of the island. Other tours are offered that guide visitors through the chenier forests and teach them about the native plants found on the island, including the species that are not only edible to birds but to people as well. Other features of the festival include bird banding and mist netting demonstrations, seminars on what to look for when choosing a pair of binoculars or a spotting scope, as well as games and other activities.

Described as a barrier island, Grand Isle consists of mainly marsh habitat, beaches and chenier forests which attract numerous species of migratory birds. The presence of these hardwood forests allows for the seasonal arrival and departure of major flocks of birds that migrate across the Gulf of Mexico to South America during both the fall and spring migrations. The Migratory Bird Festival is held annually and coincides with the arrival of the spring migrants returning from their winter habitat in the south.

===Chenier habitat===

Chenier habitats are not limited to Grand Isle, but were historically found in wetlands throughout the southeastern coasts of Louisiana called the Chenier Plain. Today, the Chenier Plain consists of uplands, wetlands, and open water that extends from Vermilion Bay, Louisiana to East Bay, Texas. Of the original that had existed, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 square acres remain. Chenier forests consist of hardwood trees, primarily oaks and hackberries, as well as a variety of other vegetation such as mulberry, honeylocust, water oak, green ash, and American elm, all which grow along slightly elevated ridges. These ridges are the result of the build-up of sediment from periodic shifts of the Mississippi River&#x27;s delta and can range in size from high and between wide. Because of the slightly higher elevation, chenier forests not only allow for the growth of hardwood trees that support the variety of migratory birds that pass through Grand Isle, but also act as a barrier for salt water intrusion into a marsh during storm surges. Typically, marshes that are north of a chenier are less saline than marshes that are closer to the gulf.

The cover of a chenier forest provides for migratory birds a place to rest before or after making the flight across the Gulf of Mexico and in some species of birds, the habitat is essential for breeding. However, some studies suggest that it is not just the cover that habitats like chenier forests provide that attract migratory birds, but it is the food availability that is the principal factor in migratory bird stopover. Stopover is a term used for when flocks of migratory birds pause in a certain area to rest and/or feed. Studies have shown that significant stopover occurs more frequently as flocks of migratory birds near the coast. There is a correlation between large densities of birds occurring in continuous hardwood forests, such as old-growth cheniers. Studies done on forest cover indicate that as the amount of cover increased, arthropod abundance and the presence of fleshy, fruit bearing vegetation increased as well, and that migratory birds use forest cover as an indicator of greater habitat quality, thus a better food source per impending journey across the Gulf of Mexico.

===Grand Isle Birding Trail===

The birding trails along Grand Isle consists of nearly sixty acres of marsh and chenier habitat and are divided up into six tracts that are managed by the Louisiana Nature Conservancy and the Grand Isle Community Development Team. The trails mainly consist of tracts procured by the Grand Isle Nature Conservancy or donated by local landowners. However, because some of the boundaries of the tracts are partially fragmented, the chenier habitat can sometimes expand into private property. But due to the increased popularity of the Migratory Bird Festival, private landowners will generally allow bird watchers and ornithologists permission onto their land. Some residents will go as far as to post signs that say &quot;Bird Friendly&quot; as a way to invite bird watchers onto their property.
The Grilleta Tract was established by a donation of ten acres by the Xavier Grilleta of B&amp;G Services in 1998. In 2001, an additional three acres were acquired that were adjacent to the original property. Although slightly smaller than the Port Commission Marsh, the Grilleta Tract is mostly chenier habitat and is considered the center of the Grand Isle Birding Trail. This stand of forest is one of only two undisturbed chenier forests that still exist on the island. In addition to live oaks, in which a few are over 125 years old, the area supports a variety of trees and shrubs, including red mulberry, black willow, and red bay.

The Grand Isle Port Commission Tract is roughly 22 acres and is located on the western part of the island at the corner of Ludwig Lane. Two hundred eighty feet of boardwalk allow access to the salt marsh tidal ponds that dominate the area. In this tract, birders can spot a variety of passerines, raptors, colonial birds roosting in the sparse chenier habitat, and wading birds. The second largest stretch of forest is a combination of the Maples tract and the Landry-Leblanc tract. It is locally called the Sureway Woods, as it is near the Sureway Supermarket. Together, the Maples tract and the Landry-LeBlanc tract comprise twenty acres of chenier forest.

The remaining two tracts on the island consist of the Cemetery Woods, which is property of Louisiana State University, and the Govan Tract. The Cemetery Woods is roughly four and a half acres and, like the Grilleta Tract, it contains old growth trees that are over 125 years old. In addition to the hardwood forest, the property contains salt flats and marshland, which promote the habitation of ducks, moorhens, grebes, and other wading birds. The Govan Tract was donated to the Nature Conservancy in 2003 by the Govan family, who had owned it since the late 1800s. The tract only consists of half an acre, but within it, the mass availability of lives oaks, hackberries, dewberry, and poison oak attracts birds such as painted buntings, red-winged blackbirds, warblers, and other passerines that can be seen during the migratory season.

In addition to the Grand Isle Birding Trail, bird watchers can also see marine birds such as gulls, terns, pelicans, and other shorebirds from the Grand Isle State Park at the northeast end of the island.

<text>Gretna is the second-largest city in, and parish seat of, Jefferson Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana. Gretna lies on the west bank of the Mississippi River, just east and across the river from uptown New Orleans. It is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area. The population was 17,814 at the 2020 U.S. census.

==History==
According to the history published by the city, Gretna&#x27;s history can be traced to a plantation established by Jean-Charles de Pradel by 1750 (when the plantation house, &quot;Monplaisir&quot;, was built). By 1813, the plantation had passed into the hands of one François Bernoudy. John McDonogh (also spelled John McDonough), then a resident of New Orleans, bought the establishment, moved into the house and founded a settlement in 1815, that would be named McDonoghville. He subdivided the rest of the former plantation into regular city lots and 30-arpent farming strips. McDonoghville thus became the first subdivision in Jefferson Parish. McDonough either leased or sold these properties to white laborers or free people of color.

Gretna was settled in 1836, originally as Mechanikham, growing with a station on the Mississippi River for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, Texas and Pacific Railway, and Southern Pacific Railroad, with a ferry across the River to New Orleans. The famous food and spice company Zatarain&#x27;s, founded in 1889 in New Orleans, has been located in Gretna since 1963. Gretna was incorporated in 1913, absorbing the section of McDonogh within the Jefferson Parish boundaries. In the 1940 census, Gretna had a population of 10,879.

===Hurricane Katrina controversy===

The city and its police received considerable press coverage when, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, people who attempted to escape from New Orleans by walking over the Crescent City Connection bridge over the Mississippi River were turned back at gunpoint by City of Gretna Police, along with Crescent City Connection Police, and Jefferson Parish Sheriff&#x27;s deputies, who set up a roadblock on the bridge in the days following the hurricane. According to eyewitnesses, some officers threatened to shoot those coming from New Orleans as they attempted to cross into Gretna on foot, shots were fired overhead, and downdraft from a police helicopter was used to help clear refugees from the bridge. New Orleans Police Department 911 operator Patryce Jenkins, having walked the city for two days after her dispatch center was flooded, tried to return to her unflooded Gretna apartment via the bridge. Though she had ID to prove her status as a resident, she said instead of checking it police ordered her to turn back, used racial slurs, and fired a warning shot over her head, leaving her crying in disbelief.

Gretna mayor Ronnie Harris pointed out though the city had not flooded, Gretna had been severely damaged as well, losing power, water, and sewage services, claiming the city had no food, no water, no shelters, and no capacity to take refugees. Harris said that the city had commandeered buses and been transporting a crowd of about 6,000 refugees to a nearby FEMA facility. But he said the city enacted the blockade after a spate of door-to-door robberies began in Gretna and stores at the Oakwood Mall were looted and burned. Residents of Gretna were themselves required to evacuate after a few days. Four federal civil lawsuits were filed against the city for violation of civil rights. Two were dismissed, and in a third the Jefferson Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Office settled with a family from Algiers for $10,000. A fourth federal case, involving Regional Transit Authority workers, was scheduled to go to trial in April 2011. Several other cases were filed in New Orleans Civil District Court.

<text>Harahan is a city in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana; it is a suburb of New Orleans. Its population was 9,116 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Harahan occupies land which was once part of the Soniat Plantation. The area was historically known for ideal conditions to use as farming and raising cattle. In the late 1800s, part of the former plantation was used as an experimental farm operated by Southern University and A&amp;M College.

Non-agricultural development began in 1894, when the Illinois Central Railroad (now Canadian National) built a repair yard and roundhouse adjacent to the current city hall. In 1914, the Harahan Land Company, composed of ICRR officials, bought the Southern University tract of land and subdivided it. Residents included railroad workers, river workers and truck farmers. The village of Harahan was incorporated in 1920–named after James Theodore Harahan, the ICRR President.

Prior to the Huey P. Long Bridge being built, Harahan was one of few points on the entire Mississippi River where railcars could cross. The Illinois Central and Southern Pacific Railroads maintained a ferry crossing between Harahan and Avondale to carry their railroad cars across the Mississippi River. To reach this ferry, the rail cars traveled up an incline that brought them over the river levee. The three largest barges in the world, the Mastodon, the Mammoth and El Grande once called Harahan home.

In 1908, the Colonial Country Club was built and occupied the old Soniat Plantation home. By 1910, Wedell-Williams on the eastern edge of Harahan, had become the de facto New Orleans airport, and aviation pioneer John Moisant died there in a plane accident while preparing for a competition. Shortly thereafter, Harahan dedicated Moisant Park on Hickory Avenue in his honor. This park was later renamed Zeringue Park shortly after World War II. Wedell-Williams operated commercial and military flights through the 1940s.

In 1930, the Huey P. Long Bridge was opened, increasing the importance of Harahan and by 1940, the population had risen to 1,082 citizens.

During World War II, Camp Plauche was established on the current land occupied by Elmwood. In addition to the camp, Freiburg Mahogany manufacturing began producing critical aircraft and boat components for the war effort. This activity spurred economic growth, particularly new homes; Harahan&#x27;s population tripled during this period. This growth continued after the war.

By 1960, the population had grown to over 9,000. Numerous improvements were undertaken, including modernizing the police and fire departments, paving more streets and building a water treatment facility. Commercial activity was limited to Jefferson Highway and the northern end of Hickory. The 1970s and early 80s so rapid development of apartment construction on Hickory and areas of Elmwood. Completion of Earhart Expressway, making access to New Orleans proper much easier, influenced this growth as the appeal of Harahan as a “bedroom community.” Today, Harahan is directly influenced by its relationship with the larger surrounding areas including Jefferson Parish and the city of New Orleans.

<text>Harvey is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States. Harvey is on the south side (referred to as the &quot;West Bank&quot;) of the Mississippi River, within the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area. The 2020 census determined 22,236 people live in Harvey.

==History==
During the French colonial era, the first owner of this land was Jean-Baptiste d&#x27;Estrehan de Beaupre, royal treasurer and comptroller for the French Louisiana colony. He established a plantation here. He used his slaves to dig the ditch that would become the Harvey Canal, cutting south from the banks of the Mississippi River to the back of Bayou Barataria, to provide better access.

Years later, d&#x27;Estrehan paid German settlers in the area to work on widening the ditch; they used wooden shovels. He paid them with small parcels of land located downriver in Mechanicsham, now the city of Gretna. D&#x27;Estrehan built his home where the ditch met the river banks, naming the settlement &quot;Cosmopolite City&quot;.

Harvey was founded as a company town at its founding, developed by Joseph Hale Harvey (born March 7, 1816). During this time, Joseph Harvey would rename Cosmopolite City after his family surname. Harvey&#x27;s wife, &quot;née&quot; Louise Destrehan, was a great-granddaughter of Jean Baptiste d&#x27;Estrehan. She was the daughter of Nicolas Noel d&#x27;Estrehan and granddaughter of Jean Noel Destréhan.

Harvey and Destrehan initiated construction of the canal locks leading to the Mississippi. Their son, Horace Harvey (c. 1860-1938), carried on development of the canal and its surroundings.

<text>Jean Lafitte ( ) is a town on Bayou Barataria in the U.S. state of Louisiana. Located in Jefferson Parish, it is named after the privateer Jean Lafitte. The population was 1,809 at the 2020 census. It is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Jean Lafitte was originally settled by Native Americans, then explored and settled by the French who established the area as a harbor for large vessels coming in and out of New Orleans. Today, the communities along Bayou Barataria are made up of Jean Lafitte, Lafitte, Crown Point and Barataria.

The town of Jean Lafitte was officially incorporated in 1974, an effort led by Leo E. Kerner Jr., who became the town&#x27;s first mayor. His son, Tim Kerner Sr., later served 7 terms as mayor from 1992 to 2020. In 2020, his son Tim Kerner, Jr. was elected as mayor.

Under the leadership of Timothy Kerner Sr., the town built a number of civic and infrastructure improvements, including: a visitor center, museum, 1,300-seat auditorium, library, civic center, baseball park, senior center, medical clinic, art gallery, and nature trail. One of the mayor&#x27;s major accomplishments was the creation of the Lafitte Area Independent Levee District that eventually secured over $300 million in funds to build tidal protection levees and flood walls.

In 2012, a historical marker for the community of Manila Village was placed in Jean Lafitte. Since mid-2013, Manila Plaza, located in front of Jean Lafitte Town Hall, has held several historical markers and commemorative plaques acknowledging important individuals in the area&#x27;s Filipino American history. The Philippine-Louisiana Historical Society participated in the dedication ceremony.

While there were several settlements of Filipinos (sometimes called &quot;Manilamen&quot; or &quot;Tagalas&quot;) along the Louisiana coast in the late 19th century, Manila Village was the largest. The residents there implemented a system of platforms on which they dried shrimp, as forerunners of Louisiana&#x27;s 21st-century dried shrimp industry. This community-on-stilts thrived for nearly a century, until it was destroyed by Hurricane Betsy in 1965.

In 2014, the town of Jean Lafitte unveiled a historical marker sponsored by the Jefferson Parish Historical Commission at the town&#x27;s visitor center. The historical marker reads: “Named for legendary privateer Jean Lafitte, who helped the United States win the Battle of New Orleans and used area bayous for his smuggling operations. Home to a thriving seafood industry. Incorporated in 1974 as a village. Became a town in 1977. First mayor of village and town was Leo E. Kerner, Jr., 1974-1991.”

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (4.47%) is water.

==Demographics==

According to the 2020 United States census, there were 1,809 people, 604 households, and 446 families residing in the town. At the 2019 American Community Survey, the racial and ethnic makeup of Jean Lafitte was 95.4% non-Hispanic white, 0.1% Black or African American, 0.7% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.5% some other race, and 3.4% two or more races. By 2020, its composition was 82.42% non-Hispanic white, 1.11% Black or African American, 2.32% Native American, 1.22% Asian, 7.85% other races and ethnicities, and 5.09% Hispanic and Latino American, representing the demographic increase of Asians and Latinos nationwide. The median age of the town in 2019 was 39.7 and the median household income was $55,671 with a poverty rate of 17.1%. Of the 656 housing units in the township, males had a median income of $54,400 versus $39,830 for females.

==Government==
The United States Postal Service operates a post office in Jean Lafitte.

==Education==
Lafitte residents are zoned to Jefferson Parish Public Schools.

Residents from K-6 are zoned to Leo E. Kerner Elementary School (formerly Lafitte Elementary School). 7-12 are zoned to Fisher Middle-High School.

The Leo. E. Kerner Jr. City Park Multi-Purpose Complex is located in Jean Lafitte. Jefferson Parish Library operates the Lafitte Library inside the complex. The over facility, which is almost three times larger than the previous library facility, opened on March 4, 2010. The previous library facility sustained damage during Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, and the library contents were destroyed. The American Library Association donated $200,000 to the State of Louisiana, and the Louisiana Library Association&#x27;s Disaster Relief Program awarded $20,000 of that to Jefferson Parish Library; the funds were used to rebuild the Lafitte Library. The previous library building became the Sheriff Harry Lee Police Station.

<text>Jefferson is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States, on the north side (referred to as the &quot;East Bank&quot;) of the Mississippi River. Jefferson is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area. The population was 11,193 at the 2010 census, and 10,533 in 2020. It is often known by locals as &quot;Old Jefferson&quot; (to distinguish itself from the rest of Jefferson Parish), but should not be confused with Old Jefferson in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana.

==History==
Early French colonial documents show what would become Jefferson as part of the &quot;Tchoupitoulas Coast&quot; of Native American settlement. In the French and Spanish colonial era it was divided into a series of plantations with boundary lines perpendicular to the Mississippi River.

In the American Civil War, Camp Parapet was built originally by Confederate forces to defend New Orleans from an attack from the upriver side. After the Union liberated the city sailing up from downriver, U.S. troops expanded the fortifications to defend against Confederate counterattacks which never came.

What is now Jefferson includes formerly separate small communities dating back to the 19th century, including, Hoeyville, New Carrollon, Southport, and Shrewsbury, along with 20th century subdivisions/land developments including Azalea Gardens, Camellia Gardens, Jefferson Heights, and Rio Vista. Some of these names continue to sometimes be used locally to refer to neighborhoods.

The current four-lane Jefferson Highway was inaugurated in 1928, accelerating development as a suburban area within Greater New Orleans.

Former landmarks included what is best remembered as &quot;The Beverly&quot;. An old plantation house was first converted to a &quot;road house&quot; music venue called &quot;Suburban Gardens&quot; in the 1920s; Louis Armstrong and his band had a summer residency here in 1931. In 1945 it was expanded into a lush (but illegal) gambling casino under the name the Beverly Country Club. After federal crackdowns, it became a dinner theater until it burned down in 1983.

Kenner&#x27;s growth began in the late 1950s when developers began subdividing, draining and filling the swampland in the northern half of the city.

<doc id="115622" wikidata="Q1902531" url="?curid=115622" title="Marrero, Louisiana">
<text>Marrero is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States. Marrero is on the south side (referred to as the &quot;West Bank&quot;) of the Mississippi River, within the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner metropolitan statistical area. The population was 32,382 at the 2020 U.S. census.

== History ==
Marrero was named in honor of the Louisiana politician and founder of Marrero Land Company, Louis H. Marrero. The area was originally referred to and shown on maps as &quot;Amesville&quot;, after the Boston businessman Oakes Ames, who purchased much of the land following the Civil War. In February 1916, the U.S. Postmaster officially changed the name of the Post Office to &quot;Marrero&quot;.

Louis Herman Marrero was born in Adams County, Mississippi, on July 17, 1847. When he was a child his family moved to St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. During his school years at Jackson, Louisiana, the Civil War began, and Marrero joined Captain Scott&#x27;s Command, later known as the 25th Louisiana Regiment.

==Geography==

Marrero is located west of the Intracoastal Canal on the Mississippi River, at coordinates (29.886017, -90.109930). It is bordered to the east by Harvey, to the west by Westwego, and to the north, across the Mississippi, by New Orleans.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Marrero CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 7.66%, are water.

==Demographics==
The 2019 American Community Survey estimated 30,894 people lived in the CDP, down from 33,141 at the 2010 U.S. census. In 2020, the population was 32,382. At the 2019 census estimates, the racial and ethnic makeup was 50.1% Black or African American, 37.2% non-Hispanic white, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native, 5.2% Asian, 0.2% some other race, 2.0% multiracial, and 4.9% Hispanic and Latino American of any race. Per the following census in 2020, the composition was 50.12% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 31.9% non-Hispanic white, 0.49% non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native, 5.48% non-Hispanic Asian, 0.01% non-Hispanic Pacific Islander, 3.42% non-Hispanic two or more races, and 8.57% Hispanic or Latino American of any race; this reflects the greater diversification of the United States at the time of this census, becoming less predominantly non-Hispanic white. In 2019, the median household income was $44,866 and 21% of the population lived at or below the poverty line.

<text>Metairie ( ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States, and is part of the New Orleans metropolitan area. With a population of 143,507 in 2020, Metairie is the largest community in Jefferson Parish and was (as of 2010) the fifth-largest CDP in the United States. It is an unincorporated area that (as of 2020) would have been Louisiana&#x27;s fourth-largest city behind Shreveport if incorporated.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Métairie&quot; () is the French term for a small tenant farm which paid the landlord with a share of the produce, a practice also known as sharecropping (in French, &quot;métayage&quot;). In the 1760s many of the original French farmers were tenants; after the Civil War, the majority of the community&#x27;s inhabitants were sharecroppers until urbanization started in the 1910s.

== History ==
In the 1720s French settlers became the first Europeans to settle Metairie in the area known then as Tchoupitoulas and now as Metairie Ridge, a natural levee formed by an ancient branch of the Mississippi River, Bayou Metairie, which flowed through modern-day River Ridge, Metairie, Gentilly, and New Orleans East. It emptied into Mississippi Sound. The Acolapissa Native Americans used this ridge as a road; it is the oldest road in the New Orleans area. Paved in the 1920s, it is called Metairie Road. An electric streetcar was installed running along Metairie Road in the late 1910s, opening the area to greater development. Upscale housing tracts were constructed off the road in the 1920s; this area is now known as &quot;Old Metairie&quot;. The areas to the north and northwest of Metairie Road were not developed until after World War II. The land between Metairie Ridge and Lake Pontchartrain, which was cypress swamps and marshlands, was drained with the Wood Pump. With development of this new land for residences, Metairie&#x27;s population grew in the 1940s as a result of cheaper land, lower taxes, and larger lots as compared to Orleans Parish.

The 1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane, with winds of , directly hit Metairie. Much of the community was under of water.

Hurricane Betsy, a Category Three storm, hit the area in 1965, causing extensive wind damage and moderate flooding. In 1995 the May 8th 1995 Louisiana flood, which dumped upwards of of rain into Metairie in a twelve-hour period, also flooded some parts of the region, especially areas south and west of Metairie, including Kenner, Harahan, and River Ridge.

In 1989, a Metairie district elected white supremacist David Duke to the Louisiana state legislature for a single term.

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused a new migration from Orleans Parish, because housing was needed to replace what had been destroyed in the flooding of the city. It has been a racially neutral migration, with equal numbers of black and white residents moving to Jefferson Parish. The 2010 census showed that Metairie has increasingly become more diverse.

Veterans Boulevard was laid out alongside a drainage canal, and became a commercial center of the region. The central business district of Metairie is located on Causeway Boulevard near Lake Pontchartrain. Metairie also has one of the handful of major malls located in the New Orleans metro area. Lakeside Shopping Center is the highest-grossing mall in the New Orleans metropolitan area. In the 1970s and early 1980s, an area of bars and nightclubs opened in a section of Metairie known as &quot;Fat City&quot;, which is now the most racially diverse area in the New Orleans metropolitan area and is home to a vibrant restaurant scene. Several New Orleans radio and television stations have transmitter facilities in Metairie and Jefferson Parish; two of them, WGNO-TV and WNOL, now have studios and main offices in Metairie. Metairie has a large Mardi Gras season that touts itself as more family-friendly than the New Orleans Mardi Gras.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===

The most common method of transportation within Metairie is the automobile. Mass transit is provided by &quot;JeT&quot; (Jefferson Transit), but it does not run on Sundays, holidays, or late at night, unlike many lines of New Orleans&#x27; RTA. JeT&#x27;s coverage is also very limited in terms of usability.

Interstate 10 runs east–west through Metairie.

Major east–west roads (starting from north to south) include West Esplanade Avenue, Veterans Memorial Boulevard, West Napoleon Avenue, West Metairie Avenue, Metairie Road, Airline Drive (which is part of U.S. Route 61) and Jefferson Highway (which is part of U.S. Route 90). The Earhart Expressway, running east–west immediately south of Airline Drive, is the only other freeway entering New Orleans from the west, but it ends as an expressway soon after crossing into Orleans Parish and well before the New Orleans CBD (in Central City.)

For many of the major east–west roadways, the eastbound and westbound lanes are separated by large, open-topped drainage canals. These canals are one of the most distinct characteristics of the Metairie landscape. Similar canals once bisected many streets in neighboring New Orleans, but most were covered over in the mid-20th century.

Multi-line, continuous north–south roads (starting from west to east) include Power Boulevard/David Drive/Hickory Avenue, Transcontinental Drive, Clearview Parkway, Causeway Boulevard, and Bonnabel Boulevard.

The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway&#x27;s southern terminus lies in Metairie.

<text>River Ridge is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is a suburb of New Orleans. The population was 13,591 in 2020.

== History ==
The land that is now River Ridge was developed by French colonists and their descendants in the late 18th and early 19th centuries for large sugar plantations; these lined the Mississippi River in traditional French long-lot fashion. The plantations had relatively narrow waterfronts, in order to provide water access, and extended deeply back from the river. These plantations were developed by French colonists and their descendants; they depended on the labor of African slaves. Major landowners included members of the Trudeau and Sauve families. (Pierre Sauve (1805–1867) had a major plantation here known as Providence.)

The alignments of the major streets in the area are vestiges of this era. Sauve Road continues to be a main thoroughfare in River Ridge.

In 1849, a major flooding event known as Sauvé&#x27;s Crevasse occurred. The crude river levee at the Sauve Providence plantation failed under pressure of high water on the Mississippi. The massive flood inundated much of the land to the east, including parts of New Orleans. This crevasse occurred where a former meander of the Mississippi River once branched to form the Metairie and Gentilly Ridges.

In the early 20th century, an interurban transit line was constructed through this area. It served to connect the cities of New Orleans and Kenner. It was aligned along the present course of Jefferson Highway, which was improved from earlier roads.

For many years the area remained rural farmland, until the post-World War II suburbanization era. Aided by funding under the G.I. Bill, which enabled veterans to buy houses, large-scale suburban development began in the early 1950s. By 1965, virtually all of the area along the Mississippi River between Harahan and Kenner was developed. This area at the time was known as &quot;Little Farms&quot;, a name which well described its pre-urban history; this was also the place name officially recognized by the Post Office. (To this day Little Farms Avenue remains a major River Ridge thoroughfare.) Other subdivision names such as &quot;East Bank&quot; and &quot;Rural Acres&quot; were used as place names for the area at the time.

To eliminate confusion and create some sense of community identity, the area between Kenner, Harahan, Metairie, and the Mississippi River was officially renamed &quot;River Ridge&quot; in 1974.

In 2019, a baseball team from River Ridge won the Little League World Series, becoming the first team from Louisiana to do so. They also became the first team since 2001 to lose their opening game, but win the championship.

<text>Westwego is a city in the U.S. state of Louisiana, located in Jefferson Parish. It is a suburban community of New Orleans in the Greater New Orleans metropolitan area and lies along the west bank of the Mississippi River. The population of the city of Westwego was 8,568 at the 2020 United States census.

==Etymology==
One story states that Westwego was so named because it was a major crossing point on the Mississippi River during the great westward movement of the late 19th century. When travelers were asked their destination, they would often reply &quot;west we go&quot;. Another more specific tale, recounted in John Churchill Chase&#x27;s &quot;Frenchmen, Desire, Good Children&quot; is that the name was the specific outcome of an 1871 meeting of a railroad board of directors in New York, where planning was undertaken to use the site as an eastern terminus (&quot;...west we go from there&quot;). There has been further speculation that this use of &quot;Westwego&quot; as a place name may have been influenced by the board members&#x27; familiarity with the name of Oswego, New York.

==History==

=== Early history and development ===
The area of Westwego, Louisiana was inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years before Europeans settled here. These indigenous people created huge shell middens that can still be seen in the vicinity today. The French first developed the area in 1719 when French minister of state Claude le Blanc started a plantation and a port along the Mississippi River.

The port became an important site in the history of the transatlantic slave trade. The estate was later owned by the Zeringue family, who turned it into bustling sugar plantation, known as Seven Oaks. Planter Camille Zeringue built a canal at the plantation that played a prominent role in the community&#x27;s history for decades. Other antebellum plantations in the area included the Whitehouse Plantation, Magnolia Lane, and the LaBranche Plantation among others. After Camille Zeringue&#x27;s death, Seven Oaks was owned by Pablo Sala, who divided the property along the canal into lots, which he sold for $40 each. Many of these lots were purchased by displaced hurricane victims from Cheniere Caminada whose homes were destroyed in the great unnamed 1893 storm. With the addition of these families, who were mostly fisherman and trappers, the community of Salaville was born.

Salaville grew and the local railroad barons coined the name &quot;Westwego&quot;. A number of industries grew around the city&#x27;s wetlands and bayous, including those involving fisheries, shrimping, the canning of seafood, etc. Westwego was incorporated as a city in 1951 as its population continued to grow and grow. Within the last decade, Westwego has taken on a number of historical restoration projects, inspired by historian Daniel P. Alario Sr.

=== Grain elevator explosion ===
On December 23, 1977, the Continental Grain Elevator in Westwego exploded. The explosion and resulting collapse of the elevator killed 36 people and injured at least 11 others. Most of the fatalities were caused by a concrete tower collapsing onto an office building, where workers were gathered for a Christmas party. The explosion is believed to have been caused by the ignition of grain dust. The blast caused silos to fall and lean against each over in essentially a domino effect. The accident is the deadliest grain elevator accident in history. The Westwego accident, along with other explosions that occurred within the two-year period, led to new regulations for preventing dust explosions.

<text>Jena () is a town in, and the parish seat of, La Salle Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 4,155 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The site where Jena stands today began to attract settlers in 1802. The Hemphills family entered a considerable block of land and settled about two miles below the present town of Jena. Hemps Creek and post office were named after this family. This beautiful ever-running creek had fertile bottom and hammock lands for cultivation and was an excellent range for both cattle and hogs, with wild game and fish being very abundant.

Later, in the middle 1850s, Benjamin Baker, assisted by his father, a native of Pennsylvania, built a watermill on Hemps Creek, about three miles below the present town of Jena. The mill was equipped to make corn meal and to gin cotton. This area soon became a favorite trading stop for the area farmers, and was the site of two general stores and a post office.

Hemps Creek post office was established in the late 1850s with Isaac L. Baker as the first postmaster. The mail rider boarded with Mr. Baker and made alternate weekly trips to Harrisonburg and Alexandria on horseback. In 1869, the first school house was built, and in 1892, the Jena Seminary opened, marking the beginning of secondary education in what is now LaSalle Parish. Mr. James Forsythe who came to Hemps Creek in 1861 having subsequently served with distinction in the Confederate Army returned in 1865 and established his home here. Being an educated man and having fine qualities of leadership, he was chosen as teacher of Hemps Creek School, a position he held until 1871.

In the year of 1871, it was requested from the post office department that “Creek” and “Bayou” be removed from the names of all post offices. Mr. Andrew Forsythe visiting his brother, James Forsythe from Jena, Illinois suggested Jena, his hometown, which was named for Jena, Germany. Mr. James Forsythe submitted this name to the post office department and it was accepted. Thus, the name Jena came from Germany by way of Illinois.

The Louisiana &amp; Arkansas Railroad operated its first train into Jena on December 31, 1893, and on May 1, 1904, the first passenger train arrived. A small hotel was operated nearby, and in 1905, the “Jena Times” newspaper was founded.

On October 2, 1918, Mrs. Lula V. Coleman was made a Deputy Sheriff. It was her opinion that she was the first female sheriff in the United States. On March 28, 1920, she was appointed to head the town administration as mayor, by Governor John M. Parker.  Mrs. Coleman has the distinction of being the only woman ever to serve as mayor of Jena, and was the first female to hold the office of mayor in Louisiana and possibly even the United States.

In September 2006, Jena became the focus of national news stories in the United States for a racial controversy involving its school system and a group of students known as the Jena Six.

==History==

The Town of Olla is the oldest incorporated town in LaSalle Parish. Settled prior to the American Civil War, the town of Olla was known as Castor Sulfur Springs, and a steamboat port on nearby Bayou Castor was its original site. The area had a post office, general store, hotel, spa, and a dry goods and cotton storage facility.

Naturally-occurring sulfur muds and spring water made Castor Sulfur Springs a nationally known &quot;health spa&quot;.

In 1890, the Olla Military Institute, a private military school was established. The first faculty members consisted of Riley J. Wilson, Ms. Olla Mills, John Paul Jones, Missy Robertson, Rev. Elijah Bryant, and Bell Murphy. The school flourished for several years until 1899, when a fire destroyed the campus. At this time, a public school, Olla High School, was constructed to serve the towns of Olla and Standard. In 1950, Olla, Urania, and Tullos High Schools closed, and consolidated as LaSalle High School. The Olla Elementary School now sits at the former site of the Olla Military Institute and Olla High School.

In 1891, the Houston, Central Arkansas, and Northern Railroad came to what was then northwest Catahoula Parish and bought a 200-foot-wide right-of-way over which it would construct a railroad more than a mile away from Castor Sulfur Springs. Community leaders were faced with the possibility that their town would be cut off and decided that a railroad station must be constructed for passenger and commercial services to ensure the survival of Castor Sulfur Springs. Dr. Frank Mills, with the assistance of Mr. J.D. Adams, set aside 40 acres of land for a station and town-site. This transaction was recorded on February 9, 1891. When the new site was chosen and incorporation paperwork was submitted naming the new community “New Castor Sulfur Springs”, their request was denied.

The legislature was not accepting new municipalities named in reference to springs, rivers, bayous, or creeks to avoid duplication and confusion. New Lebanon was considered as well as many Greek and Biblical names, which were very popular at the time. After much debate, it was decided that the relocated community should be named for Olla Mills, daughter of Dr. Frank Mills and sister of Judge W.H. Mills, who were residents of Castor Sulfur Springs for many years. Ms. Mills was an accomplished, attractive, and popular young lady who was dramatically inclined and took part in all constructive community activities, who served with distinction as the head of the Olla Military Institute&#x27;s English department. Miss Olla Mills, who later became Mrs. CC Young, died in 1901 and is buried in the Olla Cemetery.

The Town of Olla was officially incorporated on August 1, 1899, with Dr. William V. Taylor III as its first mayor. In 1906, the Zeagler Family established and erected the Olla State Bank as the cornerstone of the downtown. Built in Romanesque Revival style, the bank&#x27;s structure is said to be influenced by Louisiana native and architect Henry Hobson Richardson. The Olla State Bank served Olla and the surrounding region throughout the Great Depression until its merger with Southern Heritage Bank in 1980s. The Ernest Gray Gang as well as The Jimmy Yarrell Gang held up the bank in the 1930s.

Olla is also the location of the only train holdup in Louisiana history. In August 1900, unknown bandits built a fire on the tracks north of Olla and forced the train to stop. The group then boarded and ordered the conductor to disconnect the mail and express cars from the train. The express safe was cracked, but the expected big money shipment from St. Louis, Missouri to New Orleans was not aboard. The robbers got away with less than $50.

Near the site of the former Olla Military Institute, B.E. Zeagler of Olla and L.C. Nunn of Columbia, Louisiana organized and constructed the North Central Louisiana Fair or Carnival fair barns, and an equine racetrack stadium in 1912. Since its inception, the open space has served the parishes of La Salle, Winn, Grant, and Caldwell, and it is now called the Olla Fairgrounds. Still host to an annual event every fall, it is one of the oldest continuously running fairs or carnivals in the United States. The fairgrounds also contains a modern rodeo arena that hosts the Olla Rodeo, sponsored by the local Kiwanis International club, annually.

In 1910, the state of Louisiana split Catahoula Parish in half. The western half where the Town of Olla is situated became La Salle Parish, named for French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. An immediate struggle developed between the towns of Olla and Jena over the location of the parish courthouse. Jena was subsequently chosen as the La Salle parish seat because of its central location. Even without the prestige of being the parish seat, the early 20th century brought many changes to the Town of Olla. Olla&#x27;s economy grew with the success of two large sawmills in the area – Urania Lumber Company to the south and Louisiana Central Lumber Company located to the north, in Standard. Mr. G.W. McCartney purchased a dynamo to bring electric lights to Olla. Residences were also piped with natural gas. The town took another step forward when Mr. Sam Shamblin opened a silent movie house. The Community Talking Picture Company of Shreveport sold Olla its first talking movies, and later a more modern theater was erected.

Known for its excellent ground water, Olla was the site of the Olla Bottling Works. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Olla Bottling Works made and distributed numerous flavored carbonated beverages including NuGrape Soda. The Olla Bottling Works was purchased by a firm in Monroe and eventually merged with the Coca-Cola Bottling Company.

The Southern Baptist encampment and the Civilian Conservation Corps Camp activities also left their mark on Olla. Each year Baptist campers gathered for two weeks of religious instruction, preaching, and recreation. The CCC Camp occupied the same facilities the remainder of the year, and the area is still crossed with public and private roads built by the CCC. Olla is also the site of Camp Olla, an annual Pentecostal summer camp, retreat, and hurricane evacuation shelter.

In 1938, oil was discovered just outside Olla&#x27;s boundaries. This was a tremendous boost for the local economy because the large sawmills had begun to slow production. The Olla Oil Field brought a fresh influx of people and is large producer of light sweet crude and natural gas.

The Town of Olla currently serves as a regional hub for banking, commercial retail, and manufacturing and is heavily involved with the forestry and petroleum production industries.

Downtown Olla is a recognized Historic District with many buildings being restored for commercial use.

On November 23, 2004, a tornado that reached F3 strength tore through parts of the town, destroying or damaging a large portion of the buildings, including LaSalle High School. Classes were held in an abandoned sportswear factory, known as Holloway Sportswear, until a new high school was constructed. In 2005, the town played host to many evacuees from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

<doc id="115634" wikidata="Q729559" url="?curid=115634" title="Carencro, Louisiana">
<text>Carencro (; historically ) is a city in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is a suburb of the nearby city of Lafayette. The population was 7,526 at the 2010 census, up from 6,120 in 2000; at the 2020 census, its population was 9,272. The name of the city is derived from the Cajun French word for buzzard; the spot where the community was settled was one where large flocks of American black vultures roosted in the bald cypress trees. The name means &quot;carrion crow.&quot; Carencro is part of the Lafayette metropolitan area.

==Etymology==
Many senior Carencro natives attest that the town&#x27;s name originates from before the American Civil War. According to this local legend, Native Americans told Vermilionville settlers that in old times a large number of &quot;carrion crows&quot; (vultures, called &quot;carencro&quot; in French) had settled around the Vermilion River between Lafayette and Opelousas, Louisiana to feast on a fish die-off.

There is a related theory, consistent with the spelling, that the place is named for the &quot;carencro tête rouge&quot;, a red-headed buzzard referred to by European explorers as early as 1699, and described in 1774 by Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz. Du Pratz described the bird as having black plumage and a head covered with red flesh. He said the Spanish government protected the birds, &quot;for as they do not use the whole carcass of the buffaloes which (the Spaniards) kill, those birds eat what they leave, which otherwise, by rotting on the ground, would ... infect the air.&quot; 

In a letter written on April 23, 1802, Martin Duralde, a former commandant of the Opelousas post, related the legend as it had come down from an Attakapas Indian. Duralde wrote: &quot;Many years before the discovery of the elephant in the bayou called an Attakapas savage had informed a man who is at present in my service in the capacity of cow-herd that the ancestors of his nation transmitted (the story) to their descendants that a beast of enormous size had perished either in this bayou or in one of the two water courses a short distance from it without their being able to indicate the true place, the antiquity of the event having without doubt made them forget it.&quot; (Note: The mastodon became extinct 4500–10,000 years ago)

A late 19th-century account stated the legend came from buzzards (vultures) feasting on a mastodon carcass. Its fossilized bones were reportedly discovered and collected by a French naturalist in the 18th century and shipped to the Jardin des Plantes of Paris, but the ship was wrecked on the way, and the bones were lost at sea. The only relic of the mastodon was a femur or leg bone, which was kept by an early settler, the first Guilbeau. He used it as a pestle to bruise indigo for processing, a crop then cultivated in the Attakapas Indian country. The Indians termed the birds &quot;carecros&quot;; and from the spot where the mastodon died, the river takes the name of Bayou Carencro.

First called St. Pierre, in the late 19th century, the town was renamed Carencro, after the &quot;carrion crow&quot; (vulture) legend. Although Carencro&#x27;s current town center lies well west of the Vermilion River, this legend has permanence within the community.

Some people think that the name comes from the Spanish &quot;carnero&quot;, meaning &quot;bone pile.&quot; This idea also comes from the mastodon legend, and the idea that the buzzards left nothing but a pile of white bones after they had picked the mastodon clean.

==History==

===Early settlement===
Few European people settled in the Carencro area (around Lafayette) until the coming of the Acadian refugees in the 18th century. Some of the Acadians transported in 1765 to the Attakapas district were given lands along Bayou Carencro, although probably not in what is now the town of Carencro. At that time, Jean and Marin Mouton, Charles Peck, Louis Pierre Arceneaux and others began to establish &quot;vacheries&quot; in the vicinity. More cattlemen would follow after 1770, when Spanish Gov. Alejandro O&#x27;Reilly decreed that &quot;a grant of 42 arpents [] in front by 42 in depth could be issued only to those who owned 100 head of tame cattle, some sheep and horses, and two slaves to oversee them.&quot;

In 1769, Juan Kelly and Eduardo Nugent toured the area for the government and reported to O&#x27;Reilly that &quot;the inhabitants maintain everything imaginable in the way of livestock, such as cows, horses and sheep.&quot; A Frenchman named Lyonnet, visiting in 1793, found thousands of cattle on the Attakapas and Opelousas prairies.

Jean and Marin Mouton were among the early settlers on Bayou Carencro. Other early settlers in the Carencro area were Charles Peck, Traveille Bernard, Rosamond Breaux, Ovignar Arceneaux, and the Babineaux family. An 1803 census of the Carencro area listed family names including Arceneaux, Babineaux, Benoit, Bernard, Breaux, Carmouche, Caruthers, Comeaux, Cormier, Guilbeaux, Hébert, Holway, LeBlanc, Melançon, Mire, Mouton, Pierre, Prejean, Roger, St. Julien, Savoie, and Thibodeaux.

===First post office===
The first post office in Carencro was established on January 11, 1872, with Auguste Melchior as postmaster. The telegraph line reached there in 1884. The first telephones were installed by the Teche and Vermilion Telephone Line in 1894. The company was headquartered in New Iberia.

===Historic churches===

According to Roger Baudier&#x27;s history of the Catholic Church of Louisiana, the Carencro area was first served from Grand Coteau, Louisiana, later from Vermilionville, and then from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana. 

The parish of St. Peter was established in 1874 and the archdiocese sent Father Andre Marie Guillot as its first pastor. Before a church was built at Carencro, services were held in the Carmouche blacksmith shop. The church was initially called &quot;St. Pierre au Carencro&quot;, named for Pierre Cormier, who donated land for the first church. Father Guillot died of yellow fever while serving in Carencro. He was buried in the church cemetery.

According to Baudier, &quot;(Father Guillot&#x27;s) successor was Father J.F Suriray. Trouble with the parishioners arose and Father Suriray was threatened by the people. Some three years after his coming to Carencro, he was obliged to leave. Some time after, the church was destroyed by fire and the parish remained without a pastor until 1883.&quot;

A plaque outside the later church notes the land was donated by the Jean Jacques Coussan family. A new church was built in 1893, but was destroyed by a tornado before it was ever used. Another church was built, and it burned in 1904. The current church was built in 1906 under the administration of Father F.J. Grimeaux, who served the parish for some 25 years. In addition, he organized the Carencro Brass Band and played clarinet with it. 

A young carpenter named Hector Connolly worked for $2.50 a day to build the 110-foot steeple. 

The Church of the Assumption was built in 1925 to serve a Black congregation. The Holy Ghost Fathers accepted an invitation to direct the parish and sent Father Joseph Dolan as the first pastor. Assumption Church continues to operate today with its original structure. This is the only white, wood-frame structure of its kind in the Diocese of Lafayette.

Our Lady of the Assumption Religious Complex consists of the church, rectory, school, Drexel Parish Hall (former Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament Convent), the church cemetery, and St. Katharine Drexel Shrine. The complex was listed on the State and National Register of Historic Places in November 2001.

===Historic schools===
In 1870 Auguste Melchior, a Frenchman from New Orleans, was appointed as director of the Lafayette Parish educational system. In 1874, what was probably the first school in Carencro, was opened on his farm in town. His wife, Viviana Carencro, taught at the village school.

In 1889, Carencro had two private schools. Charles Heichelheim, a German, ran a school for boys, and Edmond Villére operated one for both boys and girls. That year, the first public school was built in Carencro. A second story was added to it 10 years later. The school became an approved high school about 1917.

About the turn of the century, Father J.B. Laforet sold three lots to Mother St. Patrick of the Sisters of Mount Carmel. They opened St. Ann&#x27;s School of Carencro, in 1897.

Assumption School was built in 1932 and was staffed by the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament. It brought together Black students from several smaller Catholic schools in the area. The school was operated with funding from Saint Katharine Drexel of New Orleans. 

After the 1950s, the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament taught at Carencro Catholic School, located at the west end of Church Street. In the early 1980s, the students of Assumption School were combined with those of St. Pierre School to form Carencro Catholic.

===Economic prosperity===
&quot;The Opelousas Courier&quot; reported on the young settlement at least twice during the year 1879. The April 19 edition stated, &quot;&quot;This little village is rapidly expanding. ... The grounds of the church have been planted in trees and enclosed with a fence of a new kind. This enclosure is of iron wire and armed with steel barbs, forming a barrier inaccessible to animals.&quot; &quot;

On September 6, the newspaper gave this account: &quot;&quot;The little village of St. Pierre, at Carencro, born only a short time ago, tends to stretch itself in an astonishing fashion with numbers of buildings where all kinds of trades and professions are prospering there. Many beautiful stores, well assorted with that which meets the needs of the inhabitants, are established there since a short time ago and we note, among others, the fine establishment of Mr. Ignace Bernard near the church.&quot; &quot;

By 1889, Carencro had two sugar factories, one operated by J.C. Couvillon, and another run by I. Singleton. In 1894, Victor E. Dupuis, one of the larger cane growers of the area, formed the Carencro Sugar Company to build another sugar mill alongside Morgan&#x27;s Railroad. The sugar mills in the area closed about 1900.

There were several horse-powered cotton gins in Carencro before 1876. In that year, Avignac Arceneaux built the first steam-powered gin in the parish. Four more gins were built there in the late 1880s and in the 1890s. In 1889, 1,800 bales of cotton were shipped from the Carencro Station. Cotton gins continued to operate in Carencro until the middle 1970s, when the last two, Cotton Products Co. and Farmer&#x27;s Gin Co., were closed.

====Merchants and plantation owners====
In 1891, historian William Henry Perrin suggested that &quot;there is no prettier site for a town (than Carencro) nor one with more solid advantages than comprised in this place. &quot;

Among leading merchants in the 1890s were the Brown Brothers, Jacob Mitchell, D. Daret, A.G. Guilbeau, G. Schmuler, C. Micou, and J.C. Martin. 

People owning large plantations near the town were Mrs. Z. Broussard, Dr. R.J. Francez, Mrs. O.C. Mouton, Louis Roger, Mrs. F. Abadie, C.C. Brown, St. Clair Kilchrist, V.C. Dupuis. and L.J. Arceneaux. Entrepreneur Charles J. Richard opened the town&#x27;s lumberyard along the Southern Pacific Railroad. Nearly 100 years later, the enterprise closed during a regional economic recession in 1985.

===Modern===

Carencro&#x27;s St. Peter&#x27;s Catholic Church and cemetery form an artistic centerpiece of the town. St. Peter&#x27;s Catholic Church has an ornate cypress-carved entrance, altar and narthex, as well as intricate pew end caps. These unique end caps were designed by Catholic Frs. Wassler and Edwards (now both deceased). In one period, the pews were &#x27;sold&#x27; to parishioners for their use at worship to raise money for the church. 

Carencro notables such as former postmaster William J. Broussard and former lumberyard owner Oliver Richard are buried in this cemetery. Carencro&#x27;s cemetery is above ground, unlike low-lying areas to the east in the Atchafalaya Basin and areas south of Baton Rouge. These eschew the ground-level graves of Lafayette (as well as points west and north) for mausoleums because of the high water table.

The City Hall and Fire Station complex, designed by local architect Lynn Guidry, is a modern counterpoint to the traditional Catholic church. It can be seen at the southern turn of Church Street east of U.S. 182.

<text>Lafayette ( , ) is the most populous city in and parish seat of Lafayette Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana, located along the Vermilion River. It is Louisiana&#x27;s fourth-most populous city with a 2020 census population of 121,374; the consolidated city-parish&#x27;s population was 241,753 in 2020. The Lafayette metropolitan area was Louisiana&#x27;s third largest metropolitan statistical area with a population of 478,384 at the 2020 census. The Acadiana region containing Lafayette is the largest population and economic corridor between Houston, Texas and New Orleans.

Originally established as Vermilionville in the 1820s and incorporated in 1836, Lafayette developed as an agricultural community until the introduction of retail and entertainment centers, and the discovery of oil in the area in the 1940s. Since the discovery of oil, the city and parish have had the highest number of workers in the oil and natural gas industry in Louisiana as of 2018. With the issuance of a bond ordinance for a series of roads connecting nearby settlements; the establishment of the University of Louisiana System&#x27;s Lafayette campus; and the continued diversification of its economy, Lafayette and its metropolitan area have experienced population growth since the 1840 census and was promptly nicknamed &quot;The Hub City.&quot; The city and parish of Lafayette are also known as the &quot;Heart of Acadiana.&quot;

As a result of its growth, the city and region have become major centers for the technology industry; Lafayette also became a major center for health care and social services, aerospace, banking and retail. Notable corporations with headquarters or a large presence in the Lafayette area have included Amazon, Brookshire Grocery Company, CGI, JP Morgan Chase, Ochsner Health System, Petroleum Helicopters International, and Rouses Markets.

Lafayette is home to a diverse population from Louisiana Creole and Cajun backgrounds. In 2014, Lafayette was named the &quot;Happiest City in America.” The city and region&#x27;s cultural icons include Alexandre Mouton House, Brandt House, Charles H. Mouton House, the Cathedral of Saint John the Evangelist, Daigle House, First United Methodist Church, Holy Rosary Institute, Hope Lodge No. 145, and Old Lafayette City Hall. Its educational institutions include the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, South Louisiana Community College, and Remington College.

==Etymology==
Lafayette is named after Marquis de Lafayette. Little is known about early settlements or if the area had a different name prior to European colonization. The city was originally founded in 1821 as Vermilionville.

==History==
=== Colonization and settlement ===
The Attakapa Native Americans inhabited this area at the time of the first European encounter. French colonists founded the first European settlement, &quot;Petit Manchac&quot;, a trading post along the Vermilion River. In the mid-to-late eighteenth century, numerous Acadian refugees settled in this area, after being expelled from Canada after Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War. They intermarried with other settlers, forming what became known as Cajun culture, which maintained use of the French language and adherence to the Roman Catholic Church.

=== Municipal incorporation ===
Jean Mouton, an Acadian settler, donated land to the Roman Church for construction of a small Catholic chapel at this site. In 1824, this area was selected for the Lafayette Parish seat and was named Vermilionville, for its location on the river; in 1836, the Louisiana State Legislature approved its incorporation.

The area was initially developed by Europeans for agriculture, primarily sugar plantations, which depended on the labor of numerous enslaved Africans and African Americans. They made up a large percentage of the antebellum population. According to U.S. census data in 1830, some 41 percent of the population of Lafayette Parish was enslaved. By 1860, the enslaved population had increased to 49.6 percent. Some free people of color lived in Lafayette Parish, as well; they made up 3 percent to a low of 2.4 percent between 1830 and 1860.

In 1884, Vermilionville was renamed for General Lafayette, a French aristocrat who had fought with and significantly aided the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The city and parish economy continued to be based on agriculture into the early 20th century. After the American Civil War, most of the labor was done by freedmen, who worked as sharecroppers. From the 1930s, mechanization of agriculture began to reduce the need for farm workers.

=== Growth and consolidation ===
By 1898, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette was established in the city as the Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute. It opened in 1901, and changed its name to the University of Southwestern Louisiana in 1960. The university&#x27;s current name was chosen in 1999.

In the 1940s, after oil was discovered in the parish, the petroleum and natural gas industries expanded to dominate the economy. By 2018, Lafayette had the highest number of oil and natural gas industry workers in the state.

Since the latter half of the 20th century, Lafayette has hosted the Festivals Acadiens et Créoles, and was candidate as site for the New Orleans Pelicans NBA G League team in 2017.

In 1996, the city and parish consolidated; the governments of the city and parish were merged, though five other incorporated municipalities continued to operate with their own municipal governments and departments. Since the beginning of the 21st century, a committee proposed the deconsolidation of the city and parish.

In 2015, the city of Lafayette gained international attention for a mass shooting and murder-suicide at Grand 16 Theater; this mass shooting spurred further discussion and debate on gun control in the United States.

==Geography==

The city of Lafayette is located at (30.2139, −92.0294), in southern Louisiana&#x27;s Acadiana region on the Gulf Coast of the United States. It was part of the seabed during the earlier Quaternary period. During this time, the Mississippi River cut a valley between what is now Lafayette and Baton Rouge. This valley was filled and is now the Atchafalaya Basin. The city is located on the western rim of this valley.

The Lafayette area is part of the southwestern Louisiana Prairie Terrace; it is higher and not made of wetlands like much of the surrounding areas to the south and west of Lafayette. Lafayette does not suffer significant flooding problems, outside of local flash flooding. Lafayette has developed on both sides of the Vermilion River. Other significant waterways in the city are Isaac Verot Coulee, Coulee Mine, Coulee des Poches, and Coulee Ile des Cannes, which are natural drainage canals that lead to the Vermilion River.

Near these structures, Chase and Doubletree have been the area&#x27;s tallest buildings at 15 and 16 stories.

With the announcement of the latest addition to the city in over 40 years, two high-rise towers were planned and would stand 4 stories higher. In October 2021, it was announced only one high-rise tower would be constructed citing lack of interest in condominiums within the area; the project was halted in January 2022 citing further difficulties. The attempted construction of new high-rises within the heart of the city followed efforts to redevelop the downtown area in the 2010s and attract further residents. Alongside high-rise construction projects throughout the downtown area, a 70-unit apartment development began in early 2022 spurring continued interest in urban development.

==Demographics==


Attakapa Native Americans were originally the primary residents of the Lafayette area before French colonization, concentrated along the Vermilion River. After the Louisiana Purchase, American settlers began moving into the area and intermarrying among the French, enslaved Africans, and free people of color. Since 1860, Lafayette has grown from 498 to 121,374 residents at the 2020 U.S. census. Following the American Community Survey&#x27;s 5 year estimates program, the city has continued population growth with an additional 2020 estimate at 126,674 residents.

With the migration and population growth of European, African, and multiracial Americans since early settlement, the racial and ethnic makeup of the city has been predominantly non-Hispanic or Latino white, Black or African American, multiracial, and Asian. French, German, English, American, Irish, and Italian were the largest European ancestry groups among the non-Hispanic or Latino white population. Asian settlers arrived during the establishment of Filipino communities along the coast of Louisiana (primarily in the Greater New Orleans area) up to established communities in the Acadiana region as of 2013. The city and area&#x27;s Hispanic and Latino American population have existed since Spanish colonization of Louisiana.

According to 2021 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, its non-Hispanic or Latino white population have been prevalent throughout the city proper&#x27;s geographic foothold with exception to its northern neighborhoods. More than 34% of its Hispanic and Latino American population lived in the central-west portion of the city, and Black and African Americans primarily dominated the northern half of Lafayette city proper. Its Asian American community was dispersed throughout the whole city alongside multiracial Americans, and people of other races and ethnicities primarily lived near downtown or the city&#x27;s border with Carencro.

Having historic growth from the 20th and 21st centuries attributed primarily to the oil and gas industry, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and Acadiana tourism, an estimated 3.8 percent of the city&#x27;s population was foreign-born from 2014 to 2019; of the foreign-born population, 33.6 percent were naturalized U.S. citizens. Altogether English, French, and Spanish were the most spoken languages at home among the native and foreign-born populations. In 2022, the city&#x27;s foreign-born population grew to 5.8%.

=== Sexual orientation and gender identity ===
While in the predominantly conservative southern U.S., Lafayette has maintained a substantial lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community since at least 1969, when some members of the Mystic Krewe of Apollo, a gay cultural, social, and service organization in New Orleans, arrived in the city. The area&#x27;s LGBT population have described Acadiana as &quot;welcoming,&quot; though some members of the community in the 1970s declined to be photographed at public and private LGBT events. While regarded as welcoming, Lafayette&#x27;s government was once under the Human Rights Campaign Foundation&#x27;s focus regarding non-discrimination in city employment; a local government spokesperson responded with reports of no complaints from the local LGBT community. In 2023, the community celebrated the second annual Pride Acadiana.

=== Religion ===

In common with Louisiana&#x27;s religious demographic, Lafayette and its metropolitan area are predominantly religious, dominated by Christianity. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020, the Catholic Church was the single largest Christian denomination with a reported 212,013 adherents, and Protestants were the largest collective Christian group. Among Protestant Christians, the largest were non-denominational Christians with 26,860 adherents; Southern Baptists with 22,324; Progressive National Baptists with 19,324; United Methodists with 8,401; and Assemblies of God USA with 6,704 adherents.

Owing in part to Spanish and French colonialism and missionary work, Christians have historically affiliated with the Latin Church&#x27;s Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette in Louisiana. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette in Louisiana was founded in 1918 and its see is the Cathedral of Saint John the Evangelist. Within the local Protestant traditions, Baptists have been the primary historic Protestant body affiliated with; the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. and Progressive National Baptist Convention have been the city and region&#x27;s historically Black or African American Baptist denominations, though the Church of God in Christ has also been a historically prominent African American Protestant body.

Mormons, Lutherans, and Presbyterians have also maintained minority presences within the Lafayette municipal and metropolitan communities. Christians of other traditions including the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and united and uniting churches have been present in the city&#x27;s metropolitan area since the 20th century. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the oldest nontrinitarian Christian denomination in Lafayette, and has one church in the city limits; the closest LDS churches outside of Lafayette are in New Iberia and Opelousas. There has been one Antiochian Orthodox jurisdiction operating since 2004; there is also a Coptic Orthodox mission under the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States. Altogether, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, and non-mainstream Protestantism have constituted a significant minority in contrast to Catholic and Baptist missionary work.

In a separate religious study by Sperling&#x27;s BestPlaces in 2020, Judaism and Islam were tied as the second largest non-Christian religions within Lafayette and its metropolitan area. Jews began immigrating to the area in the 1800s, and one of Louisiana&#x27;s oldest continuously operated synagogues (Temple Shalom) has been present in the city since 1869. The historic synagogue of Temple Shalom originally functioned as an Orthodox Jewish congregation before joining the Reform Judaism movement. Lafayette&#x27;s Jewish community has assisted in economic and cultural development of the area since their arrival.

==Government==
Lafayette has a consolidated city–parish government, known as the Lafayette Consolidated Government; parish voters agreed to consolidation of the city and parish governments in 1996. Lafayette&#x27;s chief executive was initially called the city-parish president, but is now known as the mayor-president for the Lafayette Consolidated Government. Republican Monique Blanco-Boulet was elected to this office most recently.

The consolidation of the city and parish has been the subject of continuous public debate over the years. In 2011, a charter commission recommended deconsolidation, though parish voters rejected the recommendation. In 2018, voters separated the single city–parish council into a city council to represent the city of Lafayette and a parish council to represent Lafayette Parish. The mayor-president is still elected parishwide. In 2021, the city council passed a resolution calling for another charter commission to look at amendments to the charter and, if necessary, deconsolidation. The Lafayette Parish Council did not agree to the charter commission proposal. Public works and other services, such as land use and plat review, are operated by the Lafayette Consolidated Government to serve the city of Lafayette and unincorporated areas of Lafayette Parish, and by contract some of the area municipalities. Zoning rules apply only within the city and unincorporated areas of Lafayette Parish.

Some neighboring municipalities have adopted their own planning and zoning protocols. The suburban and rural cities and towns maintain independent city councils, local executives, police and fire departments, and other public services. The LPSS operates independently of any municipality, and its jurisdiction is coterminous with Lafayette Parish.

Lafayette is home to a regional office of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, and the headquarters of the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana, the state agency that oversees preservation and documentation of Louisiana French for tourism, economic development, culture, education, and the development of international relations with other Francophone regions and countries.

<doc id="115636" wikidata="Q2734171" url="?curid=115636" title="Scott, Louisiana">
<text>Scott is the fourth largest municipality in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 8,614 as of the 2010 U.S. census, and 8,119 at the 2020 census, up from 7,870 at the 2000 census. Scott is a suburban community of Lafayette and is part of the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area in Acadiana.

==History==
In 1902, Gabby Anderson built a western-style saloon to serve as &quot;an exclusive, all-men&#x27;s bar and a meeting place for old folks.&quot; His reason for the saloon is because he believed &quot;this is where the West begins.&quot; However, it is believed that the slogan started because Scott was where eastern train fare rates ended and western train, referred to as the &quot;West Line&quot;, fare rates began.

The Union Pacific Railroad, formerly the Southern Pacific Railroad, cuts the town in two. The first settler of Scott was Alexander Delhomme, who took land in the northern part of the town. Delhomme owned the first hay-mowing machine, grist mill and cotton gin. By 1880, the train depot was completed and the town became a village. In 1907, the town was incorporated and named after J. B. Scott, who was division superintendent of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The village became a town in 1960, and the town became a city in 1990.

On April 12, 2012, Scott was designated by the Louisiana State Legislature as the &quot;Boudin Capital of the World&quot;, referring to Cajun sausage. This meant that two other Louisiana towns needed to relinquish their titles. Broussard, also in Lafayette Parish, is now known as the &quot;former Boudin Capital of the World&quot; but has adopted the unofficial title of &quot;Intergalactic Boudin Capital of Positive Infinity&quot;, and Jennings, in Jefferson Davis Parish, owns the title of &quot;Boudin Capital of the Universe&quot;. The city of Scott&#x27;s claim to the title is substantial, with more boudin purveyors per-capita than any other place in the state and a couple of the more prominent boudin makers to boot, no other city in Louisiana produces more links than Scott.

==Geography==
Scott is located in west-central Lafayette Parish at (30.237951, -92.091996). It shares its eastern and southern borders with Lafayette, the parish seat, and its northern border with unincorporated coummunity of Ossun.

U.S. Route 90 traverses the heart of Scott as Cameron Street, leading east to the center of Lafayette and the same distance west to Duson. Interstate 10 runs along the northern edge of Scott, accessible via Exit 97 (Louisiana Highway 93). This interstate stretches east to Baton Rouge, the state capital, and west to Lake Charles. Louisiana Highway 93 also cuts through the center of Scott, extending 23 miles (37 km) north and east to Arnaudville and south to the southern Lafayette.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Scott encompasses a total area of , all of it recorded as land.

<text>Youngsville is a city in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, United States, and is part of the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area. The population was 8,105 at the 2010 U.S. census, and 15,929 at the 2020 United States census.

Youngsville was the birthplace of Louisiana businessman and politician Dudley J. LeBlanc, the entrepreneur of the Hadacol fortune of the 1950s. Bernard LeBas of Ville Platte has represented Evangeline and St. Landry parishes in the Louisiana House of Representatives since 2008. He is a former resident of Youngsville.

==History==
Youngsville was settled in the early 19th century by French Acadian farmers. Prior to 1839, George Roy and his son, Desire, laid out the area and named the community &quot;Royville&quot;. The settlement had grown large enough by 1859 to establish one of the oldest Catholic churches in Lafayette Parish: St. Anne Church, on the community&#x27;s oldest street, Church Street. In 1908, the U.S. Postal Service asked village leaders to change the name because the town was being confused with the north Louisiana town of Rayville. So in 1908, the village of Youngsville was incorporated, with the name meaning &quot;young village&quot;. It chose a government of a mayor and three aldermen.
On January 20, 1983, Louisiana Governor David C. Treen declared Youngsville a town. The town increased its governing body to a mayor and five aldermen to accommodate its population.

Youngsville was the fastest growing town in Louisiana from 1990 to 2005. Its population has increased by over 300 percent. According to the 2010 U.S. census, Youngsville grew at a rate of 103% between year 2000 and 2010. Youngsville was declared a city by Governor Kathleen Blanco in 2006. In 2007, Mayor Wilson Viator and the Youngsville City Council named Joey Langlinais as the Chairman of the Centennial Committee.

Although the city has extended its boundaries and expanded its services, Youngsville has remained a rural city surrounded by sugarcane farms.

Youngsville is home of the Youngsville Sports Complex, Youngsville Recreation Center, Sugar Beach, Pixus Splash Park and the Youngsville Amphitheater. These facilities host over 1.2 million sports players and visitors every year.

==Transportation==
The city of Youngsville began construction of the Chemin Metairie Parkway Project in the spring of 2007 to improve the roads in and around Youngsville. The first segment, from the intersection of Highway 92 and Chemin Metairie, to central Youngsville, opened in early 2009. Originally called the Youngsville Parkway, the road was renamed to avoid confusion with the existing Youngsville Highway also known as Highway 89. Chemin Metairie Parkway joins Highway 90 near the Baker Hughes Complex in Broussard. A section of the parkway passes through the Sugar Mill Pond development and a new shopping complex anchored by Lafayette Parish&#x27;s first Rouse&#x27;s Grocery Store.

==History==
The area was named by the late postmaster Alzec Autin, who chose the name &quot;Galliano&quot; in honor of an original settler in the area formerly known as &quot;Côte Cheramie&quot;. Signor Antoine Galliano settled in the vicinity in the late 1700s and had a large farm and a citrus tree orchard. He came from the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the vicinity of Naples, Italy, where he was in the service of the King of Spain.

A popular local legend is that his wife, Julia, had no last name and was related closely to the King of Spain. Antoine Galliano or Galiano (Spanish spelling) had fallen in love with a lady of noble birth – probably a princess, since he was in the King&#x27;s Guard. He and his wife were sent to Louisiana (New Spain) and settled in the area known now as Galliano. His descendants still live in the area, and the name Galliano is spelled in the Italian style, but some descendants spell it Galiano in the Spanish tradition.

The area was also the home of a large Acadian French or Cajun population, and Cajun French is a predominant language along with English.

<text>Lockport is a town on Bayou Lafourche in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 2,490 in 2020. It is part of the Houma–Bayou Cane–Thibodaux metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Lockport, founded in 1835, traces its history to Jacques Lamotte, who in 1790 owned a large tract of land along Bayou Lafourche. Lemotte sold a portion of the tract to Messrs. Mercier and Marcantel in 1814. In 1823 William Field purchased a parcel of the land and later donated 5 arpents of it on both banks of Bayou Lafourche to Barataria and Lafourche Canal Company. As part of the transaction, the company agreed to build a canal, which would link Bayou Terrebonne to New Orleans. Allou D&#x27;Hemecourt surveyed the area in 1835. His map bears the name Longueville. Eventually, the village&#x27;s name would become Lockport.

At first the canal, completed in 1847, brought prosperity to the area. Three years later locks were completed at the point where the canal reached Bayou Lafourche. Shipping along the canal was brisk until 1868. After that time, part of the waterway was no longer in use. The crevasse of 1876 partially destroyed the locks. Today remnants of the brick bulwark are still visible under a blanket of weeds.

Lockport prospered in spite of the canal&#x27;s failure as a business venture. In 1849 the first public school opened. It was a one-room affair in Scanian&#x27;s Cooperage. In 1850 Holy Savior Catholic Church was dedicated, and in 1879 an order of nuns established Holy Savior School.

The Village of Lockport was incorporated in 1899, and a mayor and board of aldermen were named. At the turn of the century, the village boasted a post office, brick sidewalks, an iron bridge over the bayou, a newspaper, ice house, banks, hotels, liveries, blacksmith shop, clothing stores, grocery and general merchandise stores, and various other enterprises. The iron bridge created quite a stir among the populace. It joined Lockport to Rita, the settlement on the east bank of the bayou.

One of the worst calamities to touch the village occurred in 1916, when a disastrous fire destroyed a large part of the business area and several homes. As a result of this tragedy, a water tower was erected on Main Street near the present day Sheriff&#x27;s Annex, where it stood until Hurricane Betsy destroyed it in 1965.
By 1948 Lockport&#x27;s population had grown to the point where its status was changed from village to town. Its boundaries had been expanded, and later the site of the canal bridge was changed to fifth street, now Crescent Avenue. Highway 1 no longer ran along Main Street. Several businesses sprang up along the new route, and that area has become the business hub of the town.
Today Lockport is a progressive community, dependent upon a diversified economy, surrounded by industries such as shipbuilding, sugarcane farming, oil and gas exploration, cattle, fishing, and a variety of vegetable farms. Through the years Lockport has managed to retain its small town quality - a quality that welcomes visitors who travel along Bayou Lafourche, the longest street in the world

The fund was named after the brother and sister Camille and Braxton Hebert, who were murdered by their mother, Amy Hebert, on August 20, 2007. The playground at Lockport Lower has the text &quot;Braxton&#x27;s Buddies&quot;. Camille&#x27;s Court, at Lockport Upper, was scheduled to be a basketball court decorated with a plaque and flowerbed.
