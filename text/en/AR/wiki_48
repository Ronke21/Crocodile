<text>Hinckley is a city in Pine County, Minnesota, United States, located at the junction of Interstate 35 and Minnesota State Highway 48. The population was 1,800 at the 2010 census.

Hinckley&#x27;s name in the Ojibwe language is &quot;Gaa-zhiigwanaabikokaag&quot;, meaning &quot;the place abundant with grindstones&quot; due to being located along the Grindstone River. Portions of the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation are located within and adjacent to Hinckley.

On September 1, 1894, the Great Hinckley Fire killed more than 400 people.

Hinckley is generally considered the halfway point on Interstate 35 between Minneapolis–Saint Paul and Duluth.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Interstate Highway 35 and Minnesota Highway 23 (co-signed); and Minnesota Highway 48 are two of the main routes in Hinckley. Interstate 35 runs north–south; and Highway 48 (Fire Monument Road) runs east–west. Pine County 61 passes through downtown Hinckley.

Hinckley is along the Grindstone River. The Kettle River is also nearby.

Hinckley is the home of Grand Casino Hinckley, sister casino to Grand Casino Mille Lacs; which holds an associate count equal to the population of the city of Hinckley itself.

&quot;Camp Nathanael&quot; is located east of Hinckley on Highway 48.

==History==
The Ojibwe Indians were the first people to settle the Hinckley area. They trapped and hunted on the land and traded furs at the Mille Lacs and Pokegama trading posts.

When European settlers came to the Hinckley area, it was a heavily forested area with thick forests of white pine, some of the largest in the state. The first railroad arrived in Hinckley in 1869; and so began a logging and railroad expansion.

Hinckley was founded as the Village of &quot;Central Station&quot; in 1885, the village was re-incorporated as the City of Hinckley in 1907. Both names were after Hinckley Township where the city is located within. Surrounding Hinckley Township was known as &quot;Central Station&quot; by the railroads because of its position halfway between the Twin Ports of Duluth and Superior as well as the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Hinckley Township was named in 1870 after Isaac Hinckley, president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad.

By 1894, Hinckley was a prosperous community that had everything needed to serve residents and the fast-expanding lumber industry.

On September 1, 1894, everything changed with a firestorm wiping out Hinckley and many northeastern Minnesota towns. Today the Hinckley Fire Museum, nine blocks west of Interstate 35 in downtown Hinckley, tells the devastating story of what came to be called the Great Hinckley Fire and the town&#x27;s recovery from it. The museum is located in a restored railroad depot downtown, an exact replica of the pre-fire depot, built just after the fire.

After the fire, the burned stumps of the forests were cleared to take advantage of the now nutrient-rich soil. Hinckley&#x27;s recovery would hinge on agriculture. Some of the main crops were potatoes, fruits and vegetables. The early harvests were bountiful. Abundant clover helped feed milk cows for a brisk dairy industry.

Following the national trend in farming , Hinckley has lost most of its agricultural underpinnings.

The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe opened Grand Casino Hinckley in 1992.

<text>Pine City is a city in and the county seat of Pine County, in east central Minnesota, United States. The population was 3,130 at the 2020 census. Part of the city is on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation. Founded as a railway town, it soon became a logging community and the surrounding lakes made it a resort town. Today, it is in part as a commuter town for people working in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area.

==History==
The Dakota Indians were the first in the area. With the Ojibwe expansion, the area became a mixture of the two. By the early 19th century, the area became predominantly Ojibwe. They trapped and hunted on the land and traded furs at the nearby trading posts. With the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters, dubbed the &quot;White Pine Treaty&quot;, lumbering began in the area, but was limited by access to available waterways.

In the late 19th century, European settlers came to the Pine City area, which was still heavily forested with thick stands of white pine, some of the state&#x27;s largest. When the railroad arrived in Pine City, a logging expansion began. Pine City prospered and grew to have everything it needed to serve residents, farmers, and the expanding lumber industry. It was platted in 1869 and incorporated in 1881.

When Buchanan County merged with Pine County in 1861, the county seat was consolidated to Pine City because it was already well-established. Because of its location on the far southern edge of Pine County, there have been attempts over the years to move the county seat to more central Hinckley or Sandstone.

In 2005, Pine City became the first city in rural America with an annual gay pride event, East-Central Minnesota Pride. A book capturing Pine City&#x27;s history in vintage photos, part of the Images of America series, was published in 2010.

<text>Monster is a large village in the Dutch province of South Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Westland, and lies about south-west of The Hague.

The village of Monster has a population of around 11,580.
The statistical area Monster, which also can include the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 14,540.

Until 2004 it was a separate municipality and covered an area of (of which is water).

The former municipality of Monster also included the villages Poeldijk and Ter Heijde. Monster and Ter Heijde are located near the North Sea coast and have popular beaches.

==History==
In the 13th century a great deal of the Westland, Loosduinen and The Hague were administered by Monster. When The Hague came to be constructed, a split was made in Haag-ambacht and Half-Loosduinen. The latter village was separated from Monster in 1812. Remains of the former glory can still be seen between The Hague and Monster at such estates as &quot;Ockenburgh, Bloemendaal, Solleveld&quot; and &quot;Langeveld&quot;.

There is a great deal of uncertainty over the origin of the name &quot;Monster&quot;. It is probably derived from the Latin &quot;monasterium&quot;, meaning monastery. The name was also used for the ground that belonged to a monastery. Another explanation was that Monster was derived from the old-Dutch word &quot;monster&quot;, which meant amongst others &quot;big church&quot; (from Latin: &quot;monstrum&quot;), which is supported by the fact that Monster had in those days one of the largest churches in the area.

Monster was previously a destination for pilgrimage, because Machutus parish possessed some relics of its patron Machutus, who is also known as Machuut. People came to be healed of the &quot;falling sickness&quot;, which was possibly epilepsy.

<text>The French and Indian Wars were a series of conflicts that occurred in North America between 1688 and 1763, some of which indirectly were related to the European dynastic wars. The title &quot;French and Indian War&quot; in the singular is used in the United States specifically for the warfare of 1754–1763, which composed the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War and the aftermath of which led to the American Revolution. The French and Indian Wars were preceded by the Beaver Wars.

In Quebec, the various wars are generally referred to as the Intercolonial Wars. Some conflicts involved Spanish and Dutch forces, but all pitted the Kingdom of Great Britain, its colonies, and their Indigenous allies on one side against the Kingdom of France, its colonies, and its Indigenous allies on the other. A driving cause behind the wars was the desire of each country to take control of the interior territories of America, as well as the region around Hudson Bay; both were deemed essential to domination of the fur trade.

==Overview==

The North American wars, and their associated European wars, in sequence, are:

Naming conflicts after the British monarch of the day is a convention in United States history related to its early European settlement as majority-English colonies. Canadian convention uses the name of the larger European conflict (e.g., the &quot;War of the Grand Alliance&quot; rather than &quot;King William&#x27;s War&quot;) or refers to the wars as the Intercolonial Wars.

As the wars proceeded, the military advantage moved toward the British side. This was chiefly the result of the greater population and productive capacity of the British colonies compared with those of France. In addition, the British had the greater ability to resupply their colonies and project military power by sea. In the first three conflicts, the French were able to offset these factors largely by more effective mobilization of Indigenous allies, but they were finally overwhelmed in the fourth and last war.

The overwhelming victory of the British played a role in the eventual loss of their thirteen American colonies. Without the threat of French invasion, the American colonies saw little need for British military protection. In addition, the American people resented British efforts to limit their colonization of the new French territories to the west of the Appalachian Mountains, as stated in the Proclamation of 1763, in an effort to relieve encroachment on Indigenous territory. These pressures contributed to the American Revolutionary War.

The first three of the French and Indian Wars followed the same basic pattern: they all started in Europe and then moved to North America. Once the conflict broke out in North America, it was mostly fought by colonial militias. The final conflict broke this pattern by beginning in North America. In addition, the British used more regular troops alongside colonial militia. They returned almost none of the French territory seized during the war. France was forced to cede its extensive territory in present-day Canada and &quot;Louisiane&quot;. The British victory in the French and Indian Wars reduced France&#x27;s New World empire to St. Pierre and Miquelon (two islands off Newfoundland), a few West Indian islands, and French Guiana.

==Warfare==
===Operational goals===
The belligerents strove in general to control the major transportation and trade routes, not just the sea routes that connected the colonies with the mother country, or the land routes that existed between the different colonies, but also the major fur trade routes leading to the interior of North America. These were normally along lakes and rivers and stretching from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. Many indigenous Nations lived by these routes, and became involved in the wars between the great powers of Europe. The belligerents built fortified positions at major transportation hubs and requested the help of the local indigenous population to defend these, and to attack enemy positions.

===European tactics===
A common view is that European combat methods and military tactics were not adapted to the American forests and to the indigenous art of war. It is therefore conjectured that the English colonists designed new combat techniques, inspired by the Indigenous combat methods. These techniques, which included cover and stressed ambushes, is supposed to have been the reason why the colonists finally defeated the French, and then the British army during the American Revolutionary War. In reality, however, the French and Indian wars were finally won by Britain through the application of traditional European tactics. The Fortress of Louisbourg surrendered twice after sieges conducted according to the rules of European warfare, and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham 1759 was a European battle fought in closed formations in the open.

===Petty warfare===

Although ultimately futile, the French fought according to the tactical doctrine contemporaries called &quot;la Petite guerre&quot;, or today&#x27;s guerilla warfare. The numerical inferiority of the French forces in North America made it impossible to fight a war according to standard European tactics. Hence the French to a large extent made use of indigenous allies (see below). The small French population; New France&#x27;s dependence on the fur trade, mutually profitable for both French and indigenous peoples; and the common threat from the British colonies, made the indigenous peoples willing allies. The Battle of the Monongahela was the largest achievement of the petty warfare tactics. But at the end of the French and Indian War British numerical superiority became overwhelming, in spite of almost the whole male population of Canada being mobilized, and standard European tactics won the day and the war.

==European military forces==

===British===
The British military forces consisted of the British Army&#x27;s regular regiments and independent companies; the provincial regiments raised by the several colonies in British America, and the colonial militia.

====British Army====

The British Army had two types of units in North America: regular regiments serving in the colonies for a longer or shorter period of time, normally sent there only after the war had begun, and independent companies, permanently based in the colonies as garrisons of forts and fortresses. The British Army was largely recruited among the poor and the criminal classes; yet, the independent companies had lower status. Their ranks were often filled with people who had left the regular service – former soldiers mainly, but also deserters. The officers were often promoted non-commissioned officers. The independent companies became rooted in the local society, often transforming the military service into a sideline of a civilian occupation, and remaining in the colonies after expiration of the enlistment period.

====Provincial troops====
When war began, the several colonies organized their own military forces, provincial troops, through temporary enlistments. The soldiers came from the lower orders of society, which did not strengthen their reliability or efficiency. Massachusetts Bay, New York and Connecticut usually mobilized large contingents, while the southern colonies always very reluctantly contributed to the imperial cause. The British Army did not have high opinions of the battleworthiness of the provincial troops, with the exception of the ranger units. During conjoint operations the provincial troops were subject to the very strict British Articles of War. The officers of the provincial troops had lower relative rank than the officers of the regular army; a provincial field officer ranked as a senior British captain, although these officers were members of the colonial elite, often members of colonial legislatures. Disputes concerning rank and precedent between regular and provincial officers were common. Junior provincial officers were often popular militia officers, who easily could recruit a company of men.

====Colonial militia====

Each colony had its own militia, which in principle contained all able-bodied men 16 to 60 years of age. In reality, however, membership in the militia was restricted to the more substantial members of society, since every militiaman had to provide himself with a musket, knapsack, powder, bullets, flints, and sword. Each local community organized its own militia. The officers were either appointed by the governor or elected by the men. The main task of the local militia was local defense, rarely serving in the field but acting as a more or less efficient home guard.

===France===

The Compagnies Franches de la Marine, the colonial marines, contained the core of the military forces of New France. It was only during the French and Indian War that units from the French Royal Army were transferred to Canada. The colonial militia was more important than its counterpart in British America.

====Marines====

The French colonies were administered through the secretary of state for the navy, and naval troops garrisoned New France. The French marines were organized into independent companies called &quot;Compagnies franches.&quot; During the French and Indian War, naval gunner-bombardier companies were also stationed in North America. The other ranks of the marines were enlisted in France, but the officer corps became increasingly Canadian through recruitment of officers&#x27; sons. All promotions were by merit; purchase of commissions was prohibited. The British rangers were an attempt to replicate the tactics of the French colonial marines. The Swiss regiment de Karrer also operated under the Royal French Navy. Its depot was in Rochefort, but its companies served in North American and the Caribbean.

====French Army====

In 1754 six battalions from the regiments Artois, Béarn, Bourgogne, Guyenne, Languedoc, and La Reine were transferred to New France. In 1757 two additional battalions arrived from Royal Roussilon and La Sarre, followed the next year by two battalions from de Berry. An artillery company was also sent over the Atlantic.

====Colonial militia====

The Canadian colonial militia enjoyed a substantially higher morale and battleworthiness than the British provincial troops and the militia of the British colonies. This was only true, however, when they were employed as home guard or as wilderness warriors. Besides a combat role, the Canadian militia also fulfilled important tasks behind the lines, such as transportation and road building.

==Indigenous allies==
===British allies===
The Iroquois League played an important strategic role in the struggle between Britain and France over northeastern America because of its location east and south of Lake Ontario. The League&#x27;s aggressive military and commercial policy gave the five Iroquois nations control over large parts of the country, forcing many smaller Indigenous nations into submission. The Iroquois used the Covenant Chain to join with the colony of New York and other British colonies in a compact that generally benefitted the parties and ultimately was disastrous for France.

===French allies===

France recognized the independence of the Indigenous tribes while claiming sovereignty over their territory at the same time, as well as the right to plead the cause of their Indigenous allies in the face of other European powers. The French allies accepted this protectorate since it permitted self-government and a traditional lifestyle. The Mi&#x27;kmaq and the Abenaki accepted Catholicism as it confirmed their alliance with the French against British colonists in Nova Scotia. Alongside the Mi&#x27;kmaq and the Abenaki, France&#x27;s chief allies were the &quot;indiens domiciliés&quot; (resident Indians) who lived at the Catholic missions in New France. Many of these were Mohawk from their earlier territory in central New York, but there were also members of other tribes from New England. Fleeing attacks by New England colonists during and after King Philip&#x27;s War motivated their displacement to French territory. At the end of the French and Indian wars, all resident Indigenous peoples were joined in the confederation of the Seven Nations of Canada.

===Indigenous-White warfare===
A pattern of warfare emerged during the clashes between the European colonial powers and the American Indigenous peoples which characterized the four major French and Indigenous wars. The complex network of relations was fundamental between some Indigenous tribes and some colonies, the Indigenous tribes becoming the allies of the colonial powers. These alliances were a result of the economic ties that had been formed by the fur trade and by the Indigenous tribes&#x27; need for allies against their Indigenous rivals. The warfare included the widespread and escalating abuse of civilians on all sides, in which settlements were attacked, both Colonial and Indigenous, the residents killed or abducted, and houses and crops burned.

<text>Rutledge is a city in Pine County, Minnesota, United States, at the confluence of the Kettle and Pine Rivers. The population was 229 at the 2010 census.
Pine County 61 serves as a main route in the community. The Willard Munger Bicycle / Snowmobile Trail also passes through Rutledge.

==History==

Long before it ever became an incorporated village, a group of Indigenous Americans lived along the banks of the Kettle River from where the community is today to a point about five miles downstream. The Government Road, a.k.a. Military Road, between St. Paul, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin passed through that area in the 1860s. A bridge was constructed across the Kettle River at what was called the Rock Dam. On the south side of the river, a station was built, at which stagecoaches stopped to change horses and allow passengers to get out and stretch their legs and have a lunch. It was at this location where the first Europeans settled. In 1870, the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad was completed in this region. A depot was built about two and one half miles upstream from the Rock Dam, named Kettle River Station. The community began to grow near the railroad station. On February 14, 1893, an election was held at the school house to decide whether the settlement should be incorporated as a village. A total of 22 votes were cast, 19 favoring incorporation. The Village of Rutledge was named after local lumberman Edward Rutledge, who had built several mills in the area. James D. McCormack served as the first Mayor of Rutledge.

==History==
The Village of Fortuna was platted by Caleb C. Ward and incorporated on May 19, 1857. It was originally platted at the junction of the Point Douglas to Superior Military Road and Kettle River. Fortuna served as the county seat for Buchanan County, Minnesota. By 1887, it had 200 residents. Just north of Fortuna, the Village of Sandstone was platted in June 1887 and incorporated on September 28, 1887. On April 14, 1920, the villages of Fortuna and Sandstone merged and reincorporated as the City of Sandstone.

The city&#x27;s name in the Ojibwe language is () due to the sandstone quarry at the edge of the city.

<text>Willow River is a city in Pine County, Minnesota, United States, at the confluence of the Kettle and Willow Rivers. The population was 415 at the 2010 census.

Interstate 35, County Road 43, and County 61 (Cross Street) are three of the main routes in the community.

== History ==
The first known settlement in what was to become the Village of Willow River, at the junctions of the Willow and Kettle Rivers, was an encampment of Indigenous Ojibwe peoples.

In July 1850, a roadway connecting the upper Mississippi River and the Lake Superior country, named the Point Douglas to St. Louis River Road, and more commonly known as the government military road, went from just south of St. Paul to Duluth. Willow River was chosen as a changing station for the coach horses.

In 1861 the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad was organized with the financial help of Jay Cooke. It was only in August 1879 that the completed line from St. Paul to Duluth was opened. The railroad helped settle and promote living in the northern part of Minnesota. The railroad also promoted the lumber industry. Many towns and villages, including Willow River, were organized once a lumber company set up shop.

In March 1874, the Kettle River Township was organized and Willow River at this time consisted of a railroad depot, water tank, wood yard, and two section houses built for the railroad hands.

Pine County records show that the three sections of land that would eventually make up the village of Willow River were homesteaded by Edward Clough, Albert Kinney, Peter Jarvis, Joseph Nebula, and Richard Abbott. In 1886, Abbott sold his section of land to the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company. In 1888, Jarvis sold his section to Fox-Wisdom. In the spring of 1890, Warren D. Fox and John Wisdom opened the Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company in Willow River. The company then platted the land to build their business and offer lots for employees. By 1895, Kinney had leased his land to Fox-Wisdom, and Clough had sold all but 80 acres of his section in the northern part of the village. Joseph Nebula&#x27;s section was past the lake and likely unusable to the company.

The Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company sawmill was constructed and opened in March 1890. It was located on the south side of the present day Willow River dam. To ease the flow of logs, dams were built along the river to store water. There were as least three built and maintained by Fox-Wisdom. They were known as the &quot;Mile and a Half,&quot; the &quot;Willow Lake,&quot; and the &quot;Oak Lake&quot; dams. Sawmill operations began in the early spring and continued until the freeze-up of the mill pond. The mill produced lumber, lath, and shingles employing about 125 men. The mill cut 125,000 feet of lumber per day during their peak season. Many who worked in the logging camps during the winter came to the mill to work in the spring.

On May 8, 1891, the village plat was filed in Pine County. The Fox-Wisdom Lumber Company and its employees made up the majority of property owners. Willow River, like many other villages in northern Minnesota, owed its existence to the lumber industry. In November 1891, Willow River was incorporated as a village by a vote of 37 to 18 in the upstairs hall of the Fox-Wisdom Company store.

Until 1970, there was only one class in the Minnesota High School Basketball Tournament.

The smallest school to ever win the state title was the 1960 Edgerton Flying Dutchmen with an enrollment, at that time, of 94 students. Although much more well known, the 1954 Milan High School basketball team of Hoosiers fame, who won the one-class Indiana High School Boys Basketball Tournament, had an enrollment more than 50% larger than Edgerton at 161 students.

Edgerton would upset Mankato in the Region 2 tournament, then defeat Chisholm and Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of the Twin Cities, in the first two games of the state tournament before upending perennial powerhouse Austin in the championship game, 72–61. Four of Edgerton&#x27;s five starters (Dean Verdoes, Dean Veenhof, Darrell Kreun, and Leroy Graphenteen) would be named to the 1960 All-Tournament Team. Edgerton finished the 1960 season undefeated at 27–0.

The Calumet Inn in downtown Pipestone is a restored historical building from 1888. It still operates as a functioning hotel. It features turn-of-the-century (19th to 20th) antiques and interesting architecture. The building was constructed using quartzite both structurally and in the facade. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The county Courthouse, also made of local quartzite stone, was built in 1899. The building is the most stylized of the quartzite buildings. It is rectangular in shape with a 110-ft clock tower topped with a dome and a statue of Lady Justice. It was restored in 1995 and rededicated in 1996. It is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Native Americans have used the pipestone quarries located at the Pipestone National Monument for centuries to obtain materials for pipe making, a practice that continues today. On the site are a visitor and cultural center, 3/4 mile walking trail along Pipestone Creek, and Winnewissa Falls set in the tallgrass prairie. Pipestone Indian Shrine Association provides visitors with a selection of American Indian art and craft items. The pipestone quarry is described in Native American legends as a square-cut jewel lying upon folds of shimmering green velvet. This is an accurate depiction of the red quartzite almost hidden by prairie grass. It was designated a national monument by the United States in 1937.

Jenkins, along with his son, Steve, managed to lure the president of the Buffalo Ridge State Bank in Ruthton, Rudy Blythe Jr., and the bank&#x27;s loan officer, Toby Thulin, onto a lonely farmhouse road. Jenkins murdered both bankers, then fled to Texas, where he walked into an open field, carefully took his eyeglasses off, put a shotgun into his mouth and pulled the trigger. Steve Jenkins later stood trial in Minnesota on accessory charges.

<text>Badger Township is a township in Polk County, Minnesota, United States. It is part of the Grand Forks-ND-MN Metropolitan Statistical Area. Under the United States Public Land Survey System it is a survey township identified as Township 149 North, Range 42 West, Fifth Principal Meridian. The population was 166 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Badger Township is located at the eastern edge of the Red River Valley. The township is located entirely within the drainage of the Clearwater River and its tributaries, which in turn flow into the Red Lake River, the Red River of the North, and on to Hudson Bay. Most of the township is part of the glacial moraine that formed the southeast shore of prehistoric Lake Agassiz. According to the United States Census Bureau, Badger Township has a total area of , of which is land and (1.33%) is water. It is located near geocoordinates 47.73N, 96.03W. 
==Demographics==

===Demographic trends===
Badger Township is an area undergoing rural depopulation. The highest population shown by United States Census data was 448 in 1900. The population then dipped to 391 in 1910, rose back to 447 in 1920, and fell back to 350 in 1930. The population has been in decline ever since.

===Current demographics (2000 Census)===
As of the census of 2000, there were 166 people, 46 households, and 31 families residing in the township. The population density was . There were 57 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the township was 95.78% White, 3.01% Native American, and 1.20% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.01% of the population.

There were 46 households, out of which 32.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.5% were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.6% were non-families. 30.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.52 and the average family size was 3.10.

In the township the population was spread out, with 19.3% under the age of 18, 5.4% from 18 to 24, 17.5% from 25 to 44, 13.9% from 45 to 64, and 44.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 52 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.2 males.

Only 3 of the 166 people in Badger Township in 2000 (1.8%) were foreign born. Of those born in the United States, 95 were born in Minnesota, 52 were born elsewhere in the Midwest, 6 were born in the South, 2 were born in the West and 0 were born in the Northeast.

The median income for a household in the township was $25,625, and the median income for a family was $33,750. Males had a median income of $26,875 versus $25,417 for females. The per capita income for the township was $16,999. About 6.7% of families and 8.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those under the age of eighteen and 6.1% of those 65 or over.

===Early demographics (1900 Census)===

As of the census of 1900, Badger Township had 448 people in 91 households, a density of 12.44 people per square mile, more than 2½ times as many people as in 2000. The population in 1900 was overwhelmingly Norwegian, with 72 heads of households (79.12%) having been born in Norway, 6 (6.59%) born in Sweden, 4 (4.40%) born in Wisconsin, 3 (3.30%) born in Denmark, 2 (2.20%) born in Minnesota, and 1 (1.10%) in each of Michigan, Illinois and Canada.

One hundred percent (100%) of the population in 1900 was reported as white. One family consisting of four individuals (4.40% of the township population) had a French surname (Dion) and another family from Wisconsin had a likely Yankee surname (Gundy). Other than these, every surname of residents in the township was obviously of Scandinavian origin. Of all residents in the township in 1900, 84 (17.21%) were born in the United States, and 404 (82.79%) were of foreign birth. Not a single resident of Badger Township in 1900 who had been born in the United States was born in a state other than Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, North Dakota or Wisconsin. The vast majority of these were born in Minnesota, most of them children.

A surprising number of those born in the United States but not in Minnesota (11, or 2.25% of the total population) were born in North Dakota, indicating that at least some of the families in Badger Township had initially traveled further west before settling (at least temporarily) in Minnesota. The rest had migrated directly from Scandinavia or from the immediately adjoining states in the Upper Midwest.

No persons of Native American descent were listed in the Census of 1900, nor were there any persons of Hispanic descent, Asian or Pacific Islander descent, or Black, Negro or African American descent. In 1900, the Census focused more upon ethnicity as defined by country of origin rather than racial background, but it is noteworthy that no residents of Badger Township in the Census of 1900 were of German, English, Slavic, Italian or Southern European descent.

==History==
===European occupancy and settlement===

====Pre-European contact====
There were no permanent settlements in Badger Township prior to European settlement. The territory was traversed by occasional Ojibwe and Dakota hunting expeditions and may have been a seasonal food-gathering area for Ojibwe families, but was otherwise unpeopled until the mid-19th century. Indian artifacts, including grinding rocks, were excavated near Badger Creek in the SW 1/4 of Section 8 in the mid-1960s, indicating a periodic visitation pattern but no permanent residency. Bison roamed over Badger Township into the 1870s, and were actively pursued by Indians and Metis from the Pembina Settlements. Several bison skulls and skeletal remains thought to be over 2000 years old, as well as an Indian grinding rock, were unearthed in a peat bog by the Nikolayson family in Section 33 in the 1960s, and now are on display in the University of Minnesota in nearby Crookston.

====Native land cessions and incorporation into United States territory====
Badger Township is not connected with any verifiable native or European historic events or circumstances until transfer in the Treaty of Old Crossing (1863) and the Treaty of Old Crossing (1864), which included extensive other areas and involved no physical acts within the township. Prior to that time, the territory now included in Badger Township was within the watershed of the Red River Valley and hence technically a part of Rupert&#x27;s Land and Assiniboia before becoming part of British Canada as a result of the boundary settlement in the Treaty of 1818, a which fixed the international border at the 49th parallel north from the Northwest Angle of Lake of the Woods westward to the Rocky Mountains.

====Red River Trail====
The easternmost Red River Trail between Pembina, North Dakota and St. Paul, Minnesota crossed the Red Lake River at Huot, Minnesota (the site of the Treaty of Old Crossing (1863)), which is a few miles northwest of Badger Township in what is now Red Lake County, Minnesota. The trail skirted the western edges of adjoining Grove Park-Tilden Township, Minnesota and Knute Township, Minnesota but is not generally considered to have crossed into the territory of Badger Township. (Since Red River ox cart trains used in trading expeditions between Pembina and St. Paul, Minnesota included many family members and hunters in addition to the oxcart drivers, they tended to spread out across the prairie except at key fords and crossings. It is likely that people in the trains entered what is now Badger Township many times before the extension of the railroad to Fargo, North Dakota put the Red River ox carts out of business in the early 1860s. Thereafter, while there is no specific record of its occupation prior to 1880, the history of the township is essentially indistinguishable from areas to the west, north and east in Northwest Minnesota).

====Initial Euro-American settlement====
Badger Township was traversed by trappers and traders, including Indians, Métis and other half-breed people as well as white men incidental to the fur trade between 1790 and 1870. In 1797, the North West Company established a fur trading post approximately 15 miles northwest of Badger Township at the confluence of the Red Lake River and the Clearwater River, near the current site of Red Lake Falls. The American Fur Company, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and several other fur trading companies had active trapping and trading operations throughout the Red River Valley and Red Lake region prior to 1858. After Minnesota statehood, although the area remained unsurveyed and closed to settlement, some squatters may have encroached into the territory of Badger Township as permanent settlers before 1880. The township was not opened for settlement until 1883, when as part of the &quot;Thirteen Towns&quot; of eastern Polk County it was finally surveyed as a township and made available for homestead under the Homestead Act. Most of the township was initially settled by Norwegian immigrants in the late 1880s. The subsequent history of Badger Township is virtually indistinguishable from that of most of Northern Minnesota. Virtually all of the land was homesteaded or sold as railroad land to farmers.

===Current land use and occupancy===
Badger Township is essentially agricultural in character, although a large percentage of it is of marginal quality with thin, sandy soils or swampland and potholed, essentially abandoned or unused for any cropland or pasturage purpose. As a result, much of the land is now included in wildlife management areas, including Kakaik State Wildlife Management Area, Erskine State Wildlife Management Area, and Polk State Wildlife Management Area, and much of the remainder of the township has been enrolled as CRP land.

==Business==
Until recently, no active business enterprises were operating in Badger Township, excepting farming operations which are mostly family owned. A general store and railroad depot were in operation in Cisco until the late 1940s, and a few other home-operated family businesses may have had a fleeting existence, but none have endured. For example, the C.C. Spray Service operated between 1964 and 1966, providing Carbola whitewashing services to Grade A dairy farms throughout Northwestern Minnesota and Northeastern North Dakota. 
A large grain terminal, including a mile-long circular siding capable of holding a 110-car freight train, is now operating in Section 32 of Badger Township on the east side of along County Road 18, south of Highway 2 and the Great Northern Railway (BNSF). This facility, known as the Erskine Grain Terminal, was developed in 2006–2007 by the grain co-ops of Oklee, Newfolden and Winger to allow area growers to assemble trainloads of grain for direct shipment to market in order to meet current freight pricing policies of the railroads.

==Community organizations==
There is no incorporated or unincorporated community of any size within Badger Township, although the former places known as Sletten and Cisco were located within its territory.
The nearest towns are Erskine, Mentor and Brooks, all located outside the township. There are no stoplights and no paved roads (other than a state highway and a US highway which pass through the township&#x27;s eastern and southern fringes). The township is managed by a town board which mainly provides for road grading. The only public building in the township is a town hall on the north side of Section 21. There are no school buildings although at one time there were several; the township now is served by Win-E-Mac School District, near Erskine. There is one historically active church (Saron Lutheran Church) and one new church (the brand new Old Believers Church on the southwest quarter of Section 17, built in 2003), within the township, and there are four cemeteries (one at Saron Lutheran Church, another on Section 32 known as the Broderheim cemetery, a third at the northeast corner of Section 17 known as Sorum Cemetery, and the fourth and newest just established on the southwest quarter of Section 17 by the Old Believers Church).

==Name==
Climax, founded in 1896, was named after a chewing tobacco company. The town&#x27;s name has been a source of humor, and the slogan selected for the centennial was &quot;Climax. More than just a feeling.&quot; Less well attested is the assertion that some unnamed local newspaper, reporting the death of a resident of nearby Fertile, Minnesota, ran a report of her death under the headline &quot;Fertile Woman dies in Climax&quot;.

<text>Crookston is a city in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is the county seat of Polk County. The population was 7,482 at the 2020 census. It is part of the &quot;Grand Forks, ND-MN Metropolitan Statistical Area&quot; or &quot;Greater Grand Forks&quot;.

Crookston is the episcopal seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Crookston. Crookston is partially a commuter town to the larger city of Grand Forks, North Dakota.

==History==
===Early history===
The Crookston area was virtually unoccupied until European contact and remained little more than a hunting ground associated with the Pembina settlements until the 1860s. The land in Crookston&#x27;s immediate vicinity is not connected with any verifiable Native American or European historic events or circumstances until transfer in the Treaties of Old Crossing in 1863–64. Before that, the territory now included in Crookston was part of Rupert&#x27;s Land and Assiniboia before becoming part of the United States as a result of the boundary settlement in the Treaty of 1818.

The Crookston area was traversed by trappers and traders, including Ojibwa and Lakota, Métis, and European settlers, between 1790 and 1870. A branch of the Red River Trails passed nearby; it was used by fur traders between the 1840s and 1870s.

===Settlement===
The present-day site of Crookston first saw settlement by non-Indian people around 1872. It was the site of a federal land office by 1876 and sited on a portion of the Great Northern Railway that began operation by 1880. The town was incorporated on April 1, 1879 as &quot;Queen City&quot;. By the end of that year, the town had a jail, graded streets, and a few plank sidewalks. Soon, it was decided that the town needed a new name. Two factions emerged supporting two different names. One wished to honor the town&#x27;s first mayor, Captain Ellerey C. Davis, with the name Davis. Another group picked the name Crookston to honor Colonel William Crooks, a soldier and railroad builder. The name was reportedly chosen by coin toss.

Soon, Scandinavian, French-Canadian, and German immigrants began populating Crookston. At one point, eight different railroad lines reached the town, and it became a center of commerce and manufacturing.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Crookston sits in the fertile Red River Valley, once a part of glacial Lake Agassiz. As Lake Agassiz receded, it left behind rich mineral deposits. This made the area around Crookston prime for agricultural uses. Grains such as wheat and other crops, including sugar beets and potatoes, grow well in the area around Crookston.

Crookston has a relatively flat landscape. The Red Lake River flows through the city and makes several twists and turns (oxbows). The riverbank has eroded somewhat.

U.S. Highways 2 and 75 and Minnesota State Highways 9 and 102 are four of the main routes in the community.

Crookston is the northern terminus of the Agassiz Recreational Trail, a 53-mile multi-use trail built on an abandoned railroad grade that has its southern terminus at Ulen.

<text>East Grand Forks (also known as EGF) is a city in Polk County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 9,176 at the 2020 Census, making it the largest community in Polk County.

It is located in the Red River Valley region along the eastern bank of the Red River of the North, directly across from the larger city of Grand Forks, North Dakota. The cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks form the center of the Grand Forks, ND–MN Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is often called Greater Grand Forks. The population was 104,362 at the 2020 Census.

==History==
A post office called East Grand Forks has been in operation since 1883. The city was named for its location east of Grand Forks, North Dakota. East Grand Forks was incorporated on April 13, 1887.

===Flood of 1997===
East Grand Forks, along with Grand Forks, was heavily damaged by a major flood in 1997. The entire city was under a mandatory evacuation and almost no homes were spared damage. After the flood, several neighborhoods had to be demolished because of damage. The city cleared development from the floodplain bordering the Red and Red Lake rivers. It developed a large park known as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway to provide a new recreation area for residents along the river. A similar park was developed in Grand Forks, North Dakota on the opposite side of the river. The parklands, with trees and a variety of greenery, can absorb floodwaters and help protect the cities naturally. Moving residential and business development out of these areas also helps prevent future flood damage. In addition, a new system of dikes was constructed to protect the city from future flooding.

The city has rebuilt. New businesses attracted to the downtown include a Cabela&#x27;s sporting goods store and Moore Theaters.

The history of Northland Community &amp; Technical College&#x27;s East Grand Forks campus dates back to December 1971, when the local school district was designated for an Area Vocational Technical Institute (AVTI). The first classes of the East Grand Forks AVTI were offered in January 1973 in rented facilities. The present facility opened in April 1975. Northland - EGF grew with expansion and partnerships.

The name of the college changed several times throughout its history. One of its most prominent consolidations was as Northwest Technical College from 1992-2003.

In July 2003, the East Grand Forks campus of Northwest Technical College merged with Northland Community &amp; Technical College of Thief River Falls to become a fully comprehensive college. The 2-year school has seen steady growth in enrollment in the past 5 years. Across the Red River in Grand Forks is the University of North Dakota.

After the Flood of 1997, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommended against replacing residential or business development in the floodplain. The land on both sides of the river was developed as a park and state recreation area, known as the Red River State Recreation Area. This is a part of the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. It provides a place for residents to enjoy recreation near the river, as well as protecting the cities. The trees and greenery in this zone can help absorb future seasonal flooding.

==Culture==

Erskine&#x27;s town festival is known as the Erskine Water Carnival and held in early June. The Erskine Fish, the concrete statue that is the world&#x27;s largest northern pike and the town&#x27;s principal tourist attraction, is on a lawn in a small park on the shore of Cameron Lake, just down the street from downtown Erskine. In addition, it is the center of a community of Russian Old Believers estimated at between 50 and 100 families. The Old Believers began moving to Erskine around 1998 to escape a farming crisis and suburban sprawl that threatened their community near Woodburn, Oregon.

==Parks, recreation and public facilities==
The Rydell National Wildlife Refuge is along County Road 238 about west of Erskine and miles south of U.S. Highway 2. The Oak Lake Golf Course is just east of town at the intersection of Highway 2 and U.S. Highway 59. The best local resort and fishing areas are Maple Lake, a lake near Mentor, and Maple Bay, as well as Union Lake and Lake Sarah, a few miles south of Erskine. Erskine&#x27;s sewage was dumped into Cameron Lake until the Clean Water Act of 1970 forced the town to redirect its sewage to the new sewer plant near Badger Lake. Former residents and old-timers recall that the shores of Cameron Lake were littered with dead fish in the old days. Today the lake is much cleaner, and with the rising costs of lakeshore property in the area, there is an increase in development on the lakeshore.

==Schools==
Erskine is served by a consolidated multi-community K–12 school district known as &quot;Win-E-Mac&quot; , which represents McIntosh and Winger in addition to Erskine. A vocational and technical college is in Thief River Falls. The nearest four-year colleges in the vicinity include a branch campus of the University of Minnesota in Crookston and Bemidji State University in Bemidji, in addition to the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks and North Dakota State University in Fargo.

==Media==
===Telephone and internet service===
The oldest telephone cooperative in the state, Garden Valley Telephone Company, is headquartered in Erskine and serves most of northwestern Minnesota. It was formed to provide telephone coverage to the region at a time when it was difficult to get phone service to the area. Garden Valley Telephone Company now provides internet service, although other ISPs also serve the area. The Erskine telephone prefix is 687, formerly Murray 7, and the area code is 218.

===Newspapers===
Erskine is home to the &quot;Erskine Echo&quot;, a weekly newspaper that began publishing before 1900. Other weekly papers include the &quot;McIntosh Times&quot; and &quot;The 13 Towns&quot; (published in Fosston for the 13 townships of eastern Polk County). Area daily papers include the &quot;Crookston Times&quot;, &quot;Grand Forks Herald&quot;, &quot;The Forum&quot;, &quot;The Bemidji Pioneer&quot;, and the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, available by subscription and in vendor boxes.

===Radio and television===
Erskine has no radio or television stations, but nearby Fosston is home to three radio stations. Radio and TV stations from Bemidji, Crookston, Thief River Falls, Grand Forks, Fargo, and Winnipeg can be picked up in Erskine.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
Erskine is just west of the intersection of U.S. Highway 59 and four-lane U.S. Highway 2, and about east of Interstate 29 at Grand Forks, North Dakota, and north of Interstate 94 at Fergus Falls.

===Air transport===
The nearest airports with commercial service are Bemidji ( east), Thief River Falls ( north) and Grand Forks ( west). An uninstrumented grass airfield known as the Erskine Airport was in operation from 1954 until the early 1970s, but no longer exists. Nearby Fosston ( east) and Crookston ( west) both have private aviation airfields.

===Rail transport===
At the historic junction of the Great Northern Railway and the Soo Line Railroad, Erskine used to appear prominently on many national railroad maps and atlases that omitted much larger cities and towns in the vicinity. Both lines are still in place today, with the Great Northern tracks now owned by the BNSF Railway and the Soo Line tracks by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Erskine&#x27;s freight depot, while still standing, is closed for business, and rail passenger service was discontinued many years ago.

===Bus services===
Greyhound Bus Lines no longer serves Erskine, but Jefferson Lines has taken over the Fargo-Minneapolis route it served. The Tri-Valley Heartland Express Bus provides scheduled weekly or biweekly service to Crookston, Bemidji, Thief River Falls and other destinations for seniors and others on an advance reservation basis.

==Business and manufacturing==
===Historic businesses===
Until 1980, Erskine was mostly a service community for the local agricultural community. In the early 1900s, the town had four grain elevators, an ice plant, a lumber mill and several blacksmith shops. Even as late as 1980, the town businesses included a grain elevator, a creamery, a lumber yard, a fuel delivery service, and several farm implement dealers, junkyards and repair shops. As family farming in the area declined, the agricultural services component has diminished as larger growers took their supply and services business to larger communities.

===Erskine Attachments===
Erskine was once the home of Erskine Attachments, formerly known as Erskine Manufacturing Company, established in 1948. The company began as a manufacturer of heavy equipment snowblowers and grain hitch elevators before changing its name to Erskine Attachments when it began manufacturing a line of Skid Steer Attachments for the Ingersoll Rand Bobcat company. Now private, Erskine Attachments manufactures more than 40 skid steer attachments including brush mowers, snowblowers, blades, buckets, grapples, post drivers, stump grinders, tree shears, and others that fit all skid steers and some front-end loaders that utilize the skid steer style quick attach mechanism. Erskine Attachments was used as a pilot for the Minnesota JOBZ incentive program to revitalize Minnesota&#x27;s manufacturing opportunities and has been referenced for its continuance as a viable success story. Erskine Attachments is now just outside of Fosston.

===Other businesses===
Other significant employers include Garden Valley Telephone Company and the Pioneer Memorial Care Center, a nursing home and retirement community. In 2008, Crookston-based Agassiz Energy, LLC, announced that it had indefinitely postponed its plans for a $58.5 million ethanol plant at the junction of the former Great Northern and Soo Line railroads, near the interchange of U.S. Routes 59 and 2.

The Fertile Sand Hills are Minnesota&#x27;s only such dune field.

The areas east and west of town, however, are prime for corn, soybeans, wheat, sunflowers, oats, barley, sugar beets (to the west of Fertile), berries, hay, potatoes, vegetables, and much more. Livestock used to be a big area of agriculture for Fertile. Remaining livestock production is mainly beef cattle, with a few dairy farms.

==Education==

The school is a K-12 grade building shared by Fertile and the smaller community of Beltrami, which is about 12 miles to the west. The school&#x27;s team is the Fertile Falcons, which includes softball, baseball, basketball, volleyball, football, and golf.

Advance Com

It is managed by Year-3 computer students who &quot;apply&quot; and manage the school, and other websites that pay the business to update throughout the year. The business also takes on video editing jobs on occasion.

Knowledge Bowl

Knowledge Bowl is a question-based competition in Minnesota. The first round is a test taken by five team members to determine their ranking.

==History==
In the year 1876 the first white settlers came to the Fosston area, arriving in covered wagons, bringing with them a few cattle, oxen, horses and mules. Charles Adair, with his family was the first to file a claim on the land, with nine others soon following. Fosston, is located in sections 3 and 4 of Rosebud Township, and was named in honor of Louis Foss, an immigrant from the village Nyttingnes in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. The townsite was organized by W. J. Hilligoss, who selected and purchased the townsite in 1884, had it surveyed, platted a four-block area, and built a hotel. Hilligoss died in 1941. The town was named Fosston when Louis Foss moved his store and opened a post office there. The village was incorporated on August 22, 1895. The incorporation papers of Fosston were recorded June 8, 1889, by the Register of Deeds in Crookston, the County Seat of Polk County, Minnesota. Fosston was a busy depot on the Great Northern Railway line.

===Cordwood Pete===
In an effort to promote tourism in Fosston, the legend of &quot;Cordwood Pete&quot; was created by Arvid Clementson, who served as Fosston&#x27;s mayor until his death in 2006. In what he described as a &quot;true story, embellished&quot;, Clementson claimed the complete story of Cordwood Pete was discovered in the spring of 2001 when a time capsule was discovered during the demolition of one of Fosston&#x27;s oldest buildings.

Cordwood Pete, was said to be the younger brother of famed lumberjack Paul Bunyan. While Paul Bunyan was a giant, Pete was a mere 4 feet 9 inches in height. According to the tale, Pete&#x27;s growth was stunted by the fact that he could never get enough flapjacks at the breakfast table because brother Paul ate everything in sight.

According to legend, Paul Bunyan left his home in Bangor, Maine, to make his way in the world, and ended up in the north woods of Minnesota where he excelled as a lumberjack. Pete, tired of being mocked by lumberjacks in Maine over his size, followed Paul to Minnesota, and despite his diminutive stature, found work as a lumberjack near Fosston, Minnesota, taking the name Peter Delang.

Local lumberjacks nicknamed him &quot;Cordwood Pete&quot; because his size suggested he was more suited to cutting cordwood than felling huge trees. Pete spent much time in the local saloons, and his fellow lumberjacks soon learned he was hot tempered and full of spunk, especially after imbibing. They came to admire his feisty spirit, and no one dared fight the little man.

Legend has it that he &quot;borrowed&quot; his brother&#x27;s double-bladed ax one day. When he swung it, the weight of the huge ax kept it spinning round and round as if in perpetual motion. When the ax finally stopped spinning, 100 acres of timber had been felled. The railroad hired Pete the next day to clear a path for their tracks, and before the day was over, he had clear-cut fifty square miles of timber. Pete had to give his brother&#x27;s ax back to him the next day, and he never again achieved such a lumberjacking feat.

After that Pete stuck to cutting cordwood, which he hauled to market with the help of his little donkey named Tamarack. He died at the age of 84.

Authors Richard Dorson and Marshall Fitwick cite Paul Bunyan as an example of &quot;fakelore&quot;, or a modern story passed off as an older folktale. Cordwood Pete may also qualify as a more modern example of fakelore.

===High School sports===
Fosston&#x27;s boys basketball team won the first-ever state basketball championship in 1913. In 2002, the girls basketball team set the state consecutive win record, winning 78 games between 1999 and 2002.

<doc id="121420" wikidata="Q1137675" url="?curid=121420" title="Crore">
<text>Crore (; abbreviated cr) denotes the quantity ten million (107) and is equal to 100 lakh in the Indian numbering system. In many international contexts, the decimal quantity is formatted as 10,000,000, but when used in the context of the Indian numbering system, the quantity is usually formatted 1,00,00,000.

Crore is widely used both in official and other contexts in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;crore&quot; derives from the Prakrit word , which in turn comes from the Sanskrit (), denoting ten million in the Indian number system, which has separate terms for most powers of ten from 100 up to 1019. The &quot;crore&quot; is known by various regional names.

==Money==
Large amounts of money in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan are often written in terms of &quot;crore&quot;. For example 150,000,000 (one hundred and fifty million) rupees is written as &quot;fifteen &quot;crore&quot; rupees&quot;, &quot;15 crore&quot;. In the abbreviated form, usage such as &quot;15 cr&quot; is common.

Trillions (in the short scale) of money are often written or spoken of in terms of &quot;lakh crore&quot;. For example, &quot;one trillion rupees&quot; is equivalent to:

* 1 lakh crore
* 1012
* 10,00,00,00,00,000 in Indian notation
* 1,000,000,000,000 in metric notation

<text>Farwell is a city in Pope County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 56 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Farwell was platted in 1887. A post office was established at Farwell in 1887, and remained in operation until 1998. Since 1998 the City has had a community post office arrangement with the United States Post Office wherein the City pays the wages of the Post Mistress but she is an employee of the USPS.

When the Minneapolis and Pacific Railway, forerunner of the Soo Line, was constructed through what became Farwell in 1886, the company took the lead in creating the new townsites that adjoined its stations by arranging for the surveying, platting and sale of lots.   Among the key people involved were William D. Washburn, president, Peter M. Dahl, surveyor, and Charles D. Hammond who managed real estate matters.  Messrs. Washburn, Hammond, and Frederick D. Underwood, general manager, were directly involved in naming these new townsites, along with assigning street/avenue names.  

Farwell.   Local histories muse that the name might have been attributed to a Swedish accented attendee at a local meeting, called for the purpose of naming the new town, who exclaimed &#x27;farval&#x27; or &#x27;farewell&#x27; as he left in disgust when a name could not be agreed upon.  It&#x27;s a humorous anecdote, but does not comport with how townsite names were selected.  In actuality, Farwell was likely named for Charles B. Farwell, of Illinois, a political colleague of Washburn&#x27;s.  They served together in the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, D.C., during 1881-1883, and later in the US Senate for a few years beginning in 1889.   That explanation was given by F. D. Underwood in correspondence with a Soo Line official several years later.  It is interesting to note that Chas. Hammond&#x27;s wife&#x27;s maiden name was Farwell.  It is possible that when the plat was developed Mr. Hammond seized on that coincidence, giving a double-meaning to the naming of this village.   Among Farwell&#x27;s street names, Bertrand was the middle name of one of Charles Hammond&#x27;s sons.

<doc id="121439" wikidata="Q367523" url="?curid=121439" title="Columbus Day">
<text>Columbus Day is a national holiday in many countries of the Americas and elsewhere, and a federal holiday in the United States, which officially celebrates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s arrival in the Americas. He went ashore at Guanahaní, an island in the Bahamas, on October 12, 1492 [OS]. On his return in 1493, he moved his coastal base of operations 70 miles east to the island of Hispaniola, what is now the Dominican Republic and established the settlement of La Isabela, the first permanent Spanish settlement in the Americas.

Christopher Columbus ( ) was an Italian explorer from Genoa who led a Spanish maritime expedition to cross the Atlantic Ocean in search of an alternative route to the Far East. Columbus believed he sailed his crew to the East Indies, but Europeans realized years later that his voyages landed them in the New World. His first voyage to the New World was made on the Spanish ships &quot;&quot;Niña&quot;&quot;, &quot;Pinta&quot;, and &quot;Santa María&quot; and took about three months. The crew&#x27;s arrival in the New World initiated the colonization of the Americas by Spain, followed in the ensuing centuries by other European powers, as well as the transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, and technology between the New and Old Worlds, an event referred to by some late 20th‐century historians as the Columbian exchange.

The landing is celebrated as Columbus Day in the United States, but the name varies internationally. In some Latin American countries, October 12 is known as &quot;Día de la Raza&quot; or &quot;Day of the Race&quot;. This was the case for Mexico, until it renamed it to &quot;Day of the Pluricultural Nation&quot;. Some countries such as Spain refer to the holiday as the Day of Hispanicity or &quot;Día de la Hispanidad&quot; and is also Spain&#x27;s National Day or &quot;Fiesta Nacional de España&quot;, where it coincides with the religious festivity of &quot;La Virgen del Pilar&quot;. Since 2009, Peru has celebrated &quot;Día de los pueblos originarios y el diálogo intercultural&quot; (&quot;Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Dialogue Day&quot;). Belize and Uruguay celebrate it as &quot;Pan American Day&quot; and &quot;Día de las Américas&quot; (&quot;Day of the Americas&quot;). The day is also commemorated in Italy, as &quot;Giornata Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo&quot; or &quot;Festa Nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo&quot;, and in the Little Italys around the world.

== American observance ==

=== History ===

The first Columbus Day celebration took place on October 12, 1792, when the Columbian Order of New York, better known as Tammany Hall, held an event to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historic landing. The Columbus Obelisk in Baltimore was erected in 1792.

Many Italian Americans observe Columbus Day as a celebration of their heritage and not of Columbus himself, and the day was celebrated in New York City on October 12, 1866. The day was first enshrined as a legal holiday in the United States through the lobbying of Angelo Noce, a first-generation American, in Denver. The first statewide holiday was proclaimed by Colorado governor Jesse F. McDonald in 1905, and it was made a statutory holiday in 1907. (Colorado replaced Columbus Day with Frances Xavier Cabrini Day in 2020, though that holiday is observed a week earlier.)

For the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyage in 1892, following the lynchings of 11 Italian immigrants by a mob in New Orleans, President Benjamin Harrison declared Columbus Day as a one-time national celebration. The proclamation was part of a wider effort after the lynching incident to placate Italian Americans and ease diplomatic tensions with Italy. During the anniversary in 1892, teachers, preachers, poets, and politicians used rituals to teach ideals of patriotism. These rituals took themes such as citizenship boundaries, the importance of loyalty to the nation, and the celebration of social progress, included among them was the Pledge of Allegiance by Francis Bellamy.
In 1934, as a result of lobbying by the Knights of Columbus and New York City Italian leader Generoso Pope, Congress passed a statute stating: &quot;The President is requested to issue each year a proclamation (1) designating October 12 as Columbus Day; (2) calling on United States government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on Columbus Day; and (3) inviting the people of the United States to observe Columbus Day, in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies that express the public sentiment befitting the anniversary of the discovery of America.&quot; President Franklin Delano Roosevelt responded by making such a proclamation. This proclamation did not lead to the modern federal holiday; it was similar to language regarding Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s birthday and Gold Star Mothers Day. In 1941, some 1,881 Italian Americans were interned and lost rights as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; because of a widely held belief that they would remain loyal to Italy, an Axis power, during World War II. Most all of those interned were citizens of Italy, including Italian students and businessmen residing in the U.S.; the internment did not include the 690,000 Italians who had immigrated to the United States and millions of other Americans of Italian descent. On Columbus Day 1942, Franklin Roosevelt announced the removal of the designation of Italian Americans as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; along with a plan to offer citizenship to 200,000 elderly Italians living in the United States who had been unable to acquire citizenship due to a literacy requirement. However, the implementation of the announcement was not completed until those interned in camps were released following Italy&#x27;s surrender to the Allies on September 8, 1943.

In 1966, Mariano A. Lucca, from Buffalo, New York, founded the National Columbus Day Committee, which lobbied to make Columbus Day a federal holiday. These efforts were successful and legislation to create Columbus Day as a federal holiday was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on June 28, 1968, to be effective beginning in 1971.

Since 1971, when Columbus Day became an officially recognized federal holiday in the United States, it has been observed on the second Monday in October, as commemorated by annual Presidential proclamation noting Columbus&#x27; achievements. It is generally observed by banks, the bond market, the U.S. Postal Service, other federal agencies, most state government offices, many businesses, and most school districts. Some businesses and some stock exchanges remain open, and some states and municipalities abstain from observing the holiday. The traditional date of the holiday also adjoins the anniversary of the United States Navy (founded October 13, 1775), and thus both occasions are customarily observed by the Navy and the Marine Corps with either a 72- or 96-hour liberty period.

The observance on the second Monday in October means it coincides with the Canadian holiday of Thanksgiving.

=== Localization ===
Actual observance varies in different parts of the United States, ranging from large-scale parades and events to complete nonobservance. Most states do not celebrate Columbus Day as an official state holiday. Some mark it as a &quot;Day of Observance&quot; or &quot;Recognition”. Most states that celebrate Columbus Day will close state services, while others operate as normal.

San Francisco claims the nation&#x27;s oldest continuously existing celebration with the Italian-American community&#x27;s annual Columbus Day Parade, which was established by Nicola Larco in 1868, while New York City boasts the largest, with over 35,000 marchers and one million viewers around 2010.

As in the mainland United States, Columbus Day is a legal holiday in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In the United States Virgin Islands, the day is celebrated as both Columbus Day and &quot;Puerto Rico Friendship Day&quot;.

Virginia also celebrates two legal holidays on the day, Columbus Day and Yorktown Victory Day, which honors the final victory at the Siege of Yorktown in the Revolutionary War.

=== Nonobservance ===
Despite Columbus Day being a national holiday and a celebration of Italian heritage, the celebration of Columbus Day in the United States began to decline at the end of the 20th century, although Americans continue to celebrate it. The District of Columbia and the states of Colorado, Hawaii, Alaska, Vermont, South Dakota, New Mexico, Maine, Minnesota, and parts of California, including, for example, Los Angeles County, do not recognize it and have each replaced it with celebrations of Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day (in Hawaii, &quot;Discoverers&#x27; Day&quot;, in South Dakota, &quot;Native American Day&quot;) or other holidays. In the states of Delaware, Oregon and Washington, Columbus Day is not an official holiday.

Iowa and Nevada do not celebrate Columbus Day as an official holiday, but the states&#x27; respective governors are &quot;authorized and requested&quot; by statute to proclaim the day each year. Several states have removed the day as a paid holiday for state government workers, while maintaining it either as a day of recognition, or as a legal holiday for other purposes, including California and Texas.

The practice of U.S. cities eschewing Columbus Day to celebrate Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day began in 1992 with Berkeley, California. The list of cities that have followed suit as of 2018 includes Austin, Boise, Cincinnati, Denver, Los Angeles, Mankato, Philadelphia, Portland, San Francisco, Santa Fe, Seattle, Saint Paul, Phoenix, Tacoma, and &quot;dozens of others&quot;.

Columbus, Ohio, has chosen to honor veterans instead of Christopher Columbus, and removed Columbus Day as a city holiday in 2018. Various tribal governments in Oklahoma designate the day as Native American Day, or name it after their own tribe.

In 2017, the city council of Akron, Ohio, became split along racial lines with the decision to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Day, creating pushback from the city&#x27;s Italian-American community. In 2018, a compromise was reached, with the city council voting to name the first Monday of October as North American First People&#x27;s Day while keeping Columbus Day, and in 2020, Columbus Day was renamed Italian-American Heritage and Culture Day.

== Latin American observance ==
The date Columbus arrived in the Americas is celebrated in some countries of Latin America. The most common name for the celebration in Spanish (including some Latin American communities in the United States) is the &quot;Día de la Raza&quot; (&quot;day of the race&quot; or the &quot;day of the [Hispanic] people&quot;), commemorating the first encounters of Europeans and the Native Americans. The day was first celebrated in Argentina in 1917, in Venezuela and Colombia in 1921, in Chile in 1922, and in Mexico, it was first celebrated in 1928. The day was also celebrated under this title in Spain until 1957, when it was changed to the &quot;Día de la Hispanidad&quot; (&quot;Hispanicity Day&quot;), and in Venezuela, it was celebrated under this title until 2002, when it was changed to the &quot;Día de la Resistencia Indígena&quot; (Day of Indigenous Resistance). Originally conceived of as a celebration of Hispanic influence in the Americas, as evidenced by the complementary celebrations in Spain and Latin America, &quot;Día de la Raza&quot; has come to be seen by nationalist activists throughout Latin America as a counter to Columbus Day – a celebration of the native races and cultures and their resistance to the arrival of Europeans in the Americas.

In the United States, &quot;Día de la Raza&quot; has served as a time of mobilization for panethnic Latino activists, particularly since the 1960s. Since then, La Raza has served as a periodic rallying cry for Hispanic activists. The first Hispanic March on Washington occurred on Columbus Day in 1996. The name was used by the largest Hispanic social justice organization in the nation, UnidosUS, which was known as the National Council of La Raza from 1968 to 2017.

On October 10, 1992, Pope John Paul II visited the Dominican Republic to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Americas and the arrival of Christianity in the &quot;New World&quot;. His visit ended with a mass in the nation&#x27;s cathedral, the first cathedral in the Western Hemisphere.

=== Argentina ===
The Day of the Race was established in Argentina in 1916 by a decree of President Hipólito Yrigoyen. The name was changed to &quot;Day of Respect of Cultural Diversity&quot; by a presidential decree in 2010 issued by President Cristina Kirchner. The statue of Columbus was removed from its original position near the Casa Rosada and replaced by one of Juana Azurduy, a patriot and leader in the struggle for independence who had indigenous ancestors.

=== Colombia ===
Colombia, whose name originated from Columbus himself, celebrates &quot;El día de la Raza y de la Hispanidad&quot; (meaning &quot;Day of the Race and Hispanicity&quot;), and is taken as an opportunity to celebrate the encounter of &quot;the two worlds&quot; and to reflect on the richness that the racial diversity has brought to the culture. In 2021 the Ministry of Culture changed the name of the holiday to ‘Día de la Diversidad Étnica y Cultural de la Nación Colombiana (meaning &quot;Day of Ethnical and Cultural Diversity of the Colombian nation&quot;).

=== Peru ===
In Peru, it was known as &quot;Día del descubrimiento de América&quot; (&quot;Day of the discovery of America&quot;). Since 2009, it has been celebrated as &quot;Día de los pueblos originarios y el diálogo intercultural&quot; (Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Dialogue Day).

=== Venezuela ===
Between 1921 and 2002, Venezuela celebrated &quot;Día de la Raza&quot; along with many other Latin American nations. The original holiday was officially established in 1921 under President Juan Vicente Gómez. In 2002, under President Hugo Chávez, the holiday was changed to &quot;Día de la Resistencia Indígena&quot; (Day of Indigenous Resistance) to commemorate the Indigenous peoples&#x27; resistance to European settlement.

On October 12, 2004, a crowd of progovernment activists toppled a statue of Christopher Columbus by Rafael de la Cova in Caracas. The activists also sprayed allusive graffiti over its pedestal. The walk where the statue had stood was renamed in 2008 &quot;Indigenous Resistance Walk&quot;. Later, a statue of an indigenous leader, Guaicaipuro, was erected on the plinth.

=== Costa Rica ===
On September 21, 1994, Costa Rica changed the official holiday from &quot;Día de la Raza&quot; to &quot;Día del Encuentro de las Culturas&quot; (Day of the Encounter of Cultures) to recognize the mix of European, Native American (autochthonous populations), African and Asian cultures that constitute modern Costa Rican (and Latin American) culture and ethnicity. In accordance to the Costa Rican labor law, the holiday is observed on October 12. Should this date coincide with a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, the employer shall agree that said holiday be postponed to the following Monday. In 2020, Costa Ricans eliminated this holiday, which was under debate in years prior. Hence, in exchange Costa Rica now celebrates the &#x27;Military Abolition Day&#x27; on December 1.

=== El Salvador ===
In June 1915, the official holiday of &#x27;&quot;Fiesta de la Raza&quot;&#x27; was established, with October 12 being the date of the national holiday. Presently, since October 12, 2021, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador abolished the previous national &quot;Fiesta de la Raza&quot; holiday, &quot; [to] vindicate the origin and identity of indigenous peoples who were forgotten by previous governments, who for decades celebrated Race Day as a positive event and who never adopted mechanisms to enhance human rights&quot;. The holiday is no longer celebrated officially.

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico, the date was known as Columbus Day or Day of the Race. On December 18, 2020, by decree of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the name of October 12 was changed to &quot;Day of the Pluricultural Nation&quot;. The statue of Columbus along Mexico City&#x27;s Paseo de la Reforma was removed and replaced with a replica of &quot;The Young Woman of Amajac&quot;, a sculpture depicting an Indigenous woman.

== Caribbean observance ==
Only a handful of Caribbean countries observe holidays related to Columbus Day. In Belize, October 12 is celebrated as Day of the Americas or Pan American Day. In the Bahamas, it was formerly known as Discovery Day, until 2001 when it was replaced by National Heroes Day. In 1937, Cuban President Federico Laredo Brú (1936–1940) spoke to the nation and countries of America in Cuba on October 12 commemorating Christopher Columbus&#x27;s voyage to the New World. Federico Laredo Brú spoke about Columbus&#x27;s impact on the land and the future of its settlement. He ended his speech with venerating Christopher Columbus&#x27;s efforts to colonize and establish settlements along the new front and the pride of one&#x27;s nation. He added &quot;&quot;Por mi raza hablo mi espiritu&quot;,&quot; which translates to &quot;For my race my spirit called,&quot; to support the political infrastructure at the time.

=== Columbus&#x27;s legacy ===

In December 1937, Cuban president Federico Laredo Brú and Dominican Republic president Rafael Trujillo ordered a crew of aviators to travel through Latin America collecting funds from large capital cities for a monumental light house in the Dominican Republic. The exploration &quot;Escuadrilla Binacional Pro Faro de Colón&quot; was inspired by Columbus&#x27;s journey across the North Atlantic Ocean to America. The expedition consisted of three Stinson Reliant SR-9s borrowed from the Cuban Air Force – named &quot;Santa María&quot;, &quot;Niña&quot; and &quot;Pinta&quot; after the vessels commanded by Columbus – and a Curtiss Wright CW-19R from the Dominican military aviation named &quot;Colon&quot; after Columbus. On December 15, after visiting a majority of South America, their flight to the Peruvian capital Lima was hampered by an unexpected sandstorm. Two planes (&quot;Colon&quot; and &quot;La Pinta&quot;) were forced to land in Pisco and &quot;Niña&quot; disappeared in the storm. The &quot;Santa Maria&quot; was the only plane to reach Lima as planned, landing at Las Palmas on the day of the storm. After extensive searches, &quot;Niña&quot; radioed their whereabouts after their radio was damaged in the storm. The aircraft restrategized in Las Palmas, and on December 29 their expedition took off from El Techo airport in Bogotá en route to El Guabito airport in Cali. Later that day, the crew flew into an unexpected storm over the Valley of Cauca. With minimal visibility and poor navigation, &quot;Niña&quot;, &quot;La Pinta&quot;, and &quot;Santa Maria&quot; crashed into high mountains, while &quot;Colon&quot;, unaware of the other aircraft, flew over the storm and safely made it to Panama City. The plane is preserved today as remembrance of the bravery of the crew and Christopher Columbus&#x27;s journey.

In 1992, in remembrance of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America, the Columbus Lighthouse, in Santo Domingo Este was inaugurated. The monument is both a mausoleum and a museum showcasing objects including a boat from Cuba and Colombian jewelry. Constructed of concrete, the monument is long. Its architecture is cross-shaped and represents the Christianization of the Americas. According to Dominican authorities, Columbus&#x27; remains are sheltered at the lighthouse. Spanish authorities proved through DNA tests that remains in the Cathedral of Seville were his and Dominican authorities have not allowed the same, so whether the sets are related remains unknown.

==European observance==
=== Italy ===
Since the 18th century, many Italian communities in the Americas have observed the Discovery of the New World as a celebration of their heritage, since Columbus was born in Republic of Genoa, nowadays Italy. In Italy, Columbus Day has been officially celebrated since 2004. It is officially named &quot;Giornata nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo&quot; (&quot;National Christopher Columbus Day&quot;).

The Christopher Columbus House in Genoa, Italy, is an 18th-century reconstruction of the house in which Christopher Columbus grew up. The house is located outside Genoa&#x27;s 14th-century walls. During the Renaissance, the area became subject to intense building, mainly consisting of public housing. Columbus was born in 1451, and historical documents indicated that Columbus lived here between approximately 1455 and 1470. At this time, the house had two or maybe three stories, with a shop on the ground floor, and the front door to the left of the shop.

The &quot;Lega Navale Italiana&quot; has created a &quot;Regata di Colombo&quot; (&quot;Columbus Regatta&quot;) as a celebration of the Columbus achievement. Italians have celebrated Christopher Columbus ( ) naming after him many civilian and military ships, like the training ship SS &quot;Cristoforo Colombo&quot; and the ocean liner SS &quot;Cristoforo Colombo&quot;.

=== Spain ===
The first celebration of the Discovery of the Américas by Columbus in Spain was as early as 1642 when the city of Zaragoza designated the Virgen del Pilar (Our Lady of the Pillar) as symbol of the Hispanidad (Hispanicity) on the date of the Spanish expedition&#x27;s arrival to the New World. This holiday was declared a religious feast day throughout the Spanish Empire in 1730.
In 1892, the 12 of October was declared a one-time national day in commemoration of the 4th centenary of the Discovery of America and the perpetuation of the festivity was then first considered. The Spanish government suggested other nations (Hispanic American countries, Italy and the United States of America) to join the celebration, which was followed with enthusiasm by them, with a few exceptions.
The Discovery of America and the Hispanicity has been celebrated as a national day since 1918 under different names like &quot;Día de la Hispanidad&quot; or &quot;Dia de la Raza&quot;, due to changes of political regimes in the 20th century. The national day emphasises Spain&#x27;s ties with the &quot;Hispanidad&quot;, the international Hispanic community and Spanish legacy to the world. In 1981 a royal decree established the &quot;Fiesta Nacional y Día de la Hispanidad&quot; as a national holiday. In 1987 the name was changed again to &quot;Fiesta Nacional&quot; and October 12 became one of two national celebrations, along with Constitution Day on December 6, as part of a compromise between conservatives, who wanted to emphasize the status of the monarchy and Spain&#x27;s history, and Republicans, who wanted to commemorate Spain&#x27;s burgeoning democracy with an official holiday. Since 2000, October 12 has also been Spain&#x27;s Day of the Armed Forces, celebrated each year with a military parade in Madrid. The holiday is widely celebrated in Spain with official and cultural events throughout the country. Shops and businesses are closed as with other bank holidays. The observation is enhanced with the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar (Fiestas del Pilar), the so-called Mother of &quot;Hispanidad&quot;, and of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Extremadura (Santa María de Guadalupe) (appointed Queen of Hispanicity in 1928 by the Vatican) from Guadalupe, Caceres, whose Monastery was the venue in June 1492 for the decisive meeting between the Catholic Monarchs and Columbus to start organizing the travel and where the latter came back in 1493, right after returning from his first voyage, to thank &quot;Her&quot; for his success.

== Opposition ==

For years after the first Columbus Day celebration in 1892, opposition to Columbus Day recognized the suffering inflicted on American Indians with westward expansion.

It also originated from anti-immigrant nativist Know Nothing political movement, who sought to eliminate its celebration because of its association with immigrants from the Catholic countries of Ireland and Italy, and the American Catholic fraternal organization, the Knights of Columbus. Some anti-Catholics, notably including the Ku Klux Klan and the Women of the Ku Klux Klan, opposed celebrations of Columbus or monuments about him because they thought that it increased Catholic influence in the United States, which was largely a Protestant country.

In the summer of 1990, 350 representatives from American Indian groups from all over the hemisphere met in Quito, Ecuador, at the first Intercontinental Gathering of Indigenous People in the Americas, to mobilize against the 500th anniversary (quin-centennial) celebration of Columbus Day planned for 1992. The following summer, in Davis, California, more than a hundred Native Americans gathered for a follow-up meeting to the Quito conference. They declared October 12, 1992, to be &quot;International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People&quot;.

More recently, mainly since the 1990s, more people oppose Columbus&#x27;s and other Europeans&#x27; actions against the indigenous populations of the Americas. This opposition was initially led by Native Americans and was expanded upon by left-wing political parties. Various holidays commemorating Columbus have now been abolished, with various Latin American countries altering the holidays to now recognise indigenous populations.
There are many interrelated strands of criticism. One refers primarily to the treatment of the indigenous populations during the European colonization of the Americas, which followed Columbus&#x27;s discovery. Some groups, such as the American Indian Movement, have argued that the ongoing actions and injustices against Native Americans are masked by Columbus myths and celebrations. American anthropologist Jack Weatherford says that on Columbus Day, Americans celebrate the greatest waves of genocide of the American Indians known in history.

A second strain of criticism of Columbus Day focuses on the character of Columbus himself. In time for the 2004 observation of the day, the final volume of a compendium of Columbus-era documents was published by the University of California, Los Angeles&#x27; Medieval and Renaissance Center. It stated that Columbus, while a brilliant mariner, exploited and enslaved the indigenous population.

Spelman College historian Howard Zinn described some of the details in his book, &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;, of how Columbus personally ordered the enslavement and mutilation of the native Arawak people in a bid to repay his investors.

Journalist and media critic Norman Solomon reflects, in &quot;Columbus Day: A Clash of Myth and History&quot;, that many people choose to hold on to the myths instead of reality in the events surrounding Columbus. He disputes the idea that the Spaniards&#x27; arrival was beneficial towards the Indians by quoting &quot;History of the Indies&quot; by the Catholic priest Bartolomé de las Casas, who observed the region where Columbus was governor. Las Casas writes that the Spaniards were driven by &quot;insatiable greed&quot; as they killed and tortured native populations with &quot;the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty&quot; and laments that &quot;my eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write&quot;. This view seems to be selective as he largely ignores the Laws of Burgos of 1512 or the New Laws of 1542.

<text>Starbuck is a city in Pope County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,365 at the 2020 census. The city is on the western shore of Lake Minnewaska.

==Geography==
Minnesota State Highways 28, 29, and 114 are three of Starbuck&#x27;s main routes.

==History==
Starbuck was platted in the spring of 1882, as a village on the Northern Pacific railway, adjoining Lake Minnewaska. The growth and settlement of Pope County were greatly impeded for many years by the lack of railway and shipping facilities, which obliged settlers to go long distances into adjoining counties to market their products.

The town was reportedly named after Stabekk in Bærum in Akershus county, Norway. But &quot;Geographical Names of Manitoba&quot; says the village of Starbuck, Manitoba, is thought to have been named after the town in Minnesota by a contractor working for the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, and that Starbuck, Minnesota, was named after William H. Starbuck of New York, who financed the Little Falls and Dakota Railroad. Some also believe the town&#x27;s name comes from the oxen used to build the railroad through the town, whose names were Star and Buck.

<text>A lakh (; abbreviated L; sometimes written lac) is a unit in the Indian numbering system equal to one hundred thousand (100,000; scientific notation: 105). In the Indian 2, 2, 3 convention of digit grouping, it is written as 1,00,000. For example, in India, 150,000 rupees becomes 1.5 &quot;lakh&quot; rupees, written as 1,50,000 or INR 1,50,000.

It is widely used both in official and other contexts in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It is often used in Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan English.

==Usage==
In Indian English, the word is used both as an attributive and non-attributive noun with either an unmarked or marked (&quot;-s&quot;) plural, respectively. For example: &quot;1 &quot;lakh&quot; people&quot;; &quot;&quot;lakhs&quot; of people&quot;; &quot;20 &quot;lakh&quot; rupees&quot;; &quot;&quot;lakhs&quot; of rupees&quot;. In the abbreviated form, usage such as &quot;5L&quot; or &quot;5 lac&quot; (for &quot;5 &quot;lakh&quot; rupees&quot;) is common. In this system of numeration, 100 &quot;lakh&quot; is called one &quot;crore&quot; and is equal to 10 million.

Formal written publications in English in India tend to use lakh/crore for Indian currency and Western numbering for foreign currencies, such as dollars and pounds.

===Silver market===
The term is also used in the pricing of silver on the international precious metals market, where one &quot;lakh&quot; equals of silver.

==Etymology and regional variants==
The modern word &quot;lakh&quot; derives from , originally denoting &quot;mark, target, stake in gambling&quot;, but also used as the numeral for &quot;100,000&quot; in Gupta-era Classical Sanskrit (&quot;Yājñavalkya Smṛti&quot;, &quot;Harivaṃśa&quot;).

==History==
In 1844, French Canadian settler Benjamin Gervais moved north from Saint Paul to claim land in order to build the first grist mill in Minnesota that was independent from the government. The large lake on the east side of Little Canada bears his name (Lake Gervais). The grist mill was converted into a park, which is recognized as the birthplace of the city. Little Canada began as the township of New Canada in 1858. In the 1950s, the township was threatened by the suburban sprawl of the ensuing larger communities that were formed, such as Maplewood. In 1953, the city leaders came together and established the village of Little Canada. It became a city in 1974.

<text>New Brighton ( ) is a city in Ramsey County, Minnesota, United States. It is a suburb of the Twin Cities. The population was 23,454 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In the mid 18th century, Mdewakanton Dakota tribes lived in the vicinity of New Brighton&#x27;s marshy lakes, harvesting wild rice. The Dakota eventually settled a village near Long Lake at Rice Creek and a smaller encampment just east of Silver Lake Road on 3rd Street NW. Immigrants from Britain and France settled a small village in 1858 that included a general store, a school, and a mission church. As railroads were established in the area, millers in Minneapolis formed the Minneapolis Stockyards and Packing Company in 1888. The company supplied home, agriculture, and business needs. The venture included Minneapolis figures such as streetcar magnate Thomas Lowry, flour millers John Sargent Pillsbury, Senator William D. Washburn, ex-Minneapolis Mayor W.H. Eustis, and industrialist W.H. Dunwoody. As the village grew in prominence, it was incorporated on January 20, 1891. The city was given the name New Brighton after Brighton, Massachusetts. The founding population was primarily English-American. Each August, a city festival, Stockyard Days, celebrates this heritage at Long Lake Park.

As the streetcar system expanded in the early 20th century, immigrant and first-generation groups from Eastern Europe and Germany began moving outward from Northeast Minneapolis. New Brighton and St. Anthony residents also continue to celebrate this ethnic heritage with an annual &quot;Polka Dance Party&quot; which began in 1892.

In the 1920s, a local farmer said he heard a rumor that bootleggers had buried gold bars along Long Lake&#x27;s eastern shore. The rumor spread and launched a mini &quot;gold rush&quot; along Long Lake to find the treasure.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. Rice Creek flows through the northern part of the city.

New Brighton is at the intersection of Interstate Highways 35W and 694. It is geographically incongruent. From north to south it is not even, and east to west it is even in only a few places. A piece of the city sits on the east side of Interstate 35W isolated from the rest of the city.

Nearby places include Arden Hills, Shoreview, Roseville, Saint Anthony Village, Columbia Heights, Fridley, Mounds View, and Minneapolis.

New Brighton is part of east–central Minnesota&#x27;s glacial plain sandpile, which was flattened by glaciers during the most recent glacial advance. During the last glacial period, massive ice sheets at least thick ravaged the landscape of the town and sculpted its current terrain, which can be easily seen in Long Lake Regional Park. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. Since New Brighton&#x27;s landscape is still recovering from the weight of the glaciers and going through post-glacial rebound and the turmoil this created, the landscape is poorly drained, which has created the numerous lakes and rivers in the city. Long Lake itself is the remnants of the glaciers, as it was a chunk of ice that was left behind, melted, and created the lake in the hole it occupied.

<text>North Oaks is an exurban city north of St. Paul in Ramsey County in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The population was 4,469 at the 2010 census.

Formerly a gated community that now posts private access signage, all land is owned by homeowners with the North Oaks Home Owners Association maintaining all roads, plowing, parks, facilities, and recreation trails. Each homeowner&#x27;s property extends halfway into the street. There is also a city government with a Mayor and City Council that administers basic services such as fire, police, planning, and licensing. The city owns no property.

==History==
Structured around Pleasant Lake, the area began as a water source for the Saint Paul municipal water system, which still maintains water access rights today. The land was later purchased by Saint Paul magnate James J. Hill in 1883 and expanded into a breeding and hobby farm.

His son Louis Hill later owned North Oaks Farm until death in 1950. Ownership passed to Louis&#x27; children who decided to develop the land into a model residential community. They incorporated the North Oaks Company with a mission to build with respect for the natural environment, having witnessed metropolitan sprawl during this time. To ensure their mission would be fulfilled, land was subdivided and sold with a warranty deed that created the North Oaks Home Owners’ Association (NOHOA) to be responsible for roads and recreation. Each deed placed each home&#x27;s property line halfway into the street, placing all roads into private ownership.

Remaining land in the city is owned by the North Oaks Company. The original farm buildings have been restored with informational displays. They are not open to the public however as North Oaks is private. Two of the remaining structures, the Blacksmith Shop and Machine Shop and Dairy Building, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In May 2008, NOHOA sent a letter to internet search company Google, stating that its Street View software contained images that violated their trespassing ordinance, and requested their removal. Google complied, so there is no street view available for the roads within North Oaks.

<text>North Saint Paul (abbreviated North St. Paul) is a city in Ramsey County, Minnesota, United States, located east-northeast of the city of Saint Paul. The population was 12,364 at the 2020 census.

North Saint Paul is a distinct city, and not a neighborhood of nearby Saint Paul. This fact also contributes to a major difference from typical suburbs; rather than being composed of new developments and urban sprawl, many of the structures in town are older, including a downtown area of brick storefronts.

On the east side of the Margaret Street bridge over Minnesota State Highway 36 resides the 20-ton &quot;North Saint Paul Snowman&quot;. As the official city logo of North Saint Paul, it was constructed on Margaret and 7th Streets from 1971 to 1974 by Lloyd Koesling and moved to its current location in 1990.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Silver Lake and Casey Lake are the city&#x27;s largest bodies of water and both have large, adjacent parks.

==Transportation==
Minnesota Highway 36 and the Gateway State Trail, running over the former Soo Line Railway grade, bisect the city of North Saint Paul.

Highway 36 serves as a main route in the city; it is a four-lane highway with both at-grade and overpass intersections. Additionally, Interstate Highway 694 is in close proximity to the city.

==History==
North St. Paul was originally called Castle, and under the latter name was laid out in 1887 by Henry Anson Castle when the Wisconsin Central Railroad was extended to that point.

North St. Paul boasts the oldest continuously operating bar in Minnesota, Neumann&#x27;s Bar, in their historic downtown area. The original bar opened for business in 1887, and has continuously operated as an establishment serving alcoholic beverages ever since. Even during Prohibition, they served near beer in the main bar, and opened a speakeasy upstairs. Visitors can still go upstairs and see the keyhole door used to screen entrants, and the old telephone that was connected to the downstairs bar so that messages could be passed back and forth.

<text>Roseville is a city in Ramsey County, Minnesota, United States. It is one of two Twin Cities suburbs that are bordered directly by Saint Paul and Minneapolis (Lauderdale being the other suburb). Roseville comprises Falcon Heights, Lauderdale, and southern Roseville. The latter was unincorporated until Roseville incorporated in 1948, and Falcon Heights and Lauderdale incorporated in 1949. The population was 36,254 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Roseville&#x27;s land was originally settled by the Dakota and Ojibwe peoples. The first white settlers came in 1843, and the Native Americans left the area by 1862. Rose Township was established in 1858; it was named after one of the first settlers, Isaac Rose. The township included the areas now known as Roseville, Lauderdale, and Falcon Heights, as well as parts of present-day Saint Paul and Minneapolis. When it was first organized, Rose Township&#x27;s western boundary was what is now Stinson Boulevard in Minneapolis, and its southern boundary was what is now Marshall Avenue until Dale Street, where it turned north until University Avenue (then called Minnehaha Avenue), where it turned east until it met Rice Street. Continued expansion by Saint Paul and county boundary adjustments with Hennepin County reduced its size over time.

In the 1870s and 1880s, until Saint Paul expanded to its current size, there was a small settlement labeled on maps as Roseville. It was next to a farmstead owned by Jacob F. True, president of the Ramsey County Agricultural Society. Four large blocks were laid out in a shape of a parallelogram from the northwest corner of Saint Anthony Avenue and Snelling Avenue. Two roads ran through it, College Street (now Pierce Street) and Fry Street, and its northern road was essentially Shields Avenue. Its platting affected future developments, causing streets to be laid at an irregular distance from surrounding neighborhoods all the way down to Summit Avenue, between Pierce Street (then Webb Street where it met Summit) and Snelling Avenue, which can still be seen today.

The area saw rapid growth through the 1930s and 1940s, and Roseville incorporated as a village in 1948 to accommodate it. Falcon Heights and Lauderdale soon followed suit, and Rose Township ceased to exist. The first Roseville police chief was Ray Goneau, who held that position until 1977.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

==History==
Brooks was established in 1904 as a station on the Soo Line Railroad. By 1926, Brooks had two general stores, a grocery store, a bank, hardware store, butcher shop, blacksmith shop, a livery barn, two saloons, a community hall and a hotel to accommodate travelers. Brooks was primarily a service town for the surrounding agricultural townships, and a creamery was established as the local dairying business developed on neighboring farms. After the invention of the cream separator, family farms in adjoining townships of Polk and Red Lake counties switched from subsistence agriculture to a market economy and became a part of the dairy industry.

===Brooks Cheese Company===
In 1926, the Brooks creamery was purchased by the owners of the cheese factory in nearby Terrebonne, who moved their operation to Brooks. The business was widely known as the Brooks Cheese Company. It was a cheese factory owned by the Parenteau family, which sold its product to the Kraft Foods company, and marketed its products throughout the Midwest. Local farmers would process the milk from their own cows by removing the butterfat or cream, which was hauled in cream cans to the cheese factory, while the skim milk or whey was fed to hogs raised on the same farm. The Brooks Cheese Company continued in business until the late 1970s, at which point the decline of the family farm and the predominance of monoculture and industrial agriculture eliminated the mixed agriculture that formerly had predominated in the area of Brooks.

Although the local history of Red Lake County blames the National Farmers Organization for organizing farmers to cooperative actions in withholding milk shipments, the reality is that Brooks Cheese Company could not compete with the major industrial cheese manufacturers and the development of agribusiness which portended the demise of the family farm. By the beginning of the 21st century, few dairy cows could be found within twenty miles of Brooks, whereas at one time virtually every quarter section could be counted on for the cream produced by 10 or 15 cows. Nonetheless, Brooks continues to be the site of an agricultural supply business, a gas station, and several other local businesses, as well as one church.
