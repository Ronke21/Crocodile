<text>Nashville is a village in Barry County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,537 at the 2020 census. The township exists largely within Castleton Township, with a small portion extending south into Maple Grove Township.

==History==

The initial plat for Nashville was on land originally purchased by John R. Pettibone on February 15, 1836. The land was part of Barry Township and then Hastings Township until February 16, 1842, when the land became Section 36 of the newly formed Castleton Township. By 1865, Robert B. Gregg owned the land and platted 127 lots on the south side of the Thornapple River. The survey was done by Joshua Martin and certified on October 2, 1865. Gregg&#x27;s first lot sale was to Enos Kuhlman. By 1875, seven additions had been made to the original plat.

In 1852, Henry Feighner and his brother Solomon arrived from Ohio seeking to buy land. In addition to purchased from Horace Butler, Henry bought the property of Hiram Hanchett, including Hanchett’s sawmill located on the west side of the Thornapple. Solomon managed the sawmill until Henry sold the property to Phillip Holler in about 1865.

In 1867, across the river from Holler&#x27;s sawmill, a gristmill was built by Eli and M. V. B. Mallett, and G. W. Johnson. Holler bought the new gristmill from the Mallett&#x27;s and Johnson in 1868. Holler continued to use the original sawmill as a feedmill.

Some time after 1869, probably 1873–1874, Griffith and Grant built a grain elevator alongside the new Grand River Valley Division of the Michigan Central Railroad. In 1874 Ainsworth and Brooks bought the elevator and 3 years later added a steam powered feedmill. It was at that time that Holler initiated a new patent process for making flour. Holler&#x27;s mill became known as the Nashville Roller Mills. And by 1916, when Louis Lass and son Otto bought the mill, flour was sold as Red-eye Flour.

Until 1869 the community had remained nameless. In 1866 the chief engineer for the Grand River Valley Railroad began a survey for a route from Jackson to Grand Rapids. Garaudus Nash suggested that his name be used. Without objection, the community was named Nashville. On March 26, 1869, Michigan governor Henry Baldwin signed into law the incorporation of the Village of Nashville.

Commencing in 1920 Nashville was used as the half-way stopping point between the Jackson and Grand Rapids railroad terminals. It took the trains one day (the trains did not travel at night) to reach Nashville from either the Jackson or Grand Rapids terminals. Prior to 1920 trains had stopped in Hastings overnight. These &quot;stop-overs&quot; required a hostler to tend the locomotives while the train crew spent the night in town. In 1920 Nashville became the stop-over point and the hostler&#x27;s job was moved to Nashville.

<text>Bay City is a city in and the county seat of Bay County, Michigan, United States. The population was 32,661 as of the 2020 census. The city is located just upriver from the Saginaw Bay on the Saginaw River. It is the principal city of the Bay City metropolitan area, which is coterminous with Bay County as part of the larger Greater Tri-Cities region of Central Michigan. Several historic bridges cross the Saginaw River in Bay City, including Liberty Bridge, Veterans Memorial Bridge, Independence Bridge, and Lafayette Avenue Bridge.

==History==
Leon Tromblé is regarded as the first settler within the limits of Bay County, in an area which would become Bay City. In 1831, he built a log cabin on the east bank of the Saginaw river.
Bay City was first established in 1837 and was incorporated as a city in 1865. In 1834 John B. Trudell built a log-cabin near the present corner of Seventeenth and Broadway. Trudell later purchased land that extended from his residence north along the river to what later became the location for the Industrial Brownhoist, making him the first permanent resident of what has become Bay County. Bay City became the largest community in the county and the location of the county seat of government. Most of the county&#x27;s agencies and associations are located here. The city shares common borders with Essexville and the townships of Bangor, Frankenlust, Hampton, Merritt, Monitor, and Portsmouth.

Bay City was originally known as &quot;Lower Saginaw,&quot; and fell within the boundaries of Saginaw County. On June 4, 1846, the Hapton, or Hampton, Post Office opened to service Lower Saginaw. The community was placed in Bay County, when the county was organized in 1857. It was at this time that the name was changed to Bay City. The Post Office changed its name to Bay City on March 22, 1858.

While Saginaw had the first non-native settlement in this area in 1819, larger ships had difficulty navigating the shallower water near the Saginaw settlement. Many of the early pioneers moved to Lower Saginaw as it became clear its deeper waters made it a better location for the growth of industry which relied on shipping. By 1860, Lower Saginaw had become a bustling community of about 2,000 people with several mills and many small businesses in operation. In 1865, the village of Bay City was incorporated as a city. Rapid economic growth took place during this time period, with lumbering, milling, and shipbuilding creating many jobs. The early industrialists in the area used the Saginaw River as a convenient means to float lumber to the mills and factories and as a consequence amass large fortunes. Many of the mansions built during this era are registered as historical landmarks by the state and federal government.

In 1873, Charles C. Fitzhugh, Jr., a Bay City pioneer, and his wife, Jane, purchased land and built a home on property bounded by Washington, Saginaw, Ninth and Tenth Streets, which later became the location for City Hall. Fitzhugh dealt on a large scale in wild lands and farms, being an agent for over of land in Bay County. During this time, Washington Avenue was primarily developed with residential homes. Businesses were concentrated along Water Street near the Saginaw River. As time went on, businesses started to expand along Washington Avenue. In 1891, the Fitzhughs sold the land to the City of Bay City for $8,500 &quot;to be used for the erection of a City Hall and offices and for no other purposes whatever.&quot;

Until 1905, the City of Bay City was limited to the east bank of the Saginaw River. when West Bay City was annexed.

During the latter half of the 19th century, Bay City was the home of several now-closed industries including many sawmills and shipyards. The Defoe Shipbuilding Company, which ceased operations December 31, 1975, built destroyer escorts, guided missile destroyers, and patrol craft for the United States Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. To maintain this strong Naval heritage, the Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum worked through the Naval Sea Systems Command to bring the USS Edson (DD-946) to Bay City as a museum ship. It was finally delivered to its temporary home in Essexville, Michigan, on August 7, 2012. Another important part of the city&#x27;s industrial history is Industrial Brownhoist, which was well known for its construction of large industrial cranes.

At the outbreak of the First World War, Bay City contained a largely German neighborhood called Salzburg. The German-descended minority became the focus of extreme nativism and xenophobia. Pastors introduced English-language sermons for the first time in Salzburg but it did not catch on and sermons in Salzburg remained mostly German. The Salzburghers demanded that the rest of Bay City recognize them as Americans first and German-American second but hostility towards them continued.
 The governor of Michigan at the time, Albert Sleeper, sought support from the German-American community but experienced backlash. Even before the declaration of war against Germany, anti-German sentiment was so strong that hundreds of young men from Michigan had gone across the border to Canada to join the Canadian Armed Forces so as to be a part of the war effort.

===Notable events===
On December 23, 1906, Bay City&#x27;s premier hotel, the Fraser House, burned to the ground.

Bay City&#x27;s unusual Third Street Bridge was damaged by a freighter on June 17, 1976. The following morning, when the swing span was operated, one half crashed into the Saginaw River blocking all riverine traffic. A river crossing was never reinstated at that location.

On December 10, 1977, a deadly fire claimed the lives of 10 at the Wenonah Hotel (Wenonah Park Apartments) in downtown Bay City. The hotel had been built on the site of the Fraser House, which had also succumbed to a fiery end. The Wenonah Hotel was located at the corner of Center Ave and Water Street, the current site of the Delta College Planetarium. Built in 1907, the four-storey Wenonah Hotel had been converted into apartments at the time of the fire. Strong winds and cold weather hampered the efforts of the fire department. There was some controversy over the cause of the fire (arson, electrical, or grease fire) and it remains the deadliest fire in Bay County history.

On Christmas Eve, 1979, a large Bay City department store of long standing, Oppenheim&#x27;s, was destroyed by fire.

In September 1990, the tankship MV &quot;Jupiter&quot; was unloading gasoline at the Total Petroleum Terminal. A passing cargo ship, , moving at excessive speed, created a wake that caused &quot;Jupiter&quot; to break free of its berth. A fire and explosion ensued, and one man drowned. There was considerable legal action taken, ultimately resulting in an adjudication that was subsequently appealed by the owners of &quot;Buffalo&quot;. The findings of the Court of Appeals upheld the original decision, which assigned 50% of the responsibility to &quot;Buffalo&quot; (for her excessive speed), 25% to the dock operator (for rotten wood pilings) and 25% to &quot;Jupiter&quot; (for improper procedures in unloading her cargo).

In January 2009, Bay City&#x27;s wholly owned municipal power company, Bay City Electric Light and Power, installed a &quot;limiter&quot; device to restrict the receipt of power to the home of Marvin Schur, a 93-year-old customer who had failed to pay an outstanding bill in excess of $1,000. The Bay City Electric Light and Power policy was to install the limiter, and to notify the customer by trying to collect the amount due. City employees failed to knock on the door, and it was later found that Schur had a check already made out and had failed to mail it. Schur died from hypothermia in his home a few days later. The day following his death, Bay City Electric Light and Power removed the limiters from all households. It was later learned that Schur had willed his estate, estimated by his family to be in excess of $500,000, to Bay Regional Medical Center.

On October 12, 2010, the historic 113-year-old City Hall sustained significant damage as the result of an attic fire which caused the sprinkler system to run for nearly two hours. Most of the damage to the building was water damage from the sprinkler system and water used to fight the fire. The fire started in the midst of a $1.6 million roofing project. After an investigation, it was determined that a worker was using a grinder to cut off bolts in the area where the fire started, and sparks from the work started the blaze. Fire crews were on the scene for nearly five hours fighting the hard-to-access fire.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Despite declining population, Bay City remains (by a narrow margin over Port Huron) as the largest U.S. city by population on or near Lake Huron, much smaller than the largest cities on the other four Great Lakes: (Chicago, Toronto, Cleveland, and Thunder Bay).

Bay City, along with Saginaw, and Midland make up the Tri-Cities Area, a sub-region of Flint/Tri-Cities. Bay City is sometimes regarded as being part of the greater Thumb of Michigan Area, which is also a sub-region of the Flint/Tri-Cities.

===Transportation===
====Major highways====

*
*: This short freeway was once a segment of US 23. It is now a connector freeway between I-75 and M-13.
*

====Bridges====
Four modern bascule bridges allow transportation across the Saginaw River, which separates the East and West sides of Bay City. Lafayette Avenue Bridge, opened in 1938, carries M-13 and M-84 over the river. The Veterans Memorial Bridge, opened in 1957, carries M-25 over the river. Independence Bridge, opened in 1976, carries Truman Parkway over the river, replacing the earlier Belinda Street Bridge (built in 1893). Liberty Bridge, opened in 1990, connects Vermont Street (on the west side of the river) and Woodside Avenue (on the east side).

In December 2019, the Bay City commission approved the sale of the Independence and Liberty bridges (The two bridges owned by the city, the other two being owned by the State of Michigan) to United Bridge Partners, a private company, for a total of $5 million. The sale occurred after city officials failed to reach an agreement with the Bay County or State governments concerning a sale or grant for repairs. Bay City Bridge Partners, a subsidiary of United Bridge Partners, was created to repair, refit, and administer the bridges. However, in April 2021 the City and Bay City Bridge Partners agreed to a lease based model instead of an outright sale. Construction started in December 2021 and Liberty Bridge was reopened in December 2022, with Independence bridge expected to reopen in late 2023. Tolling started on June 16, 2023, for Liberty Bridge. Many residents have expressed complaints about the sale and tolling of the bridges, citing a lack of transparency and willingness to work with other branches of government from the city.

==In popular culture==
The Bay City Rollers, a Scottish band, were named after this city after the band randomly threw a dart at a map.

The singer Madonna, who was born in Bay City, referred to her birthplace as &quot;a little, smelly town in Northern Michigan&quot; for which she has had great affection on national television. Mike Buda, former Mayor in the 1990s, commented: &quot;Madonna was absolutely right&quot;, explaining that air pollution from the gas refinery and a neighboring beet sugar plant was in fact so bad that the EPA forced the industries involved to pay a cash settlement to families, like those of Madonna&#x27;s grandmother Elsie Fortin, with homes in the Banks neighborhood.

The story of Bay City&#x27;s refusal to have a commemoration sign about the singer was described in a book &quot;Madonnaland&quot; (2016) by Alina Simone. The sign was subsequently posted in 2022 near her birthplace, the former Mercy Hospital, now known as Bradley House.

<text>Blaine Township is a civil township of Benzie County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 484. It is located in the southwest portion of the county. There are no significant population centers in the township; the nearest towns are Arcadia to the south, Benzonia to the northeast, and Elberta to the northwest. M-22 is the township&#x27;s main thoroughfare.

==History==
Blaine Township was organized from part of what had been Gilmore Township in 1876.

For a very brief period in the early 1890s, a town called Watervale was inhabited in the township along Lower Herring Lake. The town participated in the sawmill boom that brought a period of prosperity to northern Michigan. Abandoned in 1894, the town was made into a summer resort in 1917. Today the resort is known as the Inn at Watervale and the Watervale Historic District. Watervale maintains its nineteenth-century atmosphere and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.70%, is water. It is bordered on the north by Gilmore Township, on the east by Joyfield Township, on the south by Arcadia and Pleasanton townships in Manistee County, and on the west by Lake Michigan. Besides Lake Michigan, the township&#x27;s most distinguishing physical features are Lower and Upper Herring Lakes, connected and fed by Herring Creek, and bluffs at Green Point Dunes (north of the lakes) and Arcadia Dunes.

The township&#x27;s economy is heavily agricultural, with apples and cherries two prominent crops. Fruit orchards dominate much of the landscape.

==Sites of interest==
Blaine Township is home to two churches, Herring Lake Church (nondenominational) and Blaine Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). A gravity hill located at the site of Blaine Christian Church on Putney Road near its intersection with Joyfield Road is a well-known local landmark.

Since 1991 the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy had maintained a nature preserve along Upper Herring Lake (the Upper Herring Nature Preserve). Just north of the township&#x27;s southern border is Inspiration Point, a high headland overlooking Lake Michigan where a platform has been built atop the bluff. The point is a popular lookout and is a prominent stop along the scenic route of Highway 22. The Conservancy also maintains popular and scenic preserves at Green Point Dunes and Arcadia Dunes: The C.S. Mott Nature Preserve (partially within the township).

<text>Frankfort is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located within Benzie County, the city sits upon the shore of Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Betsie River. The city had a population of 1,252 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Father Jacques Marquette, one of the first Jesuit missionaries to the Great Lakes Indians, may have died and been buried in Frankfort in May 1675. Very limited and inexact records make the death site a matter of considerable debate among historians. Frankfort is one of two locations attributed as the death site by the natives since the earliest settlers arrived in northern Michigan and one of at least two sites claimed by historians. In any case within two years the remains were taken to the church at St. Ignace and given a traditional Indian burial.

The land which was to become the City of Frankfort was recognized at an early date for its economic and commercial potential because it was nearly all purchased by the contractors who surveyed the land for the United States—the Risdon family. The first known settler in Frankfort was Joseph Oliver who purchased the between Lake Aux Becs Scies and Lake Michigan in 1852 and built a small cabin. Oliver was a woodsman who lived off the land: fishing, hunting, trapping and cutting timber. In 1855 a schooner owned by George W. Tifft of Cleveland was caught in a gale on Lake Michigan and driven before the wind. Imagine the surprise of Captain Snow when he found a previously little-known river outlet and harbor which provided a safe refuge. Thus, Aux Becs Scies Lake was discovered by an outside investor, George W. Tifft, who purchased most of the land around and adjoining the lake (more than a thousand acres (4 km2) all together). In 1859 a company from Detroit owned by Ransom Gardiner, George S. Frost, and others purchased the Tifft lands and commenced development of Frankfort within the year. In September, Louis A. Doby moved to the area as agent of the developers with John H. Adams to oversee the work. They sent along a sawmill and A.S. Dow to manage that phase of the development. Descendants of the Dow family—founders of the Dow Chemical Company—are unaware of any relationship to A.S. Dow. Doby held a contract to dredge a new channel so the harbor would be available for navigation by all types of craft. He also constructed a building for the firm which served as a hotel and store. The first lot in the development near the west end of Forest Avenue was sold to William H. Cogshall. He built a large home for his family, but his dwelling also served the fledgling community as a hotel and for religious and political meetings. The second lot, also at the west end of Forest Avenue, was purchased by Dr. Alonzo J. Slyfield, who served for 22 years as keeper of the Point Betsie Light House. Although the development had a promising start there was relatively little activity during the Civil War years. Virtually all of this early development took place in the area of First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Main Streets and Forest Avenue.

By 1867 the United States government recognized the importance of Aux Becs Scies harbor and commenced improvements. Doby&#x27;s work from 1859 had completely disappeared and a channel was dredged at the south end of the strip of land dividing the two lakes. Shortly an enthusiastic newspaperman reported four to ten vessel arrivals a day and new settlers in droves. Stores were built and a large hotel, the Delbridge House, opened for business. A post office had been established in 1860 with Cogshall as postmaster but was eventually closed for want of business. This was reopened in 1867 with N.W. Nelson postmaster. Among the other early settlers were Jacob and Charles Voorhies, J.B. Delbridge, Dr. T. Harvey, and J.B. Collins who opened his drug store in 1869.

Although the harbor was opened in 1867, work on it continued for several years. By 1870 the channel was wide and had a south pier of while the north one measured . A depth of about nine feet was maintained which allowed most of the vessels on the Great Lakes to enter the harbor. In 1873, the United States Lighthouse Service established the first pier head light to mark the entrance. In 1887 a United States Life Saving Station was established on the south side of the harbor. In 1934, as the United States Coast Guard, this station was moved to large new quarters on the Frankfort side of the channel. The original piers had been extended until they reached a length of in 1912. Between 1929 and 1932 the breakwaters were built to protect the harbor at a cost of over and the old piers were reduced in length.

When Crystal Lake Township was organized in 1859, it included all of the present Benzie County. The first township meeting was held in the spring of 1860 at Frankfort in Doby&#x27;s (the development company) store. The Benzie County government was organized by Public Act 385 of 1869 and local citizens set off in search of a county seat and a courthouse. After two elections, Frankfort was chosen and the Supervisors met in the community for the first time in April 1870. Although the first session was held in the Saterlee Hotel later sessions were held in a two-story commercial building on the corner of Second and Main Streets. However, in 1872 new elections were held and citizens of the county decided to move the county seat into the countryside east of Benzonia. Frankfort contested the move and managed to retain the seat of government, at least in name, until 1876. Following another election in 1894, the county seat returned to the community and a large school building was converted to a courthouse. Although the matter was frequently debated the county seat remained in Frankfort until 1908 when citizens voted to move it to an abandoned church in the Village of Honor.

In October 1873, the citizens of Frankfort unanimously petitioned the circuit court to become a village under a new act of the State Legislature. The petition was granted but the effort failed when the State Act was declared unconstitutional. In 1885 the citizens petitioned the State Legislature in the normal fashion and the incorporated village of Frankfort was established by Local Act No. 352 of 1885 on April 1 and by Local Act No. 352 of 1885 on May 14. (Legal boundaries of Frankfort are: Government Lots 2, 3, and 4 of Section 21; the Southeast Quarter of the Northeast Quarter of Section 21; the South Half of the North Half of Section 22; Government Lots 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Section 27; and the Northwest Fractional Quarter of Section 28 of Township No. 26 North of Range No. 16 West.)

Frankfort has enjoyed a steady growth over the years and by the 1930s had reached a population whereby they could become a city. Accordingly, voters of the village elected to become a city of the fifth class on March 11, 1935, with 229 votes in favor and 127 against. There was no change in the boundaries of the original village.

The area is a tourism hotspot, providing a wide variety of recreational opportunities, both on and off the water. Local activities, attractions, and its location near rivers, lakes, and Lake Michigan, plus forests, make it a four-season destination. This claim is proudly advertised on the arch above the town&#x27;s entrance, though some find the winters to be a difficult sell.
It is highly recommended by a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a starting point for bicycling, whether for a day trip or longer.
Shopping and antiquing in the historic downtown are a significant portion of the economic base.
Frankfort is close to the Interlochen Center for the Arts and Crystal Mountain (Michigan).

<text>Benton Harbor is a city in Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is 46 miles southwest of Kalamazoo and 71 miles southwest of Grand Rapids. According to the 2020 census, its population was 9,103. It is the smaller, by population, of the two principal cities in the Niles–Benton Harbor Metropolitan Statistical Area, an area with 156,813 people. Benton Harbor and the city of St. Joseph are separated by the St. Joseph River and are known locally as the &quot;Twin Cities&quot;. Fairplain and Benton Heights are unincorporated areas adjacent to Benton Harbor.

==History==
Benton Harbor was founded by Henry C. Morton, Sterne Brunson and Charles Hull, who all now have or have had schools named after them. Benton Harbor was mainly wetlands bordered by the Paw Paw River, through which a canal was built, hence the &quot;harbor&quot; in the city&#x27;s name. In 1860, the village was laid out by Brunson, Morton, Hull and others, and given the name Brunson Harbor.

Brunson, Morton, and Hull also donated land and solicited subscriptions for construction of the canal, which was completed in 1862. It had long been recognized that a canal would be crucial to the town&#x27;s development, both to drain the marsh and to provide a berthing area for ships. The canal, originally wide but expanded to in 1868, led to the town&#x27;s becoming a shipping and manufacturing center for the area.

In 1866, the settlement&#x27;s name was changed to Benton Harbor in honor of Thomas Hart Benton, a Missouri Senator who helped Michigan achieve statehood. In 1836, Benton Harbor was organized as a village and in 1891 it was incorporated as a city.

Benton Harbor&#x27;s retail establishments started relocating outside of the city starting in the 1950s, and the city experienced an economic downturn between 1970 and 1985.

The House of David religious group was founded there and once ran a local amusement park. 

===Riots===

Benton Harbor has had two major riots, one in 1966 and one in 2003, with smaller ones occurring in 1960, 1967, and 1990.

====1966====

On August 30, 1966, a riot began after a meeting discussing recreational facilities and police relations with respect to black residents. During the riot, a black 18-year-old named Cecil Hunt was killed in a drive-by shooting; suspects were arrested but the assault charge was later dismissed. Governor George W. Romney dispatched troops from the Michigan National Guard, who stood down on September 5 when the riot dissipated.

====2003====

In June 2003, several citizens in Benton Harbor demonstrated for two days when black motorcyclist Terrance Shurn, being chased by a police officer, crashed into a building and died. As many as 300 state troopers and law enforcement personnel from neighboring communities were called to Benton Harbor.

Indirectly, the riot contributed to the Jimmy Carter Work Project&#x27;s 2005 activities being held in Benton Harbor and Detroit. A state task force produced a report in 2003.

===Water state of emergency===

As with the 2014–2019 public health crisis involving the drinking water in Flint, in 2018 higher-than-acceptable levels of lead were found in Benton Harbor&#x27;s tap water. Water was starting to appear &quot;bubbly and white&quot; to &quot;brown&quot;, with a &quot;horrible&quot; taste and poor smell. This was due to lead-based water service lines. Testing found the samples returned lead levels of 22 parts per billion, greater than the 20 parts per billion in Flint and the federal lead action level of 15 parts per billion. High levels of copper were also noted in the annual consumer confidence reports that have been required by Environmental Protection Agency.

Concerns were with the health impacts of lead poisoning. As a result, residents were supplied with free bottled water, including for use with brushing teeth and cooking, for residences and schools. In September 2021, $10 million was budgeted to replace the lead service lines. All lead pipes had been replaced by December 1, 2023, per the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

==Government and politics==
The Michigan Treasury Department in 2009 sent a team to look into the city&#x27;s finances. The team&#x27;s report was a long list of mismanagement to the point that budgets were &quot;effectively meaningless as a financial management tool.&quot; The city was $10 million underfunded in its pension fund and increasing budget deficits. In April 2010, Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm appointed Joseph Harris as Emergency Financial Manager. City staff was reduced by 30 to 70.
Harris was given expanded powers under a new law signed in March 2011 by Republican governor Rick Snyder. Harris was previously the chief financial officer for the city of Detroit. On April 14, 2011, Harris suspended the decision-making powers of Benton Harbor&#x27;s elected city officials, who can hold meetings but are not allowed to govern. The Michigan AFL–CIO president called the move &quot;sad news for democracy in Michigan&quot;, but at least one city official, City Commissioner Bryan Joseph, supported it, saying the city had been mismanaged for decades.

On January 4, 2012, city commissioners Marcus Muhammad and MaryAlice Adams held a press conference where they stated that if there was still an emergency financial manager administering the city when Benton Harbor hosted the Senior PGA Championship in May, an &quot;Occupy PGA movement should sit in on the golf greens and driving ranges in protest.&quot; Occupy PGA did hold protest marches on multiple days during the tournament, but did not disrupt the tournament.

On January 11, 2013, the Emergency Financial Assistance Loan Board (ELB) voted to replace Harris as the Emergency Financial Manager (EFM) for the city. On February 1, 2013, the ELB appointed Tony R. Saunders II as the youngest Successor-Emergency Financial Manager for the city of Benton Harbor.

<text>Berrien Springs is a village in Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,910 at the time of the 2020 census. The village is located within Oronoko Charter Township.

==History==

Berrien Springs, like Berrien County, is named for John M. Berrien. &quot;Springs&quot; was added after mineral springs were discovered in the area. 

The village is the site of the earliest European-American settlement in Oronoko Township. It was first known as &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Prairie&quot; in reference to the 1,000-acre prairie in which it was situated. The site had been a village under the leadership of a Potawatomi chief named Wolf. 

The first permanent settlers (according to European-American terms), John Pike and his family, did not arrive until 1829. 

Francis B. Murdoch was a co-founder of the village and the first lawyer in the county. (His surname was spelled as &#x27;Murdock&#x27; in some records.) In 1831 he built a two-story log house, which is the oldest surviving example of its kind in Michigan. In 1973 this house was moved near courthouse square, to be part of that historic complex.

Murdoch was known in the antebellum period for representing enslaved African Americans in freedom suits, in which they tried to gain freedom. Michigan was established as a free territory and later state. It went by the principle of &quot;once free, always free&quot;. If slaveholders brought enslaved people to the state, the latter were judged to be free.

The village of Berrien was platted in 1831. The Berrien Springs post office opened with the name &quot;Berrien&quot; on December 4, 1832; this was changed to Berrien Springs on April 18, 1836.

Berrien Springs served as the county seat from 1837 until 1894, when St. Joseph was designated as the county seat. 

===1839 courthouse===
Berrien Springs courthouse, designed by local architect Gilbert B. Avery, was completed in 1839, making it the oldest courthouse in the state. The Greek Revival-style courthouse emulated the architecture of ancient Greece with its large columns, triangular pediment and white paint. After the county seat was moved in 1894, the building was put to various uses and briefly was vacant. In 1967, efforts to preserve and restore the courthouse were started. Such restoration was completed by 1975.

The restored courthouse square also features the Midwest&#x27;s most complete surviving mid-nineteenth century county government complex. Today the square houses a county museum and archives. The courthouse serves as headquarters for the Berrien County Historical Association. Its original buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The property is dedicated to the preservation of Berrien County&#x27;s history and does this through permanent and temporary exhibits, programs, events, and community outreach.

===Christmas pickle capital of the world===
Berrien Springs was once known as the Christmas pickle capital of the world. A festival was established by the Berrien Springs-Eau Claire Chamber of Commerce, the Berrien County Historical Association (BCHA), and the village. They featured parades, games, activities, and a Pickle Prince and Princess contest. The event ran until the mid-2000s. In 2021, the Pickle Festival was revived by the Village, the BCHA, and the Berrien Springs Community Library.

<text>Hacienda Heights () is an unincorporated suburban community in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of the 2020 census, the community had a total population of 54,191, up from 54,038 at the 2010 census. For statistical purposes, the Census Bureau has defined Hacienda Heights as a census designated place (CDP). It is the third largest CDP in Los Angeles County by area, behind Topanga and Rowland Heights, and the county&#x27;s fourth largest CDP by population.

==History==
Hacienda Heights sits on land that was originally part of Rancho La Puente.
During Spanish rule, the land around Hacienda Heights was operated by the nearby Mission San Gabriel Arcángel in San Gabriel. The Rancho was eventually acquired by John A. Rowland and William Workman in 1845 via a Mexican land grant, and eventually acquired by Elias &quot;Lucky&quot; Baldwin in the mid-1870s. In 1912, his descendant, Anita Baldwin, sold the property to Edwin Hart and Jet Torrance. In 1913 the pair subdivided the area and named it North Whittier Heights, which became known for avocado, citrus and walnut orchards. However, from the Great Depression era to the early 1940s, citrus growing became unprofitable because of pests and diseases, setting the impetus for the area&#x27;s transformation into a suburb.

Accelerating in the 1950s, suburban residential development transformed Hacienda Heights into a residential or bedroom community. In 1960, the Hacienda Heights Branch of the Los Angeles County Public Library opened. The following year, in 1961, the area was renamed Hacienda Heights. In 1964, the local newspaper, the &quot;Hacienda Heights Highlander&quot;, was established.

The hills surrounding Hacienda Heights have a history of brush fires, especially in 1978, 1989, and 2020.

<text>Galien (pronounced guh-LEEN) is a village in Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 513 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Galien Township.

==History==

The founder of the village of Galien was George A. Blakeslee. Born in Pennsylvania, he came to Galien Township in 1853. He platted Galien village in 1861, and it was incorporated in 1879. The village straddled a fairly new Michigan Central Railroad completed in 1849 from New Buffalo to Detroit. Blakeslee operated a sawmill at the site of present-day Galien, and established a general store. He purchased several thousand acres in the vicinity of the village and harvested the timber for his sawmill operation. For many years after Galien was established, he was president of the village, postmaster, justice of the peace, member of the school board and later World Bishop of the Latter Day Saint&#x27;s Church. Blakeslee Street was named after him and is located in the SE quadrant of the city plat.

On July 21, 1971, fire broke out in a hardware store in downtown Galien and destroyed that building as well as a restaurant and a beauty salon adjacent to it. Another fire on October 18, 1971, extensively damaged a nearby IGA supermarket. Between the two fires in one year, the northeast corner of the business district was destroyed.

==History==

The area is part of the homelands of the Tongva people. It became part of Rancho La Cañada, a Mexican land grant given in 1843 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to a Mexican schoolteacher from Pueblo de Los Ángeles, Ygnacio Coronel (1795–1862).

La Crescenta does not mean &quot;the crescent,&quot; which in Spanish would be &quot;el creciente&quot;. From his home, early settler Benjamin B. Briggs &quot;could see three crescent-shaped formations, which suggested to him the artificial name,&quot; accepted by the U.S. Post Office in 1888. Montrose was chosen &quot;as the result of a contest for the subdivision established in 1913 on part of the La Crescenta development.

===The Great Flood of 1934===
In November 1933, wildfires raged through the nearby San Gabriel mountains above the communities of La Crescenta, La Cañada and Montrose. During the last week of December of that year, a series of winter storms pounded the mountainside with of rain. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, more heavy rains led to sporadic flooding.

Around midnight, hillsides in at least three mountain locations collapsed sending millions of tons of mud and debris into the Crescenta Valley neighborhoods below.

More than 400 homes were destroyed in La Cañada, La Crescenta, Montrose and Tujunga. Scores of people were killed, and hundreds were left homeless. Entire families were wiped out. The mudslides that began in the mountains above La Cañada and La Crescenta carved a path of destruction all the way to the Verdugo Wash and beyond.Some Montrose residents sought shelter from flooding at American Legion Post 288, which was destroyed, killing 12.
Parts of Foothill Boulevard were buried under of mud, boulders and debris. The mud was deep enough to bury cars completely on Montrose Avenue. Miles of Honolulu Boulevard were inundated by several feet of sand and silt.

Two notable victims of the flood were silent-era identical-twin child actors Winston and Weston Doty, who died at the age of 19.

Following the disaster, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the County of Los Angeles built a flood control system of catch basins and concrete storm drains, designed to prevent a repeat of the 1934 disaster.

The flood was commemorated in Woody Guthrie&#x27;s song &quot;Los Angeles New Year&#x27;s Flood&quot;. To honor the victims of that New Year&#x27;s calamity and to mark its 75th anniversary, a small monument was dedicated January 1, 2004, at Rosemont and Fairway avenues in Montrose, near where the American Legion Hall had stood.

== In popular culture ==
In the spring of 2012, a black bear wandered regularly from the Angeles National Forest into the La Crescenta-Montrose-Glendale residential area, rummaging through trash cans and showing a preference for Costco meatballs and tuna. The bear was subdued in La Crescenta and returned to the forest. A Twitter account from an individual posting as &quot;GlenBearian&quot; appeared with updates from the bear&#x27;s perspective.

The historic 1946 La Crescenta Motel, formerly known as the May Lane Motel, with its classic postwar L-shaped layout on Foothill Boulevard, has been used as a location for numerous feature films and television shows, such as &quot;Glee&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds,&quot; &quot;Mad Men&quot; and &quot;True Blood&quot;.

Rockhaven Sanitarium on Honolulu Avenue, built entirely of rock, opened in 1923. It became known as the &quot;Screen Actors&#x27; Sanitarium,&quot; housing such patients as Billie Burke and Gladys Baker, mother of Marilyn Monroe. Closed in 2006, the property was purchased by the City of Glendale in 2008. As of early 2016, the site is being considered for &quot;adaptive reuse.&quot;

Another, more notorious sanitarium existed in La Crescenta from the 1920s to the early 1960s. A few yards west of the La Crescenta Motel, on the corner of Foothill Boulevard and Rosemont Avenue, is the site of the Kimball Sanitarium, which was housed in a large, foreboding, converted Victorian mansion built in the 1880s. Bela Lugosi attempted to overcome his morphine addiction at the Kimball, represented in the Tim Burton film &quot;Ed Wood&quot;. Actress Frances Farmer, misdiagnosed as a &quot;paranoid schizophrenic,&quot; received insulin shock therapy at Kimball. Plans to expand the sanitarium were rejected by local residents in the early 1960s, and the sanitarium was torn down. Construction workers readying the building for demolition found padded cells with straitjackets and manacles attached to the walls. The site became a shopping plaza in 1989, and a Ralphs supermarket occupies the spot where the disreputable sanitarium once stood.

During a bipolar episode in 1996, actress Margot Kidder attempted to walk from downtown Los Angeles to the La Crescenta home of a friend, writer Rosie Shuster. Kidder was discovered in Glendale and hospitalized.

==Government and infrastructure==

In the state legislature, La Crescenta-Montrose is situated in the 25th senate district, represented by Senator Anthony Portantino, and the 44th assembly district, represented by Assemblywoman Laura Friedman. The area is in California&#x27;s 28th congressional district, represented by Congresswoman Judy Chu.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD) operates the Crescenta Valley Station in La Crescenta, serving La Crescenta and Montrose.

===Crescenta Valley Town Council===
The Crescenta Valley Town Council (CVTC) is composed of nine democratically elected councilmembers, each of whom serve three-year terms upon installation. CVTC is currently the Los Angeles County unincorporated area&#x27;s main advisory body to the county supervisor&#x27;s office and other governing agencies, as well as an organized institution that is often counted on to facilitate community-wide forums to inform or garner opinion from residents.

==Points of historical interest==
St. Luke&#x27;s of the Mountains Episcopal Church was designed and built by the famous artist Seymour Thomas in 1924. Constructed of natural stone from the valley, it is reminiscent of a woodlands church in northern Europe. It is considered to be the architectural centerpiece of the valley. St. Luke&#x27;s is located at 2563 Foothill Boulevard.
&quot;Le Mesnager&quot; Barn is a stone barn perched high above the valley, built in 1911 by George Le Mesnager, a French patriot, to store and process grapes from his vineyards in the Sparr Heights area. These grapes supplied his Old Hermitage Vineyards in downtown Los Angeles. There is still a Mesnager Street in the downtown area where the winery had been located. The barn, now owned by the City of Glendale, is an educational nature/history center. Le Mesnager Barn is located in Deukmejian Wilderness Park at the top of Dunsmore Ave.

La Crescenta is home to one of two American ashrams founded by Indian teacher and mystic poet Swami Paramananda who came to America in 1906. Founded in 1923, the Ananda Ashram is located at the top of Pennsylvania Avenue near Deukmejian Wilderness Park.

The La Crescenta Woman&#x27;s Club began in 1911, incorporated in 1923, and built its clubhouse in 1925. The structure, the social center of the valley for most of the last century, is the home for the organization&#x27;s many charitable and social events. The La Crescenta Woman&#x27;s Club is located at 4004 La Crescenta Avenue.

Sparr Heights Community Center was built early in 1922 by William S. Sparr as the real estate office for the Sparr Heights residential tract, originally named Oakmont Park. It was donated to the City of Glendale on December 24, 1922, and has been a community meeting place and senior center since then. Sparr Heights Community Center is located at 1613 Glencoe Way, across the street from John C. Fremont Elementary School.

La Crescenta Elementary School was built in 1887 at the corner of Foothill and Dyer, but soon moved to a new location at La Crescenta and Prospect. A wooden schoolhouse was built on this site in 1890. A larger school building replaced it in 1914, and the present structure was erected in 1948.

The Old School Bell: La Crescenta&#x27;s school bell first rang students to school from across the valley in 1890. It was placed in storage from 1948 until 1976 when it was re-hung and dedicated with a plaque listing the names of the children in the first class at La Crescenta Elementary. The bell, located in front of La Crescenta Elementary School, is rung once a year in June by the graduating students.

La Crescenta Presbyterian Church is a striking church building constructed in 1923. This is one of the older congregations in the valley, first meeting in the 1880s. In the congregation&#x27;s early years, it shared facilities with the elementary school as did the Episcopals that later built St. Luke&#x27;s. La Crescenta Presbyterian Church is located at 2902 Montrose Avenue.

<doc id="117163" wikidata="Q3319767" url="?curid=117163" title="Grand Beach, Michigan">
<text>Grand Beach is a village in Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 310 at the 2020 census. The village is within New Buffalo Township on the shore of Lake Michigan near to the Michigan-Indiana border.

==History==

Grand Beach was founded by the Grand Beach Company around 1903. It was conceived of partially as a short-stay resort. People would take the Michigan Central Railroad to Grand Beach station, rent small cottages for a day or two, eat in the dining hall (located at the corner of Lakeview and Whitewood), and enjoy bathing and golfing. The town was incorporated in 1934 to allow property owners to retain more control.
Its lakeshore beach has always been important to Grand Beach. An entertainment pier was built out into Lake Michigan and offered dining and dancing in the 1920s. The pier has long since disappeared, though its supporting posts are sometimes visible when the lake levels are low. The Golfmore Hotel was built as a luxury hotel just across the creek in Michiana, Michigan. A footbridge over the creek linked the hotel to the pier area. The hotel was an important part of the social life of the beach in the 1920s, even in the winter when it hosted ski jumping events. The hotel burned down on November 19, 1939.

The public golf course has been an integral part of village life at Grand Beach since its establishment. At one time there were 27 holes, but for many decades the course has been a 9-hole course that runs from the club house down to the village gate and back. In the 1950s the village hall moved from the old dining hall structure on the lake to the newly built golf club house / community center.

Lake levels have affected the focus of village social activities. During periods when lake levels were high, beach frontage has sometimes been minimal. Erosion of beachfront properties was especially noticeable in the early 1950s, early 1970s, and late 2010s.

Three Frank Lloyd Wright homes were built in Grand Beach. One of them, the Ernest Vosburgh Summer House (built in 1916) on Ravine Road near Crescent and Royal, still retains much of its original design.

The 1950s brought relative decline as all of Southwest Michigan was bypassed by Chicagoans in favor of more exotic resorts. However, beginning in the 1980s, Grand Beach and nearby New Buffalo have undergone a renaissance as a charming, unpretentious, yet accessible resort area. The former Forest Beach YWCA camp was developed as a gated community with multimillion-dollar homes, thus giving the area a slightly more upscale image.

In recent decades Grand Beach has probably been most famous because of its association with Chicago&#x27;s Daley family.

==Geography==

===Flooding===
Lake Charter Township derived its name from the existence of a high water table. The community was built on top of an ancient lake named &quot;Lake Baroda&quot;.

Due to the soil composition and failure of state and local governments to maintain infrastructure to manage storm water, the area is prone to flooding.

<text>New Buffalo is a city in Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,708 during the 2020 census.

==History==
The area around the mouth of the Galien River was originally populated by Miami and Potawatomi peoples. Later, French missionaries visited the area on their search for the fabled Northwest Passage. The area remained sparsely populated, even as Michigan Territory was petitioning for statehood.

In 1834 a sea-captain from Buffalo, New York—Wessel Whittaker—and his crew were shipwrecked on the Lake Michigan coast south of the Galien River outlet. As they headed back to Saint Joseph, MI to report the loss of their ship, Whittaker noticed the possibilities of the New Buffalo area as a potential harbor. He purchased the land around the river-mouth and with various family members in tow, returned and named his new settlement New Buffalo.

Compared to larger harbors along the coast, New Buffalo wasn&#x27;t a contender initially. However, the new Michigan Central Railway was being built across Michigan in the late 1830s. This new transportation route terminated for several years in New Buffalo, leading to explosive growth. Railway passengers would stop in town to wait for steamers to finish taking them to Chicago, creating a demand for hotels. Unfortunately, the rail line was completed directly to Chicago, which made New Buffalo just another stop along the route. The boom times were over.

As the 19th century progressed, New Buffalo area became a popular vacation getaway spot for Chicagoans. It was easily reached by train and was miles away from the heavy industry of Gary, Indiana and the hustle and bustle of Chicago, Illinois. New Buffalo area also preserved the sand dunes that are common along the Lake Michigan shore. In the early 20th Century, US Highway 12 was constructed through town, allowing autos to drive there directly. In the mid-20th century, Interstate 94 was constructed just east of town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is located on Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Galien River. This forms a natural harbor, which is part of the current pleasure-boat harbor drawing summer residents and boaters.

<text>New Buffalo Township is a civil township of Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 2,455. It is the southwesternmost township on the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

==Communities==
*The city of New Buffalo is within the township, but is administratively autonomous.
*The villages of Grand Beach and Michiana are also within the township.
*The unincorporated community of Union Pier is situated on the boundary between New Buffalo Township and Chikaming Township.

The township is part of a region sometimes referred to as Harbor Country.

==History==

At the time of the arrival of the first Europeans to the area, French explorer Father Jacques Marquette in 1675 reported seeing the Miami people in his travels down the nearby St. Joseph River. Four years later, the exploration party of René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, reported that the Miami were being displaced by the Potawatomi.

When Berrien County was first established in 1831, New Buffalo was a part of Berrien Township. New Buffalo Township was established by an act of the state legislature on March 12, 1836. Five days later, the village of New Buffalo was incorporated. The township originally included what are now Three Oaks Township and Chikaming Township. Three Oaks and Chikaming were set apart in 1856.

In 1834, one of the first permanent European-American settlers to the area, Captain Wessell Whittaker, ran his schooner &quot;Post Boy&quot; aground near what is now the village of Grand Beach. The captain and crew found shelter a bit south of there at the present-day Michigan City, Indiana. While traveling north to St. Joseph to report the ship&#x27;s loss to its underwriters, Whittacker was so struck by the beauty of the area and the natural harbor that he filed claim to a large tract of land around the mouth of the Galien River. Whittacker named it after his hometown of Buffalo, New York.

After laying out plans for the city and gaining partners to develop the area, the value of land rapidly increased in a period of land speculation. This lasted until the Panic of 1837, which brought an abrupt end to most speculative land development in the area for several years. Followed soon after by a severe winter in 1841, the area struggled economically. The western terminus of the Michigan Central Railroad in New Buffalo was completed in 1849. The harbor was improved and the economy flourished briefly until the railroad connection to Chicago was completed in 1853, after which the use of the harbor for shipping declined.

Around the turn of the century, the area began to be recognized for its vacation and resort potential, resulting in summer cottages, camps and hotels. 1921 saw the opening of the Golfmore Hotel, rated as one of the finest resorts on the Great Lakes. Unfortunately, the hotel was destroyed by fire in 1936. Like much of the country, the area struggled through the Great Depression, followed by booming growth after World War II.

During the 1970s and 1980s nightclubs just north of the Indiana state line in New Buffalo Township were popular destinations for young adults from Illinois and Indiana who were under age 21. Both of those states had minimum drinking ages of 21, whereas Michigan&#x27;s minimum drinking age was 18.

The village of Michiana within New Buffalo Township consists of the partial section 24 of survey township T8S R22E, the westernmost portion of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The rest of the township consists of the several partial and whole sections of T8S R21E as well as the western row of sections from T8S R20E, section 31 of T7S R20E, and section 35 and 36 of T7S R21E.

<doc id="117171" wikidata="Q1966409" url="?curid=117171" title="Lake Los Angeles, California">
<text>Lake Los Angeles is a census-designated place (CDP) in Los Angeles County, California, United States. The population was 13,187 at the 2020 census, up from 12,328 at the 2010 census. It is located east of Palmdale&#x27;s Civic Center. According to the Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance report of 2009, the &quot;Palmdale / Lancaster&quot; urban area has a population of 483,998, of which Lake Los Angeles is a part.

==Transportation==
Public transportation services are operated by the Antelope Valley Transit Authority. The route 50 bus travels from Lake Los Angeles&#x27;s Town Center Plaza to Owen Memorial Park in Lancaster. Route 51 also serves Town Center Plaza, but terminates at Palmdale Transportation Center. Each route runs about every two hours all week, with a one-way fare of $1.50.

==History==

The region was once called &quot;Los Angeles Buttes&quot;, since they were the only ones in the northern part of the county. The eponymous lakes (one dedicated to fishing and one dedicated to swimming and boating) have dried up. The fishing lake was stocked with trout, bass and catfish. In 1967, during the 1960s land speculation boom in the Antelope Valley, land developers bought in the region, subdivided it into 4,465 lots, and artificially refilled the natural lake and named it Lake Los Angeles as an enticement to land buyers. Advertisements showed a water skier on the lake (which was probably no more than 5 feet deep) and a showcase home on the top of the nearby hill, giving the impression of a resort town. There was a country club and a high-end restaurant that overlooked the large recreational lake. There was also a small store/bar and grill. Streets were named Biglake Avenue, Lakespring Avenue and Longmeadow Avenue to draw attention away from the fact that the town was in fact a barren desert used for filming westerns. The lake was left to evaporate in the early 1980s after the initial developers sold their interests. Much of the land was sold to buyers who never visited the area. There are efforts to refill the lake, but the main obstacle has been funding.

The film history of the region dates back to 1938. Numerous movies, serials, commercials and television series were filmed in Lake Los Angeles for decades. Filmed segments and stock footage of &quot;Bonanza&quot; episodes made at the region include &quot;The Mission&quot;, &quot;Gallagher&#x27;s Sons&quot;, &quot;Twilight Town&quot;, &quot;Big Shadow on the Land&quot;, &quot;The Deed and the Dilemma&quot;, &quot;The Oath&quot;, &quot;Second Chance&quot; and &quot;Meena.&quot; Lake Los Angeles has two permanent film sets: Four Aces, a replica mid-century style rest stop with a diner, gas station and motel, used in the films &quot;Identity&quot;, &quot;Fall&quot;, and &quot;Palm Springs&quot;; and Club Ed, a more dilapidated early 20th century gas station and two-story house, originally built for the 1991 film &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;, since used in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; and &quot;Torque&quot;. Both locations and their surrounding areas have been used for television series, feature films, music videos, and television commercials.

<text>Oronoko Charter Township is a charter township of Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 9,226 at the 2020 census.

==Communities==
The village of Berrien Springs is the only incorporated municipality within the township.

==History==
The township was organized on March 11, 1837, from a portion of Berrien Township. Part of the area was known as Feather Settlement starting in the 1830s.

Oronoko initially included what is now Lake Township, which was organized in 1846. Originally, portions of both Oronoko and Berrien townships were on either side of the St. Joseph River, and at the time a large portion of the village of Berrien Springs was in Berrien Township, even though it was on the other side of the river from most of the township. In 1847, the river was made the dividing line between the townships.

There are several accounts given for the name of the township. One is that it was named by Governor Stevens T. Mason after the Indian chief named &quot;Oronoko&quot;. However, apart from this story, there is no record that there ever was such a chief. Another is that it is a variant spelling of Orinoco, the name of a South American river that was adopted with various spellings in other states besides Michigan: Oronoco, Minnesota, and Oronoque, Kansas. Others believe the township was named after the literary character Oroonoko, which was also derived from the South American river. A final possibility suggested by Vogel is that the name was taken from a variety of tobacco known as &quot;oronoco&quot;, &quot;orinoko&quot;, or &quot;oronooka&quot;.

==Geography==

<text>Paw Paw Lake is an unincorporated community in Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is a census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes, without legal status as a municipality. The community is located within areas of both Coloma Charter Township and Watervliet Township in the area surrounding Paw Paw Lake and Little Paw Paw Lake, excluding the cities of Watervliet and Coloma. The population of the CDP was 3,323 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The area which became the CDP was the site of a tourist area in the early 20th century. An 1894 Chicago newspaper article was the catalyst in making the shore a resort area, and a rail line extension from nearby Coloma in 1896 started the building boom. Pavilions, hotels, and cottages soon followed, with nationally known acts performing at the pavilions. Most of these buildings no longer exist.

===Deer Forest===

The nearby Deer Forest animal park in Coloma Township opened at the end of the heyday of the resort area. Though many of its assets were auctioned off on September 26, 2009, the park continued to operate through the 2014 season. It closed permanently at the end of that season and animals were dispersed to various other locations. The property itself was auctioned off on June 29, 2015. It was auctioned again in 2021 and sold in March 2022.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 24.47%, is water, consisting primarily of Paw Paw Lake and Little Paw Paw Lake. The Paw Paw River, outlet of the lakes, forms most of the southern boundary of the CDP. North Coloma Road forms the western edge of the CDP, Hagar Shore Road the north edge, and highway M-140 the eastern edge. The cities of Watervliet and Coloma touch the CDP at its southeast and southwest corners, respectively.

==Demographics==

<text>Pipestone Township is a civil township of Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 2,177 at the 2020 census. The township was organized on February 16, 1842.

==History==
The first settler in the township was James Kirk, who moved with his family to Niles, Michigan, in 1833 and then established a residence in Pipestone in April 1837. In the fall of 1837, Dr. Morgan Enos moved from Bainbridge Township and settled at a point that became known as &quot;Shanghai Corners&quot;, because, according to local history, Dr. Enos was the first to bring Shanghai chickens into the township. Joab Enos, a brother of Dr. Enos, moved into the township in 1838. He and William Boughton laid out a village known first as &quot;Pipestone&quot;, and later as &quot;Shanghai&quot;. Although only a few lots were sold, a post office was established in the village in 1846, and later there was a store operated by John Garrow.

The word &quot;pipestone&quot; refers to a red stone, known today as catlinite, which is used to make the bowls of some Indian ceremonial pipes. Pipestone Creek was so named because Native Americans have found material for making pipes along its course. The name was later extended to Pipestone Township.

== Communities ==
* The village of Eau Claire lies partially within the township and partially within Berrien Township to the south. There are no other incorporated municipalities within the township. The township is primarily agricultural.

<text>Sodus Township is a civil township of Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,995 at the 2020 census. There are no incorporated municipalities in the township. The unincorporated community of Sodus in the northwest of the township is its main settlement; the portion of the township just to the west is part of the Benton Harbor/St. Joseph urban area.

==History==
Probably the first entrepreneur in Sodus Township was James LaRue, a New Jersey native, who purchased riverfront land for the construction of a sawmill in 1835. The first permanent settler, however, was David S. Rector who, in 1837, took possession of 40 acres of land. 
 The name of the township came from Rector. He and his brother, William H., came to the area by way of keel boat from Sodus, New York, so the township was named such in 1859 after the town from which they departed.

In 1853, Joab Enos built a flour mill, also on Pipestone Creek. The township was organized on October 11, 1859. In 1891, Ernest Tabor established Tabor Farm Summer Resort on the banks of the St. Joseph River. The resort was open during summers and hosted reunions, conventions and banquets. From 1961 to 1983, it was owned and managed by Alma and Valdas Adamkus, future President of Lithuania. The resort was closed in 1990.

Sodus has had retail establishments in the past, though it has none now.

==Geography==
The St. Joseph River forms most of the western boundary of the township, with Royalton Township on the other side of the river. The township shares a short western border with the community of Fair Plain in Benton Charter Township north of the St. Joseph River. Benton Charter Township continues as the township to the north, Bainbridge Township is to the northeast, Pipestone Township to the east, Berrien Township to the southeast, and Oronoko Charter Township to the south. A new segment of US 31 was completed in August 2003 that re-routed the highway through the township. Interstate 94 crosses the northwest corner of the township with two interchanges located nearby.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.91%, is water.

<doc id="117180" wikidata="Q2205508" url="?curid=117180" title="St. Joseph, Michigan">
<text>St. Joseph, colloquially known as St. Joe, is a city and the county seat of Berrien County, Michigan. It was incorporated as a village in 1834 and as a city in 1891. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 7,856. It lies on the shore of Lake Michigan, at the mouth of the St. Joseph River, about east-northeast of Chicago. It is home of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

==History==
The mouth of the St. Joseph River at present day St. Joseph was an important point of Amerindian travel and commerce, as it lay along a key water route between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. Both the Miami and Potawatomi used this route and would use the area as a camp. The St. Joseph River also allowed for connection with the Sauk Trail, which was the major land trail through Michigan. In 1669, the mouth of the river was seen by European explorers. French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, built Fort Miami on the bluff overlooking Lake Michigan. In 1678, he waited for the ship &quot;Le Griffon&quot;, which never returned. Once the ship was deemed lost, La Salle and his men made the first land crossing of the lower peninsula by Europeans.

The next permanent white settler in St. Joseph was William Burnett, who around 1780 started a trading post at the mouth of the St. Joseph River. The post traded food, furs and goods with places including Detroit, Mackinac and Chicago. In 1829, Calvin Britain, who had come from Jefferson County, New York, and had taught at the Carey Mission at Niles for two years, came to the site of St. Joseph. Shortly thereafter, he laid out the plat of the village, then known as Newburyport, named after a coastal city in Massachusetts. Britain was influential in attracting other settlers to the area. Lots sold rapidly and the village flourished.

The St. Joseph river mouth was straightened through a channel and piers were added later. The first lighthouse in St. Joseph contends with Chicago&#x27;s original lighthouse as the first to be built on Lake Michigan. Newburyport changed its name to St. Joseph when it was incorporated on March 7, 1834. The city was incorporated June 5, 1891.

The first water route across Lake Michigan between St. Joseph and Chicago began as a mail route in 1825, but service was sporadic until 1842 when Samuel and Eber Ward began a permanent service. That lasted eleven years. Before the rise of large ship companies on Lake Michigan, service was done primarily by owner-operated boats. With the rise in shipping in Benton Harbor and the rise in tourism in St. Joseph, permanent and larger operations began operating out of the ports.
The Coast Guard still maintains a station on this site.
In 1876 the United States Lifesaving Service built a Lifesaving Station at St Joseph, appointing Joseph Napier as the first stationkeeper.
After a bitterly fought political contest, St. Joseph was named the seat of Berrien County in 1894, when Berrien Springs relinquished that status. The three largest towns in the county, Benton Harbor, St. Joseph, and Niles, each wanted to be the county seat, but none had a majority vote. Once St. Joseph and Benton Harbor voters combined their votes, St. Joseph had enough to win.

On October 11, 1898, Augustus Moore Herring took one of his gliders, fitted with a motor, to Silver Beach in St. Joseph. Herring&#x27;s machine lifted ever so slightly off the ground and actually flew for seven seconds. Eleven days later, the inventor made another flight of ten seconds. While Herring had a powered heavier-than-air craft, he did not have a way to control it. It was left to the Wright brothers to perfect controlled flight five years later, and give themselves and Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, a place in history that might have ended up belonging to Herring and St. Joseph.

===Transportation history===
Two major shipping companies operated between St. Joseph and Chicago during the last half of the 19th century, the Goodrich Transportation company and the local firm of Graham and Morton. They dominated the traffic at St. Joseph for more than 100 years, although other smaller companies did operate during this time.

Starting in 1874, Henry Graham and J. Stanley Morton began operating a steam line out of St. Joseph. Their collaboration would become the Graham and Morton Transportation Company. Through vigorous competition, they won the war to become the major carrier out of St. Joseph. Goodrich stopped service to the Twin Cities in 1880. The company grew fast and over the fifty plus years of its existence became the second largest line on Lake Michigan behind only Goodrich.
In 1924, as graded roads began to line the Lake Michigan shoreline, G &amp; M was forced to merge into Goodrich. Like most other ports along Lake Michigan, St. Joseph saw a huge drop in traffic during the early years of the twentieth century and this was exacerbated by the Great Depression. The route between Chicago and St. Joseph did survive until the 1950s.
On January 29, 1870, the Chicago and Michigan Lake Shore Railroad extended a rail line from New Buffalo to St. Joseph. This railroad connected St. Joseph to Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Detroit and Chicago. (Prior to this, the only connection St. Joseph had to these other cities was by water.) The line was reorganized as the Chicago and West Michigan Railway and then was incorporated into the Pere Marquette Railroad. Nowadays it is recognized as the CSX Grand Rapids Subdivision which runs from Chicago, IL to Grand Rapids,MI along the former Pere Marquette Railroad. Passenger Rail Service is provided by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Pere Marquette&quot; service running from Chicago, IL to Grand Rapids,MI with stops in St Joeseph, Bangor, Holland, And Grand Rapids. Service is offered with one daily round trip.

===Business and industry history===
In 1892, Truscott Boat Manufacturing Co moved to St. Joseph from Grand Rapids. In the early 20th Century, the company was the largest employer in St. Joseph with 700 employees and built 600 wooden boats per year. The company built boats for the government in World War I, struggled during the Depression, was sold in 1940, revived during World War II to build ships for the Navy and went bankrupt in 1948.

In 1911, Louis, Emory, and Frederick Upton began a business that produced household washing machines. The business soon became a boom and has continued to grow to this day. In 1929, Upton Machine Company merged with Nineteen Hundred Corp., taking the latter name. The company began marketing a line of appliances known as the &quot;Whirlpool&quot; brand in 1948. Within the next decade, Nineteen Hundred changed its name to Whirlpool. Today, Whirlpool Corporation is the largest manufacturer of major home appliances and maintains a large presence in Benton Harbor and nearby St. Joseph. Whirlpool has its world headquarters in Benton Harbor.

In 1891 the Silver Beach Amusement Park was opened on land between the lake and mouth of the river in St. Joseph. Logan Drake and Louis Wallace bought the land from the Pere Marquette Railroad and added cottages to lure tourists to the lake front. As the park aged and grew in popularity, the pair added many attractions, including concessions, games, pool, a boardwalk and different rides. The first roller coaster was built in 1904 and was called the Chase Through the Clouds, which was replaced by the Velvet roller coaster (renamed the Comet). Among the most popular attractions were the carousel and the Shadowland Ballroom, built in 1927. During the 1960s and 1970s, the buildings decayed and the crowds decreased. Finally, crime in the park led police to shut it down in 1970.

City government is organized as a council-manager government. There is a city commission with five members, who are elected at large. City elections are held in November of even-numbered years; at each election, three commission seats become open. The two candidates receiving the greatest number of votes receive four-year terms, while the candidate receiving the third-greatest number of votes receives a two-year term. At the first meeting following each election, the commission selects from its own number a mayor and mayor pro tem for the following two years. The city commission is a part-time body, typically meeting twice each month to act as a legislative body and set general policies. Day-to-day operations are delegated to a contracted city manager.

Major city facilities include the City Hall and Police Station at 700 Broad Street; the Department of Public Works at 1160 Broad Street; the Fire Department at 915 Broad Street; the Maud Preston Palenske Public Library at 500 Market Street; the John and Dede Howard Ice Arena at 2414 Willa Drive; the Water Treatment Plant at 1701 Lions Park Drive; and Riverview Cemetery at 2525 Niles Road.

The city Water Treatment Plant provides drinking water to the communities of the Lake Michigan Shoreline Water and Sewage Treatment Authority, which serves Lincoln Charter Township, Royalton Township, St. Joseph Charter Township, and the villages of Shoreham and Stevensville. Wastewater treatment is provided through the Joint Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is jointly owned by the cities of St. Joseph and Benton Harbor, and which also serves the LMSWSTA communities, Benton Charter Township and portions of Sodus Township.

==Culture==
St. Joseph is cohost of the annual Blossomtime Festival with Benton Harbor.

The Krasl Art Fair on the Bluff is held in Lake Bluff Park every year on the weekend after the July 4 weekend.

The Concours d&#x27;Elegance of Southwest Michigan is held annually on the second Saturday in August. The inaugural show was held in 2005. An invitational fine car show, 75 vintage car owners are asked to show vehicles in St. Joseph&#x27;s downtown Lake Bluff Park.

===Venetian Festival===
From 1979 to 2011, St. Joseph was the site of the Venetian Festival, which comprised three traditions: the Blessing of the River, the Lighted Boat Parade, and a Classic Boat Parade. The festival&#x27;s name was a nod to similarities between St. Joseph and Venice, Italy.

In 1987, USS &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; came to port, and its commander let festival-goers take a free tour. This initiated a tradition whereby US Navy ships regularly came to the festival. Music also contributed to the festival&#x27;s success, and was offered at three locations: the , Shadowland Pavilion, and the Main Stage. Many local musicians played at the Bluff and the Pavilion, while the Main Stage hosted such well-known bands as the Beach Boys, Cheap Trick, Gin Blossoms, Little Big Town, and Jason Michael Carroll.

In a study done by Michigan State University in 1998, approximately 63,000 people attended the 1997 Venetian Festival and the festival generated around $1.7 million in revenue to the local economy.

Competitions also took place along Silver Beach and the Saint Joseph River during the festival, including volleyball tournaments, a river run &amp; walk, and sand sculpturing. The Lighted Boat Parade and the Classic Boat Display both took place along the St. Joseph River and were a part of the Venetian Festival since 1987. Fireworks and rides were also attractions, bringing people from bigger cities such as Chicago. A blessing of the river was done July 30, and continues as a tradition to this day.

<text>Three Oaks is a village in Three Oaks Township, Berrien County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,370 at the 2020 census.

The village of Three Oaks is located in the southwest corner of Michigan, just 5 miles from the shores of Lake Michigan and within 2 miles of the Indiana border along US 12.

==History==

The village was first settled by Henry Chamberlain in 1850 and became a village in 1867. The village was originally called Chamberlain&#x27;s Siding but was changed to Three Oaks. These oak trees were a guidepoint for train engineers. None of the original three oak trees remain today; the last was cut down in the early 20th century.

Three Oaks&#x27; hometown pride is evident during its Flag Day Celebration in June. The celebration and Flag Day Parade is the largest in the country.

&quot;Apple Cider Century&quot; is a bicycle ride of 15, 25, 37, 50, 62, 75 or 100 miles around Three Oaks. It was started by the Three Oaks Spokes Bicycle Club in 1974. More than 6,000 riders take part annually. It is held on the last Sunday of September.

Three Oaks celebrated the centennial of receiving the Dewey Cannon at the village&#x27;s Flag Day Festival (June 9–11, 2000). A historical marker at Dewey Cannon Park in Three Oaks relates: &quot;This cannon, captured in the Spanish–American War by Admiral Dewey, was presented to Three Oaks when its citizens raised fourteen hundred dollars for a memorial to the men of the battleship &quot;Maine&quot;. This was the largest contribution, per capita, of any community in the nation. &#x27;Three Oaks Against the World&#x27;, a local paper proudly boasted. This park was dedicated October 17, 1899, by President William McKinley, and others. Presentation of the cannon took place on June 28, 1900. Guest of honor was Helen Miller Gould, called the Spanish–American War&#x27;s &#x27;Florence Nightingale&#x27;. Thousands of people were in attendance on each occasion.&quot; The Dewey Cannon, which remains on display in the park of the same name, bears the engraved monogram of Queen Isabella II of Spain.

The Christmas movie &quot;Prancer&quot;, released in 1989, was filmed on location largely in the village of Three Oaks(other locations in nearby LaPorte, Indiana, were also used). A sequel, &quot;Prancer Returns&quot;, was made in 2001 (filming location Uxbridge, Ontario), in which a boy comes to Three Oaks to learn about the &quot;Prancer incident&quot;.

Three Oaks is also home to the Warren Featherbone Factory, which was built over a century ago by Edward Kirk Warren to strip turkey feathers of their quills to use in women&#x27;s garments of the era, such as corsets, which used &quot;stiffeners&quot;. This replacement for the &quot;whalebone&quot; material was welcomed by the garment industry of the late 19th century. The factory still stands today and houses the Journeyman Distillery, Acorn Theater, and Featherbone Factory.

A financial crisis occurred in 2008, after the village proceeded with a $350,000 five block street project. This and other expenses over the previous four years left Three Oaks a deficit of about $600,000 (about a one-year budget) by April 2008. The Village President, the Clerk, and a councilman resigned while two councilmen did not seek re-election. On November 4, 2008, a new slate of village councilors were voted into office. The village faced bankruptcy in early December 2008 due to fiscal mismanagement and the State of Michigan took over financial management of the village with the appointment of a financial manager. The state of Michigan appointed Emergency Financial Manager Pam Amato effective December 17, 2008, to take over village operations and guide the newly elected Council through development of a five-year deficit elimination plan. On April 29, 2009, the EFM laid off every officer except the chief of police. The laid off officers were brought back around 2 weeks later. The village was given a recommendation to disband its Downtown Development Authority, after an audit showed receipt of excess funds that should have gone to the school district. Amato ended work as the emergency manager on December 4, 2009. On February 10, 2010, the Village of Three Oaks hired Patrick Yoder to serve as the first Village Manager.

<text>Bellingwedde () was a municipality in the province Groningen in the northeast of the Netherlands. Bellingwedde was established in 1968, when the municipalities of Bellingwolde and Wedde merged. After almost 50 years, Bellingwedde was disestablished in 2018, when the municipalities of Bellingwedde and Vlagtwedde merged into Westerwolde.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Bellingwedde&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;Bellingwolde&quot; and &quot;Wedde&quot;, which are the names of the two municipalities that were merged in 1968 to form Bellingwedde. At the time, three names were considered for the new municipality: &quot;Bellingewedde&quot;, proposed by the province of Groningen, &quot;Bellingwolde-Wedde&quot;, proposed by the municipal council of Bellingwolde, and &quot;Bellingwedde&quot;, proposed by the municipal council of Wedde. The province selected the last option, which was eventually also accepted by the municipal council of Bellingwolde.

== History ==
On 1 September 1968, the municipality of Bellingwedde was formed by merging the municipalities of Bellingwolde and Wedde.

Henk Eijsink of the Labour Party, who was the last mayor of Bellingwolde and acting mayor of Wedde, became the first mayor of Bellingwedde in 1968–1970. He was followed by Jurjen Jan Hoeksema (Labour; 1970–1978), Engbert Drenth (Labour; 1979–2007), Erik Triemstra (Christian Democratic Appeal; 2007–2013) and Janneke Snijder-Hazelhoff (People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy; 2013–2018).

The municipality merged with Vlagtwedde into the new municipality of Westerwolde on 1 January 2018.

== Geography ==
Bellingwedde is located at in the east of the province of Groningen, in the northeast of the Netherlands on the border with Germany. It is in the south of the region of Oldambt and in the north of the region of Westerwolde.

Bellingwedde is bordered by the Dutch municipalities of Oldambt (in the north), Pekela (west), Stadskanaal (south-west), and Vlagtwedde (south), and by the German municipalities of Rhede (south-east) and Bunde (north-east). The nearest city is Winschoten.

The municipality contains the villages Bellingwolde, Blijham, Oudeschans, Veelerveen, Vriescheloo, and Wedde. It also contains the hamlets Den Ham, Klein-Ulsda, Rhederbrug, and Wedderveer.

The north border of Bellingwedde follows the river Pekel Aa. The river Westerwoldse Aa crosses the east of Bellingwedde from south to north. The canal B.L. Tijdenskanaal, that unites the Mussel-Aa-kanaal and the Ruiten-Aa-kanaal in the south, crosses the west of Bellingwedde from south to north.

== Governance ==
The municipal building is located at the Hoofdweg in Wedde.

A municipal government in the Netherlands consists of the executive college of the mayor and aldermen and the elected municipal council. 

Janneke Snijder-Hazelhoff of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, appointed in 2013, was the last mayor of Bellingwedde.

The municipal council had 13 members. In the 2014 election, the last prior to merger, turnout was 57.57% with 4,191 valid votes. The results are shown in the table below: A coalition was formed between the Labour Party (PvdA), the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). All three parties had one alderman in the college of mayor and aldermen. Although the Socialist Party got the most votes, it is not part of the coalition.

<text>Homer is a village in Calhoun County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is part of the Battle Creek, Michigan Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,575 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Milton Barney arrived from Lyons, New York the summer of 1832 to scout the area and returned that September with his family and workmen to settle on the south bank of the Kalamazoo River in Section 5. Soon after Barney hired Osha Wilder to layout the plat for the village of Barneyville on the SW corner of Section 5, SE corner of Section 6, NE corner of Section 7, and NW corner of Section 8. For more a detailed history of the surrounding area see the entry for Homer Township and Clarendon Township.

Milton Barney built a store, a sawmill, and a hotel. In 1834 when a post office was registered, Barneyville was renamed Homer after the village in Cortland County, New York, at the request of many of the residents who had moved from there. Homer was incorporated as a village in 1871.

According to Dr William Lane, the Potawatomi natives were friendly and the children of settlers and natives often played together. Chief Ne-au-to-beer-saw, called Leather-nose, and Chief Wopkezike are mentioned in many stories of the founding era. The native population was numerous until the autumn of 1840 when the U.S. Government forcibly removed the Indians to reserves west of the Mississippi under Authority of the Indian Removal Act and 1833 Treaty of Chicago. Because of the peacefulness of the Potawatomi, they continued to co-exist with the settlers many years after the Treaty of Chicago until General Brady removed about 250 Indians of Hillsdale and Homer to Miami County, KS. Chief Ne-au-to-beer-saw drowned while crossing the Detroit River returning from his escape to Canada.

The &quot;old&quot; Homer mills was built by a stock company of Milton Barney, Walter Wright, Nelson D. Skeeles, Asabel Finch, Jr, and Mr Platt in 1837–1838. This structure was later operated under the name Smith, Lewis, &amp; Redfield. The property passed on to B. &amp; E.R. Smith in 1860 and to Judge Emons of Detroit in 1872. This original structure burned on January 25, 1886. The heirs of Judge Emons sold the water power, land, and mill site to Cortright &amp; Sons.

The Homer High School varsity baseball team set the national record for most consecutive wins at 75. The streak started at the start of the 2004 season and ended in the state championship game in 2005. From 2003 to 2006 the varsity baseball team compiled a 143–6 record. Winning two state championships, in 2004 and 2006, and was televised on ESPN&#x27;s 50 States in 50 Days segment on the state of Michigan.

In the early morning of May 16, 2010, the &quot;new&quot; Homer mills, a local landmark, burned to the ground. The fire is estimated to be the biggest fire in the town&#x27;s history since the high school burned down in 1943. The fire was so intense that the Homer Fire Department requested and received the aid of the fire departments of Albion, Albion Township, Sheridan Township, Marengo Township, Fredonia Township, Litchfield, and Concord. Fire trucks had to patrol the town, as ashes were raining down and posed the threat of setting houses on fire. The cause of the fire is unknown.

<text>Homer Township is a civil township of Calhoun County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is part of the Battle Creek, Michigan Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,896 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

===The first European settlers===
The first permanent settlers were from Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. Powell Grover, William Wintersteen, Richard McMutrie, and Henry McMurtrie walked from Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, arriving in the Homer area in April 1832. Powell Grover&#x27;s group lived their first year in an abandoned log cabin located in Section 11 of present-day Homer Township, said to be the former residence of Potawatomi native Chief Ne-au-to-beer-saw, while the settlers built their own cabins. Grover also built a saw mill on the north bank of the Kalamazoo River in Section 11. The plains where Grover and his friends homesteaded was known as the Pennsylvania Settlement.

Milton Barney arrived from Lyons, New York, the summer of 1832 to scout the area and returned that September with his family and workmen to settle on the south bank of the Kalamazoo River in Section 5. Soon afterwards Barney hired Osha Wilder to layout the plat for the village of Barneyville on the southwest corner of Section 5, southeast corner of Section 6, northeast corner of Section 7, and northwest corner of Section 8. This was the beginning of the village of Homer.

In 1834, the territorial legislature divided the area into townships of squares . The township in lower Calhoun County was named Homer due to the influence of James Hopkins and many other settlers from Homer, Cortland County, New York. This first township was later divided into the townships of Albion, Clarendon, Eckford, and Homer—each squares.

===The Native Americans===
According to Dr William Lane, the Potawatomi natives were friendly, and the children of settlers and natives often played together. Chief Ne-au-to-beer-saw, called &quot;Leather-nose&quot;, and Chief Wopkezike, lesser chiefs of the Baw Beese band of Potawatomi, are mentioned in many stories of the founding era. The native population was numerous until the U.S. government forcibly removed the Indians to reserves west of the Mississippi under authority of the Indian Removal Act and 1833 Treaty of Chicago. Because of the peacefulness of the Potawatomi, they continued to co-exist with the settlers for many years after the Removal Act, until the autumn of 1840 when General Hugh Brady removed about 250 Indians of Hillsdale County and Homer to Miami County, Kansas, in reaction to homesteader complaints to the Van Buren administration. Chief Ne-au-to-beer-saw drowned while crossing the Detroit River returning from his escape to Canada.
