<doc id="125031" wikidata="Q1087169" url="?curid=125031" title="Fort Dix">
<text>Fort Dix, the common name for the Army Support Activity (ASA) located at Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst, is a United States Army post. It is located south-southeast of Trenton, New Jersey. Fort Dix is under the jurisdiction of the Air Force Air Mobility Command. As of the 2020 U.S. census, Fort Dix census-designated place (CDP) had a total population of 7,716, of which 5,951 were in New Hanover Township, 1,765 were in Pemberton Township, and none were in Springfield Township (though portions of the CDP are included there).

Established in 1917, Fort Dix was in 2009 combined with adjoining U.S. Air Force and Navy facilities to become Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL) in 2009. However, it remains commonly known as &quot;Fort Dix&quot;, &quot;ASA Dix&quot;, or &quot;Dix&quot;.

During 2015 to 2016, Colonel Shelley Balderson was commander, making her the first female commander of Fort Dix in the base&#x27;s century-long history.

==Overview==

Fort Dix was established on 16 July 1917, as Camp Dix, named in honor of Major General John Adams Dix, a veteran of the War of 1812 and the American Civil War, and a former U.S. Senator, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, and Governor of New York. Camp Dix was home to the 153rd Depot Brigade. The role of World War I depot brigades was to receive recruits and draftees, then organize them and provide them with uniforms, equipment, and initial military training. Depot brigades also received soldiers returning home at the end of the war and carried out their mustering out and discharges.

Dix has a history of mobilizing, training, and demobilizing soldiers from as early as World War I through April 2015, when Fort Bliss and Fort Hood in Texas assumed full responsibility for that mission. In 1978, the first female recruits entered basic training at Fort Dix. In 1991, Dix trained Kuwaiti civilians in basic military skills so they could take part in their country&#x27;s liberation.

Dix ended its active U.S. Army training mission in 1991 due to Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommendations, which ended its command by a two-star general. Presently, it serves as a joint training site for all military components and all services.

In 2009, Fort Dix and the adjacent Air Force and Naval facilities were consolidated into a single secure facility, called Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. The supporting component is the U.S. Air Force, and base operations are executed by the 87th Air Base Wing, which provides installation management to all of the joint base while both the Navy and Army retain command and control of their missions, personnel, equipment, and component-specific services. Neither the Navy nor the Army base is subordinate to the Joint Base; each is simply supported by the joint base in base operations such as utilities, child-care centers, gyms, and other services, but each one reports through its own service-specific command chain and has its own commander (the Navy a captain and the Army a colonel). The commanders of both Fort Dix and Lakehurst serve also as deputy joint base commanders.

==Units assigned==
* 1st Brigade, Atlantic Training Division, 84th Training Command
* 99th Readiness Division
* 174th Infantry Brigade
* 305th Aerial Port Squadron 
* Fleet Logistics Squadron (VR-64)
* Marine Aircraft Group 49
* Military Entrance Processing Station
* Navy Operational Support Center
* NCO Academy
* United States Air Force Expeditionary Center
* USCG Atlantic Strike Team

==History==

:&quot;See footnote&quot;

Construction began in June 1917. Camp Dix, as it was known at the time, was a training and staging ground for units during World War I. Though the camp was an embarkation camp for the New York Port of Embarkation, it did not fall under the direct control of that command, with the War Department retaining direct jurisdiction. The camp became a demobilization center after the war. Between the World Wars, Camp Dix was a reception, training, and discharge center for the Civilian Conservation Corps. Camp Dix became Fort Dix on 8 March 1939, and the installation became a permanent Army post. During and after World War II, the fort served the same purpose as in the First World War, serving as a training and staging ground during the war and a demobilization center after the war.

After victory in Europe, arrangements were made to return prisoners of war to their home countries. 154 Soviet citizens who had been captured in German uniform were brought from Camp Ruston in Louisiana to Fort Dix in preparation for their return. On 29 June 1945, having learned of the plan, they rioted, attempting to provoke their guards to shoot them. Three hanged themselves. Seven proved they were not Soviet citizens, and the rest were shipped out on 31 August.

On 15 July 1947, Fort Dix became a basic-training center and the home of the 9th Infantry Division. In 1954, the 9th moved out and the 69th Infantry Division made the fort home until it was deactivated on 16 March 1956. During the Vietnam War, rapid expansion took place. A mock Vietnamese village was constructed, and soldiers received Vietnam-specific training before being deployed. Since Vietnam, Fort Dix has sent soldiers to Operation Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

===U.S. Coast Guard site===
The Atlantic Strike Team (AST) of the U.S. Coast Guard is based at Fort Dix. As part of the Department of Homeland Security, the AST is responsible for responding to oil-pollution and hazardous-materials release incidents to protect public health and the environment.

===Federal Correctional Institution===
Fort Dix is also home to Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution, the largest single federal prison. It is a low-security installation for male inmates located within the military installation. As of 19 November 2009, it housed 4,310 inmates, and a minimum-security satellite camp housed an additional 426.

==Mission realignment==
Knowing that Fort Dix was on a base closure list, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) attempted to save the U.S. Army post during 1987. The USAF moved the Security Police (SP) Air Base Ground Defense school from Camp Bullis, Texas, to Dix in fall 1987. Putting 50–100 SP trainees on a commercial flight from San Antonio, Texas, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, every few weeks was eventually realized to be not cost effective, so the school was later moved back to Camp Bullis.

Fort Dix was an early casualty of the first base realignment and closure process in the early 1990s, after having lost its traditional basic-training mission, but advocates attracted Army Reserve interest in keeping the post as a training reservation. With the reserves, and millions of dollars for improvements, Fort Dix has grown again to employ 3,000. As many as 15,000 troops train there on weekends, and the post has been a major mobilization point for reserve and National Guard troops since the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.

Fort Dix has completed its realignment from an individual training center to a FORSCOM Power Projection Platform for the Northeastern United States under the command and control of the Army&#x27;s Installation Management Command. Primary missions include training and providing regional base operations support to on-post and off-post active component and U.S. Army Reserve units, soldiers, families, and retirees. Fort Dix supported more than 1.1 million man-days of training in 1998. More than 13,500 persons, on average, live or work within the garrison and its tenant organizations. Devens Reserve Force Training Area in Massachusetts is a subinstallation of the ASA.

===2005 realignments===

In 2005, the US Department of Defense announced that Fort Dix would be affected by a base realignment and closure. For base operations support, it became part of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J. It was the first base of its kind in the United States and is the Department of Defense&#x27;s only three-service joint base. ASA, Fort Dix occupies and supports all training across 31,000 of the joint base&#x27;s 42,000 acres.

==Attack plots==

===1970===

In 1970, the Weather Underground planned to detonate a nail bomb at a noncommissioned officers&#x27; dance at the base to &quot;bring the war home&quot; and &quot;give the United States and the rest of the world a sense that this country was going to be completely unlivable if the United States continued in Vietnam.&quot; The plot failed the morning of the dance, when a bomb under construction exploded at the group&#x27;s Greenwich Village, New York City, townhouse, killing three members of the group.

===2007===

On 8 May 2007, six individuals, mostly ethnic Albanian Muslims, were arrested for plotting an attack against Fort Dix and the soldiers within. The men are believed to be Islamic radicals who may have been inspired by the ideologies of al-Qaeda. The men allegedly planned to storm the base with automatic weapons in an attempt to kill as many soldiers as possible. The men faced charges of conspiracy to kill U.S. soldiers.

==1969 stockade riot==
On 5 June 1969, 250 men imprisoned in the military stockade rioted. The prisoners called it a rebellion and cited grievances including &quot;unsanitary conditions&quot;, overcrowding, starvation, beatings, being chained to chairs, forced confessions and participation in an unjust war. The Army initially called it a &quot;disturbance&quot; caused by a small number of &quot;instigators&quot; and &quot;troublemakers&quot;, but soon charged 38 soldiers with riot and inciting to riot. The antiwar movement, which had been increasingly recognizing and supporting resistance to the war within the military, quickly moved to defend the rebels/rioters and those the Army singled out for punishment. Soon the slogan &quot;Free the Fort Dix 38&quot; was heard in antiwar speeches, written about in underground newspapers and leaflets, and demonstrations were planned.

Due to public backlash against the military&#x27;s treatment of the prisoners, only five of the original 38 were brought before a general court-marital on serious charges. Most had their charges dropped entirely, while nine faced a special court-martial, the military equivalent of misdemeanor court. Four of those were convicted of misdemeanor participation in a riot and the other five acquitted. Of the five singled out for general courts-martial, one was acquitted completely while four were discharged with varying sentences including hard labor.

==&quot;Ultimate Weapon&quot; monument==
In 1957, during their leisure hours, Specialist 4 Steven Goodman, assisted by PFC Stuart Scherr, made a small clay model of a charging infantryman. Their tabletop model was spotted by a public-relations officer, who brought it to the attention of Deputy Post Commander Bruce Clarke, who suggested the construction of a larger statue to serve as a symbol of Fort Dix. Goodman and Scherr, who had studied industrial arts together in New York City and were classified by the Army as illustrators, undertook the project under the management of Sergeant Major Bill Wright. Operating on a limited budget, and using old railroad track, Bondo, and other available items, they created a 12-foot figure of a charging infantryman in full battle dress, representing no particular race or ethnicity.

By 1988, years of weather had taken a toll on the statue, and a restoration campaign raised over $100,000. Under the auspices of Goodman and the Fort Dix chapter of the Association of the United States Army, the statue was recast in bronze and its concrete base was replaced by black granite.

The statue stands 25 feet tall at the entrance to Infantry Park. Its inscription reads
==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Fort Dix had a total area of 10.389 square miles (26.909 km2), of which 0.127 square mile (0.329 km2) is covered by water (1.22%).

=== Climate ===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, Fort Dix has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 7,716 people, 784 households, and 590 families in the CDP. The population density was . There were 898 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup was 52.57% (4,056) White, 34.47% (2,660) Black or African American, 0.67% (52) Native American, 1.91% (147) Asian, 0.30% (23) Pacific Islander, 6.07% (468) from other races, and 4.02% (310) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 21.47% (1,657) of the population.

Of the 784 households, 59.1% had children under the age of 18; 63.8% were married couples living together; 8.7% had a female householder with no husband present and 24.7% were non-families. Of all households, 15.1% were made up of individuals and 0.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.05 and the average family size was 3.56.

12.1% of the population were under the age of 18, 4.2% from 18 to 24, 50.2% from 25 to 44, 30.9% from 45 to 64, and 2.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38.9 years. For every 100 females, the population had 522.8 males. For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 757.5 males.

==Transportation==
New Jersey Route 68 links Fort Dix to U.S. Route 206 near the latter&#x27;s interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike, U.S. Route 130, and Interstate 295. New Jersey Transit provides service to and from Philadelphia on the 317 route.

==Education==
The U.S. Census Bureau lists &quot;Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst&quot; in Burlington County as having its own school district. Students attend area school district public schools, as the Department of Defense Education Activity does not operate any schools on that base. Students on McGuire and Dix may attend one of the following in their respective grade levels, with all siblings in a family taking the same choice: North Hanover Township School District (PK-6), Northern Burlington County Regional School District (7-12), and Pemberton Township School District (K-12).

The Pemberton district operates Fort Dix Elementary School, located on-post.

In prior years, Pemberton was the sole school district for Fort Dix. In 1988, 23% of the students in that district were from military families. In 1997, plans were made to shift the students, numbering around 700, to North Hanover schools. Pemberton school officials were against that move.

==Pop-culture references==
Fort Dix is the home base setting in Cinemaware&#x27;s 1988 C64 and Nintendo video game &quot;Rocket Ranger&quot;; the game is based on an alternate World War II scenario, wherein the Nazis discover lunarium, which could allow them to win the war unless a young American scientist stops them.

<text>Lumberton is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 12,803, an increase of 244 (+1.9%) from the 2010 census count of 12,559, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,098 (+20.1%) from the 10,461 counted in the 2000 census.

Lumberton was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 14, 1860, from portions of Medford, Southampton and Eastampton townships. Portions of Lumberton were taken on March 12, 1924, to form Hainesport Township. Named for its early lumber industry, the township supplied Philadelphia with wood from harvested pitch pines.

In March 2007, Lumberton was identified as having the most active community of eBay buyers and sellers on a per-capita basis in the United States, with 46,000 items posted on the site over a three-week period by members based in the Lumberton ZIP code 08048.

==History==
The Lenape Native Americans were the earliest inhabitants in what is now known as Lumberton. By the 17th century, European colonists began to settle the southwestern part of the township. They cleared wooded areas and established farms centered around Fostertown, an unincorporated community. Eayrestown was founded by Richard and Elizabeth Eayres in the late 1600s and became the first significant settlement in the area. It also served as the center of commerce, thanks to its sawmill. The village of Lumberton emerged from these two neighboring communities.

The history of some homes in Lumberton can be traced back to the times of slavery. The township&#x27;s earliest settlers and their descendants held various views on slavery. These perspectives varied from supporting and tolerating it to passive and active opposition. Over the years, many locals became advocates for the abolition of slavery, first in New Jersey, and then across the entire nation.

One notable historical site is a house on Creek Road. Built in 1824 by D.B. Cole, a descendant of the founders of Old Colestown, New Jersey, this house played a crucial part in the Underground Railroad. The property&#x27;s deed dates back to 1806 when the Coles bought it from the Moores of Moorestown. Charles Blockson&#x27;s &quot;Hippocrene Guide to the Underground Railroad&quot; documents that a fake well in the backyard once served as a refuge for enslaved people. They would slide down into it to hide from their masters as they made their way to Canada.

During the Cold War, the town served as a site for Project Nike. In the event of a nuclear war, Nike Ajax and Hercules missiles would have been deployed from bases in Lumberton and other neighboring bases. This strategy aimed to deter the Soviet Union from bombing the Delaware Valley.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 13.01 square miles (33.71 km2), including 12.88 square miles (33.37 km2) of land and 0.13 square miles (0.34 km2) of water (1.01%).

The township borders the Burlington County municipalities of Eastampton, Hainesport, Medford, Mount Holly, Mount Laurel, and Southampton.

<doc id="125034" wikidata="Q1087192" url="?curid=125034" title="Marlton, New Jersey">
<text>Marlton is a census-designated place (CDP) located within Evesham Township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP had a population of 10,594 residents, reflecting a 4.5% increase from the 10,133 enumerated at the 2010 U.S. Census, in turn a 1.2% decrease from the 10,260 counted in the 2000 census.

While Marlton comprises only a small part of Evesham Township, many people colloquially refer to the entire township as Marlton.

==History==
Marlton was founded by Welsh and English farmers beginning in 1676. The name Marlton first appeared in the early 19th century. The name is derived from marl clay, which is commonly found in the local soil. The discovery of the marl content helped local business and farmers, and caused the first &quot;building boom&quot;, occurring in the 1830s and 1840s.

<doc id="125035" wikidata="Q10860392" url="?curid=125035" title="McGuire Air Force Base">
<text>McGuire AFB/McGuire, the common name of the McGuire unit of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, is a United States Air Force base in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, approximately south-southeast of Trenton. McGuire is under the jurisdiction of the Air Mobility Command. It was consolidated with two adjoining US Army and Navy facilities to become part of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JB MDL) on 1 October 2009.

The McGuire Air Force Base census-designated place (CDP) is located in portions of both New Hanover Township and North Hanover Township. As of the 2020 United States census, the McGuire Air Force Base CDP had a total population of 4,522.

==Overview==
The host unit at McGuire AFB is the 87th Air Base Wing (87 ABW), United States Air Force Expeditionary Center, AMC. The 87 ABW provides installation management to all of JB MDL. The wing also provides mission-ready, expeditionary Airmen to support Unified Combatant Commanders in ongoing military operations. The wing consists of more than 3,100 officers, enlisted, and civilian personnel from the Air Force, Army and Navy. The 87th Air Base Wing is commanded by Colonel Bridget V. Gigliotti. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Tony B. Jenkins.

McGuire originated in 1941 as Fort Dix Army Airfield. Closed briefly after World War II, it reopened in 1948 as McGuire Air Force Base. The base was named after Major Thomas B. McGuire Jr., Medal of Honor recipient, and the second leading ace in American history.

March 3, 1960, while returning home from his army stint, Elvis Presley landed on McGuire Airforce Base, en route from Frankfurt, Germany and Glasgow Prestwick Airport, Prestwick, Scotland and Ernest Harmon Air Force Base, Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.
Here he disembarked the airplane, two days before his army discharge.

==Units==
The 305th Air Mobility Wing, 108th Air Refueling Wing (ANG), 621st Contingency Response Wing, and the 514th Air Mobility Wing (AFRC), has supported every major type of air mobility mission over the past 15 years. The following units are assigned to McGuire AFB:
* 87th Air Base Wing
* 305th Air Mobility Wing
* 514th Air Mobility Wing (AFRC)
* 108th Air Refueling Wing (New Jersey ANG)
* Marine Aircraft Group 49 (MAG-49) (U.S. Marine Corps Reserve / 4th Marine Aircraft Wing)
* Marine Helicopter Light Attack Squadron 773 (HMLA-773) (U.S. Marine Corps Reserve / MAG-49)
* Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 64 (VR-64) (U.S. Navy Reserve)

McGuire is the only base in both the Air Mobility Command and the entire U.S. Air Force hosting three AMC-gained flying wings of the Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard.

McGuire is also host to:
*United States Air Force Expeditionary Center (USAF EC)—physically located on Fort Dix
*621st Contingency Response Wing (CRW)
*373rd Training Squadron (373 TRS), Detachment 1
*AMC Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES)

McGuire hosts the flying needs of its mission partners on JB MDL. Air Force and civilian AMC-contracted aircraft use McGuire&#x27;s two runways to facilitate this mission. Many hundreds of thousands of Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel have left the United States for overseas locations from McGuire AFB.

Airplanes from McGuire have provided the flyovers for Philadelphia Eagles games and Major League Baseball All-Star and World Series games played in Philadelphia at the end of the National Anthem. These same planes were also responsible for the Super Bowl XLVIII flyover and missing-man formation which came at the end of opera star Renee Fleming&#x27;s rendition of the National Anthem.

==History==

===Major Thomas Buchanan McGuire, Jr===
McGuire Air Force Base was established as Fort Dix Airport in 1937 and first opened to military aircraft on 9 January 1941. On 13 January 1948 the United States Air Force renamed the facility McGuire Air Force Base in honor of Major Thomas Buchanan McGuire Jr., (1920–1945). Medal of Honor recipient and second place American flying ace of World War II, Major McGuire died on 7 January 1945 when his P-38 Lightning spun out of control and crashed on Negros Island in the Philippines as he attempted to aid his wingman during an aerial dogfight.

Flight operations to support Camp Dix at an adjacent airfield took place as early as 1926. Facilities and runways to support an air mission began in 1937 as a Civilian Conservation Corps project. This was on newly acquired land for the great Army Air Forces expansion approved by the Roosevelt Administration. This nascent airfield and wooden structures was named &quot;Rudd Field.&quot; To meet the requirements for a possible world war, Rudd Field was renamed Fort Dix Army Air Base in 1939, and underwent massive expansion from 1940 to 1941. Runways constructed consisted of three concrete surfaced, 7100x150(N/S), 7100x150(NE/SW), 5400x150(E/W), and one macadam surfaced, 8100x150(NW/SE).

The base had its first permanent Army Air Force occupant in November 1941 when the 59th Observation Group took up station on 14 November. Initially during 1941–42 the Group operated a wide range of aircraft, including the BC-1A, L-59, O-46, O-47, O-49 Vigilant, and O-52 Owl, engaging in antisubmarine patrols along the East coast.

After the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, Fort Dix Army Air Base was used as a training and facility for numerous service units under First Air Force. Once organized and prepared for overseas duty, these units provided support and technical sections for the group requirements as a whole: &quot;Flying control&quot;, &quot;Ordnance&quot;, &quot;airfield security&quot;, &quot;firefighting&quot;, &quot;Post Exchange&quot; (PX), &quot;Special Services&quot;, &quot;Mail&quot;, &quot;Transportation&quot; (&quot;motor pool&quot;), &quot;Communications&quot;, &quot;Radar&quot;, &quot;Gunnery instruction&quot;, &quot;Personal Equipment&quot;, and &quot;Weather&quot; (Meteorology). The service group also had its own mess section. The service group had approximately 30 officers and 300 to 400 enlisted men. This training continued until 1944.

In late 1942, Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (AAFASC) took up tenant status at Fort Dix AAB. The 378th Bombardment Group patrolled with a mission to search for German U-boats in the coastal waters of the Atlantic Coast and to fly aerial coverage of friendly convoys off the east coast with Douglas O-46 and North American O-47 light observation planes. In August 1943, this mission was turned over to the United States Navy.

Air Technical Service Command began using the base in 1943 overhauling, servicing and preparing aircraft for overseas shipment to North Africa and to the United Kingdom. This mission continued until the end of the war in 1945, then received returning aircraft from Europe and arranged their shipment to operational bases or to storage locations. Part of this mission was the temporary basing of returning combat (primarily bombardment) groups from the overseas combat theaters and, with the Army Service Forces coordinating their inactivation.

Fort Dix Army Air Base was phased down in the fall of 1945 and was placed on Temporary Inactive Status on 15 February 1945; which changed to Inactive Status on 1 March 1946. Jurisdiction of the base was transferred to Strategic Air Command at Andrews Field, Maryland on 1 August 1947, the base remaining in inactive status.

===United States Air Force===

====Strategic Air Command====
Fort Dix Army Air Base was taken out of inactive status and activated as a primary installation on 29 August 1948. Initially reactivated under Strategic Air Command, the facility underwent a modernization program to convert the World War II base into a base for postwar jet aircraft. In addition, support facilities were upgraded from World War II temporary wooden structures to permanent structures for long-term use.

SAC activated the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at the newly re-designated McGuire Air Force Base on 10 November 1948. The 91st SRW was a long-range photographic reconnaissance unit equipped with a mixture of RB-17 Flying Fortresses and RB-29 Superfortresses equipped with wide variety of photographic reconnaissance and mapping cameras in the bomb bays. It moved to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, on 1 October 1949.

====Air Defense Command====

With the departure of the 91st SRW, control of McGuire AFB was reassigned to Continental Air Command (ConAC). ConAC assigned the base to Air Defense Command (ADC), at the time an operating agency of ConAC. ADC took jurisdiction of the base on 1 January 1951 with its re-establishment as a separate major command.

The 52d Fighter Wing, All Weather was assigned to the base, being moved from Mitchel Field, Long Island on 4 October 1949. Equipped with very long-range F-82 Twin Mustangs, the 52d Fighter Group, All Weather engaged in interceptor training missions against SAC B-29 and B-50 Superfortress bombers simulating air defense missions against incoming Soviet Tupolev Tu-4 bombers. The 52d remained at McGuire until 6 February 1952, when it was inactivated along with the F-82s.

The Twin Mustangs of the 52d FW were replaced by the ADC 4709th Defense Wing on 1 February 1952. Under the Eastern Air Defense Force, the 4709th DW (later Air Defense Wing), controlled interceptor squadrons at McGuire, as well as at Suffolk County AFB and Stewart AFB, New York, and Dover AFB, Delaware. Interceptor squadrons stationed at McGuire were the 2d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and 5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. These were replaced in 1955 by the 332d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and 539th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.

These squadrons flew a variety of ADC interceptors in the 1950s, starting with the F-94 Starfire in 1952, upgrading to the F-84 Thunderjet in 1953, and finally the interceptor F-86D Sabre later in 1953.

Military Air Transport Service took over jurisdiction of McGuire AFB on 1 July 1954 and took over the flight line of McGuire in 1956, with the ADC interceptors being reassigned. Air Defense Command became a tenant organization on the base, with the 4709th ADW being re-designated as first the 4621st Air Defense Wing on 1 April 1956, and shortly afterwards as the New York Air Defense Sector (NYADS) on 1 October 1956 under the 26th Air Division.

The NYADS was in large part responsible for one of the foundational projects of the computer era: the development of the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) air defense system, from its first test at Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1951, to the installation of the first operational Data Center (DC-01) at McGuire AFB in 1957, becoming operational on 1 July 1958. The SAGE 
system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack.

Developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) engineers and scientists, SAGE monitored North American skies for possible attack by crewed aircraft and missiles for 25 years. The heart of the system, the AN/FSQ-7 computer, was the first computer to have an internal memory composed of &quot;magnetic cores,&quot; thousands of tiny ferrite rings that served as reversible electromagnets. SAGE also introduced computer-driven displays, online terminals, time sharing, high-reliability computation, digital signal processing, digital transmission over telephone lines, digital track-while-scan, digital simulation, computer networking, and duplex computing.

The NYADS was reassigned from 26th AD on 1 April 1966 to First Air Force, until 30 September 1968 when both the sector was inactivated along with DC-01, when budget restrictions along with when technology advances allowed the Air Force to shut down many SAGE Data Centers. The SAGE network, however, remained active until 1983.

In 1959, Air Defense Command deployed the CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missile to McGuire AFB. The Bomarc was the only surface-to-air missile ever deployed by the United States Air Force. All other U.S. land-based SAMs were and are under the control of the United States Army. The Bomarc site was located ESE of the main base in a separate facility, and was staffed by the 46th Air Defense Missile Squadron, activated on 1 January 1959. Two models of the Bomarc were deployed to McGuire, the liquid-fueled CIM-10A (28 missiles), and later the CIM-10B (56 missiles).

The supersonic Bomarc missiles were the first long-range anti-aircraft missiles in the world, and were equipped with a W40 nuclear warhead. The site at McGuire went operational in 1959 under the NYADS. Within a year of becoming operational, a Bomarc-A with a nuclear warhead caught fire on 7 June 1960 following the explosive rupture of its onboard helium tank. While the missile&#x27;s explosives didn&#x27;t detonate the heat melted the warhead, releasing plutonium which the fire crews then spread around. The Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission cleaned up the site and covered it with concrete; fortunately, this was the only major incident involving the weapons system.

The Bomarc site remained in operation under successor organizations after the inactivation of the NYADS. After its closure in 1972, the accident resulted in the site remaining off limits to the present day, primarily due to low levels of plutonium contamination. Due to the accident, the McGuire complex has never been sold or converted to other uses and remains in Air Force ownership, making it the most intact site of the eight in the United States. It has been nominated to the National Register of Historic Places.

With the closure of the Bomarc site, the by then renamed Aerospace Defense Command ended its activities at McGuire AFB. The large SAGE DC-01 blockhouse is now the headquarters of the 621st Contingency Response Wing and previously housed the 21st Air Force/Expeditionary Mobility Task Force.

====Strategic airlift====
On 1 July 1954, Military Air Transport Service (MATS) took over jurisdiction of McGuire Air Force Base. Through its successor organizations, Military Airlift Command (MAC) in 1966 and since 1992 as Air Mobility Command (AMC), the primary mission of McGuire has remained the strategic airlift of personnel and equipment worldwide.

MATS activities at the base began on 1 July 1954 with the 1611th Air Transport Wing being activated. The 1611th ATW flew primarily C-118 Liftmaster (Navy R6D) transports worldwide throughout its existence. It received C-135 Stratolifters in 1962 and was upgraded from a medium to a heavy transport wing. It supported Air Force Reserve associate units beginning in 1961. The wing also operated Aerial Port and Port of Embarkation for the Northeast United States, primarily for European flights. Tenant units of MATS (and later MAC) at McGuire were the Air Weather Service and Air Rescue Service squadrons.

On 1 June 1955, MATS moved the Eastern Transport Air Force (EASTAF) to McGuire from Westover AFB, Massachusetts when SAC and Eighth Air Force took over. EASTAF was one of three components of MATS worldwide airlift force, controlling all Air Force strategic airlift operations between the Mississippi River and the east coast of Africa and in Central and South America.

On 1 January 1966 MATS was discontinued and its assets were assigned to the new Military Airlift Command (MAC). The 1611th ATW was discontinued and its mission taken over by the 438th Military Airlift Wing. EASTAF was re-designated as the 21st Air Force. 21st AF continued the mission of EASTAF, controlling MAC airlift wings at Dover AFB, Delaware and Charleston AFB, South Carolina and well as McGuire. Depending upon command organization at different times, airlift and airlift support units in Europe, the Azores, Bermuda and throughout the southeastern United States also reported to 21st AF.

The 438th MAW completed the replacement of the prop-driven transports of MATS with the new Lockheed C-141 Starlifter. For the next 30 years, the 438th MAW and transported military cargo, mail and passengers worldwide, particularly in the Eastern United States, Atlantic, European and Mediterranean areas, with frequent special missions to the Arctic, the Antarctic, South America, the Far East, and to Southeast Asia combat areas during the Vietnam War.

From 1967, McGuire was the best-known C-141 Starlifter base in the world, possessing up to a quarter of MAC&#x27;s fleet of that aircraft until its retirement in 1994. On 1 December 1991, the wing was redesignated as the 438th Airlift Wing and implemented the objective wing organization. On 1 June 1992, it was assigned to the new Air Mobility Command.

====Modern era====
On 1 October 1994, the 438th Airlift Wing was inactivated, being replaced at McGuire by the 305th Air Mobility Wing which was transferred from Grissom AFB, Indiana when Grissom was realigned via BRAC action to the Air Force Reserve Command. The C-141 was retired in 2004, being replaced by the C-17 Globemaster III.

The 21st Air Force, coupled with the stand up of the 621st Air Mobility Operations Group (621 AMOG) and its later reorganization to the 621st Contingency Response Wing (621 CRW), partnered with the 305 AMW and spearheaded virtually every contingency over the past 14 years, from Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR in the Balkans to Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. McGuire itself, through its support organizations, has also been a key component in the transport of materials and personnel to global crisis points.

In 1999, McGuire served as the lead staging base for the evacuation of Kosovo refugees in Operation OPEN ARMS; McGuire was the rally and staging point for FEMA operations in New York City after the 11 September 2001 attacks; in 2005, the base lent key support for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

On 1 October 2003 the Twenty-First Air Force was re-designated as the 21st Expeditionary Mobility Task Force, reflecting its expanded mission due to the outbreak of the Global War on Terrorism. In 2006, McGuire AFB hosted over 1,800 Lebanese Americans evacuated from the battles there between Israel and Hezbollah insurgents. In 2008, McGuire assumed responsibility for the no-fail &quot;Red Ball Express&quot; aerial port mission, supplying efforts in ENDURING FREEDOM.

Today the men and women of McGuire AFB continue to be at the forefront of operations, with regular deployments of airlift and aerial refueling aircraft as well as support elements for combat operations. McGuire hosted a rapidly assembled STRATCOM Joint Task Force satellite recovery team with no prior notice in February 2008, winning praise for its flexibility and support. Team McGuire remains engaged in providing direct combat support to two regional conflicts and provided personnel, resources and aircraft.

Due to a Department of Defense (DoD) initiative, McGuire will be the lead service in the first tri-service Joint super-base, combining its infrastructure support with the support of Fort Dix (Army) and Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst (Navy). Additionally, the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) identified several units to be added to Team McGuire over the next few years, including contingents from every service branch. Construction of many new facilities, a beautification effort, and new privately owned contract family housing, make McGuire one of the premier Air Force installations.

==Education==
The U.S. Census Bureau lists &quot;Joint Base MDL’s McGuire AFB and Fort Dix&quot; in Burlington County as having its own school district. Students attend area school district public schools, as the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) does not operate any schools on that base. Students on McGuire and Dix may attend one of the following for their respective grade levels, with all siblings in a family taking the same choice: North Hanover Township School District (PK-6), Northern Burlington County Regional School District (7–12), and Pemberton Township School District (K-12).

In 1997 the North Hanover schools were the only choice for McGuire AFB dependents.

Two North Hanover district schools are located on the base and two are in Jacobstown. As of the 2014–15 school year, the district and its four schools had an enrollment of 1,230 students and 112.8 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.9:1. It is the largest K-6 school district in Burlington County. Schools in the district (with 2014–15 school enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Discovery Elementary School (grades PreK-K; 294 students) in McGuire AFB
Atlantis Elementary School (1–2; 236) in McGuire AFB
Clarence B. Lamb Elementary School (1–4; 425) in Jacobstown and 
Upper Elementary School School (5–6; 272) in Jacobstown.

Northern Burlington County Regional School District students are served from Chesterfield Township, Mansfield Township, North Hanover Township and Springfield Township, along with children of USAF personnel based at McGuire AFB. The schools in the district (with 2014–15 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are
Northern Burlington County Regional Middle School for grades 7 and 8 (758 students) and
Northern Burlington County Regional High School for grades 9–12 (1,355 students).

==Transportation==
New Jersey Route 68 links the base to U.S. Route 206 near the latter&#x27;s interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike, U.S. Route 130 and Interstate 195. 
New Jersey Transit provides service to and from Philadelphia on the 317 route.

<doc id="125036" wikidata="Q1072712" url="?curid=125036" title="Moorestown, New Jersey">
<text>Moorestown is a township in Burlington County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is an eastern suburb of Philadelphia and geographically part of the South Jersey region of the state. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 21,355, an increase of 629 (+3.0%) from the 2010 census count of 20,726, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,709 (+9.0%) from the 19,017 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Moorestown was authorized to be incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 11, 1922, from portions of Chester Township (now Maple Shade Township), subject to the approval of voters in the affected area in a referendum. Voters approved the creation on April 25, 1922. The township is named for a Thomas Moore who settled in the area in 1722 and constructed a hotel though other sources attribute the name to poet Thomas Moore.

Chester Township had banned all liquor sales in 1915, and Moorestown retained the restrictions for more than 70 years after Prohibition ended in 1933. Referendums aiming to repeal the ban failed in both 1935 and 1953. In 2007, the township council approved a referendum that would allow the sale by auction of six liquor licenses (the state limit of one per every 3,000 residents), with estimates that each license could sell over $1 million each. The referendum did not receive enough votes to pass. In 2011, voters repealed the liquor ban; however, liquor sales in the township will be restricted to the Moorestown Mall.

In 2005, Moorestown was ranked number one in &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 best places to live in America. The magazine screened over a thousand small towns and created a list of the top 100 for its August 2005 issue, in which Moorestown earned the top spot.

==History==

Main Street is located along a ridge historically occupied by the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. Two natural springs, one to the west (off Main Street before reaching the Perkins Center for the Arts, just by Roberts Elementary School) and one to the east (off North Stanwick Road) drew Native Americans and traders to the area.

In 1682, John and Sarah Roberts became the first English-speaking residents of Moorestown when they established their home. Their residence is now marked by the Roberts Monument at the intersection of County Route 537 and Route 73. In May 1686, three years after the founding of Philadelphia, John Rodman bought on the west side of Chester Township, and Thomas Rodman bought in the same area; this soon became known as the Village of Rodmantown. The growing area around the eastern spring was known as the Village of Chestertown.

In 1700, the first Society of Friends&#x27; Meeting House, built of logs, was erected on the King&#x27;s Highway. Originally known as &quot;Meeting House Lane,&quot; Chester Avenue was laid out in 1720. The community at that time probably consisted of a few farmhouses along the King&#x27;s Highway from Stanwick Road to Locust Street.

Thomas Moore and his wife Elizabeth settled here in 1722. In 1732, Moore purchased of land on the north side of the King&#x27;s Highway. The land ran from the west side of the Friends&#x27; graveyard on the northwest corner of the King&#x27;s Highway and Meeting House Lane on the east, and west to Locust Street on the western boundary of his property and north to Second Street. Moore set up a hotel on the northwest corner of the King&#x27;s Highway and Union streets (Cornerstone Bank and the Wawa now occupy opposite corners there). Given Moore&#x27;s extensive property ownership, the name Moorestown gradually replaced Chester informally in the center of town. Finally, Moorestown formerly split off from Chester and became a Township.

The Coles Hotel, east of the corner of Main and Chester, was a stop on the stagecoach route connecting Camden with Trenton and Philadelphia. Construction of the railroad in 1867 superseded the stagecoaches and connected Mount Holly Township and Camden.

A tavern built in 1745 by John Cox at what is now Main and Schooley streets was taken over in 1778 during the Revolutionary War by Hessian officers retreating from Philadelphia. In the years after the war, it was used for a town hall before 1812, when what is now called &quot;Old Town Hall&quot; was constructed.

A house constructed in 1742 by John Cowperthwaite at King&#x27;s Highway and Lenola Road is listed in the Library of Congress with details of the house recorded in 1937 by the Historic American Buildings Survey of the United States Department of the Interior.

Quakers built Moorestown&#x27;s first two schools in 1785. A brick schoolhouse was located near what is now the intersection of Route 73 and the Kings Highway overpass. A stone schoolhouse was located adjacent to the present Friends Meeting House at the intersection of Chester Avenue and Main Street. The first district school was opened in 1810. The first free Moorestown public school was established in 1873.

Vernon Hill&#x27;s mansion &quot;Villa Collina&quot;—Italian for &quot;Hill House&quot;—the largest private residence in New Jersey, is located in Moorestown.

Moorestown&#x27;s Quaker heritage is discussed in Moorestown resident and native historian William H. Kingston&#x27;s book, &quot;Moorestown&#x27;s Third Century: The Quaker Legacy&quot;.

==Government==

===Local government===

Moorestown&#x27;s municipal government operates within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under Council-Manager plan E, which was implemented as of January 1, 1967, based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission. This form of government is used in 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide. The Township Council is comprised of five members, who are elected at-large in partisan elections to four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election in even-numbered years. At a reorganization meeting held in January after each election, the council selects a mayor and a deputy mayor from among its members. The township manager, a full-time professional administrator, is appointed by the council. Under the township&#x27;s administrative code and the Faulkner Act, the manager has the township&#x27;s executive and administrative authority and responsibility. The township manager is Kevin Aberant.

, the Moorestown Township Council includes Mayor Quinton Law (D, term on committee ends December 31, 2026; term as mayor ends 2025), Deputy mayor Sue Mammarella (D, term on committee ends 2028; term as deputy mayor ends 2025), James A. Barry (D, 2028), Nicole Gillespie (D, 2026) and Christopher Keating (D, 2028).

In 2004, Moorestown elected a majority Democratic council for the first time in its history. In 2008, the Moorestown Republicans won back three seats, giving them a 4–1 majority starting in 2009. On Election Day 2012, Republicans Victoria Napolitano (5,580 votes), and Phil Garwood (5,467 votes), along with Democrat J. Greg Newcomer (5,345 votes), won election to the three open seats on the township council, outpacing Republican Pete Palko (5,321 votes) and Democrats Brian Sattinger (4,899 votes) and Mark Hines (4,869 votes). Republicans maintained a 4–1 majority, and Stacey Jordan was sworn in as Moorestown&#x27;s first female mayor on January 7, 2013.

During summer 2007, the township hall suffered smoke and water damage caused by an electrical fire. The township offices were temporarily located at 2 Executive Place, Moorestown Township with council meetings held during that time at the William Allen Middle School Auditorium and court sessions are conducted in Maple Shade. On December 10, 2012, Town Council members John Button, Greg Gallo, Stacey Jordan, Chris Chiacchio, and Mike Testa, along with Councilmembers-elect Victoria Napolitano and Greg Newcomer, broke ground on the new Town Hall, which was completed in 2014 

In the 2014 elections, Stacey Jordan was re-elected to council along with her Republican running mate, Manny Delgado, who made history by becoming Moorestown&#x27;s first Hispanic Councilman when he took office in January 2015. During the same reorganization meeting, Victoria Napolitano became Moorestown&#x27;s youngest mayor ever at the age of 26, and may also be the youngest female to ever hold the office of mayor statewide.

In December 2015, the township council selected Lisa Petriello from three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in 2016 that was vacated by Greg Newcomer when he left office the previous month.

In November 2016, Republican incumbent Victoria Napolitano won re-election along with her Republican running mate Mike Locatell and Democrat Lisa Petriello, continuing the Republican Party&#x27;s 4-to-1 majority. At the township&#x27;s January 2017 reorganization meeting, Manny Delgado was elected by his peers as Moorestown&#x27;s first Hispanic mayor.

In 2018, the township had an average property tax bill of $11,241, the highest in the county, compared to an average bill of $8,767 statewide. That year, Democrats Nicole Gillespie and Brian Donnelly defeated Republican incumbent Manny Delgado and Jamie Boren, giving Democrats control of council for the second time in history. At the council&#x27;s reorganization meeting in January, 2019 Lisa Petriello was elected by her peers as mayor, with Nicole Gillespie serving as deputy mayor.

In January 2020, Nicole Gillespie was elected mayor and Brian Donnelly as deputy mayor. On November 3, 2020 Democrats Sue Mammarella, Dave Zipin and Jake VanDyken made history by defeating three Republican opponents to give Democrats the first ever 5-0 majority on Moorestown council beginning in January, 2021.

In January 2021, the Township Council unanimously elected Nicole Gillespie as mayor for a 2-year term, Sue Mammarella as deputy mayor, and selected Quinton Law to fill the seat expiring in December 2022 that had been held by Brian Donnelly until he resigned from office. The appointment made Law the youngest and the first Black councilmember in township history. Law served on an interim basis until the November 2021 general election, when he was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

In January 2022, Nicole Gillespie was re-elected to a second term on council and Quinton Law was elected to a full term, retaining the Democrat&#x27;s 5-0 majority.

In January 2023, Nicole Gillespie and Quinton Law were unanimously elected as mayor and deputy mayor by their peers. In December of 2023, Jake Van Dyken resigned from Moorestown council for personal reasons, and the remaining councilmembers unanimously appointed Christopher Keating to fill the unexpired term until December, 2024.

<text>Mount Holly is a township that is the county seat of Burlington County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is an eastern suburb of Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth largest city as of 2020. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 9,981, an increase of 445 (+4.7%) from the 2010 census count of 9,536, which in turn reflected a decline of 1,192 (-11.1%) from the 10,728 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

What is now Mount Holly was originally formed as Northampton on November 6, 1688. Northampton was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships created by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form Little Egg Harbor Township (February 13, 1740, now part of Ocean County), Washington Township (November 19, 1802), Pemberton borough (December 15, 1826), Coaxen Township (March 10, 1845, now known as Southampton Township), Pemberton Township (March 10, 1846), Westampton Township (March 6, 1850) and Lumberton Township (March 14, 1860). There had been a Mount Holly post office since before the 1870 U.S. Census. The township was renamed Mount Holly as of November 6, 1931, based on the results of a referendum held three days earlier. The township was named for hills covered with holly trees. Some areas of today&#x27;s Mount Holly were known as Bridgetown.

Mount Holly gives its name to the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office for the Philadelphia metropolitan area, serving most of New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, all of Delaware and Eastern Maryland, though the office is actually located in adjacent Westampton.

==History==
===Colonial era===
The first European settlement in what is now Mount Holly began in 1677 when Walter Reeves acquired land from the Lenape (Delaware) Native Americans living in the area. He constructed a dam on Rancocas Creek to channel water through a raceway to power a gristmill and sawmill. Edward Gaskill and his sons dug the mill race on their property between 1720 and 1723. After the mills were established, more settlers were attracted to the area and built houses and commercial buildings on High, Church, White, Mill, and Pine streets, including the Shinn Curtis Log House (1712). By 1800, over 250 dwellings had been built.

Today no mills remain on the raceway, which still flows in its original course from the Rancocas just above the dam. The raceway proved a way for herring to make their way above the dam and was the scene of an annual fish run in the spring, which provided fresh herring for salting and eating. The former mill land has been preserved as the Mill Dam Park. It marks the importance of mills to the early settlements.

===Revolutionary War===
On December 17, 1776, Colonel Samuel Griffin of the Continental Army crossed the Delaware River with 600 men, mostly untrained men and boys with little equipment, who marched to Mount Holly where they set up a few 3-pounder artillery pieces on Iron Works Hill. Hessian commanders von Block and Carl von Donop were told that there were 3,000 American troops at Mount Holly.

By December 23, 1776, 2,000 Hessians were moved from Bordentown and positioned at The Mount in Mount Holly, where they engaged in a three-day-long artillery exchange, known as the Battle of Iron Works Hill or Battle of Mount Holly, with the Americans on Iron Works Hill. The Americans slipped away that night.

After George Washington crossed the Delaware River on December 25, 1776, the fact that thousands of Hessian troops had been drawn to Mount Holly aided in the Continental Army&#x27;s success in the Battle of Trenton the next day, a surprising American victory that helped turn the Army&#x27;s fading morale after the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington just weeks before and the ignominious retreat through New Jersey.

===19th century===
The 1793 state legislature approved the relocation of the Burlington County seat from Burlington City to Mount Holly, which was approved by voters in a 1796 referendum. Several important municipal buildings were constructed, including the courthouse in 1796 and the county prison built . The Burlington County Prison was designed by Robert Mills, a nationally known architect who designed the Washington Monument. The town has numerous 18th and 19th-century buildings, most of which are included in the Mount Holly Historic District. Commercial buildings were constructed primarily along High Street.

In 1849, the Burlington and Mount Holly Railroad was established, connecting communities along the Delaware River to Philadelphia, the major city of the area. The railroad supported industrialization along its route. The Camden and Mount Holly Railroad constructed a station 20 years later near the intersection of Washington and King streets.

===20th century===
A trolley station was built in 1904 for passengers making connections to Burlington City and Moorestown. New municipal buildings were constructed during the 20th century, including the Town Hall on Washington Street (1930) and the U.S. Post Office (1935) located across the street (1935), both federally funded and constructed as Works Progress Administration projects under President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression.

In the late 1950s, Mount Holly began to have economic difficulties due to industrial restructuring and the loss of working-class jobs. In the post-World War II period, numerous blue collar, family wage jobs disappeared as the community&#x27;s traditional employers, the mills and dye factories, were shut down.

<text>Mount Laurel is a township in Burlington County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 44,633, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 2,769 (+6.6%) from the 2010 census count of 41,864, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,643 (+4.1%) from the 40,221 counted in the 2000 census. It is the home of NFL Films.

In 2020, Mount Laurel was ranked 16th in &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 50 best places to live in the United States, citing a kid-friendly environment, affordable housing, and easy access to Philadelphia and the Jersey Shore.

==History==

Mount Laurel was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 7, 1872, from portions of Evesham Township. The township was named for a hill covered with laurel trees.

Several historical landmarks include General Clinton&#x27;s headquarters, Paulsdale, Evesham Friends Meeting House, Jacob&#x27;s Chapel, Hattie Britt School, and Farmer&#x27;s Hall.

===Mount Laurel Decision===
The Mount Laurel Decision is a judicial interpretation of the New Jersey State Constitution that requires municipalities to use their zoning powers in an affirmative manner to provide a realistic opportunity for the production of housing affordable to low and moderate-income households. The decision was a result of a lawsuit brought against the town by the N.A.A.C.P. that was decided by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1975 and reaffirmed in a subsequent decision in 1983.

The history behind this, and the story leading to the decision was highlighted in &quot;Our Town&quot;, a book by David L. Kirp.

Mount Laurel was a small, rural farming community until it was hit with massive suburban growth from Philadelphia in the later 1960s. In 1970, at a meeting about a proposal for taxpayer subsidized housing held at an all-black church in Mount Laurel, Mayor Bill Haines summed up the NIMBYist perspective by saying: &quot;If you people can&#x27;t afford to live in our town, then you&#x27;ll just have to leave.&quot;

Even though the black families in Mount Laurel were not from urban ghettos and were not involved in gang activity, the new suburban influx thought otherwise, and significantly delayed the creation of tax-payer subsidized housing areas, citing concerns of gang activity and an influx of inner-city criminals. Example comments from town meetings against forced construction of housing projects included &quot;...we need this like Custer needed more Indians...&quot;; &quot;...it&#x27;s reverse discrimination...&quot;; &quot;...we lived in this in South Philly and Newark...&quot;, and that the housing would be a &quot;...breeding ground for violent crime and drug abuse...&quot; 

As time went on, Mount Laurel did in fact experience high crime rates, and today is more dangerous than 83% of every other town and city of all sizes in the State of New Jersey, and more dangerous than 82% of all other U.S. cities. The chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime in Mount Laurel is 1 in 46. Based on FBI crime data, the chance that a person will become a victim of a violent crime in Mount Laurel - such as armed robbery, aggravated assault, rape or murder - is 1 in 540. This equates to a rate of 2 per one thousand inhabitants. And Mount Laurel&#x27;s rate for property crime is 20 per one thousand population.

Leading advocate in favor of taxpayer subsidized housing Ethel Lawrence, a black resident who lived her life in Mount Laurel, had her house repeatedly vandalized. Although the court ruled in favor of creating taxpayer subsidized housing, residents did manage to delay the process for decades.

Mount Laurel voted to change its form of government in 1970 from a Township Committee form to a Faulkner Act system using the Council-Manager (Plan E), enacted based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission as of January 1, 1972. The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. In this form of government, the Township Manager oversees the daily functions of the Township.

As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 6,367, a decrease of 1,018 (−13.8%) from the 2010 census count of 7,385, which in turn reflected decline of 2,359 (−24.2%) from the 9,744 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

==History==
New Hanover was originally formed by Royal charter on December 2, 1723, from portions of Chesterfield Township and Springfield Township. New Hanover was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township were taken to form Pemberton borough (December 15, 1826), Pemberton Township (March 10, 1846), North Hanover Township (April 12, 1905) and Wrightstown (March 4, 1918).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 22.56 square miles (58.42 km2), including 22.33 square miles (57.84 km2) of land and 0.22 square miles (0.58 km2) of water (0.99%).

Fort Dix is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) with a total 2010 Census population of 7,716 located in portions of New Hanover Township (5,951 of the total), Pemberton Township (1,765 of CDP&#x27;s residents) and Springfield Township (with no residents in the CDP). McGuire AFB CDP is a CDP with a 2010 population of 3,710 located in portions of New Hanover Township (737 of the total) and North Hanover Township (2,973).

<text>Palmyra is a borough in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,438, an increase of 40 (+0.5%) from the 2010 census count of 7,398, which in turn reflected an increase of 307 (+4.3%) from the 7,091 counted in the 2000 census. The borough, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Palmyra was originally incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 19, 1894, from portions of Cinnaminson Township and Riverton. On February 20, 1923, Palmyra was reincorporated as a borough.

==History==
The area that is now Palmyra was settled in the late 17th century by Swedes, marking the northernmost border of New Sweden. A farmhouse built in 1761 by the third generation of settlers still remains as the oldest house in Palmyra. Farming was the primary use of land in Palmyra and the surrounding area until after the construction of the Camden and Amboy Railroad in 1834 with a station in the area, after which railroad workers built homes on lots they purchased along the railroad right of way. The community was originally known as Texas, but a local landowner, Isaiah Toy, a descendant of the original Swedish settlers and a stockholder in the Camden and Amboy Railroad, who wanted to have a post office established in the community, convinced the railroad to change the name of the station in 1849 to Palmyra, which came from his love of ancient history. Palmyra was the name of an ancient trading center located in central Syria. The post office was established in 1851. Palmyra, along with Bordentown, Burlington, Moorestown Township, and Mount Holly Township, established its high school in the late 1890s, making it one of the oldest high schools in Burlington County and in New Jersey.

The community was laid out in 1850, when Joseph Souder&#x27;s land was broken up into building lots to pay his debts, with the street names matching those of Center City, Philadelphia—Market, Arch, Race, and Vine (from south to north), and Front Street and numbered streets from the Delaware River. What is now Palmyra was part of Chester Township (now Maple Shade Township), which was created in 1694 and was one of the original 104 townships in New Jersey incorporated in 1798. Palmyra became a part of Cinnaminson Township when that township was set off from Chester in 1860. Palmyra Township was set off from Cinnaminson in 1894, and Palmyra was incorporated as a borough in 1923.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.54 square miles (6.58 km2), including 1.85 square miles (4.79 km2) of land and 0.69 square miles (1.79 km2) of water (27.28%).

The borough borders Cinnaminson Township and Riverton in Burlington County; Pennsauken Township in Camden County; and Philadelphia, across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania.

The borough is connected to the Tacony section of Philadelphia via Route 73 by the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge, which is named for the two communities connected by the bridge. The bridge was completed in 1929 at a cost of $4 million.

In 1999, a nature park, Palmyra Nature Cove, was opened along the banks of the Delaware which borders Palmyra on the west; in addition to serving as a bird sanctuary, the park offers educational programs for schools and hiking trails for walkers. The park is open from dawn to dusk; no pets or bicycles are allowed.

== Government ==
=== Local government ===

Pemberton Township is governed within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Mayor-Council form of municipal government (Plan 1), implemented based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission as of January 1, 1991, changing from a five-member Township Committee form based on the results of a referendum passed by voters in 1989. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under the Mayor-Council form. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the five-member Township Council, all of whom are elected at-large in partisan elections to serve four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either two seats (and the mayoral seat) or three seats up for election during even-numbered years as part of the November general election.

Voters approved a November 2006 referendum to change from having all five council seats up for vote simultaneously to a system in which the elections are staggered every two years. Under the terms of the change, the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the November 2010 election would serve full four-year terms, with the three other winners serving two-year terms. As the three winners with the lowest number of votes in the 2010 election, the terms of Rick Prickett, Sherry Scull and Diane Stinney ended in December 2012.

Sherry Scull resigned from office in August 2015 due to issues related to her state pension. In September, the Township Council selected Thomas J. Cathers Sr., from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat on an interim basis. In the November general election, Republican Jack Tompkins was elected to fill the balance of the term through December 2016.

In March 2016, the Township Council appointed former councilmember Kenneth Cartier to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that became vacant following the death of Diane Stinney.

In March 2018, Elisabeth McCartney was appointed to fill the seat expiring December 2020 that became vacant following the resignation of Kenneth Cartier, who announced that he was moving out of the township. McCartney served on an interim basis until the November 2018 general election, when she was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

, the Mayor of Pemberton Township is Republican Jack K. Tompkins, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Pemberton Township Council are Paul C. Detrick (D, 2024), Daniel Dewey Sr. (R, 2026), Donovan Gardner (D, 2024), Elisabeth McCartney (D, 2024) and Joshua Ward (R, 2026).

The police department consists of 57 officers and is headed by Chief David Jantas.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===

Riverside Township is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor, each for a term of one year.

, members of the Riverside Township Committee are Mayor Michael Higgins (R, term on committee ends December 31, 2023; term as mayor ends 2023), Deputy Mayor Corey S. Kimble (D, term on committee ends December 31, 2023; term as deputy mayor ends 2023), Robert Giovanetti (D, 2024), Matthew Kirk (R, 2024) and Joseph Peditto (R, 2025).

In March 2023, Higgins switched parties and announce that he would run as a Republican in November 2023; the switch gave Republicans a 3-2 majority on the council.

In March 2019, the Township Committee chose Michael Higgins from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that became vacant when Michael D. Miller submitted his resignation. In the November 2019 general election, Republican Matthew Kirk defeated Higgins by a single vote and was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

In January 2018, Republican F. Michael Hart was selected by the Township Committee from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that was vacated by Robert R. Prisco after he resigned to accept a Judicial appointment to a New Jersey Workers&#x27; Compensation Judgeship; Hart served on an interim basis until the November 2018 general election, when voters elected Democrat Michelle Weaver to serve the balance of the term of office.

In July 2016, Jason Frey was selected by the Township Committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2018 that was vacated by Timothy LeConey when he announced that he was resigning and moving out of the township. Frey served on an interim basis until the November 2016 general election, when he was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

On Election Day, November 7, 2006, Mayor Chuck Hilton and fellow Republican incumbent James Ott were defeated by their Democratic opponents, newcomers Lorraine Hatcher and Thomas Polino. An anti-immigration ordinance passed by the Township Committee that imposed fines on any business that hires or any landlord who rents to an illegal immigrant was a major issue in the campaign.

==In film==
Riverside was used for the filming of the film &quot;Jesus&#x27; Son&quot; and was the site of picketing by nuns who objected to the implication from the film&#x27;s title that Jesus fathered a child.

==Immigration debate==
In July 2006, a controversial ordinance was passed by the township committee trying to handle the large number of unauthorized immigrants, primarily from Brazil, that had moved into the township. The ordinance stated that employers who hired an illegal immigrant and landlords who rented to them would be fined $1,000 - $2,000 per incident and could possibly lose their business license. In response to the ordinance, several civil groups including the ACLU and People for the American Way took or contemplated legal actions against the ordinance.

In August 2007, the ordinance was repealed, and some have speculated that the exodus of over 1,000 immigrants from Riverside to other New Jersey townships was a major factor. The ordinance repealing the law cited the high cost of defending it against further legal challenges.

<text>Shamong Township (pronounced &quot;Shuh-MUNG&quot;) is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 6,460, a decrease of 30 (−0.5%) from the 2010 census count of 6,490, which in turn reflected an increase of 28 (+0.4%) from the 6,462 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Shamong was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 19, 1852, from portions of Medford, Southampton and Washington townships. Portions of the township were taken to form Woodland Township (March 7, 1866) and Tabernacle Township (March 22, 1901). In April 1902, portions of Hammonton and Waterford Township were annexed to the township. The township&#x27;s name comes from Native American terms meaning &quot;place of the big horn&quot;, from the words &quot;oschummo&quot; (&quot;horn&quot;) and &quot;onk&quot; (&quot;place&quot;).

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Shamong Township as its 6th best place to live in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

==History==
This area, along with much of present-day southern New Jersey, was inhabited by Lenape Native Americans at the time of European encounter. They spoke &quot;Unami,&quot; one of the three major dialects of the Lenape language, which belonged to the Algonquian language family. The Lenape territory ranged from the New York metropolitan area and western Long Island, extending into New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River, and Delaware.

By the mid-18th century, English colonists had displaced the local Lenape of southern New Jersey onto what was previously known as the Brotherton Indian Reservation. This reservation was in the area of present-day Indian Mills, which was named after mills built and operated by the Brotherton people, who were converted Christian Indians. Some of them were relocated in 1765 from Cranbury, New Jersey. With sustained pressure following the American Revolutionary War, the Brotherton Indians of New Jersey migrated to New York. They accepted an offer by the Stockbridge–Munsee Community, also Christian converts, to settle on their reservation in the central part of the state, where they had been allocated land by the Oneida people, one of the Iroquois nations. Some of the Munsee-speaking Lenape from the northern part of their territory also migrated there. These remaining communities were attempting to reorganize after years of disease and conflict with colonists and major powers. The Brotherton Indians sold their last property in New Jersey in 1818 and had essentially been absorbed by the Munsee.

Following the Revolutionary War, settlers from New England flooded into New York, encroaching on Indian territory. Ultimately, the Stockbridge and Munsee were relocated to Wisconsin in the 1820s and 1830s, forced out along with the Oneida by the United States Indian Removal policy, which sought to relocate Native Americans to the west of the Mississippi River. Today, the Stockbridge–Munsee Community is a federally recognized tribe, with a reservation in Shawano County, Wisconsin.

In 1992, a non-binding referendum gave voters the opportunity to consider renaming the township to Indian Mills, the name of an unincorporated community within the township.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 45.01 square miles (116.58 km2), including 44.45 square miles (115.14 km2) of land and 0.56 square miles (1.44 km2) of water (1.24%). Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Atsion, Dellette, Flyat, Hampton Furnace, High Crossing, Indian Mills, and Smalls.

The township borders Medford Township, Tabernacle Township, and Washington Township in Burlington County; Hammonton in Atlantic County; and Waterford Township in Camden County.

The township is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. All of the township is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Burlington County, along with areas in Atlantic, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

<text>Tabernacle Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 6,776, a decrease of 173 (−2.5%) from the 2010 census count of 6,949, which in turn reflected a decline of 221 (−3.1%) from the 7,170 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Tabernacle was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 22, 1901, from portions of Shamong Township, Southampton Township and Woodland Township. The township was named for a tabernacle constructed by missionaries David and John Brainerd.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Tabernacle Township as its 23rd best place to live in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey. &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Tabernacle Township as its sixth-best place to live in its 2010 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey. In 2009, it was rated the #1 small town by &quot;South Jersey&quot; Magazine.

==History==
The area now known as Tabernacle was originally inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans. In 1778, John Brainerd established a Christian church called &quot;Tabernacle in the Wilderness,&quot; with the aim of converting the local Native American population to Christianity. In 1803, William Wilkins sold land to 28 individuals for the creation of Tabernacle Cemetery, which was located adjacent to the church.

The church also served as a schoolhouse, but as the community expanded, a one-room schoolhouse was built in 1856 at the future location of Tabernacle Town Hall. A sawmill was constructed in the Friendship area in the early 1700s, and around 1860, Gilbert Knight built the Knight-Pepper House near the Town Hall. The property subsequently passed to the Scott and Pepper families, and upon the death of Clara Pepper in 1987, it was donated to the Tabernacle Historic Society. In the 1880s, the Tabernacle Methodist Episcopal Church was constructed on the original site, where it still stands today.

Tabernacle became an incorporated township on March 22, 1901, through an act of the New Jersey Legislature, incorporating portions of Shamong Township, Southampton Township, and Woodland Township.

On July 13, 1928, Emilio Carranza, known as the &quot;Lindbergh of Mexico,&quot; tragically crashed in Tabernacle during a storm while flying from New York City to Mexico. The Carranza Memorial was erected in his memory, funded by Mexican schoolchildren, and Hampton Gates Road was subsequently renamed Carranza Road in his honor.

In 1909, the one-room schoolhouse was demolished and replaced by a two-room schoolhouse; it was relocated down the road in 1936, and two additional rooms were added. In the 1950s, the Tabernacle Elementary School was constructed on New Road, and Olson Middle School (previously Tabernacle Middle School) was built across the road in 1968. Following the death of Kenneth R. Olson in 1990, the Tabernacle School District renamed the school in his honor. In 2003, Seneca High School was established to serve high school students from Tabernacle, Shamong, Southampton, and Woodland Townships.

In 1970, the population of Tabernacle was 2,103. By 1980, the population had nearly tripled to 6,236, reflecting the rapid suburbanization of the Delaware Valley in South Jersey. The population peaked at 7,362 in 1990, but has been gradually decreasing since then, with 7,170 residents recorded in 2000, and 6,949 in the 2010 census.

<text>Willingboro Township (known from 1959 to 1963 as Levittown and Levittown Township) is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a suburb of Philadelphia and part of the state&#x27;s South Jersey region. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 31,889, an increase of 260 (+0.8%) from the 2010 census count of 31,629, which in turn reflected a decline of 1,379 (−4.2%) from the 33,008 counted in the 2000 census.

The township has British roots going back to the 17th century. Abraham Levitt and Sons purchased and developed Willingboro land in the 1950s and 1960s as a planned community in their Levittown model.

The 1967 book &quot;The Levittowners&quot;, by sociologist Herbert J. Gans, was a famous case study in American urban sociology based on the development of Levittown. Willingboro later became a predominantly African American suburb.

==History==

Willingboro was one of the original nine divisions in the organization of Burlington County within West Jersey, and was originally formed as the &quot;Constabulary of Wellingborrow&quot; on November 6, 1688. At the time, it included present day Delanco Township, New Jersey. The original name of Wellingborough was after the community in England, which was the hometown of Thomas Olive, who led the original settlers into what would become Willingboro Township. Other spellings were used at different times.

After the establishment of the United States and the State of New Jersey, the community was formally incorporated as &quot;Willingborough Township&quot;, one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships, on February 21, 1798, by the New Jersey Legislature when it enacted &quot;An Act incorporating the Inhabitants of Townships, designating their Powers, and regulating their Meetings&quot;, P.L. 1798, p. 289. This makes Willingboro one of the oldest townships in the State. Portions of the township were taken to form Beverly borough (March 5, 1850, now Beverly city) and Beverly Township (March 1, 1859, now known as Delanco Township).

In the 1950s and 1960s, Willingboro was the location for a massive residential development by Levitt &amp; Sons. The town was to be Levitt &amp; Sons&#x27; third and largest Levittown development, following similar projects in New York and Pennsylvania. Levitt acquired the great majority of the land in Willingboro; the historic community of Rancocas, in the southeast portion of the township, was annexed to Westampton Township to keep it from being bulldozed, as Levitt wished to keep the development within the boundaries of a single municipality. The first Levittown homes were sold in June 1958, at which time the community was already known as Levittown, New Jersey.

The town&#x27;s name was changed from the original Willingboro to &quot;Levittown Township&quot; by a referendum of township residents held on November 3, 1959. Willingboro was less than from Levittown, Pennsylvania and this occasionally caused confusion. The community used the name &quot;Levittown, New Jersey&quot; in 1958, and &quot;Levittown Township&quot; from 1959 to 1963. A referendum held on the issue on November 5, 1963, changed the name back to Willingboro. The name change was passed by a narrow margin of 3,123 to 3,003. In retaliation, Levitt refused to donate any more schools to the fast-growing community. With residential development, the 1950 population of 852 rapidly climbed to 11,861 in 1960; and 43,386 in 1970.

When homes for the new Levittown were first being sold in 1958, Levitt and Sons had a policy against sales to African Americans. W. R. James, an African-American officer in the Army&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Division, was stationed at nearby Fort Dix and applied to purchase a Levittown home. On June 29, 1958, an agent of Levitt and Sons told him that the new Levittown development would be an all-white community. James filed suit against the company challenging their policy. A friend of his, who worked at the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights, said that it was illegal in New Jersey to discriminate in federally-subsidized housing. At the time, &quot;de facto&quot; racial segregation in housing existed in many areas in the United States. Levittown was receiving mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration. But as of 1958, the law had not been tested.

James sued Levitt in a case that ultimately went to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which upheld lower court rulings in favor of James. James was not the first African American to move into Willingboro. Given James&#x27; success in his suit, Charles and Vera Williams purchased a house and moved into the community in 1960, the first African-American family in Willingboro. James eventually moved into Millbrook Park in 1960. He served as head of the local chapter of the NAACP and eventually became a minister. An elementary school in Willingboro was named in his honor.

Following the court case, Levitt developed a thorough integration program. The company set up an integration committee headed by Howard Lett, an African American. Lett created a five-point program, which included the announcement by community leaders of Levitt&#x27;s plan to desegregate housing, and a thorough briefing program for Levitt employees, government officials, the police and the press. Lett recommended an attempt to discourage anti-integration activities known as &quot;Operation Hothead&quot;. Lett created a Human Relations Council to oversee possible disputes in community. James served as a member of that committee. The committee tried to solve problems of juvenile delinquency in the township. It opposed a curfew passed by the Township Council in the early 1970s. The curfew was later dropped, but reintroduced later.

The African-American population of Willingboro increased throughout the 1960s; by 1964 there were 50 African-American families. By 1970, African Americans represented about 11% of the population. During the early 1970s, several homeowners said they were approached by local real estate agents and told that their neighborhood was becoming increasingly African-American and home values could decline if they did not sell quickly; a practice known as blockbusting. While the Human Relations Council could not prove these claims, it made recommendations to help foster better relations between ethnic communities in the township and calm concerns.

The township in 1974 enacted an ordinance that prohibited the posting of &quot;for sale&quot; or &quot;sold&quot; signs on real estate. Proponents of the ordinance alleged the purpose was to maintain integration. Many other communities had enacted similar laws in reaction to the practice of blockbusting in the 1960s and 1970s. The Supreme Court in the 1977 case of &quot;Linmark Associates, Inc. v.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 8.14 square miles (21.08 km2), including 7.73 square miles (20.01 km2) of land and 0.41 square miles (1.07 km2) of water (5.09%).

The township borders the Burlington County municipalities of Burlington Township, Delanco Township, Delran Township, Edgewater Park Township, Moorestown Township, Mount Laurel Township and Westampton Township. Rancocas Creek drains Willingboro and forms its SW boundary while U.S. Route 130 forms its NW boundary.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Bortons Landing, Charleston and Cooperstown.

===Parks and sections===
Willingboro is divided into several sections called parks. Each section&#x27;s street names begin with the same letter as the corresponding section name. For example, streets in Pennypacker Park all begin with the letter &quot;P&quot;. This is the case with all parks, excluding Martin&#x27;s Beach and certain streets in Rittenhouse Park. Some streets that predate Levittown retained their original names, such as Charleston Road.

Originally, each park or section had its own swimming pool for residents&#x27; use. Residents&#x27; families would receive free swim tags after showing applicable IDs at each section&#x27;s school or the community office. However, some swimming pools, such as Hawthorne Park, have been inactive for years. Free lessons and other events were focused on these &quot;park&quot; pools during the summer months. By the 1990s, only Pennypacker Park and Country Club Park had operating summer pools. Finally, Country Club Park and Pennypacker Park have been denoted the &quot;community pools&quot; at this time.

The township&#x27;s parks include: 
* Buckingham Park
* Country Club Ridge, laid out in the 1960s around a golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones.
* Pennypacker Park
* Millbrook Park
* Martin&#x27;s Beach

* Windsor Park
* Garfield Park
* Garfield Park East
* Garfield Park North

== Government ==
=== Local government ===

Willingboro Township is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Council-Manager form of government (Plan E), enacted by direct petition and implemented as of January 1, 1962. The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The current Council-Manager form of government was adopted by referendum in November 1960 based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission. The elections for the first council to operate under the new Council-Manager form of government took place in November 1961, with the new council taking office as of January 1, 1962, under the new form. The Township Council is comprised of five members, who are elected in partisan elections to serve four-year terms in office on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming up for election as part of the November general election during odd-numbered years. At a reorganization held during the first week of January after each election, the council selects a Mayor and Deputy Mayor from among its members.

, the members of the Willingboro Township Council are Mayor Kaya T. McIntosh (D, term on council ends December 31, 2027; term as mayor ends 2025), Deputy Mayor Nathaniel Anderson (D, term on council and as deputy mayor ends 2025), Rebecca Perrone (D, 2025), Samantha E. Whitfield (D, 2027) and Tiffani A. Worthy (D, 2027).

In July 2017, the council selected Rebecca Perone from a list of three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the seat that had been held by Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Walker expiring in December 2019 until he resigned from his post as mayor in June 2017.

The township council appointed Chris Walker in October 2013 to fill the vacant seat of Ken Gordon, after a New Jersey Superior Court judge ruled that Gordon&#x27;s seat was vacant based on his having missed a series of council meetings. Eddie Campbell was named to fill Gordon&#x27;s former position as deputy mayor. Darvis Holley was appointed in April 2014 to fill the vacant seat of Jim Ayrer, who had resigned after serving on the council for 34 years.

== Education ==
Willingboro Township Public Schools serves students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of nine schools, had an enrollment of 3,456 students and 277.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.5:1. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are Garfield East Early Childhood Development Center with 214 students in grades Pre-K–K, 
J. Cresswell Stuart Early Childhood Development Center with 305 students in grades Pre-K–K, 
Hawthorne Elementary School with 352 students in grades 1–4, 
W.R. James Sr. Elementary School with 353 students in grades 1–4, 
Twin Hills Elementary School with 321 students in grades 1–4, 
Levitt Intermediate School with 558 students in grades 5–6, 
Willingboro Memorial Middle School with 573 students in grades 7–8, and 
Willingboro High School with 674 students in grades 9–12.

During the early development of the township, all high school students attended Levittown High School for grades 9–12 (LHS was renamed &quot;Levitt Jr. High School&quot; when the new high school—John F. Kennedy—was opened in 1964). It was the only junior high school, grades 7 through 9, until Memorial Junior High School opened in 1968. The substantial student population at JFK HS required that the school go to split sessions and only was able to house grades 10–12, with the freshmen classes divided between Memorial and Levitt junior high schools. In 1975, Willingboro HS was opened and became the &quot;sister&quot; school, located only about two miles apart—both on JFK Way. Over time student enrollment fell and both middle schools would eventually close. The district shifted the make-up of the school and elementary schools held grades K-7 while the two high schools held grades 8-12. This is the way the township was until JFK HS became a middle school in 1990, leaving Willingboro as the only high school. By this time, the township population fell and Levitt Junior High School was closed to become township offices and storage. Memorial Junior High School would remain open for college classes for Burlington County College. Kennedy Middle School eventually closed and became Kennedy Center, a community center for the performing arts, an additional gym for events, and classrooms for college classes.

The S.W. Bookbinder, J.A. McGinley and Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary Schools were closed at the end of the 2005–2006 school year as part of an effort to save about $3.6 million, through the reduction of as many as 100 staff members and class sizes increased as large as 27 at the five remaining elementary schools. The cuts were needed to fill a two-year budget deficit of nearly $10 million.

Students from Willingboro Township, and from all of Burlington County, are eligible to attend the Burlington County Institute of Technology, a countywide public school district that serves the vocational and technical education needs of students at the high school and post-secondary level at its campuses in Medford and Westampton Township.

The Willingboro Public Library (WPL) is the municipal public library for the community. It first opened in 1960 and operates independently from the Burlington County Library System. Before 2003, the library was housed in the township&#x27;s municipal building on Salem Road. The current library building is . and is an anchor for the new Willingboro Town Center on Route 130.

<text>Woodland Township is a township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 1,544, a decrease of 244 (−13.6%) from the 2010 census count of 1,788, which in turn reflected an increase of 618 (+52.8%) from the 1,170 counted in the 2000 census. The township, and all of Burlington County, is a part of the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Woodland was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 7, 1866, from portions of Pemberton Township, Shamong Township, Southampton Township and Washington Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Tabernacle Township on March 22, 1901.

== History ==
The area now known as Woodland Township was originally inhabited by the Lenape Native American tribe. European settlers began arriving in the late 17th century, attracted by the fertile soil and abundant lumber resources. The settlers cleared land for farming and built homes and other structures using local materials, including wood and sandstone.

Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Woodland was predominantly an agricultural community, with farming being the primary occupation for most residents. The fertile soil in the region was ideal for growing a variety of crops, including corn, wheat, and potatoes. In addition to crop farming, livestock, dairy, and poultry farming also played a significant role in the local economy.

In the early 20th century, several small-scale industries began to emerge in Woodland, including sawmills, gristmills, and blacksmith shops. These industries relied heavily on the local resources, such as timber and iron ore, and provided employment opportunities for the residents.

In the latter half of the 20th century, Woodland experienced a shift away from agriculture and towards a more diversified economy. Although farming remained an important aspect of the township&#x27;s identity, the focus shifted to include manufacturing, retail, and service-based industries.

The township has a mix of residential, commercial, and agricultural areas, reflecting its multifaceted history. Woodland is known for its landscapes, including the scenic Brendan T. Byrne State Forest, which offers numerous recreational opportunities such as hiking, camping, and birdwatching.

==Government==

===Local government===

Wrightstown is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Wrightstown is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Wrightstown is Republican Donald Cottrell, who was elected to serve a term of office ending December 31, 2024. Members of the Wrightstown Borough Council are Council President William L. Bird Jr. (R, 2023), Jason Bushnell (D, 2024; elected to serve an unexpired term), Donna L. Carroll (R, 2025), Joseph Craig (R, 2023; elected to serve an unexpired term), Jeanie L. Knapp (R, 2025) and Laurance R. Lownds (D, 2024), with one seat vacant.

After David Scott Timberman resigned from office in November 2021, the borough council selected Donald Cottrell from a list of three candidates to fill the seat expiring in December 2024.

In September 2019, the New Jersey State Comptroller referred a case involving Mayor Thomas Harper to the New Jersey Attorney General for possible criminal charges; it was alleged that the mayor had allowed a private company to dump of untreated septic tank waste into facilities operated by the borough&#x27;s municipal utilities authority without the company having paid any fees. In September 2020, Mayor Harper was charged by the Attorney General&#x27;s Office of Public Integrity and Accountability with lying to investigators, after he allegedly knowingly made false statements during the course of the Office of the Comptroller&#x27;s investigation. Harper resigned from office later that month, but his named remained as the only candidate for mayor listed on the ballot in the November 2020 general election.

In July 2012, following the death of Brian Sperling in the previous month, the borough council selected William Bird to fill Sperling&#x27;s vacancy on the council and picked Costic Michael Borsavage to take over his role as council president.

Jennifer Heisler, a councilmember who resigned in October 2010, was sentenced in November 2011 to five years of probation after pleading guilty to the theft of $20,000 from Wrightstown Volunteer Fire Company, of which she had been the treasurer.

<text>Audubon is a borough in Camden County, in the southern portion of the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,707, a decrease of 112 (−1.3%) from the 2010 census count of 8,819, which in turn had reflected a decline of 363 (−4.0%) from the 9,182 counted at the 2000 census. Located right outside of Philadelphia and the city of Camden, Audubon constitutes part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. 

== History ==
The area that was to become Audubon was initially settled in the late 17th Century by various land owners and was primarily used for farms and mills. In 1695 the land now known as the Borough of Audubon was part of Newton Township. By the early 1700s, the area&#x27;s first families were building their homesteads. Today, two of these original farmhouses remain in Audubon. The Low-Stokes-Nicholson house was built by John Low. Simon Breach built his home, known locally as &quot;The Mansion House&quot;, in about 1740. A large addition was built by shipbuilder John Dialogue in . Samuel Nicholson Rhodes, a local naturalist and author, owned this farm, which he named &quot;Cedarcroft&quot;, from 1898–1912. It was Mrs. Rhodes who came up with the name for the town. When the Atlantic City Railroad arrived in the 1880s the local farms were subdivided into the smaller communities of Audubon, Cedarcroft and Orston. Residential development began when both Audubon and Orston had train stations built in the 1890s.

On March 13, 1905, through an act of the New Jersey Legislature, Audubon was created as a borough from portions of Haddon Township. It was named for John James Audubon, the naturalist. Based upon the results of a referendum on October 28, 1947, portions of Audubon were taken to form the borough of Audubon Park.

Audubon is the home of three Medal of Honor recipients, the most awarded per capita of any town in the United States: Samuel M. Sampler (World War I), Edward Clyde Benfold (Korean War) and Nelson V. Brittin (Korean War). The three are honored by a memorial at Audubon High School.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.50 square miles (3.87 km2), including 1.48 square miles (3.84 km2) of land and 0.01 square miles (0.04 km2) of water (0.93%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Orston.

Audubon borders Audubon Park, Haddon Heights, Haddon Township, Haddonfield, Mount Ephraim and Oaklyn.

===Climate===
The climate in the area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Audubon has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="125064" wikidata="Q1086682" url="?curid=125064" title="Bellmawr, New Jersey">
<text>Bellmawr ( ) is a borough in Camden County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 11,707, an increase of 124 (+1.1%) from the 2010 census count of 11,583, which in turn reflected an increase of 321 (+2.9%) from the 11,262 counted in the 2000 census.

Bellmawr is home to the main post office for the area, one of the largest in the state of New Jersey, handling an average of 4.5 million pieces of mail daily.

== History ==
Bellmawr was authorized to incorporate as a borough on March 23, 1926, from portions of the now-defunct Centre Township, and was made independent based on the results of a referendum held on April 21, 1926. The boroughs of Mount Ephraim, Runnemede and Lawnside were also created in the same two-day period. The borough was named for Ernest C. Bell, who owned a farm in the area.

In 1966, the Bellmawr Police Department investigated several officers for ticket fixing. The officers were ordered to cooperate with internal investigators and give statements and told that they would be fired if they refused to do so; upon answering the investigators&#x27; questions, the officers were criminally charged. In 1967, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the officers&#x27; self-incriminating statements violated the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, and that it was therefore unconstitutional to use their statements in a prosecution; the officers&#x27; convictions were overturned. The case, &quot;Garrity v. New Jersey&quot;, led to the creation of the Garrity warning, which advises government employees of their rights during internal investigations.

In late October 2001, the Bellmawr post office was closed due to possible anthrax contamination in the wake of the 2001 anthrax attacks. The office was re-opened several days later, in early November, after testing negative for anthrax.

In 2017, Bellmawr joined Cranbury, Egg Harbor Township, Montclair and Woodbridge Township as one of the first five municipalities in the state that have authorized dispensaries to sell medical cannabis.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 3.11 square miles (8.05 km2), including 2.98 square miles (7.73 km2) of land and 0.12 square miles (0.32 km2) of water (3.92%).

The borough borders the municipalities of Barrington, Brooklawn, Gloucester City, Haddon Heights, Mount Ephraim, and Runnemede in Camden County; and Deptford Township and Westville, both in Gloucester County.
