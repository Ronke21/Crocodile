<text>Escanaba ( ), commonly shortened to Esky, is a port city and the county seat of Delta County in the U.S. state of Michigan, located on Little Bay de Noc in the state&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. The population was 12,450 at the 2020 census, making it the third-largest city in the Upper Peninsula after Marquette and Sault Ste. Marie.

There is also Escanaba Township, which is north of the city and is not adjacent to it, although a portion of the urban area around the city extends into the township. Both are named for the Escanaba River, which flows into the Little Bay de Noc of Lake Michigan just north of the city. The names are derived from the Ojibwa language.

== History ==
Escanaba was the name of an Ojibwa village in this area in the early 19th century. The Ojibwa are one of the Anishinaabe, Algonquian-speaking tribes who settled and flourished around the Great Lakes. The word &quot;Escanaba&quot; roughly translates from Ojibwe and other regional Algonquian languages to &quot;land of the red buck&quot;, although some people maintain that it refers to &quot;flat rock&quot;.

As a European-American settlement, Escanaba was founded in 1863 as a port town by surveyor Eli P. Royce. Early industry was the processing and harvesting of lumber, dominated in this area by Daniel Wells Jr., Jefferson Sinclair, and Nelson Ludington. Ludington later moved his headquarters to Chicago, where he also entered banking. I. Stephenson established a successor lumber company in the area and also became a capitalist.

Before the war, iron ore was being mined from the Marquette Iron Range, which shipped out on barges from Escanaba. By the time of the American Civil War, this port was important to the Union as a shipping point for these ores, in addition to lumber. The Menominee Range and Gogebic Range of Michigan became important for iron ore after the war, in the 1880s. In 1994, Michigan produced about 25% of the iron ore nationally. Initially lumber was still integral to shipbuilding, and supported the construction of houses in cities throughout the developing Midwest. Iron ore supported industrialization, and became part of steel and other industries in the Midwest.
As shipping increased, a lighthouse was needed to warn of a sand shoals in Little Bay de Noc, which extended from Sand Point, a sandspit located just south of and adjacent to the harbor area. The United States Lighthouse Service approved construction of the Sand Point Lighthouse at a cost of $11,000. Construction began in the fall of 1867 and was completed in early spring 1868.

===Present day===
Until 2017, Escanaba continued to be an important shipping point for iron ore to other Great Lakes ports, especially south to Chicago and northern Indiana. The local paper mill, for many years owned by Mead Corporation&#x27;s Publishing Paper Division, was operated by the Verso Corporation until 2022 when it was sold to Billerud. Located on the outskirts of the city alongside the Escanaba River, in 2018 the mill was Escanaba&#x27;s largest employer.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
This climatic region is classified as humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot;, according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. It is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. Escanaba is described as being in the banana belt of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. While most of the peninsula is affected by significant lake-effect snow, Escanaba&#x27;s winter climate is much milder due to its location on the windward Lake Michigan shoreline.

==Railroads==
The Escanaba area has been serviced by several railroads. The former Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railroad connected Green Bay to their main system around the same time that they built their mainline to Escanaba. The CMSP&amp;P otherwise known as the Milwaukee Road connected Escanaba to their system shortly thereafter. In 1898, the Escanaba &amp; Lake Superior owned by Issac Stephenson constructed a line from its connection to the Milwaukee Road. Both the C&amp;NW and the CMSP&amp;P ran passenger service to the Escanaba area as well. The C&amp;NW also connected to the Duluth Missabe &amp; Iron Range railroad in Escanaba. The C&amp;NW would acquire the CMSP&amp;P&#x27;s trackage in Escanaba and Wells. With the creation of the Wisconsin Central railroad, most of the lines in Escanaba were unified in a single operation with the exception of the DMIR and the E&amp;LS. In 2004, when CN controlled the WC, the DMIR sold to Canadian National. As of April 2021, just the E&amp;LS and CN remain. CN owns the last two yards in Escanaba, being the Gladstone Yard, and the Escanaba Ore Docks.

The city of Escanaba lies roughly 14 km (9 mi) to the south.

==History==

===Initial settlement===
The first people to occupy the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were Algonquin speaking peoples.

Gladstone was first settled by European descendants in 1859 when the Hamilton Corporation of Fayette began using it as a shipping port for selling and transporting iron ore. The earliest development was located along Saunder&#x27;s Point, a small peninsula extending into Little Bay De Noc. The peninsula was named for Captain Nate Saunders who headquartered there while fishing at various points along the bay.

===Change from shipping port to rail hub===

Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Gladstone expanded to become a shipping point for lumber, coal, and copper, in addition to iron ore.

In 1876, the mine operated by the Hamilton Corporation was depleted, and the company moved their operations to a new mine further south. As a result, more ore began to be shipped out of Escanaba. Gladstone&#x27;s role shifted to that of a rail hub, as Arthur Delano, the president of Soo Line Railroad, had commissioned a train depot built in Saunder&#x27;s Point during the previous winter to start land shipping for the Hamilton Corporation.

Gladstone was incorporated as a village in 1887 and as a city in 1889.

===Name change===
The town was originally named Minnewasca by the Soo Line Railroad, an Ojibwa word meaning &quot;white water.&quot; When the name was filed with the county and Secretary of State in Lansing, however, Senator W. D. Washburn, who had an interest in building the railroad, persuaded officials to change the name to Gladstone in honor of British Premier William Ewart Gladstone.

==Geography==
The city is located on a small projection into the Little Bay de Noc, which opens onto Green Bay on Lake Michigan.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Neighborhoods===

Although Gladstone is a relatively small city, it has several distinct sections: Downtown (which hosts most of the local businesses), the Buckeye (located on the western side of the city, bordering the Brampton, MI township), and the Bluff (which hosts most of the new residential expansion, as well as Gladstone High School). Gladstone High School sports teams are referred to as the Braves, which along with the Escanaba Eskymos give Delta County two schools bearing indigenous symbols.

===Climate===
Gladstone has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and warm summers. The average temperature in January is around 16 °F (-9 °C). Gladstone receives an average of 36 inches of snow and 33 inches of rainfall per year.

According to the National Weather Service, Gladstone&#x27;s record low was -60 °F on January 7, 1896. To this day, this storm is referred to by Gladstone residents as &quot;les morte a doigts,&quot; since so many of the city&#x27;s residents lost fingers due to frostbite. On July 19, 1992, Gladstone experienced a rare tornado which caused moderate damage throughout the city.

==Menominee Range==

Iron Mountain is located within the Menominee Iron-Bearing District, which covers southern Dickinson County and extends westward into Iron County. Iron ore was discovered in Dickinson County in 1849 and Iron County in 1851. Ore is produced from the middle Precambrian Vulcan Iron-Formation around Iron Mountain, and the Riverton Iron-Formation between Iron River, Michigan and Crystal Falls, Michigan. Both formations belong to the Marquette Range Supergroup. The Vulcan is between 300 and 800 feet thick and consists of hematite and magnetite with quartz, while the Riverton is 100–600 feet thick and consists of siderite and chert.

With few riders remaining, the &quot;Copper Country Limited&quot; made its last runs on March 7, 1968. The C&amp;NW also discontinued its service to Iron Mountain in the early 1960s.

In 1832, George William Barnes purchased the land that would become Charlotte from the U.S. government. Barnes in turn sold the land to Edmond B. Bostwick, a land speculator from New York City three years later in 1835. Bostwick then sold portions of the land to H.I. Lawrence, Townsend Harris, and Francis Cochran. The four created the village which they named after Edmond Bostwick&#x27;s wife, Charlotte, who originally wanted it to be called, Charlotteville. Jonathan Searles became the first postmaster on March 17, 1838.

Charlotte was incorporated as a village on October 10, 1863, and as a city on March 29, 1871. At various times, Charlotte had the unofficial names of Eaton Centre, and Carmel. It was designated as the county seat when Eaton County was organized in 1837; however, due to a lack of population and buildings, county functions were conducted at Bellevue until 1840.

The Dolson automobile was manufactured in Charlotte from 1904 to 1907.

Former Delta Township Supervisor Ken Fletcher unofficially won back his seat.
The Democrat, who was supervisor for more than a decade, is accused of engaging in sexually explicit conversations with an officer posing as a 15-year-old boy on the dating app Grindr, following a sting conducted by regional, state and local law enforcement agencies.

Police said the conversation later shifted off the app to text messages, where Fletcher expressed his desire to meet the teen decoy at the Lansing Mall to talk, though he never arranged a get-together, according to court documents obtained by WILX 10 News.

<text>Dimondale is a village in Eaton County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,234 at the 2010 census. The village is located within Windsor Charter Township. Dimondale is a suburb of Lansing, which is northeast of the village in Ingham County.

==History==
The Potawatomi originally had a permanent camp along the Grand River in the Dimondale area before white settlement began in the 1830s. Relations between white settlers (most of whom were from New York and New England) and the Potowatomie were generally cordial with local residents permanently deeding of land near the river to the local Indians. The local band held the deed to the leased land until the Potowatomie were forced west by the Indian Removal Act.
Isaac M. Dimond came to the area in 1848 and, as one of his enterprises, in 1850 began to construct a dam, just east of Silver Creek on the Grand River near the center of section 15 of Windsor Township. By 1852, the dam was completed and a saw mill was in operation. He built a grist mill in 1856. On August 6, 1856, Hosey Harvey surveyed the village in order for Dimond to have it platted with the name &quot;Dimondale&quot;. An unusual feature of the village plat was that its streets ran Northeast to Southwest (e.g., Bridge St.) and Northwest to Southeast, while most roads in the surrounding area in Michigan ran north–south and east–west. Its borders make a rough diamond shape on a map.

A post office named &quot;East Windsor&quot; had been established in the eastern part of Windsor Township in about 1860. This office was transferred to Dimondale and renamed in 1872. In 1878 the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway came through and the area was given a station referring to it as Dimondale. By 1880 the settlement had seven shops: a sawmill, a grist mill, two millinery shops, a planing mill, and several machine shops. In 1906, Dimondale incorporated as a village.
From 1929 to 1963, Dimondale had its own high school, until it merged with the Holt School District. This occurred after the school district ran into tax issues due to the sparse business landscape in the village. The final Superintendent for Dimondale was Harvey E. Wood, a school administrator who later moved to Holt&#x27;s system as the Transportation Manager, then eventually to Ingham Intermediate School District (IISD) as Vice Superintendent. Dimondale almost merged with the Eaton Rapids School district, however due to Mr. Wood&#x27;s prior mentor/student relationship with Holt&#x27;s Superintendent (Maurice Pernert), the merge with Holt&#x27;s school system took place.

In 1962, Interstate 96 was built through Windsor Township, bringing many new businesses to the area.

In the 1960s–70s, Dimondale served as a regionally and nationally recognized hotspot for championship horseshoe pitching, earning it the nickname &quot;Horseshoe Capital of the World.&quot; The Dimondale Horseshoe Club was founded in 1964 and the village played host to the 1965 Michigan state tournament. In 1970, DHC merged with the Chief Okemos Sportsman&#x27;s Club, which is still in existence. Dimondale natives and accomplished horseshoe pitchers James Compton, Gilbert Kimball, Pat Smith, Victor Benson, Fred Smith Sr., and Fred Smith Jr. have been inducted into the Wolverine State Horseshoe Pitcher&#x27;s Association (WSHPA) Hall of Fame. The greatest horseshoe pitching legend emanating from the clay courts of Dimondale tells how Fred Smith Jr. would have his brother Norman place his chin atop an opposing stake while Fred would proceed to pitch ringers that would clang just inches below Norman&#x27;s smiling face.

<doc id="117407" wikidata="Q1351880" url="?curid=117407" title="Southern Baptist Convention">
<text>The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), alternatively the Great Commission Baptists (GCB), is a Christian denomination based in the United States. It is the world&#x27;s largest Baptist organization, the largest Protestant, and the second-largest Christian body in the United States. The SBC is a cooperation of fully autonomous, independent churches with commonly held essential beliefs that pool some resources for missions.

Churches affiliated with the denomination are evangelical in doctrine and practice, emphasizing the significance of the individual conversion experience. This conversion is then affirmed by the person being completely immersed in water for a believer&#x27;s baptism. Baptism is believed to be separate from salvation and is a public and symbolic expression of faith, burial of previous life, and resurrection to new life; it is not a requirement for salvation. The denomination has a male pastorate, often citing 1 Timothy 2:12 as the reason it does not ordain women. All affiliated churches deny the legitimacy of same-sex marriage, saying that marriage can only be between a man and a woman and also that all sexual relations should occur only within the confines of marriage. Other specific beliefs based on biblical interpretation vary by congregational polity, often to balance local church autonomy.

In 1845, the Southern Baptists separated from the Triennial Convention, as American society divided over racial attitudes and slavery. In 1995, the denomination apologized for racial positions in its history, and at present, the Southern Baptist Convention is racially diverse, with one in four congregations having a nonwhite majority. Since the 1940s, it has spread across the United States, with tens of thousands of affiliated churches and 41 affiliated state conventions. Beginning in the late 1970s, a conservative movement began to take control of the organization. By the 1990s, this movement had succeeded in taking control of the leadership of the SBC.

Self-reported membership peaked in 2006 at roughly 16 million. Membership has contracted by an estimated 13.6% since that year, with 2020 marking the 14th year of continuous decline. Mean organization-wide weekly attendance dropped about 27% between 2006 and 2020. The denomination reported increased participation and a slowing of the rate of overall membership decline for the year 2023. For the same year, it reported nearly 13 million members.

== Name ==
The official name is the &quot;Southern Baptist Convention&quot;. The word &quot;Southern&quot; in &quot;Southern Baptist Convention&quot; stems from its 1845 organization in Augusta, Georgia, by white Baptists in the Southern United States who supported continuing the institution of slavery and split from the northern Baptists (known today as the American Baptist Churches USA), who did not support funding evangelists engaging in slavery in the Southern United States.

In 2012, the organization adopted the descriptor &quot;Great Commission Baptists&quot; after the election of its first African American president. Additionally, in 2020, some leaders of the Southern Baptists wanted to change its name to &quot;Great Commission Baptists&quot; to distance itself from its white supremacist foundation, and because it is no longer a specifically Southern church. Several churches affiliated with the denomination have also begun to identify as &quot;Great Commission Baptists&quot;.

==History==
===Colonial era===

Most early Baptists in the British colonies came from England in the 17th century, after conflict with the Church of England for their dissenting religious views. In 1638, Roger Williams founded the first Baptist church in British America at the Providence Plantations, the first permanent European American settlement also founded by Williams in Rhode Island. The oldest Baptist church in the South, First Baptist Church of Charleston, South Carolina, was organized in 1682 under the leadership of William Screven. A Baptist church was formed in Virginia in 1715 through the preaching of Robert Norden and another in North Carolina in 1727 through the ministry of Paul Palmer.

The Baptists adhered to a congregationalist polity. They operated independently of the state-established Anglican churches in the Southern United States at a time when states prohibited non-Anglicans from holding political office. By 1740, about eight Baptist churches existed in the colonies of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, with an estimated 300 to 400 members. New members, both black and white, were converted chiefly by Baptist preachers who traveled throughout the Southern United States during the 18th and 19th centuries, in the eras of the First and Second Great Awakenings.

Black churches were founded in Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia before the American Revolution. Some black congregations kept their independence even after whites tried to exercise more authority after Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion of 1831.

===American Revolution period===
Before the American Revolution, Baptist and Methodist evangelicals in the Southern United States promoted the view of the common person&#x27;s equality before God, which embraced enslaved people and free blacks. They challenged the hierarchies of class and race and urged planters to abolish slavery. They welcomed enslaved people as Baptists and accepted them as preachers.

During this time, there was a sharp division between the austerity of the plain-living Baptists, attracted initially from yeomen and common planters, and the opulence of the Anglican planters—the enslaving elite who controlled local and colonial government in what had become an enslaved society by the late 18th century. The gentry interpreted Baptist church discipline as political radicalism, but it served to ameliorate disorder. The Baptists intensely monitored each other&#x27;s moral conduct, watching especially for sexual transgressions, cursing, and excessive drinking; they expelled members who would not reform.

In Virginia and most southern colonies before the American Revolution, the Church of England was the established church and supported by general taxes, as it was in England. It opposed the rapid spread of Baptists in the Southern United States. Particularly, Virginia prosecuted many Baptist preachers for &quot;disturbing the peace&quot; by preaching without licenses from the Anglican Church. Patrick Henry and James Madison defended Baptist preachers before the American Revolution in cases considered significant in the history of religious freedom. In 1779, Thomas Jefferson wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, enacted in 1786 by the Virginia General Assembly. Madison later applied his ideas and those of the Virginia document related to religious freedom during the Constitutional Convention, when he ensured that delegates incorporated them into the United States Constitution.

The struggle for religious tolerance erupted during the American Revolution, as the Baptists worked to disestablish the Anglican churches in the South. The Baptists protested vigorously; the resulting social disorder resulted chiefly from the ruling gentry&#x27;s disregard for public needs. The vitality of the religious opposition made the conflict between &quot;evangelical&quot; and &quot;gentry&quot; styles bitter. Scholarship suggests that the evangelical movement&#x27;s strength determined its ability to mobilize power outside the conventional authority structure.

===National unification and regional division===

In 1814, leaders such as Luther Rice helped Baptists unify nationally under what became known informally as the Triennial Convention (because it met every three years) based in Philadelphia. It allowed them to join their resources to support missions abroad. The Home Mission Society, affiliated with the Triennial Convention, was established in 1832 to support missions in U.S. frontier territories. By the mid-19th century, there were many social, cultural, economic, and political differences among business owners of the North, farmers of the West, and planters of the South. The most divisive conflict was primarily over the issue of slavery and, secondarily, over missions.

====Divisions over slavery====

The issues surrounding slavery dominated the 19th century in the United States. This created tension between Baptists in northern and southern U.S. states over the issue of manumission. In the two decades after the American Revolution during the Second Great Awakening, northern Baptist preachers (as well as the Quakers and Methodists) increasingly argued that enslavers must free the people they enslaved. Although most Baptists in the 19th century south were yeomen farmers and common planters, the Baptists also began to attract major planters among their membership. The southern pastors interpreted the Bible as supporting slavery and encouraged paternalistic practices by enslavers. They preached to enslaved people to accept their places and obey their enslavers and welcomed enslaved people and free blacks as members; whites controlled the churches&#x27; leadership and usually segregated church seating. From the early 19th century, many Baptist preachers in the Southern United States also argued in favor of preserving the right of ministers to be enslavers.

Black congregations were sometimes the largest in their regions. For instance, by 1821, Gillfield Baptist in Petersburg, Virginia, had the largest congregation within the Portsmouth Association. At 441 members, it was more than twice as large as the next-biggest church. Before Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion of 1831, Gillfield had a black preacher. Afterward, the state legislature insisted that white men oversee black congregations. Gillfield could not call a black preacher until after the American Civil War and emancipation. After Turner&#x27;s rebellion, whites worked to exert more control over black congregations and passed laws requiring white ministers to lead or be present at religious meetings. Many enslaved people evaded these restrictions.

The Triennial Convention and the Home Mission Society adopted a kind of neutrality concerning slavery, neither condoning nor condemning it. During the &quot;Georgia Test Case&quot; of 1844, the Georgia State Convention proposed the appointment of the enslaver Elder James E. Reeve as a missionary. The Foreign Mission Board refused to approve his appointment, recognizing the case as a challenge and not wanting to violate their neutrality on slavery. They said that slavery should not be a factor in deliberations about missionary appointments.

In 1844, University of Alabama president Basil Manly Sr., a prominent preacher and major planter who enslaved 40 people, drafted the &quot;Alabama Resolutions&quot; and presented them to the Triennial Convention. They included the demand that enslavers be eligible for denominational offices to which the Southern associations contributed financially. They were not adopted. Georgia Baptists decided to test the claimed neutrality by recommending an enslaver to the Home Mission Society as a missionary. The Home Mission Society&#x27;s board refused to appoint him, noting that missionaries were not allowed to take servants with them (so he clearly could not enslave people) and that they would not make a decision that appeared to endorse slavery. Southern Baptists considered this an infringement of their right to determine candidates. From the Southern perspective, the Northern position that &quot;slaveholding brethren were less than followers of Jesus&quot; effectively obligated enslavers to leave the fellowship. This difference came to a head in 1845 when representatives of the northern states refused to appoint missionaries whose families enslaved people. To continue in the work of missions, the southern Baptists separated and created the Southern Baptist Convention.

====Missions and organization====

A secondary issue that disturbed the Southerners was the perception that the American Baptist Home Mission Society did not appoint a proportionate number of missionaries to the South. This was likely a result of the society&#x27;s not appointing enslavers as missionaries. Baptists in the North preferred a loosely structured society of individuals who paid annual dues, with each society usually focused on a single ministry.

Baptists in Southern churches preferred a more centralized organization of churches patterned after their associations, with a variety of ministries brought under the direction of one denominational organization. The increasing tensions and the discontent of Baptists from the Southern United States over national criticism of slavery and issues over missions led to their withdrawal from national Baptist organizations.

The Southern Baptists met at the First Baptist Church of Augusta in May 1845. At this meeting, they created a new convention—the Southern Baptist Convention. They elected William Bullein Johnson (1782–1862) as its first president. He had served as president of the Triennial Convention in 1841, though he initially attempted to avoid a schism.

===Formation and separation of black Baptists===

African Americans had gathered in their own churches early on, in 1774 in Petersburg, Virginia, and in Savannah, Georgia, in 1788. Some established churches after 1800 on the frontier, such as the First African Baptist Church of Lexington, Kentucky. In 1824, the Elkhorn Association of Kentucky, which was white-dominated, accepted it. By 1850, First African had 1,820 members, the largest of any Baptist church in the state, black or white. In 1861, it had 2,223 members.

Southern whites generally required black churches to have white ministers and trustees. In churches with mixed congregations, seating was segregated, with blacks out of sight, often in a balcony. White preaching often emphasized Biblical stipulations that enslaved people should accept their places and try to behave well toward their enslavers. After the American Civil War, another split occurred when most freedmen set up independent black congregations, regional associations, and state and national conventions. Black people wanted to practice Christianity independently of white supervision. They interpreted the Bible as offering hope for deliverance and saw their exodus out of enslavement as comparable to the Exodus, with abolitionist John Brown as their Moses. They quickly left white-dominated churches and associations and set up separate state Baptist conventions. In 1866, black Baptists of the Southern and Western United States combined to form the Consolidated American Baptist Convention. In 1895, they merged three national conventions to create the National Baptist Convention, USA. With more than eight million members, it is today the largest African American religious organization and second in size to the Southern Baptists.

Free black people in the North founded churches and denominations in the early 19th century independent of white-dominated organizations. In the Reconstruction era, missionaries, both black and white, from several northern denominations worked in the South; they quickly attracted tens and hundreds of thousands of new members from among the millions of freedmen. The African Methodist Episcopal Church attracted more new members than any other denomination. White Southern Baptist churches lost black members to the new denominations, as well as to independent congregations which freedmen organized.

During the civil rights movement, many Southern Baptist pastors and members of their congregations rejected racial integration and accepted white supremacy, further alienating African Americans. According to historian and former Southern Baptist Wayne Flynt, &quot;The [Southern Baptist] church was the last bastion of segregation.&quot; SBC did not integrate seminary classrooms until 1951.

In 1995, the convention voted to adopt a resolution in which it renounced its racist roots and apologized for its past defense of slavery, segregation, and white supremacy. This marked the denomination&#x27;s first formal acknowledgment that racism had played a profound role in both its early and modern history.

===Increasing diversity and policy changes===

By the early 21st century, the number of ethnically diverse congregations was increasing among the Southern Baptists. In 2008, almost 20% of the congregations were majority African American, Asian, Hispanic, or Latino. SBC cooperating churches had an estimated one million African American members. It has passed a series of resolutions recommending including more black members and appointing more African American leaders. At its 2012 annual meeting, it elected Pastor Fred Luter of the Franklin Avenue Baptist Church as its first African American president. He had earned respect by showing leadership skills in building a large congregation in New Orleans.

The SBC&#x27;s increasingly national scope inspired some members to suggest a name change. In 2005, some members made proposals at the SBC Annual Meeting to change the name to the more national-sounding &quot;North American Baptist Convention&quot; or &quot;Scriptural Baptist Convention&quot; (to retain the SBC initials). These proposals were defeated.

The messengers of the 2012 annual meeting in New Orleans voted to adopt the descriptor &quot;Great Commission Baptists&quot;. The legal name remained &quot;Southern Baptist Convention&quot;, but affiliated churches and convention entities could voluntarily use the descriptor.

Almost a year after the Charleston church shooting, the denomination approved a resolution that called upon member churches and families to stop flying the Confederate flag.

The church approved a resolution, &quot;On Refugee Ministry&quot;, encouraging member churches and families to welcome refugees coming to the United States. In the same convention, Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission quickly responded to a pastor who asked why a member should support the right of Muslims living in the U.S. to build mosques. Moore replied, &quot;Sometimes we have to deal with questions that are really complicated... this isn&#x27;t one of them.&quot; Moore said that religious freedom must be for all religions.

From February to June 2016, the denomination collaborated with the National Baptist Convention, USA, on racial reconciliation. SBC-GCB and NBC presidents Ronnie Floyd and Jerry Young assembled ten pastors from each convention in 2015, discussing race relations; in 2016, &quot;Baptist Press&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed tension among National Baptists debating any collaboration with Southern Baptists, quoting NBC President Young:

After an initial resolution denouncing the alt-right movement failed to make it to the convention floor, the denomination officially denounced the alt-right movement at the 2017 convention. On November 5, 2017, a mass shooting took place at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. It was the deadliest shooting to occur at any affiliated church in its history and, in modern history, at an American place of worship.

In 2020, the denomination canceled its convention due to COVID-19 concerns and eventually rescheduled for June 2021.

In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; story dated September 15, 2020, Greear said some Southern Baptist Convention leaders wanted to change the official name of the church to &quot;Great Commission Baptists&quot; (GCB), to distance the church from its support of slavery and because it is no longer just a Southern church. Since then, several leaders and churches have begun adopting the alternative descriptor for their churches.

=== Sexual abuse scandal ===
In 2018, investigations showed that the SBC suppressed reports of sexual abuse and protected over 700 accused ministers and church workers. In 2022, a report indicated church leaders had stonewalled and disparaged clergy sex abuse survivors for nearly two decades; reform efforts had been met with criticism or dismissal from other organization leaders; and known abusers had been allowed to keep their positions without informing their local churches. On August 12, 2022, the denomination announced that it was facing a federal investigation into the scandal.

On February 10, 2019, a joint investigation by the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;San Antonio Express&quot; found that there had been over 700 victims of sexual abuse by nearly 400 Southern Baptist church leaders, pastors, and volunteers over the previous 20 years.

In 2018, the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; verified details of hundreds of accounts of abuse. It examined federal and state court databases, prison records, and official documents from more than 20 states and researched sex offender registries nationwide. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; compiled a list of records and information (current as of June 2019) listing church pastors, leaders, employees, and volunteers who have pleaded guilty to or were convicted of sex crimes.

On June 12, 2019, during their annual meeting, convention messengers, who assembled that year in Birmingham, Alabama, approved a resolution condemning sex abuse and establishing a special committee to investigate sex abuse, which will make it easier for the convention to excommunicate churches. The Reverend J. D. Greear, president of the convention and pastor of The Summit Church in Durham, North Carolina, called the move a &quot;defining moment&quot;. Ronnie Floyd, president of the convention&#x27;s executive committee, echoed Greear&#x27;s remarks, calling the vote &quot;a very, very significant moment in the history of the Southern Baptist Convention&quot;.

In June 2021, letters from former policy director Russell D. Moore to convention leadership were leaked. In the letters, Moore described how the convention had mishandled claims of sexual abuse.

On May 22, 2022, Guidepost Solutions, an independent firm contracted by the organization&#x27;s executive committee, released a report detailing that church leaders had stonewalled and disparaged clergy sex abuse survivors for nearly two decades. It was then the most extensive investigation undertaken in the convention&#x27;s history, with $4 million reportedly spent by the organization to fund the inquiry. The report also found that known abusers were allowed to keep their positions without informing their church or congregation. The report alleged that while the convention had elected a president, J. D. Greear, in 2018 who made addressing sexual abuse a central part of his agenda, nearly all efforts at reform had been met with criticism and dismissal by other organization leaders.

On June 14, 2022, the denomination voted &quot;to create a way to track pastors and other church workers credibly accused of sex abuse and launch a new task force to oversee further reforms&quot; after a consultant exposed that &quot;Southern Baptist leaders mishandled abuse cases and stonewalled victims for years&quot;. The new task force will operate for one year, with the option to continue longer.

On August 12, 2022, the organization announced that it was facing a federal investigation into the sex abuse scandal. As revelations of sexual abuse and lawsuits continued to emerge in 2023, the SBC&#x27;s Abuse Reform Implementation Task Force announced continued development of the database of sexual offenders.

==Doctrine==

The Baptist Faith and Message (BF&amp;M) represents the general theological perspective of the denomination&#x27;s churches. The convention first drafted the BF&amp;M in 1925 as a revision of the 1833 New Hampshire Confession of Faith. The convention revised the BF&amp;M significantly in 1963, amended it in 1998 to add one new section on the family, and revised it again in 2000. The 1998 and 2000 changes were the subject of much controversy, particularly regarding the role of women in the church.

The BF&amp;M is not a creed, such as the Nicene Creed. Members are not required to adhere to it, and churches and state conventions belonging to the global body are not required to use it as their statement of faith or doctrine, though many do in lieu of creating their own statement. Nevertheless, key leaders, faculty in denomination-owned seminaries, and missionaries who apply to serve through the various missionary agencies must affirm that their practices, doctrine, and preaching are consistent with the BF&amp;M.

In 2012, a LifeWay Research survey of the denomination&#x27;s pastors found that 30% of churches identified with the labels Calvinist or Reformed, while 30% identified with the labels Arminian or Wesleyan. LifeWay Research President Ed Stetzer said, &quot;historically, many Baptists have considered themselves neither Calvinist nor Arminian, but holding a unique theological approach not framed well by either category&quot;. The survey also found that 60% of its pastors were concerned about Calvinism&#x27;s impact within the convention. Nathan Finn writes that the debate over Calvinism has &quot;periodically reignited with increasing intensity&quot; and that non-Calvinists &quot;seem to be especially concerned with the influence of Founders Ministries&quot; while Calvinists &quot;seem to be particularly concerned with the influence of revivalism and Keswick theology.&quot;

Historically, the denomination has not considered glossolalia or other Charismatic beliefs to be in accordance with Scriptural teaching, though the BF&amp;M does not mention the subject. In 2015, the International Mission Board lifted a ban on glossolalia for its missionaries while reaffirming that it should not be taught as normative.

The convention brings together fundamentalist and moderate churches.

===Position statements===

In addition to the BF&amp;M, the denomination has also issued position statements affirming the autonomy of the local church; identifying the Cooperative Program of missions as integral to the denomination; that statements of belief are revisable in light of Scripture, though the Bible is the final word; honoring the indigenous principle in missions without compromising doctrine or its identity for missional opportunities; that laypersons have the same right as ordained ministers to communicate with God, interpret Scripture, and minister in Christ&#x27;s name; that &quot;At the moment of conception, a new being enters the universe, a human being, a being created in God&#x27;s image&quot;, who as such should be protected regardless of the circumstances of the conception; that God&#x27;s plan for marriage and sexual intimacy is a lifetime relationship of one man and one woman, rejecting homosexuality; understanding the Bible to forbid any form of extramarital sexual relations; affirming the accountability of each person before God; and that women are not eligible to serve as pastors.

In 2022, it passed a resolution against prosperity theology, which it considers a heretical distortion of the message of the Bible.

==== Abortion ====
The position of many Southern Baptists on abortion has changed significantly over time, evolving from acceptance under certain circumstances to firm opposition.

In 1971, the SBC passed a resolution urging a loosening of U.S. abortion laws, stating:Be it further resolved, that we call upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.In 1973, a &quot;poll conducted by the &quot;Baptist Standard&quot; news journal found that 90 percent of Texas Baptists believed their state&#x27;s abortion laws were too restrictive&quot;.

During this era, a majority of Southern Baptists, including a few conservatives within the denomination, supported a moderate expansion of abortion rights, seeing it as a matter of religious liberty, what they saw as a lack of biblical condemnation, and belief in non-intrusive government. Southern Baptists&#x27; and evangelicals&#x27; initial reaction to &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision was one of support or indifference; they overwhelmingly viewed anti-abortion movements as a sectarian and Catholic concern. By the mid-1970s, this began to change, as a movement that sought to change Southern Baptists&#x27; opinions on abortion began to incline them against it substantially. Over that period, the SBC changed in other ways as well. Today, the SBC strongly opposes abortion.

==== Gender-based roles ====
Officially, the denomination subscribes to the complementarian view of gender roles. Beginning in the early 1970s, as a reaction to their perceptions of various &quot;women&#x27;s liberation movements&quot;, the church, along with several other historically conservative Baptist groups, began to assert its view of the propriety and primacy of what it deemed &quot;traditional gender roles&quot; as a body. In 1973, at the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, delegates passed a resolution that read in part: &quot;Man was not made for woman, but the woman for the man. Woman is the glory of man. Woman would not have existed without man.&quot; In 1998, the convention appended a male leadership understanding of marriage to the 1963 version of the Baptist Faith and Message, with an official amendment: Article XVIII, &quot;The Family&quot;. In 2000, it revised the document to reflect support for a male-only pastorate with no mention of the office of deacon.

In 1984, when it had about 250 women pastors, the Convention adopted a resolution affirming the exclusion of women from pastoral leadership.

Since 1987, various local associations and regional conventions have considered churches that have authorized the pastoral ministry of women to not be in friendly cooperation (or &quot;disfellowshipped&quot;) without the intervention of the national convention on the subject.

By explicitly defining the pastoral office as the exclusive domain of males, the 2000 BF&amp;M provision became the Southern Baptist&#x27;s first-ever official position against women pastors. As individual churches affiliated with the organization are autonomous, churches cannot be forced to adopt a male-only pastorate.

Some churches that have installed women as their pastors have been disfellowshipped from membership in their local associations; a smaller number have been disfellowshipped from their affiliated state conventions. In February 2023, the Executive Committee for the first time deemed five churches that had appointed women pastors to not be in friendly cooperation. In June 2023, when two churches requested a review of the decision, 88% of church representatives at the annual convention voted to uphold the decision. &quot;American Reformer&quot; magazine estimated the convention would have 1,844 female pastors in 2023.

The crystallization of the church&#x27;s positions on gender roles and restrictions on women&#x27;s participation in the pastorate contributed to the decision by members now belonging to the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, which broke from the convention in 1991. Another denomination that broke off, the Alliance of Baptists, also accepts women&#x27;s ordination.

The 2000 BF&amp;M prescribes a husband-headship authority structure, closely following the apostle Paul&#x27;s exhortations in :

===Ordinances===

Southern/Great Commission Baptists observe two ordinances: the Lord&#x27;s Supper and believer&#x27;s baptism (also known as &quot;credo&quot;-baptism, from the Latin for &quot;I believe&quot;). Furthermore, they hold the historic Baptist belief that immersion is the only valid mode of baptism. The Baptist Faith and Message describes baptism as a symbolic act of obedience and a testimony of the believer&#x27;s faith in Jesus Christ to other people. The BF&amp;M also notes that baptism is a precondition to congregational church membership.

The BF&amp;M holds to memorialism, the belief that the Lord&#x27;s Supper is a symbolic act of obedience in which believers commemorate the death of Christ and look forward to his Second Coming. Individual churches are free to practice either open or closed communion (due to the convention&#x27;s belief in congregational polity and the autonomy of the local church), but most practice open communion. For the same reason, the frequency of observance of the Lord&#x27;s Supper varies from church to church. Churches commonly observe it quarterly, but some churches offer it monthly; a small minority offer it weekly. Because the organization has traditionally opposed alcoholic beverage consumption by members, grape juice is used instead of wine.

=== Worship ===
Most members observe a low church form of worship, which is less formal and uses no stated liturgy. The form of the worship services generally depends on whether the congregation uses a traditional or a contemporary service, or a mix of both—the main differences concerning music and the response to the sermon.

In both types of services, there will be a prayer at the opening of the service, before the sermon, and at closing. Offerings are taken, which may be around the middle of the service or at the end (with the increased popularity of electronic financial systems, some churches operate kiosks allowing givers the opportunity to do so online or through a phone app or website link). Responsive Scripture readings are uncommon but may be done on a special occasion.

In a traditional service, the music typically features hymns accompanied by a piano or organ (churches have generally phased out the latter due to a shift in worship preferences) and sometimes with a special featured soloist or choir. Smaller churches typically let anyone participate in the choir regardless of actual singing ability; larger churches will limit participation to those who have successfully tried out for a role. After the sermon, an invitation to respond (sometimes termed an altar call) might be given; people may respond during the invitation by receiving Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and beginning Christian discipleship, seeking baptism or requesting to join the congregation, or entering into vocational ministry or making some other publicly stated decision. Churches may schedule baptisms on specific weekends, or (especially in buildings with built-in baptisteries) be readily available for anyone desiring baptism.

In a contemporary service, the music generally features modern songs led by a praise team or similarly named group with featured singers. Choirs are not as common. An altar call may or may not be given at the end; if not, interested persons are directed to seek out people in the lobby who can address any questions. Baptismal services are usually scheduled as specific and special events. Also, church membership is usually done periodically by attending specific classes about the church&#x27;s history, beliefs, what it seeks to accomplish, and what is expected of a prospective member. Controversially, churches may ask a member to sign a &quot;membership covenant&quot;, a document with the prospective member&#x27;s promise to perform certain tasks (regular church attendance at main services and small groups, regular giving—sometimes even requiring tithing, and service within the church). Such covenants are highly controversial: among other things, such a covenant may not permit a member to withdraw from membership to avoid church discipline voluntarily, or, in some cases, the member cannot leave at all (even when not under discipline) without the approval of church leadership. A Dallas/Fort Worth church was forced to apologize to a member who attempted to do so for failing to request permission to annul her marriage after her husband admitted to viewing child pornography.

==Statistics==

===Membership===
According to a 2024 census published by the convention, the organization claimed 46,906 churches, 4,050,668 weekly worshippers, and 12,982,090 members.

The global convention has more than 1,161 local associations, 41 state conventions, and fellowships covering all 50 states and territories of the United States. The five U.S. states with the highest rates of membership are Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee. Texas has the largest number of members, with an estimated 2.75 million. Within Texas, these are divided among the more traditionalist Southern Baptists of Texas Convention and more moderate, diversified Baptist General Convention of Texas; the Baptist General Convention of Texas, or the Texas Baptists, are also more financially and organizationally autonomous from the primary convention in contrast to most state conventions.

Southern/Great Commission Baptists support thousands of missionaries in the United States and worldwide through the Cooperative Program.

===Trends===
Data from church sources and independent surveys indicate that since 1990 membership of Southern Baptist churches has declined as a proportion of the American population. Historically, the convention grew throughout its history until 2007, when membership decreased by a net figure of nearly 40,000 members. The total membership, of about 16.2 million, was flat over the same period, falling by 38,482 or 0.2%. An important indicator of the denomination&#x27;s health is new baptisms, which have decreased yearly for seven of the last eight years. , they had reached their lowest levels since 1987. Membership continued to decline from 2008 to 2012. The convention&#x27;s statistical summary of 2014 recorded a loss of 236,467 members, their biggest one-year decline since 1881. In 2018, membership fell below 15 million for the first time since 1989 and reached its lowest level for over 30 years.

This decline in membership and baptisms has prompted some SBC researchers to describe the convention as a &quot;denomination in decline&quot;. In 2008, former SBC president Frank Page suggested that if current conditions continue, half of all the convention&#x27;s churches will close their doors permanently by 2030. A 2004 survey of SBC churches supported that assessment, finding that the membership of 70% of SBC churches is declining or has plateaued.

The decline in membership was discussed at the June 2008 Annual Convention. Curt Watke, a former researcher for the organization, noted four reasons for the decline of the church based on his research: the increase in immigration by non-European groups, decline in growth among predominantly European American (white) churches, the aging of the current membership, and a decrease in the proportion of younger generations participating in any church life. Some believe Baptists have not worked sufficiently to attract minorities.

On the other hand, the state conventions of Mississippi and Texas report an increasing proportion of minority members. In 1990, 5% of congregations were non-white. In 2012, the proportion of congregations of other ethnic groups (African American, Latino, and Asian) had increased to 20%. Sixty percent of the minority congregations were in Texas, particularly in the suburbs of Houston and Dallas. In 2020, an estimated 22.3% of affiliated churches were non-white.

The decline in SBC-GCB membership may be more pronounced than these statistics indicate because Baptist churches are not required to remove inactive members from their rolls, likely leading to greatly inflated membership numbers. In addition, hundreds of large, moderate congregations have shifted their primary allegiance to other Baptist groups, such as the American Baptist Churches USA, the Alliance of Baptists, or the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, but have continued to remain on the convention&#x27;s books. Their members are thus counted in the convention&#x27;s totals, although these churches no longer participate in the annual convention meetings or make more than the minimum financial contributions.

Groups have sometimes withdrawn from the convention because of its conservative trends. On November 6, 2000, the Baptist General Convention of Texas voted to cut its contributions to Southern Baptist seminaries and reallocate more than $5 million to three theological seminaries that members believed were more moderate. These included the Hispanic Baptist Theological School in San Antonio, Baylor University&#x27;s George W. Truett Theological Seminary in Waco, and Hardin–Simmons University&#x27;s Logsdon School of Theology in Abilene. Since the controversies of the 1980s, the convention has established more than 20 theological or divinity programs directed toward moderate and progressive Baptists in the Southeastern United States. In addition to Texas, the convention established schools in Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama in the 1990s. These include the Baptist Theological Seminary in Richmond, McAfee School of Theology of Mercer University in Atlanta, Wake Forest, Gardner Webb and Campbell Divinity schools in North Carolina, and Beeson Divinity School at Samford University. These schools contributed to the flat and declining enrollment at seminaries operating in the same region of the United States. Texas and Virginia have the largest state conventions identified as moderate in theological approach.

On June 4, 2020, the organization reported a drop in membership—the 13th consecutive year that membership declined. Total membership in the church fell almost 2% to 14,525,579 from 2018 to 2019. In 2022, the church lost another 457,371 members (the largest drop in over a century) to 13,223,122, a similar level as the late 1970s.

==Organization==
The denomination has four levels of organization: the local congregation, the local association, the state convention, and the national convention. There are 41 affiliated state conventions or fellowships.

The national and state conventions and local associations are cooperative associations by which churches can voluntarily pool resources to support missionary and other work. Because of the basic Baptist principle of the autonomy of the local church and the congregationalist polity of the denomination, neither the national convention nor the state conventions or local associations has any administrative or ecclesiastical control over local churches; such a group may disfellowship a local congregation over an issue, but may not terminate its leadership or members or force its closure. The national convention has no authority over state conventions or local associations, nor do state conventions have authority over local associations. Furthermore, no individual congregation has any authority over any other congregation; a church may oversee another congregation voluntarily as a mission work, but another congregation has the right to become an independent congregation at any time.

The national convention maintains a central administrative organization in Nashville, Tennessee. Its executive committee exercises authority and control over seminaries and other institutions owned by the national convention.

The national convention had around 10,000 ethnic churches as of 2008. Commitment to the autonomy of local churches was the primary force behind its executive committee&#x27;s rejection of a proposal to create a convention-wide database of clergy accused of sexual crimes against congregants or other minors in order to stop the &quot;recurring tide&quot; of clergy sexual abuse within affiliated congregations. A 2009 study by Lifeway Christian Resources, the convention&#x27;s research and publishing arm, revealed that one in eight background checks for potential volunteer or church workers revealed a history of crime that could have prevented them from working.

The denominational statement of faith, the Baptist Faith and Message, is not binding on churches or members due to the autonomy of the local church (though national convention employees and missionaries must agree to its views as a condition of employment or missionary support). Politically and culturally, Southern/Great Commission Baptists tend to be conservative. Most oppose homosexual activity and abortion.

===Pastor and deacon===
Generally, Baptists recognize only two scriptural offices: pastor-teacher and deacon. The convention passed a resolution in the early 1980s officially restricting offices requiring ordination to men. According to the Baptist Faith and Message, the office of &quot;pastor&quot; is limited to men based on New Testament scriptures.

===Annual meeting===

The annual meeting (held in June over two days) consists of delegates (called &quot;messengers&quot;) from cooperating churches. The messengers confer, determine the convention&#x27;s programs, policies, and budget, and elect the officers and committees. Each cooperating church is allowed up to two messengers regardless of the amount given to convention entities and may have more depending on the amount of contributions (in dollars or percent of the church&#x27;s budget), but the maximum number of messengers permitted from any church is 12.

==Missions and affiliated organizations==

===Cooperative Program===
The Cooperative Program (CP) is the organization&#x27;s unified funds collection and distribution program for the support of regional, national, and international ministries; contributions from affiliated congregations fund the CP.

In the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, the local congregations of the denomination reported gift receipts of $11.1 billion. From this they sent $548 million, approximately five percent, to their state Baptist conventions through the CP. Of this amount, the state Baptist conventions retained $344 million for their work. State conventions sent $204 million to the national CP budget to support denomination-wide ministries.

===Mission agencies===
The denomination was organized in 1845 to create a mission board to support the sending of Baptist missionaries. The North American Mission Board, or NAMB, (founded as the Domestic Mission Board, and later the Home Mission Board) in Alpharetta, Georgia serves missionaries involved in evangelism and church planting in the U.S. and Canada, while the International Mission Board, or IMB, (originally the Foreign Mission Board) in Richmond, Virginia, sponsors missionaries to the rest of the world.

Baptist Men is the mission organization for men in the convention&#x27;s churches and is under the North American Mission Board.

The Woman&#x27;s Missionary Union, founded in 1888, is an auxiliary to the national convention, which helps facilitate two large annual missions offerings: the Annie Armstrong Easter Offering (for North American missions) and the Lottie Moon Christmas Offering (for international missions).

===Southern Baptist Disaster Relief===

Among the more visible organizations within the North American Mission Board is Southern Baptist Disaster Relief. In 1967, a small group of Texas Southern Baptist volunteers helped victims of Hurricane Beulah by serving hot food cooked on small &quot;buddy burners&quot;. In 2005, volunteers responded to 166 named disasters, prepared 17,124,738 meals, repaired 7,246 homes, and removed debris from 13,986 yards. Southern Baptist Disaster Relief provides many different types: food, water, child care, communication, showers, laundry, repairs, rebuilding, or other essential tangible items that contribute to the resumption of life following the crisis—and the message of the Gospel. All assistance is provided to individuals and communities free of charge. SBC DR volunteer kitchens prepare much of the food distributed by the Red Cross in major disasters.

===Southern Baptist Association of Christian Schools===
The SBC has various primary and secondary schools affiliated with the Southern Baptist Association of Christian Schools.

===Universities and colleges===
The SBC has several affiliated universities.

===Seminaries===

The national convention directly supports six theological seminaries devoted to ministry preparation.
* Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky (1859, originally in Greenville, South Carolina)
* Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Fort Worth, Texas (1908, originally part of Baylor University in Waco, Texas).
* New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, New Orleans, Louisiana (1916, originally New Orleans Baptist Bible Institute)
* Gateway Seminary, Ontario, California (1944, initially in Oakland, California, and formerly called Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary)
* Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, Wake Forest, North Carolina (1950)
* Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Kansas City, Missouri (1957)

===Other organizations===
Other notable organizations under the national convention include &quot;Baptist Press&quot;, the nation&#x27;s largest Christian news service, established by the convention in 1946; Baptist Collegiate Network, the college-level organization operating campus and international missions typically known as the Baptist Student Union and Baptist Collegiate Ministries; GuideStone Financial Resources (formerly called the Annuity Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, and founded in 1918 as the Relief Board of the Southern Baptist Convention), which provides insurance, retirement, and investment services to churches, ministers, and employees of affiliated churches and agencies (it does not limit its services to member churches and members); LifeWay Christian Resources, founded as the Baptist Sunday School Board in 1891, one of the nation&#x27;s largest Christian publishing houses, which previously operated the &quot;LifeWay Christian Stores&quot; (formerly &quot;Baptist Book Stores&quot;) until closing physical stores in 2019; Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission (formerly known as the Christian Life Commission of the SBC), dedicated to addressing social and moral concerns and their implications on public policy issues from city hall to Congress and the courts; and the Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives, in Nashville, Tennessee, the official depository for the denomination&#x27;s archives and a research center for the study of Baptists worldwide. The SBHLA website includes digital resources.

==Controversies==
From its establishment to the present day, the organization has experienced several periods of major internal controversy.

===Landmark controversy===
In the 1850s–1860s, a group of young activists called for a return to certain early practices, or what they called Landmarkism. Other leaders disagreed with their assertions, and the Baptist congregations became split on the issues. Eventually, the disagreements led to the formation of Gospel Missions and the American Baptist Association (1924), as well as many unaffiliated independent churches. One historian called the related James Robinson Graves—Robert Boyte Crawford Howell controversy (1858–60) the greatest to affect the denomination before that of the late 20th century involving the fundamentalist-moderate break.

===Whitsitt controversy===
In the Whitsitt controversy of 1896–99, William H. Whitsitt, a professor at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, suggested that contrary to earlier thought, English Baptists did not begin to baptize by immersion until 1641, when some Anabaptists, as they were then called, began to practice immersion. This went against the idea of immersion, which was the practice of the earliest Baptists, as some Landmarkists contended.

===American Civil War ===

During the 19th and most of the 20th century, the organization, reflecting Southern attitudes toward politics, supported white supremacy, racial segregation, the Confederacy, and the Lost Cause. The organization also denounced interracial marriage as an &quot;abomination&quot;, falsely citing the Bible. Beginning in the late 1970s, a conservative movement began to take control of the organization. By the 1990s, this movement succeeded in taking control of the SBC leadership. In 1995, it officially denounced racism and its white supremacist history. In the 21st century, after the election of its first black president, the SBC adopted the &quot;Great Commission Baptists&quot; descriptor, which gained prominent use among several churches that wished to sever themselves from its white supremacist history and controversies. By 2008, almost 20% of SBC congregations were majority African American, Asian, Hispanic, or Latino, reflecting the denomination&#x27;s increased racial diversity. SBC-cooperating churches had an estimated one million African American members. By 2018, the denomination had passed resolutions that recommended gaining more black members and appointing more African American leaders. 

===Moderates–conservatives controversy===

The Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence () was an intense struggle for control of the national convention&#x27;s resources and ideological direction.

In July 1961, Professor Ralph Elliott at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City published &quot;The Message of Genesis&quot;, a book rejecting biblical inerrancy. In the 1970s, other convention seminary professors came under suspicion of liberal Christianity.

In response to these events, a group of pastors led by Judge Paul Pressler and Pastor Paige Patterson campaigned at conferences in churches for a more conservative direction in Convention policies. This group&#x27;s candidate, Adrian Rogers, was elected Convention president at the 1979 annual meeting. After the election, the organization&#x27;s new leaders replaced all Southern Baptist agency leaders with people who said they were more conservative. Its initiators called it a &quot;Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence&quot;, while its moderate opponents called it a &quot;fundamentalist takeover&quot;.

Russell H. Dilday, president of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary from 1978 to 1994, said the resurgence fragmented Southern Baptist fellowship and was &quot;far more serious than [a controversy]&quot;, calling it as &quot;a self-destructive, contentious, one-sided feud that at times took on combative characteristics&quot;. Since 1979, Southern Baptists had become polarized into two major groups: moderates and conservatives. Reflecting the conservative majority votes of messengers at the 1979 annual meeting of the SBC, the new national organization officers replaced all leaders of Southern Baptist agencies with presumably more conservative people (often dubbed &quot;fundamentalist&quot; by dissenters).

In 1984, this group was heavily involved in passing a resolution excluding women from pastoral leadership.

In 1987, a group of churches criticized the fundamentalists for controlling the leadership and founded the Alliance of Baptists. A group of moderate churches criticized the denomination for the same reasons, as well as opposition to women&#x27;s ministry, and founded the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship in 1991.

In 2019, after the scandals of sexual abuse accusations involving the deacon Paul Pressler and sexual abuse cover-ups involving former president Paige Patterson, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary removed the stained-glass windows from the MacGorman Chapel opened in 2011 depicting them as actors of a &quot;conservative resurgence&quot;.

=== LGBTQ ===
Since 1992, the national convention has &quot;disfellowshipped&quot; various churches that support LGBTQ inclusion. In 2018, the District of Columbia Baptist Convention was disfellowshipped for this reason.

=== Critical race theory ===
By November 2020, the six convention seminary presidents called critical race theory &quot;unbiblical&quot;. They emphasized the importance of not turning to secular ideas to confront racism. Four African American churches left the SBC over the leadership&#x27;s charged statement on the issue.

<text>Eaton Rapids is a city in Eaton County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 5,214 at the 2010 census.

The city is located in the south of Eaton Rapids Township, on the boundary with Hamlin Township, though it is politically independent of both townships. Its nickname is the &quot;Island City,&quot; since the downtown is located on an island, with a public park, in the Grand River.

== History ==

The Potawatomi people established a village in the area of what is now Eaton Rapids in about 1774. This was part of their wide territory in historic times.

The area constituting Eaton Rapids was first settled by Euro-Americans around the year 1835, who were drawn there because of the timber and water power in the area. It became a center of industry. The following year, a sawmill was constructed near Spring Brook in Spicerville; it provided the lumber settlers used to build Eaton Rapids. In 1837, the Old Red Mill was constructed by the mill company; it used waterpower from the stream to grind corn. The mill company later used wood from Spicerville to construct their own sawmill along the Grand River, as well as a wool carding mill.

In 1852, mineral water was first discovered by E. B. Frost, earning Eaton Rapids worldwide fame and the nickname &quot;The Saratoga of the West,&quot; referring to Saratoga Springs, New York, which had tourism based on such waters. This water was in huge demand, and resulted in many people coming to take mineral water baths, considered to have health benefits, as well as cures from specific ailments. Fourteen wells were drilled in total to supply water for the baths. Only three are still operational.

In 1921, John B. Davidson Sr. came to Eaton Rapids from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He started the only textile mill in Michigan that spun its own yarn. The Davidson Mill supplied 95 percent of the wool yarn for major league baseball uniforms, as well as high-grade yarns for other applications. After 48 years in business, the mill burned in 1969. John B. Davidson became a politician, elected as mayor of Eaton Rapids, and later representing the area in both the State House and State Senate.

In 1927, Irving Jacob Reuter and his wife Janet built Medovue, a 17-room, 10,000-square foot, Tudor Revival- style mansion, where they lived for nine years. President of the Oldsmobile automobile company, Reuter was also a financier and inventor. The Reuters donated substantial sums to charity.

Their property was sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing, and became the private residence of its first bishop, the Most Reverend Joseph H. Albers. The diocese later sold the mansion.

It was purchased by C.J. and Mille Sumner, who adapted it and reopened it to operate as an Adult Foster Care Home. They furnished it with antiques and named it &quot;Ivy Manor&quot;. The home was sold again in 1990 and was renovated for use as a bed and breakfast, known as the English Inn. In 1991 it was recognized and listed in the state List of Registered Historic Places in Michigan. The original building, complete with many of the original antique furnishings, has of gardens and pastoral countryside located on the river. It was purchased by Gary and Donna Nelson in 1996, who also developed a restaurant and pub on the property. It is open to the public for viewing. Their son Erik Nelson has taken over operations.

<text>Cross Village Township is a civil township of Emmet County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 240.

==Communities==
*Cross Village is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in the township on a rise overlooking Lake Michigan at . M-119 has its northern terminus here, with Petoskey about to the south along the Lake Michigan shore.

==History==

This general area was known as &quot;Waganakisi&quot; by the Ottawa people. Cross Village itself was a village known to the Ottawa as &quot;Anamiewatigoing&quot;. It lost its importance when the Jesuit missionaries founded New L&#x27;Arbre Croche at what is now Harbor Springs in 1830.

Cross Village, like many of the area&#x27;s small towns, was once a thriving center for lumber. Because of its location on the lakeshore it was also a fishing community. Cross Village is one of the oldest settlements in Michigan and today is known for its ties to the Ottawa people.

Early records say that Father Jacques Marquette, the famous French Jesuit who endeared himself to the Native American population of northern Michigan, planted a huge white cross on the bluff overlooking Lake Michigan before his death in 1675. As late as 1787, as many as twenty tribes populated the region and met here around tribal council fires. To the Natives who populated the numerous historic missions in the area, Cross Village became known as the &quot;Land of the Cross&quot;. To the French, this region was known as &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Arbre Croche&quot;; to the Ottawas, it was called &quot;Wau-gaw-naw-ke-ze&quot;&quot;; and to the English-speaking people at the time, it was simply known as &quot;Land of the Crooked Tree&quot;.

Bishop Frederic Baraga is another individual with historical ties to Cross Village. Baraga left a comfortable, aristocratic existence behind when he left Slovenia. He arrived in Michigan in 1830 to serve the Native population and isolated small communities of this region. He spoke and developed written Native languages and is credited for spreading the Gospel among the local Ottawas and Ojibwe. In 1853, Baraga was elevated to Bishop in the Catholic Church, becoming the first bishop in Upper Michigan.

Father Francis Xavier Pierz, Bishop Baraga&#x27;s friend and fellow Slovenian, was also assigned to Cross Village for many years. Father Pierz, however, was bothered by the increasingly settled nature of the region and departed for the newly organized Minnesota Territory in 1852.

In 1855 Emmet County was reorganized and four new townships were created by the state. One of them was &quot;La Croix&quot;, which was officially changed its name to &quot;Cross Village&quot; in 1875.

Today, a replica of Father Marquette&#x27;s cross stands at the edge of the bluff and is visible from off shore, far into Lake Michigan. Every year a small garden at the base of the cross is lovingly tended by the town&#x27;s garden club.
The &quot;Tunnel of Trees&quot;, a breathtaking scenic drive down the winding Lake Michigan shoreline runs between Cross Village and Harbor Springs to the south. The drive is famed for its fall color scenery.

Cross Village is also home to Blissfest and the annual pow wow. Blissfest is a summer folk music festival that draws participants from across the nation. It takes place on the Festival Farm on Division Road.
Parts of the Cross Village area are protected nesting grounds for the endangered piping plover.

<text>Harbor Springs is a city and resort community in Emmet County, Michigan, United States. The population was 1,274 in the 2020 census.

Harbor Springs is in a sheltered bay on the north shore of the Little Traverse Bay on Lake Michigan. The Little Traverse Lighthouse is a historic lighthouse on the Harbor Point peninsula, which shelters the deepest natural harbor on the Great Lakes. M-119 connects with US 31 east and south at Bay View and Petoskey, which is away on the south side of the harbor.

The area is known for its historic summer resorts, such as Wequetonsing, which was founded by Illinois businessmen and lawyers Henry Stryker III, and Henry Brigham McClure. They were both connected with the Jacob Bunn industrial dynasty of Illinois.

==History ==

The European-American settlement started with a mission by French Catholic Jesuits; they called this area &quot;L&#x27;Arbre Croche,&quot; meaning Crooked Tree. In 1847, L&#x27;Arbre Croche had the largest concentration of Native Americans in Michigan. French traders renamed the area Petit Traverse, or Little Crossing, when they arrived in the area. After more settlers came from the eastern United States, they changed the name of the village to Harbor Springs, incorporating it in 1880.

The federally recognized Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians are descendants of the numerous Odawa bands that occupied this area. They have their tribal offices in Harbor Springs and a gaming resort in Petoskey.

Ephraim Shay (1839–1916) is known for his invention of the Shay locomotive. The hexagonal-shaped house he built in downtown Harbor Springs is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The local elementary school is named after him.

The Douglas House on the shore of Lake Michigan was designed by architect Richard Meier and completed in 1973. This house is one of 150 structures listed in 2007 as America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.

<doc id="117439" wikidata="Q2415663" url="?curid=117439" title="Petoskey, Michigan">
<text>Petoskey ( ) is the largest city and the county seat of Emmet County, Michigan, and is the largest settlement within the county. Petoskey has a population of 5,877 at the 2020 census, up from 5,670 at the 2010 census.

Petoskey is part of Northern Michigan, and is one of the northernmost cities in Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula. Petoskey is located on the southern shore of Little Traverse Bay, a bay of Lake Michigan. Petoskey sits directly across the bay from Harbor Springs, another Emmet County city. Petoskey is a popular Midwestern resort town.

Petoskey lends its name to the Petoskey stone, a fossilized coral that is the state stone of Michigan.

==History==
===Odawa inhabitants===
The Little Traverse Bay area was long inhabited by indigenous peoples, including the Odawa people. The name &quot;Petoskey&quot; is said to mean &quot;where the light shines through the clouds&quot; in the language of the Odawa. After the 1836 Treaty of Washington, Odawa Chief Ignatius Petosega (1787–1885) took the opportunity to purchase lands near the Bear River. Petosega&#x27;s father was Antoine Carre, a French Canadian fur trader and his mother was Odawa.

===Early Presbyterian missions===
By the 1850s, several religious groups had established missions near the Little Traverse Bay. A Mormon offshoot had been based at Beaver Island, the Jesuit missionaries had been based at L&#x27;arbor Croche and Michilimackinac, with a Catholic presence in Harbor Springs, then known as &quot;Little Traverse&quot;. Andrew Porter, a Presbyterian missionary, arrived at the village of Bear River (as it was then called) in 1852.

===Pioneer commercial interests===
Amos Fox and Hirem Obed Rose were pioneer entrepreneurs who had made money during both the California Gold Rush and at Northport selling lumber and goods to passing ships. Originally based at Northport, in the 1850s Rose and Fox (or Fox &amp; Rose) expanded their business interests to Charlevoix and Petoskey. Rose also earned income as part of a business partnership that extended the railroad from Walton Junction to Traverse City. H.O. Rose, along with Archibald Buttars, established a general merchandise business in Petoskey.

After the partnership split, Rose relocated to Petoskey and in 1873 built the first dock in the town. When the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad was about to be extended into the Bay View area, Rose purchased much land in that area, as well as trolley cars, to enable transport between Petoskey and Bay View. Rose also developed the first general store, extensive lime quarries (Michigan Limestone Company, aka Petoskey Lime Company;), building the Arlington Hotel, and lumbering enterprises, and harbor improvements in 1893. He served as first president of the village and officiated at early commemorative public events. Rose&#x27;s influence on the city was also commemorated by the naming of the H. O. Rose room at the Perry Hotel.

=== Passenger Pigeons ===
In the late 19th century, Petoskey was in the region of Northern Michigan where 50,000 passenger pigeon birds were killed daily in massive hunts, leading to their complete extinction in the early 20th century. A state historical marker memorializes these events, including the last great nesting of the passenger pigeons at Crooked Lake in 1878. One hunter was reputed to have personally killed &quot;a million birds&quot; and earned $60,000, the equivalent of $1 million today.

Petoskey is noted for a high concentration of ancient fossil coral, now named Petoskey stones, designated as the state stone of Michigan.

This city was the northern terminus of the Chicago and West Michigan Railway.

With members descended from the numerous bands in northern Michigan, the Little Traverse Bay Band is a federally recognized tribe that has its headquarters at nearby Harbor Springs, Michigan. It also owns and operates a gaming casino in Petoskey.

==Geography==

Part of Northern Michigan, Petoskey is on the southeast shore of the Little Traverse Bay of Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Bear River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The last Chesapeake and Ohio (successor to the Pere Marquette) trains were discontinued by 1963, thus ending scheduled passenger train service to Petoskey.

<text>Grootegast (; ; ) is a village and former municipality in the northeastern Netherlands. It is the sister city of Kingston, Tasmania. The municipality was merged into the municipality of Westerkwartier on 1 January 2019.

== Geography ==
The former municipality contained the population centres: Doezum, Enumatil, Faan, Grootegast, Kornhorn, Lutjegast, Niekerk, Oldekerk, Opende, Sebaldeburen. In some of these villages, they still speak the West Frisian language.

==History==
The village originated around the year 1000 (as &quot;Majorgast&quot;) and was profiled from 1400 onwards as the counterpart of Lutjegast. The village contains a 17th-century church, the so-called (&#x27;Little White Church&#x27;). This church was restored in 1829.

Grootegast was the main village of the former municipality. The name of the village refers to a or , a higher, sandy ridge in an otherwise swampy area. is Dutch for &#x27;large&#x27;.

==Dialect==
The &quot;Grootegasters&quot; dialect, or &quot;Westerkwartiers&quot;, is clearly a borderline case. Linguistically, the influences of three provinces are noticeable: the dialect is a variant of Gronings, but in terms of intelligibility it is more like Drents; however, the accent and grammar sound rather Frisian, which can be explained by the fact that almost all of Lutjegast still spoke Frisian 100 years ago. Being a border village of Lutjegast, Frisian influence is still noticeable today in the number of villagers of Frisian origin and the many business and social contacts with Friesland.

Atlas Township was organized in 1836 as part of Lapeer County, and was one of the earliest townships in this region to receive settlers. The first settler was Asa Farrar, who, in September, 1839, purchased land on section 18 and built a log house upon it the same year. He was a brother of Pearson Farrar, who settled the same year in Grand Blanc upon an adjacent section. They came from Monroe County, New York. The first birth and the first marriage in the township occurred in Asa Farrar&#x27;s family, respectively, in 1833 and 1834.

In 1831, Norman Davison settled on the banks of Kearsley Creek in section 8 starting the Davisonville settlement. Soon, the settlement was the center of the township&#x27;s development. The mills were built in 1833 (saw-mill) and 1836 (grist-mill).

Goodrich was started in September 1835 with Moses and Enos Goodrich purchasing over one thousand acres near the center of the township and building a log cabin before fetching their family. The township was detached from Lapeer County and added to Genesee County in 1843.

==Government==
===Beecher Fire Department===

The former Beecher Fire Department (now known as Mt. Morris Township Fire Station 3) is one of three stations in Mount Morris Township, Michigan. The station serves the Beecher area ( and population of 21,000) within the Township.

The department was founded in 1948 and operated independently of the other two stations until recently. 

===Beecher Metropolitan Water and Sewer District===

The Beecher Metropolitan Water and Sewer District is a special district for water and sewer serving generally the same area as the Beecher Community School District with 4,500 homes. A district board of five elected members oversees operation. The district&#x27;s source of water is underground wells.

The District was formed in 1938. Heavy rains in April 2009 led to the district reporting 5,000 gallons spilling into the Hughes Drain, which drains into the Flint River.

In August 2009, all members of the board were discovered to have taken a 19-day, $36,000 trip to San Diego, California, for a four-day American Water Works Association conference. After the nonrenewal of administrator Richard Wurtz&#x27;s contract, language was submitted to recall three of the five board members: Leo McClain, Sheila Thorn and Jackie Corlew. The Genesee County Election Commission approved the language that included the reasons of misusing District funds and &quot;for causing embarrassment to Beecher area residents&quot;.

==History==
Although there were Native Americans and trappers whom lived on land earlier, and even some who attempted to settle by there, many of the original settlers of Burton came from the towns of Adams and Henderson in Jefferson County, New York. 
For 20 years, this area was known as the &quot;Atherton settlement&quot;, after brothers Shubael and Perus Atherton and nephew Pliny Atherton Skinner (and later joined by another brother, Adonijah), who settled on the Thread Creek in 1835. Atherton descendants still live in Burton in 2014.

===Township===
The City of Burton was organized as Burton Township, in 1855. Burton Township had first been a part of Flint Township. The North part of Burton was part of Kearsley Township along with the Southern part of Genesee Township from 1839 until 1843 when the township was merged back (for school purposes) into Flint Township. When the City of Flint incorporated, Burton Township was separated from Flint Township by the Genesee County Board of Supervisors on October 12, 1855, although the first township meeting did not take place until April 7, 1856, which is sometimes taken as the actual date of organization. On December 13, 1861, a post office was opened with Horace L. Donelson as postmaster and only operated until August 6 of the next year.

Over the years, large portions of the northern and western sides of the township were annexed by the City of Flint for revenues.

===City===
On May 16, 1972, township residents voted to incorporate and the City of Burton was officially formed July 1 of that year. Burton began receiving Karegnondi Water Authority water treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division on December 15, 2017.

In the Northeast area of the township on November 2, 1855, the Valeria post office opened with Andrew N. Felt as postmaster. This PO closed on November 21, 1860.

In 2002, the township residents approved a 1-mill tax renewal which was used to start its police department in December ending a contract with Genesee County Sheriff Department. The department started with two full-time and four part-time officers. From 2004 to 2008, the 10 officer department issued over $516 thousand in tickets making it one of the top three in Genesee County not considering the City of Flint.

On November 3, 2009, a successful recall took place removing the township supervisor, Bruce Beatty, and two trustees, Glenn Huffman and Chuck Shinouskis.

Additional public safety millage request were placed on the ballot due to falling property value thus revenue from the original millage. In May 2011, a 2.2-mill public safety tax request for police and fire, was turned down at the ballot. Individual police and fire millage were on the ballot at February 2012 election with the 1.6 mills for police defeated and the 0.8 mills fire approved. The township made another attempt at a police millage with a 1.9 mill proposal on the November 3, 2015 ballot.

Clayton began receiving Karegnondi Water Authority water treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division on December 15, 2017.

While New Flint proponents indicated that would not be the case, Swartz Creek area residents campaigned against New Flint while moving to incorporate the area. The Township lost the Otterburn area to the City of Swartz Creek upon its incorporation in 1959.

<doc id="117460" wikidata="Q967748" url="?curid=117460" title="Flushing, Michigan">
<text>Flushing is a city in Genesee County, Michigan, United States. The population was 8,411 at the 2020 census. Flushing is considered a suburb of Flint. It is situated within the survey area of Flushing Charter Township, but is administratively autonomous.

Flushing originated as a mill town in the mid-1830s. Its location along the Flint River, the county&#x27;s largest river, was a decisive factor in its settlement. Water power potential was a significant determinant for the selection of the settlement areas throughout the nineteenth century. In addition to its water power, the area around Flushing was also well suited to agricultural pursuits.

The name Dover originally was selected for the new village until it was discovered that the name already was in use in Lenawee County. Charles Seymour Sr., former resident of Flushing, Long Island, subsequently named the new community after the village in New York State.

==History==
The earliest known inhabitants of Flushing were the Sauk Indians. Evidence suggesting that the second battle of Skull Island was fought in Flushing, including mass burial mounds, were found along the Flint river near the Bailey farm; now the present day Flushing Valley Golf Club. Mounds were observed in 1833 or 1834 and about 20 mounds in total.

In 1835, Charles Seymour Sr. from New York state came to the Flushing area after purchasing land there. He formed a partnership with Horace Jerome in 1836 who had purchased water rights in the vicinity. In their partnership, Seymour would provide pine timber while Jerome would build a mill. The saw mill was operational in the summer of 1837. Jerome left Flushing after his wildcat bank, the Flint Rapids Bank, failed in 1838. A village plat on sections 26 and 27, bearing the name of Flushing and named after the township in which it was located, was laid out December 3, 1840 by Charles Seymour Sr. In 1843 Charles sold out to his brother James Seymour. James then made an additional plat, 31, in 1847.

in 1850, a flat-bottomed boat established early transportation between Flint and Flushing.

On January 10, 1868, a Masonic Lodge, Flushing Lodge No. 223 F. &amp; A. M., was chartered by the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Michigan.

On July 30, 1873, village women formed the Flushing Ladies&#x27; Association.

In 1874, a subscription private fire department, the Wolverine Fire Company, was formed with 35 members and Arza N. Niles as first chief engineer. Wolverine paid for a small engine designed by Captain Haas of Flint of his own design and patent.

Flushing was incorporated as a village on March 21, 1877 with its first election held on May 8, 1877. Oscar F. Clarke was elected as the first village president. After incorporation, the fire company turned over its equipment to the village. In 1878, the Haas engine was instrument in containing a major fire in the business district to just a saloon and hotel.

The Flushing Patrol, the village&#x27;s first professional newspaper, was founded on October 18, 1878 by D. C. Ashmun. In 1880 the paper sold for $1.50 per year.

The paper would cost 1 dollar per year. The paper touts &quot;The Interests of Flushing and Vicinity Will Be Observed Herein&quot;. On June 15, 1882, DeWitt C. Ashmun sold his paper, The Flushing Patrol, to Albert E. Ransom who changed its name to &quot;The Flushing Observer&quot;.The Flushing Observer also published its first paper under that name on that same date

The railroad was first brought to Flushing in 1888. Headed by John Ashley, the Toledo and Ann Arbor Railroad connected Flushing to Durand and Saginaw. Construction reached Flushing in July 1888. On Monday, Dec. 17, 1888, the first passenger train arrived from Saginaw. The fare from Flushing to Saginaw was 80 cents. A railroad engine crossed the Flint river for the first time to Hart &amp; Clark mill on February 7, 1889. The line is currently owned by Huron and Eastern Railway, while the restored 1888 depot is now the Flushing Area Museum and Cultural Center.

March 25, 1895 vote passes 215 to 30 for $20,000 bond to build a water works system and electric light plant. Water mains are first installed for use on Nov 1, 1895. Electricity was installed and ready for use on Nov 15, 1895, along with streetlights on Main St. By January 1897 there were 1600 incandescent lamps in the village.

The Hart Flour Mill is destroyed in a fire on March 19, 1918. It was the 3rd Mill on the site and the 3rd to burn. The mill provided electricity until it burned down in 1918, leaving the village without power for 14 months until a new power plant was built.

Main Street was paved in 1920.

In May 1922 the current bridge on Main Street over the Flint river is completed. The bridge is a traditionally composed earth-filled closed spandrel concrete arch bridge built by L. Smith, H. A. and M. C. Nichols of Hastings, Michigan. The bridge was rehabilitated in 1998 adding new walkways and updated guardrails. The first wood bridge was built on this site in 1839. A second wood bridge in 1856. A third wood bridge in 1872 and a double span iron bridge in 1880. The iron bridge was removed in 1921.

Tucker Memorial Pool was dedicated on July 1, 1956. The pool was built with money donated to the City from the will of Max Dealton Tucker who was born in Flushing.

A book by Edmund G. Love titled &quot;The Situation in Flushing&quot; was published September 1, 1965. Edmund was born in Flushing and moved to Flint when he was 12. The book tells the account of his boyhood in the early 20th century.

Completed in 1975 by Michigan Bell Telephone at a cost of $2.2 million, the now AT&amp;T building sits on the site of the former home of James Seymour, brother of Charles Seymour. The home was built in the 1850s and torn down prior to Bell selecting the site.

On Monday November 27, 2017, the northern loop set of municipalities, including Flushing, began receiving water from the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline which is treated by the Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division.

On January 15, 2020, District 2 councilwoman Karianne Martus resigned due to her new job at the Flint Farmers Market. With no decision of the council to fill the vacancy, three more councilors resigned at the beginning of the Covid Pandemic citing &quot;discord&quot;. John Olson, long-time Planning Commission member, was appointed to serve as city councilman (temporary) in late March 2020 by Genesee County Election Commission. City Manager Brad Barrett was terminated April 20, 2020 at the city council meeting citing ethical concerns and Clarence Goodlein was immediately appointed interim City Manager. A special election was held on August 4, 2020 to fill the vacancies. Councilmen Dan Fralick, Eric Johnson, Dane Miller and councilwoman Danielle Smith were each elected to four year terms.

<text>Flushing Charter Township is a charter township of Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 10,701 at the 2020 census. Flushing Township was rated the 63rd safest community in America with a population over 10,000 by SafeWise, a home security and safety brand, in 2017.

==Communities==
* Brent Creek is a small community within the township at on Mt. Morris Road between Nichols Road and Seymour Road. Retiring after twenty years of U.S. diplomatic service in Spain and Portugal, Thomas Ludwell Lee Brent, a nephew of Virginia Congressman and Senator Richard Brent and grandson of Virginia colonial statesman Thomas Ludwell Lee, bought a large tract of land here and settled on it. In 1837, his workers built a mill on the Charlotte Creek, which was named for his daughter, but was later renamed Brent Creek. A post office named Brent Creek was established on November 2, 1888 with Frank J. Browne as the first postmaster. The spelling was changed to Brentcreek on June 25, 1894.

==History==

In the fall of 1835, Rufus Harrison was the first settler in the future Flushing Township. Flint Township was organized in 1836 and included the township areas of Burton, Clayton, Flushing, Mt. Morris, Genesee, Thetford, Vienna and Montrose. Genesee and Flushing Townships were split off on March 6, 1838. Flushing Township originally included survey townships of 7 &amp; 8 North in Range 5 East and the west half of 7 &amp; 8 North in Range 6 East. At a meeting at Ezekiel R. Ewing&#x27;s house, Dover was proposed by Ebenezer French as the township&#x27;s name. However, since another Dover Township already existed in the state, the Michigan legislature chose Flushing. With a loss of early records, only the identity of the first clerk, Abiel C. Bliss, is known. In October, 1838, the Township was divided into five school districts and appointed two school inspectors, Abiel C. Bliss and Jarvis Bailey.

Thomas L. L. Brent was a prominent early settler coming before 1836 and purchased up to of Michigan land. He built a saw mill and dam, which was destroyed by a freshet, in Section 3 on the Flint River. He thus found the Brent Creek community.

In the 1840, the &quot;English Settlement&quot; started to form in the Township&#x27;s northwest area with settlers from England. The Village of Flushing was platted that same year, 1840. Clayton Township (survey township 7N 5E) was split off in 1846. In 1855, the West half of survey township 8 North in Range 6 East was reunited with the East half to form Mt. Morris Township. The Flushing community was incorporated as a village on March 21, 1877.

On December 22, 1951, a B-29 Superfortress crashed onto the farm of Crerston E. Sammons, off Beecher Road. The bomber was on a routine navigational training flight from Minneapolis to its home base at Griffiss Field at Rome, New York when its engines failed. The dead pilot, 1st Lieutenant Robert Davis Phelps of Andover, New Hampshire, was found near the wreckage with his body wrapped within his parachute. Phelps is credited with steering the crippled aircraft away from residential areas and preventing further loss of life. The seven other crew members parachuted to safety.

On Monday November 27, 2017, the northern loop set of municipalities, including Flushing, began receiving water from the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline and treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division.

<text>Gaines Township is a civil township of Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 6,664 at the 2020 census.

==Communities==
*The Village of Gaines is located within the township.
*Duffield is an unincorporated community in the township that is located at the intersection of Duffield and Reid Roads, south of the railroad tracks at .

==Background==
The first settler, Hartford Cargill, moved into the township section 36 in 1836. Other early settlers settled in an area called Fletcher&#x27;s Corners. Philander McLain&#x27;s family settled in what is now the City of Swartz Creek. Ephraim Fletcher came to Gaines from New York in 1836 and settled on Van Vleet Road (section 16).

Mundy Township was organized in 1837 and included Gaines Township, which was organized in 1842. A school was started around 1845 by the Van Vleet and Cargill areas.

==History==
Gaines Township which was organized in 1842 from Mundy Township. Joshua Dart, the oldest male resident, was given the honor of naming the township. He then named it after General Gaines, an acquaintance who fought in the War of 1812.

On October 4, 1852, the Gaines Post Office was opened. With two Gaines Post Offices (Gaines and Gaines Station in 1856), this post office was renamed to Covert on January 2, 1863. On April 13, 1865, Covert was closed.

The Village of Gaines area did not see a settler until 1856. The first passenger train passed through the future village site on July 4, 1856. A post office was established that same year as the Gaines Station office. The Village of Gaines was incorporated in 1875.

At Duffield on June 13, 1884, a post office was opened, which operated until June 30, 1927.

===Crapo Farm===
Crapo Farm was built by Henry H. Crapo in 1860. The farm was at its peak 1,100 acres. The location was considered a hamlet and had a depot called Crapo. Henry M. Flagler was worker on the farm during its early years.

The original land was a 600-acre drained swamp called Deadman&#x27;s Swamp. Crapo had a four-mile ditch dug. The ditch was four-foot wide at the base and 10 feet at top. In 1860, Crapo was elected governor during the Civil War. Purchasing four, pure Herefords from Canada, Crapo began a herd of cattle.

Henry died in 1869 leaving his farm to his only son William W. Crapo. With the railroad coming through the farm in 1876, William negotiated for of the railroad ditches for drainage plus its own private side track. The side track was for visitors and produce including cattle. Thus, the farm was the only one with a private depot on the railroad timetables. William died in 1926 thus the farm passed to one of his sons, Stanford Tappan Crapo. Land was donated for a new school, Mary Crapo, which was finished in 1928. At Stanford&#x27;s death in 1939, William (Bill) Wallace Crapo II took over as the final owner of the farm.

In the early 1950s, depot usage was discontinued. Crapo Farm was sold in the 1955 after donating a part for St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery. A subdivision was built on part of the farm called Winchester Village followed by another, Winchester Woods. All of former and most of the latter were incorporated into the City of Swartz Creek at founding in 1959. Another part of the part was used for Oakwood Village subdivision development.

===Modern era===
In 1979, the Township decided to form its own fire department. On April 1, 1980, Gaines Township Fire Department was formed splitting the township off from Swartz Creek Area Fire Department, a joint department with Swartz Creek City and Clayton Township.

Berlin &amp; Farro Liquid Incineration Inc. had a license for a landfill and incinerator in the township, 3.5 miles south of Swartz Creek. After multiple violations in 1975, Berlin &amp; Farro lost their landfill and incinerator license but continue to dump waste there. Per EPA records, the company operated unauthorized and unlined waste storage lagoons, dumped liquid waste into agricultural drains and buried waste. Genesee Circuit Judge Judith A. Fullerton ordered a clean up in 1980 and an evacuation of the area. The evacuation, from two weeks to a month, took place in 1983 when the toxins became to much for the residents. The next year, doctors indicated that the site affected five residents with mild to severe damage to multiple organs. The clean up cost more than $25 million.

In 2000, the Township started its own one officer police department with the assistance of the Michigan State Police Department. In 2013, the police chief turned in a resignation letter March 1. On March 6, the board of trustees voted 3 to 2 to disband its police department with the State Police providing police protection by default. In November 2013, the township approved a .5 mil police millage by 1 vote. The township board then reestablished their police department with two officers. On April 2, 2014, the township turned down Mundy Township&#x27;s offer to provide police services to the township while absorbing the township&#x27;s police staff. Gaines Township Police Chief Mark Schmitzer then attended a Gaines Village Council meeting on April 9 to propose the village merge their department into the township as village residents are paying the township police millage.

In 2014, Supervisor Chuck Melki, Gaines Township Clerk Mike Dowler and Treasurer Diane Hyrman had recall petitions filed against them. In late September, Genesee County Clerk-Register John Gleason stripped the trio of their election duties, all three removed from the township election commission and Dowler from supervision of the election, appointing others in their place. As part of the first of its kind recall, the three faced off against other candidates to retain their offices. Dowler and Hyrman defeated their Republican opponent while Melki lost to Paul Fortino.

In August 2016, the village&#x27;s lone police officer retired thus police protection was being provided by the township. By March 9, 2017, the village council formally dissolved the police department and Gaines Township purchased the police car.

The township residents approved a mosquito control ballot proposal in November 2016 that would allow the township to assess up to $50 for mosquito control. In September 2017, Gaines Township and Metro Police Authority officers were cross sworn in each other jurisdictions as a form of mutual aid while not necessarily planning to merge with the Authority.

The township residents approved a fire department 1-mil millage proposal in November 2024 with 59.78% casting their ballots in favor of the measure. This new funding will be collected over a five-year period, from 2024 through 2028, and is specifically for the purchase of vehicles, apparatus, and equipment needed by the fire department, per the proposal. The millage is expected to generate an estimated $255,917 in its first year of collection, providing a significant boost to the township’s ability to equip its fire department.

The township earliest settlers, Luman Beach and Addison Stewart, came in 1833 in the area of Geneseeville. In September 1835, Sherman Stanley from Mount Morris, New York, started the Stanley settlement at the corners of sections 8, 9, 16, and 17 (now the intersection of Bray and Stanley Roads). In additional, several other families from that same city joined him there by 1838. A lumber mill was built with a dam in 1834 on the Kearsley Creek 1650 feet from the Flint River. This was followed by a second and third mills on Kearlsey in 1836 and 1837.

At Geneseeville, a forth mill was built on the Flint River in Geneseeville at the west side of section 11. Lot Clark and Stephen Warren, the mill builders, also got a charter granting them to build a dam for the mill. Later owners also build a companion grist mill in 1847.

This township area was transfer from Grand Blanc Township to newly created Flint Township on March 2, 1936. On July 19, 1837, Mount Morris had its post office open with Charles N. Beecher as its initial postmaster. 

On April 2, 1838, Genesee Township organizational meeting was held in Cold Water settlement. Genesee Township at organization included the eastern half of the future Mount Morris Township. With Mt. Morris completely with in Genesee Township on January 19, 1839, its post office was renamed Genesee. Kearsley Township was formed on April 19. 1839 with several sections of Genesee. The state legislature merged Kearsley Township back into Flint Township on March 7, 1843 with its northern half absorbed by Genesee at some point. In 1955, the western third was split off to form Mount Morris Township. Geneeseeville was platted by Ruben McCury and Simon King in 1858.

==History==
 John Goodrich traveled via steam ship from Buffalo to Detroit to settle after they had sold their home in the summer of 1835. They journeyed from Detroit towards modern-day Pontiac, where they met land explorers who told them of the land&#x27;s beauty. When they reached the vicinity of Davison&#x27;s Mill (now Atlas), they found rich, fertile soil, an excess of timber, and readily available water. They returned to Detroit and purchased one thousand acres (4 km) at $1.25 per acre. They returned to their old home in Clarence, New York and prepared to return to their purchased property. It was decided that John Goodrich would travel back via Canada. They completed their journey in 16 days, and built a cabin before the family arrived on May 20, 1836. The first wood-frame house was built for John Goodrich in 1838.

The first tavern, The Goodrich House, was built in 1866 by a Mr. Matthew Davidson. This was a popular spot for trading and salesman. In over one hundred years, there were several owners. The house fell victim to a fire in 2009 and was subsequently torn down.

<text>Grand Blanc is a city in Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan and a suburb of Flint. The population was 7,784 as of the 2020 US Census. It is part of the Flint metropolitan area.

==History==
The unincorporated village of Grand Blanc, or Grumlaw, was a former Indian campground first settled by Jacob Stevens in spring 1822. Several years later, settlers improved the Indian trail to Saginaw; they laid out and staked it in 1829 as Saginaw Road. Grand Blanc Township was formed in 1833 with area that would become the city. The township center began to boom in 1864 with the arrival of the railroad (now known as the CSX Saginaw Subdivision). With the post office there, the village was called Grand Blanc Centre by 1873, with the former Grand Blanc assuming the name Gibsonville (not Gibbonsville.)

By 1916, the community (population 400) had a grade school, a private bank, flour mill, an elevator, a creamery, and two churches, the Methodist Episcopal and the Congregational. The community was equipped with electrical lighting.

On January 1, 2024, the winning ticket for the first Powerball lottery of the new year was sold at Food Castle, a food and liquor store in Grand Blanc. The $842.4 million jackpot represented the fifth-largest in Powerball history and the tenth-largest jackpot ever in U.S. lottery history at the time of the drawing.

In the early morning hours of February 28th, 2024, an EF2 tornado touched down with winds reaching 115 mph, and a peak width of around 450 yards. The tornado started near Creasy Bicentennial Park damaging trees and outbuildings before reaching the Waretech Industrial Park at the intersection of Dort Highway and Reid Road. The warehouse was completely destroyed among other businesses and houses that received structural damage within the Indian Hill neighborhood region and Saginaw Road. 
The tornado lifted over Perry Road and had a total path length of 5.7 miles. This was the strongest tornado to ever strike Grand Blanc, and extremely rare given the nighttime strike as well as the February occurrence.

===City===
Grand Blanc Centre incorporated as the City of Grand Blanc in 1930. In 1939, the township and the city started a joint fire department. In the 1970s, the Grand Blanc city, township and school district formed a joint parks and recreation department under a commission with 2 members from each entity. In 1973, Grand Blanc-McFarlen Library, was built featuring approximately 45,000 books and offering a host of other materials. 
A ballot question in the May 2, 2006 Genesee County general election ended governmental research into a plan to consolidate the city and township governments; 68.62% of city voters opposed consolidation efforts whereas 31.38% were in favor.

On January 20, 2019, the Township Board voted to rescind its joint fire department agreement in 90 days unless a new agreement is reached. After eight decades of a shared fire department with Grand Blanc Township, the city decided to start up their own department starting July 25, 2019, and named a fire chief. Previously, the joint department was funded by each municipal levying a special levy of 0.5 mil for the department and designating 0.5 mil of general levy to the department.

After looking at the lack of management knowledge on the parks and recreation commission in the spring of 2019, the township and city decided to dissolve the commission. The decision was formalized in January 2020, with the township taking over the department to provide services to both municipalities. The city would go on to develop its own parks plan before starting its own department.

<text>Grand Blanc Township is a charter township of Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 39,846 at the 2020 census, a slight increase from 37,508 at the 2010 census. The city of Grand Blanc was formed out of part of the township&#x27;s survey area. The Charter Township is the largest suburb of Flint.

==Communities==
* Whigville, also known as Gibsonville, is an unincorporated community as designated by the posted signs in the Township along Hill Road, Dort Highway and Saginaw Street.

== History ==
Originally settled by Chippewa Indians, the township took its name—French for &quot;Great white&quot;—from French traders who arrived before 1800. Afterwards, pioneer families began settling in the township. Jacob Stevens settled at the survey township center and future city with his family in 1823. Stony Run post office was formed in the area when it was in Oakland County on June 6, 1934, with Marston W. Richards as the first postmaster.

The oldest unit of government in Genesee County, Grand Blanc Township was organized on March 9, 1833, by the Territory of Michigan. Then the township included the survey area of the future townships of Atlas, Burton, Davison, Fenton, Flint, Genesee, Mount Morris and Mundy. With the March 2, 1836 formation of Flint Township, Grand Blanc lost in addition the township survey areas of Burton, Genesee and Mount Morris to Flint. With the July 26, 1836 organization of Argentine Township, Grand Blanc lost Fenton to the new township. Mundy was split off on its March 11, 1837 organization. By March 1843, Atlas and Davison had been organized.

The township center began to boom in 1864 with the arrival of the railroad (now known as the CSX Saginaw Subdivision). On June 3, 1878, the Stony Run post office was closed then reopened on December 10, 1878, operating only to October 23, 1879.

Grand Blanc Centre incorporated as the City of Grand Blanc in 1930. In 1939, the township and the city started a joint fire department. In the 1970s, the Grand Blanc city, township and school district formed a joint parks and recreation department under a commission with 2 members from each entity.

An effort to consolidate the city and township into a single political entity was rejected by voters in both the city and township on May 2, 2006. In 2014, the superintendent left and the supervisor Micki Hoffman took over day-to-day management.

On January 20, 2019, the Township Board voted to rescind its joint fire department agreement in 90 days unless a new agreement is reached. the city decided to start up their own department starting July 25, 2019. Previously, the joint department was funded by each municipal levying a special levy of .5 mil for the department and designating .5 mill of general levy to the department.

After look at the lack of management knowledge on the parks and recreation commission in the spring of 2019, the township and city decided to dissolve the commission. In January 2020, the decision was formalized in January 2020 with the township taking over the department to provide services to both municipalities. The commission&#x27;s executive director resigned that month and a replacement also was hired and left the post of department director.

At the June 23, 2020 board meeting, the board voted 5 to 2 to terminate superintendent Dennis Liimatta. After failing to have a quorum at a special meeting on July 1 to address day-to-day operations given the vacancy, supervisor Scott Bennett has used his statutory authority to appointed a deputy supervisor, Police Chief Ron Wiles. Voters removed all five (5) of the board members that voted to terminate the former Superintendent Dennis Liimatta, and he was rehired by the newly elected Board on December 14, 2020, after settling a whistleblowers lawsuit brought by Liimatta against the previous board members.

<text>Linden is a city in southern Genesee County, Michigan, United States. Its population was 4,142 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Flint metropolitan area.

==History==
Linden was settled in late 1835 by two brothers, Richard and Perry Lamb. Perry Lamb provided housing for travelers. The village of Linden subdivision was platted by Consider Warner and Eben Harris in 1840. Warner and Harris also built the Springer&#x27;s Hotel hostelry that same year.

On September 23, 1851, the Linden post office was opened. North Linden village was platted in the northwest corner of section 20 along the railroad on January 31, 1857. Linden was incorporated as a village in 1871 by an act of the Legislature.

In 1974, the community began to hold its Summer Happening festival. In 1988, Linden changed its incorporated status from village to city.

In 2000, Linden, along with Fenton City and Township, passed a millage to turn the Tri-County Parks and Recreation share department into a parks and recreation metropolitan district, while Argentine Township and Tyrone Townships defeated the millage. Tri-County ceased operation on December 1, 2000 when the Southern Lakes Regional Parks and Recreation District began operations.

On May 18, 2007, a fire destroyed the historic Union Block of businesses and apartments on Broad Street. The building was demolished in August 2007 to make way for future development. In 2008, the LaFontaine family purchased the vacant space of seven lots. In 2014, an underground gasoline leak from the Beacon and Bridge gas station affected Union Block and other downtown properties. Dr. Nicole Wax of Wax Orthodontics of Linden purchased the block from the LaFontaine family in March 2016.

Summer Happenings was not held in 2011. A competing annual festival, Linden Mills Days, was launched in 2011 when Happenings pulled out of the city. In 2012, Happenings was held on Linden Community Schools grounds; while successful, it could not logistically return in 2013.

In September 2011, one of the Loose Senior Center buildings was destroyed by fire. A capital campaign began to replace the building. In June 2012, the center&#x27;s board of directors agreed to place a bid on a building in Fenton Township. Instead, the center added an expansion to an existing building which was finished in December 2013.

<text>The Charter Township of Montrose is a charter township of Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 6,224 at the 2010 census, a slight decrease from 6,336 at the 2000 census. The City of Montrose is surrounded by the township, but is politically and administratively autonomous.

Montrose Charter Township is located in the northwest corner of Genesee County, bisected nearly down the middle by the Flint River. It is a six-mile square Township with the City of Montrose occupying approximately one square mile in the middle of the Township. M-57 (Vienna Rd) splits the Township in half and is a major connector to I-75, which is located 2.5 miles east of the Township limits.

==History==

In 1847, the township was formed from neighboring Vienna Township and was known as Pewonigowink Township. This name was derived from the Pewonigowink Indian Reservation, of the Saginaw Chippewa, that extended into the northwest part of the Township. On January 15, 1848, the name was officially changed to Montrose Township, by an act of the Michigan Legislature.

The Township was originally studded with pine woodlands and during the first years of the white man&#x27;s occupancy, the inhabitants were chiefly engaged in various occupations related to a lumbering region. Montrose Township was the last settled district in Genesee County. Today, its landscape is mostly agricultural.

The Township incorporated as a Charter Township on March 26, 1985.[1]

The first white settlers in the township were the family members of Seymour Washington Ensign, a miller by trade, from Stafford, Genesee County, New York. Ensign came to Genesee County, Michigan in the spring of 1832, accompanied by his wife Tamma Fanny (Husted) Ensign and two sons, Seymour W. Jr., and George G. The family briefly halted in Grand Blanc, MI, where Ensign assisted local Alden Tupper in brick making. The family moved to Saginaw County in the fall of that same year, where they remained pioneers for a period of 10 years.

In the spring of 1842, Ensign visited what would become known as Montrose Township and purchased the southwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section 22 from Thomas L. L. Brent of nearby Flushing. During that year he and his family resided upon the Brent farm, in Flushing, while erecting a small frame house on their 40-acre purchase. In the spring of 1843 they became the first white residents in the township. Today, the approximate location of the Ensign homestead is the northeast corner of McKinley and Wilson roads.

The Ensign family was followed later that same year by settlers George Wilcox, from Canada and Richard Travis, from Oxford, Oakland County, MI. Both men settled relatively near by, with Mr. Wilcox on the east half of the southwest quarter of section 23 and Mr. Travis on the east half of the southeast quarter of section 23.

The assessment roll of shows that the only tax-paying residents in this township in 1844 were Ensign, Wilcox and Travis.

On Monday November 27, 2017, the northern loop set of municipalities, including Genesee, began receiving water from the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline and treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division.

<text>Mount Morris is a city in Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,086 at the 2010 census. The city is bordered by Mount Morris Township on the west and Genesee Township on the east. It was named after Mount Morris, New York, because many of the early settlers had come from there. It is part of the Flint metropolitan area.

== History==
Benjamin Pearson was the first settler in the area in 1833. In 1836, Frederick Walker was the first to settle within the future village site. A post office named Mount Morris was established on July 11, 1837, with Charles N. Beecher as the first postmaster. The name of the office was changed to Genesee on January 19, 1839, and back to Mount Morris on April 25, 1857. The name became Mount Morris Station on April 17, 1865, and finally reverted to Mount Morris on March 9, 1874. Development was spurred with the building of a line of the Pere Marquette Railway (now owned by Lake State Railway) in 1857. The settlement was first platted as Dover in 1862 and was incorporated as the village of Mount Morris in 1867. It reincorporated as a city in 1929.

On Monday, November 27, 2017, the northern Genesee County loop set of municipalities, including Mount Morris, began receiving water from the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division.

On December 9, 2015, the Regional Police Authority Board met for the first time with officers selected were City Councilman Curt Porath as chair and Township Trustee Kay Doerr as vice chair. A tour of a potential new HQ building for the authority was toured.

On January 9, 2016, the Swartz Creek City Council voted 6 to 1 to disband its police department by merging the department with Mundy Township&#x27;s into the Metro Police Authority of Genesee County effective February 1, 2016 following Mundy&#x27;s approval. In September 2017, Gaines Township and Authority officers were cross sworn in each other jurisdictions as a form of mutual aid while not necessarily planning to merge with the Authority. By November 23, 2017, the authority began working out of its new headquarters.

In May 2018, Interim Chief Lieutenant Matthew Bade was selected as permanent chief over former Swartz Creek Police Chief/Mundy Township Deputy Chief Rick Clolinger following the February retirement of Police Chief Dan Atkinson. On October 1, 2019, the city turned over the operation of the city’s parking violations bureau to the Metro Police Authority.

At the late November 2018 meeting, the authority board selected Simen, Figura &amp; Parker to prosecute all of the local ordinance violations for the authority. Mundy Township moved to be removed from this arrangement at the advice of its attorney, who did not bid to provide the service.

====Authority Board====
The authority board consists of seven members, three from each municipality plus one neutral member selected by the municipal members. The seventh member would vote in case of ties. Budget approvals need five votes. Current board members are Kay Doerr, Tonya Ketzler, Joe Oskey, David Krueger, Dennis Pinkston and Curt Porath

<doc id="117478" wikidata="Q2200776" url="?curid=117478" title="Swartz Creek, Michigan">
<text>Swartz Creek is a city in Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 5,897 at the 2020 census. The city is a suburb of Flint and has incorporated land formerly within Flint Charter Township, Gaines Township, and Clayton Township, but is administratively autonomous from all three.

==History==
Native Americans traveled the trail that paralleled the Swartz Creek to reach the maple trees, on what would later be the 
Crapo Farm, to fish, gather fruit, and hunt. This trail terminated in the Lansing area.

===Predecessor communities===

====Miller&#x27;s Settlement====

The Miller Settlement, and future core Swartz Creek community, was founded in June 1836 when it was first settled by Adam Miller, a German, and his family of eleven children in then Flint Township at its original size of 9 township survey areas. On March 11, 1837, just weeks after Michigan became a state, the southern area that would make up the community was placed into Mundy Township. Flushing Township was formed on March 6, 1838, split off from Flint Township, and included the northern part of the settlement. Two settlers were buried on the Miller property before that acre was deeded to Flushing township by Adam Miller.

In 1848, Miller Road was designed as a state road. in 1842, a post office was set up in the community called Swartz Creek after the stream. Soon, the community assumed that name. The Village of Swartz Creek subdivision was platted in 1877.

In 1881, Swartz Creek had a rail station called Hamilton. Serving the station was the Goodyear and Miller elevator and Western Union Telegraph. The locality also had a hotel run by William Brown, a Methodist church and a district school. The creek powered a saw mill and a flour mill at the time. Sommers &amp; Brewer business was a manufacturer of potash.

The first Masonic Temple in the community was built in 1906 on Miller Road. By the 1910s, the unincorporated village&#x27;s major industry was sugar beet farming with three beet weighing stations. An elevator and two churches were located there by 1916. A private bank, which was managed by Ira T. Sayre as part of a chain, was also open at that time.

In 1927, the community&#x27;s downtown roads were paved with gravel supplied by the Crapo Gravel Company, which created the now Winchester Lake. Electrical power was brought to the area that same year.

On Wednesday April 7, 1954 at about 7:40 PM, a small tornado hit the community. The tornado destroyed the fire hall, knocking down power lines and taking roofs off homes while only injuring two.

====Otterburn====
Otterburn as the rest of Flint Township was in Grand Blanc Township at its organized on March 9, 1833, then split off into Flint Township on March 2, 1836, then with the west half of the survey area was place in Flushing Township. The first land purchase in section 31, the general area of Otterburn, was on May 30, 1836, by John W. McNair.

Otterburn was in Flint Township, had about 150 residents and had its own train depot that opened in 1882. The location was known as Otterburn as otters were generally seen there on the Swartz Creek, a . On August 27, 1887, Charles F. Shumway assumed the position of postmaster for the post office upon its opening. The post office closed on October 31, 1913. In 1957, a Chevrolet plant, which was also referred to as Otterburn, was built in this area for its service and parts operations moved from the west Flint Chevy in the Hole complex.

====Winchester developments====

Crapo Farm was sold in 1955 after parts were donated for St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery and Mary Crapo School. The Winchester Village subdivision was built on the former farm. Which was followed by another, Winchester Woods. All of the village and most of the woods were incorporated into the City of Swartz Creek in 1959 at its founding.

===City===
In the 1950s, GM executive started a &quot;New Flint&quot; regional/metropolitan government plan to incorporate the metropolitan area into Flint. The proposal was released in 1957 and petition began circulating the next year. Area residents were fearful that New Flint would bring the Otterburn plant into its borders. While New Flint proponents indicated this would not be the case, area residents campaigned against New Flint while moving to incorporate the area. The city was incorporated on December 1, 1959. The city included parts of Gaines (Winchester Village), Clayton and Flint Townships (Otterburn).

In 1986, Sports Creek Raceway opened. The raceway was a harness racing track. The city received about $425,000 a year from wager dollars until 1993 when John Engler became Michigan governor. Engler reduced cash flow from the casinos for two years until a new distribution formula allowed the state to contribute less: from $126,000 to $118,000 by the mid-2000s.

In the 2000s, Gaines and Mundy Townships ceased contributions to cover building costs for the Swartz Creek Perkins Library, while Clayton Township ceased funding in 2011. In April 2011, the Flint Flames, a semi-professional Women&#x27;s Blue Chip Basketball League team, changed ownership and its name to Flint Monarchs. The Monarchs then moved its games to the Cage Field House in Swartz Creek from its previous location at Flint Northern High School. In 2014, the Monarchs moved their games back to Flint.

In 2004, the city formed a downtown development authority. In 2006, Meijer announced plans to build a location in Swartz Creek. Construction started in September 2012, and on May 16, 2013, the store opened on Morrish Road north of I-69.

In December 2013, the city council voted 4 to 3 to adopt a 4.9-mil public safety special assessment district consisting of the whole city. While a referendum petition could take the assessment to the ballot, some city residents threatened to recall members of city council who supported the millage. In January and February 2014, the city and Gaines Township were contacted by Mundy Township Supervisor David L. Guigear with the intent of regionalizing their building departments, code enforcement activities, janitorial services and police departments.

Also in December 2013, City Manager Paul Bueche, who was preparing for medical and disability leave, recommended the promotion of Adam Zettel, the current city zoning administrator and DDA Director, as interim City Manager. Zettel was also assistant city manager for the city of Owosso and former assistant city manager for the city from 2006 to 2010. The city council accepted Bueche&#x27;s recommendation and hired Zettel effective January 1, 2014. Bueche died on May 15, 2014.

Sport Creek Raceway was closed by the Michigan Gaming Control Board on January 1, 2015, as the raceway could not agree to terms with the Michigan Harness Horsemen&#x27;s Association. As of 2023, despite being under new ownership, there continue to be no plans to reopen the track.

A 5.7-mil property-tax levy for streets was placed on the May 5, 2015 ballot. The city proposal failed 729 to 831. On May 3, 2016, a smaller, 4.22-mil property-tax levy for street improvements was finally approved by city residents.

Fourth-precinct council member Michael Shumaker died on March 2, 2016, with his appointed temporary replacement being Jim Florence. A council member considered the city charter to have conflicting provisions thus bring into question an interim election in November. After 34 years of council service, Richard B. Abrams, last serving as mayor pro tem and prior mayor, did not seek reelection in November 2016.

On January 9, 2016, the Swartz Creek City Council voted to disband its police department by merging the department with Mundy Township&#x27;s into the Metro Police Authority of Genesee County effective February 1, 2017. On October 1, 2019, the city turned over the operation of the city&#x27;s parking violations bureau to the Metro Police Authority. Swartz Creek began receiving Karegnondi Water Authority water treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division on December 15, 2017.

By January 2022, Swartz Creek Community Schools completed a series of renovations on both schools within the city limits, in addition to the satellite elementary schools. A new, updated football field was completed in 2019, four years after the completion of the Swartz Creek Performing Arts Center. A new STEM wing was constructed at the high school, while the middle school continues to undergo construction to allow for STEM classrooms and performing arts facilities.

<doc id="117479" wikidata="Q7783575" url="?curid=117479" title="Thetford Township, Michigan">
<text>Thetford Township, is a civil township of Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 6,640 at the 2020 census, a significant decrease from 7,049 at the 2010 census.

==Communities==
* Thetford Center is an unincorporated community in the township at Center and Vienna Roads.
*Whitesburg, or &quot;Whitesburgh&quot;, is an unincorporated community in the township on Vassar Road, north of Scott Road and south of Dodge Road. It formerly had a post office and a railroad station.

==History==

On January 15, 1836, Pine Run Post Office was opened and renamed to Thetford on December 26, 1844. East Thetford Post Office opened on Dec 15, 1855 on Vienna Road west of Belsay Road.

On August 2, 1861, East Thetford Post Office was rename Thetford Center. Whitesburgh Post Office was opened on March 14, 1866. While on April 12, 1867, the Thetford Post Office was closed.

On March 28, 1873, the Whitesburgh Post Office was moved to and renamed Rogersville in Richfield Township. By 1873, the settlement of Henpeck came into existence at the four corners of sections 12, 14, 23 and 24, the intersections of Belsay and Vienna Roads. For township school district 8, the school was then located here. Thetford Center Post Office returned to its previous name, East Thetford, on June 9, 1873. The Rogersville office returned on November 16, 1895 to Whitesburg only to return to Rogersville on June 12, 1897. On July 12, 1898, the Thetford location was reestablished.

Both Thetford post offices were closed on August 30, 1902. Rogersville was discontinued on August 30, 1919.

===Modern era===
In 2001, the township began a police department by funding it from the general fund budget. The township board hired a part-time police Chief Thomas Kulcher at the time. Kulcher went on medical leave then resigned in 2007. A temporary police administrator was hired in Vienna Township Supervisor Anthony McKerchie, who then hired two part-time officers. A 1 mill levy to increase department staff was placed on the November 2007 ballot only to increase anti-police department sentiment and the levy failed at the ballot. In December 2008, McKerchie resigned. At a March 2008 board meeting, some residents called on the trustees to close the police department given the township was facing a $100-thousand deficit for the budget that was up for approval and greater presence of sheriff&#x27;s deputies and State Police troopers.

On Monday November 27, 2017, the northern loop set of municipalities, including Thetford, began receiving water from the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline and treated by Genesee County Drain Commission Water and Waste Division.

In 2008, the township police department started participating in the Defense Logistics Agency&#x27;s Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) surplus equipment program. By 2015, the department had received through the program 450 valued at more than $1.1 million. Township Trustee Stan Piechnik and Thetford Township Supervisor Gary Stevens requested an inventory and storage location. This was also augmented by an audit that indicated that this equipment should be accounted for in an inventory. Per Piechnik and Stevens Police Chief Robert Kenny had not aided in this effort such that the duo started looking for the equipment themselves as Piechnik claims that the surplus equipment were being delivery to friends of Kenny. After assuming they had permission in May 2017 to be on private property to look for the equipment, the duo were given a citation by Kenny for trespassing. Kenny also handled the investigation, but the charges where dismissed by the township attorney. LESO contacted the township to indicate an investigation was ongoing into the township&#x27;s participation. Stevens then requested the Genesee County Sheriff to investigate. By December 24, 2017, a group of residents included Eugene Lehr, who was storing 20 LESO items on his property, had filed language for recall petitions for Piechnik and Stevens with language clarity hearing set for December 27. The weekend after a township board on April 16, 2018 that had an heated exchange between Lehr and Stevens, equipment began showing up at the township offices. On April 26, 2018, the Sheriff&#x27;s Office conducted a warranted search of the police department. On May 7, 2018, an employee and father of the township clerk quit causing a dispute such that the township offices were close soon after opening. In June 2018, an envelope with $4,700 was found with the LESO equipment being moved, so the conduct of the chief was placed on its late June meeting. With Kenny unable to attend, a special meeting was called for July 2, 2018. With only three board members attending, the special meeting was canceled. One of the special meeting attendees then confronted and threatened Stevens the next day at the township offices. July 10 was the deadline for the recall petitions with no word if any were turned in the county clerk-register office. Steven planned to call another special meeting the week of July 16, 2018. While no additional special meeting was called, the board voted at the late July meeting to place a proposal on the ballot whether or not the township resident want their own police department. With the need to hold hearings and approve the ballot language, the township attorney advised them they did not have enough time and discontinue the effort. Kenny was then arrested on August 22 on two five year charges, embezzlement and obstruction of justice, and arranged the next day. A special meeting was called for August 24 to decide if to place him on leave.
