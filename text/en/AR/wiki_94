The primary community in the township is the census-designated place of Pompton Plains.

The name &quot;Pequannock&quot;, as used in the name of the township and of the Pequannock River, is thought to have been derived from the Lenni Lenape Native American word &quot;Paquettahhnuake&quot;, meaning &quot;cleared land ready or being readied for cultivation&quot;.

==History==
The name for the area goes back at least as far as March 1, 1720, when it was referred to as &quot;Poquanick&quot;, a precinct in Hunterdon County. Formed as &quot;Poquanock Township&quot; on March 25, 1740, as the county&#x27;s largest township, what is now a bedroom community with Pompton Plains in its northern portion and old Pequannock in its southern was once a vast region of rural farmland settled by the Dutch after its purchase by Arent Schuyler and associates in 1695 and 1696. The township was incorporated by the New Jersey Legislature&#x27;s Township Act of 1798 as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships on February 21, 1798.

Over time, several municipalities were split off from the township: Jefferson Township on February 11, 1804; Rockaway Township on April 8, 1844; Boonton Township on April 11, 1867; Montville Township on April 11, 1867; Butler Borough on March 13, 1901; Kinnelon Borough on March 21, 1922; Lincoln Park Borough on April 25, 1922; and Riverdale Borough on April 17, 1923.

During the American Revolutionary War, both Comte de Rochambeau and George Washington&#x27;s troops camped on what is now the site of the Pequannock Valley Middle School. While Washington stayed at the Schuyler-Colfax House in nearby Pompton, unproven oral history states that he attended church services in the First Reformed Church located in Pompton Plains, also known as the Pompton Meeting House, which had been constructed in 1771. The Mandeville Inn, located on the site of where the soldiers had camped during the war, was built in 1788 and was once owned by Garret Hobart, later Vice President of the United States. The stone with the engraved date is now located inside the Pequannock Valley Middle School when the Inn was demolished and replaced with the school in 1950.

During the Civil War, Pequannock was a stop on the Underground Railroad. The Giles Mandeville House (also built in 1788), a field and quarry-stone structure located at 515 Newark-Pompton Turnpike, which is believed to have served as a waypoint for many runaway slaves, still stands today, and has been in use as the Manse of the adjacent First Reformed Church since 1953.

According to the 2020 Census, Randolph was the 3rd most-populous municipality in Morris County and its land area was the eighth-largest in the county. The New Jersey State Planning Commission designates Randolph as half rural, half suburban. The community maintains a diverse population of nearly 26,000 residents.

In 2013, in the Coldwell Banker edition of “Best Places to Live in New Jersey for Booming Suburbs,” Randolph was the number one ranked town in Morris County and fourth overall in the state citing &quot;job growth, high percentage of home ownership, good schools, access to local shopping and community safety.&quot; Niche.com ranked Randolph amongst the Top 50 in its 2019 rankings of the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; in New Jersey.

== History ==

The earliest known inhabitants of what is now Randolph were the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. The earliest European settlers of what is now Randolph were Quakers and one of the pioneering landowners was Hartshorne Fitz-Randolph, who purchased of what would become the township in the Mine Hill area in 1753, later becoming the namesake of the township. New Jersey&#x27;s first iron mine was established in Randolph in 1713, and for hundreds of years the mines fostered the development of the township, providing the raw materials for weapons used by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. During the war, the area was a supply point for George Washington&#x27;s army during their winter encampment in nearby Jockey Hollow.

Randolph was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on January 1, 1806, from portions of Mendham Township. Portions of the township were taken on April 1, 1869, to create Dover Town within the township, which became an independent municipality as of March 5, 1896. Other portions of the township were taken to create Port Oram (June 26, 1895, now Wharton), Mine Hill Township (March 2, 1923) and Victory Gardens (June 20, 1951). The creation of Victory Gardens created a small triangular exclave of the township, surrounded by Victory Gardens to the southeast and Dover to the northwest.

Randolph became a vacation haven in the early part of the 20th century, known for its woods, ponds, lakes and air. Through the 1950s, farms, large hotels and bungalow colonies dotted the community. Performers such as Phil Silvers, and Frank Sinatra appeared at the hotels. Boxers Max Baer, Floyd Patterson, James J. Braddock and Rocky Marciano trained or fought at the Saltz Hotel.

The Township Council is the legislative body of Randolph, operating under the Council-Manager form of government within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law. The township is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The Township Council is comprised of seven members, who are elected at-large in partisan elections to four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either three or four seats up for election in even-numbered years as part of the November general election. The council selects one of its members to serve as mayor and another as deputy mayor, at a reorganization meeting conducted each year. The council represents the public and develops and adopts policies, resolves public issues, formulates township policy through motions, resolutions and ordinances which reflect the needs of the public, and maintains a working knowledge of intergovernmental issues and how they will affect the Township of Randolph.

<text>Rockaway Township is a township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 25,341, an increase of 1,185 (+4.9%) from the 2010 census count of 24,156, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,226 (+5.3%) from the 22,930 counted in the 2000 census.

Rockaway Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1844, from portions of Hanover Township and Pequannock Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Rockaway Borough (June 19, 1894), Port Oram (June 26, 1895, now Wharton) and Denville Township (April 14, 1913). Portions of the township were annexed to Boonton Township in 1906 and to Rockaway Borough in 1908.

The township shares its name with the Rockaway River and the neighboring borough. The name is derived from a Native American term, variously said to mean &quot;place of sands&quot;, &quot;creek between two hills&quot; or &quot;bushy&quot; / &quot;difficult to cross&quot;.

A large part of the township consists of Picatinny Arsenal, a United States Army base that covers nearly of the township (a portion of the facility is located in Jefferson Township), used mainly for the development of new weapons technologies, especially concerning anti-terrorism.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 45.89 square miles (118.85 km2), including 41.73 square miles (108.09 km2) of land and 4.16 square miles (10.77 km2) of water (9.06%).

Rockaway Township and its sister community, Rockaway Borough, and the area around the two municipalities are home to some scenic areas. These areas include lakes, rivers, and expansive ranges of mountains, covered with trees and wildlife and hiking trails, including Farny State Park, Wildcat Ridge WMA, Mount Hope Historical Park and Splitrock Reservoir.

Portions of the township are owned by the City of Newark, Essex County, for their Pequannock River Watershed, which provides water to the city from an area of that also includes portions of Hardyston Township, Jefferson Township, Kinnelon, Vernon Township and West Milford. Newark&#x27;s Pequannock Watershed is administered by the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corporation. The river keeper for the Pequannock River is the Pequannock River Coalition.

Two sites on the National Register of Historic Places are in Rockaway Township. Split Rock Furnace is a Civil War era iron ore furnace which is still intact. The Ford-Faesch Manor House, is a 1768 stone mansion that figured prominently during the Revolutionary War and in the 250-year history of Morris County iron industry.

Lake Telemark (with a 2010 Census population of 1,255) and White Meadow Lake (with 8,836 as of 2010
) are unincorporated communities and census-designated places (CDPs) located within Rockaway Township.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Beach Glen, Deer Pond, Denmark, Bowlbyville, Durham Pond, Foxs Pond, Green Pond (a lake and an accompanying residential community, though it uses a Newfoundland address in West Milford), Hibernia (site of the Hibernia mines), Hickory Hill, Hilltown, Lyonsville, Marcella, Meriden, Middle Forge, Middletown, Mount Hope, Picatinny, Spicertown and Split Rock.

Splitrock Reservoir is of wilderness in Rockaway Township that straddles the township&#x27;s border with Kinnelon. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection spent $3 million in 2015 to acquire a buffer area around the reservoir, as part of an agreement under which Jersey City retains rights to use water from the reservoir and is responsible for maintenance of the dam at the site.

Rockaway Township borders the municipalities of Boonton Township, Denville Township, Dover, Jefferson Township, Kinnelon, Randolph, Rockaway and Wharton in Morris County; and West Milford in Passaic County.

Despite being the largest municipality in area within Morris County, Rockaway Township does not have a specific zip code. The township is served by eight zip codes, seven from the surrounding towns and one of an unincorporated area within Rockaway Township. The zip codes for Rockaway Township are 07005 (Boonton), 07405 (Butler), 07435 (Newfoundland), 07438 (Oak Ridge), 07801 (Dover), 07842 (Hibernia), 07866 (Rockaway Borough), and 07885 (Wharton).

== Government ==

=== Local government ===
Rockaway Township is governed within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government (Plan F), implemented based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission as of January 1, 1968. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the township council. The mayor is directly elected by the voters. The township council is comprised of nine members, with one member elected from each of six wards and three elected on an at-large basis. The members of the governing body are elected to staggered four-year terms of office on a partisan basis in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election, with the six ward seats up for vote together and then the three at-large and the mayoral seat up for vote together two years later.

, the Mayor of Rockaway Township is Republican Joseph Jackson, who was elected to serve the balance of a term of office expiring December 31, 2023. Members of the Township Council are Council President Howard Kritz (R, 2023; At-large), Council Vice President John J. Quinn Jr. (R, 2025; Ward 2), Douglas Brookes (R, 2025; Ward 3), Rachel Brookes (R, 2025; Ward 6), Emanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Friedlander (D, 2025; Ward 5), Mary Noon (R, 2025; Ward 1), Jonathan Sackett (D, 2025; Ward 4), Adam Salberg (R, 2023; At-large) and Pawel Wojtowicz (R, 2023; At-large - elected to serve an unexpired term).

In January 2022, Joseph Jackson was selected as mayor following the resignation of Michael Puzio from the term expiring in December 2023. In March 2022, Pawel Wojtowicz was appointed to fill Jackson&#x27;s vacated at-large council seat, also expiring in December 2023. Jackson and Wojtowicz served on an interim basis until the November 2022 general election when voters elected them to serve the balance of the term of office for both seats.

In July 2019, Republican Mary Noon was appointed to fill the Ward 1 seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held by Victor Palumbo until he resigned from office the previous month in the face of a pending recall effort. In September 2019, the township council appointed Douglas Brookes to fill the Ward 3 seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held by Phyllis I. Smith until she resigned from office earlier that month; at the same meeting, the council removed Jeremy Jedynak from office due to excessive absence, after he had missed attending a string of meetings over a two-month period.

Jedynak was designated as acting mayor after the death of Mayor Michael Dachisen of a cardiac arrest in August 2018, pending the selection of an interim successor. At the appointment deadline in September 2018, Paul Minenna, a former councilmember, was selected to serve as mayor on an interim basis; the meeting had been pushed off and rescheduled for 10:30 PM after the site that had been originally designated for the special meeting was no longer available. In October 2018, a Superior Court judge ruled that all of the actions taken at the late-night meeting in September at which Minenna had been appointed were null and void as they violated the terms of the state&#x27;s Open Public Meetings Act; Adam Salberg was designated by the judge to fill the mayoral vacancy on an interim basis until the November 2018 general election, when voters will select a candidate to serve the balance of Dachisen&#x27;s term of office.

Michael Dachisen was selected to serve as mayor in June 2012 after Louis S. Sceusi stepped down to take a position as judge in New Jersey Superior Court, and was sworn in as mayor in July 2012. In November 2012, Dachisen won a special election to serve the balance of Sceusi&#x27;s term through 2015. Jeremy Jedynak took office in June 2013, filling the at-large seat held by John DiMaria, who left office to relocate outside of the state. The term expires in 2015 and the remaining two years of the seat were up for vote in the November 2013 general election.

<text>Victory Gardens is a borough in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,582, an increase of 62 (+4.1%) from the 2010 census count of 1,520, which in turn reflected a decline of 26 (−1.7%) from the 1,546 counted in the 2000 census.

Victory Gardens is Morris County&#x27;s smallest municipality, measured both by size and population, and its most densely populated. Additionally, the borough is the state&#x27;s fourth-smallest municipality by area.

==History==

The origins of the borough began in 1941, when the federal government acquired in Randolph Township as the site of a 300-unit housing project for war industry employees. The borough&#x27;s name is derived from the victory gardens planted at homes and parks during World War II to provide additional supplies of fruits and vegetables. Streets are named for U.S. Presidents.

Randolph Township residents approved a referendum as part of a September 1951 special election in which voters were asked if the township&#x27;s Victory Gardens neighborhood should be removed from the township and created as an independent municipality for its 1,300 residents covering . Residents of other areas of Randolph Township argued that the compensation paid by the federal government for the more than 250 students attending the Randolph Township Schools did not adequately cover the cost of their public education, that the housing and other structures in Victory Gardens was out of compliance with the township&#x27;s building and zoning ordinances and that the overwhelming Democratic Party political leanings of residents of Victory Gardens were out of sync with the largely Republican Party township.

Victory Gardens was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on June 20, 1951, from portions of Randolph Township, based on the results of the referendum passed on September 18, 1951.

The small town made news on November 16, 1958, when 262 members of its 297 families participated voluntarily as &quot;refugees&quot; in a civil defense exercise, while other residents of the town — &quot;school boys with Geiger counters, staff men with fancy helmets, girls with typewriters, Explorer Scouts, police and fire crews, medical teams and the dozens who just washed pots and pans and ladled stew&quot; — volunteered to assist. &quot;Those who remained home,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;were restricted in their movements by guards who patrolled the town.&quot;

A project approved in 1973 brought the construction of 184 units of garden apartments on a site covering , providing additional rateables and offering permanent housing for an estimated 400 people, that would contrast with the temporary original structures built in the 1940s that had long passed their expected lifespan.

<text>Washington Township is a township in southwestern Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 18,197, a decrease of 336 (−1.8%) from the 2010 census count of 18,533, which in turn reflected an increase of 941 (+5.3%) from the 17,592 counted in the 2000 census.

The township is situated in the westernmost part of Morris County bordering both Hunterdon and Warren counties. It is located within the Raritan Valley region and is one of six municipalities (five of which are townships) in the state with the name &quot;Washington&quot;. Washington Borough, located only away, is surrounded by another municipality that is also called Washington Township in Warren County.

The township has been ranked as one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2014–2018, Washington Township residents had a median household income of $150,682, nearly 90% above the statewide median of $79,363. In the 2013–2017 ACS, Washington Township had a median household income of $140,445, ranking 45th in the state.

== History ==
Washington Township was incorporated as a township by the New Jersey Legislature on April 2, 1798, from portions of Roxbury Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Chester Township as of April 1, 1799. The township was named for George Washington, one of more than ten communities statewide named for the first president.

In 1798, Morris County&#x27;s Washington Township became the first incorporated in New Jersey, but by 1894 there were 18 municipalities and other communities across the state named Washington or Washingtonville.

In June 1979, a 5-year-old boy was killed by a leopard that had been chained to a stake outside of a circus, during a performance sponsored by the local fire department at Flocktown Road School.

A 1983 effort to rename Washington Township to Long Valley failed in an election.

===Murder of Rachel Domas===
On September 12, 1985, 14-year-old Rachel Domas was sexually assaulted and murdered on Fairmount Avenue by 19-year-old Michael Manfredonia while on her three-mile walk from school to her home after missing the school bus. Manfredonia, a gas station attendant who worked nearby, confessed to asking Domas out, when he was refused he pulled a knife and threatened to kill himself. 

Domas told him to &quot;stop acting childish&quot; to which Manfredonia pushed her to the ground, sexually assaulted her and stabbed her 26 times, 15 of which were too shallow to cause significant damage and were intended to make Domas suffer. Police would find Domas&#x27;s body buried in a shallow grave in the woods close to the road 2 days later. 

Manfredonia would be turned in by his parents and was found by the police attempting to commit suicide by slicing his wrists and ingesting a high concentration of pills. Manfredonia, who had an IQ of 78 making him clinically retarded, was suffering from Intermittent explosive disorder. Manfredonia waved his right to a trial and was found guilty of murder, felony murder, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Manfredonia would be sentenced to life in prison as well as an additional 110 years and will not be eligible for parole until 2041.

<doc id="125586" wikidata="Q1088847" url="?curid=125586" title="Wharton, New Jersey">
<text>Wharton is a borough in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,241, an increase of 719 (+11.0%) from the 2010 census count of 6,522, which in turn reflected an increase of 224 (+3.6%) from the 6,298 counted in the 2000 census.

Wharton was originally incorporated as the borough Port Oram by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on June 26, 1895, created from portions of Randolph Township and Rockaway Township, subject to the results of a referendum passed on the previous day; the name was changed to Wharton on April 16, 1902, based on a referendum held that day and subject to legislation passed on March 27, 1902. The borough was named for Joseph Wharton of the Wharton Steel Company.

==History==
In 1831, the Morris Canal was completed from Newark to Phillipsburg, New Jersey across the Delaware River from the terminus of the Lehigh Canal. On the way, it passed through Boonton, Dover and Port Oram. On this route it tapped the Morris County ore fields and became a carrier for both ore and pig iron. Its main purpose, however, was as an extension of the Lehigh Canal to furnish a route for anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania mines to seaboard. Any local traffic was a gain to supplement the through anthracite freight and iron ore and its products soon became important sources of revenue. Sites on the canal were selected for docks and industry, including iron works.

On June 28, 1895, voters from the settlements Port Oram, Irondale, Luxemburg, Maryville and Mount Pleasant voted 143 to 51 to incorporate as the borough Port Oram, the largest of the communities in the area covering west of Dover, New Jersey. A mayor, six councilmen, an assessor and a collector were elected to govern the new borough which had started life as an ore shipping port on the Morris Canal. These elected officials (mine superintendents, store owners, a railroad superintendent and a school teacher) represented the leaders of these settlements where iron ore was mined, smelted and shipped.

The borough was renamed in 1902 in honor of Joseph Wharton, who was born in 1826 in Philadelphia to an old family of Quakers. Wharton first studied at a local Quaker school after which he worked on a farm rather than attend college because his parents wanted him to mature, and during the winter studied chemistry at the laboratory of Martin Hans Boyè in Philadelphia. He started producing zinc and nickel, and gradually bought a controlling interest in Bethlehem Iron Works. As his business interests expanded he purchased substantial shares of several railroads involved in the coal and iron trade, also purchasing iron mines and furnaces near Port Oram. After selling his interest in Bethlehem Iron Works in 1901 and his nickel works to CVRD Inco in 1902, he continued to actively acquire and manage a large and diverse business empire that included iron smelting in Wharton until just before his death in January, 1909. Wharton also endowed the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The town was named after him in a referendum in 1902.

In 1984, the long-time local bar The Heslin House and Hartley&#x27;s Store were destroyed in a gas leak explosion, in which flames as high as destroyed several area buildings.

Wharton was one of the filming locations for Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s music video &quot;Time After Time&quot; in 1984.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.13 square miles (5.51 km2), including 2.07 square miles (5.37 km2) of land and 0.06 square miles (0.14 km2) of water (2.63%).

The borough borders the Morris County municipalities of Dover, Jefferson Township, Mine Hill Township, Rockaway Township, Roxbury Township.

Unincorporated communities in the borough include Irondale, Luxemburg, Maryville, Mount Pleasant and Port Oram.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Wharton has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==

<text>Sister Carrie is a 1900 novel by Theodore Dreiser (1871–1945) about a young woman who moves to the big city where she starts realizing her own American Dream. She first becomes a mistress to men that she perceives as superior, but later becomes a famous actress. It has been called the &quot;greatest of all American urban novels&quot;.

==Plot==
In late 1889, dissatisfied with life in Columbia County, Wisconsin, 18-year-old Caroline Meeber, &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; to her family, takes the train to Chicago to live with her older sister Minnie and Minnie&#x27;s husband. On the train, Carrie meets Charles Drouet, a traveling salesman who is attracted to her because of her simple beauty and unspoiled manner. They exchange contact information, but upon discovering the &quot;steady round of toil&quot; and somber atmosphere at her sister&#x27;s flat, she writes to Drouet and discourages him from calling on her there.

Carrie soon finds a job running a machine in a shoe factory and gives most of her meager salary to the Hansons for room and board. One day, after an illness costs her job, she encounters Drouet. He persuades her to leave this dull, constricted life and move in with him. To press his case, he slips Carrie two $10 bills, opening a vista of material possibilities to her. The next day, he rebuffs her feeble attempt to return the money and retain her virtue, taking her shopping at a Chicago department store and buying her a jacket and some shoes. That night, she moves in with him.

Drouet installs her in a much nicer apartment. She gradually sheds her provincial mannerisms. By the time he introduces her to George Hurstwood, the manager of Fitzgerald and Moy&#x27;s – a respectable bar that Drouet describes as a &quot;way-up, swell place&quot; – her material appearance has improved considerably. Hurstwood, a married man with a social-climbing wife, a 20-year-old son, and a 17-year-old daughter, becomes infatuated with Carrie, and they start an affair, meeting secretly while Drouet is on a business trip.

One night, Drouet casually agrees to find an actress to play Laura in an amateur theatrical presentation of Augustin Daly&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Under the Gaslight&quot; for his local chapter of the Elks. He encourages a hesitant Carrie to take the part. Carrie turns out to have acting talent, and her ambition is born. Initially, she falls victim to stage fright, but Drouet&#x27;s encouragement between acts enables her to give a fine performance that rivets the audience&#x27;s attention and inflames Hurstwood&#x27;s passion. He then decides to take Carrie away from Drouet. 

The next day, Drouet finds out about the affair, and Hurstwood&#x27;s wife Julia learns that Hurstwood has been seen with another woman. Hurstwood makes advances, and when Carrie asks if he will marry her, he says yes. Later, Drouet confronts Carrie and informs her that Hurstwood is married, then walks out on her. After a night of drinking, and despairing at his now-emboldened wife&#x27;s demands and Carrie&#x27;s rejection letter, Hurstwood finds that the safe in Fitzgerald and Moy&#x27;s offices has accidentally been left unlocked. When he inadvertently locks the safe after taking the money out, he drunkenly panics and steals the day&#x27;s proceeds — more than $10,000. Under the false pretext of Drouet&#x27;s sudden illness, he lures Carrie onto a train and takes her to Canada. In Montreal, Hurstwood is found by a private investigator; he returns most of the stolen funds to avoid prosecution. Hurstwood mollifies Carrie by arranging a marriage ceremony (but he still is married to Julia), and the couple move to New York City.

They rent a flat, where they live as George and Carrie Wheeler. Hurstwood buys a minority interest in a saloon, and initially he can provide Carrie with an adequate, if not lavish, lifestyle. The couple grow distant, however, as their finances do not improve. Carrie&#x27;s dissatisfaction only increases when she makes friends with Mrs. Vance, a neighbor whose husband is prosperous. Through Mrs. Vance, Carrie meets Robert Ames, a young scholar from Indiana and her neighbor&#x27;s cousin, who introduces her to the idea that great art, rather than showy materialism, is worthy of admiration.

After only a few years, the saloon&#x27;s landlord sells the property, and Hurstwood&#x27;s business partner decides to terminate the partnership. Too proud to accept any of the limited job opportunities available to him, Hurstwood watches his savings dwindle. He urges Carrie to economize, which she finds humiliating and distasteful. As Hurstwood sinks into apathy, Carrie becomes a chorus girl through her good looks. While he deteriorates, she rises from the chorus line to small roles. Her performance as a minor, non-speaking character, a frowning Quakeress, greatly amuses the audience and makes the play a hit. She is befriended by Lola Osborne, another chorus girl, who urges Carrie to become her roommate. In a final attempt to earn money, Hurstwood becomes a scab, driving a Brooklyn streetcar during a streetcar operator&#x27;s strike. His ill-fated venture lasts only two days, ending after a couple of violent encounters with the strikers. Carrie, unaware of Hurstwood&#x27;s reason for quitting, leaves him.

Hurstwood ultimately becomes one of the homeless of New York, taking odd jobs, falling ill with pneumonia, and finally becoming a beggar. He ultimately commits suicide in a flophouse. Carrie achieves stardom, but finds that, even with fame and fortune, she is lonely and unhappy.

==Publication history and response==
At the urging of his journalist friend Arthur Henry, Dreiser began writing his manuscript in 1899. He frequently gave up on it but Henry urged him to continue. From the outset, his title was &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, but he changed it to &quot;The Flesh and the Spirit&quot; while writing it; he restored the original name once complete.

Dreiser had difficulty finding a publisher for &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;. Doubleday &amp; McClure Company accepted the manuscript, but the wife of one of the publishers declared it to be too sordid. Dreiser insisted on publication, and Doubleday &amp; McClure were legally bound to honor their contract; 1,008 copies were printed on November 8, 1900, but the publisher made no effort to advertise the book and only 456 copies were sold. However, Frank Norris, who was working as a reader at Doubleday, sent a few copies to literary reviewers.

From 1900 to 1980, all editions of the novel were of a second altered version. Dreiser&#x27;s unaltered version was not published until 1981, when the University of Pennsylvania Press issued a scholarly edition based upon the original manuscript held by the New York Public Library. It is a reconstruction by a team of leading scholars to represent the novel before it was edited by people other than Dreiser.

In his Nobel Prize Lecture of 1930, Sinclair Lewis said that &quot;Dreiser&#x27;s great first novel, &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, which he dared to publish thirty long years ago and which I read twenty-five years ago, came to housebound and airless America like a great free Western wind, and to our stuffy domesticity gave us the first fresh air since Mark Twain and Whitman.&quot;

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; 33rd on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

==Style and genre==
Theodore Dreiser is considered one of America&#x27;s great naturalists, significant because he wrote at the early stages of the naturalist movement. &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; was a movement away from the emphasis on morals of the Victorian era and focused more on realism and the base instincts of humans.

&quot;Sister Carrie&quot; went against social and moral norms of the time as Dreiser presented his characters without judging them. Dreiser fought against censorship of &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, brought about because Carrie engaged in affairs and other &quot;illicit sexual relationships&quot; without suffering any consequences. This flouted prevailing norms, that a character who practiced such sinful behavior must be punished in the course of the plot in order to be taught a lesson.

Dreiser sometimes has been criticized for his writing style. In 1930, Arnold Bennett stated &quot;Dreiser simply does not know how to write, never did know, never wanted to know.&quot; Other critics called his style &quot;vulgar&quot;, &quot;uneven&quot;, &quot;clumsy&quot;, &quot;awkward&quot;, and &quot;careless&quot;. His plots were decried as unimaginative, with critics citing his lack of education and claiming that he lacked intellectualism.

However, Alfred Kazin—while criticizing Dreiser&#x27;s style—pointed out that Dreiser&#x27;s novels had survived and remained influential works. Michael Lydon, in defense of Dreiser, claims that his patience and powers of observation created accurate depictions of the urban world and the desires and ambitions of the people of the time. Lydon stated that Dreiser&#x27;s intent was to focus on the message of &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, not on its writing style.

==General reception==
Theodore Dreiser&#x27;s &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; was not widely accepted after it was published, but it was not completely withdrawn by its publishers as some sources say it was. Neither was it received with the harshness that Dreiser reported. For example, the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; reported that the book &quot;is a faithful portraiture of the conditions it represents, showing how the tangle of human life is knotted thread by thread&quot; but that it was &quot;too realistic, too somber to be altogether pleasing&quot;. There is also the receipt of sale which Doubleday sent to Dreiser showing that &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; was not withdrawn from the shelves, reporting that 456 copies of the 1,008 copies printed were sold.

&quot;Sister Carrie&quot; evoked different responses from the critics, and although the book did not sell well among the general public, it often received positive reviews. Some of the reason for lack of sales came from a conflict between Dreiser and his publishers, who did little to promote the book. However, critics did praise the book, and a large number seemed most affected by the character of Hurstwood, such as the critic writing for the &quot;New Haven Journal Courier&quot;, who wrote &quot;One of the most affecting passages is where Hurstwood falls, ruined, disgraced.&quot; Edna Kenton in the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; wrote in 1900 that &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; is &quot;well worth reading simply for this account of Hurstwood&quot;.

Reviews mentioned the novel&#x27;s realistic depiction of the human condition. A 1901 review in &quot;The Academy&quot; wrote that &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; was &quot;absolutely free from the slightest trace of sentimentality or pettiness, and dominated everywhere by a serious and strenuous desire for truth.&quot; &quot;The London Express&quot; claimed that realism made the book appealing: &quot;It is a cruel, merciless story, intensely clever in its realism, and one that will remain impressed in the memory of the reader for many a long day.&quot; The novel has been praised for its accurate depiction of the protests in New York and the city life in Chicago.

Negative response to the novel came largely from the book&#x27;s sexual content, which made &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, in the words of the &quot;Omaha Daily Bee&quot; in 1900, &quot;not a book to be put into the hands of every reader indiscriminately.&quot; Another review in &quot;Life&quot; criticized Carrie&#x27;s success and warned &quot;Such girls, however, as imagine that they can follow in her footsteps will probably end their days on the Island or in the gutter.&quot; The book also was criticized for never mentioning the name of God.

Several critics complained the title made the book sound as if the main character is a nun. The title of the book was considered by &quot;The Newark Sunday News&quot; to be the &quot;weakest thing about the book&quot; because it &quot;does not bear the faintest relation to the story.&quot; Similarly, Frederic Taber Cooper in &quot;The Bookman&quot; declared it to be a &quot;colourless and misleading title&quot;. Other common complaints were about the length of the book and that it is so depressing that it is unpleasant to read.

While some viewed his work as grammatically and syntactically inaccurate, others found his detailed storytelling intriguing. H. L. Mencken, an avid supporter and friend, referred to Dreiser as &quot;a man of large originality, of profound feeling, and of unshakable courage&quot;. Mencken believed that Dreiser&#x27;s raw, honest portrayal of Carrie&#x27;s life should be seen as a courageous attempt to give the reader a realistic view of the life of women in the 19th century.

In opposition, one critic, Karl F. Zender, argued that Dreiser&#x27;s stress on circumstance over character was &quot;adequate neither to the artistic power nor to the culture implications of Sister Carrie&quot;. Many found Dreiser&#x27;s work attractive due to his lenient &quot;moralistic judgments&quot; and the &quot;spacious compassion&quot; in which he viewed his characters&#x27; actions. This tolerance of immorality was an entirely new idea for the readers of Dreiser&#x27;s era. In fact, the novel and its modern ideas of morality helped to produce a movement in which the literary generation of its time was found &quot;detaching itself from its predecessor&quot;. There remained some who disapproved of Dreiser&#x27;s immoral, atypical story. David E.E. Sloan argued that Dreiser&#x27;s novel undermined the general opinion that hard work and virtue bring success in life.

Although Dreiser has been criticized for his writing style and lack of formal education, &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; remains an influential example of naturalism and realism. While it initially did not sell well (fewer than 500 copies) and encountered censorship, it now is considered one of the great American urban novels, which explores the gritty details of human nature and the effect of industrialization on the American people.

== On screen and stage ==

<text>Barnegat Township (pronounced &quot;BAR-nuh-git&quot;) is a township in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 24,296, the highest ever count at a decennial census and an increase of 3,360 (+16.0%) from the 2010 census count of 20,936, which in turn reflected an increase of 5,666 (+37.1%) from the 15,270 counted in the 2000 census.

What is now Barnegat Township was originally incorporated as Union Township on March 10, 1846, from portions of both Dover Township (now Toms River Township) and Stafford Township, while the area was still part of Monmouth County. It became part of the newly formed Ocean County on February 15, 1850. Portions of the township were taken to form Lacey Township (March 23, 1871), Ocean Township (April 13, 1876), Harvey Cedars (December 13, 1894) and Long Beach Township (March 23, 1899). Union Township changed its name to Barnegat Township as of January 1, 1977.

==History==
Barnegat&#x27;s name can be traced back to Dutch explorers who, in 1614, mapped the coastline of the nearby Barnegat Bay and Barnegat Inlet. The original name for the inlet was &quot;Barendegat&quot; or &quot;Barnde Gat,&quot; which translates to &quot;inlet of the breakers&quot; or &quot;surf cove&quot;. These names were given due to the turbulent channel of the inlet, which is characterized by strong currents and choppy waters. An alternative theory suggests that &quot;Barndegat&quot; is a Dutch term meaning &quot;a pool created from a dike breach&quot;

Long before European settlers arrived, the Lenape Native Americans inhabited the region, including the area now known as Barnegat. The Lenape would spend their summers along the shore, collecting and roasting clams for sustenance during the winter months. They also fished, hunted, and gathered various fruits and nuts found in the area.

European settlers, primarily Dutch, English, and Swedes, began to arrive in the Barnegat area around 1720. These settlers were attracted to the region&#x27;s fertile land, abundant natural resources, and proximity to the coastline. The first permanent homes in Barnegat were constructed around 1750, as the settlers established farms, fisheries, and other small businesses.
Barnegat played a role in the American Revolutionary War, as one of the last skirmishes of the conflict took place near the site of the Cedar Bridge Tavern in 1782. Known as the &quot;Battle of Cedar Bridge,&quot; this encounter involved Patriot forces clashing with Loyalist troops and local Pine Robbers, who took advantage of the war&#x27;s chaos to engage in banditry. The Patriots eventually emerged victorious, marking a symbolic end to the Revolutionary War in New Jersey.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 40.41 square miles (104.65 km2), including 34,00 square miles (88.07 km2) of land and 6.40 square miles (16.58 km2) of water (15.85%).

<text>Barnegat Light (pronounced &quot;BAR-nuh-git&quot;) is a borough in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 640, an increase of 66 (+11.5%) from the 2010 census count of 574, which in turn reflected a decline of 190 (−24.9%) from the 764 counted in the 2000 census. The borough borders the Atlantic Ocean on Long Beach Island and is home to Barnegat Lighthouse.

Barnegat Light was formed as a borough by the New Jersey Legislature on November 2, 1948, to replace Barnegat City borough, which in turn had been created on March 29, 1904, from portions of Long Beach Township.

==History==
===Early history===

The area surrounding Barnegat Bay and Barnegat Inlet was described by Henry Hudson in 1609, as &quot;...a great lake of water, as we could judge it to be ... The mouth of the lake hath many shoals, and the sea breaketh on them as it is cast out of the mouth of it.&quot; The name of the bay, mainland town, and island town were extensions of the inlet&#x27;s name, named so in the 1610s by later Dutch mariners as &quot;barende-gat&quot; which was a general Dutch lingual description of a powerful inlet, not a formal place name, and depending on its context meant &quot;burning hole&quot; or &quot;inlet of breakers.&quot; Subsequent transliteration as control of the land changed hands throughout the 17th century Anglo-Dutch wars resulted in barende-gat and its variations becoming Barnegat and a formal name for many locations and features in the area.

On October 26, 1782, a Belgian cutter traveling southward became stranded near the inlet. The ship was noticed by revolutionaries led by Captain Andrew Steelman, who recruited local men to unload the cargo. While at rest on the beach, the crews were attacked by Captain John Bacon, who ran a pinelands gang and was affiliated with the Loyalists. Almost all of Steelman&#x27;s men were murdered in what became known as the Barnegat Light Massacre, which led to a manhunt and battle at Cedar Bridge Tavern and one of the last of the Revolutionary War.

By the 19th century, Long Beach Island was known for its plentiful and various wildlife, fishing, favorable sailing conditions, and pleasant weather in summer. In 1801, most of the northern tip of what was then commonly referred to as Barnegat Beach, a neighbor to the established mainland town of Barnegat across the bay, was purchased by Bornt Slaght, a founder of Staten Island and a revolutionary veteran, who built a small house, the first structure on the north end of Long Beach Island, and later, in 1821, a hotel, one of the first seaside hotels in New Jersey. In the late 1820s, Slaght sold his hotel to Jacob Herring, thereafter known as the Herring House. The building lodged many of the visiting hunters and sport fishermen, who primarily came from New York City and Philadelphia.

The first lighthouse at Barnegat Inlet was built in 1834 in recognition of the increased economic dependence on the inlet. Barnegat Inlet held a unique position of strategic regional and national importance. Maritime traffic to New York City, the gateway to the new world, relied upon Barnegat Light to navigate into New York harbor. The sheltered Barnegat Bay was a safe harbor and access point to inner bay ports, such as the Mullica and Toms rivers, down which came numerous commodities manufactured in the pine barrens, such as bog iron, and exported to the cities through Barnegat Bay. Cranberry Inlet, located between Ortley Beach and Seaside Heights, naturally opened by storm and tidal forces in 1750, was naturally closed again in 1812, cutting off a well-used and less treacherous entryway to the bay, making Barnegat Inlet the primary access point thereafter. The 1834 lighthouse was painted white, stood 40 feet tall, and was powered by a reflector system patented by Winslow Lewis, who also constructed the tower.

===Brownsville===
In 1854, John Maxon Brown, a wrecker from Manasquan, bought much of the land that makes up present-day Barnegat Light. This purchase included the acquisition of Herring House, which he renamed the Ashley House for his wife&#x27;s family. The family owned so much of the tiny town that people in the area colloquially called it Brownsville during this time. The powerful inlet caused a southward drift that began to threaten the 1834 lighthouse, which was also in poor condition due to substandard construction and was the subject of voluminous complaints from mariners due to its weak light. The lighthouse collapsed into the inlet in 1857, but not before a temporary wooden tower had been put into service while a superior replacement lighthouse was erected from 1857 to 1859.

The Brown family left the island in the 1870s after John Ashley Brown, John M. Brown&#x27;s son, by then a ship captain, died in a storm at sea. In 1874, the Brown&#x27;s sold the Ashley House to &quot;Uncle&quot; Charlie Martin, the former manager and cook. The United States Life-Saving Service built Station No. 17 on East 5th street in 1872, replacing an 1840s house of refuge nearby. The new station was later expanded in the 1890s. In the late 1860s, a general store and post office was constructed near the intersection of West 4th Street and Central Avenue. The general store was originally run by Lloyd and Lucretia Butterworth and provided limited supplies—largely due to the difficulty in transporting goods to the remote Island location in then equally remote coastal New Jersey. In 1919, the general store was purchased by the Applegate family who ran it well into the 20th century.

===Barnegat City===
In 1881, the Barnegat City Improvement Company was formed by Benjamin Franklin Archer, William F. Bailey, and a group of Camden, New Jersey investors. They intended to capitalize on the success of Atlantic City, as well as the then-popular temperance and health resort movements. They laid out streets, housing lots, hotels, a port, and a railroad, calling their planned seaside resort Barnegat City, emulating its popular southern neighbor Atlantic City. Their vision enjoyed limited success, as the city increased its already established reputation as a small but popular destination for sailors, sport fishermen, and hunters from Philadelphia and New York City, who in the early 1880s arrived on regional rail lines for part of the way and a steamboat across the bay to waiting carriages on the Island. Or in the earliest days, by traditional horse-drawn carriage the entire way to the bay steamboats. The 1886 construction of a railroad from Whiting and Toms River to the Island made the trip faster and easier, but still not as direct or convenient as that built for Philadelphians to Atlantic City. Local concerns lobbied for years to have a direct rail route constructed, but those efforts failed to make the Island as convenient and affordable of a day-trip to those in Philadelphia as Atlantic City was. Those coming from New York City took a ferry to Long Branch, then railroad to Toms River, and finally a steamboat from Toms River down Barnegat Bay to Barnegat City. The SS &quot;Hesse&quot;, a ship chartered by the Pennsylvania Railroad, began providing transport into Barnegat City for passengers largely originating from New York City and Trenton. This ship was later replaced by the &quot;Connetquot&quot;. The Oceanic Hotel, Sunset Hotel (initially San Souci Hotel), and Social were built as part of the original BCIC plan. The Oceanic opened in 1882, the Sunset in 1883, and the Social in 1884. The large Oceanic Hotel, located on East 4th Street, would be moved 300 feet west barely a year after opening due to sudden erosion threatening the hotel, which was placed atop leveled dunes at the very edge of the beach.

The Ashley House was sold to John Warner Kinsey in 1882, who rebranded it the Kinsey Hotel. He sold the old hotel not long after, the Ashley being antiquated and badly in need of repairs to compete with its larger more modern new neighbors in town. The hotel stood empty until 1887 when it was torn down. Between 1884 and 1886, a direct railroad connection was completed to increase the Island&#x27;s tourism capabilities. The first train reached Barnegat City on June 28, 1886. The lighthouse keeper&#x27;s house was greatly expanded in 1889 by the Federal Lighthouse Bureau to house the head keeper, his two assistants, and their families. During the Spanish–American War, signal houses were hurriedly constructed up and down the east coast, one of which was built in Barnegat City whose staff were charged with watching the seas for signs of Spanish ships. The brief war ended, however, before the houses could be put into service.

Barnegat City became part of Long Beach Township after the township&#x27;s establishment in 1899. In 1904, the city declared itself an independent borough and Barnegat City became the first officially recognized name for the storied old northern point of Long Beach Island.

In 1914, an automobile bridge was built next to the railroad bridge at the midpoint of the Island at Ship Bottom, eventually attracting more to the Island when roads and automobiles were plentiful but also increasing the devastating near term decline in railroad passenger and freight traffic vital to the Island&#x27;s trade and tourist economy, as well as livelihoods of most residents. In 1919, the struggling Oceanic Hotel sold and the somewhat more successful Sunset Hotel, catering to seasonal water fowl hunters, was purchased by John Barber. In 1928, Kaetzel&#x27;s Hotel and Bar was opened on West 7th Street by Paul and Toni Kaetzel. The bar was later purchased by Philadelphia bar owners Adamas &quot;Pop&quot; Kubelczikas and his wife Helena &quot;Mom&quot; Kubelczikas. They renamed the then bar and grill Kubel&#x27;s Bar, which still operates today.

A severe winter storm in 1920 caused significant erosion of the shoreline from the lighthouse to East and West 8th streets on the bay and ocean side of Barnegat City, eroding the shore up to the base of the lighthouse and prompting the abandonment and removal of the keeper&#x27;s house by the United States Lighthouse Service. The Oceanic Hotel owner planned to open it in the spring of 1920, but limited prospects for turning a profit and the dangerously close tides caused him to sell the hotel for salvage. Locals stripped and demolished the hotel a section at the time from the east end. The 1920 winter caused some damage to the hotel as well. Life-Saving Station No. 17 also had to be moved from its site at the end of East 5th Street to the middle of the block on East 7th Street. It was later replaced by a modern station across the street which still stands today as the Borough Hall. On the bay side, the port at 6th Street, populated by docks, boats, and fisherman and their families living in small cottages, began to erode as the inlet current wrapped around the contour of Barnegat City and scoured away at it from both sides. The disappearing town, as newspapers morbidly began writing of Barnegat City, which included frequent claims of the lighthouse near toppling and, in some sensationalist cases, claims that the lighthouse had toppled in a most recent storm, saw the end of the developers dreams from 1881. The block upon block of cottages they envisioned would be built, but it would take the next 60 years to be completed. In 1923, train service was discontinued from Barnegat City Junction at Ship Bottom to the entire north end of the Island, including the towns of Surf City and Harvey Cedars, and the tracks taken up shortly after due to low ridership, increasing maintenance costs to keep the aging railways passable, dilapidated locomotives and cars, and the growth of automobile traffic. This fate would follow for the southern branch of the Island railroad in 1935 when the train bridge was washed out in a nor&#x27;easter, while the regional shore lines would shutter in the 1940s.

A series of disasters in the area occurred during the 1930s, beginning with the destruction of the Sunset Hotel by fire in June 1932. On April 4, 1933, the Airship USS &quot;Akron&quot; crashed in the sea off Barnegat Light, resulting in the deaths of 73 of the airship&#x27;s crew of 76, still the most deadly airship disaster on record. In the era of airships from the late 1910s to the 1940s, nearby Navy base Lakehurst operated as the east coast port for all lighter-than-air traffic, including international flights from legendary craft such as the Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg. The Barnegat lighthouse and the inlet acted as a navigational point for airships from Lakehurst, making them a common sight in the skies above Barnegat City and parts of the Island. During World War II, airships were often seen as part of merchant convoys, providing anti-submarine services.

Barnegat City&#x27;s commercial fishing economy improved with a pound boat fishery opened by Captain Dick Myers in 1920, who built a dock at West 6th Street replacing the old eroded port. Also by the 1920s, a wave of immigration since 1900 had changed Barnegat City&#x27;s makeup as fishermen from Norway, Sweden, and Finland came to local waters after hearing of its reputation and solicitations from Myers to work his pound nets. In 1927 these Scandinavian fisherman united to form the Independent Fish Company and bought land further south to build their own dock complex that spanned West 17th to West 20th streets and remains active today. During this period, gillnetting declined in popularity, but it would later gain a comeback in the 1950s. Also in the 1950s, dragger fishing was ended and tilefishing began, the latter taking into the early 1970s before it became a profitable fishery and backbone, along with scalloping, of the evolving Barnegat Light commercial fishing industry.

The Independent Fish Company docks are now known as Viking Village and today provide a combined shopping and industrial establishment with both handcrafted goods and fresh seafood. Catches typically consist of scallops, tuna, swordfish, tilefish, weakfish, monkfish, bluefish, shad, dogfish, and various other types of in-shore fish. In the 1960s and 1970s, foreign trawlers, many international, were permitted to fish in the area, coming within a few miles of shore and fishing out several key species. Nearly all of the cod have been fished out of the area along with blue fish. The scallop boat &quot;Lindsay L&quot;, docked at Viking Village, was used in the movie &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;.

===Barnegat Light===
In 1948, Barnegat City was renamed as Barnegat Light after a referendum. The motivations for this renaming were both to honor the legacy of the lighthouse (which was decommissioned four years earlier) and to distinguish itself from nearby Barnegat Township. In 1950, the post office moved from the Applegate&#x27;s general store, which was falling into disrepair, to another general store on 18th Street. The building it replaced had itself been a general store and a gas station, both owned by Jens Jensen in 1920 who had given it to John Englesen in 1940 as a trade for a house on 19th Street. The post office remained at 18th Street until its current location on 10th Street was opened in the early 1960s when a borough hall and municipal complex was constructed. Town meetings had previously been held at the closed Barnegat City schoolhouse since 1951 and also the Barnegat Light Volunteer Firehouse hall. The site of the first post office, the general store on 4th Street, was saved and updated in the ensuing decades, operating today as the Inlet Deli.

The continued threat of storms such as the Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944 and the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 reinforced concerns about Barnegat Light&#x27;s survival in the long term and the survival of the lighthouse and beachfront homes in the near term. The first attempt at stabilizing the shoreline came in 1939-40 when a combination of rock jetties and earthen dams were used to reroute the inlet current away from the shoreline. The massive effort succeeded and stopped the erosion that had doomed the eastern beach blocks, threatened the lighthouse, and erased the former port at 6th street. A diagonal jetty extending hundreds of yards NNE from East 8th Street forced the current far away from land before it entered the channel between the lighthouse and southern tip of Island Beach, while the damming of the existing current&#x27;s channel along the backside of the Island between West 20th Street and High Bar, plus the damming of a channel between High Bar and an island WNW of the inlet, rerouted the current a mile north and west of Barnegat Light, sending it farther into the bay away from the town. The construction of the existing jetty in the early 1990s further stabilized the earlier work, straightening the southern jetty of the inlet and reclaiming virtually all of the eastern shoreline from East 8th Street to the lighthouse that was lost over the last century, much of which was not redeveloped and instead designated as parkland, which in 2020 included the addition of a bird sanctuary. The jetties have provided stabilization to the shoreline and especially the previously unstable and occasionally shallow inlet. To maintain the channel, the inlet requires annual dredging by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In addition to the lighthouse, Barnegat Light continues to host a United States Coast Guard station, now located on the bay at West 6th Street, reflecting the continued presence of the former United States Life-Saving Service and its vital duties on the still treacherous waters of Barnegat Inlet and out on the Barnegat shoals. In line with the borough&#x27;s history, its most prominent industries continue to be tourism and fishing.

==Government==

===Local government===

Barnegat Light is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Barnegat Light is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Barnegat Light is Republican Kirk O. Larson Sr., whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Michael W. Spark (R, 2024), Mary Ellen Foley (R, 2026), James M. Gutowski (R, 2025), Frank F. Mikuletzky Jr. (R, 2022), Dorothy Reynolds (R, 2026) and Edwin Wellington Jr. (R, 2024).

The borough council selected Edwin Wellington Jr. in October 2013 to fill the vacant seat of Dave Bossi expiring in 2015. Wellington served on an interim basis until the November 2014 general election, when voters choose him to serve the balance of the term through December 2015.

====Emergency services====
Police protection in the borough is provided under contract by the Long Beach Township Police Department.

Barnegat Light is served by both a volunteer fire department as well as a volunteer first aid squad. The Barnegat Light Volunteer Fire Company, established in 1937, covers Barnegat Light, High Bar Harbor, and parts of Loveladies. The Barnegat Light First Aid Squad covers all of the north end of Long Beach Island ending at the Surf City North Beach border.

===Federal, state and county representation===
Barnegat Light is located in the 2nd Congressional district and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s 9th state legislative district. Prior to the 2010 Census, Barnegat Light had been part of the , a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections.

==Education==
In 1903, the Barnegat City School was built on West 5th Street and Central Ave, consisting of a single room with bathrooms and coat closets in the entranceways, of which there was one for boys and one for girls. An older school based out of a residential cottage on West 3rd Street previously educated small classes of children from the 1880s. Shortly after the new school was opened, the former school and neighboring houses caught fire. The one-room school closed in 1951 at the end of the school year due to increasing class sizes after World War II and the plan to consolidate the Island town schools under one roof, which became the Ethel A. Jacobsen Elementary School in Surf City and later the additional LBI Grade School in Ship Bottom.

For pre-kindergarten through sixth grade, public school students attend the Long Beach Island Consolidated School District, which also serves students from Harvey Cedars, Long Beach Township, Ship Bottom and Surf City. As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of two schools, had an enrollment of 215 students and 30.7 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 7.0:1. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Ethel Jacobsen School in Surf City with 111 students in pre-kindergarten to second grade and 
Long Beach Island Grade School in Ship Bottom with 125 students in grades 3–6. The district&#x27;s board of education is comprised of nine members who are directly elected from the constituent municipalities on a staggered basis, with three members elected each year. Of the nine seats, one is elected from Barnegat Light.

Students in public school for seventh through twelfth grades attend the Southern Regional School District, which serves the five municipalities in the Long Beach Island Consolidated School District, along with students from Beach Haven and Stafford Township, as well as students from Ocean Township (including its Waretown section) who attend as part of a sending/receiving relationship. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Southern Regional Middle School with 902 students in grades 7–8 and 
Southern Regional High School with 1,975 students in grades 9–12. Both schools are in the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality and by Ocean County.

No Interstate, U.S. or state highways serve Barnegat Light. The main road serving the borough is County Route 607 (Central Avenue and Broadway).

===Public transportation===
Ocean County Ride provides bus service on the OC9 LBI North route between Barnegat Light and Manahawkin / Stafford Township.

<doc id="125593" wikidata="Q1086404" url="?curid=125593" title="Bay Head, New Jersey">
<text>Bay Head is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore in northern Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 930, a decrease of 38 (−3.9%) from the 2010 census count of 968, which in turn reflected a decline of 270 (−21.8%) from the 1,238 counted in the 2000 census. Bay Head is situated on the Barnegat Peninsula, also known as Barnegat Bay Island, a long, narrow barrier island that separates Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. Together with Mantoloking, Bay Head is considered part of the Jersey Shore&#x27;s &quot;Gold Coast&quot;.

Bay Head was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on June 15, 1886, from portions of Brick Township, based on the results of a referendum held three days earlier.

The community was supposed to have been named &quot;Bayhead&quot; after the Bayhead Land Company that developed the area in the 1870s. A railroad sign posted in the 1880s labeled the station as &quot;Bay Head,&quot; and the name stuck when the borough was incorporated in 1886. The name also comes from the town&#x27;s location, which is at the &quot;head&quot; of Barnegat Bay.

==History==

The Bayhead Land Company was incorporated on September 6, 1879, capitalized at $12,000. The founding partners were David H. Mount of Rocky Hill, and three Princeton men: Edward Howe, his brother Leavitt Howe and William Harris.

<text>Beach Haven is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore in southern Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough is located on Long Beach Island (LBI) and borders the Atlantic Ocean. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,027, a decrease of 143 (−12.2%) from the 2010 census count of 1,170, which in turn reflected a decline of 108 (−8.5%) from the 1,278 counted in the 2000 census.

Beach Haven was incorporated as a Borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 11, 1890, from portions of Eagleswood Township, based on the results of a referendum held five days earlier.

Beach Haven, known as the &quot;Queen City,&quot; is a late 19th-century beachfront resort originally established in 1873 to house wealthy summer residents from Philadelphia. Although some of the major structures, including several hotels and a boardwalk, were lost to storms in the 1940s including the Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944, a large portion of the town retains its Victorian and Edwardian character. The Beach Haven Historic District listed in the New Jersey and the National Register of Historic Places in the early 1980s, encompasses the most intact buildings at the core of the resort.

<text>Beach Haven West is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) constituting a part of the Jersey Shore community of Stafford Township, in southern Ocean County, within the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 4,143, an increase of 247 (+6.3%) from the 3,896 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn had reflected a decrease of 548 (−12.3%) from the 4,444 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
The site that Beach Haven West is located on was known as Remson Meadows along the Manahawkin Bayfront. In 1950, the salt marshes were bought by the Shapiro brothers, Herbert and Jerome, who developed vacation homes throughout the Jersey Shore. Using a dredge towed up from North Carolina, construction began on Beach Haven West&#x27;s 130-plus saltwater lagoons and 5,000 single-family homes.

Beach Haven West was built in phases, the first opening in 1957. The first phase contained the lagoons and cul-de-sacs branching between Morris Boulevard and Jennifer Lane. By the early 1960s, the second phase was completed, this one spanning between Jonathan Drive and Walter Boulevard. Afterwards, the third phase was completed, which contained the development along Mill Creek Road between Route 72 and Jonathan Drive, as well as the Charles Boulevard spur. By the 1970s, the lagoon-front community was expanded down Mill Creek Road towards East Point.

The Shapiros later sold their remaining properties to Lincoln Properties, LLC, another shore development firm. They completed the Mill Creek Road section along Mill Creek down to Barnegat Bay at East Point, added the southern lagoons along Newell Avenue known as Village Harbour, and developed the Colony Lakes section by 1986.

Through satellite imagery, it is evident that the community was intended to expand below the delta of Mill Creek at the bay. Ghosts of about a dozen partially dredged lagoons in that area, as well as a curious curve in Newell Avenue, indicate the planned expansion. However, a lack of permits, increasing pressure from the EPA and the Wetlands Protection Act of 1970 kept the community from expanding further.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Beach Haven West had a total area of , including of land and of water (25.47%).

The name &quot;Beach Haven West&quot; is a misnomer because it actually lies directly due north from the borough of Beach Haven. It can be speculated that &quot;west&quot; was chosen because the mainland is generally west of Long Beach Island, where Beach Haven is located.

==Community==
Many of the homes in Beach Haven West are summer residences for those who live in other parts of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida and other states, although year-round residents have become more frequent. The area is served by the Stafford Township School District from grades K-6, and the Southern Regional School District from grades 7–12.

===Homes===
The first model home, an expandable Cape Cod-style house, opened on Selma Drive in 1957. Like many Capes, this home had one finished floor with two bedrooms, the attic was capable of expansion with dormers, and there was an outside shower. The style was pure 1950s: wide-exposure asbestos siding, aluminum jalousie windows throughout, and dark wood paneling inside. The colors were all pastels, ranging from canary yellow, pistachio green, and bright pink, to name a few. Mass production methods were utilized to erect the homes efficiently.

The lots were all 50 feet wide along the lagoon and 80 feet deep running towards the street. Phase one featured lots. Double lots and irregular lots were available along the bends and corners of the lagoon. In the 1950s, waterfront lots with a house sold for $6,990, and financing of $66 a month was available.

Soon, additional models were added and the two-bedroom cape was dropped. The least expensive was the Sandpiper model, totaling $11,990. which was a 3 bedroom ranch. Keeping the same modern architectural style, the three bedrooms were arranged along the front of the house facing the street. Behind them was a single full bath, a kitchenette, and a living room. All interior spaces featured exposed rafter vaulted ceilings with rigid insulation on the roof. Base models featured a screened porch stretching completely across the back of the house, which was covered by a long, gently sloping roof. A common upgrade was to have the porch enclosed with jalousie windows. The home was completed with an outdoor shower, an option of either a wooden bulkhead &quot;or&quot; a wooden deck along the lagoon, and two young willow trees in the back yard.

The largest model available was the Continental Riviera, which sold for about $23,000 in the 1970s. Homes in East Point and Village Harbour were built in the typical 1980s Post-Modern style. Colony Lakes homes were Colonial representative. All homes built by Lincoln were reversed living homes, where the bedrooms were downstairs and the living spaces on the second floor.

===Beach Haven West Civic Association===
Originally, the community had a recreation center located at intersection of Jonathan Drive, Morris Boulevard, Jennifer Lane, and Jeffrey Drive. The rec center featured a clubhouse, boat slips, and a swimming pool, which was the center of the Beach Haven West social scene throughout the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1980s, the pool was infilled and the clubhouse demolished. Modern 1980s-style homes were later built on the site, and belong to some of few homes in the complex which do not have waterfront access.

The Civic Association has been revitalized, and continues to operate at a new location on Mill Creek Road. It serves the community in many capacities, from &quot;Mom and Me&quot; playgroups and other Stafford Recreation-sponsored programs, to other usergroup functions (Stafford Township Regular Republican Club meetings) as well as a voting location on Election Days.

<text>Beachwood is a borough situated in the Jersey Shore region, within Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 10,859, a decrease of 186 (−1.7%) from the 2010 census count of 11,045, which in turn reflected an increase of 670 (+6.5%) from the 10,375 counted in the 2000 census.

Beachwood was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 22, 1917, from portions of Berkeley Township, based on the results of a referendum held on April 12, 1917.

==History==
What is now the borough of Beachwood dates its settlement to a 1914 plan backed by the publishers of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, under which of Berkeley Township were purchased and sectioned off as a summer colony called &quot;Beachwood&quot;. Buyers paid $19.60 for a plot of land measuring and received a six-month subscription to &quot;The Tribune&quot; as a bonus. The first residents of the community moved in during April 1915, and work on a Club House, the Pier, the Bath House, the Lodge, a dining hall and a railroad station were planned to be completed by the end of May. Other offerings within the development included tennis courts, and facilities along the beach and on the river for canoeing, sailing and swimming. The first &quot;cottages&quot; in the community were constructed during that first summer season.

A Property-Owner&#x27;s Association was established in 1916. In addition to overseeing local services within the development, the organization also advocated that the community should become an independent municipality. Legislation was passed by the Legislature on March 22, 1917, and a referendum approving the establishment of the borough passed on April 12. On May 11, the borough&#x27;s first council was elected, along with Joseph H. Senior, who was chosen by the voters as Beachwood&#x27;s first mayor. A board of education was formed the following year, with school transportation provided on the back of a truck outfitted with wooden benches.

In December 2008, the Beachwood Historical Alliance was established, with the goal of the creation of an official town-run Preservation Commission for the purpose of recognizing, restoring and preserving aspects of Beachwood&#x27;s formation, history, and heritage.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.76 square miles (7.16 km2), including 2.76 square miles (7.16 km2) of land and &lt;0.01 square miles (&lt;0.01 km2) of water (0.04%).

==Government==

===Local government===

Beachwood was originally governed under the Walsh Act commission form of government, which was maintained until the mid-1970s. Beachwood is now governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Beachwood is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council.

<text>Berkeley Township is a township in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, extending from the Jersey Shore westward into the New Jersey Pine Barrens. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 43,754, the highest ever in any decennial count and an increase of 2,499 (+6.1%) from the 2010 census count of 41,255, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,264 (+3.2%) from the 39,991 counted in the 2000 census.

Berkeley Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 31, 1875, from portions of Dover Township (now Toms River Township). Sections of the township were taken to form Seaside Park (March 3, 1898), Seaside Heights (February 6, 1913), Beachwood (March 22, 1917), Ocean Gate (February 28, 1918) Pine Beach (February 26, 1925), South Toms River (March 28, 1927), and Island Beach (June 23, 1933, reabsorbed into Berkeley Township in 1965). The township was named for John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, one of the founders of the Province of New Jersey.

==History==
Army officer Lt. Edward Farrow began buying up woodland in the 1880s with the idea of building a retirement community for former Army and Navy officers. Farrow built a railroad station, shops and even a resort hotel called The Pines with the idea of attracting people. But only 11 people ever built houses in what Farrow called &quot;Barnegat Park,&quot; and eventually he went bankrupt.

In the 1920s, Benjamin W. Sangor purchased the area, intending to create a resort town catering to wealthy urban vacationers. Between 1928 and 1929, about 8,000 lots were sold in Pinewald, a &quot;new-type, residential, recreational city-of-the sea-and-pines.&quot; It was to contain a golf course, recreation facilities, and estate homes.

The developers immediately began construction of the Pinewald pavilion and pier at the end of Butler Avenue. The Royal Pines Hotel, a $1.175 million investment facing Crystal Lake, was built on the site of an earlier hotel dating back to the days of Barnegat Park. It was the focal point of the new community. The hotel was also used as an asylum, then later a nursing home now known as the Crystal Lake Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation Center.

The hotel was constructed by Russian architect W. Oltar-Jevsky in the early 1920s. Al Capone may have frequented its halls, perhaps even venturing beneath the lake in tunnels especially designed for smuggling alcohol during Prohibition. One newspaper article interviewed an unidentified man who claimed that &quot;in the early 1930s the then Royal Pines Hotel was frequented by society&#x27;s elite who, for $1.90 a drink, consumed prohibition liquor under the watchful eye of men who had guns strapped under their coats.&quot; In 1929, during the Great Depression, this resort community also went bankrupt.

<doc id="125598" wikidata="Q2637971" url="?curid=125598" title="Brick Township, New Jersey">
<text>Brick Township is a township situated on the Jersey Shore within Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city retained its position as the state&#x27;s 13th-most-populous municipality, with a population of 73,620, a decrease of 1,452 (−1.9%) from the 2010 census count of 75,072, which in turn reflected a decline of 1,047 residents (−1.4%) from its population of 76,119 at the 2000 census, when it was the state&#x27;s 12th most-populous municipality.

A majority of Brick Township is located on the mainland. Ocean Beaches I, II, and III are situated on the Barnegat Peninsula, a long, narrow barrier peninsula that separates Barnegat Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. The mainland and beach area of the town are not geographically adjacent. Brick Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 15, 1850, from portions of both Dover Township (now Toms River Township) and Howell Township. The township was named after Joseph Brick, the owner of Bergen Iron Works located on the Metedeconk River. Portions of the township were taken to form Point Pleasant Beach (May 18, 1886), Bay Head (June 15, 1886), Lakewood Township (March 23, 1892), Mantoloking (April 10, 1911) and Point Pleasant (April 21, 1920). In 1963, voters rejected a referendum that would have changed the township&#x27;s name to &quot;Laurelton&quot;.

After hovering for years in the top five, in 2006, the township earned the title of &quot;America&#x27;s Safest City&quot;, out of 371 cities included nationwide in the 13th annual Morgan Quitno survey. Since the year 2000, Brick Township has been the safest &quot;city&quot; (population over 75,000) in New Jersey. In 2003 and 2004, Brick Township was ranked as the second safest city in the United States, after Newton, Massachusetts. In 2005, Brick Township had dropped down to the fifth safest &quot;city&quot; (population over 75,000) in the United States, before it rebounded to the top in 2006.

==History==
The Havens Homestead Museum is dedicated to the Havens family that originally settled in the Laurelton/Burrsville section of Brick. The museum is the original Havens home which lies on a small plot of farmland. The museum has a gift shop and runs tours of the property daily.

Brick Township has also been in the news for a claimed autism epidemic, in which 40 children out of over 6,000 surveyed were found to be autistic, though Brick&#x27;s autism rate is statistically near the national average. Many of the children found to be autistic were born in Northern New Jersey and other parts of the country. There is no evidence that the levels of autism are linked to any specific environmental factor in Brick. Parents of children diagnosed with autism have moved to the township in order to make use of the special education programs offered by the school district.

Brick has been affected by the heroin epidemic. According to the state&#x27;s statistics, in 2012 Brick was ranked sixth in the state with 550 reported incidents of heroin or opiate abuse, behind Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Atlantic City and Camden. In 2017, Brick improved to 438 reported heroin abuse cases, ranked ninth in the state.

On July 11, 2004, Brick Memorial High School student, Brittney Gregory went missing. The news of her disappearance went on national news. Her body was found in a shallow grave, after a woman led the police to the area, just off. Suspect Jack Fuller Jr., a drug addict and acquaintance to Gregory&#x27;s father admitted to killing Gregory. Fuller stated that he was giving her a ride to her boyfriend&#x27;s house. Fuller began smoking crack in the car and Gregory became upset. Fuller punched Gregory several times and when she died, he buried her.

During the December 2010 North American blizzard, Brick Township received of snow, the highest accumulation recorded in the state. In October 2012, parts of Brick were devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Barrier island and other waterfront properties were particularly hard hit. Homes and such buildings as the Shore Acres Yacht Club sustained major damage; some buildings had to be demolished.

==Geography==

===Local government===
The township operates within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Mayor-Council plan 2 form of government, as implemented on January 1, 1990, based on direct petition. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is composed of the Mayor and the seven-member Township Council, whose members are elected to serve four-year terms of office, with either three seats (and the mayoral seat) or four seats up for election at-large in partisan elections held on a staggered basis in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected for a four-year term without limitation as to the number of terms. In November 1988, the voters approved a referendum which returned the township to the partisan system of government, with township elections held as part of the November general election (rather than in May).

The mayor is the township&#x27;s chief executive and administrative officer and is responsible for administering local laws and policy development. The mayor makes various appointments, prepares the township&#x27;s budget, and approves or vetoes ordinances adopted by the Township Council (which may be overridden by a ⅔ vote of the Township Council). The mayor appoints, with the advice and consent of the Township Council, the business administrator, the township attorney, and the directors of the Departments of Public Safety, Engineering and Public Works.

, the mayor of Brick Township is Democrat Lisa Crate, who was appointed to serve a term of office ending on December 31, 2025.

Ambrosino (D, 2027), Heather deJong (D, 2025), Marianna Pontoriero (D, 2025) and Melissa Travers (D, 2027).

Ducey&#x27;s resignation to take a seat as a New Jersey Superior Court Judge; Crate served on an interim basis pending the November 2023 special election where she defeated Assemblyman John Catalano. In turn, the council selected Melissa Travers to fill the vacant council seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Crate.

In October 2022, the council appointed Derrick Ambrosino to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Arthur Halloran until his resignation the previous month.

In January 2014, the Township Council appointed Andrea Zapcic to fill the vacant council seat expiring in December 2015 of John G. Ducey after he took office as mayor. Zapcic won election in November 2014 to serve the balance of the term.

Ducey was elected as mayor in 2013, garnering 62% of the vote to defeat Republican opponent Joseph Sangiovanni.

Former Democratic Mayor Joseph C. Scarpelli resigned as of December 8, 2006, amid a federal corruption probe into township government. On January 8, 2007, Scarpelli pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges for accepting money from developers in exchange for using his official position to obtain approval for development projects. Township Clerk Virginia Lampman was appointed to fill the role of mayor until the Township Council could select a replacement. On December 17, 2007, Scarpelli was sentenced in Federal Court in Newark to serve 18 months in prison, and fined $5,000, after admitting that he had accepted bribes from 1998 to 2003.

On January 4, 2007, Daniel J. Kelly (D), the Township&#x27;s Planning Board chairman, was appointed the new mayor by a three-member township council subcommittee. On November 6, 2007, Stephen C. Acropolis defeated Kelly in a race to fill the remaining two years of Scarpelli&#x27;s term.

Further development continued in 1883 with the construction of a Coast Guard Lifesaving Station and the completion of the Pennsylvania Railroad on the peninsula, which included a stop at Chadwick Beach. The area was opened to major development after the completion of what is now Route 35 in 1913. The area saw its largest growth as a vacation resort in the middle of the 20th century.

<text>Harvey Cedars is a coastal borough situated on the Jersey Shore, in southern Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough encompasses a narrow strip of Long Beach Island fronting both the Atlantic Ocean and Barnegat Bay. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 391, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 54 (+16.0%) from the 2010 census count of 337, which in turn reflected a decline of 22 (−6.1%) from the 359 counted in the 2000 census.

Harvey Cedars was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on December 15, 1894, from portions of Union Township (now Barnegat Township), based on the results of a referendum held on November 20, 1894. The community&#x27;s post office was initially known as High Point, the name of a neighborhood in the borough that lies at a higher elevation, before a name change was made in the 1930s at the request of the United States Postal Service to differentiate the post office from the northern New Jersey community of High Point in Sussex County.

The majority of the housing units in the borough are seasonal houses used primarily in the summer by owners who live elsewhere, bringing the summer population to 12,000. The borough&#x27;s quiet character and bay and ocean access make housing very expensive, with many bay or oceanfront houses priced at $2 million or more. Despite the borough&#x27;s small size, its property was assessed at over $1.28 billion in 2019.

== History ==
Before Long Beach Island was developed, its northern area, from the Barnegat Inlet to the Great Swamp (now Surf City), was covered with Atlantic white cedar (chamaecyparis thyoides). Early inhabitants of the area harvested salt hay (spartina patens) and seaweed to make a living.

The earliest reference to the area was a deed from 1751 that called the place &quot;Harvest Quarters&quot;. The name &quot;Harvey Cedars&quot; may be derived from the &quot;harvest&quot; housing used by these farmers and the &quot;cedars&quot; that grew in the area.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.19 square miles (3.08 km2), including 0.56 square miles (1.45 km2) of land and 0.63 square miles (1.62 km2) of water (52.61%).

== Education ==
For pre-kindergarten through sixth grade, public school students attend the Long Beach Island Consolidated School District, which also serves students from Barnegat Light, Long Beach Township, Ship Bottom and Surf City. As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of two schools, had an enrollment of 215 students and 30.7 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 7.0:1. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Ethel Jacobsen School in Surf City with 111 students in pre-kindergarten to second grade and 
Long Beach Island Grade School in Ship Bottom with 125 students in grades 3–6. The district&#x27;s board of education is comprised of nine members who are directly elected from the constituent municipalities on a staggered basis, with three members elected each year. Of the nine seats, one is elected from Harvey Cedars.

Students in public school for seventh through twelfth grades attend the Southern Regional School District, which serves the five municipalities in the Long Beach Island Consolidated School District, along with students from Beach Haven and Stafford Township, as well as students from Ocean Township (including its Waretown section) who attend as part of a sending/receiving relationship. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Southern Regional Middle School with 902 students in grades 7–8 and 
Southern Regional High School with 1,975 students in grades 9–12. Both schools are in the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township.

At the time of its founding in 1957, the Southern Regional School District had a roughly equal number of students from Long Beach Island and Stafford Township.
By 2016, the overwhelming majority of students were from Stafford Township, accounting for nearly 90% of enrollment. These demographic changes have led to significant discrepancies in the cost per pupil sent to the district from each community, with Harvey Cedars and Long Beach Township paying more than $200,000 per pupil, while Stafford Township&#x27;s costs are $3,600 for each student. These widely different costs result from a formula that uses the taxable property value in each municipality to apportion costs, which means that municipalities with relatively high property values and small numbers of students pay a higher share of total district costs. Some residents of Long Beach Island communities are seeking to amend the formula to take advantage of a 1993 law that allows districts to use both property value and enrollment to allocate property taxes, though that would require passage of referendums in each municipality.

==History==
Island Heights was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 6, 1887, from portions of Dover Township (now Toms River Township), based on the results of a referendum held on November 18, 1886.

Island Heights takes its name from two sources: it originally was an island. It is situated by a steep bluff rising above the Toms River. It was originally known as Doctor Johnson&#x27;s island, being included in the patent granted to him in 1680. In the century before the American Revolutionary War, it was known as Dillon&#x27;s Island, probably for James Dillon, a prominent man in Toms River. The land was purchased by John Imlay of Allentown, who sold it in 1794 to Issac Gulick. In 1797, Gulick and his wife Abagail sold it to Abraham and George Parker. In 1799, the Parker brothers sold it to Abel Middleton of Upper Freehold Township.

<text>Jackson Township is a township in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A portion of the township is located within the Pinelands National Reserve. As of the 2020 United States Census, the township&#x27;s population was 58,544, an increase of 3,688 (+6.7%) from the 2010 census count of 54,856, which in turn reflected an increase of 12,040 (+28.1%) from the 42,816 counted in the 2000 census.

Roughly equidistant between New York City and Philadelphia, along with being close to the state capital of Trenton and the Jersey Shore on Interstate 195, Jackson has rapidly grown as an outer-ring suburb of New York within the New York metropolitan area. Jackson is also the site of Six Flags Great Adventure, of Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, and of Safari Off Road Adventure, which replaced Six Flags Wild Safari Adventure in 2013, and Adventure Crossing a mixed-use entertainment complex that opened in 2023.

==History==
Jackson Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 6, 1844, from portions of Dover Township (now Toms River Township), Freehold Township and Upper Freehold Township, while the area was still part of Monmouth County. The township was named for president Andrew Jackson, a year before his death. It became part of the newly created Ocean County on February 15, 1850. Portions of the township were taken to form Plumsted Township on March 11, 1845.
On July 1, 1974, under the direction of New York based entrepreneur Warner LeRoy, Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park opened in Jackson Township. It first opened to the public as simply &quot;Great Adventure&quot; in 1974, it was later acquired by the larger Six Flags brand in 1977. To accommodate for the rise in tourism in the township, in 1997 Simon Property Group opened Jackson Premium Outlets, an open-air outlet power center.

Adventure Crossing opened in January 2023, located between Jackson Premium Outlets and Six Flags Great Adventure. The mixed-use complex features fast-food restaurants, a gas station and a family entertainment complex (with a sports bubble that has 42 Top Golf bays, axe throwing, virtual reality rides, and additional restaurants and bars). When completed, the complex will also have a surf pool, turf fields, luxury apartments, Hilton hotels, conference centers, a medical arts facility and other mixed-use amenities for business, lifestyle, healthcare, and leisure.

On April 1, 2023, two separate tornadoes rated EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale struck Jackson Township, with winds of up to . The first tornado struck western sections of the township near County Route 537 (Monmouth Road), inflicting significant damage to the Adventure Crossing USA mixed-use complex (causing the sports bubble to actually collapse), a newly built warehouse development and several homes. The second tornado struck near the border with neighboring Howell Township near the Aldrich Road area. The National Weather Service confirmed that the path of the tornado was wide and long. Both of these tornadoes were some of the strongest recorded to have hit the state and were part of four separate powerful tornadoes that had impacted the state in the outbreak.

===Orthodox Jewish community===
Since 2016, the Orthodox Jewish population has been growing in central and eastern Jackson Township, along the border with Lakewood Township, due to the more affordable housing and quieter lifestyle that Jackson Township offers over Lakewood. By 2020, the Orthodox Jewish community had grown to approximately 500 families, out of 19,400 total households, from a limited presence just a few years prior.

A series of pending lawsuits allege that Jackson Township has passed multiple ordinances trying to stymie movement from Lakewood to Jackson. A &quot;no knock&quot; ordinance had been passed by Jackson prohibiting door-to-door solicitation after residents complained of an increase in real estate solicitations. Ordinances were passed that were restrictive to the Orthodox Jewish lifestyle; efforts to open yeshivas in the township, often accompanied by dormitories, were blocked by newly adopted ordinances that restricted new schools and prohibited dormitories. &quot;Eruvs&quot; (symbolic religious enclosures) were determined not to meet building and construction codes after a new ordinance was passed that tightened restrictions on items placed in the public &quot;right-of-way&quot;. To address this last concern, the township entered into a preliminary settlement allowing &quot;eruvs&quot; in some parts of township and proposed a township-wide solution that was ultimately deemed impractical.

In addition, the United States Department of Justice and the New Jersey Attorney General have opened investigations into whether the township practiced anti-Semitic discrimination, filing multiple subpoenas against township officials. These investigations culminated in May 2020 with a federal lawsuit brought by the Department of Justice against the township, alleging violations of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the Fair Housing Act related to the township&#x27;s new land use laws.

In June 2011, the Township Council passed an ordinance shifting nonpartisan elections from May to November.

<doc id="125614" wikidata="Q1074483" url="?curid=125614" title="Lacey Township, New Jersey">
<text>Lacey Township is a township in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey and is considered part of the Jersey Shore and South Jersey regions, as well as of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 28,655, an increase of 1,011 (+3.7%) from the 2010 census count of 27,644, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,298 (+9.1%) from the 25,346 counted in the 2000 census. The 2010 population was the highest recorded in any decennial census. It was named for Continental Army General John Lacey.

Lacey Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1871, from portions of Dover Township (now known as Toms River Township) and Union Township (now Barnegat Township). Portions of the township were taken on June 23, 1933, to form the borough of Island Beach (which is now Island Beach State Park, part of Berkeley Township). The township was named for Revolutionary War brigadier general John Lacey, who developed Ferrago Forge in 1809.

The Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station is located in the southern part of the township. The single-unit 636 MWe boiling water reactor power plant adjoins the Oyster Creek and is owned and operated by Exelon Corporation. It produced 9% of the state&#x27;s electricity and is the nation&#x27;s oldest operating nuclear power plant, having first been brought online on December 1, 1969, and is licensed to operate until April 9, 2029. In 2010, Exelon announced that it would close the facility in 2019 as part of an agreement with the State of New Jersey under which the plant would be allowed to operate without cooling towers. The plant, which had contributed a third of the township&#x27;s budget through taxes, was closed in September 2018, after which a decommissioning process estimated to take eight years and cost $1.4 billion was to be undertaken.

Murray Grove is a Unitarian-Universalist retreat and conference center in Lanoka Harbor, traditionally considered the site where Universalism in America began.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 99.81 square miles (258.49 km2), including 83.25 square miles (215.62 km2) of land and 16.55 square miles (42.87 km2) of water (16.58%).

Forked River (with a 2010 Census population of 5,244) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Lacey Township. Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Aserdaten, Bamber Lake, Barnegat Pines, Batuber, Cedar Creek, Cedar Crest, Deer Head Lake, Good Luck, Lake Barnegat, Lanoka Harbor, Osteam, Red Oak Grove, Union Clay Works and Webbs Mill. The township&#x27;s fire stations are named after the various areas of Lacey Township.

The township borders the Ocean County municipalities of Barnegat Township, Berkeley Township, Manchester Township and Ocean Township, as well as Woodland Township in Burlington County.

The north–south track of the Garden State Parkway serves as an informal use divider under the 1979 Pinelands Act and the subsequent Comprehensive Management Plan. To the east of the Parkway are more than 95% of Lacey&#x27;s residential dwellings, located in the unincorporated areas of Lanoka Harbor and Forked River. To the Parkway&#x27;s west is a mostly undisturbed pine and cedar forest, part of New Jersey&#x27;s vast Pine Barrens. The forest is interspersed with a scattered few farms, houses and ranches, the tiny community of Bamber Lakes and open pit gravel quarries—all of which predate passage of the Pinelands Act or were developed under its tight zoning rules. The conditions of grandfathering vary—the mines&#x27; exceptions are to expire upon the deaths of their owners whereas the farms&#x27; exceptions are indefinite. Development west of the parkway, covering two-thirds of the township&#x27;s area, is strictly controlled by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission.

Some Ocean County residents refer to all of Lacey Township as Forked River with the first word pronounced with two syllables (FOR-kid or FORK-id). Pronouncing the first word with one syllable is a sign of a non-native.

In a 2015 NJ.com poll with 91,000 respondents, Lacey Township was voted as part of South Jersey. According to the poll results, Lacey Township is South Jersey&#x27;s northernmost Jersey Shore community.

The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Lakehurst is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Lakehurst Borough is Republican Harry Robbins, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Lakehurst Borough Council are Council President Steven Oglesby (R, 2025), Jeffrey Emmons (R, 2027), Brian C. DiMeo (R, 2025), Bernadette Dugan (R, 2027; elected to serve an unexpired term), Patricia A. Hodges (R, 2026) and Robert McCarthy (R, 2026).

<text>Lakewood Township is the most populous township in Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A rapidly growing community, as of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 135,158, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 42,315 (+45.6%) from the 2010 census count of 92,843, which in turn reflected an increase of 32,491 (+53.8%) from the 60,352 counted in the 2000 census. The township ranked as the fifth-most-populous municipality in the state in 2020, after ranking seventh in 2010, and 22nd in 2000, placing the township only behind the state&#x27;s four biggest cities (Newark; Jersey City; Paterson; Elizabeth). The sharp increase in population from 2000 to 2010 was led largely by increases in the township&#x27;s Orthodox Jewish and Latino communities. Further growth in the Orthodox community led to a sharp increase in population in the 2020 census, with a large number of births leading to a significant drop in the township&#x27;s median age. The Census Bureau&#x27;s Population Estimates Program calculated that the township&#x27;s population was 139,506 in 2022, helping the fast-growing town surpass Elizabeth as the fourth-most-populous municipality in the state.

As a major hub of Orthodox Judaism, Lakewood is home to Beth Medrash Govoha, the largest yeshiva outside of Israel. The large Orthodox population, which comprises more than half the township&#x27;s population, strongly influences the township&#x27;s culture and wields considerable political clout in the township as a voting bloc.

==History==
The earliest documented European settlement of the present Lakewood area was by operators of sawmills, from about 1750 forward. One such sawmill—located at the east end of the present Lake Carasaljo—was known as Three Partners Mill from at least 1789 until at least 1814. From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-smelting operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local bog iron ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.

Lakewood&#x27;s developers thought that &quot;Bricksburg&quot; did not capture their vision for the community, and the names &quot;Brightwood&quot; and &quot;Lakewood&quot; were proposed. After reaching out to area residents, &quot;Lakewood&quot; was chosen, and the United States Postal Service approved the name in March 1880. The name &quot;Lakewood&quot; was intended to focus on the location near lakes and pine forests.

Lakewood was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1892, from portions of Brick Township. Portions of Howell Township in Monmouth County were annexed to Lakewood Township in 1929.

Lakewood&#x27;s three most prominent hotels were the Laurel House (opened in 1880; closed in 1932), the Lakewood Hotel (opened January 1891, closed in 1925), and the Laurel-in-the-Pines (opened December 1891, burned down in 1967). Lakewood&#x27;s promoters claimed that its winter temperature was usually about ten degrees warmer than that of New York City and were warmer than points located further south, but this claim is not substantiated by official records of the United States Weather Bureau. During the 1890s, Lakewood was a resort for the rich and famous, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; devoted a weekly column to the activities of Lakewood society. Grover Cleveland spent the winters of 1891–1892 and 1892–1893 in a cottage near the Lakewood Hotel, commuting to his business in New York City. This cottage became part of the Tuberculosis Preventorium for Children in 1909. Mark Twain also enjoyed vacationing in Lakewood. George Jay Gould I acquired an estate at Lakewood in 1896, which is now Georgian Court University. John D. Rockefeller bought a property in 1902 which later became Ocean County Park. Lakewood&#x27;s hotel business remained strong in the 1920s and 1950s, but went into severe decline in the 1960s.

In 1943, Aharon Kotler founded Beth Medrash Govoha (BMG). In time, it would grow to become the largest yeshiva outside of Israel. In the 1960s, much of the woods and cranberry bogs in the township were replaced by large housing developments. Leisure Village, a condominium retirement development on the south side of Route 70, opened for sale in 1963.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 25.08 square miles (64.95 km2), including 24.68 square miles (63.92 km2) of land and 0.40 square miles (1.03 km2) of water (1.59%). Lying on the coastal plain, Lakewood is a fairly flat place: three-quarters of it is above sea level, and its highest point is about .

The North Branch of the Metedeconk River forms the northern boundary and part of the eastern boundary of the township, while the South Branch runs through the township.

<text>Little Egg Harbor Township is a township situated on the Jersey Shore, within Ocean County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is the southernmost municipality in both Ocean County and the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 20,784, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 719 (+3.6%) from the 2010 census count of 20,065, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,120 (+25.8%) from the 15,945 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
===Founding===

Originally part of Burlington County, Little Egg Harbor took its name from the portion of a bay called Egg Harbor (known today as Little Egg Harbor) by the Dutch sailors because of the eggs found in nearby gull nests. The first known account of the town was made by Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May in 1614.

The first European to settle the township was Hendrick Jacobs Falkenberg, who likely arrived by 1693 when he does not appear on a census of the Swedes along the Delaware River, where he had lived for nearly three decades. Though he was from Holstein (now in Germany), his first wife was a Finn and part of the Swedish community. Falkenberg settled on an tract of land that he had acquired from the Lenni Lenape Native Americans in 1674, and a 1697 deed re-confirmed this earlier purchase. This tract included the two islands of Monhunk and Minnicunk later known as Osborn Island and Wills Island. Falkenberg was a linguist, fluent in the Lenape language, and was considered southern New Jersey&#x27;s foremost language interpreter involving land transactions between the Indians and the European settlers, particularly the English Quakers.
The Little Egg Harbor Massacre took place in October 1778 during the American Revolutionary War, as British Army Major Patrick Ferguson was wreaking havoc on Colonial shipping in the Mullica River. Kazimierz Pułaski and his newly raised forces were ordered to oppose his actions. Pulaski&#x27;s Legion, along with three companies of light infantry, three troops of light horse, and one artillery detachment, came too late to be of great use against Ferguson&#x27;s operations. But their arrival did stop Ferguson from raiding the iron works at Batsto, and stemmed their attacks on privateers at The Forks of the Mullica River.

They then set up camp on a farm. A deserter, Lt. Gustav Juliet, found Ferguson and told him of Pulaski&#x27;s encampment; he mentioned that morale was fairly low, and security almost nonexistent, so that a surprise attack would be devastating. Ferguson promptly loaded 250 of his best men onto boats and rowed them, in the dark, some to Osborne Island. He then marched them a further to the site of the infantry outpost, which comprised 50 men a short distance from the main encampment. At first light, Ferguson ordered the attack; only five of his quarry were taken alive. Pulaski eventually led his mounted troops up, causing Ferguson to retreat to his boats minus a few men that had fallen into the colonists&#x27; hands. A memorial on Radio Road commemorates the attack.

Little Egg Harbor Township was formed on February 13, 1740, as Egg Harbour Township from portions of Northampton Township (now Mount Holly), while the area was still part of Burlington County. It was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s 104 in the Township Act of 1798 by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. While in Burlington County, portions of the township were taken to form Washington Township (November 19, 1802) and Bass River Township (March 30, 1864). Little Egg Harbor Township became part of Ocean County on March 30, 1891, after which further portions of the township were ceded to create Long Beach Township (March 23, 1899) and Tuckerton (February 18, 1901).

===Tuckerton Wireless Tower===

The Tuckerton Wireless Tower (), at in height, was built in 1912 by the German &quot;Hochfrequenzmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft Für Drahtlose Telegraphie&quot; company (The High Frequency Machine Corporation for Wireless Telegraphy, often referred to as HOMAG) when the present-day Mystic Island was called Hickory Island. The tower was used to communicate with an identical radio telegraph station in Eilvese, Germany starting on Jun 19, 1914, less than two weeks before the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The station continued to communicate with Eilvese until America entered World War I on . It is rumored that it was used to send the message to order the attack by a German U-boat on the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. After President Wilson&#x27;s Declaration of Neutrality, the President&#x27;s Executive Order 2042 required the US Navy to take over the station on September 9, 1914, to assure the neutrality of messages sent to and from the station. However, the station continued to be operated by German nationals employed by HOMAG and continued to communicate only with the Eilvese radio station.

When America entered the war, all U.S. radio stations were seized and shut down by Executive Order 2605A on April 30, 1917. The remaining German personnel at Tuckerton immediately became war prisoners and were replaced by U.S. Navy personnel. The Navy used the Tuckerton Radio Station for transatlantic communications while the naval radio stations in New Brunswick, New Jersey and Sayville, New York were undergoing major transmitter and antenna upgrades. Tuckerton was used for fleet broadcasts after installations of 200 kilowatt transmitters at New Brunswick and Sayville were completed in June 1918.

After the war, the Tuckerton Wireless Station was included in German war reparations paid to America. Shortly afterwards, it was sold to RCA which operated it until 1948 as a backup to their famous Radio Central facility in Rocky Point, New York. In 1921, RCA installed two massive Alexanderson alternators, which were removed in 1948. For transatlantic communications, the radio station operated under the call signs WCI and WGG. For coastal communications, after World War I, the station operated under the callsign WSC. The steel tower, anchored by three large concrete blocks, was taken down on December 27, 1955. The three huge anchor blocks still exist today, in a backyard on North Ensign Drive and in the middle of South Ensign Drive and Staysail Drive. Many smaller anchor blocks providing foundations for smaller towers that supported the umbrella antenna are still visible in the lagoons. Remains of the large tower can be seen in scraps at the Giffordtown Museum.

===Later history===
While the township was formed in the 1700s, Little Egg Harbor remained predominantly rural and undeveloped well into the late 20th century. It wasn&#x27;t until the late 1950s until any major development was started. During this time, the construction of manufactured waterfront bungalows on lagoons were built and marketed as vacation properties, most notably Mystic Islands, Holly Lake Harbor, as well as Atlantis; the latter of which a &quot;research home&quot; was constructed to test hundreds of components and finishing materials for possible inclusion in model homes. Most of the population were seasonal residents from either New York, Philadelphia, or other parts of New Jersey. Several developments were constructed in the decades following around the Mystic Islands area, mostly consisting of townhomes, duplex, and small single-family homes meant to act as either vacation homes or year-round residence.

In 1979, Pinelands Regional High School opened in the growing township, serving students from Little Egg Harbor, Tuckerton, Bass River, and Eagleswood; those students formerly went to Southern Regional High School in Manahawkin.

By the 2000s, the township was one of the fastest-growing in Ocean County, next to Barnegat. The formerly sleepy township saw the development of several new housing developments, shopping centers, and offices. While 75% of the growth came from new retirement communities, the former resort town dubbed &quot;Little Treasure on the Bay&quot; saw an influx of year-round residents and families, becoming more of a suburb.

On November 3, 2004, a fighter jet on a training mission from the 113th Wing of the District of Columbia Air National Guard, based at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, shot seven bullets into the roof of the Little Egg Harbor Intermediate School, and many others into the parking lot. Only a few custodians were in the school, and nobody was injured. The plane had been on a training mission at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range, a area about from the school. The school was repaired during the New Jersey Teachers&#x27; Convention, using $519,000 paid by the Air Force to the school district.

On the morning of August 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene made its second U.S. landfall in Brigantine, though initial reports placed it at the Little Egg Inlet on the border with Galloway Township. At the time it was believed to be the first hurricane to make landfall in New Jersey since 1903, but later analysis by the National Hurricane Center determined that the storm had weakened to tropical storm status by the time it made its second landfall. On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused widespread damage and flooding to the township, damaging roughly 4,000 homes, especially in the Mystic Island section. On the one-year anniversary of the storm, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie visited the township&#x27;s Community Center to celebrate both the reopening of the storm-damaged building as well as the recovery efforts from the storm.
