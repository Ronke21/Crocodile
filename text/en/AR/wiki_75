When the town was incorporated in 1759 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, it was given the name &quot;Pembroke&quot; in honor of Henry Herbert, ninth Earl of Pembroke in southern Wales.

Pembroke&#x27;s early history is reflected in the various mills of the downtown area, located to use water power from the Suncook River. The better-known mills were the Pembroke Mills, Webster Manufacturing, and China Manufacturing, all producing print cloth. Pembroke industries included brickmaking, with bricks manufactured from clay along the Merrimack River. In 1852, the Concord and Portsmouth Railroad established a station in Pembroke.

== Pembroke Town Library ==
The first lending library in Pembroke was not a tax-supported public library in the modern sense. It was a proprietary library of the type seen throughout New England in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Incorporated on December 7, 1798, as the Proprietors of the Pembroke Library, this organization purchased its books through &quot;assessments&quot; or taxes levied each year on its shareholders, who were the only people permitted to borrow its books.

The Pembroke Town Library, the town&#x27;s first tax-supported public library, was born when the New Hampshire legislature passed some of the nation&#x27;s most progressive library laws in the 1890s. An innovative law of 1891 required the state to assist towns that voted to establish a tax-supported, free public library. To get the local library established, the state gave such towns $100 worth of books and professional guidance in librarianship. In 1895, the legislature passed a law, the first of its kind in the nation, &quot;requiring&quot; each town to appropriate funds to establish a public library and to appoint a board of library trustees unless the electorate voted each year specifically not to do so.

The law of 1895 spurred the founding of the Pembroke Town Library in 1896. New town libraries of the period were often housed in any available room, and Pembroke&#x27;s library was no exception. After a series of locations, the library planning for a proper library building resumed in June 1997. The building was dedicated on June 14, 2003.

Sutton includes the villages of Sutton Mills (shown as &quot;Sutton&quot; on topographic maps), North Sutton, South Sutton and East Sutton. North Sutton is home to Wadleigh State Park on Kezar Lake.

==History==
The town was granted in 1749 by the Masonian Proprietors to inhabitants of Haverhill, Newbury, and Bradford, Massachusetts, as well as Kingston, New Hampshire. It was called &quot;Perrystown&quot; after Obadiah Perry, one of the proprietors. But the French and Indian War delayed settlement until 1767, when David Peaslee arrived. Many proprietors forfeited their claims, even with an extension in 1773, so the town was regranted in 1784. The second group of settlers were from Sutton, Massachusetts, source of the town&#x27;s current name.

In 1981, the world’s first paintball facility was opened in Sutton. The facilities were operated by Bob Gurnsey, one of the inventors of paintballing. The facility closed in 1985.

<text>Warner is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,937 at the 2020 census. The town is home to Rollins State Park and Mount Kearsarge State Forest.

The town&#x27;s central village, where 453 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Warner census-designated place (CDP) and is located along New Hampshire Route 103 and the Warner River. The town also includes the communities of Davisville, Lower Village, Melvin Mills, and Waterloo.

==History==
The town was granted in 1735 as &quot;Number One&quot; by Massachusetts Governor Jonathan Belcher to petitioners largely from Amesbury, Massachusetts. Called &quot;New Amesbury&quot;, it was part of a line of settlements running between the Merrimack and Connecticut rivers intended to help defend Massachusetts against New France&#x27;s predations. It was regranted by the Masonian Proprietors in 1749, when it was settled with four houses and a sawmill. Called &quot;Jennesstown&quot;, it was abandoned and destroyed during the French and Indian War. The town was granted again in 1767 to Jonathan Barnard and others, who called it &quot;Amesbury&quot;. But on September 3, 1774, it was incorporated as &quot;Warner&quot;, named after Jonathan Warner, a leading Portsmouth citizen, namesake of the Warner House and relative of Governor John Wentworth. It was one of the last towns established under English provincial rule prior to the Revolution.

Warner developed into a prosperous farming community which produced meats, dairy goods, vegetables, hay and apples. The Warner River and its tributaries provided water power for mills, which in 1832 included twelve sawmills, six gristmills, a paper mill and two clothing factories. By 1858, there was also a cabinet manufacturer and bottle manufacturer. In 1885, industries included a bedstead factory, chain factory, woolen cloth factory, iron foundry, tannery, and glove manufacturer. On September 9, 1821, the town was hit by a tornado. It leveled houses and forests in a swath of destruction beginning west of Lake Sunapee, through New London and Sutton, over the southwest spur of Mount Kearsarge and ending at the Webster line. The storm killed four people in Warner, seriously injured others and destroyed considerable property.

Each October, on Columbus Day weekend, Warner hosts the annual Fall Foliage Festival, attracting thousands of people from all over New England and beyond.

==Geography==
The town is in central New Hampshire, in the western part of Merrimack County. It is by road northwest of Concord, the state capital, and southeast of the Vermont border at West Lebanon.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town of Warner has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.45% of the town. The majority of Warner is drained by the Warner River, which flows past the center of town. Two covered bridges span the river: the Dalton Bridge and the Waterloo Bridge. The southwestern section of town is drained by Amey Brook and its tributary, Warner Brook, and the northernmost end of town, on the slopes of Mount Kearsarge, drains both east and west to the Blackwater River. The Warner River, Blackwater River, and Amey Brook are all tributaries of the Contoocook River, part of the Merrimack River watershed.

Mount Kearsarge, elevation above sea level, located in the extreme north of the town, is the highest point in Warner and in Merrimack County. Two state parks are located on the mountain: Rollins State Park in Warner and Winslow State Park in Wilmot. Mount Kearsarge is a popular hiking destination, due both to its bare, rocky summit, and to the fact that a paved road climbs from Rollins State Park to within a half mile of the summit. The peak is the highest point along the Sunapee-Ragged-Kearsarge Greenway, a hiking trail which links ten towns and encircles the Lake Sunapee region of western New Hampshire.

The town is served by Interstate 89 and New Hampshire Route 103. State routes 114 and 127 cross the extreme southwestern and southeastern corners of the town, respectively.

<text>Malmstrom Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base in Cascade County, Montana, United States, adjacent to the city of Great Falls. It was named in honor of World War II POW Colonel Einar Axel Malmstrom. It is the home of the 341st Missile Wing (341 MW) of the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Malmstrom Air Force Base as a census-designated place (CDP). It had a population of 3,472 at the 2010 census.

==History==

===World War II===
Malmstrom Air Force Base traces its beginnings back to 1939 when World War II broke out in Europe. Concern about the war caused the local Chamber of Commerce to contact two Montana senators, Burton K. Wheeler and James E. Murray and request they consider development of a military installation in Great Falls. In addition, appeals were made to the Secretary of War, Harry H. Woodring. In 1941, the Civil Aeronautics Authority provided the money for the development of the Great Falls Municipal Airport. In May 1942, construction began on an Army Air Corps base six miles (10 km) east of Great Falls. The base was known as East Base.

In November 1942, a survey team evaluated an area near the Green Mill Dance Club and Rainbow Dam Road approximately east of Great Falls. Great Falls, along with ten other northern tier sparsely populated sites, was considered for a heavy bomber training base. Construction began on Great Falls Army Air Base (AAB) on 8 June 1942. The base was informally known as East Base since the 7th Ferrying Group was stationed at Great Falls Municipal Airport on Gore Hill (known as Gore Field during its military use). Its mission was to establish an air route between Great Falls and Ladd Field, Fairbanks, Alaska, as part of the United States Lend-Lease Program that supplied the Soviet Union with aircraft and supplies needed to fight the German Army.Great Falls AAB was assigned to II Bomber Command, Second Air Force. Its initial base operating unit was the 352d Base HQ and Air Base Squadron. Airfield operations began on 30 November 1942 when the first B-17 Flying Fortress landed at the new base. Four Bombardment Groups, the 2nd, 385th, 390th, and 401st, trained at Great Falls AAB from November 1942 to October 1943 under Army Air Force Training Command. Group Headquarters and one of the Groups&#x27; four squadrons were stationed in Great Falls with the other squadrons stationed on sub-bases at Cut Bank, Glasgow, and Lewistown, Montana. Aircraft would take off at a predetermined time, form up in squadron formation over their respective location, and later, over central Montana, join up in group formation. These bombardment groups went on to participate in decisive raids over Germany as part of Eighth Air Force opening the door for Allied daylight precision bombing.

Upon completion of the B-17 training program, in October 1943, Great Falls Army Air Base was transferred to the Air Transport Command (ATC) and units from Gore Field were transferred to the base. The base was considerably expanded when more buildings were constructed, including a consolidated mess, a post exchange, a theater, and a 400-bed hospital. Air Transport Command also established aerial port facilities for passengers and cargo, as well as a flight service center. The ATC 90th Ferrying Squadron (7th Ferrying Group) was assigned to the base which performed operations in support of the Lend Lease Program with the Soviet Union.

At Great Falls, P-39 Airacobras, C-47 Skytrains, B-25 Mitchells, and A-20 Havocs aircraft arrived by rail and were assembled on base, along with others that were flown in by both military and Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs). These aircraft were later flown by U.S. pilots by way of the Northwest Staging Route through Canada, to Fairbanks, Alaska, and transferred to Soviet pilots who in turn flew them into Siberia via the Alaskan-Siberian Route (ALSIB). A total of of cargo containing aircraft parts, tools miscellaneous equipment, explosives and medical supplies were shipped through Great Falls Army Air Base to the Soviet Union.

This included one of the greatest technology transfers (and espionage operations) in the history of the world. According to Richard Rhodes the plans for the atomic bomb, hundreds of tons of nuclear weapons materials, strategic intelligence reports, and the plans for much of the most advanced aviation, electronic, and heavy industrial technology was transferred through Gore Field and East Base in sealed diplomatic containers. Dozens, if not hundreds, of Soviet agents also entered the U.S. through Great Falls as part of the Soviet Lend-lease delegation and staff.

Aircraft shipments to the Soviet Union stopped in September 1945, when World War II ended, with approximately 8,000 aircraft having been processed in a 21-month period.

Following World War II, Great Falls Army Air Base (later Great Falls Air Force Base and Malmstrom Air Force Base) played an important role in US defense during the Cold War era (1948–1991). The base was assigned or attached to several major commands, and its assigned units performed a wide variety of missions.

===Military Air Transport Service===
After World War II ended Great Falls AAB assumed a support mission for military personnel assigned to Alaskan military installations. A reserve training unit was established by the Continental Air Forces Fourth Air Force under the 418th Army Air Force Base Unit on 10 October 1946. In September 1947, the United States Air Force became a separate service and the base&#x27;s name was changed to Great Falls Air Force Base.

Tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union increased dramatically when the Soviet Union closed all land travel between the western occupation sectors of Germany and the American, French and British sectors of Berlin. The Western allies decided to try to supply Berlin by air. On 25 June 1948 &quot;Operation Vittles,&quot; the strategic airlift of supplies to Berlin&#x27;s 2,000,000 inhabitants, was initiated, beginning what became known as the Berlin Airlift. Great Falls AFB played a critical role in assuring the success of this vital operation. Officials selected the base as the only replacement aircrew training site for Berlin Airlift-bound C-54 Skymasters, reinforcing the United States Air Forces in Europe. Thus the 517th Air Transport Wing was activated. Using radio beacons, Great Falls AFB was transformed to resemble Tempelhof Airport in Berlin, Germany. Hundreds of pilots and flight engineers, many of whom were recalled to active duty, were qualified on the C-54 aircraft and on flight procedures to and from Berlin by practicing on ground mock-ups and flying simulated airlift missions.

Later, the 517th Air Transport Wing was redesignated the 1701st Air Transport Wing on 1 June 1948 when Air Transport Command was redesignated the Military Air Transport Service (MATS). Great Falls was assigned to the MATS Pacific Division. Transport units assigned to Great Falls were the 5th, 6th and 7th Air Transport Squadrons (later redesignated 1270th, 1271st and 1272d ATS) which flew C-54 Skymasters.

MATS reopened the C-54 Flight Training School as the 1272 Medium Transition Training Unit (Squadron) in May 1950, one month before the Korean War began. The unit&#x27;s primary mission was the routing and scheduling of flights throughout the Pacific Ocean region and in support of Allied forces in the conflict. The 1701st ATW was later replaced by the 1300th Air Base Wing.

Great Falls became the temporary home of the 582nd Air Resupply and Communications Wing on 1 May 1953 which was transferred from Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. The 582d was a special operations unit which focused on PSYWAR missions. It deployed from Great Falls to RAF Molesworth, United Kingdom (UK), and set up operations as part of USAFE&#x27;s Third Air Force in February 1954.

===Malmstrom===
Originally named Great Falls Army Air Base, later Great Falls Air Force Base, the facility was renamed Malmstrom Air Force Base on 1 October 1955 in honor of Colonel Einar Axel Malmstrom (1907–1954). Shot down on his 58th combat fighter mission in World War II, Malmstrom became the US commander of Luftwaffe Stalag Luft I South Compound, a prisoner-of-war camp at Barth, Germany. After his release and return to active Air Force service, he died in the crash of a T-33 Shooting Star trainer on 21 August 1954 near Great Falls Air Force Base. In the short period of his tenure as vice wing commander, Colonel Malmstrom endeared himself to the local community. Saddened by the loss, the people of Great Falls began a drive to rename the base after him.

===Air Defense Command===
Great Falls (later Malmstrom AFB) played a major aerial defense role in North American air defense mission. Although the base was not assigned to Air Defense Command, the attached 29th Air Division was activated at Great Falls AFB in early 1950, bringing with them command and control authority of fighter interceptor squadrons, an aircraft control and warning squadron, and ground observer detachments in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, and parts of Nevada, Utah, and Colorado as part of the Air Defense Command Western Air Defense Force. The 29th Fighter Interceptor Squadron was activated in 1953 and remained at Malmstrom until 1968, initially flying F-94C Starfire and later F-101 Voodoo interceptors. Great Falls was reassigned to the Central Air Defense Force at Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base in 1953. The 29th Air Division&#x27;s area of responsibility changed to include Montana, North and South Dakota and Nebraska. The 29th supervised the training of its units, and participated in numerous training exercises. On 1 July 1961, the 29th AD was relocated to Richards Gebaur AFB, Missouri.

By 1954, several aircraft control and warning (radar) squadrons had been formed at the base. The 903d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was one of them, and operated an AN/TPS-1D (termed a &quot;gap-filler&quot;). This radar was used probably for training purposes. The 903rd AC&amp;W Squadron subsequently relocated to Gettysburg AFS, South Dakota.

In 1957, under the control of the 801st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, the Malmstrom AFB radar station became operational with AN/FPS-20 search and AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars. A second AN/FPS-6 series height-finder radar was added in 1960, and subsequently was upgraded to an AN/FPS-90 set. In 1959 Malmstrom was performing air-traffic-control duties for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system on 1 March 1961, the squadron being redesignated as the 801st Radar Squadron (SAGE). In 1964 Malmstrom received an AN/FPS-24 search radar, replacing the AN/FPS-20.

The 801st Radar Squadron was inactivated on 31 December 1969 due to budget reductions. However, the radar site itself rejoined the SAGE network on 30 June 1971. The FAA operated an AN/FPS-65 search radar (which had replaced the AN/FPS-24), and the Air Force added an AN/FPS-90 height-finder radar. This height-finder radar later became an AN/FPS-116 for the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) Program, then was removed 1988. The Malmstrom AFB radar site was closed altogether in 1996, and after the air force shut down the ADCOM Z-147 site, the FAA took over operation as part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS).

Z-147 was completely replaced by a new ARSR-4 JSS site on Bootlegger Ridge, about 14 miles northeast of Great Falls AFB. Designated by NORAD as Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Ground Equipment Facility J-77A.

In 1959 a SAGE data center (DC-20) was established at Malmstrom. The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) general surveillance radar stations into a centralized center for air defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack.

DC-20 was initially under the Great Falls Air Defense Sector (GFADS), established on 1 March 1959. GFADS was inactivated on 1 April 1966, and re designated as the 28th Air Division. DC-20 with its AN/FSQ-7 computer remained under the 28th AD until it was inactivated on 19 November 1969 and being taken over by the 24th Air Division. DC-20 remained on duty until March 1983 when technology advances allowed the air force to shut down many SAGE data centers.

The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was created in 1957. Beginning in 1959, Malmstrom was the headquarters of the Great Falls Air Defense Sector, until inactivated in 1966. In 1978, Malmstrom AFB became responsible for the 24th NORAD region, which covered the western half of the North America. This comprised four fighter/interceptor squadrons and radar sites stretching from the Rocky Mountains, halfway across North Dakota and north to the north border of Canada. The 24th also served as the NORAD alternate command post, which remained active until 1983, when it was inactivated and replaced by the Northwest Air Defense Sector.

On 1 July 1968, the F-101B equipped 29th FIS was inactivated and replaced by the F-106 Delta Dart equipped 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was reassigned from Richards Gebaur AFB when its ADC mission was eliminated. Three years later, the 71st was redesignated as the 319th FIS, which remained on alert until 30 June 1972 when the active-duty air defense interceptor mission at Malmstrom was inactivated.

===Strategic Air Command===
On 18 December 1953, Great Falls AFB was transferred from Military Air Transport Service to Strategic Air Command (SAC), although MATS units remained at the base for several years. SAC activated the 407th Strategic Fighter Wing at Great Falls with a mission to provide fighter escort for SAC&#x27;s long-range B-36 Peacemaker The 407th SFW was assigned to Fifteenth Air Force, 39th Air Division and flew F-84 Thunderjets.

On 21 August 1954 the 407th SFW Vice Commander, Colonel Einar Axel Malmstrom, died when his T-33 Shooting Star trainer crashed approximately one mile west of the Great Falls Municipal Airport. Although his tenure was short, he was well liked by the local community. It was the local civilian community that led the efforts to rename Great Falls AFB for Col. Malmstrom. On 15 June 1956, the base was officially dedicated as Malmstrom Air Force Base.With the phaseout of the B-36 from the inventory in the late 1950s, the need for fighter escorts of SAC bombers was eliminated. The new B-52 Stratofortress and B-47 Stratojet bombers flew higher and faster than the F-84 escort fighters and instead of flying in formations, SAC&#x27;s bombers flew individually to their selected targets. The 407th SFW was inactivated in 1957 and replaced by the 4061st Air Refueling Wing (ARW) was activated, initially equipped with the KB-29J, a Superfortress variant re-engineered to provide aerial refueling capabilities. The 407th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS) were joined by the 97th ARS and their KC-97 Stratofreighters to form the wing. The 4061st ARW flew their missions from Malmstrom AFB until July 1961.

====341st Strategic Missile Wing====
With the development of the three-stage, solid-fuel Minuteman I missile in the late 1950s SAC began searching for sites to deploy this revolutionary weapon. Because Malmstrom&#x27;s location placed most strategic targets in the Soviet Union within range of Minuteman, the base was selected to become a command and control center for ICBMs located in central Montana.

On 23 December 1959, the Air Force Ballistic Missile Committee approved the selection of Malmstrom AFB to host the first Minuteman ICBM base. A change of mission for the base occurred on 15 July 1961 when the 341st Strategic Missile Wing was reassigned to Malmstrom. The 341st was previously assigned to Dyess AFB, Texas, where it was designated as the 341st Bombardment Wing. With the reassignment of the 341st SMW to Malmstrom, the tankers of the 407th ARW were reassigned or retired and the runway at the base was used by the Air Defense Command F-101 and F-106 interceptors along with transient aircraft.

Construction of the wing&#x27;s first launch facility began in March 1961 and was completed in December. The 10th Strategic Missile Squadron (SMS) was activated on 1 November 1961 and Alpha-01, the first launch control facility, was completed in July 1962. The first Minuteman I ICBM arrived on base by rail 23 July 1962. Just four days after the missile&#x27;s arrival, Launch Facility Alpha-09 gained the title of the first Minuteman missile site. The 12th SMS and 490th SMS activated in March and May 1962.

On 3 July 1963, following 28 months of construction, the wing and its three squadrons became operational. Each squadron controlled 50 missiles, bringing the total wing strength to 150 Minuteman I missiles. Two years later, construction began on the fourth and final squadron, the 564th SMS. This squadron was equipped with the more modern Minuteman II missiles. On 5 May 1967, the 564th SMS was declared fully operational. Malmstrom&#x27;s missile field was now the largest in the United States, covering . Two years later, the 10th, 12th and 490th SMSs were also upgraded to the Minuteman II missiles, increasing the wing&#x27;s capabilities to four missile squadrons equipped with a total of 200 Minuteman II missiles.

In late 1962 missiles assigned to the 341st Wing would play a major role in the Cuban Missile Crisis. On 26 October, at 11:16 am, the 10th SMS&#x27;s launch facility Alpha-06 went on &quot;strategic alert&quot; after it was discovered the Soviet Union had placed nuclear missiles in Cuba to counter the threat to Moscow and most of the Soviet Union east of the Urals posed by American nuclear-armed Jupiter and Thor missiles based in Turkey.
Over the next four days the wing placed four more missiles on alert, with the last missile from Alpha Flight achieving alert status on 10 November. The Soviets eventually removed their missiles from Cuba.

In fact, the Minuteman missiles at Malmstrom were able to substitute for Jupiter and Thor missiles based in Turkey, which were removed under a secret accord, thus allowing the Soviets to remove their missiles from Cuba, and replace them with submarine-based missiles and longer-range ICBMs based on Soviet territory. The overall effect of the Cuban Missile Crisis was to greatly expand and extend the nuclear arms race, in which Malmstrom played (and continues to play) a leading role.

Throughout the Cold War era, the wing&#x27;s missiles remained on alert and underwent extensive weapons systems upgrades. The 17th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron, equipped with EB-57 Canberras, was activated in the 1970s to train NORAD air defense personnel in electronic countermeasures. In 1988 the hardened mobile launcher for the small ICBM was tested at Malmstrom AFB to verify its ability to operate in harsh winter conditions.

====301st Air Refueling Wing====
On 5 January 1988, Malmstrom gained its first SAC flying wing since the 4061st Air Refueling Wing had been inactivated in 1961. SAC&#x27;s 301st Air Refueling Wing arrived from Rickenbacker AFB, Ohio and was responsible for the operation of KC-135R Stratotankers, refueling fighter, bomber, airlift, special operations and strategic reconnaissance aircraft worldwide.

A major restructuring occurred in 1989 when SAC relocated the 40th Air Division to Malmstrom AFB and assigned it host responsibilities for both the newly activated 301st ARW and the 341st Strategic Missile Wing.

The 301st ARW deployed to Moon Island in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm. During this time period the 301st flew 443 Combat Sorties refueling 936 coalition aircraft, and transferring 33.5 Million pounds of fuel. The 341st Strategic Missile Wing deployed security, civil engineering, services and support personnel in support of the action. On 14 June 1991, the 40th Air Division inactivated, returning host responsibilities back to the 341st SMW with the 301st ARW remaining as a tenant unit.

===Post-Cold War era===
The 40th Air Division was activated at Malmstrom on 7 July 1989. A third of the base&#x27;s personnel (about 1,800 people) were assigned to it, including support personnel from the 341st Strategic Missile Wing. Historian, judge advocate, public affairs, and safety were now designated 40th Air Division, while combat support, resource management, security police, and strategic clinic were redesignated 840th.

On 1 September 1991, the 341 SMW became the 341st Missile Wing. Also in 1991, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), was officially formalized. President Bush took all Minuteman II missiles, bombers and tankers off alert status on 27 September. In November 1991, the 12th Missile Squadron&#x27;s Launch Facility J-03 became the first to have its missile removed in compliance with the order. It would be three and one half years, until the last Minuteman II in the Air Force inventory was removed from Kilo-11 on 10 August 1995. As Minuteman II missiles were removed, a new program called Rivet Add was launched, modifying the 150 Minuteman II launch facilities to accommodate the newer Minuteman III, transferred from Grand Forks AFB in northeastern North Dakota.

With the inactivation of SAC on 1 June 1992, Malmstrom temporarily became an Air Mobility Command (AMC) base with the 341st Missile Wing as an Air Combat Command (ACC) tenant unit.

The 301 ARW was subsequently inactivated and replaced by the 43d Air Refueling Wing (43 ARW) as a KC-135R unit reporting to Fifteenth Air Force (15 AF), then located at March AFB, California. The 341 SMW was redesignated as the 341st Missile Wing (341 MW), reporting to ACC&#x27;s Twentieth Air Force (20 AF) located at F.E. Warren Air Force Base at Cheyenne, Wyoming. Following an Air Force decision to divest ACC of all ICBM units and assets, the 341 MW was subsequently transferred to Air Force Space Command located at Peterson Air Force Base at Colorado Springs, Colorado. This mid-1993 move merged all missile and space operations under one command. In October 1997, the 341 MW, along with all other missile wings, was redesignated as the 341st Space Wing (341 SW).

In 1994, the 43 ARW was downgraded in status and redesignated as the 43d Air Refueling Group (43 ARG). In 1996, the 43 ARG and its KC-135R aircraft were transferred from Malmstrom to MacDill AFB at Tampa, Florida, as part of a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action, merging with MacDill&#x27;s 6th Air Base Wing to form the current 6th Air Refueling Wing. With the loss of its only fixed-wing flying unit, Malmstrom&#x27;s runway was decommissioned as a cost-savings measure following departure of the last KC-135R aircraft in 1997. Malmstrom&#x27;s air traffic control tower was leveled, the navigational aids were turned off and runway was closed and currently remains inactive. One hangar and a portion of the Malmstrom flight line remain operational for aviation purposes as heliport for Malmstrom&#x27;s 40th Helicopter Squadron (40 HS) and its UH-1N Twin Huey helicopters supporting the 341st Space Wing&#x27;s Minuteman III ICBM sites.

On 18 May 2007 there was an incident involving the visiting Canadian Forces aerial demonstration squadron, the &quot;Snowbirds&quot;. While practicing, a lap belt failed in one of the Snowbirds&#x27; aircraft, resulting in a mishap that killed the pilot of Snowbird 2.

Malmstrom had been used for the site of an experimental coal to synthetic fuel plant for potential use in USAF aircraft in 2008.

On 6 May 2008, &quot;NBC Today Show&quot; personality Al Roker broadcast live from Malmstrom AFB as part of an &quot;Access Granted&quot; series centered on places the American public doesn&#x27;t get to see firsthand. Roker and his crew were permitted access to a missile silo and he interviewed various squadron members about the policies and procedures should a nuclear response ever be directed by the President of the United States.

On 1 July 2008, the 341st Space Wing was redesignated as the 341st Missile Wing.

Two launch facilities at the base showed PCB levels higher than the thresholds recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency when extensive sampling began of active U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile bases to address specific cancer concerns in 2023.

===2014 cheating scandal===

In 2014, dozens of missile launch officers lost their launch certifications after it was discovered that several officers were trading proficiency test answers amongst each other through text messages. An investigation began in 2013, when evidence of cheating was discovered during a drug investigation involving three launch officers. This resulted in over 90 nuclear launch officers being suspended from their duties and at least nine senior officers around the base were removed from command with a tenth resigning. Though some of the ten officers were not involved in the scandal, Deborah Lee James, the Secretary of the Air Force at the time, stated that they were removed for &quot;not providing proper oversight amongst their crew force&quot;. Additional investigations were conducted at Minot Air Force Base and F. E. Warren Air Force Base to determine if the scandal had spread to other bases. No evidence of cheating was discovered at either base.

== History ==
Incorporated in 1807 from part of New London, the Kearsarge gore, and a small piece of New Chester (later renamed Hill), the town took its name from Dr. James Wilmot, an English clergyman who had spoken out against England&#x27;s treatment of the American colonies. Dr. Wilmot was rector at Barton-on-the-Heath in Warwickshire, England.

==Geography==
Wilmot is in northwestern Merrimack County, in the Dartmouth–Lake Sunapee Region of New Hampshire. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.70%, are water. Wilmot is drained by Cascade Brook (two branches), Kimpton Brook, and Frazier Brook, all of which flow to the Blackwater River in neighboring Andover. The entire town is part of the Merrimack River watershed. Wilmot is dotted with several large ponds, including Eagle, Butterfield, Piper, White, Tannery, and Chase ponds. The Sunapee–Ragged–Kearsarge (SRK) Greenway traverses the town, crossing Bog Mountain in the northern part of town and climbing Mount Kearsarge in the south.

The village of Wilmot is near the center of the town, along New Hampshire Route 4A. Wilmot Flat is a village in the southern part of the town, served by New Hampshire Route 11. North Wilmot is a rural community centered on the junction of North Wilmot Road and Breezy Hill Road, north of White Pond.

Mount Kearsarge, elevation above sea level, on the southern border, is the highest point in town and in Merrimack County.

<text>Gothic rock (also called goth rock or simply goth) is a style of rock music that emerged from post-punk in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The first post-punk bands which shifted toward dark music with gothic overtones include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus, and the Cure.

The genre itself was defined as a separate movement from post-punk. Gothic rock stood out due to its darker sound, with the use of primarily minor or bass chords, reverb, dark arrangements, or dramatic and melancholic melodies, having inspirations in gothic literature allied with themes such as sadness, nihilism, dark romanticism, tragedy, melancholy and morbidity. These themes are often approached poetically. The sensibilities of the genre led the lyrics to represent the evil of the century and the romantic idealization of death and the supernatural imagination. Gothic rock then gave rise to a broader goth subculture that included clubs, fashion and publications in the 1980s, 1990s, and into the 21st century.

== Characteristics ==
According to music journalist Simon Reynolds, standard musical fixtures of gothic rock include &quot;scything guitar patterns, high-pitched basslines that often usurped the melodic role [and] beats that were either hypnotically dirgelike or tom-tom heavy and &#x27;tribal. Reynolds described the vocal style as consisting of &quot;deep, droning alloys of Jim Morrison and Leonard Cohen&quot;. Several acts used drum machines downplaying the rhythm&#x27;s backbeat.

Gothic rock typically deals with dark themes addressed through lyrics and the music&#x27;s atmosphere. The poetic sensibilities of the genre led gothic rock lyrics to exhibit literary romanticism, morbidity, existentialism, religious symbolism, or supernatural mysticism. Gothic rock is an offshoot of post-punk and, according to AllMusic, &quot;took the cold synthesizers and processed guitars of post-punk and used them to construct foreboding, sorrowful, often epic soundscapes.&quot; Early gothic rock had introspective or personal lyrics, but according to AllMusic, &quot;its poetic sensibilities soon led to a taste for literary romanticism, morbidity, religious symbolism, and/or supernatural mysticism.&quot;

== History ==
=== Forerunners (1960s and 1970s) ===
Critic John Stickney used the term &quot;gothic rock&quot; to describe the music of the Doors in October 1967, in a review published in &quot;The Williams Record&quot;. Stickney wrote that the band met the journalists &quot;in the gloomy vaulted wine cellar of the Delmonico hotel, the perfect room to honor the gothic rock of the Doors&quot;. The author noted that contrary to the &quot;pleasant, amusing hippies&quot;, there was &quot;violence&quot; in their music and a dark atmosphere on stage during their concerts. Stickney ultimately titled his article, &quot;Four Doors to the Future: Gothic Rock Is Their Thing&quot;. 

Musicians who initially shaped the aesthetics and musical conventions of gothic rock include Marc Bolan, the Velvet Underground, the Doors, David Bowie, Brian Eno, and Iggy Pop. Journalist Kurt Loder would write that the song &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot; by the Velvet Underground is a &quot;mesmerizing gothic-rock masterpiece&quot;. However, Reynolds considers Alice Cooper as &quot;the true ungodly godfather of goth&quot; due to his &quot;theatrics and black humor&quot;. Nico&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;The Marble Index&quot; is sometimes described as &quot;the first truly gothic album&quot;. With its stark sound, somber lyrics, and Nico&#x27;s deliberate change in her look, the album became a crucial music and visual prototype for the gothic rock movement. Gothic rock creates a dark atmosphere by drawing influence from the drones used by protopunk group the Velvet Underground, and many gothic singers are influenced by the &quot;deep and dramatic&quot; vocal timbre of David Bowie, albeit singing at even lower pitches. Although gothic rock is an offshoot of post-punk, glam rock is another forerunner genre of gothic rock. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote: &quot;Although it abandoned the psychedelic color palette and exchanged alien worship for a vampire cult, goth kept glam&#x27;s theatricality intact, as well as its openness to experimentation.&quot; In April 1977, critic Dave Marsh of &quot;The Morning Record&quot; described Philip Glass&#x27;s current album &quot;North Star&quot; as &quot;the best neo-Gothic rock since John Cale and Terry Riley&#x27;s &quot;Church of Anthrax&quot;, or more appropriately, the first couple of Doors albums&quot;. Reynolds retrospectively described Kate Bush&#x27;s 1978 song &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; as &quot;Gothic romance distilled into four-and-a-half minutes of gaseous rhapsody&quot;.

In the late 1970s, the word &quot;gothic&quot; was used to describe the atmosphere of post-punk bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Magazine and Joy Division. In a live review about a Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; concert in July 1978, critic Nick Kent wrote that concerning their performance, &quot;parallels and comparisons can now be drawn with gothic rock architects like the Doors and, certainly, early Velvet Underground&quot;. In March 1979, Kent used the gothic adjective in his review of Magazine&#x27;s second album, &quot;Secondhand Daylight&quot;. Kent noted that there was &quot;a new austere sense of authority&quot; to their music, with a &quot;dank neo-Gothic sound&quot;. The second Siouxsie and the Banshees album, also released in 1979, was a precursor in several aspects. For journalist Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;A lot of musical signifiers... – scything, effects-laden guitar, pounding tribal drums – are audible, on... &quot;Join Hands&quot;&quot;. In September, Joy Division&#x27;s manager Tony Wilson described their music as &quot;gothic&quot; on the television show &quot;Something Else&quot;, and their producer Martin Hannett described their style as &quot;dancing music with gothic overtones&quot;. In 1980, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote that &quot;Joy Division are masters of this gothic gloom&quot;. When their final album &quot;Closer&quot; came out a couple of months after the suicide of their singer Ian Curtis, &quot;Sounds&quot; noted in its review that there were &quot;dark strokes of gothic rock&quot;.

===Origins===
Not long after, the &quot;gothic&quot; label &quot;became a critical term of abuse&quot; for a band like Bauhaus, who had arrived on the music scene in 1979. At the time, &quot;NME&quot; considered that &quot;Siouxsie and the Banshees, Adam and the Ants and even... Joy Division&quot; opened up &quot;a potentially massive market&quot; for newcomers like Bauhaus and Killing Joke: journalist Andy Gill then separated these two groups of bands, pointing out that there was a difference &quot;between art and artifice&quot;.

However, Bauhaus&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;, released in late 1979, was retrospectively considered to be the beginning of the gothic rock genre. According to Peter Murphy, the song was written to be tongue-in-cheek, but since the group performed it with &quot;naïve seriousness&quot;, that is how the audience understood it. Bauhaus released their debut album &quot;In the Flat Field&quot; in 1980, and the album is often considered the first gothic rock album.

In the early 1980s, post-punk bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Cure included more gothic characteristics in their music. According to Reynolds, with their fourth album, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Juju&quot;, the Banshees included several gothic qualities, lyrically and sonically, whereas according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Juju&quot; was art rock on certain album tracks and pop on the singles. Their bassist, Steven Severin, attributed the aesthetic used by the Banshees around that time to the influence of the Cramps. The Cure&#x27;s &quot;oppressively dispirited&quot; trio of albums, &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; (1980), &quot;Faith&quot; (1981) and &quot;Pornography&quot; (1982), cemented that group&#x27;s stature in the genre. The line &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter if we all die&quot; began the &quot;Pornography&quot; album, which is considered as &quot;the Cure&#x27;s gothic piece de resistance&quot;. They would later become the most commercially successful of these groups. The Cure&#x27;s style was &quot;withdrawn&quot;, contrasting with their contemporaries like Nick Cave&#x27;s the Birthday Party, who drew on blues and violent turmoil. With the Birthday Party&#x27;s &quot;Junkyard&quot; album, Nick Cave combined &quot;sacred and profane&quot; things, using Old Testament imagery with stories about sin, curses and damnation. Their 1981 single &quot;Release the Bats&quot; was particularly influential in the scene.

Killing Joke were originally inspired by Public Image Ltd., borrowing from funk, disco, dub and, later, heavy metal. Calling their style &quot;tension music&quot;, Killing Joke distorted these elements to provocative effect, as well as producing a morbid, politically charged visual style. Reynolds identified the Birthday Party and Killing Joke as essential proto-goth groups. Despite their legacy as progenitors of gothic rock, those groups disliked the label. Adam Ant&#x27;s early work was also a major impetus for the gothic rock scene, and much of the fanbase came from his milieu. Other early contributors to the scene included UK Decay and Ireland&#x27;s Virgin Prunes.

Gothic rock would not be adopted as &quot;positive identity, a tribal rallying cry&quot; until a shift in the scene in 1982. In London, the Batcave club opened 21 July 1982 to provide a venue for the goth scene: the band Specimen gave many concerts there. That same year, Ian Astbury of the band Southern Death Cult used the term &quot;gothic goblins&quot; to describe Sex Gang Children&#x27;s fans. Southern Death Cult became icons of the scene, drawing aesthetic inspiration from Native American culture and appearing on the cover of &quot;NME&quot; in October.

=== Expansion of the scene ===

In February 1983, the emerging scene was described as &quot;positive punk&quot; on the front cover of &quot;NME&quot;: in his article, journalist Richard North described Bauhaus, Theatre of Hate and UK Decay as &quot;the immediate forerunners of today&#x27;s flood&quot;, and declared, &quot;So here it is: the new positive punk, with no empty promises of revolution, either in the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll sense or the wider political sphere. Here is only a chance of self-awareness, of personal revolution, of colourful perception and galvanization of the imagination that startles the slumbering mind and body from their sloth&quot;. That year, myriad goth groups emerged, including Flesh for Lulu, Play Dead, Rubella Ballet, Gene Loves Jezebel, Blood and Roses, and Ausgang. The 4AD label released music in a more ethereal style, by groups such as Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance, and Xmal Deutschland. The Icelandic group Kukl also appeared in this period, which included Björk and other musicians who later participated in the Sugarcubes.

Reynolds has spoken of a shift from early goth to gothic rock proper, advanced by the Sisters of Mercy. As journalist Jennifer Park put it, &quot;The original blueprint for gothic rock had mutated significantly. Doom and gloom was no longer confined to its characteristic atmospherics, but as the Sisters demonstrated, it could really rock&quot;. The Sisters of Mercy, who cited influences such as Leonard Cohen, Gary Glitter, Motörhead, the Stooges, the Velvet Underground, the Birthday Party, Suicide, and the Fall, created a new, harder form of gothic rock. In addition, they incorporated a drum machine. Reynolds identified their 1983 single &quot;Temple of Love&quot; as the quintessential goth anthem of the year, along with Southern Death Cult&#x27;s &quot;Fatman&quot;. The group created their own record label, Merciful Release, which also signed the March Violets, who performed in a similar style. According to Reynolds, the March Violets &quot;imitated Joy Division sonically&quot;. Another band, the Danse Society was particularly inspired by the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Pornography&quot; period.

=== Subsequent developments ===

American gothic rock began with 45 Grave and Christian Death. This harder, more punk rock-influenced style of gothic rock became known as deathrock. Christian Death combined &quot;self-consciously controversial tactics&quot; with Los Angeles punk and heavy metal influences. Their singer Rozz Williams committed suicide by hanging in 1998 at age 34. 45 Grave was more inspired by heavy metal than Christian Death and featured female singer Dinah Cancer. Some punk and garage rock bands like the Cramps, the Gun Club, Lydia Lunch, the Nuns, the Misfits and T.S.O.L. have been credited to be influential on both the sound and the aesthetics of the goth subculture in America, being subsequently credited to be pioneers in the &quot;goth punk&quot; sub-genre. Notable 1980s American goth bands include Super Heroines, Human Drama, the Wake and Kommunity FK.

Later stages of gothic rock came with a shift in sound and commercial success. Southern Death Cult reformed as the Cult, a more conventional hard rock group. Bauhaus members reformed as the psychedelia-influenced Love and Rockets achieving both critical and commercial success during the late 1980s and &#x27;90s. In their wake, the Mission, which included two former members of the Sisters of Mercy (Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams), achieved commercial success in the mid-1980s to early 1990s, as did Fields of the Nephilim and All About Eve. European groups inspired by gothic rock also proliferated, including Clan of Xymox. Other bands associated with gothic rock include All Living Fear, And Also the Trees, Balaam and the Angel, Claytown Troupe, Dream Disciples, Feeding Fingers, Inkubus Sukkubus, Libitina, Miranda Sex Garden, Nosferatu, Rosetta Stone, and Suspiria. The 1990s saw a resurgence of the goth subculture, fueled largely by crossover from the industrial, electronic and metal scenes; and goth culture and aesthetic again worked itself into the mainstream consciousness, inspiring thriving goth music scenes in most cities and notoriety throughout popular culture. Beginning in the early 1990s, gothic metal fused &quot;the bleak, icy atmospherics of goth rock with the loud guitars and aggression of heavy metal.&quot; In the 2000s, critics regularly noticed the influence of goth on bands of that time period. English band the Horrors mixed 1960s garage rock with 1980s goth. When referencing female singer Zola Jesus, writers questioned if she announced the second coming of the genre as her music was described with this term.

== Visual elements ==
In terms of fashion, gothic bands incorporated influences from 19th-century gothic literature along with horror films and, to a lesser extent, the BDSM culture. Gothic fashions within the subculture range from deathrock, punk, androgynous, Victorian, to Renaissance and medieval-style attire, or combinations of the above, most often with black clothing, makeup and hair. Crimped hair was popular among gothic fans in the 1980s.

==Impact==
In the 1990s, several acts such as PJ Harvey, Marilyn Manson, Manic Street Preachers, and Nine Inch Nails included gothic characteristics in their music. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, PJ Harvey&#x27;s music in 1993 &quot;careens from blues to goth to grunge, often in the space of a single song&quot; whereas American artists such as Marilyn Manson combined &quot;atmosphere from goth and disco&quot; with &quot;industrial sound&quot;. In 1997, &quot;Spin&quot; qualified Portishead&#x27;s second album as &quot;gothic&quot;, &quot;deadly&quot; and &quot;trippy&quot;. Critic Barry Walters observed that the group got &quot;darker, deeper and more disturbing&quot; in comparison to their debut album &quot;Dummy&quot;. In the late 2010s, the Twilight Sad included gothic elements in their music.

<text>Atkinson is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 7,087 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Atkinson&#x27;s history dates back to the American Revolution. The community was incorporated September 3, 1767, and was named after Colonel Theodore Atkinson, a local landowner.

Atkinson Academy, the second-oldest co-educational school in the country, was founded as a boys&#x27; school in 1787 by Reverend Stephen Peabody, General Nathaniel Peabody and Doctor William Cogswell; it began admitting girls in 1791. The school building burned to the ground in 1802, and was rebuilt in 1803 at a cost of $2,500. That building remains a part of the academy, which has since been expanded, with only four classrooms.

The Kimball House Museum occupies a structure that was built in 1772 by the Reverend Stephen Peabody. In April 1907, Rev. Joseph A. Kimball, a summer resident, purchased the building from the Maddocks family in order to create a library for the town.

Atkinson&#x27;s history can be read about in the book &quot;Atkinson Then and Now&quot;, which can be purchased at the Atkinson Public Library on Academy Avenue.

Atkinson celebrated its 250th anniversary on Labor Day weekend 2017.

<text>Auburn is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,946 at the 2020 census, up from 4,953 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
Auburn was originally settled by Native Americans in 1624. It was a fishing settlement called by Native Americans &quot;Massabesic&quot; (the current name of the town&#x27;s largest lake). British settlers arrived in the area in 1720 and made peace with the Natives until the French and Indian War. The Massabesic settlement was destroyed, and the nearby town of Chester claimed the land. It was known as &quot;Chester Woods&quot;, &quot;Chester West Parish&quot;, &quot;Long Meadow&quot;, and then Auburn. Auburn became an independent town on June 25, 1845, with a population of 1,200 people. As with Auburn, Maine, Auburn, Massachusetts, and Auburn, New York, the name is from Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s popular 18th-century poem, &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;, which begins:

:Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain,
:Where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain
:Where smiling spring its earliest visit paid,
:And parting summer&#x27;s lingering blooms delayed

Auburn was served by the Concord and Portsmouth Railroad, which later became the Portsmouth Branch of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad. Auburn was home to a small passenger depot at one time, but by the mid 1900s most rail activity was through traffic, as Auburn had few on-line industries. The last freight trains passed through in the early 1980s. The track was abandoned in 1982 and subsequently torn up between 1983 and 1985.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 12.01%, are water. Massabesic Lake, located in the western part of Auburn and the eastern part of Manchester, is the largest body of water in Auburn and serves as the public water supply for Manchester. The lake is fed by numerous tributaries, most notable being Sucker Brook, which enters the northeastern end of the lake near the Auburn town center and itself drains several lakes, including Tower Hill Pond, Clark Pond, and Little Massabesic Lake. Cohas Brook flows through the eastern portion of Auburn and eventually (in Manchester) receives the outflow of Massabesic Lake before flowing west to the Merrimack River. Auburn lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed. Three hills, all overlooking Massabesic Lake, can lay potential claim to being Auburn&#x27;s highest point: Mount Miner, at above sea level, located north of the lake; Mine Hill, greater than , above the east shore; and Mount Misery, greater than 580 feet, to the southeast.

===Adjacent municipalities===
* Candia (north)
* Chester (east)
* Derry (southeast)
* Londonderry (southwest)
* Manchester (west)
* Hooksett (northwest)

==Climate==

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Auburn has a warm-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Auburn was on August 3, 1988, while the coldest temperature recorded was on February 16, 1943.

== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2000, there were 4,682 people, 1,580 households, and 1,322 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 1,622 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 98.29% White, 0.21% African American, 0.23% Native American, 0.41% Asian, 0.23% from other races, and 0.62% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.94% of the population.

There were 2,349 households, out of which 44.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 75.1% were married couples living together, 5.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 16.3% were non-families. 11.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.96 and the average family size was 3.22.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 28.9% under the age of 18, 6.2% from 18 to 24, 33.0% from 25 to 44, 25.8% from 45 to 64, and 6.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.2 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $70,774, and the median income for a family was $72,578. Males had a median income of $45,000 versus $33,365 for females. The per capita income for the town was $28,405. About 1.6% of families and 1.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 0.7% of those under age 18 and 11.2% of those age 65 or over.

Since Auburn has an agreement with the city of Manchester that the city and the surrounding towns can use Massabesic Lake as a water source, Manchester, Chester, Candia, Hooksett and Derry pay Auburn an estimated $3 million for Lake Massabesic.

== Attractions ==
Lake Massabesic covers over in Auburn and Manchester and serves as the public water supply for the city of Manchester. Half of the lake (the half farthest from the public water intake) is used for less-intrusive types of boating. No swimming or other contact between users and water is allowed. Devil&#x27;s Den is a small cave east of Massabesic Lake. The Massabesic Audubon Center is in central Auburn, occupying Battery Point on the lake. The Griffin Mill Dam along Little Massabesic Brook-Sucker Brook is in the northeastern part of the town.

== Events and festivals ==

=== Lake Massabesic Duck Race ===
Every year, the Auburn Historical Association hosts an annual Duck Race on Hooksett Road near a river that flows into Lake Massabesic. The main event starts at the Hooksett road bridge over the Little Massabesic Brook-Sucker Brook where a truck dumps thousands of yellow rubber ducks into the brook, lined with straight yellow floating tubes, and the race ends at a finish line on the left side of the Griffin Mill Bridge, past the waterfall. People buy individual ducks, with prizes going to the owners of the &quot;fastest&quot; ducks to reach the finish line. The event attracts thousands of onlookers each year, to partake in the selection of goods offered at rented booths and/or to watch the ducks leisurely float down the river. There are games for younger kids (usually provided by Auburn Village School volunteers). Visitors are able to access the Griffin Free Public Library, or browse the related booths parked in the Griffin Free Public Library&#x27;s parking lot. 
An official pie contest happens at a booth in the Duck race, with 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winner&#x27;s getting special clay pie trays.

=== Yacht Sail Boating Club race ===
Every Sunday, sometimes also during the week, the Yacht Sail Boating Club hosts a sailboat race. Members of the club start on the northern shore of Massabesic Lake, and it ends after going 3 laps around the lake. Many visitors enjoy watching the races from their kayaks, sailboats, and canoes, or at Battery Point, the northernmost point on the Massabesic Peninsula.

=== Book sale ===
The last weekend in July, the Griffin Free Public Library holds a huge book sale at the Auburn Village School. Approximately 10,000 books and games are sold, with all proceeds benefiting the library&#x27;s programs.

==Education==

Auburn is part of School Administrative Unit 15, along with the neighboring towns of Hooksett and Candia. SAU-15 administers five schools with Auburn Village School, serving all elementary school and middle school students (grades K–8) in the town.

SAU-15 has no high school; students from Auburn attend high school at Pinkerton Academy (in Derry).

Previously Auburn students attended high school in the Manchester School District, with the vast majority going to Manchester Memorial High School. In 2011, the town voted to change its high school to Pinkerton, with 1,119 in favor and 190 opposing. In 2011 some Auburn students already chose to go to Pinkerton.

== Transportation ==
Three state highways pass through the town. New Hampshire Route 101 is a four-lane expressway that passes through the northern part of the town, leading west to neighboring Manchester and east to Exeter. Access to Auburn is from Exit 2 within the town and Exit 1 just west of the town. New Hampshire Route 28 Bypass travels through the west side of Auburn, leading south to Derry and north to Hooksett. NH 28 Bypass intersects NH 101 at that highway&#x27;s Exit 1. New Hampshire Route 121 passes through the center of Auburn, leading east to Chester.

<text>Basin is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jefferson County, Montana, United States. It lies approximately southeast of the Continental Divide in a high narrow canyon along Interstate 15 about halfway between Butte and Helena. Basin Creek flows roughly north to south through Basin and enters the Boulder River on the settlement&#x27;s south side. The population was 212 at the 2010 census, down from 255 at the 2000 census.

Archaeologists have discovered evidence of human habitation from 10,000 years ago at a site near Clancy, northeast of Basin. From about 2000 BCE through the mid-19th century, nomadic tribes hunted bison in the grassy valleys that trend east, away from the Rocky Mountains and into the plains. By the time miners found gold in the streams in and near Basin, most of these tribes of Indians had been forced onto reservations by the U.S. government.

Basin rests above the Boulder Batholith, the host rock for many valuable mineral ores found in this part of Montana. After the town became a hub of gold and silver mining, Basin&#x27;s population peaked at about 1,500 in the first decade of the 20th century but gradually declined as the mines were depleted. Abandoned mining equipment, closed or barricaded mine portals, and the ruins of a smelter and ore concentrator remain in Basin in the 21st century.

Historic buildings from Basin&#x27;s heyday form much of the core of the CDP&#x27;s small business district, which includes a fire station, a post office, two restaurants, a bar, a commercial gallery, and small specialty shops. Basin has a small elementary school, its own water system, and a low-power radio station. Local volunteers and elected trustees provide limited services to the settlement, but it relies on the government of Jefferson County for law enforcement and other services. From 1993 through 2011, Basin was home to the Montana Artists Refuge.

== Geography and geology ==
Basin, in Jefferson County, is part of the Helena Micropolitan Statistical Area. It lies at an elevation of above sea level along Interstate 15 about by road north of Butte and south of Helena in a narrow canyon. The community is largely surrounded by the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. Basin Creek flows south through the center of Basin to its confluence with a larger stream, the Boulder River, which flows east along the south side of Basin. No paved roads except the interstate highway, which runs along the river canyon, connect Basin to other towns. About upstream on Basin Creek lies the Continental Divide. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

In the late Cretaceous (roughly 81 to 74 million years ago), molten rock (magma) rose to the Earth&#x27;s surface in and near what later became Jefferson County and eventually formed an intrusive body of granitic rock up to thick and in diameter. This body, known as the Boulder Batholith, extends from Helena to Butte, and is the host rock for the many valuable ores mined in the region. As the granite cooled, it cracked, and hot solutions infiltrated the cracks to form mineral veins bearing gold and other metals. Millions of years later, weathering allowed gold in the veins to wash down to the gravels in Basin Creek, Cataract Creek, and the other creeks near Basin, as well as the Boulder River.

The Basin area is underlain by the quartz monzonite of the Boulder Batholith. The batholith is overlain by dacite from the Paleogene and Neogene periods (roughly 66 million to 1.8 million years ago) and andesite from the late Cretaceous. The andesite and monzonite are cut by dikes of dacite and rhyolite.

== History ==

=== First peoples ===
Archeologists think it likely that the first people to live in Montana crossed from Asia to North America over the Bering Land Bridge that existed during the last major Ice Age about 12,000 years ago. Because the middle of the continent was covered with sheets of ice, people who migrated south did so on trails along the edges of glaciers melted by seasonal warming. One such trail, called the Great North Trail, is thought to have followed the Rocky Mountain Front into Montana, passing close to Helena, north of Basin, and continuing into the east-central part of the state. Evidence of these early Paleo-Indians or Clovis people has been found at three sites, one of them the McHaffie site near Clancy about north of Basin. The age of the Clancy artifacts is estimated to be 10,000 years. The Clovis people are thought to have disappeared in about 4,000 to 5,000 BCE when the Montana climate became more dry and would not support the animal populations the Clovis needed to survive.

About 2,000 years ago, a new prehistoric people known as the Late Hunters appeared in Montana, thriving on a bison (buffalo) population living in open grassy areas on the plains and in river valleys. The earliest tribes are thought to have been the Kootenai, who stayed west of the Continental Divide, and the Flathead (Salish), and Pend d&#x27;Oreilles, who ventured east of the mountains into and east of the Three Forks country, southeast of Basin. In the 17th century, the Crow entered Montana from the east and the Shoshone from the south. Pressed by other tribes retreating west from white European settlers, the Blackfeet moved into Montana around 1730. Acquiring horses and firearms, and numbering about 15,000, they formed alliances with other incoming tribes, the Assiniboine and the Gros Ventres, and by the mid-18th century dominated the state. When the white explorers Lewis and Clark traveled up the Missouri River to Three Forks, they found only Blackfeet and Blackfeet allies. Heavily dependent on bison, the nomadic life of the Blackfeet &quot;came to an abrupt end in the early 1880s when the buffalo became almost extinct.&quot;

During the 1870s, a few years after the first white miners began looking for gold near Basin, the last large-scale battles between the U.S. government and the Indians took place in Montana. The Marias Massacre (also known as the Baker Massacre), occurred in 1870 about northeast of Basin. Others, the Battle of the Little Bighorn and the Battle of the Rosebud, were fought in 1876 about from Basin in the southeastern part of the state. By then, most first peoples had been moved to reservations, which were far from Basin.

=== Camp ===
The town of Basin began as a 19th century mining camp near the confluence of Basin Creek with the Boulder River. Gold deposits at the mouth of Cataract Creek, about downstream of Basin were reported as early as 1862. Prospectors staked claims and built cabins, and within a few years placer mining extended the full lengths of Cataract and Basin Creeks. When a settlement was established in Basin, the buildings at the mouth of Cataract Creek were gradually moved to Basin, and the Cataract camp was abandoned.

Searches for the lode veins on both creeks succeeded by the 1870s and eventually led to significant lode mining at the Eva May, Uncle Sam, Grey Eagle, Hattie Ferguson, and Comet mines in the Cataract Creek district and the Bullion, Hope, and Katy mines in the Basin Creek district. By 1880, the settlement at Basin became the local source of supplies for mines and miners.

=== Boom and bust ===
Two mines, the Katy and the Hope, owned serially by several different companies between the mid-1890s and the mid-1920s, contributed to Basin&#x27;s prosperity. In 1894, the Basin and Bay State Mining Company, organized by two brothers named Glass, began expanded operations at these mines. However, flooding and fires caused both mines to close by 1896; the Glass brothers lost control of the property, and the mines went idle. Despite the ups and downs of the local mines and despite several disastrous fires in town, Basin prospered. In 1905, the Basin Reduction Company led by F. Augustus Heinze, who owned mines in Butte, took over the properties left by the Glass brothers and improved them. By then, Basin had a population of 1,500, four rooming houses, a drug store, three hotels, a bath house, three grocery stores, a bank, a newspaper, and 12 saloons.

An unpublished manuscript on file with the Montana State Historical Society describes life in Basin between 1906 and 1910 in great detail. Two railroads, the Northern Pacific on the north side of the Boulder River, and the Great Northern on the south side, served the city; both had depots and warehouses in Basin and carried passengers as well as freight. The Glass brothers&#x27; smelter had been set up on the north side to process concentrated ore delivered by rail from out of town or from the mills on the south side. Infrastructure included a weight scale for ore cars and an overhead tram to carry ore across the river from the reduction mill to the smelter. Although the smelter was a &quot;massive unit&quot; equipped with furnaces, conveyors, and machinery ready for operation, it &quot;never turned a wheel&quot;.

While the smelter sat idle, mining activity continued on the south side of the river in the Hope-Katy mine complex, at the Hope Mill, which crushed and separated ore, and at the Basin Reduction Works. Flumes carried water from upstream on Cataract Creek and Basin Creek to a storage reservoir in town and supplied water to the mills as well as the town&#x27;s fire hydrants. A separate flume carried water to the mills from upstream on the Boulder River. At the Basin Reduction Works, Corliss steam engines, driven by the coal-fired boilers, provided power to run the mine hoists and the mill machinery, and an electric generator powered by a water wheel made electricity for factory lights and the arc lights at Basin&#x27;s street intersections. Surplus tailings were discharged into the river and into a dam built for the purpose downstream of Basin.

In addition to homes, Basin structures between 1906 and 1910 included a dance pavilion, a grandstand, a baseball diamond, and a playground near the confluence of Basin Creek with the river. A footbridge connected the playground with a picnic area on the south side of the river. Meeting places included churches, a union hall, and a two-story building shared by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Masons, and Eastern Star. Among the town&#x27;s businesses were a hardware store, a bakery, livery stables, several &quot;units of harlotry&quot;, a blacksmith shop, a brewery specializing in Basin Beer, a sawmill, and a dairy barn from which &quot;milk was delivered in five-pound buckets&quot;, sometimes with covers.

In 1909, after Heinze abandoned his properties in Basin, the Butte and Superior Mining Company used buildings and machinery at the site of the Basin Reduction Works to treat zinc ore by a new process called froth flotation. Sued for patent infringement, the company shut down its Basin plant in 1912. Max Atwater, a mining engineer who had worked for Butte and Superior, obtained a license for the process and ran a smaller zinc-extraction plant in Basin from 1914 through 1918. His wife, Mary Meigs Atwater, described Basin as &quot;a mining camp, subject to recurring periods of boom and bust... A tiny telephone office and a drugstore died with the end of our era of boom... Just above the town were the headframe of our mine, and the old mill, and the never-quite-finished skeleton of a projected smelter.&quot;

The most extensive and successful mining of the Hope-Katy vein began in 1919, when the Jib Consolidated Mining Company began work on the property. When this company acquired the mines, they comprised of workings. Over the next five years, Jib expanded these to more than , and in 1924 the company became the largest gold producer in Montana. In that year, the combined Jib mines produced about of gold, of silver, of copper, and of lead. In 1925, however, the Jib properties passed from the mining company to trustees for creditors, and production declined. This was the last of Basin&#x27;s mining booms. Since then, small-scale mining, reworking of old mine dumps, and placer mining has continued in the region.

=== Since 1960 ===
For about 50 years, the Merry Widow Health Mine in Basin and similar mines nearby have attracted people seeking relief from health problems such as arthritis through limited exposure to radioactive mine water and radon. The practice is controversial because of the &quot;well-documented ill effects of high-dose radiation on the body.&quot;

In 1975, the Basin community formed water and sewer districts and, using federal grants to cover about 60 percent of the costs, built a water delivery, sewage, and waste-handling system. By 1990, Interstate 15 had replaced the entire length of U.S. Route 91 in the state. The centerline of the Interstate followed the track of the former Great Northern Railway through town.

In 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency added the Basin mining area to the Superfund National Priorities List because of mining-waste problems in and near town. The mining area comprised the watersheds of Basin and Cataract Creek and part of the Boulder River. Contaminants included arsenic, copper, cadmium, lead and other metals. Cleanup of the mining wastes at the Buckeye-Enterprise, Crystal and Bullion mines in the Basin Creek and Cataract watersheds was completed in 2002, and the removal of mine waste from Basin was completed in 2004.

=== Individual mines ===
Almost opposite the Hope-Katy complex on the south side of the Boulder River in Basin was the Katy Extension Mine on the north side. It produced ore from part of the Hope-Katy lode that had been displaced about to the north by faulting. Other mines within of Basin included the Lotta, west of town along the route of Interstate 15; the Basin Bell (Latsch), about north of town along Basin Creek; the Boulder, northeast of Basin on the south slope of Pole Mountain; the Mantle and South Mantle, about north of town along Cataract Creek; and the Obelisk, east of town near the road that later became Interstate 15.

== Climate ==
July and August are typically the warmest months in Boulder, approximately east of Basin, while December and January are the coldest. May and June are the wettest months, when a total of about of precipitation falls. Weather observations were recorded in Basin from June 1949 to November 1970, but only contained precipitation and snowfall data.

== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2000, there were 255 people, 113 households, and 69 families residing in the CDP. The population density was about 20 people per square mile (8/km2). The CDP contained 146 housing units. Basin&#x27;s racial makeup was about 95% White, 2% Native American, and about 4% other. Hispanic or Latino persons of any race were 2% of the population. The population decreased to 212 by 2010 and to 199 as of the census of 2020.

In 2000, 29% of the households included children under the age of 18; 51% were married couples living together, 5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 39% were non-families. 33% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 2.93.

The population was spread out in 2000, with 27% under the age of 18, 5% from 18 to 24, 29% from 25 to 44, 31% from 45 to 64, and 8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 95 males.

The median income for a household in 2000 for the CDP was $22,500, and the median income for a family was about $30,000. Males had a median income of $26,000 versus $16,000 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $12,000. About 23% of families and 33% of the population were below the poverty line, including 56% of those under the age of 18 and 17% of those 65 or over. By 2020, the median household income had risen to $49,000.

== Arts and culture ==
In 1993, a group of professional artists established the Montana Artists Refuge in Basin. The nonprofit organization offered artist residencies in two historic buildings, a former bank and meeting hall and a former dry goods store converted to apartment and studio space. The organization sponsored annual art events including the American Indian Artists Symposium and the Basin City Jazz Art Experience, held in the Basin Community Hall. All types of artists, including potters, painters, musicians, dancers, singers, weavers, and writers, had residencies in Basin. The refuge closed in October 2011.

== Education, business, and government ==

The school districts for the community are Basin Elementary School District and Jefferson High School District A public elementary school, Basin Grade School, serves about 20 students, pre-kindergarten through sixth grade. Older students attend school in Boulder.
The town&#x27;s small business district includes a bar, two restaurants, a traveler&#x27;s inn, a wellness center, small specialty shops, and a pottery gallery. A low-power radio station, KBAS-LP, 98.3 FM, owned by Jefferson County Disaster and Emergency Services, broadcasts from Basin.

County, state, and federal agencies provide most of the government services available in Basin. Local residents serve as elected trustees of the Basin Fire District and its volunteer fire department. Elected trustees also oversee the Basin Water and Sewer District. The Jefferson County sheriff&#x27;s department provides law enforcement, and other county departments offer trash removal and recycling, emergency management services, and road maintenance. The county health department has a clinic in Boulder, east of Basin, and the county courthouse, district court, and the nearest branch of the county library are also in Boulder. The United States Postal Service has a post office in Basin.

<doc id="124882" wikidata="Q910003" url="?curid=124882" title="Brentwood, New Hampshire">
<text>Brentwood is a town and county seat of Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. At the 2020 census, its population was 4,490.

==History==
An Abenaki tribe called the Pennacook farmed, fished and hunted in what is now Brentwood. Two main foot trails ran through the town, one along the Exeter River, where arrowheads and other stone and wooden artifacts have been found. At Pickpocket Dam, this pathway joined with the Pentucket Trail leading south to Pentucket (now Haverhill, Massachusetts) and north further into Pennacook territory.

The first non-native settlers came in 1652 to start a sawmill powered by a waterfall on the Exeter River.

===Division and redivision===
The town was once a part of Exeter known as Brentwood (or Brintwood) Parish. It was named after Brentwood, Essex, originally called &quot;Burnt Wood&quot;, where, in 1177, King Henry II granted permission for of the king&#x27;s forest to be cut, burned and cultivated.

Beginning in 1738, residents living in the southwestern portion of Exeter, now Brentwood and Fremont, petitioned to be set off, but were denied. They cited difficulty of getting to the Exeter church/meetinghouse, where weekly attendance was obligatory, and the requirement to pay Exeter taxes. Eighteen people wrote in dissent, saying that even the proposed new town would require travel more than two miles to a new meetinghouse. On June 26, 1742, colonial governor Benning Wentworth set Brentwood off from Exeter and incorporated it.

The meetinghouse was planned at &quot;the west side of the &#x27;Gully&#x27;&quot;, but those living south of the Exeter River said it was hard to reach in spring and fall. For a while, church was held at two venues, north and south of the river.

Residents petitioned for a dividing line between the midpoints of the northern and southern boundaries. In 1744, Gov. Wentworth issued a King&#x27;s Patent to establish a new town called &quot;Keeneborough Parish&quot;, named after his friend, Sir Benjamin Keene (1697–1757), English minister to Spain. Brentwood continued to tax the residents of Keeneborough; one resident was imprisoned for failing to pay, and the General Assembly called Wentworth&#x27;s action a &quot;usurpation.&quot; Minister Nathaniel Trask reconciled the factions and Keeneborough reunited with Brentwood in 1750. The westerners petitioned again for separation in 1757 and 1763. In 1764, Brentwood did divide, the western half calling itself &quot;Poplin&quot; (now Fremont).

After Rev. Trask&#x27;s death in 1789, the Congregationalists lamented the decline of religion and morality in favor of alcohol. The town licensed its first &quot;dram shop&quot; in 1792 and licensed 28 of them over eleven years. A handful of slaves were held in Brentwood, but none at the 1800 or subsequent censuses.

===Development===
Mills along the rivers produced lumber and manufactured goods in the early days. The economy later shifted towards agriculture. The town is now predominantly residential.

The Rockingham County Complex on North Road (the only road owned by the county) traces its history to 1916. It was called the &quot;poor farm&quot; or the &quot;county farm&quot;, but the only current farming is hay. It has administrative offices, a nursing home, and the county jail. In 1997, when county offices and courts moved from the Exeter courthouse to a former industrial headquarters off Calef Road, Brentwood became the county seat.

Retail development is focused along Calef Road, though home businesses exist elsewhere for historical reasons. There is an industrial zone in the northeast, along Pine Road, which spans Brentwood and Exeter. In 2012, Exeter, resenting the wear on its part of the road from heavy vehicles from the businesses in Brentwood, posted a weight limit on its part, which led to lengthy detours and a lawsuit and counter-suit. These were settled in 2014, as the judge ruled that Exeter&#x27;s posting was illegal. Brentwood had to reimburse Exeter, but only the amounts for upgrading Pine Road to handle the heavy vehicles.

The 2014 fatal shooting of police officer Stephen Arkell, who arrived at a condominium to investigate a domestic disturbance, led to many memorials and continuing events in his name, such as an annual 5K run. In 2021, the section of Route 125 within Brentwood was officially named the Officer Stephen Arkell Memorial Highway.

==Geography==
Brentwood is a nearly square quadrangle, except that the town line follows the Exeter River in the southeastern corner.
Brentwood has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.93% of the town. The highest point in Brentwood is Great Hill, at above sea level, whose summit is in the southeastern corner of the town.

The town is drained by the Exeter River and its tributary Dudley Brook. The Piscassic River, a tributary of the Lamprey River, crosses the northwestern corner of the town. Brentwood lies fully within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed.

===Adjacent municipalities===
* Epping (north)
* Exeter (east)
* Kingston (south)
* Fremont (west)

==Government==
Brentwood&#x27;s executive is a five-person board of selectmen, serving staggered three-year terms and meeting weekly (biweekly in spring and summer). Brentwood&#x27;s legislature is a town meeting, held in March, at which every registered voter can vote on the annual town budget and amendments to it. The Swasey Elementary School has a separate town meeting. Classes above Grade 6 travel to regional schools in School Administrative Unit (SAU) 16.

SAU 16 is governed by official ballot referendum (SB 2), in which there is a &quot;deliberative&quot; town meeting but the final vote is by secret ballot in all participating towns, at the same annual election at which voters elect town and school officials. Every town in SAU 16 votes on the representative(s) of it and of all other towns in SAU 16.

Citizen petitions have sought to change Brentwood&#x27;s two town meetings to SB 2, but have always fallen short of the 60% vote required.

==Transportation==
Middle Road (Route 111A) runs east/west and bisects the town. Other east/west roads are North Road and South Road. Calef Road (Route 125) is the principal north/south road.

The expressway Route 101 approximately follows Brentwood&#x27;s northern boundary. It provides access to Manchester and to the Seacoast. Route 101 crosses into northeast Brentwood, as does Route 27 (old 101) beyond it. Part of New England Dragway is in Brentwood.

Route 111A east to Exeter gains access to Route 7 of the COAST bus system, and to a train station served by the Amtrak &quot;Downeaster.&quot; At the park and ride lot off Calef Road just north of Brentwood, there is bus service to Boston, Massachusetts and its Logan Airport. Shuttle bus service can be arranged to Manchester Boston Regional Airport.

==Religion==
The original church, on Route 111A, is now known as the Pilgrim United Church of Christ, Brentwood-Kingston. In addition, Brentwood First Baptist Church has been at the same location since 1771. Grace Ministries holds religious services and a Christian grade school in a former industrial building on Calef Road. There is also a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, which has two congregations.

<text>Candia is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,013 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Candia, Candia Four Corners and East Candia.

==History==
Settled in 1743, Candia was once part of Chester and known as &quot;Charmingfare&quot;, probably because of the many bridle paths or &quot;parades&quot; through the pleasant scenery. Charmingfare was incorporated in 1763 and named Candia &quot;in compliment to Governor Benning Wentworth, who was once a prisoner on the island of Candia (an alternative ancient name of Crete since its Venetian domination), in the Mediterranean Sea.&quot;

Candia was served by the Portsmouth &amp; Concord Railroad, which stretched between its namesake cities. In 1862 the segment between Candia and Suncook was abandoned, coinciding with the opening of a new segment between Manchester and Candia. Therefore, the new line ran from Manchester to Portsmouth via Candia. In 1895 ownership of the line passed to the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, who made it their Portsmouth Branch. Passenger service ended in 1954. The last trains passed through Candia in the early 1980s. The track was abandoned in 1982 and removed between 1983 and 1985. Today the railbed is part of the Rockingham Recreational Trail.

==Geography==
Candia is in southeastern New Hampshire, along the western edge of Rockingham County. The town is bordered to the west by Merrimack County. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of . of it are land and of it are water, comprising 0.75% of the town. Notable villages in the town include Candia proper, near the town&#x27;s northern border; Candia Four Corners, closer to the geographic center of the town; and East Candia, near the town&#x27;s eastern border.

The majority of Candia is drained to the east by the North Branch River, a tributary of the Lamprey River and part of the Piscataqua River watershed. The southern part and some of the western side of town drain toward Massabesic Lake in neighboring Auburn, part of the Merrimack River watershed. The highest point in town is Hall Mountain, at above sea level, located in Bear Brook State Park in the northwestern part of the town. (The main entrance to the state park and most of its facilities are in neighboring Allenstown.)

Candia is bisected by two state highways, Route 43 running north from Route 101 through the Candia Four Corners to the Deerfield town line, and Route 27, running east–west from the Hooksett town line through the Candia Four Corners to the Raymond town line. Route 101 is the major east–west thoroughfare through southern New Hampshire and travels through the southern part of Candia.

<text>Chester is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,232 at the 2020 census, up from 4,768 at the 2010 census. It was home to the now defunct Chester College (formerly White Pines College).

==History==
From &quot;Statistics and Gazetteer of New-Hampshire&quot;, 1875:
&quot;Chester is considered one of the old towns of the state. In 1719, about eighty persons, chiefly from Portsmouth and Hampton, formed an association, for the purpose of securing a tract of land in the &quot;Chesnut Country&quot; (so called) and stationed three men upon this tract, to hold possession until they should procure a lawful title. After considerable difficulty they obtained a grant of land, ten miles [16 km] square. Immediately the settlement was commenced by several persons from Rye and Hampton, among whom were Samuel Ingalls, Jonathan Goodhue, Jacob Sargent, Ebenezer Dearborn, Robert Smith, E. Colby and S. Robie, who contributed largely to the permanent success of the enterprise. On the 8th of May, 1722 the township which had hitherto been called Cheshire, was incorporated under its present name, and comprising an area of over 120 square miles [310 km2].&quot;

Chester once included Candia, set off in 1763. It may have been the first of the settlement grants by Massachusetts selected for expansion of growing populations in the seacoast. The name may be derived from Chester, the county town of the county of Cheshire in England. Earl of Chester is a title held by the Prince of Wales.

<text>Eureka is a town in Lincoln County, Montana, United States, south of the Canada–US border. The population was 1,380 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Eureka was founded in the early 1880s as settlers moved north from Missoula and south from Canada; it was originally known as Deweyville. One of the last areas to be developed in Montana in frontier times, logging was a major draw and source of income for decades. Eureka was once billed as the &quot;Christmas Tree Capital of the World,&quot; with evergreens shipped to many urban points for holiday sales.

The Canadian fur-trapper and explorer David Thompson visited the area in the early 19th Century during his searches for a route to the Pacific Ocean. Early explorers, finding Indians there growing a native strain of tobacco, named it the Tobacco Plains. In the late 1970s, Eurekans began a &quot;Tobacco Valley Rendezvous&quot; every year in April to commemorate Thompson&#x27;s visit.

President Harry S. Truman gave a speech in Eureka on October 1, 1952, as part of a whistle-stop tour in support of Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign.

Owens &amp; Hurst Lumber mill closed in 2005.

<text>Libby is a city in northwestern Montana, United States and the county seat of Lincoln County. The population was 2,775 at the 2020 census.

Libby suffered from the area&#x27;s contamination from nearby vermiculite mines contaminated with particularly fragile asbestos, leading to the town&#x27;s inclusion in the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s National Priorities List status in 2002 and Public Health Emergency event in 2009. Most risk was reduced by 2015.

Local natural features, such as the Kootenai Falls, have attracted tourism to the area and have been featured in movies, such as &quot;The River Wild&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015). There is a public school district and a public library, and the town is in-district for Flathead Valley Community College, which operates the Lincoln County Campus there.

== History ==
Continental and alpine glaciers shaped the area&#x27;s valleys and lakes. The first indigenous peoples arrived at least 8,000 years ago and hunted and gathered for food. The earliest known American settler, David Thompson, arrived in the 1800s, and early American economic activity included &quot;fur trading, railroad construction, mining, and logging.&quot; Miners flocked to Libby Creek in 1867. It was deserted by the 1870s. In 1892, with the arrival of the Great Northern Railway, the town moved downstream and the name was shortened from Libbysville to Libby.

==Geography==
Libby is on U.S. Route 2 at its junction with Montana Highway 37. It is at the confluence of Libby Creek and the Kootenai River.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. Libby is in the Kootenai National Forest, between the Cabinet Mountains to the south and the Purcell Mountains to the north, the town lies in the heart of the Kootenai Valley along the Kootenai River, and downstream from the Libby Dam. Libby is at an elevation of above sea level.

Libby experiences a continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;).

==Economy and environment==

Libby&#x27;s economy had been largely supported in the past by the use of natural resources, such as logging and mining. Mining and timber mills have since closed down. Tourism is playing an increasing role in the local economy. The Libby Dam is upstream from Libby, one of the Columbia River Treaty Dams, finished in 1975. Libby is known as the &quot;City of Eagles&quot;. Several eagle sculptures can be found around town, including a eagle at both ends of town.

In 1961, area volunteers opened the Turner Ski Area about 20 miles north of Libby. Owned by a nonprofit foundation, the Ski Area served around 4,600 visits per year in 2017/2018 and relies on volunteer hours and donations for most of its services. In the mid-1980s, a major ski resort was proposed for Great Northern Mountain, south of Libby. Discussions on land usage and wildlife reached the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Reserved Water, and ultimately the ski resort was not built.

Libby&#x27;s energy usage includes or potentially includes multiple renewable resources: biomass, hydroelectric, and solar. In 2008, a report found that wood pellet waste from nearby lumber mills could be used to produce several megawatts of electricity. The Flathead Electric Co-op began purchasing up to 2.5 megawatts of power from the F.H. Stoltze Land &amp; Lumber Company in 2013 with a twenty year contract, leading to the construction of &quot;a biomass-fueled electric generation facility at their plant near Columbia Falls.&quot; The Co-op &quot;receives Renewable Energy Credits.&quot; The city also generates and sells hydroelectric energy. In 2020, a statewide appraisal of Montana public schools&#x27; solar power potential, the Montana Community Solar Project, assessed Libby&#x27;s schools and found the buildings had good potential, but installing solar panels would be financially inefficient as the schools&#x27; &quot;electric demand charges [were] in the 92nd percentile when compared against the cohort of 25 schools.&quot;

===Vermiculite mine and asbestos contamination===
In 1919, vermiculite was discovered in the mountains near town. In 1963 W. R. Grace and Company bought the local mine, by which time it was producing 80% of the vermiculite in the world. Because the local vermiculite contains asbestos, and the mine&#x27;s byproducts were used in local buildings and landscaping, the town suffered from an extremely high rate of asbestosis. Nearly 10% of the population died from asbestos contamination, and the federal government later charged company officials for complicity. On May 8, 2009, W.R. Grace &amp; Co. was acquitted of charges that it knowingly harmed the people of Libby. It was also acquitted of subsequently participating in any cover-up. Fred Festa, chairman, president and CEO said in a statement, &quot;the company worked hard to keep the operations in compliance with the laws and standards of the day.&quot; In 2004, &quot;Libby, Montana&quot;, a documentary on the situation, was released.

On June 17, 2009, the EPA declared its first public health emergency, which covered Libby and nearby Troy. It had provided an additional $130 million in cleanup and medical assistance. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes a provision which provided Medicare coverage to individuals of such public health emergencies.
By 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was concluding the removal of asbestos-contaminated soils and other suspect materials in and near Libby and had spent $425 million in Superfund money on cleanup. That year, an EPA review of toxicity and risks found that the cleanups had managed asbestos exposure risk effectively. By the end of 2018, the EPA had removed &quot;more than one million cubic yards of contaminated soil,&quot; and area cleanup was completed that year, except for the location of the former mine, which is the disposal site of the contaminated soil. Contaminated construction materials were disposed of &quot;in a specially designed landfill cell.&quot; The remaining contamination is limited to the forests and property in or near the former mine, with cleanup plans pending and with controls for higher exposures during wildfire fighting.

In 2020, the EPA transferred control of the site to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. The same year, the local Center for Asbestos began offering testing for autoimmune markers for pleural disease, which would act as an early screen for at-risk patients.

=== Ground water contamination ===
A second EPA Superfund site is the Libby Ground Water Contamination site at a former lumber and plywood mill which ceased operations in 1969. The mill&#x27;s disposal practices and spills contaminated the soil, surface water, and groundwater with chemicals including pentachlorophenol, which the EPA discovered in nearby well water in 1979. Site reviews are held every five years, and as of 2020, several controls are in place to prevent contact with and consumption of contaminated materials.

==Education==
Public education in Libby is administered by the Libby School District. The district operates Libby Elementary School and Libby Middle-High School.

Libby Adventist Christian School and Kootenai Valley Christian School are private institutions.

Libby has a public library, a branch of the Lincoln County Public Libraries. Established in 1920 after residents petitioned the Board of County Commissioners, the county free library first operated out of the former Libby Woman’s Club building. The Woman&#x27;s Club had formerly sponsored a small library of two thousand books for Libby citizens, and members of the Woman’s Club voted to donate the collection to kickstart the new library&#x27;s circulating collection. The library moved buildings for the next few decades until its current building, the Inez R. Herrig building, was built in 1964. Branches were established in other county towns, and from 1956 to 1974, a bookmobile served smaller areas. The library now provides programming for children and adults and online services such as mobile data hotspots for borrowing.
Flathead Valley Community College offers courses through its Lincoln County Campus in Libby. This campus operates the Glacier Bank Adult Basic Education Learning Center &quot;where students can take free classes in preparation for their GED exams.&quot;

<text>Danville is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,408 at the 2020 census. Danville is part of the Timberlane Regional School District, with students attending Danville Elementary School, Timberlane Regional Middle School, and Timberlane Regional High School.

== History ==

In 1694 the parish of Kingstown (now Kingston) was incorporated, and it included the area known as &quot;Hawke&quot; as the westerly part of the parish. There were some families that lived in this region as early as the mid-1600s, but the first recorded settlements were about 1735. The meeting house in Kingstown was quite a distance for the residents of the westerly part of the parish to travel. Travel through this part of town was on roads which were little more than footpaths or bridleways that led from farm to farm. The residents of this westerly part of town built their own meeting house (the Old Meeting House) in 1755 and petitioned the Governor on January 2, 1760, to be set apart and to form their own parish. The petition was granted on February 22, 1760, and Hawke was incorporated. They sold pews in the Old Meeting House on June 23, 1760.

The Tuckertown smallpox epidemic, one of the most memorable and saddest events in Hawke&#x27;s history, occurred in the winter of 1781–1782. The Reverend John Page willingly went to the &quot;pest house&quot; to care for those afflicted, only to eventually succumb himself.

As the American Revolution ended, farming continued to be the primary livelihood, although the industrial age was slowly moving into rural Hawke. By 1828–1829 there were eight mills for various purposes known to exist. Travel was becoming more important, and from 1790 well into the mid-19th century the town allocated many sums of money for road building and repair. In 1800 it was the practice for a road builder (District Highway Surveyor, the predecessor to our road agents of today) to be granted authority to tax those the road would benefit. The tax was based on the amount of land owned as well as personal wealth. A person was allowed to work off the tax by providing physical labor or oxen and equipment to help with the road construction. In 1833, a warrant provided for &quot;a new highway in the south part of town&quot; that caused some controversy among the townsfolk, but was ultimately completed in 1835.

At the 1836 Town Meeting the original town name of &quot;Hawke&quot; (for the British Admiral Edward Hawke) was changed to &quot;Danville&quot;. No definitive explanation has been discovered for the reason for the change or explanation for also considering the name &quot;China&quot;.

In the decades leading up to the Civil War, Danville typified rural New England life. Most residents followed agricultural pursuits, although the keeping of orchards and animals began to decline. The impact of the Industrial Revolution was to make its mark especially in the area of home industries and small businesses. Sawmills, cooperages, blacksmithing and small home shoe shops provided extra income for farmers of Danville. Wagons loaded with casks and barrels left town for the port cities of Newburyport, Gloucester, and Salem, Massachusetts, while town
cordwainers complemented the shoe industry of Haverhill, Massachusetts, by sewing and lining the shoes that were eventually trimmed, dressed and packed in the nearby city.

Religion, which had been a prime factor in the establishment of Hawke, continued to influence the people. The only two churches in town were constructed in this time period. The Baptist Church was first organized as the Church of Christ in 1820. In 1832 the Free Will Baptist Society was organized, and Deacon Thomas Colby was authorized to build a church on the corner of Main Street and Kingston Road that was later moved to its present location next to Town Hall on Main Street. In 1850 the Union Religious Society built the only other church, other than the Meeting House, on Beach Plain Road.

== Geography ==

The highest named summit in Danville is Rock Rimmon Hill, with an elevation greater than above sea level on the town&#x27;s eastern border. An unnamed hill on the town&#x27;s western border also tops 350 feet. The southern two-thirds of Danville lies within the Merrimack River watershed, and the northern third is in the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed.

<text>Deerfield is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,855 at the 2020 census, up from 4,280 in 2010. Deerfield is the location of the annual Deerfield Fair.

== History ==
Deerfield was originally part of Nottingham. In 1756, residents petitioned for organization of a separate parish, but were denied. In 1765, while a second petition was pending, two local hunters presented colonial governor Benning Wentworth with a deer. Permission was granted, and &quot;Deerfield&quot; was incorporated in 1766. The incorporation act for Deerfield was signed by three members of the Leavitt family, including Capt. Samuel Leavitt who later was one of the town&#x27;s first selectmen. Leavitts Hill in Deerfield was named for the family, who had first settled in nearby Exeter.

&quot;Deerfield Parade&quot;, a hilltop district first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1740, was located on the early postal route between Concord and Portsmouth. Here, the militia of the Revolutionary and Civil wars trained and &quot;paraded&quot; on the village common. The &quot;Parade&quot; was then a professional, cultural and trade center. About 1798, citizens founded Deerfield Academy, a high school. It burned in 1842.

Once a thriving farm community which was disappointed when bypassed by railroads, the town in 1876 established the Deerfield Fair. Now billed as &quot;New England&#x27;s Oldest Family Fair&quot;, the four-day event draws huge crowds each autumn to admire animals, produce and crafts, or to enjoy amusement park rides.

== Geography ==
Deerfield is in southeastern New Hampshire, on the western side of Rockingham County. The town&#x27;s western border is the Merrimack County line. The highest point in Deerfield as well as in Rockingham County is the summit of Nottingham Mountain, at above sea level, near the town&#x27;s western border. Portions of the Pawtuckaway Mountains, including a small portion of Pawtuckaway State Park, are along the eastern border of the town. A part of Bear Brook State Park, including the campground area at Spruce Pond and Beaver Pond, is in the southwestern corner of the town.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.57% of the town. Deerfield is primarily drained by the Lamprey River and its tributary the North Branch River, within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed, while the western edge and northernmost section of town is in the Merrimack River watershed.

Deerfield Community School was opened in 1990 and replaced the George B. White School. The George B. White Building is now commercial space and houses, among other things, the town offices and the police department. Deerfield students have attended various local high schools over the years, as there is no high school in the town. Starting with the DCS graduating class of 1995, the town has sent students graduating from Deerfield Community School to Concord High School. Other options have included Coe-Brown Northwood Academy in Northwood, Central High School in Manchester, West High School in Manchester, Pembroke Academy in Pembroke, and Oyster River High School in Durham. The students graduating from Deerfield community school still continue to go to Concord high unless given opportunities to go to other schools.

== History ==

East Kingston was once a part of Kingston called &quot;Kingston East Parish&quot;, but was granted a separate charter in 1738 by Governor Jonathan Belcher. Several residents of East Kingston had petitioned Governor Belcher that its location was too distant from the Kingston school and place of worship.

The town grew up around the saw and grist mill at the Trickling Falls on the edge of Powwow Pond. Farms prospered on the good soil, and ice-cutting in the Powwow River was a thriving winter business before the age of refrigeration. The New England Brick Company was once a principal industry.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are water, comprising 0.56% of the town. The southern half of East Kingston is drained by the Powwow River, a tributary of the Merrimack River, while the remainder is drained by Great Brook, a tributary of the Exeter River, which ultimately drains to the Atlantic Ocean via Great Bay. A very small portion of Powwow Pond on the Powwow River lies within the town. Roughly the northern half of East Kingston lies within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed, with the southern half of town located in the Merrimack River watershed. The highest point in town is the summit of Morse Hill, at above sea level.

<doc id="124901" wikidata="Q646903" url="?curid=124901" title="Fremont, New Hampshire">
<text>Fremont is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,739 at the 2020 census, up from 4,283 at the 2010 census. Fremont is crossed by the Rockingham Recreation Trail (a rail trail) and NH Route 107.

==History==
Settled in the 1720s, Fremont was originally part of Exeter. The area was once famous for its heavy growth of high-quality eastern white pine trees, reserved for use as masts of the Royal Navy. But residents began to use the wood for home construction. When in 1734 David Dunbar, surveyor-general, visited the Copyhold Mill to inspect fallen lumber, local citizens assembled, discharged firearms, and convinced Dunbar to leave. Dunbar returned emboldened with 10 men, but was forced to flee to a local tavern after citizens disguised as Indians attacked them. This insurrection became known as the Mast Tree Riot.

The town was granted in 1764 by colonial governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Poplin&quot;. In 1853, Poplin petitioned the state legislature to change the name. In 1854, it became &quot;Fremont&quot; after General John C. Frémont, the first candidate of the Republican Party in the presidential election of 1856.

The town is noted for the unspoiled Fremont Meeting House, built in 1800 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1993. The town was once home to the largest brickyard in the state, producing five million bricks a year, and to the downtown Spaulding &amp; Frost Cooperage, established in 1874, one of the oldest operating wooden barrel manufacturers in the country.

===B-52 crash===
On August 10, 1959, a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress crashed in Fremont. The aircraft, serial number 54-2682, had departed Westover Air Force Base in Chicopee, Massachusetts. During flight at , the crew heard several loud bangs, the radar system became inoperative, and the plane began to vibrate. As the vibrations became more severe, the plane began to lose altitude, and the pilot ordered the crew to bail out at . The pilot remained with the aircraft for several additional minutes, then ejected. The plane crashed into Spruce Swamp at 2:50p.m. local time. The pilot and seven crew members all survived. The crash was attributed to a failure of the radome on the nose of the aircraft.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 1.30% of the town. The highest point in Fremont is an unnamed summit, with an elevation of above sea level, near the town&#x27;s western border. The town is drained by the Exeter River, except for the northernmost part which is drained by headwaters of the Piscassic River. Fremont lies fully within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed.

<text>Greenland is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,067 at the 2020 census, up from 3,549 at the 2010 census. It is drained by the Winnicut River and bounded on the northwest by Great Bay.

== History ==

One of the earliest settlements in the state, Greenland was a parish of Portsmouth (then called Strawbery Banke) operating in 1638. Captain Francis Champernowne moved from Strawbery Banke in 1640 and settled in the area of the present Portsmouth Country Club. Although it was originally to be called &quot;Canary&quot;, he would call his farm &quot;Greenland&quot;. His extensive landholdings included a farm which is now the town of Madbury, named for his ancestral home in Devon, England.

Residents requested and were granted a separate parish in 1706. In , Captain Samuel Weeks constructed a substantial brick house, thought to be the oldest brick house in New Hampshire still standing. It survived the 1755 Cape Ann earthquake. Only the beams that supported the structure were cracked during the quake. The Weeks House is denoted by a New Hampshire historical marker (number 113) along New Hampshire Route 33.

Greenland incorporated in 1721. The town annexed parts of Stratham in 1805 and 1847.

On September 1, 1824, the Marquis de Lafayette was received by the citizens of Greenland at a triumphal arch erected in front of the local hotel.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 21.29% of the town. The highest point in Greenland is Breakfast Hill, at above sea level, on the town&#x27;s border with Rye. Greenland is abutted by Great Bay to the north and is primarily drained by the Winnicut River. Greenland lies fully within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed.

<text>Hampton Falls is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,403 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Archaeological excavations have confirmed that what is now Hampton Falls has been occupied by humans for roughly 10,000 years. The first settlers were indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands.
The land of Hampton Falls was first settled by Europeans in 1638, the same time as Hampton, of which it was then a part. The settlement of Hampton joined Norfolk County, Massachusetts Colony, in 1643, along with Exeter, Dover, Portsmouth, Salisbury and Haverhill. The county existed until 1679, when the modern-day New Hampshire towns separated from the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Records indicate a building that became a church may have existed near where the Weare Monument now is in 1665, but when it was first built is unknown. It was not until 1709 that the town was officially established as the Third Parish of Hampton. The Third Parish originally consisted of all land south of the Taylor River and north of the New Hampshire/Massachusetts border, or the modern-day towns of Seabrook, Kensington, and Hampton Falls.

A meeting house was built shortly after, and Thomas Crosby became the town&#x27;s minister for the church. Forty-nine members of the Hampton Church were dismissed late in 1711 (see https://history.lanememoriallibrary.org/hampton/biog/bachilermarston.htm), only to become members of the new church in the Third Parish. Parish officers and a representative were chosen in 1718. The first town meeting was held and town records began that year also. The town received its grant as an independent town with the name &quot;Hampton falls&quot; in 1726, but was still referred to as a parish until the Revolutionary War. Those who did use its actual name in writing spelled it with a lowercase f until around the same time.

An attempt was made in 1732 to separate the western portion of Hampton Falls and make it a parish of Kingston. The proposal failed in a way, yet succeeded in another; the land was separated, but it did not become part of Kingston—in 1737 it became a town of its own, Kensington.

A disease known as the &quot;Throat Distemper&quot; (now thought to have been a malignant form of diphtheria) infected the town with its symptoms in 1735 and 1736. 214 people of Hampton Falls perished, 96 of them being under the age of ten. Only two homes in town were throat distemper free. It passed through the town again in 1754, with far fewer casualties, but still many.

Seventy-two people wanted Hampton Falls (which then included Seabrook and Kensington) to become a part of Massachusetts in 1739, including Meshech Weare, but the proposal failed in the end. In 1765, the Presbyterians of the town wanted to form a new parish in the southern portion of the town, where a church of their religion existed. A town meeting was held on December 30 when the rest of the villagers learned of the Presbyterians&#x27; plans, and it was decided that the town would be separated into two. The new parish was formed in 1768, and became incorporated under the name Seabrook shortly after. Hampton Falls was considered one of the leading manufacturing towns in the entire state of New Hampshire around the time of 1770.

A plan to unite Seabrook and portions of Hampton Falls was proposed in 1782. The town would have been called &quot;New Hampton Falls&quot;, but Hampton Falls was successful in making the proposal fail. In 1835, the town of Hampton Falls had a new meeting-house erected. Where in town it existed is unknown.

On the night between October 29 and 30 in 1827, an earthquake struck the small town. A flash of light from a fault in the southern region of the town occurred, with violent trembling shortly following. It caused at least three chimneys to collapse partially or completely, with several others cracked. A more severe earthquake had struck Hampton Falls on November 18, 1755.

On May 21, 2006, an F2 tornado formed in the town at around 6:30 p.m. EST. It was near Interstate 95 where it overturned a truck, leaving two injured men and a kayak in a tree.

==Education==

Currently, the Lincoln Akerman School is the only public school in town. But at one point, five public schools existed, the North, South, West, and two East schools. One of the East Schools, founded around the time of the Civil War, burned down in 1947 when its furnace exploded, and the Lincoln Akerman School replaced it in 1949. While a new school was being built, students had to travel to the neighboring town of Seabrook to attend school. The other East School was moved to an area near the new library. Another school was turned into a home, and another was crushed by a boulder one winter when students pushed it off a hill.

High school students attend Winnacunnet High School in the neighboring town of Hampton.

Heronfield Academy, a private Episcopal middle school, is located on Exeter Road on the border of Hampton Falls and Exeter.

===Lincoln Akerman School===

<text>Kingston is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population at the 2020 census was 6,202.

== History ==
Kingston was the fifth town to be established in New Hampshire. Originally, it was a part of Hampton. After King Philip&#x27;s War, the establishment of new settlements was made possible by peace treaties with the local Indian tribes and, in 1692, by geographical and jurisdictional agreements between the provinces of Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire. Consequently, certain residents of Hampton petitioned for a grant of a separate township to be created from the western part of Hampton. And so, in 1694, King William III of England granted a royal charter establishing the town of &quot;Kingstown&quot;, so named in honor of the King. Use of the title rather than the King&#x27;s name was common at the time. The original charter exists to this day.

===Historic district===

The Kingston historic district encompasses the town center of Kingston. Historic buildings and sites within the district include the Kingston town hall; the Josiah Bartlett House, home of the second signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence; the First Universalist Church; the Sanborn Seminary; the Nichols Memorial Research Library; the Kingston Historical Museum (housed in the town&#x27;s first fire house); The 1686 House restaurant; the Masonic building; the Cemetery at the Plains (where Josiah Bartlett is buried); the Church on the Plains; and the Grace Daley House and barn, home to the town&#x27;s first church-owned parsonage (1835).

===West Kingston===

West Kingston is located along the road to Danville, in the western section of town, southwest of Great Pond. Evidence of the early inhabitants was manifested by the construction of a log garrison house on the present Great Pond Road. This well-built house consisted of two large rooms downstairs and a huge open chamber on the second floor. In later years a small ell was attached to the north side. The historic house was demolished at the beginning of the 20th century. The stone step at the main entrance and what must have been the &quot;cellar hole&quot; of this dwelling are still visible.

In the midst of an agrarian society, the charcoal manufacturing industry took root and became a major business in West Kingston. Charcoal was carried by horse-drawn wagons to the Massachusetts cities of Haverhill, Lawrence, North Andover, Newburyport, Lowell, and Amesbury, as well as to Exeter, New Hampshire. Some was sold by street peddlers to be used in homes for the purpose of kindling fires. A great deal was also used by the large machine shops and by the silversmiths.

Many individuals manufactured shoes in their small, one-room shoe shops. Such a shop stood until recently near the Thomas Page residence. Some people sewed shoes in their own homes. Unlike the large-scale factories of today, concerned with mass production, these enterprises constructed the whole shoe, hand-sewing it with an artisan&#x27;s touch.

A cooper shop on the Wadleigh Farm produced barrels made entirely of wood: the staves were made of pine and hardwoods, and were bound with hoops of birch. Skilled workers made hooks to hold hoops together. When a sufficient number of barrels was collected, the men hauled them to Newburyport to be sold - probably to be used by fishermen in packing fish.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Kingston has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 5.90% of the town. The highest point in Kingston is the east summit of Rock Rimmon Hill, at about above sea level, on the town&#x27;s border with Danville to the west. The majority of the town is drained by the Powwow River, a tributary of the Merrimack. The northern portion of town is drained by the Little River, part of the Exeter River/Piscataqua River watershed.

<text>New Castle is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,000 at the 2020 census. It is the easternmost town in New Hampshire and the smallest by area, and it is the only town in the state located entirely on islands. It is home to Fort Constitution Historic Site, Fort Stark Historic Site, and the New Castle Common, a recreation area on the Atlantic Ocean. New Castle is also home to a United States Coast Guard station, as well as the historic Wentworth by the Sea hotel.

== History ==
The main island on which the town sits is the largest of several at the mouth of the Piscataqua River and was originally called &quot;Great Island&quot;. Settled in 1623, an earthwork defense was built on Fort Point which would evolve into Fort William and Mary (rebuilt in 1808 as Fort Constitution). Chartered in 1679 as a parish of Portsmouth, it was incorporated on May 30, 1693, and was named &quot;New Castle&quot; after the fort. Until 1719 it included Rye, then called &quot;Sandy Beach&quot;, which was set off as a parish. The principal industries were trade, tavern-keeping, and fishing. There was also agriculture, using the abundant seaweed as fertilizer.

Beginning on June 11, 1682, Great Island experienced a supernatural event—a lithobolia, or &quot;Stone-Throwing Devil&quot;, recorded in a 1698 London pamphlet by Richard Chamberlain. On a Sunday night at about 10 o&#x27;clock, the tavern home of George Walton, an early settler and planter, was showered with stones thrown &quot;by an invisible hand&quot;. Windows were smashed, and the spit in the fireplace leapt into the air, then came down with its point stuck in the back log. When a member of the household retrieved the spit, it flew out the window of its own accord. The gate outside was discovered off its hinges. Rev. Cotton Mather took an interest in the phenomenon, reporting that:

:&quot;This disturbance continued from day to day; and sometimes a dismal hollow whistling would be heard, and sometimes the trotting and snorting of a horse, but nothing to be seen... A man was much hurt by some of the stones. He was a Quaker, and suspected that a woman, who charged him with injustice in detaining some land from her did, by witchcraft, occasion these preternatural occurrences. However, at last they came to an end.&quot;

The &quot;Stone-Throwing Devil&quot; created quite a sensation on Great Island. Hundreds of stones mysteriously rained down on George Walton&#x27;s tavern, as well as onto him and others in the area over the entire summer. Yet no one ever came forward who saw anyone throwing the stones. Many other mysterious events also occurred at that time. Demonic voices were heard, and items were flung about inside Walton&#x27;s tavern. Prominent Boston minister Increase Mather described the strange events in his book &quot;Illustrious Providences.&quot;

George Walton, who was in a property boundary dispute with his neighbor, accused her of witchcraft. She, in turn, accused him of being a wizard. Others in the area may also have had reasons to throw stones at Walton. He was a Quaker. Quakers were looked upon with great suspicion by Puritans, and just being a Quaker was a crime. Walton was a successful innkeeper, merchant, and lumberman, and became the largest landowner on the island. Walton was envied by his less industrious neighbors. He was involved in a number of lawsuits over business and property disputes. He also had two Native American employees, which would have caused great concern so soon after war with the Indians (King Philip&#x27;s War) and because of the uneasy peace that existed. His tavern customers included a variety of rowdy outsiders, including &quot;godless&quot; fishermen, who were considered undesirables by others on the island. Regardless of what caused Walton and his inn to be the victim of a months-long rain of stones, it was the first major outbreak of apparent witchcraft in America.

News of it traveled throughout America and England. Within a few years, accusations of witchcraft would occur in other New England towns, culminating in the famous witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts.

Fort William and Mary was the site of one of the first acts of the American Revolution. On the afternoon of December 14, 1774, colonists arrived aboard gundalows (sailing barges) and raided the fort. Severely outnumbered, Captain John Cochran and the fort&#x27;s five soldiers surrendered, whereupon the rebels loaded onto a boat 100 barrels of gunpowder. The boat was floated up the Piscataqua River and the powder offloaded for transport to inland towns, including Durham, where the ammunition was stored in the cellar of the Congregational church. The next day, the colonists returned to the fort and removed 16 of the lighter cannon and all small arms. The gunpowder was used at the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill.

A new route to the island was created in 1821 when three bridges (now two bridges and a causeway) connected Frame Point in Portsmouth with the northwestern corner of Great Island. Previously, a bridge on the southwestern point had been the only way to reach New Castle without a boat. The community was then an overlooked fishing village, which helped preserve its colonial architecture. However, in 1874 the Hotel Wentworth was built atop a hill with a view of Little Harbor and the ocean. After early financial difficulties, the establishment was purchased and elaborately refurbished in Second Empire style by Portsmouth alemaker and hotelier Frank Jones. It became the area&#x27;s most fashionable resort, growing in size until it was a village unto itself. When President Theodore Roosevelt mediated the 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth to end the Russo-Japanese War, envoys from both countries stayed at the Wentworth by the Sea, ferried by launch to negotiations held at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The hotel was a setting for the 1999 movie, &quot;In Dreams&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 64.4% of the town. New Castle occupies an archipelago, consisting of one main island (Great Island) and several smaller islands surrounded by the Piscataqua River and Atlantic Ocean. The main channel of the Piscataqua passes around the north and east sides of Great Island, while Little Harbor is to the south and the smaller islands within Portsmouth Harbor are to the west. The southeastern end of the island, at Fort Stark, faces the Atlantic. The highest point of land is at the Wentworth by the Sea hotel, where the elevation reaches above sea level.

<text>Newfields is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,769 at the 2020 census. The primary village in town, where 378 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Newfields census-designated place (CDP) and is located along New Hampshire Route 85 and the Squamscott River. It is a quaint village of handsome old houses.

Newfields is one of New Hampshire&#x27;s wealthiest towns, with a median household income of $154,375 for the period 2015-19.

== History ==
Incorporated in 1849, Newfields was part of Exeter until 1727, when it became part of Newmarket. Settled in 1638, it was called &quot;Newfield Village&quot; as early as 1681, and later &quot;South Newmarket&quot;, a parish of that town.

The name &quot;Newfields&quot; was not used by census takers until 1900. Previously, it was listed as &quot;South New Market&quot; (1850), &quot;South Newmarket&quot; (1860 and 1880), or simply as &quot;Newmarket&quot; (1870).

Garrison houses, built as protection against Indian attack, were not uncommon. Among the earliest tithingmen in the village were Jonathan Robinson (1678), Abraham and Jeremiah Folsom (1720), Andrew Glidden (1721), Trueworthy Leavitt (1725), Samuel Edgerly (1728), Nathaniel Gilman (1729) and Nathaniel Webster (1729).

In 1775, a bridge was built across the Squamscott River connecting the community with Stratham. This shortened the journey to Exeter, established that year as the Revolutionary capital. But the new route bypassed the center of town, built on either side of an ancient Squamscot Indian trail. This preserved old Newfields.

Wesleyan Academy was established here in 1817, a Methodist school of five boys and five girls under the tutelage of Reverend John Brodhead and others. Coeducation was then rather an advanced concept. Unfortunately, the academy struggled financially from the start because of, as administrators would conclude, &quot;...its location in a setting of relatively few Methodists, of limited means...&quot; And so, in 1825, it moved to Wilbraham, Massachusetts. The academy&#x27;s site is now occupied by the Newfields Elementary School, with about 170 children as of 2011, from grades K–5.

In 1841, the Boston and Maine Railroad extended service to the community. In 1880, Dr. John M. Brodhead presented his own library and $10,000 to the town on condition that it be renamed &quot;Newfields&quot;. The town was so incorporated in 1895.

<doc id="124910" wikidata="Q589768" url="?curid=124910" title="Newington, New Hampshire">
<text>Newington is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 811 at the 2020 census. It is bounded to the west by Great Bay, to the northwest by Little Bay and to the northeast by the Piscataqua River. 

Newington is home to Portsmouth International Airport at Pease (formerly Pease Air Force Base) and to the New Hampshire Air National Guard. The Old Town Center Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Originally a part of Dover, boundary disputes among early river settlers caused this area to be called &quot;Bloody Point&quot;. By 1640, Trickey&#x27;s Ferry operated between Bloody Point and Hilton&#x27;s Point in Dover. In 1712, the meetinghouse was erected and the parish set off, named &quot;Newington&quot; for an English village, whose residents sent the bell for the meetinghouse. Behind the meetinghouse is a row of horse sheds, once commonplace. About 1725, the parsonage was built near the Town Forest, considered one of the oldest in the United States. 

The town was incorporated in 1764 by colonial governor Benning Wentworth. In 1794, a bridge was completed across Little Bay from Fox Point in Newington to the south bank of the Bellamy River in Dover, by way of Goat Island—a major engineering feat in its day.

=== 20th century ===
In 1952, the House Armed Services Committee authorized acquiring by eminent domain large tracts to create Pease Air Force Base, which opened on June 30, 1956. Approximately 60% of the installation lay in Newington, including land in the town&#x27;s center, and 40% was in neighboring Portsmouth. It would be, however, the first base recommended to be closed by the 1988 Commission on Base Realignment and Closure. 
Military personnel in 1990 began leaving the base, which officially closed on March 31, 1991. Although the Air National Guard retained some property, the old base has been intensely redeveloped, primarily in the Portsmouth section, as the Pease International Tradeport, a business park.

In the 1970s and 1980s, commercial development from Portsmouth spread into Newington. The Newington Mall opened in the 1970s (replaced by the Crossings at Fox Run in the 2000s), followed by the Fox Run Mall.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 34.5% of the town. The highest elevation in Newington is above sea level, near Newington Cemetery in the center of town.

The town is crossed by U.S. Route 4 and New Hampshire Route 16.

At one time, the town had 17 watermills in operation.

Nottingham once included Deerfield, incorporated in 1766, and Northwood, in 1773.

Four Revolutionary War generals were from Nottingham: Joseph Cilley, Henry Dearborn, Henry Butler, and Thomas Bartlett.

Local businesses and numerous large chain stores are located along Route 125, which has become known for problems with heavy traffic during weekday commuting and weekend shopping hours. Route 125 intersects with Interstate 495 in Massachusetts south of the center of Plaistow.

Route 121A (Main Street) runs north to south through the center of Plaistow, as a local route. It crosses NH 125 north of the center of town and terminates at the Massachusetts border, where the road continues south for a few yards before terminating at Massachusetts Route 125. NH 121A leads north through East Hampstead and Sandown to Chester. New Hampshire Route 108 runs north to south along the eastern edge of Plaistow, just west of the Massachusetts border.

It leads west into Atkinson and terminates to the southeast at the Massachusetts border, where the road continues into Haverhill as North Main Street.

Pan Am Railways (formerly the Boston and Maine Railroad) operates the main railroad line from Boston to Portland, Maine, which is utilized by Amtrak and by freight trains, running through Plaistow. Passenger stations for the Amtrak &quot;Downeaster&quot; are available in Haverhill to the south and Exeter to the north. A proposal to extend existing MBTA commuter rail service from Boston through Haverhill into Plaistow concluded in 2015 with the decision not to extend the route at this time.

MVRTA bus 13 runs from the center of Haverhill to Wal-Mart on Route 125.

<text>Rye is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,543 at the 2020 census. The town is home to several state parks along the Atlantic coastline.

==History==
The first settlement in New Hampshire, originally named Pannaway Plantation, was established in 1623 at Odiorne&#x27;s Point by a group of fishermen led by David Thompson. The settlement was abandoned in favor of Strawbery Banke, which became Portsmouth. The first settler in present-day Rye was probably William Berry. Prior to its incorporation in 1726 as a parish of New Castle, Rye was called &quot;Sandy Beach&quot; and its lands were once parts of New Castle, Portsmouth, Greenland and Hampton. In 1726, the town of New Castle set off a parish for Sandy Beach called &quot;Rye&quot;, for Rye in Sussex, England, the ancestral lands of the Jenness family who continue to live in the town to this day and even have a beach named after them. The town was incorporated in 1785. In 2013, a researcher pointed out that the town seal showed the parish creation date of 1726 as the incorporation date. Later on in the year, the seal was updated to include the three dates important to Rye, 1623, 1726 and 1785.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 65.63% of the town. The town is located on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and includes four of the nine islands known as the Isles of Shoals, which lie approximately out from the mainland. The highest point in Rye is the summit of Breakfast Hill, at above sea level, on the town&#x27;s border with Greenland.

State parks in Rye along the Atlantic shoreline include (from south to north) Jenness State Beach, Rye Harbor State Park, Wallis Sands State Beach, and Odiorne Point State Park, home to the Seacoast Science Center.

Route 1A, going north-south, follows the coast. Short segments of U.S. Route 1 and Route 1B pass through Rye. The nearest major highway is I-95, with the closest two exits in Hampton and Portsmouth. The nearest commercial airport is Portsmouth International Airport at Pease; the two closest major airports are Logan Airport in Boston and Portland International Jetport in Maine.

The village of Rye Beach is in the southern part of the town. Rye Beach has its own U.S. post office, as well as its own zoning enforcement and planning regulations.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 5,298 people, 2,252 households, and 1,531 families residing in the town. There were 2,852 housing units, of which 600, or 21.0%, were vacant. 471 of the vacant units were for seasonal or vacation use.

Of all households, 25.4% were made up of individuals, and 10.9% were someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.34, and the average family size was 2.80.

In the town, 20.3% of the population were under the age of 18, 4.3% were from 18 to 24, 18.2% from 25 to 44, 37.5% from 45 to 64, and 19.7% were 65 years of age or older.

As of September 1, 2021, 1,733 registered voters in Rye were registered as Democrats with 1,552 and 1,453 being registered as Republicans and undeclared, respectively.

In August 2001, a group of townspeople from Newington and Rye made a plea in protest to the state legislature to consider allowing the town to secede from the state due to disproportionate property tax laws which had been passed by the state in 1997 to balance the state&#x27;s education economy. The dispute was largely quelled by the lack of support for the movement, as only 52 of Newington&#x27;s 700+ (and 100 of Rye&#x27;s 5,000) residents signed the petition. The property tax issue itself quieted as Governor Craig Benson announced in 2003 the property taxes would be cut almost by half by 2008.

==Education==
Children who live in Rye can attend public schools in town from kindergarten through eighth grade. School Administrative Unit 50 (SAU-50) is the school district that serves Rye, as well as the towns of Greenland, Newington, and New Castle. High school students from Rye attend Portsmouth High School.

Rye Elementary School is home to kindergarten through fifth grade and is the first and largest school students from Rye will attend in SAU-50. All grades are co-ed and the school has an 11 to 1 student per teacher ratio with three hundred and thirty students enrolled in October 2013. Rye Junior High handles grades six, seven, and eight.

<text>Salem is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 30,089 at the 2020 census and an estimated 30,647 in 2022. Salem is a northern suburb of Boston located on Interstate 93. As the first town along I-93 northbound in New Hampshire, which lacks any state sales tax, Salem has grown into a regional commercial hub for the northern section of Greater Boston, anchored by the Mall at Rockingham Park and Tuscan Village. Other major sites include Canobie Lake Park, a large amusement park; and America&#x27;s Stonehenge, a stone structure of disputed origins. It is the former home of Rockingham Park, a horse racetrack. The Sununu political family hails from Salem, including former New Hampshire governor and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, and his sons John E. Sununu, a former U.S. senator, and Chris Sununu, former New Hampshire governor.

Salem was named on the &quot;Money&quot; website&#x27;s &quot;Best Places to Live 2020&quot; list.

== History ==
The area was first settled in 1652. As early as 1736, Salem was the &quot;North Parish&quot; of Methuen, Massachusetts, or &quot;Methuen District&quot;. In 1741, when the boundary line between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was fixed, the &quot;North Parish&quot; became part of New Hampshire, and was given the name &quot;Salem&quot;, taken from nearby Salem, Massachusetts. The town was incorporated in 1750 by colonial governor Benning Wentworth. The meetinghouse of the old north parish, erected in 1738, still stands, eventually becoming the town hall of Salem before it was turned into the Salem Historical Society museum.

In 1902, Canobie Lake Park was established in Salem by the Massachusetts Northeast Street Railway Company to encourage leisure excursions on its trolleys. The plan was successful, and the enterprise quickly became one of the leading resorts of its type in New England. Crowds arrived from all over, including the nearby mill towns of Haverhill, Lawrence, Lowell and Methuen in Massachusetts, and Manchester and Nashua in New Hampshire. Factory workers and others found respite strolling along tree-lined promenades, between flower beds or beside the lake. Rides, arcades, and a dance hall provided lively entertainments. The rise of the automobile, however, brought the decline of the trolley. But Canobie Lake Park, one of the few former street railway amusement resorts still in existence, continues to be popular.

Other features of Salem&#x27;s tourism history include America&#x27;s Stonehenge, a curiosity (formerly &quot;Mystery Hill&quot;). Other attractions include the Icenter, a skating arena, as well as Field of Dreams and Hedgehog Pond Park.

Starting in the 1950s, Salem developed rapidly as part of Greater Boston, with suburban-style residential neighborhoods and a long strip of commercial development along NH Route 28. Commercial construction has continued to focus on Route 28, as well as on the commercial zone off Exit 2 on Interstate 93. Starting in 2017, the Tuscan Village complex has been under construction, a multi-million dollar mixed-use commercial property that includes retail, medical offices, condos, and apartments. The complex is being built on the site of the former Rockingham Park race track.

The Manchester and Lawrence branch of the Boston and Maine Railroad ran through Salem until 2001. In 2009, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation commissioned a study exploring the reactivation of the branch and instituting commuter rail service connecting to the MBTA Haverhill Line and onward to Boston. The study&#x27;s cost/benefit analysis recommended taking no action to reactivate beyond preserving the option for consideration at a future time.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 4.07% of the town. Salem is drained by the Spicket River and its tributary Policy Brook, part of the Merrimack River watershed. Canobie Lake is on the western boundary, Arlington Mill Reservoir is in the north, and World End Pond is in the southeast. None of the town&#x27;s residential water supply incorporates sodium fluoride, a water additive that helps ensure strong teeth enamel. The highest point in Salem is the summit of Gordon&#x27;s Hill, at above sea level, along the town&#x27;s western border.

Salem is the first New Hampshire town encountered when traveling north from Massachusetts on Interstate 93. The interstate&#x27;s first two New Hampshire exits are within the town. Via I-93, Boston is to the south and Manchester is to the northwest.

== Fireworks ==
Due to its location along I-95 on the Massachusetts-New Hampshire border, Seabrook has many fireworks and fireworks supply stores; consumer fireworks are legal in New Hampshire, whereas in Massachusetts, they are illegal and cannot be purchased. This creates a demand for fireworks in border towns like Seabrook, to the point where Massachusetts State Police have entered New Hampshire in efforts to crack down on transport of fireworks back over the border.

<text>South Hampton is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 894 at the 2020 census. South Hampton is home to Cowden State Forest and Powwow River State Forest.

== History ==
South Hampton was one of the first towns granted by colonial governor Benning Wentworth after the separation of the governorships of New Hampshire and Massachusetts in 1741. The border between the two colonies was fixed, and consequently South Hampton would be chartered in 1742 from former parts of Amesbury and Salisbury, Massachusetts. Over the years, the town lost territory to Hampton Falls, Seabrook and Newton, but gained territory from East Kingston in 1824. Though it was once part of the larger town of Hampton (as were the also separate towns of Hampton Falls and North Hampton), it no longer borders its namesake town due to these border changes.

The town&#x27;s Justices of the Peace in 1831 were Parker Merrill, George W. Pillsbury, Benning Leavitt, John Palmer and A. Brown.

At one time, the town was home to over twelve different religious sects. One of South Hampton&#x27;s only members of the New Hampshire State Senate was Benjamin Barnard, who served from 1806 to 1808.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are water, comprising 0.31% of the town. South Hampton is drained by the Powwow River, part of the Merrimack River watershed. The highest point in town is the summit of Chair Hill, at above sea level, near the eastern end of town.

Routes 107A and 150 go through South Hampton. The nearest Interstate is Interstate 495 in Amesbury, Massachusetts, one town to the south.

<text>Stratham is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The town had a population of 7,669 at the 2020 census. It is bounded on the west by the Squamscott River. The town is the home of the only U.S. Lindt &amp; Sprüngli factory and the headquarters of the Timberland Corporation.

== History ==

Stratham was settled in 1631 and incorporated in 1716. The area, called &quot;Winnicutt&quot; by the Pennacook people, was known as &quot;Squamscott Patent&quot; or &quot;Point of Rocks&quot; because of its location between Great Bay and the Squamscott River. The sixth town in the colony to be incorporated, the town was named for Wriothesley Russell, Baron Howland of Streatham, a friend of New Hampshire Royal Governor Samuel Shute.

The town is unusual among New England settlements of its size in having been comprehensively mapped in 1793 by Phinehas Merrill. It is therefore possible to identify how many of the extant buildings of the town predate the map.

Each summer since 1967, the town hosts the Stratham Fair, held at Stratham Hill Park. However, the fair has been canceled each year since 2020, initially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is unlikely to return due to net operating losses in its final year and outdated equipment and infrastructure.

The town has multiple properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the John Crockett House, Emery Farm, and original Wiggin Memorial Library building.

==Geography==

Most of Stratham is drained by the Squamscott River, a north-flowing tributary of Great Bay. The east side of the town drains to the Winnicut River, which also flows to Great Bay. The entire town is part of the Piscataqua River watershed. The highest elevation in town is above sea level, found on the summits of Stratham Hill and neighboring Jewell Hill, both glacial drumlins.

Stratham Hill Park and nearby Gordon Barker Town Forest offer a combined trail system for hikers and mountain bikers.

Stratham is crossed by New Hampshire Routes 33, 108 and 111. Additionally, the New Hampshire Route 101 expressway passes through the southern portion of town.

<text>Windham is a suburban town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population at the 2020 census was 15,817, up from 13,592 in 2010.

== History ==

The area was initially home to the Pawtucket Native Americans. Scots-Irish immigrants began to settle in the area in 1719. The region was known as &quot;Nutfield,&quot; and included what are now the neighboring towns of Derry and Londonderry. By 1721, some of the original settlers petitioned to form a separate independent community. Governor Benning Wentworth granted this request in 1742. One published theory holds that the community&#x27;s name refers to Windham, Ireland, harkening back to the petitioners&#x27; homeland. However, it has been alternatively postulated that the town was named after Sir Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont, a member of Parliament from 1734 to 1750, Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1761 to 1763, and a good friend of Governor Wentworth. The town of Windham was originally a parish of Londonderry. Windham was the second town designated by Governor Benning Wentworth following the establishment of the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border. The first census ever taken in Windham reported 663 residents in 1790.
Historic landmarks in Windham include the Searles School and Chapel, Searles Castle, the town center, and the Armstrong Memorial Building. Searles Castle is one of Windham&#x27;s most prominent landmarks. Edward Francis Searles, an interior decorator and antique collector, built the castle. The architect, Henry Vaughn, modeled the castle&#x27;s architecture after the style of the Stanton Harcourt Manor in Oxfordshire, England. The building was completed in 1915 at a cost of over $1,250,000. The castle contains over 20 rooms and is available to the public to be rented out for functions and events. In July 1909, Mr. Searles erected a commemorative plaque honoring Governor Dinsmoor &quot;a few rods&quot; from his birthplace on Jenny&#x27;s Hill, which stands today as a designated historic landmark.
In 2021, Windham attracted attention in the wake of the attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 United States presidential election. Following the concurrent 2020 election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, a Democratic candidate who lost her race by 24 votes requested a recount, only for the margin of victory for four Republican candidates to unexpectedly increase by 300 votes each. The results of the recount prompted the New Hampshire General Court to authorize an audit of Windham&#x27;s ballot counting machines and hand tabulations. When Windham declined to select an auditor endorsed by supporters of President Donald Trump, about 500 supporters marched at a town board meeting, protesting alleged incidents of fraud and forcing the meeting to be moved to a local high school. Trump and his adviser, Windham resident Corey Lewandowski, also commented on the controversial audit. CNN reported that Trump supporters saw the audit as an opportunity to prove broader election integrity problems during the 2020 elections. The auditors said their assessments revealed no signs of fraud but rather &quot;a confluence of errors.&quot;

<text>Barrington is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 9,326 at the 2020 census, up from 8,576 at the 2010 census. The town is a woodland, farm and commuter town.

==History==

Barrington was incorporated in 1722 and named for Samuel Shute of Barrington Hall, colonial governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. His brother was John Shute Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington.

The town was made up of two grants, the first containing all of Strafford and present-day Barrington except for a parcel wide called New Portsmouth, or the Two Mile Streak. This second grant had been set aside to provide fuel and home sites for imported workers at the Lamprey River Iron Works, chartered in 1719 by the Massachusetts General Court to encourage industrial development in the province.

Slow at first to be settled because of rocky soil, Barrington by 1810 had 3,564 residents, then the state&#x27;s third largest town, its primary industry the smelting of iron ore. The Isinglass River, together with its tributaries, provided water power for grist, fulling and saw mills. In 1820, Strafford was set off from Barrington, reducing its land area by about half, because of lengthy travel required to attend town meetings.

In 1882, the Reverend Alonzo Hall Quint wrote:

:&quot;Of those towns in the state whose scenery is somewhat quiet, one of the most beautiful is Barrington.&quot;

Indeed, the town&#x27;s attractive natural features, including rivers, brooks, waterfalls and not less than 14 ponds, are summarized by the name of a summit, Beauty Hill. Barrington is bisected by the Calef Highway (New Hampshire Route 125), named for a state senator from the 1800s whose family also founded in 1869 a locally famous general store that remains in operation.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 4.05% of the town. Barrington is drained by the Isinglass River and Bellamy River. Swains Lake and Mendum&#x27;s Pond are in the south. The highest point in town is an unnamed summit near its western border, measuring above sea level. The highest named summit is Bumfagging Hill, at . Barrington lies fully within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed.

The commercial center of town is the village of East Barrington, centered on the junction of state routes 9 and 125.

<text>Dover is a city in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 32,741 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous city in the New Hampshire Seacoast region and the fifth most populous city in New Hampshire.

It is the county seat of Strafford County, and home to Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, the Woodman Institute Museum, and the Children&#x27;s Museum of New Hampshire.

==Etymology==
The city is named for Dover, Kent, England. First recorded in its Latinised form of &quot;Portus Dubris&quot;, the word &quot;Dover&quot; derives from the Brythonic word for &quot;waters&quot; (&quot;dwfr&quot; in Middle Welsh). The same element is present in the word&#x27;s French (&quot;Douvres&quot;) and Modern Welsh (&quot;Dofr&quot;) forms.

==History==

===Settlement===

The first known European to explore the region was Martin Pring from Bristol, England, in 1603.

In 1623, brothers William and Edward Hilton settled at Pomeroy Cove on Dover Point, near the confluence of the Bellamy and Piscataqua rivers. This first settlement makes Dover the oldest permanent settlement in New Hampshire, and seventh in the United States.

The Hiltons were fishmongers sent from London by the Council for New England&#x27;s Laconia Company to establish a colony and fishery on the Piscataqua. In 1631, however, the colony contained only three houses. William Hilton built a salt works on the property (salt-making was the principal industry in his hometown of Northwich, England). He also served as Deputy to the General Court (the colonial legislature). The Hiltons&#x27; name survives at Hilton Park on Dover Point (originally known as Hilton Point).

The colony&#x27;s original townships included Durham, Madbury, Newington, Lee, Somersworth and Rollinsford.

In 1633, the plantation was bought by a group of English Puritans who planned to settle in New England, including Viscount Saye and Sele, Baron Brooke and John Pym. They promoted colonization in America, and so that year Hilton&#x27;s Point received numerous immigrants, many from Bristol. They renamed the settlement Bristol. Atop the nearby hill they built a meetinghouse surrounded by an entrenchment, with a jail nearby.

The town was called Dover in 1637 by the new governor, Reverend George Burdett. It was possibly named after Robert Dover, an English lawyer who resisted Puritanism. With the 1639 arrival of Thomas Larkham, however, it was renamed after Northam in Devon, where he had been preacher. But Lord Saye and Sele&#x27;s group lost interest in their settlements, both here and at Saybrook, Connecticut, when their plan to establish a hereditary aristocracy in the colonies met disfavor in New England. Consequently, the plantation was sold in 1641 to Massachusetts and again named Dover.

Because it was an early settlement in Abenaki lands, settlers built fortified log houses called garrisons, inspiring Dover&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Garrison City.&quot; The population and business center shifted from Dover Point to Cochecho Falls on the Cochecho River, where its drop of providing water power for industry (Cochecho means &quot;the rapid foaming water&quot; in the Abenaki language). What is now downtown Dover settlers called Cochecho village.

===Cochecho Massacre===

On June 28, 1689, Dover suffered a devastating attack by Native Americans. It was revenge for an incident on September 7, 1676, when 400 Native Americans were tricked by Major Richard Waldron into performing a &quot;mock battle&quot; near Cochecho Falls. After discharging their weapons, the Native American warriors were captured. Half were sent to Massachusetts for predations committed during King Philip&#x27;s War, and seven or eight were hanged, and others were sold into slavery. Local Native Americans deemed innocent were released, but considered the deception a dishonorable breach of hospitality. Thirteen years passed. When colonists thought the episode forgotten, they struck. Fifty-two colonists, a quarter of the population, were either captured or slain.

Incursions against the frontier town would continue for the next half century. During Father Rale&#x27;s War, in August and September 1723, there were Indian raids on Saco, Maine, and Dover, New Hampshire. The following year Dover was raided again and Elizabeth Hanson wrote her captivity narrative.

===Mill era===

Located at the head of navigation, Cochecho Falls brought the Industrial Revolution to 19th-century Dover in a big way. But cotton textile manufacturing actually began about two miles upstream with the Dover Cotton Factory, which was incorporated in 1812, its mill built in 1815. The business would move to Cochecho Falls when it acquired water privileges occupied since the 17th century by sawmills and gristmills. In 1823 it was renamed the Dover Manufacturing Company, but was not successful. So in 1827 the Cocheco Manufacturing Company was founded (the misspelling a clerical error at incorporation), and the next year, the mill was the site of the first women&#x27;s strike in the United States. &quot;The Strike of the Mill Girls&quot; took place on December 30, 1828, when about half of the 800 women employed at the mill walked out over lower wages and longer hours that the new owners had implemented. Expansive brick mills were constructed downtown, linked to receive cotton bales and ship finished cloth when the railroad arrived in 1842. Incorporated as a city in 1855, Dover for a time became a leading national producer of textiles, the mill complex dominating the riverfront and employing 2,000 workers.

The mills were purchased in 1909 by the Pacific Mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts, which closed the printery in 1913 but continued spinning and weaving. The printery buildings were demolished in 1913, their site is now Henry Law Park.

In 1922, it was affected by the 1922 New England Textile Strike, shutting down the mills in the city over an attempted wage cut and hours increase.

During the Great Depression, however, textile mills no longer dependent on New England water power began moving to southern states in search of cheaper operating conditions, or simply went out of business. Dover&#x27;s millyard shut in 1937, then was bought at auction in 1941 by the city itself for $54,000. There were no other bids. Now called the Cocheco Falls Millworks, its tenants include technology and government services companies, plus a restaurant, brewery and bar.

Textile manufacturing in Dover wasn&#x27;t limited to cotton. In 1824, Alfred I. Sawyer established the Sawyer Woolen Mills beside the Bellamy River. It would expand to include 15 major buildings over , and by 1883 was the largest woolen manufacturer in the state. In 1889 it was acquired by the American Woolen Company, but closed and was sold off in 1955. The buildings have been repurposed into housing.

=== Modern era ===
With the closing of the mills, the downtown area of Dover sat vacant and lifeless for a long time. With the turn of the century, the city government began to revitalize the area. The Children&#x27;s Museum of New Hampshire was brought into a disused mill building with a lease of $1 a year. Henry Law Park, a grassy waterfront stretch of land, was given a brand new playground. Small businesses moved into the mills, such as restaurants, toy stores, real estate offices, and barber shops. Old buildings have been refurbished or outright rebuilt to provide new housing. An $87.5 million high school was built to handle the influx of new residents retreating from the high housing prices in Portsmouth. Recently, a plan to develop the waterfront on the other side of the river from the traditional downtown area was approved for $6 million. In early May 2021, waypoint signs were sporadically added to help drivers and walkers navigate Dover with the expansions that are underway.

<text>Lee is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,520 at the 2020 census. The town is a rural farm and bedroom community, being close to the University of New Hampshire.

== History ==

Lee was first settled by Europeans in 1657 as part of the extensive early Dover township. It includes Wheelwright Pond, named for the Reverend John Wheelwright, the founder of Exeter.

Wheelwright Pond was the site of a noted early battle during King William&#x27;s War. Indians, incited by the government of New France, attacked Exeter on July 4, 1690. They were pursued by two infantry companies raised for the purpose, who overtook them at Wheelwright Pond on July 6, 1690. Fierce fighting on that day would leave 3 officers and 15 soldiers dead, together with a large number of Indians. Among the dead were Captain Noah Wiswall, Lieutenant Gershom Flagg, and Ensign Edward Walker of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

In 1735, Durham, which included Lee, separated from Dover. Then Lee, in turn, would separate from Durham on January 16, 1766, when it was established by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. It was among the last of 129 towns to receive a charter during his administration, and named for British General Charles Lee, who later joined the American Revolution.

Lee is hometown for numerous faculty of the University of New Hampshire in Durham. In 2007 the U.S. Postal Service assigned the town its own ZIP code—03861.

==Geography==

The town is drained by the Lamprey River, North River and Oyster River. Lee lies fully within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed.

<text>Madbury is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,918 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Madbury was originally a part of Dover called &quot;Barbadoes&quot;, after the West Indies island of Barbados with which settlers conducted trade, sending wood and lumber in exchange for sugar, molasses, slaves and other commodities. The name survives at Barbadoes Pond. Garrison houses were built as protection against the Native Americans. Later it was part of Durham, a Dover parish which organized in 1716 and then incorporated in 1735. Madbury was once the farm of Sir Francis Champernowne of Greenland, and named after his ancient family&#x27;s mansion at Modbury in Devon, England.

The name Madbury Parish was first recorded in a 1755 grant made by colonial governor Benning Wentworth, with full town privileges granted in 1768 by his successor, Governor John Wentworth. A lumbering and farming community, Madbury was incorporated in 1775. Jackson in Carroll County was first settled in 1778 as &quot;New Madbury&quot; by residents of the town. Today, Madbury is residential, its inhabitants generally employed elsewhere. Numerous faculty of the nearby University of New Hampshire reside here.

==Geography==
The town of Madbury is shaped like a wedge, extending from the southeastern tip of the town touching Cedar Point on Little Bay to the town&#x27;s border with Barrington to the northwest. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 4.65% of the town. The highest point of land is the summit of Hicks Hill, at above sea level, located close to the center of town.

Although a branch of the Oyster River rises in western Madbury, the Bellamy River is the only river of size in town. Bellamy Reservoir, fed by the Bellamy River together with Mallego Brook, covers and provides 60% of the water supply for Portsmouth. It was created in 1960 with a dam built by the Army Corps of Engineers.

Elliot Rose Greenhouses, which were constructed in 1901. The Elliot greenhouses provided many jobs, especially at the nearby railroad depot. Glass and greenhouse supplies, in addition to several carloads of coal, came to the Madbury Station each week. Roses were shipped to destinations throughout the northeast United States.

<text>Middleton is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,823 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Granted by the Masonian Proprietors in 1749, the town was named after Sir Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham, who was in charge of convoy service between Barbados and the colonies. The land was first settled shortly before the Revolutionary War by settlers from Lee and Rochester. Soon after the war, its population was challenged when a number of Quaker families led by the town auditor, Nicholas Austin, left for the more peaceful setting of Austin, Quebec. Although the soil is rocky and unsuited for cultivation, cider was made in considerable quantities, and maple syrup to some extent.

Middleton was situated on the road between the New Hampshire Seacoast and Wolfeboro, the location of colonial governor John Wentworth&#x27;s summer home, &quot;Kingswood&quot;. (Today the road survives as &quot;Governors Road&quot; in northern Rochester and Milton and continues as &quot;Kings Highway&quot; through Middleton.) Neglect of the road caused the governor to bill the proprietors for repairs he had to make for safe travel to Kingswood, built in 1771. Middleton was incorporated on March 4, 1778, and originally included Brookfield, which was split off in December 1794.

Middleton&#x27;s old Town Hall, located on King&#x27;s Highway, was built in 1795 as a meetinghouse on Ridge Road. It was moved to its current location in 1812, jacked-up on the new site, and the Town Hall added underneath. The original stucco painting, a wrap-around landscape mural of trees and scenery, was painted by John Avery in 1811 and touched up in 1841.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.33% of the town. That water is primarily contained by Sunrise Lake, previously known as the Old Dump Reservoir, near the southern corner of the town. Sunrise Lake drains south toward the Cocheco River in Farmington, while the rest of the town drains eastward toward the Branch River, a tributary of the Salmon Falls River. Jones Brook flows through the center of town and joins the Branch River in the northern part of Milton. The entire town is part of the Piscataqua River watershed. The Moose Mountains, which separate Middleton from Brookfield, have a series of peaks, including the highest point in Middleton at an elevation of above sea level.

The town is served by New Hampshire Route 153.

<text>Milton is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,482 at the 2020 census. A manufacturing, resort and residential town, Milton includes the village of Milton Mills. The primary village in town, where 593 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Milton census-designated place (CDP), and is located along New Hampshire Route 125 and the Salmon Falls River, just north of Route 75.

==History==
Originally a part of Rochester variously called the &quot;Northeast Parish&quot;, &quot;Three Ponds&quot; or &quot;Milton Mills&quot;, the town was settled in 1760. It was set off and incorporated in 1802 as &quot;Milton&quot;, the name either a contraction of &quot;mill town&quot;, or else derived from a relative of the Wentworth colonial governors—William Fitzwilliam, Earl Fitzwilliam and Viscount Milton. The town of Fitzwilliam also bears his name.

The high concentration of water-powered industries in Milton caused Ira W. Jones to found and operate an engineering firm from offices on Main Street in Milton. The company did business as I W Jones Engineers.

In 1893 Jonas Spaulding opened a leatherboard mill in Milton, organizing the business as J. Spaulding and Sons. His sons were Leon C., Huntley N. and Rolland H., of whom Huntley and Rolland would serve as governors of New Hampshire. Jonas and his sons would undertake the construction of another leatherboard mill in North Rochester around 1900. Jonas died before the North Rochester mill became operational. The brothers continued to run the business successfully and brought the Spaulding Brothers leatherboard mill in Townsend Harbor, Massachusetts, under the J. Spaulding and Sons banner in 1902. They were successful with a machine to manufacture shoe counters and with experiments to make vulcanized fiber. In 1912 they opened a purpose-built facility to make vulcanized fiber in Tonawanda, New York. In 1913 J. Spaulding and Sons opened a second leatherboard mill in Milton. They also acquired the Kennebunk Manufacturing Company (KEMACO), which made lunch boxes and violin cases using leatherboard and vulcanized fiber and at one time had facilities in Milton as well.

The town contains some distinctive architecture, particularly the Milton Town House, built in 1808, and the Milton Free Public Library, a Second Empire former schoolhouse built at Milton Mills in 1875.

==Geography==
The main village of Milton is in the southern part of the town, along the west side of the Salmon Falls River at the outlet of Milton Pond. The village of Milton Mills is in the northern part of the town, by road north of Milton village.

The Spaulding Turnpike (New Hampshire Route 16) runs north to south through Milton, with access from Exit 17 (New Hampshire Route 75) in the south, near Milton village, and from Exit 18 (New Hampshire Route 125) in the north, just south of the Wakefield town line.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 3.57% of the town. Milton is drained by the Salmon Falls River, which forms the eastern boundary of the town and the New Hampshire–Maine state line. The town is part of the Piscataqua River watershed. Teneriffe Mountain is the highest point in Milton, with the summit reaching above sea level.

*The Milton Free Public Library (MFPL) in Milton Mills is housed in a building that was constructed in 1875 as a school house, and continued in this role until 1991, when its elementary grade students were bused daily down to Milton. It was the following year—1992—that MFPL relocated from smaller premises on Jug Hill Road to its current location. Before that the library was located at the current historical society, which was built in 1916 with the purpose of becoming a library. The land was donated by John E. Towsend, and did not become part of the town until September 26, 1921. The very first librarian that worked at this location was John Simes, and the first group of trustees were John E. Horne, Everett Fox, and Moses G. Chamberlain.

<text>New Durham is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,693 at the 2020 census. It is drained by the Merrymeeting, Cocheco and Ela rivers, and is known for Merrymeeting Lake. New Durham is home to the Powder Mill Fish Hatchery, located on Merrymeeting Road. Also located here is the Lions Club&#x27;s Camp Pride, a camp for children and adults with special needs.

==History==

Granted by the Masonian Proprietors in 1749 as &quot;Cochecho Township&quot;, New Durham was first settled by Europeans in 1750, almost entirely by colonists from Durham. It would be incorporated as &quot;New Durham&quot; on December 7, 1762. With a somewhat uneven and rocky surface, the town was better suited to grazing than cultivation. Lumber became the chief article of trade, and by 1859 New Durham had five sawmills and four shingle mills. It also had two gristmills, and a gunpowder factory called the Eureka Powder Works. On September 19, 1849, the Cocheco Railroad opened through the town, connecting Dover with Alton Bay.

An early town minister, Reverend Benjamin Randall, founded a new religious denomination in 1780 called the Free Will Baptists, later known as Free Baptists. The church has two buildings in the community; the older built in 1819 on New Durham Ridge.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 5.98% of the town. The southern part of the town is drained by the headwaters of the Cocheco River and its tributary, the Ela River, and is part of the Piscataqua River watershed, flowing to the Atlantic Ocean at Portsmouth. The northern part of town is home to Merrymeeting Lake and its outlet, the Merrymeeting River, which flows west to Lake Winnipesaukee and is part of the Merrimack River watershed. The highest point in town (and in Strafford County) is above sea level, on the western slope of Copple Crown Mountain, along the town&#x27;s eastern border. The mountain&#x27;s summit is in the neighboring town of Brookfield, in Carroll County.

New Durham is served by New Hampshire Route 11.

<text>Rochester is a city in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 32,492 at the 2020 census, making it the 6th most populous city in New Hampshire. In addition to the downtown area, the city contains the villages of East Rochester, Gonic, and North Rochester. Rochester is home to Skyhaven Airport and part of Baxter Lake.

Rochester was one of New Hampshire&#x27;s fastest growing cities between 2010 and 2020.

==History==

===Origins===

The town was one of four granted by colonial governor Samuel Shute of Massachusetts and New Hampshire during his brief term. Incorporated in 1722, it was named for his close friend, Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester, brother-in-law to King James II. As was customary, tall white pine trees were reserved for use as masts by the Royal Navy.

===Rochester Common===
In 1737, the Reverend Amos Main became the first settled pastor of the Congregational Church, located on Rochester Hill. The building would be moved to Rochester Common, which then encompassed and was called &quot;Norway Plain Mille Common&quot; after its abundant Norway pines. At the time, the Common extended into what is now downtown Rochester. By 1738, the farming community contained 60 families. A statue of Parson Main, sculpted by Giuseppe Moretti, today presides over the town square.
By 1780 the area surrounding the Common was the most thickly settled part of town, so a meeting house/church was erected on the east end of the Common with the entrance facing what is now South Main Street. A cemetery was also established near the new meeting house, but the ground was found to be too wet, and the bodies were removed to the Old Rochester Cemetery. In 1842 the Meeting House/church was moved to the present-day location at the corner of Liberty and South Main streets. As the years went by the size of the Common would shrink as more of it was sold off for development. A bandstand was constructed in 1914. Today, the Common is used for community activities such as Memorial Day events and for concerts throughout the summer months, in addition to having a walking track.
During the Revolutionary War the Common was used as the meeting place for soldiers before going off to war. The common is also the location of the city&#x27;s Civil War monument that bears the names of the 54 men who died then. The monument was dedicated in the 1870s, and in the 1880s the statue was added to the monument. Four Civil War cannons also decorated the monument, but during World War II the cannon were melted down for use in the war. They were replaced by World War II guns.

The bandstand was built in 1914 by Miles Dustin; before then band concerts were held on the square. The flag pole was donated by J. Frank Place in 1917. He was the former publisher of the &quot;Rochester Courier&quot;.

===Early education===
In 1750, Rochester voted at a town meeting to establish a public school to teach writing and reading to the town&#x27;s children. The vote was quickly overturned, which violated colonial laws mandating schools in each community. In 1752 the first public schooling began. The school lasted for 16 weeks and the schoolmaster was named John Forst. He was paid a salary of 15 pounds and boarded with a different family each month (this family received 30 cents a week from the city).

For many years the city followed the pattern of the first school by opening one and closing it shortly after. Eventually the citizens realized a school was necessary, but funding one was an issue. In 1783 the state demanded that schools were opened permanently or else the state would penalize them. A year later permanent schools were established. Corporal punishment was commonly used by the schoolmasters.

In 1806 the school system was divided into districts in accordance with state law that was passed in 1805. This system of districts remained in place until 1884 when laws regarding districts changed. The schools in this system often lacked the necessary educational materials. Eventually the number of students attending school across the state diminished. This led to the abolishment of this system, because communities across the state including Rochester had many schools with extremely low numbers of students.

In 1850 the city voted to allow high schools and the funding of them. However money was not actually raised for high schools until 1868. The first high school opened in 1857. The principal and teacher was William A. Kimball. At that time a school year lasted for 22 weeks. High school attendance was relatively low, and most dropped out before graduating.

===Growth through the 19th century===
Mail service was established in 1768 when a post rider traveled from Portsmouth through Berwick, Dover and Rochester bringing gazettes. In 1792 this improved when Joseph Paine would deliver and pick up mail once a week. When he arrived in town a horn would blow to inform the town of his presence. A regular post office was established on March 26, 1812, in the Barke Tavern. The first postmaster in Rochester was William Barker.
The first large business was lumbering, although it would be overtaken by other industries as Rochester developed into a mill town with the Cochecho River to provide water power. In 1806, six tanneries were operating, along with a sawmill, fulling mill, and two gristmills. By the 1820s–1830s, the town had a cabinet maker and clockmaker. The Mechanics Company was established in 1834, producing woolen blankets that won the premium quality award at the 1853 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The Norway Plains Woolen Company manufactured blankets used by the Union Army in the Civil War, and in 1870 wove of textiles, but by century&#x27;s end was out of business. Shoe manufacturing had surpassed textiles as Rochester&#x27;s dominant industry by 1880.

In 1854, the E.G. &amp; E. Wallace Shoe Company was established, eventually becoming the city&#x27;s largest employer, with over 700 workers in 1901. Its name changed to the Rochester Shoe Corporation in the 1920s. The Wallace brothers died in the 1890s, and other shoe factories opened, including Perkins, Linscott &amp; Company (later the Linscott, Tyler, Wilson Company) off Wakefield Street and N. B. Thayer &amp; Company, Inc., in East Rochester. In the early twentieth century, more people were employed in shoe manufacturing than in all other local industries combined. Rochester contributed to New Hampshire&#x27;s position as the nation&#x27;s third largest shoe-producing state. The Kessel Fire Brick Company was established in 1889, and at one time bricks for new buildings at Harvard University were made in Gonic. Carrying the freight were four railroads that once passed through Rochester, a major junction between Haverhill, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine. Agriculture continued to be important, and in 1875 the Rochester Fair was established. In 1891, Rochester was incorporated as a city.

The first telephone was installed in 1885 in the K.C. Sanborn Drug Store. The phone was connected to the Dover Telephone Exchange. By the early 1900s there were 1,200 local calls and 400 toll calls a day made from Rochester.

In 1889 and 1900 Jonas Spaulding and his three sons Leon, Huntley, and Rolland, built a leatherboard mill at North Rochester. Jonas died before the mill became operational, but his three sons ran it well in co-partnership and expanded the company nationally and internationally. Leon Cummings Spaulding served as the J Spaulding and Sons Company president after his father&#x27;s death.

During the Great Depression, however, several industries left for cheaper operating conditions in the South or went bankrupt. But the affluent mill era left behind fine architecture, including the Rochester Public Library, a Carnegie Library designed by the Concord architects Randlett &amp; Griffin.

===Library===

The Rochester Public Library was approved in 1893 but was not open to the public until early 1894. Back then, the library was located on the corner of Portland Street and South Main Street. In 1897, the library moved to City Hall, where it remained for over eight years.
In the early 1900s, Osman Warren, Rochester&#x27;s postmaster, contacted Andrew Carnegie for help in securing an endowment to build the new library. The Carnegie Institute donated $20,000 to construct the new building. The new library was built on the site of what was the Main Street School. The library was built in the Georgian revival style, using brick and granite, and the inside was finished with golden oak and cypress. The library opened on October 2, 1905, and 150 people registered the first day. Miss Lillian Parshley was the first librarian, serving until her death in 1945. Velma Foss, Miss Parshley&#x27;s assistant, was the second librarian of the Rochester Library.

===City Hall and Opera House===
Another notable structure is Rochester City Hall, built in 1908, and Opera House designed by George G. Adams. Adams designed other municipal government/opera house dual-purpose buildings around New England, including in Bellows Falls, Vermont (1887); Amesbury, Massachusetts (1887); Dover, New Hampshire (1891); and Derry, New Hampshire (1901). Only four of his structures survive today (in Waterville, Maine, Montpelier, Vermont, Derry, and Rochester), with many of his buildings destroyed by fires.

Adams&#x27; opera houses were unique because of their floors, which were movable and could function in both inclined or level position. With the floor in the inclined position, the opera house would show plays, concerts, etc. When the floor was level, the building could be used for dances or public meetings. The Rochester Opera House opened on Memorial Day 1908. Almost all of Adams&#x27; buildings contained movable floors, though the buildings in Waterville and Montpelier did not. Because of the destruction of the other opera houses, the Rochester Opera House is the only known theatre in the United States to use this type of movable floor.

Rochester City Hall contained the Rochester Police Department in its basement offices for many years. Some historical portraits of officers remain in an upstairs chamber where a collection of portraits of city officials was traditionally preserved, including officers Nelson S. Hatch and Red Hayes.

Today, visitors may still attend shows at the Rochester Opera House. The City of Rochester has preserved the 90-year-old historical décor of the Opera House.

===20th century===
Rochester&#x27;s thriving shoe industry in the early twentieth century attracted entrepreneurs from out of state. In 1930 Samuel J. Katz of Brookline, Massachusetts, incorporated the Hubbard Shoe Company and commenced operations in N. B. Thayer &amp; Company&#x27;s factory on Pleasant Street in East Rochester before the end of the year. By 1931 the firm had also taken over the Linscott, Tyler, Wilson factory off Wakefield Street in Rochester, which it purchased outright in May 1932. At its peak, the Hubbard Shoe Company employed about four hundred people in East Rochester making men&#x27;s shoes and five hundred in Rochester making women&#x27;s shoes, with a total annual payroll of $3 million and total annual output of 2.5 million shoes. In 1934 the Maybury Shoe Company began operations on the former E.G. &amp; E. Wallace site on South Main Street. Both firms survived the Great Depression, providing steady jobs for hundreds of Rochester citizens, and converted to a wartime footing during World War Two, but were unable to compete against the flood of cheap foreign imports in the 1970s. Hubbard Shoe Company went out of business in 1973, and Maybury Shoe closed in the mid-1970s. Samuel Katz&#x27;s son Saul, however, went on to found the profitable Rockport Shoe Company with his son, Bruce R. Katz.

Rochester passed out of the silent film era on May 20, 1929, with the arrival of the first talking motion picture in the city, titled &quot;The Wild Party&quot;, starring Clara Bow. The movie was shown at the Scenic Theater. The evening admission price was 35 cents for adults and 15 cents for children.

A &quot;Rochester Courier&quot; article from October 1930 described a new indoor golf course:
INDOOR GOLF COURSE TO BE OPENED ON SATURDAY&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The Leavitt Theatre Property Transformed Inside Into a Bower of Beauty&quot; - Rochester is to have an indoor golf course, which, it is said, will be second to none, in beauty and attractiveness, this side of New York. Fred Couture, proprietor of the Scenic theatre, who a few months since purchased the Leavitt theatre on South Main Street, has been laying out a small fortune in fitting it up on the ground floor for such use. This building was formerly the residence of the Hon. Summer Wallace and was one of the most beautiful mansions in New Hampshire. Despite the way in which the outside was altered to make the theatre, much of the magnificent paneling inside has been preserved. It was a foundation for an unusual setting for indoor golf. A large force of workers has been engaged in recent weeks, working in relays, and this week six scene painters are decorating the walls and ceilings. There are to be an Egyptian room, a Japanese room, an Indian room and a Dutch room. The walls of each are adorned with appropriate paintings to form a picture of any particular land represented. The Dutch room, for example, not only has the paintings of the canals and dikes but an actual windmill revolving. In the Indian room are pictures of forests and streams, with an Indian paddling a canoe. There is a real waterfall too, with the water flowing down over actual rocks into a series of three basins, with a pool for goldfish at the bottom. One room represents the seashore, the entire wall being one huge painting of the ocean, with a real light house perched up on a promontory, with a light shedding forth its rays. There is also a garden room with a profusion of flowers. There are various rest rooms and seats in plenty everywhere for the onlookers or tired players. All the floors will be covered with artificial grass. In a conspicuous place is a great pile of stones, with a fountain at the top, out of which a tiny stream trickles down over the rocks in various small channels and little pools. Ferns grow on its sides. There are also in various places tree trunks, some birch with their white bark and other varieties. There will be eighteen holes to the golf course, with various traps and some mysteries. The whole place is certainly a wonderful representation of the great out-of-doors and a veritable dream of loveliness. The grand opening is set for Saturday evening at 6:00, when Mayor Louis H. McDuffee will press the button and turn on the lights.

===Natural disasters===
The summer of 1947 was dry. In late October of that year only 1/8 inch of rain had fallen since mid-September, and the temperatures were high. Small ponds and streams were dried up, and local farmers were using water from the Salmon Falls River and Cocheco River to provide water for their livestock. Fire risk was high. On October 21, sparks from a passing train car in Farmington ignited the dry grass on both sides of the track, starting the biggest fire to strike Rochester.

At first, firefighters seemed to have the fire in control, but two days later, winds up to drove the &quot;small&quot; fire out of control. The wind-driven fire moved to the south and east into Rochester. The fire would engulf an area over long and over wide with walls of flame high. Before the fire was under control, over 30 homes in Rochester would be lost.

Hurricane Carol struck New Hampshire on September 2, 1954. The winds of the hurricane were in excess of . The property damage in New Hampshire was estimated to be 3 million dollars, and of rain fell during the storm.

A Category 5 hurricane, known locally as the Hurricane of &#x27;38, was the most deadly of New Hampshire&#x27;s history, causing excessive damage to Rochester and outlying communities. Hurricane Carol was a Category 3 storm.

<text>Rollinsford is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,597 at the 2020 census. The main village in town was once known as &quot;Salmon Falls Village&quot;.

==History==
The area was once within the domain of the Newichawannock people, an Abenaki sub-tribe which took its name from the Newichawannock River, meaning &quot;river with many falls&quot;, now the Salmon Falls River. Their village was located at what later was known as Salmon Falls Village and is now Rollinsford. They fished at the falls, stretching nets across the river to catch migrating salmon and other species swimming upriver to spawn. But war and disease, probably smallpox brought from abroad, decimated the native population.

Subsequently, settled by about 1630, the land was part of Dover, one of the original townships of New Hampshire. The area was first called &quot;Sligo&quot;, likely after County Sligo in Ireland, and the name survives on a town road. An historical marker on Sligo Road reads, &quot;Near this place lived David Hamilton of Westburn born in the parish of Cambuslang, Scotland in October 1620; captured by Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester, England, September 3, 1651; Brought to America as a prisoner in chains on the &quot;John and Sarah&quot; in the same year; settled near here and married Annah Jaxson of Lanark, Scotland. Killed by Indians on September 28, 1691.&quot;

In 1729 the area was established as a parish called &quot;Summersworth&quot;, meaning summer town, because the ministers preached here during the summer. In 1754, it was set off and incorporated as a town by colonial governor Benning Wentworth, although thereafter spelled &quot;Somersworth&quot; due to a clerical error. Since the first settlers&#x27; arrival, small communities had developed near various sawmills and gristmills along the Salmon Falls River, but the center of &quot;Summersworth&quot; was located at Rollinsford Junction.

Beginning in the early 1820s, water powered textile mills were established at the larger falls, and the town was divided between them—Great Falls became Somersworth, and Salmon Falls became Rollinsford, incorporated in 1849. It was named in honor of the Rollins family, whose ancestor Judge Ichabod Rollins had settled there many generations before and had become the first probate judge for the state.

==Salmon Falls Village==
The village of Salmon Falls was founded in 1823 by a group of local investors led by James Rundlet of Portsmouth, who on June 17, 1822, incorporated the Salmon Falls Manufacturing Company to manufacture woolen cloth using the power of the Salmon Falls River, a Piscataqua River tributary. After an 1834 fire destroyed the first factory built there, the company&#x27;s Portsmouth-based investors built a new factory for cotton manufacturing, eventually selling the corporation to their Boston-based cotton broker Mason and Lawrence in the 1840s. As part of their expansion, the town was laid out in an easy-to-navigate grid plan, with the three-story boarding houses and an adjoining mill building made of brick to withstand fires. Two-story brick double houses were also built to accommodate the families of the overseers. The town thrived into the first decades of the 20th century and eventually became home to many immigrant families whose forebears came to work in the mills. Although the town planners originally forbade the mill workers to drink alcohol and required that they attend church on Sunday, during Prohibition, its proximity to temperate Maine and the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad line led to the establishment of numerous bars and a relatively short-lived but racy reputation for free-flowing liquor.

The New England cotton industry would fade in the early to mid-20th century, but would leave the brick town intact. Today, the mills have been reborn as low-cost studio space for more than 100 artists and artisans who use the converted studios for everything from painting, sculpting and crafting handmade furniture to teaching and practicing yoga and dance.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Rollinsford has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 3.71% of the town. The town is bounded on the east by the Salmon Falls River, which serves as the New Hampshire–Maine border. The western half of the town is drained by Rollins and Twombly brooks, which flow south to the Cochecho River in neighboring Dover. The entire town is part of the Piscataqua River watershed. The highest point in town is an unnamed summit near the border with Somersworth. Garrison Hill, above sea level, occupies the town&#x27;s border with Dover to the west.

New Hampshire Route 4 crosses the town, leading southwest to Dover and northeast to South Berwick, Maine, where it becomes Maine State Route 4.

<text>Somersworth is a city in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 11,855 at the 2020 census. Somersworth has the smallest area and third-lowest population of New Hampshire&#x27;s 13 cities.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, the area that is now Somersworth was central-south Abenaki land. These Algonquian speaking peoples of the Wabanaki Confederacy lived along what they called &quot;Newichwanook&quot;, now the Salmon Falls River. Colonists from Britain arriving before 1700 named the area &quot;Sligo&quot;, after Sligo in Ireland and settled there as a part of Dover. The community was organized in 1729 as the parish of &quot;Summersworth&quot;, meaning &quot;summer town&quot;, because during that season the ministers preached here. It was set off and incorporated in 1754 by colonial governor Benning Wentworth, and until 1849 included Rollinsford. A clerical error at incorporation contracted the name to &quot;Somersworth&quot;. It was incorporated as a city in 1893, before which it was also known as &quot;Great Falls&quot;.
Situated where the Salmon Falls River drops over a mile, Somersworth early became a mill town, beginning with gristmills and sawmills. In 1822, the brothers Isaac and Jacob Wendell of Boston purchased for $5,000 a gristmill with its water rights at the Great Falls. They established the Great Falls Manufacturing Company, a textile business that expanded to include three mills for spinning thread and weaving cotton and woolen fabrics, specializing in &quot;drillings, shirtings and sheetings&quot;. Throughout the 19th century, other expansive brick mill buildings, including a bleachery and dye works, were erected beside the river. The bleachery became the longest running textile operation in Somersworth. The building housed the operations that took the buff-colored fabric produced in the seven mills and transformed it into a sparkling white material that could be dyed or printed according to the buyer&#x27;s wishes. The gate house at the dam directed water as needed, regulating the flow either into the river or a company canal, which itself had gates sending it under the mill. Water power turned the wheels and belts that operated mill machinery. The railroad arrived in the early 1840s, before which goods were carted to Dover.

At first, millworkers came from surrounding farms, including those in Berwick, Maine, directly across the bridge, many of whom were women. But as the need for labor grew, immigrants arrived from Ireland, and later Quebec. Brick tenement row houses were rented by the company to employee families, many of whose members worked in the mills beside their parents before passage of child labor laws. For relaxation, workers found entertainment at the Opera House or at Central Park, an amusement park beside Willand Pond. In the early 1870s, the Portsmouth, Great Falls &amp; Conway Railroad began excursions to the White Mountains. The Electric Street Railway came in 1890, allowing trolley rides to York Beach, Maine.

In 1922, Somersworth was affected by the 1922 New England Textile Strike, shutting down the mills in the city over an attempted wage cut and hours increase.

But the New England textile industry went into decline later in the 20th century. Water power was replaced with newer forms of energy, and cotton could be manufactured where it grew, saving transportation costs. Labor was also cheaper in the South, which did not have New Hampshire&#x27;s inventory tax that levied commodities like coal and cotton at the plants. The Great Depression sent many regional textile firms into bankruptcy, when some local facilities were adapted for shoemaking. The Great Falls Manufacturing Company&#x27;s big mill was renovated for other uses in the 1980s, although the bleachery suffered a devastating fire in November 2003, which required assistance from 23 fire departments from New Hampshire and Maine. Aclara Technologies operates a factory (previously owned by General Electric Company) that manufactures state of the art electric meters for the energy business.

Somersworth&#x27;s heyday was during the mill era. Although frequently overshadowed by the larger neighboring cities of Dover and Rochester, Somersworth retains a quantity of Victorian architecture from its prosperous age. Some antique residences, most notably within the historic district known as &quot;The Hill&quot;, have been restored. The municipality is today largely a bedroom community for other cities and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The upper end of High Street, however, continues to develop as a retail center, with several big-box chain stores.

One ship of the United States Navy was named after the city; the was a PCE-842-class patrol craft. Commissioned in April 1944, it was named after the city in February 1956, and remained in service until decommissioned in September 1965.

==Education==
The Somersworth School District consists of Somersworth High School (grades 9–12), Somersworth Middle School (grades 6–8), and two elementary schools, Idlehurst Elementary School and Maple Wood Elementary School.

Somersworth&#x27;s first high school (pictured above) opened in 1850 and was located at 17 Grand Street. Hilltop School, built at the same location in 1927, replaced the original high school. Later it would be converted to an elementary school.

In 1999, after numerous fire code violations were identified with the Hilltop School by the New Hampshire State Fire Marshal, the City of Somersworth was granted waivers for a period of three years to address the state&#x27;s concerns. Despite the failure of the school district to address the numerous code violations during the probation period, the waivers continued to be extended past their originally intended three-year period. In August 2007, the upper floors of the school were closed by the New Hampshire State Fire Marshall after the city neglected to fix code violations they were warned about in November 2006.

The closure of the upper floors came just weeks before neighborhood students were scheduled to return from summer vacation. This resulted in the start of school being delayed by over two weeks for Hilltop students. Three portable classrooms were brought in for &quot;2 years&quot; in 2007. Students were still occupying the three portable classrooms surpassing the time allotted as of August 18, 2010.

In the spring of 2007, the Somersworth School Board voted to build a new school to replace Hilltop. On February 17, 2009, the Somersworth City Council voted to approve bonding in the amount of $19.9 million for the construction of a new elementary school. The new school has been named Idlehurst, and has been functioning in the SAU 56 school system as of the start of the 2011–2012 school year.

In May 2019, Somersworth Middle School was awarded 2019 Middle School of the Year by the New Hampshire Department of Education. The middle school, led by Principal Dana Hilliard, was awarded this award for excellence in education for its ability to engage students and support their social and emotional growth.

<text>Strafford is a town in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,230 at the 2020 census. The two main settlements in town are Center Strafford and Bow Lake Village.

== History ==
Once part of Barrington, Strafford was set off due to the lengthy travel required to attend town meetings. Settled prior to the Revolution, the town incorporated in 1820, taking its name from the county in which it is located. Strafford County had been organized in 1773 during the administration of colonial governor John Wentworth, and named in honor of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford.
The Austin Academy once stood in the center of Strafford village. George Cate, a wealthy shoe manufacturer, visited the school at the request of its principal Alvin E. Thomas and was so impressed with the school that he left at his death $200,000 on the condition that his name be added to that of Mr. Austin. After his death, the hundred-acre farm of George Washington Foss was purchased, and soon a beautiful new building, designed by well-known New Hampshire architect J. Edward Richardson, sat on the hill with the name on its façade, &quot;Austin-Cate Academy - 1903&quot;. The property has been purchased by the state for a National Guard training center. The Foss farmhouse that was used as a dormitory burned in 1961 and was replaced with a one-story dormitory. The main building had burned in the early 1930s and was replaced with the brick building, also designed by Richardson, that is there now.

== Geography ==

<text>Acworth is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. At the 2020 census, the town had a total population of 853.

==History==

Originally chartered by colonial governor Benning Wentworth in 1752, it was called &quot;Burnet&quot; after William Burnet, a former governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. In 1754, however, the French and Indian War broke out, and no settlements were made under the charter. Wentworth regranted the township on September 19, 1766, naming it after Sir Jacob Acworth, a former Surveyor of the Royal Navy. The town was first permanently settled in 1768 by several families from Londonderry, New Hampshire.

Acworth was incorporated in 1772 by Governor John Wentworth, but war again slowed its development. With the close of the Revolution, however, Acworth grew quickly. By 1859, it had 1,251 inhabitants, most of whom were occupied in agriculture. The Cold River provided water power for industry, including five sawmills, a gristmill, a woolen factory, a bobbin factory and a peg factory. There was also a boot and shoe manufacturer. Acworth is a source for museum-quality crystals such as beryl. The town of Acworth, Georgia, was named for this town, because this was the hometown of a railroad engineer there.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.65% of the town. Acworth is drained by the Cold River and its tributaries, except for the northwest corner of town, which drains north to the Little Sugar River. The town lies fully within the Connecticut River watershed. The highest point in Acworth is Gove Hill in the northeast part of town, at above sea level.

The town is crossed by one numbered state highway, New Hampshire Route 123A, which follows the Cold River and passes through the village of South Acworth. Although not numbered routes, the state also maintains a handful of other roads in the town, including Cold River Road, Hill Road, and a portion of Charlestown Road.
