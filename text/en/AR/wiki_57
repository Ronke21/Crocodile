<text>Steelville is a city in Crawford County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,472 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Crawford County. Steelville is the hometown of Congressman Albert Reeves and Missouri State Representative Jason Chipman. The town was named after the landowner James Steel.

==History==
Before the 1800s, the first people to live in the Steelville area were groups likely tied to the Osage nation. These peoples were driven west into what became modern-day Oklahoma. In the 1830s, the Trail of Tears, a government-sponsored forced march of the largest groups of the southeastern United States, passed through Steelville, with people primarily from the Choctaw and Cherokee tribes. They came mostly from Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee and were forced to relocate to Oklahoma and the West. It is believed that they stopped in Steelville around the spring to rest, bury their dead and get supplies.

The first settlers in Steelville were William Britton, who built a small grist mill along the Yadkin Creek, and James Steel, who operated a trading post and was appointed by the government as commissioner to lay out the city in 1835 – the year in which Steelville was founded. Britton remained in the area. Steel, according to census, moved northward to continue his interest in mining.

Steel purchased 40 acres of land from the government, which he later sold to the &quot;County Court&quot; on December 16, 1835, for $50. By this time, a little settlement had sprung up. Crawford County Court named the town Steelville as the county seat. The deed was recorded on December 18, 1835, the town was platted, and the first deeds to lots were sold for $12 each.

The Snelson-Brinker House was built outside Steelville by Levi Lane Snelson in 1834 and sold to John B. Brinker in 1837. Mary, a 14-year-old slave owned by Brinker, was hanged at Steelville in 1838 for the murder of Brinker&#x27;s infant daughter. She is the youngest person to be legally executed in Missouri.

The town was incorporated as a city of the fourth class in 1885. At this time, there were 500 inhabitants. The Lebanon Lodge, Masonic, was chartered on October 14, 1846. The first tailor, Mr. Vanburg, came in town in 1844. The first hotel was owned by James Davis. In 1847, A. W. Johnson opened a blacksmith shop. Andrew Jackson opened the first post office. Doctor Dunlap was the first doctor. In 1838, J. H. Johnson opened the first saddle and harness shop.

The Steelville Normal Business Institute was originally at Vichy. It was moved to Steelville with the help of John T. Woodruff of Springfield and Professor Hayes and opened during the latter part of 1890.

The first newspaper in Steelville, &quot;Steelville Crawford Missouri&quot;, was established on May 4, 1874, by Thomas Roberts. The paper was printed in a log cabin the first time and was a Republican paper.

The Steelville Bank began operations in October 1884 under the direction of its president, G. W. Matlock. This was constructed of brick and was very strong by the standards of that time. Later, the bank was named Crawford County Farmers Bank. In 1925, bank robbers made an attempt to rob it. Most of the robbers were killed. Robbers included Basil Doman, age 21, from Mitchell, Illinois. McCellan was wounded and died after being examined. Albert Walters, age 20, from Granite City, Illinois, was the driver of the getaway car and was shot. The youngest, Leslie Reiter, age 16, from Madison, Illinois, was sent to jail. One robber was dead, two were wounded, one was taken prisoner and a fifth escaped. He was never caught or identified. The sheriff at the time was Mr. Enke. There was only one citizen wounded – A. D. Schwieder – who was walking out of the adjoining store and was shot in the leg after a shoot out with one of the robbers, whom he killed.

While this was not how the town got its name, Steelville was located in an active iron mining area. The Cherry Valley Iron Mines just east of Steelville opened in 1878, and had produced 736,800 tons of ore between 1878 and 1910. The mines even created their own railway, the Crawford County Midland Railroad, to link with the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway to provide needed haulage services. However, iron production was more or less exhausted by 1924.

The Big Bend Rural School and Snelson-Brinker House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Gallatin is a city in Daviess County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,821 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Daviess County.

==History==
The territory now known as the county of Daviess, was initially inhabited by the Sauk, Meskwaki, and Pottawatomi peoples. &quot;The Treaty of 1837 removed the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri into Kansas.&quot; &quot;Gallatin was founded in 1837 and named for Albert Gallatin, America&#x27;s longest-serving Secretary of the Treasury (1801–1814). Gallatin was incorporated in 1856.
The Gallatin Election Day Battle took place on 6 August 1838. About 200 people attempted to forcibly prevent Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons) from voting in the newly created county&#x27;s first election. In October 1838, David W. Patten led Mormon troops in the Daviess County expedition in which the Mormons burned and looted much of Gallatin, Millport and Grindstone Fork, consecrating the stolen goods to the bishop&#x27;s storehouse. The skirmishes were part of the 1838 Mormon War. Gallatin is important in the Latter-day Saint religion; nearby is a place known to its members as Adam-ondi-Ahman. They believe it to be the site where Adam and Eve lived after they had been expelled from the Garden of Eden.

On December 7, 1869 Jesse James (and most likely Frank) robbed the Daviess County Savings Association. The robbery netted little money. Jesse is believed to have shot and killed the cashier, Captain John Sheets.

In 1892, Grand River College moved from Edinburg, Missouri to Gallatin, where it operated for a period under the auspices of William Jewell College before it closed permanently in 1910 after a fire.

The Daviess County Rotary Jail and Sheriff&#x27;s Residence, the A. Taylor Ray House and the Daviess County Courthouse are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

<text>Ava is the only incorporated city in Douglas County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,894 at the 2020 census. Ava is the county seat of Douglas County. The city was founded in 1871. It was renamed &quot;Ava&quot; in 1881, the town&#x27;s original name having been &quot;Militia Springs.&quot;

==Geography==
Ava is located in the southern portion of the Missouri Ozarks within the southern escarpment of the Salem Plateau. The lakes of the White River basin of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri lie to the south. The town is at the intersection of Missouri highways 5, 14 and 76. Mansfield is 13 miles to the north and Gainesville is approximately 30 miles south. Elevation of the town varies from .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Ava is home to co-owned radio stations KKOZ 1430 AM and KKOZ 92.1 FM.

==History==
The area was settled during the 1830s and Douglas County was incorporated in 1857, with Vera Cruz as county seat. In 1864, the town of Militia Springs was founded and became the new county seat in 1870. The town was platted in 1871 and renamed Ava in 1881, although not incorporated until 1908. Militia Springs was the location of an encampment of Union soldiers or Missouri Militia during the American Civil War.

During and after the Civil War, a dispute was ongoing regarding the county seat between Vera Cruz to the east and Arno to the west. In 1871, the citizens of Militia Springs built a court house building and moved the records there as a compromise. However, the building was burned and then rebuilt of hand hewn timbers rather than logs and re-opened in January 1873. The court house was burned again in 1886 and replaced in 1888. The current court house on the southeast corner of the town square was constructed in 1937.
In 1910 the Kansas City, Ozark and Southern Railroad was extended from Mansfield south to Ava to serve the growing agricultural and lumbering industries of Douglas County. The railroad remained in operation until 1935.

A city park, &quot;Militia Springs Park,&quot; was established in 2004 along Prairie Creek on North Spring Street. The location is the approximate site of the Civil War era military encampment. It has a play area and pavilion.

The Missouri Fox Trotter association was organized in Ava in 1948 and the annual shows are held at the association&#x27;s property, just north of Ava.

The Ava Ranger Station Historic District is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Drug Enforcement Administration incident==
The City of Gerald came into national spotlight in 2008 when it was revealed that Bill A. Jakob, a purported federal agent working for several months with Gerald police to curtail the meth abuse including participating in home raids without a warrant to arrest alleged drug dealers, was actually &quot;an unemployed former trucking company owner, a former security guard, a former wedding minister and a former small-town cop from 23 miles down the road.&quot; Jakob came to Gerald in January 2008 and misrepresented himself as an agent of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to the Gerald police chief. On some other occasions, he claimed to be a United States Marshal or an agent from the United States Department of Justice Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force.

Linda Trest, a staff writer for the &quot;Gasconade County Republican&quot; acting on reports of concerned citizens, uncovered the truth about Jakob, which ended the scam. After the national press coverage that included &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The National Inquirer,&quot; and &quot;The Post-Dispatch,&quot; Jacob was interviewed by Katie Couric on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

In September 2009 Jakob pleaded guilty to impersonating a federal agent. In December 2009 he was sentenced to serve 5 years in prison.

<text>Washington is a city on the south banks of the Missouri River, 50 miles west of St. Louis, Missouri. With an estimated population of 15,075, it is the largest city in Franklin County, Missouri. It is notable for being the &quot;corncob pipe capital of the world,&quot; with Missouri Meerschaum located on the city&#x27;s riverfront.

== History ==

Named after George Washington after it came under American control, the town was first settled during the rule of the Spanish Empire. It was originally called St. John Meyer&#x27;s Settlement and was the site of the Spanish log fort San Juan del Misuri (1796–1803).

Family and followers of Daniel Boone settled the area across the river from Washington, Missouri starting in 1799. In 1814 a ferry boat was licensed for crossing the Missouri River to the north, and the settlement became known as Washington Landing. In 1827 a town was laid out, with sale of lots starting in 1829. The cost of land was waived if the buyer could build a substantial house within two years. This encouraged many new settlers.

Substantial numbers of anti-slavery German families started moving to the town in 1833, and they soon overwhelmed the existing population of slaveowners. However, many of the original slaveowners&#x27; homes still remain throughout the town. Washington became a strong supporter of the Union during the American Civil War. The town was ransacked by Confederate General Sterling Price&#x27;s soldiers, but they were unable to keep control of the area.

After the war, Washington became a railroad and steamboat transportation center. Its manufacturing industry, while strong, is not as vibrant as it was decades ago.

The town of Washington has 445 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. Due to its historic charm, Washington has a growing heritage tourism industry, with visitors also attracted to the nearby Missouri Rhineland.

The Washington Bridge was constructed in 1934 and was the only bridge spanning the Missouri River in Franklin County. It was replaced with a new, wider bridge that was opened to traffic on December 3, 2018. The original bridge was demolished on April 13, 2019.

In 1988, the nation’s first Walmart Supercenter opened in Washington.

<doc id="122702" wikidata="Q966428" url="?curid=122702" title="Hermann, Missouri">
<text>Hermann is a city in and the county seat of Gasconade County, Missouri, United States. It has been the county seat since 1842. It is near the center of the Missouri Rhineland and south of the Missouri River. The population was 2,185 at the 2020 census.

Described as a Rhineland village, the city is the commercial center of the Hermann American Viticultural Area, whose seven wineries produce about one-third of the state&#x27;s wine. Designated in 1983, it is one of the first federally recognized American Viticultural Areas. The designation recognized the renaissance of an area of vineyards and wineries established by Rhinelanders during the mid-19th century. Shut down by Prohibition, it began to revive in the 1960s.

Hermann holds a &quot;Maifest&quot; during the third weekend in May and an &quot;Oktoberfest&quot; the first four weekends in October. Hermann also calls itself the sausage-making capital of Missouri.

==History==
The city was founded by the Deutsche Ansiedlungs-Gesellschaft zu Philadelphia (German Settlement Society of Philadelphia) in 1837. It was promoted by Gottfried Duden, who wrote about the area in his &quot;Bericht über eine Reise nach den westlichen Staaten Nord Amerikas&quot; (&quot;Report of a Journey to the Western States of Northern America&quot;). In November 1837, an early group of settlers was led by George Bayer, who bought the land on the behalf of the society. George was waylaid in Pittsburgh, though, due to illness and arrived in Hermann in the spring of 1838 leading another group of families. The town was platted after the society sold shares in the of Gasconade River valley land it had purchased.
The society had almost utopian goals of a &quot;heart of German America&quot; where it could perpetuate traditional German culture and establish a self-supporting colony built around farming, commerce, and industry. The town is named after Hermann der Cherusker, a Germanic leader who defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. In 2009, Hermann celebrated the 2000th anniversary of the battle, in which the Germanic warrior Hermann defeated three Roman legions.

A bronze statue of the city&#x27;s namesake was dedicated in the Hermann Park.

Hermann was the nearest town to the Gasconade Bridge train disaster, November 1, 1855. The Leimer Hotel in Hermann was used as a temporary hospital to treat the wounded.
In the 1960s, people began to rebuild the wine industry in the Hermann area. Today, the vineyards and wineries contribute to the agricultural and heritage tourism economies, with winery tours and wine tastings. Stone Hill Winery, the largest winemaking business in the state, and Hermannhof Winery are in the town; south of town off Missouri Highway 100 West is Adam Puchta Winery, the oldest continuously family-owned winery in the nation, under direct family ownership since 1855. Bias Vineyards is less than east near Berger on Missouri Highway 100. Also included in the Hermann AVA are Oakglenn Vineyards and Winery, east of Hermann; Bommarito Estate Almond Tree Winery; and Röbbler Vineyards and Winery near New Haven.

The Katy Trail, a -long bike path, passes through McKittrick, a town on the northern side of the Missouri River across from Hermann.

The Hermann Historic District, Kotthoff-Weeks Farm Complex, Old Stone Hill Historic District, William Poeschel House, The Rotunda, and Vallet-Danuser House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="122709" wikidata="Q953366" url="?curid=122709" title="King City, Missouri">
<text>King City is a city in southwest Gentry County, Missouri, United States. The population was 799 at the 2020 census.

==History==
John Pittsenbarger was the first European settler when he set up a tent in town in 1856. His application to name the town Petersburg was rejected because there was already a town of that name in Boone County, Missouri. According to local legend, the United States Postmaster General submitted his name. The Postmaster General at the time was Horatio King, (although the local history refers to Rufus King)

The town became a stop on the St. Joseph and Des Moines Railway in 1878. The railway eventually became part of the Burlington Northern network and is currently abandoned.

In the first half of the 20th century, King City was the heart of a Kentucky bluegrass seed harvesting region stretching from Kearney, Missouri through King City to Maitland, Missouri, which claimed to harvest more bluegrass seeds than the entire state of Kentucky with King City resident John Weller claiming to be the &quot;King of Blue Grass Raisers.&quot;. Bluegrass seed production moved to the farming areas of the Pacific Northwest in the 1950s.

In the 1990s, the Big Pump, a high building resembling an electric gasoline pump, was moved from Maryville, Missouri to King City. It is on the National Register of Historic Places. Rufus Limpp, an oil jobber who built the station, is from King City (the Limpp Community Lake by King City is also named for him).
The Big Pump is located on the Tri-County Museum grounds.

King City has only one grocery store, McCrea&#x27;s, a family operated business started by Dean and Virginia McCrea. They have owned the store for more than 50 years, and Mr. McCrea still works there every day.

One prominent former King Citian was celebrated children&#x27;s author Clyde Robert Bulla, who died in 2007 while living in Warrensburg, Missouri.

In 2006, St. Louis, Missouri-based Wind Capital Group began operation of 27 windmills a mile north of King City. The Bluegrass Ridge Wind Farm is the first commercial electric windmill operation in the state. Its windmills are high. The wind farm name celebrates the region&#x27;s bluegrass heritage.

The Opera Hall Block was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

==Education==
There are two schools, an elementary and junior high/high school, both named King City R-1. The schools consisted of neighboring buildings for many years, until a fire confined both schools into a single building while a new high school was constructed. In a subsequent remodeling, the two separate buildings were joined with a classroom/hallway addition. They have finished construction; making a new Ag building and more classrooms in both the High School and Elementary.

==Sports==
University of Missouri standout and NFL Hall of Famer Roger Wehrli of the former St. Louis (now Arizona) Cardinals is an alumnus of King City High School. King City&#x27;s football field is named Wehrli Field after him. Currently, committees are engaging in raising funds for the purpose of upgrading the track.

==Geography==
King City is located on US Route 169 three-quarters of a mile north of the Gentry-Dekalb county line. Stanberry is eleven miles to the north and Union Star in northwest Dekalb County is approximately six miles to the southwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

This is the highest accreditation awarded by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

==Arts and culture==

The most notable event that takes place in Fair Grove each year is the Fair Grove Heritage Reunion. This always takes place the last full weekend in September. This festival has its roots with the original Fair Grove Fair in the early 1900s and 1910s, and more recently with the Fair Grove Arts and Crafts Festival which started in 1978. Dan and Betty Manning organized a gathering of 12 local craftsmen to sell their wares on the square.

That first year, Granny Poke, in a bedraggled cookshack, fired up her wood stove to cook a batch of brown beans, poke greens, homemade fruit cobbler and cornbread. A short parade began the two-day event, with a small crowd attending. A few men of the town gathered at the mill to learn log splitting and shingle riving, and Sassafras tea, pawpaws and hickory nuts were available, just for the asking.

Since those early years, the organizers of that first festival have seen many changes and improvements. Today, the crowd estimate during the Fair Grove Heritage Reunion is 40,000 to 50,000 on Saturday and around 30,000 on Sunday. The number of booths have increased to almost 400, with many featuring demonstrations, such as weaving, bobbin lace and soap making. The two-day event still includes a parade and a church service in front of the historic mill.

Activities abound throughout the show area. Some of the favorites include corn grinding in the Boegel &amp; Hine Flour Mill, working draft teams, an antique tractor rodeo, horse and mule obstacle course and wheat threshing. Primitive gasoline engines and steam-powered engines are furnished through the Early Day Gas Engines and Tractor Association, Branch 16 and The Ozark Steam Engine Association. Demonstrations of corn shredders and a corn shellers also occur throughout the day.

The 2012 the festival had an estimated 80,000 attendance. In 2007, the festival parade was the longest ever (over 3 hours long) in celebration of the festival&#x27;s 40th Anniversary.

<doc id="122716" wikidata="Q267220" url="?curid=122716" title="Republic, Missouri">
<text>Republic is a city in Christian and Greene counties in the U.S. state of Missouri. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 18,750. In 2019, its population was 16,938, making it the second largest city in Greene County in the U.S. state of Missouri. It is also the fourth largest city in the Springfield, Missouri, Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Early settlement in southwest Greene County centered on the community of Little York. When the Atlantic &amp; Pacific Railroad built a line through the area in the early 1870s, Little York was not on the route. Settlement moved two miles away to Brookline which was on the rail line&#x27;s route.

Another group of settlers decided to take up residency at another area along the tracks just four miles southwest of Brookline. This village eventually became known as Republic, and was incorporated in 1871 While the railroad did go through Republic, there initially was no switch or depot located in the city. A public subscription of $1000 raised the funds to build a depot in the city. Subsequent growth is attributed to the depot&#x27;s completion.

===Consolidation with Village of Brookline===
In 2005, the cities of Republic and Brookline consolidated as Missouri State laws allow after a vote of the residents of both communities approved the consolidation with Republic taking over all aspects of city government. Originally, Brookline was to retain its own identity, but the city limit signs have since been changed to Republic&#x27;s. However, according to Section I (b) of the Intergovernmental Agreement:
&quot;Name of Consolidated Municipality - The name of the consolidated municipality shall be &quot;City of Republic.&quot; To help preserve the identity of the Village, the City will place signs with text “Village of Brookline” at the current corporate limits of the Village. Placement of signage is subject to State sign regulations when placed in State right-of-way. The City of Republic will work with the United States Postal Service to help preserve the history and operation of the Brookline Station Post Office.

While the Village of Brookline no longer exists as an independent, incorporated community, the post office and associated ZIP Code of 65619 remain in operation. In addition, BNSF Railway continues to designate Brookline as a station point on its network map and system timetables.

<text>Trenton is a city in Grundy County, Missouri, United States. The population was 5,609 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Grundy County. The city used to be the world&#x27;s largest producer of vienna sausages (at its biggest employer, the ConAgra Grocery Foods plant, now owned by Nestlé).

==History==
The Crowder State Park Vehicle Bridge, Jewett Norris Library, Plaza Hotel, St. Philip&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Trenton High School, and WPA Stock Barn and Pavilion are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===The Utopian Socialist Ruskin College Movement===
In 1869, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad arrived in Trenton. In 1890 Avalon College, which had been founded in Avalon, Missouri by the United Brethren in 1869, moved to Trenton because of proximity to the railroad. 

Due to financial difficulties, the college nearly closed again. In 1900 George McAnelly Miller started to turn the school around. He was soon joined by Walter Vrooman who had just returned from Oxford, England where he established Ruskin Hall, a university called the &quot;College for the People&quot; based on the Utopian Socialist writings of John Ruskin. Avalon College was renamed Ruskin College after Vrooman donated to it.

The college directly loaned money to the students and they could work at the school&#x27;s canning, farming and novelty wood working businesses. The college admitted women (unlike the Oxford school).

Vrooman then proceeded to attempt to buy the major businesses in the town buying three grocery stores, a hardware store, drug store—paying for it all in cash via the Western Cooperative Association. The New York Times on April 14, 1902, headlined its article on the development &quot;Buying a Town Outright.&quot; According to the cooperative arrangement, members of the coop who spent at least $300 in one of its stores would receive a dividend at the end of the year.

The Ruskin experiment collapsed in 1903 when town residents resisted the Utopian business model and Vrooman&#x27;s wife divorced him saying that he had squandered $250,000 of her money. Miller moved the college to the Chicago suburb of Glen Ellyn, Illinois in 1903 where it consolidated 12 different colleges and had an enrollment of 2,500 with 8,000 correspondence students. Friction quickly arose there also and the main school burned after being struck by lightning.

Miller moved the college again in 1906 to Ruskin, Florida where of land around Trenton was swapped for . Many of the Florida campus buildings burned in 1918 and when Miller died in 1919, the college ceased to exist.

In 1925, Trenton Junior College was established (which is now North Central Missouri College). Through expansion projects and support from numerous people, North Central Missouri College (NCMC) has developed into a major agricultural and nursing educational institution for the state of Missouri. Construction additions have since added to the size of the main campus. Plus directly south of Trenton, a project completed in 2011 established a satellite agricultural location known as the Barton Farm Campus. It contains three classroom buildings, a wind turbine, two acre pond and numerous test plots all on 138 acres of farm ground given to NCMC by the Barton family.

==Superfund sites==
Trenton has two hazardous waste dump sites. One is on the property of Modine Manufacturing, a plant that makes automobile radiators. Modine has produced a variety of acid, lead, and copper-bearing waste products which in previous decades were buried on site and also at a public dump a mile north east of the plant.

<doc id="122722" wikidata="Q831200" url="?curid=122722" title="Bethany, Missouri">
<text>Bethany is a city in, and the county seat of, Harrison County, Missouri, United States, approximately midway between Kansas City and Des Moines on Interstate 35. The population was 2,915 at the 2020 census.

==History==
European settlement of Harrison County began &quot;circa&quot; 1838, although the land was not surveyed and opened for entry until 1842. The county is named after Albert C. Harrison, a 19th-century Missouri political figure. Many of the early settlers to the area homesteaded along Sugar Creek and in the Bethany area. Three commissioners deliberated for several days to determine a site for the county seat, and voted to site it in the southern part of the county. The original name of the community was Dallas.

In June 1845, John S. Allen was appointed to survey the town into lots and offer the same for sale. The plat, covering 19 acres (7.7 hectare), was completed on June 27, 1845.

The first home constructed in the community was built by John S. Allen. Although built as a residence, it was primarily used to store the first stock of goods brought to the community. It was destroyed by fire in 1864.
The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad reached Bethany in 1880. Two other railroad lines were also later laid into the county. The railroad influenced the economy and environment of the community until the early 1980s, when the last train pulled out of the Bethany Depot and the tracks were removed. Transportation was an important industry to the community and the population grew to its greatest level around the turn of the century when over 24,000 persons lived in Harrison County.

Industry played a vital role in Bethany&#x27;s growth starting with Colonel C.L. Jennings who erected the first steam mill around 1854 in the northwest part of town; it produced both lumber and flour. Because the country was so new, little need for towns existed. For several years, only a few retail shops existed and development and growth of the town was slow but by 1855, Bethany was known as one of the best trading places in Northwest Missouri. An industrial park was established in the 1940s by the Harrison County Industrial Development Authority; the Bethany Memorial Airport was opened in 1944. The first tenant in the industrial park was Calhoun Manufacturing, making agriculture machinery. Lambert Manufacturing opened a facility in 1971 and Place&#x27;s Discount Stores also became a resident of the industrial park until 2001 when they sold to Pamida, with the distribution center remaining active in the park until its 2002 closure. The 120,000 square foot building was purchased by the home grown Bethany business Gumdrop Books following Pamida&#x27;s closure. Later additions to the park include Superior Waste, and Tri-State Carports, which opened for business in 2001. The 1990s were a period of aggressive growth, especially within the service industry with the addition of several motels and restaurants. There has been several million dollars investment each year during the 90&#x27;s and an increase of nearly 100 jobs annually.

Through the years, development continued and included the construction of a lake in 1935 to serve the water needs of the community. In 1960, a second lake was added so that Bethany could meet the increasing water needs. The Harrison County Lake was completed in 1994 and provides a third source of water for the community. In 1954, residents voted to issue bonds to build a municipal swimming pool. Numerous other utilities were upgraded from 1930 to 1970 including the construction of a water tower in 1989 to serve growth along the north side of town. In 1996, residents approved a sales tax to extend water lines from the new tower to the south side of town which resulted in a looping of the system and improved water pressure for many areas. The sales tax also funded the reconstruction of Main Street from Highway 69 to the square.

Transportation, which played an important role early in Bethany&#x27;s history, came to play an even bigger role in the 1960s when Interstate 35 was constructed. This north-south four-lane highway connects Canada with Mexico. The interstate ran along the east side of town and since the completion of the interstate in the early 1970s, the community&#x27;s growth has been in that direction.

The Hamilton House and Slatten House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Bethany Falls Limestone==

A limestone outcropping on Big Creek west of town gives its name to the Bethany Falls Limestone formation. The falls no longer exist and only a small amount of stone remains exposed. However the formation extends through Kansas City, Missouri and limestone is used extensively in buildings in that city and the formation is the basis for Subtropolis. The formation got its name in an 1862 study by G.C. Broadhead, who performed many of the geological surveys for Missouri at the time.

==Geography==
Bethany is located in west central Harrison County. Big Creek flows past the western portion of the city. The city is served by I-35, U.S. 136 and U.S. 69.

<text>Clinton is a city in and the county seat of Henry County, Missouri, United States. The population was 9,174 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Clinton was laid out in 1836. The city was named for New York Governor DeWitt Clinton, a key promoter of the Erie Canal. A post office called Clinton has been in operation since 1850. The railroad reached Clinton in 1870, when the Census put the population at 840.

Clinton was incorporated as the least-populous type of city in Missouri, a fourth-class city, in 1878. All but one voter voted in favor of incorporation. Resident Banton G. Boone, a Democrat, was Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives, 1875–1877, and Missouri Attorney General, 1885–1889.

Piped water, electricity, and macadam roads were brought in during the 1880s, and a telephone system in the 1890s.

In 1905, Clinton and the rest of Henry County held two separate votes on prohibition of alcohol. Clinton&#x27;s vote was against prohibition, while the rest of the county voted in favor, creating two separate legal regimes. In 1909, another such local option vote in Clinton gave the same result, against prohibition.

The town square, the focal point of the Clinton Square Historic District, has been the site of various disasters. In 1876, a fire burned down a number of buildings on the square. The cause is believed to have been arson. On June 26, 2006, a building there collapsed while an Elks Lodge meeting was taking place, leading to the death of the Lodge&#x27;s leader, Tony Komer. Nine people were pulled from the rubble, while the rest left on their own power. In the Olde Glory Days parade, which occurred less than one week after the accident, Komer was memorialized and Elk&#x27;s Lodge members from many parts of Western Missouri marched to show their support for the Clinton Lodge.

In addition to the Historic District overall, the Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association Building, William F. and Julia Crome House, Judge Jerubial Gideon Dorman House, Gustave C. Haysler House, and C.C. Williams House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History and name==
Tightwad was originally called Edgewood, for the woods near the original town site.

The village&#x27;s unusual name is said to stem from an episode in which a store owner cheated a customer, who was a postman, by charging him an extra 50 cents for a better watermelon. Some sources claim the transaction involved a rooster rather than a watermelon. 
Due to its proximity to Truman Reservoir, Tightwad saw some limited growth starting in the mid-1980s. As of 2010, the village&#x27;s business district included a bank (see below), café, tavern, and convenience store. As of April 2019, the bank is now closed and is being used for personal use.

==Tightwad Bank==
The first Tightwad Bank opened in 1984 as a branch of the Citizens Bank of Windsor (Windsor, Missouri) at first housed in a portable trailer then eventually a one-story brick building still in use today.(Now currently out of business) Publicity over the unusual name eventually led to deposits totalling over $2 million. However an expected business boom from nearby Truman Reservoir never materialized and the bank fell victim to armed robbery twice in the 1990s. Thus in November 2006, UMB, the bank&#x27;s owner at the time, announced that the Tightwad branch bank would close, and accounts would be shuffled to UMB locations in Warsaw and Clinton, Missouri.&lt;br&gt;
In May 2008, Tightwad Bank was reopened under new ownership, as an FDIC insured institution. The bank was a full-service branch of the former Reading State Bank, Reading, Kansas. To capitalize on the notoriety of the unusual name, the Reading location&#x27;s name was changed to Tightwad Bank as well. &quot;We&#x27;re seeking the customers with a sense of humor&quot;, admitted bank co-owner Donald Higdon in a 2008 interview with &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In 2010 the two locations of Tightwad Bank reported combined deposits of over $20 million (US). As of July 2018 Tightwad Bank in Tightwad Missouri is closed.

<text>Maitland is a city in Holt County, Missouri, United States. The population was 276 at the 2020 census. At one point the city billed itself as the &quot;Bluegrass Mecca&quot;—home to the largest bluegrass farm in the world.

==History==
Maitland was platted in 1880. The town is named after John Skirving Maitland, who was a surveyor for the Nodaway Valley Railroad (the construction company for the Kansas City, St. Joseph and Council Bluffs Railroad) that arrived in Maitland in 1880 when its superintendent, John Fisk Barnard, purchased the land for the town from John S. and Delila Swope. The railroad would eventually be taken over by the Burlington Northern Railroad before eventually being abandoned.

Maitland is a farming community. One of the farmers from Maitland was David Ward King, inventor and promoter of the King road drag—an invention that essentially was two logs lashed together and dragged behind horse or mule teams that was an effective and inexpensive method to grade dirt roads. It was the horse-drawn forerunner of the modern road grader. The invention came at the time Henry Ford started to mass-produce automobiles. Before its invention, wet country roads became muck and were often nearly impassable. The use of the King Road Drag kept rural roads solid, even when wet, which rendered them passable all the time. These improved rural roads made possible both the advent of the automobile and rural mail delivery.

In the first half of the 20th century, Maitland claimed to have the largest bluegrass seed producing farm in the world. John Q. Weller was to claim that the of seed produced on his farm was more than the harvested seed output of the entire state of Kentucky. In some years, Weller would get permission to pile up bumper crops of seed on the city streets. During the harvest time in late June/early July, the town hosted a Bluegrass festival.

Bluegrass seed production in the late 1950s/early 1960s moved to farming communities in Idaho, Oregon and Washington. The Festival had been discontinued.

In 1975 the Maitland Community Betterment Association celebrated the bluegrass stripping heritage with the slogan, &quot;Home of the Strippers.&quot;

===Protected areas===

Mound City benefits economically from the Loess Bluffs National Wildlife Refuge, which is about from the city. Since spring snow geese migration numbers first topped one million in March 2008, Mound City and the surrounding area have benefited from the nearly 300,000 visitors they have attracted, including thousands of hunters who hunt in the stubble of corn fields that surround the refuge.

The refuge is estimated to add about $2.6 million to the economies of Holt and Buchanan counties. Hunting is prohibited on the 7,500-acre refuge, but not in the corn fields where the geese feed, which surround the refuge.

<text>Franklin is a city in Howard County, Missouri, United States. It is located along the Missouri River in the central part of the state. Located in a rural area, the city had a population of 70 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Columbia, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area.

As the eastern terminus of the Santa Fe Trail, the community played a major role in the westward expansion of the United States.

==History==
The town of Franklin was founded by European Americans in 1816 and named for Founding Father Benjamin Franklin of the United States. William Becknell, who is now known as the &quot;Father of the Santa Fe Trail,&quot; lived on a farm a few miles northwest of Franklin. There was a spring near Becknell&#x27;s property, Boone Lick Spring.

The spring had saline water and attracted people from St. Louis and points east, who came to distill the water for its salt. They came so often that they created a trail, calling it Boone&#x27;s Lick Road. &quot;Boone&quot; refers to Nathan and Daniel Morgan Boone, sons of explorer Daniel Boone. The brothers first operated the saltlick business.

In 1821, William Becknell put a notice in the &quot;Missouri Intelligencer,&quot; announcing that he was organizing a party to go &quot;westward, for the purpose of trading for horses and mules and catching wild animals of every description.&quot; On September 1, 1821, his party crossed the Missouri River at Arrow Rock and set out along what would become known in a few years as the Santa Fe Trail. There had long been trade along this way: years before the US acquired the Louisiana Purchase, the Chouteau family of St. Louis had been granted a fur trading monopoly with the Spanish at Santa Fe.

But the following year, Becknell searched for a path that would be wide enough for wagons and draft teams, to accommodate more trade. This improvement was integral to the growth of the Santa Fe Trail for use by both traders and the emigrants of the 1830s who moved on by various branches to the territories of the West: the future states of Oregon, California, and Washington.

In 1827, a devastating flood of the Missouri River destroyed much of Franklin. Residents rebuilt a short distance away on higher ground, creating New Franklin, Missouri.

The Cedar Grove was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

===Kit Carson===
Born in Madison County, Kentucky, near the city of Richmond, Kit Carson migrated as a boy with his family to Franklin, where he was raised. Lindsey Carson was a farmer of Scots-Irish descent who had fought in the Revolutionary War under General Wade Hampton. He had a total of fifteen surviving children: five by his first wife, and ten by Rebecca Robinson, his second wife and Kit&#x27;s mother. The Carson family settled on a tract of land owned by the sons of Daniel Boone, who had purchased the land from the Spanish during their brief period of rule here after the Seven Years&#x27; War. This was prior to the United States annexing the territory following its Louisiana Purchase of 1803 from France.

Carson was eight when his father was killed by a falling tree while clearing land. The father&#x27;s death reduced the Carson family to a desperate poverty. Young Kit dropped out of school to work on the family farm, and to assist in hunting. At the age of 14, Kit was apprenticed to a saddlemaker (Workman&#x27;s Saddleshop) in Franklin. The town was considered the eastern terminus of the Santa Fe Trail, which had opened two years earlier. Many of the customers at the saddleshop were trappers and traders, from whom Kit would hear stirring tales of the Far West. Carson is reported to have found working in the saddle shop to be suffocating: he once said &quot;the business did not suit me, and I concluded to leave&quot;. Around 1826, aged 16, Kit secretly signed on with a large, merchant, Santa Fe-bound caravan in Franklin purportedly wagon-mastered by Stephen Turley and Jesse B. Turley, friends from nearby Lamine.

<doc id="122758" wikidata="Q966271" url="?curid=122758" title="West Plains, Missouri">
<text>West Plains is a city in and the county seat of Howell County, Missouri, United States. The population was 12,184 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The history of West Plains can be traced back to 1832, when settler Josiah Howell (after whom Howell County is named) created the first settlement in the region known as Howell Valley. West Plains was so named because the settlement was on a prairie in a westerly direction from the nearest town, Thomasville.

The Courthouse Square Historic District, Elledge Arcade Buildings, International Shoe Company Building, Mount Zion Lodge Masonic Temple, W. J. and Ed Smith Building, and West Plains Bank Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===The American Civil War===
The location of West Plains led to nearly constant conflict due to the proximity to what was then the border between the Union and Confederacy. West Plains was largely burned to the ground, and Howell County as a whole was devastated. No major battles occurred in West Plains or Howell County, but much of the devastation came from constant guerrilla warfare.

Confederate Brigadier General James Haggin McBride gave residents an ultimatum to either join the Confederate army or to flee the area. An overwhelming majority of Howell County residents chose to flee, and over 90% of the population had fled by the time the war was over. Many, however, also chose to fight for the Confederacy, as McBride promised to protect his soldiers&#x27; property and loved ones. Men who spoke out against the Confederacy were arrested, as martial law had been declared by McBride.

South Carolina native, and West Plains resident, William Monks, was a scout for the &quot;North&quot; (Union army) and recounted his tales of the Civil War in his 1907 book &quot;A History of Southern Missouri and Northern Arkansas.&quot; In that memoir, Monks recounts many depredations that occurred during the war and how the Confederates referred to those faithful to the Union as &quot;lopeared Dutch&quot; (many Missourians who were &quot;Union men&quot; were German).

===20th century===
In 1903, African Americans were driven out of West Plains under threat of violence.

===The Great Depression era===
As was the case with many other locations, the Great Depression hit West Plains in the 1930s. Citizens had little knowledge of what was going on with the national scene, except for what Neathery says in his book, &quot;every place was a boom town, [but] in some places things were going bust as well.&quot; The first bank to fail in West Plains was the Farmers Savings Bank in West Plains circa 1926, and the lack of the present-day Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation meant that some people initially lost whatever wealth was deposited.

====West Plains Dance Hall explosion====
On April 13, 1928, for reasons still unknown, a violent explosion occurred in downtown West Plains. About 60 people had gathered in the Bond Dance Hall, which was on the second floor of a building on East Main Street. The explosion was reported to be felt for miles, even in Pomona, which is approximately ten miles from West Plains. Windows were shattered throughout the block, and cars were also warped on the street. The explosion also damaged the nearby Howell County Courthouse so badly that it was vacated and left until late 1933, when it was demolished by the Civil Works Administration. Thirty-seven people were killed in the explosion, and 22 people were injured. Twenty of those killed were never positively identified, but buried in a mass grave at Oak Lawn Cemetery in the southeast part of town. They are memorialized by the Rock of Ages monument, erected on October 6, 1929. The explosion has also been remembered in a folk song recorded 30 years later.

The cause of the explosion is still a topic of controversy nearly a century after the blast. Numerous causes for the explosion have been offered, but a definitive story has never been proven to be true. The most widely accepted theory is that the explosion somehow originated from leaking gasoline in a garage owned by J. W. Wiser, which happened to be on the floor below. Because Wiser was at the garage at the time, some have speculated that the blast was intentionally caused by Wiser as a suicide attempt, which his wife reportedly refused to acknowledge. In addition, the late West Plains native Robert Neathery explained in his 1994 book, &quot;West Plains As I Knew It&quot;, that a truck containing dynamite parked in the garage may have been the cause, indirectly part of a crime in which someone shot Wiser and set a fire to cover up the crime, and the dynamite exploded.

The event is fictionalized in the short novel &quot;The Maid&#x27;s Version&quot; by Daniel Woodrell, which is about a similar dance hall explosion in the fictional town of West Table.

===West Plains Badgers===
In 1936, West Plains gained its own Minor League Baseball team named the West Plains Badgers within the Northeast Arkansas League. They would move the same year to Caruthersville, Missouri where they became the Caruthersville Pilots. In 1940, they would move to Batesville, Arkansas, where they were known as the Batesville Pilots. The team disbanded in 1941.

===After the Depression===
In 1954, following &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, city leaders voted unanimously to desegregate the school system. The Lincoln School, a one-room school for African-Americans closed down, and its students were transferred elsewhere. The building itself was given to the city. A local couple, Crockett and Tonya Oaks III, bought the building in 2023 and restored it, partnering with the Missouri Historical Society and Missouri History Museum and commissioning art from local artist Heather Legler and Nigerian muralist Dr. Bolaji Ogunwo.

On the evening of April 2, 1982, a long-track F4 tornado struck the West Plains area, beginning in Ozark County and ending near what was the airport at the time. Many homes and businesses were significantly damaged or leveled by the tornado, which killed three and injured at least 28 as it hit the West Plains Country Club and nearby homes, as well as businesses located on U.S. Route 63.

The downtown area of West Plains, namely Court Square, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 2003. The Downtown Revitalization Economic Assistance for Missouri (DREAM) Act also opened up funding for renovations and improvements for certain downtown buildings.

==Geography==
West Plains is located at (36.737355, −91.864991). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
West Plains is characterized by four distinct seasons and is located near the northern border of a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), as defined by the Köppen climate classification system; as such, West Plains tends to be exceptionally humid in the late summer. On average, there are 44.6 days with highs over , 3.3 with highs over , 11.8 days where the temperature does not rise above freezing, and 1.3 with lows below .

The West Plains area is served by U.S. Route 63, which runs along the western and southern edges of the city. U.S. 63 is a four-lane expressway from the 60/63 interchange near Cabool to Route ZZ in the extreme southeastern part of West Plains, then becomes a 2+1 road going southeast. Route 63&#x27;s path through the city is often colloquially referred to as &quot;the bypass&quot;, and is officially known as Jan Howard Expressway between Porter Wagoner Boulevard and Bill Virdon Boulevard. There are nine traffic lights along U.S. 63, with the newest one being at 5th street, near the hospital, which was added in 2022. One exit exists on U.S. 63 in the city near McFarland Street, which allows drivers to exit onto Business Route 63.

It enters city limits near the Southern Hills business district, where it is named Preacher Roe Boulevard to its intersection with Main Street. Preacher Roe Boulevard, named after longtime West Plains resident and former baseball player Preacher Roe, has four lanes to its intersection with U.S. 63. The route follows U.S. 63 to Gibson Avenue, where it turns right crossing Porter Wagoner Boulevard and becoming Missouri Avenue, a left onto Concord Road, and a right onto Independence Dr, which becomes Joe Jones Boulevard, after which the route exits city limits and carries traffic on a two-lane route toward Alton.

In addition to U.S. Routes 63 and 160, West Plains is also served by Routes 14 and 17 and Routes K, CC, JJ, PP, ZZ, AB, and BB. Many traffic lights in the city were recently upgraded to have flashing-yellow arrow signals for left-turning intersections.

<doc id="122769" wikidata="Q953050" url="?curid=122769" title="Lake Lotawana, Missouri">
<text>Lake Lotawana is a city in Jackson County, Missouri, United States and is located 35 miles southeast of downtown Kansas City bordering Blue Springs and Lee’s Summit. The population was 2,310 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

The city derives its name from the lake that takes up most of the city, which is said to be named after an Indian princess.

==History==
Lake Lotawana was conceived, purchased, built and developed by Milton Thompson, owner of nearby Highland Farms, the world&#x27;s largest Hereford cattle breeding farm at that time (1927). He had previously developed nearby Lake Tapawingo, a lake community with retreats for wealthy Kansas City businessmen. Permission for the new lake was requested November 7, 1927 and surveying was completed June 13, 1928. The dam was completed in the fall of 1929 just before the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression. An extended drought meant the lake did not fill completely until the Spring of 1935. Early land sales were slow due to the Depression.

Lake Lotawana was named after a fabled Native American princess whose name meant &quot;sparkling water&quot;. The legend of Princess Lotawana tells of her life in the Catskill Mountains of New York. In her legend, she was murdered on her wedding day by a jealous spurned suitor.

The area of Sni-A-Bar creek that later became Lake Lotawana was used as a hideout and staging area by Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders during the Civil War. This band of irregulars conducted raids against Union Army units and pro-Union and Abolitionist residents of Missouri and Kansas. There are accounts that they engaged in the Battle of Quantrill&#x27;s Cove on August 13, 1862, where they defeated a Union Cavalry force under Major Emory L. Foster. Accounts of the incident are not clear, but this engagement was a spillover from the Battle of Lone Jack. This battle was supposed to have taken place near present-day Quantrill&#x27;s Cove, near the west end of the lake. Quantrill&#x27;s group also staged the famous and better known raid against Lawrence, Kansas, known as the Lawrence massacre on August 21, 1863. The brutality of the raid resulted in the Order No. 11 by Union Brigadier General Thomas C. Ewing, garrisoned in present-day Kansas City. This order resulted in the forced relocation of all Confederate sympathizers in four counties, including the area of present-day Lake Lotawana. It was meant to clear the counties of a civilian support structure, and resulted in much property loss by the residents of the area. Most homes were burnt to the ground and people had to leave with little more than the clothes on their backs and what they could load into a wagon. The band of Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders continued their efforts to harass the Union forces after the order was implemented. There were rumors that stolen property from the raid on Lawrence was buried by Quantrill&#x27;s men in or near the Sni-a-Bar creek valley that later became Lake Lotawana. Treasure Cove in the C Block of the lake was named in reference to the buried treasure.

After the Civil War, settlers returned to the area, mostly developing the surrounding area as farms. Sni-A-Bar creek remained a heavily timbered valley, not as suitable for crops or livestock. There was a sulphur spring in block T inside Gate 3 that was a site of picnics and revivals. Most famously, the Baptist Minister Joab Powell of the Union Church (near the modern day intersection of 7 and 50 highways) would hold revivals in what is now called Waterfall Cove. The church was destroyed by a tornado in 1894.

Milton Thompson purchased much of the land, employing Oliver Sheley to survey the lake. He later resided at C-23 until his death in 1967. Originally, the lake had locked gates, with guards stationed to check for passes. Many of the original homes were cabins, made of logs, meant for summer vacation dwellings only. A mixture of summer cabins and permanent dwellings were built through the 1930s. The dam required many repairs and upgrades through the 1930s and 1940s, including the first WPA project in Jackson County, Missouri.

Early organization of the area was managed by the Lake Lotawana Development Company.[7] The city was incorporated into a fourth class city on November 24, 1958.

<text>Raytown is a city in Jackson County, Missouri, United States, and is a suburb of Kansas City. The population was at 30,012 in 2020 census. The current mayor of Raytown is Michael McDonough. It is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

==History==

The area where Raytown now lies was developed throughout the 19th century and early 20th century as pioneers moved westward along the Three Trails in search of available fertile lands and water. It was added to the state of Missouri at a cost of $800 by a treaty signed in 1826. Jackson County, named after President Andrew Jackson, was formed in 1827.

A large section of the county, Township 49, was accidentally not offered for sale when the other townships were, and so was called &quot;The Lost Township&quot;. People moved into the township and squatted until the township was surveyed and the land sold in 1843.

The pioneers and travelers moving westward down the Three Trails discovered an area of high, wooded ridges, in the Raytown area, that reminded them of their former homes in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The land was named Blue Ridge, with the bordering bodies of waters called the Big Blue and the Little Blue rivers.

The Rice-Tremonti Home, which still stands in Raytown today, was built on the Santa Fe Trail in 1844 by Archibald Rice and his family.

William Ray established a blacksmith shop on the Santa Fe Trail in Jackson County in about 1848. The settlement around the blacksmith shop was known first as &quot;Ray&#x27;s Town&quot; and later as &quot;Raytown&quot; in 1854. (Now Fox&#x27;s Drugs)

There is now a historical marker in Raytown at the corner of 63rd Street and Raytown Road showing the location of William Ray&#x27;s shop.

In 1860, residents of Jackson County petitioned the county for a better road to connect southern Jackson County with Independence in northern Jackson County. The result was Raytown Road, which led north from High Grove Road, crossed the Little Blue River at the &quot;rockford&quot; (now inundated by Longview Lake) and joined the Santa Fe Trail at William Ray&#x27;s blacksmith shop. Many portions of the original Raytown Road still are used today.

<text>Unity Village is a village in Jackson County, Missouri, United States, bordering Kansas City and Lee&#x27;s Summit. It is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. Its population was 99 at the 2010 census. The founders of the Unity spiritual movement, Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, purchased a 58-acre farm in 1919 as a weekend getaway for employees of their downtown Kansas City headquarters. In March 1920, the land came to be known as Unity Farm, and the following purchase of 12 surrounding farms expanded the land to nearly 1,500 acres.

The farm produced fruits and vegetables, including 7,500 apple trees, a 400-tree peach orchard, 12 acres of grapevines, cherry and plum trees, and fields of oats, corn, wheat, strawberries, asparagus, and soybeans. Unity Farm also supported a poultry house containing 2,000 white leghorn hens, whose eggs helped sustain a meatless menu at the Unity Inn cafeteria downtown.

The Fillmores’ work was consolidated at Unity Village after World War II, and it is now the world headquarters for the ongoing spiritual movement. On March 15, 1953, the State of Missouri officially incorporated the land as Unity Village. In the 2010 census, its population was 99.

The Unity Village is a campus with historic buildings. The grounds dwellings in the English Cotswold style as well as Mediterranean-inspired buildings designed by Waldo Rickert Fillmore (also known as Rickert), the second son of Charles and Myrtle Fillmore. The Tower and an office building then used for the Silent Unity Prayer Ministry opened in 1929 and are on the National Register of Historic Places.

Unity Village is also home to two artificial lakes. Lake Charles R. Fillmore (named for the grandson of the Unity cofounders) was created in 1926 to supply water to the farm and orchard that Unity maintained until the 1980s. A crew of 100 men built a concrete buttress dam, the only one of its kind in Missouri and one of the few west of the Mississippi River, at a cost of $100,000 to form the lake. The lake is 42 feet deep and covers 21 surface acres, holding about 75 million gallons of water. It remains the primary water supply for the Village today, and its water is pumped to the on-campus water treatment plant.

<text>Avilla is a rural village in Jasper County, Missouri, United States. The population was 103 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. Avilla is the fourth-oldest settlement in Jasper County today, founded in 1856. It was platted and laid out for public use July 23, 1858, by Andrew L. Love and David S. Holman.

==Geography==
Avilla is located at (37.193821, −94.128991), ten miles east of Carthage, Missouri, on MO Route 96 (formerly Historic U.S. Route 66) and four miles west of the Lawrence County line. The village is surrounded by pasture and farmland, small forested areas and branching spring-fed streams. White Oak Creek is the nearest to the south and east, and Dry Fork &amp; Deer Creek to the north. Spring River runs past about three miles to the south which is eventually fed by these headwater streams.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==History==
===1831–1861===

====Founders of Avilla====
Pioneers who came to this region in the 1830s and 1840s saw a &quot;beautiful prairie land, interspersed with timbered belts along winding streams&quot;. Settlement of the grasslands presented more challenges than other types of terrain, and for this reason northeastern Jasper County developed more slowly than the rest of the county. Split-log homes were built near wooded locations and rock and sod were also used in early constructions. Although families were many miles apart, they still called each other neighbor. Some of the earliest settlers near present-day Avilla were John K. Gibson in 1831 (just across the Lawrence County line), James Blackwell in 1835 and John Fishburn on White Oak Creek in 1836. Nelson Knight was the first settler on the prairie north of Avilla, building a cabin and farm in 1837, and Jasper County itself was established in 1841. Thomas Buck came all the way from Indiana in a wagon drawn by a team of horses in the 1840s and built a farm just east of the future town site. The first schoolhouse in the Avilla area was a one-room, dirt-floor log cabin also founded in the 1840s, called White Oak School, located about southeast near White Oak Creek. Arriving with his family in 1853, Dr. Jaquillian M. Stemmons was the first physician to practice medicine in the Avilla area, doing so from his farm. The town of Avilla was founded in 1856 and platted and laid out for public use July 23, 1858, by Andrew L. Love and David S. Holman. Mr. Love was the first Justice of the Peace, and Mr. Holman was the first merchant and postmaster, establishing the post office in 1860. A &quot;Dr Young&quot; later came just before the Civil War and established a medical office within the town limits.

====Indigenous People====

This had been the hunting grounds of the Osage Indians who were known to have camped at nearby Spring River, about to the south. Their lands to the east had been previously purchased by the government in 1808 (Treaty of Fort Clark) and other tribes had been moved to this location as well, and then later all were moved again to the Osage Nation areas elsewhere. Notwithstanding, a few that possibly returned or had simply refused to leave could still be seen trading in Avilla and the nearby towns throughout the Antebellum Period.

====Avilla at the Beginning of the Civil War====

By 1861 there were several small river mill settlements, some mining camps and about nine or ten towns (seven platted) in Jasper County, Missouri. Avilla was newly formed and &quot;bustling&quot; with over one hundred citizens (compare with the county seat of Carthage that had an estimated population between four and five hundred at that time). As in all of the border state towns, families in Avilla were split over the question of Missouri secession, and some were slave owners. Dr. Jaquillian M. Stemmons actually owned eight inherited slaves himself; however, he and the other town leaders were Unconditional Unionists and remained aligned with newly elected president Abraham Lincoln. Dr. J.M. Stemmons never bought or sold slaves and was known to have retained his family inherited slaves simply for their very own safety. He supported the abolition of slavery in the United States. Avilla&#x27;s political alignment was in sharp contrast to neighboring Sarcoxie to the south, where the first regional Confederate flag was raised. The rebel &quot;Stars &amp; Bars&quot; also flew over Carthage to the west in 1861, following an early Confederate victory at the Battle of Carthage on July 5. At a distance of only two counties away, Arkansas had already become the ninth state to secede, and on October 28, 1861, Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson met with the Missouri General Assembly in Neosho and declared Missouri as the twelfth state to join the Confederate States of America. In spite of being engulfed by the Confederacy, the United States flag continued to fly over Avilla, boldly hoisted to the top of a flagpole in the town center park and guarded by the townsmen. Schoolhouses were closed and many families evacuated their women and small children to safer areas in other states.

===1861–1865===

====Confederate guerrillas attack====
Dr. Jaquillian M. Stemmons, an early settler, town leader and staunch Union man, organized a company of local men and neighbors in Avilla for the protection of their own homes from roaming bands of bushwhackers. In 1861 this town militia, also known as the &quot;Avilla Home Guard&quot;, was one of the first in the area and consisted predominantly of the oldest citizens, as most of the younger men were leaving to join regular military forces. This action was strongly opposed by local secessionists, and it was even rumored that a price had been placed on the doctor&#x27;s head. By March 1862, the town militia had been tipped off about an impending assault and General James G. Blunt at Fort Scott, Kansas, had pledged reinforcements, but they had not yet arrived. After nightfall on March 8, 1862, a group of over a hundred pro-Confederate guerrillas believed to have been led by William T. Anderson attacked northeast of Avilla, routed perimeter sentries and engaged defenders at Dr. Stemmon’s home. Defending were about twenty five town militiamen and some men from Carthage who were there attending a meeting about the organization of a county-wide patrol. A US Cavalry officer named Captain Tanner was also there recruiting men for the Union Army. The rebels surrounded the two-story log home and were met with heavy gunfire, but the doctor and three of his sons, Bud, Pole and Jimmie were trapped inside with many of the men. After numerous attempts to penetrate the defense, amidst flying buckshot and bullets, the attackers managed to ignite the cabin and it eventually burned to the ground. Dr. Stemmons and Lathan Duncan, an Avilla militiaman, were killed, several others shot and burned, and two were taken prisoner (the number of guerrilla casualties was not recorded). After the house was lost to flames, the heavily out-numbered militia withdrew and scattered in the darkness. They re-formed near the north edge of Avilla and braced for another onslaught, but it did not occur. The guerrilla force instead ended the attack and rode east toward Springfield, where the two elderly prisoners were later &quot;given stern warnings to leave the state&quot; and released.

Dr. J.M. Stemmons had been considered an &quot;influential area figure against secession&quot;, and this was thought to be a chief motive for the attack and his murder. Nevertheless, the &quot;defiant and heroic actions&quot; of Dr. Stemmons, Mr. Duncan and the town militia&#x27;s &quot;bold resistance&quot; undoubtedly repelled further violence and probably prevented the burning of Avilla on that or ensuing dates. Names that are known of the courageous militiamen and allies defending on that night also included: Miles Overton, George Moose, Jap Moody, Ben Key, Cavalry Chapman, Robert Seymour, Orange Clark, Humphrey Robinson, Tom Driver, James S. Carter, Reuben Fishburn, William Club (seriously wounded), Nelson Knight (taken prisoner), Rabe Paul and Coleman Paul, Isaac Schooler, &quot;Dutch&quot; Brown (taken prisoner), Nip Walker, Peter Baker, Renard Napper and Cpt. Tanner from Fort Scott (The Captain was a Union Army Recruiting Officer and reportedly continued to fight after taking a shotgun blast to the face).

Humphrey Robinson (1812–1864) was later abducted by bushwackers from his Lawrence County, Missouri, farm, in 1864, and never seen again. Many, at the time, believed he was recognized by his captors as one who stood against them in the defense of Avilla and killed in retaliation. A marker to his memory was laid beside his widow at Gray&#x27;s Point Cemetery, near Miller, Missouri.

====A Gruesome Warning to Bushwhackers====

The rebel attack on the Stemmons home was intended to terrorize and diffuse but essentially had the opposite effect, infuriating the townsmen and altering the defensive efforts to offensive as everyone in Avilla took up arms. The Union Army gained possession of Missouri in 1862, but the terrain encompassing Avilla remained plagued with bushwhackers and occasionally small bands of Confederate regulars or guerrilla raiders on horseback. The town militia inherently became the earliest county militia for a period, headquartered in Avilla (this was before the formation of the Missouri County Militias in 1864). The patrol areas were then extended within eastern Jasper and western Lawrence Counties. Patrols of mounted militiamen were augmented by a few Union soldiers of the US Cavalry and continued to protect the town and countryside in several local skirmishes. Many bushwackers were tracked down and shot, and within a short time the rest of them grew to fear the deadly Avilla &quot;pioneer marksmen&quot;. In one account a rebel’s skeleton was found just south of town with a bullet hole in the skull and his name was never identified. He had apparently been killed during a previous skirmish with militiamen, but his remains were not found until they were in an advanced state of decomposition. The skull was then hung from the &quot;Death Tree&quot; in Avilla, suspended from a tree limb for over a year near the road at the Dunlap apple orchard &quot;as a warning to all other bushwhackers&quot;.

====Union Army Garrison at Avilla====

By 1863, the Enrolled Missouri Militia was stationed at the Union Army garrison in Avilla; these new soldiers were under the command of Major Morgan. Tents were erected and storehouses, barns and homes were converted to temporary Army barracks &amp; headquarters which housed hundreds of soldiers at various times, and a number of refugees. The town became known to the Missouri Militiamen informally as &quot;Camp Avilla&#x27;&quot;, and by 1864 many of the original town militiamen continued to assist the new Missouri Militia functioning as patrol leaders in the newly organized Jasper County Militia. Avilla supported anti-guerrilla operations in the region while under Lieutenant-Colonel T.T. Crittenden of the Missouri State Militia&#x27;s 7th Cavalry, and facilitated as a way station when needed in the transportation of Confederate Prisoners of War. Being situated in open grassland Avilla was able to maintain a formidable and effective defense and became a sanctuary for refugees of nearby burned-out towns such as Carthage, but the county remained dangerous until the end and even for some time after the war.

===1865–1900===

====Boom town during the Reconstruction Era====

Avilla fended off and avoided destruction during the Civil War, and was an overnight boom town during the Reconstruction Era at war&#x27;s end. Merchandise and construction materials were hauled by wagon train from Sedalia, Missouri, the closest railroad shipping point to Avilla. Much of Jasper County lay in ruins, and local merchants and businessmen grew wealthy during the rebuilding of Carthage, Sarcoxie, and other nearby war-damaged communities. Many old time residents later claimed that Avilla had actually been the largest operating town in Jasper County after hostilities ended, for a short time. Commerce even came from as far away as Kansas, by farmers traveling to Avilla to buy seed, building supplies and provisions. Captain Thomas Jefferson Stemmons, a Union commander and son of the late Dr. J.M. Stemmons, returned home to Avilla and started a mercantile with partner D. B. Rives, which was the first new business established after the Civil War. The first hotel was called The Avilla House and was erected two years later in 1868 by Justice Hall. Through the 1870s and 1880s there were two general stores (dry goods &amp; clothing), two grocery stores, one or more doctor&#x27;s offices, one &quot;notion&quot; (sewing) store, two boot &amp; shoe stores, one livery &amp; feed stable, three churches, a drug store, a Grand Army of the Republic post (GAR) and two &quot;secret societies&quot;: the Freemasons Lodge and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Lodge (IOOF) and houses sprang up everywhere. Located at what is now named &quot;School Street&quot;, the first Avilla school in town was built in the 1880s and taught grades 1–12 (called lower, upper and high school). Sources disagree, but some documents cite the town&#x27;s population at over five hundred during these years, not including families on the farms encircling just beyond the town limits. Despite the initial spurt after the Civil War, growth of the town was stunted because the railroad was not built through Avilla. Farmland was the primary natural resource and without industry the population never increased after this time, and regular stage lines were eventually discontinued.

====Avilla Zouaves in the Spanish–American War====
After the battleship USS &quot;Maine&quot; exploded at Havana, Cuba in February 1898, a &quot;war fever&quot; against Spain swept through America with the cry: &quot;Remember the &quot;Maine&quot;!&quot; On March 4, 1898, a highly charged war rally was held at the Avilla Methodist Church. Three attorneys gave rousing speeches to the packed house, fueled with patriotic songs from a ladies choir. As a result, fifty-three young men immediately volunteered for military service in a new company that would be known as the &quot;Avilla Zouaves&quot;. These units were characterized by colorful uniforms and/or precision drilling patterned after the French Zouaves, and were very stylish in the 19th century military. The Avilla youth would be designated in the US Army as Company G, 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment. Two months later, the new Avilla unit was escorted by flag-bearing GAR members to the Carthage Train Depot, and with music from the Light Guard Band were ceremoniously sent off for battle in the Spanish–American War. The fighting in Cuba was over quickly and the 5th Missouri Infantry was mustered out on November 9, 1898, before the Avilla Zouaves saw any action. Although they did not fight in the war, this event illustrates the raw patriotic spirit of Avilla, Missouri, still present in 1898.

===1900–1970===

====The Bank of Avilla and Robbery of 1932====
The Bank of Avilla was established September 18, 1914, and the building was completed in 1915. Samuel Salyer was the first majority stockholder and cashier (the title &quot;cashier&quot; was applied to bank officers &amp; managers). Mr. Ivy E. Russell became majority stockholder and cashier in 1919, remaining for its duration, with the stock ledger ending in 1944. Handling farm and business loans, the small bank remained profitable even through the Great Depression of the 1930s, though records are incomplete. This in itself is quite remarkable as almost half of the banks in America had either closed or merged in the 1930s. The productive farms surrounding the town had established Avilla as a valuable agricultural and livestock raising community.

The Bank of Avilla was the target of a successful armed robbery on May 18, 1932, by members of the notorious &quot;Irish O&#x27;Malley Gang&quot;, which also resulted in the kidnapping of the cashier. The O&#x27;Malley Gang were typical Depression-era outlaws who had merged with another group of thugs known as the &quot;Ozark Mountain Boys&quot;. On that Wednesday in 1932, the bank cashier Mr. Ivy E. Russell was robbed at gunpoint inside the bank by two men. He was then kidnapped and driven toward Carthage, Mo, where he was tossed out of the car and left by the roadside. One of the culprits was a &quot;sawed-off shotgun wielding gangster&quot; named Jack Miller, who drove the getaway car. It is not known if the undisclosed amount was ever recovered, and records do not show if or how bank customers were reimbursed (notes and deposits were not insured at this time). After a lengthy spree of bank hold-ups, store robberies and murders throughout the Midwest, all of the O&#x27;Malley Gang were eventually captured. Some gang members were killed or found dead, and one was sentenced to a seventy-five year prison term for the Avilla bank robbery. Additional facts about the crime can be pieced together through various computerized data sources, some of which include: archived editions of the Miami Daily News Record (Oklahoma) dated May 19, 1932, and from The Joplin Globe dated October 8, 1939. In 1938 Frank Layton and Jack Miller were pulled over by police in Arkansas, and were charged with violating the 1934 National Firearms Act (because of Jack&#x27;s sawed-off shotgun). This in turn became part of a famous landmark Second Amendment case known as &quot;The Miller Case&quot; and United States v. Miller. Jack Miller himself was murdered one month prior to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision. Jack&#x27;s bullet-riddled body turned up on the bank of Spencer Creek in Rogers County, Oklahoma.

In spite of having been robbed and kidnapped, Mr. Ivy E. Russell continued to operate the Bank of Avilla for at least twelve more years. A great crime wave of robberies and violence swept across the Midwest in 1932. Following the Avilla caper, Mr. Russell increased security measures by keeping a large caliber firearm behind the teller window, and additional measures that remain a secret to this day. It is known that Bonnie &amp; Clyde of the infamous &quot;Barrow Gang&quot; were near the area in Joplin, Missouri, mere months after the Bank of Avilla robbery by the O&#x27;Malley Gang. The Barrow Gang were undoubtedly &quot;casing-out&quot; banks to rob as well. Local lore has it that Clyde Barrow entered the Bank of Avilla, looked Mr. Russell in the eye, and then saw his .45 holstered while he stood behind the teller window. Clyde allegedly tipped his hat, said &quot;&#x27;Afternoon&quot;, then turned around and promptly left. Though this is local legend, it is safe to assume that many other Depression-era hoodlums passed through town as well. The bank always remained open during normal hours, with Ivy E. Russell as the cashier. The Bank of Avilla was never robbed again.

As more roads were paved and transportation in the vicinity significantly improved, the need for a local bank diminished. At some point around 1944 its assets were transferred to the Bank of Carthage, and the bank building was vacated for a few years. The property was then leased by the government April 1, 1952, to house the old US Post Office which was in need of a new location by that time. The historic building has remained a post office ever since.

====Avilla &quot;Gets Kicks&quot; on Route 66====

The trail that went through the center of Avilla east &amp; west was known as &quot;Old Carthage Road&quot;, and it was paved and became part of U.S. Route 66 in the late 1920s. This kept business flowing as the little town became one of the stops on &quot;The Mother Road&quot;, the main highway through the heart of America in those years. Population growth had already apexed before the 20th century but the town continued to make modern improvements such as a volunteer fire department, a hardware store &amp; lumber yard (owned by Raymond Ziler, burned in 1971), a barbershop, a beauty salon, (Florida Melugin&#x27;s or &quot;Old Flo&#x27;s&quot;) tavern, The Avilla Cafe (Jack &amp; Nadine &quot;Sours&quot; Couch), several auto service stations (in town and close proximity) and repair shops for farm equipment and automobiles, a farm implement sales (Chapman-Follmers), a seed mill, a Boy Scout meeting hall (Scoutmaster Joseph A. Norris Sr.) and in later years even an arena grounds was constructed for the Avilla Rodeo (Avilla Saddle Club) west of town. A larger school building was also built, and the old one-room school houses which were still operating and spread out in that part of Jasper County were consolidated and centralized in Avilla. The original country schoolhouse teachers were brought together to form the elementary/middle school Avilla R-13 School District. The Avilla school became the only one in the district. Because the school spans grades kindergarten though eighth, high school level students thereafter were sent to neighboring Carthage, Sarcoxie, Jasper, Miller or Golden City, Missouri, for continued studies.

===1970 – present===

====Living ghost town====

Avilla had actually started to decline in the 1940s after World War II, when greater numbers of people (especially young adults) from the already small community began moving to larger industrial cities for employment opportunities. The final turning point was in the 1960s, when US Route 66 was bypassed with I-44 (the Interstate Highway System). The lost commerce due to the diverted traffic caused many of the remaining businesses to fail or to be relocated in the 1970s. In 1971 a large fire broke out at the Avilla lumberyard which destroyed several buildings including most of the lumber company, the Boy Scout Meeting Hall and some private residences. The lumberyard was later rebuilt but by the late 1970s deteriorating town shops had been sold &amp; resold, and finally deserted. The only trades that survived were the ones that could be sustained by the dwindling local population and area farming operations. Most of the earliest buildings are now gone, replaced by noticeable empty spaces and vacant lots. US Route 66 was redesignated MO Route 96 in 1985 but by then Avilla was already a small, quiet rural community not unlike what is witnessed there today. Few abandoned structures remain within the present village as silent reminders of the towns heyday.

Avilla is considered one of the living &quot;ghost towns of old Route 66&quot;. It was never completely abandoned and retains its village status today. Many antique country home&#x27; and farmhouses can be seen dotted about the Avilla countryside and long established family traditions in livestock raising and agriculture continue in the area. The rural community with local 4-H clubs &amp; the Harvest Community Church are currently restoring the Avilla Saddle Club Arena. A few examples of period architecture can still be viewed such as the iconic 19th century Avilla (United) Methodist Church which was the first church established in Avilla, located in the northeast part of town. A Civil War era mercantile edifice (Stemmons &amp; Rives) also endures near the old park at the west village entrance. Although it has been threatened with closure because of government cut-backs, 21st century visitors and residents can enjoy the nostalgic and well-preserved 1915 bank building, complete with the old time teller windows, vault and vintage postal equipment as it continues to fly Old Glory and serve as Avilla&#x27;s US Post Office.
The Bank of Avilla was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.

==Notable people==
Homer L. Hall Award-winning American journalist, educator and widely published author of teaching and students&#x27; textbooks, including the critically acclaimed &quot;High School Journalism&quot;. Inducted into the Missouri Interscholastic Press Association Hall of Fame and the National Scholastic Journalism Hall of Fame, he grew up on a farm near Avilla, and graduated in the class of 1956 at Carthage High School.

James M. Craven A state representative of Missouri in Avilla, Craven was born in Indiana in 1831 and became a livestock dealer in California and Oregon in the 1850s. He moved to Avilla and went into politics in 1866.

Walter Stemmons A professor of journalism and university publications editor-in-chief at the University of Connecticut, Stemmons was born in Avilla in 1884.

==Etymology==

It is verified that Avilla, Missouri, was named on or before 1858 because of the plat documentation, but who selected the name and why remains a mystery. The town was founded by Andrew L. Love and David S. Holman, merchant-landowners who basically wanted to sell goods and property at the edge of the frontier in the mid-1850s, but little information was recorded by them, and even less about them. An authentic explanation for the name may exist in an old document or letter, but it has yet to be discovered or made public, and the knowledge may have died with the founders. In the United States, the list of similarly named places includes: a small town in Noble County, Indiana, a township in Comanche County, Kansas, and an unincorporated community in Saline County, Arkansas.

A myth that Avilla, Missouri, was named after Avilla, Indiana, was started in 1930 when it was published in the M.A. thesis from Robert Lee Meyers, University of Missouri-Columbia &quot;Place Names In The Southwest Counties Of Missouri&quot;. Although early settlers did come to Avilla, Missouri, from Indiana, the Indiana town was documented to have been named seventeen years after the Missouri town, by Judge Edwin Randal in 1875. Before that time, Avilla, Indiana, was known as “Hill Town” until 1875.

According to one version of the legend, the phantom is not only searching for his head, but vengeance on the town citizens as well.

<text>Carterville is a city in Jasper County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,855 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
While one James Carter settled in Jasper County in 1841, the land on which Carterville was built was originally owned by his son, James Gilbert Leroy Carter, who created a farm in the 1860’s. The town considers itself founded in 1875, when a post office called Carterville opened that year. However, the settlement was not officially incorporated until 1882. Early Carterville was little more than a lead-mining camp, one of many in the tri-state mining district in southwestern Missouri, southeastern Kansas and northwestern Oklahoma. It nevertheless thrived, and at one time had a population of over 12,000 residents, making it larger than nearby Webb City.

When interurban transportation came to the mining district in 1889, it was in the form of a horsecar line (other sources say a mule road) between Webb City and Carterville. That operation was absorbed in 1892 by the Southwest Missouri Electric Railway Company, later the Southwest Missouri Railroad Company, and by 1894 an electrified streetcar line linked Carterville to Webb City and Joplin in one direction, and Prosperity in the other. Two additional rail lines, that of the Missouri Pacific Railway and the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railway, ran down the west border of Carterville.

The town began its decline in size after World War I, when the mining industry began to dry up.

==Geography==
Carterville&#x27;s main street is the former U.S. Route 66.
