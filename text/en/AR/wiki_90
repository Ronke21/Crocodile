In 1784, the name was changed to Washington and the area was variously referred to as Washington Village, Washington Woods, and Little Washington. The name was considered at the suggestion of Abraham Barkelew, one of the original settlers in the town. In 1870, the name was changed to South River and on February 28, 1898, South River officially became a borough.

===Belarusians in South River===

South River has become a center for Belarusian Americans in the postwar-period.

The first immigrants from present-day Belarus (from the areas of modern-day western Minsk Voblast and Hrodna Voblast, around the towns of Vilejka, Maladziečna and others) arrived to South River in the late 19th century. Most of the immigrants of that time identified themselves as Polish or Russian depending on their faith. Immigrants from Belarus established a Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn (a prominent Catholic icon in Vilnius venerated primarily by Catholics in Western Belarus and Lithuania) and a 250 members strong Russian Orthodox parish of St. Peter and St. Paul.

The postwar immigrants founded the Belarusian Congress Committee of America here in 1951. In the 1950s they reestablished the Belarusian Orthodox parish of St. Eufrasinnia, that previously existed in Germany. A Belarusian cemetery was opened in 1953, that houses also Radasłaŭ Astroŭski.

==Government==

===Local government===
South River is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by South River is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of South River is Republican Peter S. Guindi, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Borough Council are Council President John Krenzel (R, 2024; appointed to serve an unexpired term), Donna Balazs (R, 2025), Anthony Ciulla (R, 2025), John Frost (R, 2024; appointed to serve an unexpired term), Henry Dziemian (R, 2026) and James Gurchensky (R, 2026).

John Frost was appointed in May 2024 to fill the term ending December 2024 that had been held by Jason Oliveira until he resigned from office the previous month.

In January 2014, the borough council selected former councilmember Michael Trenga from among three names nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the nearly three years remaining on the vacant seat of John Trzeciak, who cited personal reasons in resigning from office just weeks after taking his seat on the council. In the November 2014 general election, Trenga was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

<text>Woodbridge Township is a township in northern Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is a regional hub of transportation and commerce for central New Jersey and a major bedroom suburb of New York City, within the New York metropolitan area. Located within the core of the Raritan Valley region, Woodbridge Township hosts the junction of the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, the two busiest highways in the state, and also serves as the headquarters for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which operates both highways.

As of the 2020 United States census, the township was the state&#x27;s seventh-most-populous municipality, with a population of 103,639, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 4,054 (+4.1%) from the 99,585 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,382 (+2.5%) from the 97,203 counted in the 2000 census. Woodbridge was the state&#x27;s sixth-largest by population in 2000 and 2010.

== History ==

According to historian Joshua Coffin, the community&#x27;s early settlers included: Captain John Pike, the ancestor of General Zebulon Montgomery Pike, who was killed at the battle of Queenstown in 1813; Thomas Bloomfield, the ancestor of Joseph Bloomfield, some years governor of New Jersey, for whom the township of Bloomfield is named; John Bishop, senior and junior; Jonathan Haynes; Henry Jaques; George March; Stephen Kent; Abraham Toppan, junior; Elisha Ilsley; Hugh March; John Bloomfield; Samuel Moore; Nathaniel Webster; John Ilsley; and others.&quot; Woodbridge was the site of the first gristmill in New Jersey. The mill was built by Jonathan Singletary Dunham, who was married to Mary Bloomfield, relative of Joseph Bloomfield.

Woodbridge Township is the oldest original township in New Jersey and was granted a royal charter on June 1, 1669, by King Charles II of England. It was reincorporated on October 31, 1693. Woodbridge Township was incorporated by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as one of the initial 104 townships incorporated in the state under the Township Act. Portions of the township were taken to form Rahway (April 19, 1858), Raritan Township (March 17, 1870, now Edison Township) and Roosevelt (April 11, 1906, now Carteret). The township is named after Reverend John W. Woodbridge (1613–1696) of Newbury, Massachusetts, who settled in the future township in 1664.

Woodbridge was the site of one of America&#x27;s deadliest rail accidents on February 6, 1951, when a crowded commuter train derailed with 85 deaths. The victims are memorialized by a pair of historical markers, installed by New Jersey Transit in 2002 and by Woodbridge Township in 2013.

In October 1982, Woodbridge made national news when, for the first time in the United States, local authorities enacted a now-repealed measure under which people were banned from using the then-popular Sony Walkman cassette players in public, while riding a bike, crossing the street, or driving a car. Violators were to be fined $50 and could have spent up to 15 days in jail. In April 2022, this law was repealed in its entirety by township ordinance.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===

, the township had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Middlesex County, by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

The Garden State Parkway extends through the Township, including exits 127 to 132. The Parkway connects Sayreville in the south to Clark in the north. In addition, the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) passes through Woodbridge Township for about , and is accessible at Exit 11 (which features a 24-lane toll gate). The Turnpike&#x27;s Grover Cleveland Service Area is located between Interchanges 11 and 12 northbound at milepost 92.9 and the Thomas Edison Service Area is between Interchanges 11 and 12 southbound at milepost 92.9.

U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 9 serve the township and merge heading north of the township as the U.S. Route 1/9 concurrency. Other roadways passing through the township are Route 27, Route 35, Route 184, and Route 440.

The 15-lane Driscoll Bridge on the Garden State Parkway and the adjacent 6-lane Edison Bridge on U.S. Route 9 both span the Raritan River, connecting Woodbridge Township on the north with Sayreville on the south.

The first cloverleaf interchange in the world, the Woodbridge Cloverleaf, opened in 1929 at the intersection of Route 25 (since renamed as U.S. Route 1/9) and Route 4 (now Route 35).

===Public transportation===

There are three train stations in the township: Metropark, Avenel, and Woodbridge. Service is provided at Metropark by NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line and at Avenel and Woodbridge on the North Jersey Coast Line. The Metropark station also offers Amtrak Northeast Corridor services to Newark (Penn Station), New York (Penn Station), Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and Boston. In September 2019, NJ Transit initiated increased daily service at the Avenel station and announced the resumption of weekend service after more than 20 years.

NJ Transit provides bus service on the 115 and 116 routes to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, on the 48 to Elizabeth and local service on the 801, 802, 803, 804, 805, 810, 813 and 815.

==Woodbridge Floodplain==

Woodbridge&#x27;s geographical features make it prone to repeated flooding. It is surrounded by water on three sides: the Arthur Kill, a tidal strait to the east, and tidal rivers to the south, Raritan River, and north, Rahway River; and, much of the developed land in Woodbridge has low elevations, as little as five feet above sea level. About 19% of Woodbridge Township lies within FEMA&#x27;s flood hazard areas. There is a long history of tidal flooding along the Woodbridge River in Woodbridge Proper, the Raritan in Keasbey and the Arthur Kill in Sewaren and Port Reading. In addition to tidal flooding, fluvial flooding is common. Woodbridge streams and rivers have been described as having a &quot;high flow, flashy nature.&quot; The land is relatively impervious, and flooding is exacerbated by steep slopes and urban cover. Flooding in the South Branch Rahway River and Pumpkin Patch Brook hazard zones is predominantly fluvial. Prolonged coastal storms (nor&#x27;easters), which combine tidal and fluvial flooding, along with flow constrictions, cause an increase in the duration of flooding of the Woodbridge River and its tributaries, Heards Brook and Wedgewood Brook, which may last for days before water levels subside. Frequency of flooding has increased over time. Sea levels are rising and residential areas have moved into previous marsh land, decreasing the ability of the land to absorb excess water. A 1770 map shows that all land surrounding the Woodbridge River was salt marshes. I

===Hurricane Sandy===

In October 2012, New Jersey was devastated by Hurricane Sandy and Woodbridge suffered significant flood damage. One of the most affected neighborhoods from Hurricane Sandy was Watson-Crampton, an area adjacent to the Woodbridge River; prior to 2009 this area was zoned for high density residential housing, including an area of wetlands and meadows. When Sandy arrived in the area, it was &quot;characterized as a tsunami-like water wall,&quot; destroying adjoining homes. After Sandy, using money from the New Jersey Buyout Program, Woodbridge began buying out and demolishing many residential properties in the flood hazard areas.

The plan is to restore the Woodbridge flood zones to their original riparian environment. Woodbridge&#x27;s actions and plans have been called a &quot;slow motion evacuation from climate change.&quot; As people move out of flood hazard areas, they will be replaced by a &quot;floodplain forest of native trees, shrubs and grass,&quot; to help absorb water from rising sea levels. Despite predictions that flooding will worsen in coming decades as a result of rising sea levels, some property owners have been unwilling to sell, in large part because government programs incentivize these homeowners not to move because the financial risk is mitigated by &quot;emergency&quot; relief in the event of a flood.

<text>Aberdeen Township is a township situated on the Jersey Shore in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is located within the Raritan Valley Region and is a part of the New York Metro Area, bordering both Old Bridge, in Middlesex County, as well as Staten Island in New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 19,329, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 1,119 (+6.1%) from the 2010 census count of 18,210, which had in turn reflected an increase of 756 (+4.3%) from the 17,454 recorded at the 2000 census.

Aberdeen Township was part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area&#x27;s economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and natural environment of the Raritan Bay coastline. The plan has since been integrated into the county&#x27;s 2016 Master Plan. Aberdeen has worked with neighboring Matawan to build transit-oriented development around the Aberdeen-Matawan train station.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Those who settled in this area developed into the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. About the year 1000, an agricultural society developed, and small villages dotted what was to become New Jersey. The Lenape began a westward retreat in the face of European settlement and disease beginning in the late seventeenth century, beginning in Monmouth County by the mid-eighteenth century. Although the Lenape presently live in Ontario and Oklahoma, their legacy survives in such names as Mohingson, Luppatatong and Matawan Creeks and Raritan Bay.

The earliest known attempt at European settlement was in 1650 when the south side of Raritan Bay was purchased from the Lenni Lenape by the New Netherland Colony.

===New Jersey===
The earliest English land grant in New Aberdeen was in 1677 when Sir George Carteret granted to Jonathan Holmes. This is in present-day Oakshades on Mohingson Creek.

Matawan Township changed its name in 1977 to Aberdeen Township, which harkened back to the name of the portion of Monmouth County referred to by Scottish settlers as &quot;New Aberdeen.&quot; New Aberdeen included the Northern portions of Monmouth County in the 1680s settled by Quakers and Presbyterians who fled Scotland to avoid religious persecution.

In 1684, Surveyor General Thomas Rudyard received a grant of on Raritan Bay and Matawan Creek, the present location of Cliffwood and Cliffwood Beach. Owing to Rudyard&#x27;s high office, this was quite controversial, and in 1685, the Board of Proprietors issued an order regarding the laying out of land. Section 7 addressed questionable activity such as Rudyard&#x27;s, and he sold his land to his son-in-law, Samuel Winder.

The 1680s saw an influx of Scottish immigrants fleeing religious persecution in response to a 1683 book by George Scott extolling the virtues of Scottish settlement in East Jersey. In 1701, a village site of was granted by the Proprietors to 24 Scottish settlers of the area. These men and six others also purchased a landing site on Matawan Creek. The village site eventually came to be called Mount Pleasant, and the landing, as it became an important shipping point for the produce of Middletown Township, became Middletown Point. A third, very scattered settlement developed in the eighteenth century west of Matawan Creek, and was called Matawan or Matavan.

===Middletown Township===
In 1693, what was to become Aberdeen Township became part of Middletown Township which, at the time, consisted of what is now Aberdeen, Holmdel Township, Hazlet Township, Middletown (including Sandy Hook), Matawan Borough, Keyport, Union Beach, Keansburg, Atlantic Highlands, Highlands and a sliver of Colts Neck Township. A portion of the township that extended as far northwest as Cheesequake Creek, was ceded to Middlesex County in 1710.

===Raritan Township===
Middletown was considered too large and unwieldy, and legislation was passed in February 1848 that took the western half of Middletown Township to create a new municipality, Raritan Township (now Hazlet Township).

===Matawan Township===
Legislation sponsored by Assemblyman Beers passed the State General Assembly and Senate, was signed by Governor of New Jersey William A. Newell, and on February 23, 1857, Matavan Township was incorporated from portions of what was then Raritan Township. This included the village of Middletown Point, Mt. Pleasant, and Matavan. The Township was named for the creek as well as the village of Matavan. The spelling of &quot;Matawan&quot; or &quot;Matavan&quot; had been interchangeable, however, when the act was published &quot;Matavan&quot; had been used, which may derive from a Lenape word meaning &quot;where two rivers come together&quot;. It may also originate from the Southern Unami &quot;Matawonge&quot;, &quot;bad riverbank&quot; or &quot;bad hill&quot;, a possible reference to bluffs along Raritan Bay which were subject to erosion and collapse prior to the construction of a seawall in the 1970s. Another possible source is &quot;Matawan&quot;, Northern Unami for &quot;bad fog&quot;, which may have referred to fog generated on Raritan Bay.

In 1865, due to postal confusion with Middletown, the Middletown Point post office was renamed &quot;Matawan&quot;, to reflect the name of the Township. This section is the present downtown area of Matawan Borough. In 1882, the spelling of the Township was officially changed to &quot;Matawan&quot;.

A small railroad station was erected along the New York and Long Branch Railroad tracks at a point called Hutchler&#x27;s Crossing in 1875. Soon known as the Cliffwood Station, it operated on Cliffwood Avenue until the station closed in 1932.

In 1885, the Cliffwood post office was established and the name of the old Matavan settlement passed into obsolescence. Matawan was formed as a borough on June 28, 1895, from portions of Matawan Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. Matawan expanded with portions of Matawan Township in 1931 and 1933.

In response to demand, a post office was established at Mount Pleasant in 1889. As that name was in use elsewhere, a new name was needed. &quot;Freneau&quot; was chosen, in honor of Philip Morin Freneau, the &quot;Poet of Revolution,&quot; and a former Mount Pleasant resident who is buried in the area. This post office has since been closed.

Cliffwood Beach, formed in the 1920s, was originally a resort community until after World War II when year-round homes were the norm. River Gardens developed in the late 1940s. Strathmore was built starting in the early 1960s by Levitt &amp; Sons, marketed as a higher-end version of the Levittown communities that the firm was known for. The 2,000 new homes in the development led to a jump in the township&#x27;s population of 10,000 over the decade, a jump of more than 140%.

===Aberdeen Township===
On November 8, 1977, the residents of Matawan Township voted to change the name of the Township to create a community identity separate from that of Matawan Borough. The residents voted to call their community Aberdeen Township. Officials believed the new name would draw attention to the Township, as it is listed first alphabetically among New Jersey&#x27;s municipalities.

Today, Aberdeen is a suburban township of containing a mix of residential, light industry and shopping centers. Sections of the township include Cliffwood, Cliffwood Beach, Freneau, Oakshades, River Gardens, Strathmore, Santa Fe Junction and Woodfield. Three postal ZIP Codes serve the township: 07721, 07735, and 07747.

The Township is served by two volunteer fire companies, the Aberdeen Township Hose and Chemical Co. No. 1, organized in 1918, and the Cliffwood Volunteer Fire Co., organized in 1927. The Aberdeen Township Hose and Chemical Co. No. 1 marked its 100th anniversary on June 10, 2018, with a celebration at Lloyd Road Park and a parade along Lloyd Road. Two volunteer First Aid Squads response to the community&#x27;s emergency medical needs; the Aberdeen Township First Aid and Rescue Squad, organized in 1954, and the South Aberdeen Emergency Medical Service, organized in 1970. A full-time Police Department was established in 1935.

The Henry Hudson Trail is a paved trail built on a former Central Railroad of New Jersey right-of-way and extending from Aberdeen east to Atlantic Highlands.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 7.77 square miles (20.13 km2), including 5.45 square miles (14.10 km2) of land and 2.33 square miles (6.03 km2) of water (29.95%).

The township is broken into two non-contiguous sections, with a small wedge-shaped exclave on the township&#x27;s southwest corner separated from the rest of the township by a portion of Matawan on the opposite side of Route 79.

Cliffwood Beach (2010 Census population of 3,194) and Strathmore (2010 population of 7,258) are unincorporated communities and census-designated places (CDPs) located within Aberdeen Township. Other unincorporated communities within Aberdeen Township include Cliffwood and Henningers Mills.

The township borders Hazlet, Holmdel, Keansburg, Keyport, Marlboro and Matawan in Monmouth County; and Old Bridge in Middlesex County. The borough has a maritime border with Staten Island in New York City.

<text>Allenhurst is a borough located on the Jersey Shore, in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The settlement was named after resident Abner Allen and was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 26, 1897, from portions of Ocean Township. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 472, a decrease of 24 (−4.8%) from the 2010 census count of 496, which in turn reflected a decline of 222 (−30.9%) from the 718 counted in the 2000 census.

Bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and Deal Lake to the west, it is in close proximity to New York City and is a stop on the NJ Transit North Jersey Coast Line. The borough is at the center of a string of wealthy communities between Long Branch and Asbury Park with many historic homes built during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In 2006, Allenhurst ranked 131st in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the most expensive ZIP Codes in the United States.

==History==
Allenhurst &quot;reflects the history of development from a rural area to a suburb and resort town of New York City. In 1895, the Allen farm was bought by the Coast Land Improvement Company in order to build an exclusive resort community to attract upper class summer residents. The proximity of Allenhurst to the rail line was significant in the growth and popularity of Allenhurst, allowing residents of New York City easier access to the community.&quot;

On April 26, 1897, Allenhurst was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of Ocean Township. The borough is situated in the center of a string of wealthy communities between Long Branch and Asbury Park. The borough was named for resident Abner Allen.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries many historic homes were built in Victorian, Queen Anne, Italian Renaissance Revival, Tudor Revival, Prairie, Mission Revival, American Craftsman, Shingle, Colonial Revival, Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architectural styles. Local ordinances overseen by an historic preservation commission have ensured the preservation of historical architecture by enforcing strict guidelines for the renovation of older homes.

In 2006, Allenhurst ranked 131st in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the most expensive ZIP Codes in the United States. In the magazine&#x27;s 2012 rankings, the borough was ranked 448th, with a median price of $665,043.

After Hurricane Sandy had devastated the shoreline in October 2012, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 2015 pumped sand onto the beaches, which contained unexploded ordnance in the form of hundreds of fusing components for World War I-era artillery. From December 2016 until March 2017, USACE Baltimore District specialists in munitions and explosives removed 362 chap-stick-sized potentially live pieces, mostly boosters, which had most likely been disposed of as excess after World War I, and are not uncommon at Gateway&#x27;s Sandy Hook Unit. &quot;Not only was Fort Hancock an active military base until 1974, but also the proving ground of the U.S. Army from 1874 until 1919.&quot;

<text>Allentown is a borough located in western Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, bordering adjacent Mercer County. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 1,734, a decrease of 94 (−5.1%) from the 2010 census count of 1,828, which in turn reflected a decline of 54 (−2.9%) from the 1,882 counted in the 2000 census. The borough is nestled within central New Jersey, and is roughly equidistant between New York City and Philadelphia.

==History==
Allentown was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on January 29, 1889, from portions of Upper Freehold Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The borough was named for settler Robert Burnet&#x27;s son-in-law, Nathan Allen or for William Allen, who served as Chief Justice of the Province of Pennsylvania.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.62 square miles (1.61 km2), including 0.60 square miles (1.54 km2) of land and 0.03 square miles (0.06 km2) of water (4.03%).

Allentown borders the municipalities of Upper Freehold Township in Monmouth County and Robbinsville Township in Mercer County.

==Economy==

Allentown&#x27;s shopping district has antique and specialty shops, as well as restaurants. Many historic homes and historic buildings are located in the borough. The Horse Park of New Jersey is a park located near the borough but does have an Allentown mailing address. Heritage Park is located within the borough near the shopping district.

The borough received the &#x27;Village Center&#x27; designation in 2002, which will allow the borough to receive additional state aid aimed at preserving historic and natural resource sites that are at risk.

For larger scaled shopping, Freehold Raceway Mall in nearby Freehold, Quaker Bridge Mall in nearby Lawrence, and Princeton Market Fair in nearby Princeton, are a short distance away.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 1,828 people, 704 households, and 499 families in the borough. The population density was 3,023.9 per square mile (1,167.5/km2).

<doc id="125458" wikidata="Q201127" url="?curid=125458" title="Asbury Park, New Jersey">
<text>Asbury Park () is a beachfront city located on the Jersey Shore in Monmouth County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 15,188, a decrease of 928 (−5.8%) from the 2010 census count of 16,116, which in turn reflected a decline of 814 (−4.8%) from the 16,930 counted in the 2000 census.

In 2022, Asbury Park&#x27;s beach was named one of the best in the world by &quot;Money&quot; and one of the best in the country by &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot;.

Asbury Park was originally incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 26, 1874, from portions of Ocean Township. The borough was reincorporated on February 28, 1893. Asbury Park was incorporated as a city, its current type of government, as of March 25, 1897.

==History==
===Early years===

A seaside community, Asbury Park is located on New Jersey&#x27;s central coast. Developed in 1871 as a residential resort by New York brush manufacturer James A. Bradley, the city was named for Francis Asbury, the first American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States. The founding of Ocean Grove in 1869, a Methodist camp meeting to the south, encouraged the development of Asbury Park and led to its being a &quot;dry town.&quot;

Bradley was active in the development of much of the city&#x27;s infrastructure, and despite his preference for gas light, he allowed the Atlantic Coast Electric Company (precursor to today&#x27;s Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co.) to offer electric service. Along the waterfront, Bradley installed the Asbury Park Boardwalk, an orchestra pavilion, public changing rooms, and a pier at the south end of that boardwalk. Such success attracted other businessmen. In 1888, Ernest Schnitzler built the Palace Merry-Go-Round on the southwest corner of Lake Avenue and Kingsley Street, the cornerstone of what would become the Palace Amusements complex; other attractions followed. During these early decades in Asbury Park, a number of grand hotels were built, including the Plaza Hotel.

Uriah White, an Asbury Park pioneer, installed the first artesian well water system. As many as 600,000 people a year vacationed in Asbury Park during the summer season in the early years, riding the New York and Long Branch Railroad from New York City and Philadelphia to enjoy the mile-and-a-quarter stretch of oceanfront Asbury Park. By 1912, &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated that the summer population could reach 200,000.

The &quot;country by the sea&quot; destination experienced several key periods of popularity. The first notable era was the 1890s, marked by a housing growth, examples of which can still be found today in a full range of Victorian architecture. Coinciding with the nationwide trend in retail shopping, Asbury Park&#x27;s downtown flourished during this period and well into the 20th century.

===1920s and modern development===


====1920s====
In the 1920s, Paramount Theatre and Convention Hall complex, the Casino Arena and Carousel House, and two handsome red-brick pavilions were built in the Asbury Boardwalk area. Beaux Arts architect Warren Whitney of New York was the designer. He had also been hired to design the Berkeley-Carteret Hotel located diagonally across from the theater and hall. At the same time, Asbury Park constructed a state-of-the-art high school overlooking Deal Lake.

====1930s====
On September 8, 1934, the wreck of the ocean liner SS &quot;Morro Castle&quot;, which caught fire and burned, beached itself near the city just yards away from the Asbury Park Convention Hall; the city capitalized on the event, turning the wreck into a tourist attraction.

In 1935, the newly founded Securities and Exchange Commission called Asbury Park&#x27;s Mayor Clarence F. Hetrick to testify about $6 million in &quot;beach improvement bonds&quot; that had gone into default. At the same time, the SEC also inquired about rental rates on the beach front and why the mayor reduced the lease of a bathhouse from $85,000 to $40,000, among many other discrepancies that could have offset debt. The interests of Asbury Park&#x27;s bond investors led Senator Frank Durand (Monmouth County) to add a last-minute &quot;Beach Commission&quot; amendment to a municipal debt bill in the New Jersey legislature. When the bill became law, it ceded control of the Asbury Park beach to Governor Harold Hoffman and a governor&#x27;s commission. The city of Asbury Park sued to restore control of the beach to the municipal council, but the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals (until 1947, the state&#x27;s highest court) upheld the validity of the law in 1937. When Durand pressed New Jersey&#x27;s legislature to extend the state&#x27;s control of Asbury Park&#x27;s beach in 1938, the lower house staged a walk out and the Senate soon adjourned, a disruption that also prevented a vote for funding New Jersey&#x27;s participation in the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. In December 1938, the court returned control of the beach to the municipal council under the proviso that a bond repayment agreement was created; Asbury Park was the only beach in New Jersey affected by the Beach Commission law. Extensive and lush floral plantings were present in Asbury Park&#x27;s Bradley Park during the 1930s, as can be seen in archival footage.

====1940s====
In 1943, the New York Yankees held their spring training in Asbury Park instead of Florida. This was because rail transport had to be conserved during the war, and Major League Baseball&#x27;s spring training was limited to an area east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River.

With the opening of the Garden State Parkway in 1947, Asbury Park saw the travel market change as fewer vacationers took trains to the seashore. While the Asbury Park exit on the Parkway opened in 1956 and provided a means for drivers to reach Asbury Park more easily, additional exits further south allowed drivers access to new alternative vacation destinations, particularly on Long Beach Island.

====1950s and beyond====
In the decades that followed the war, surrounding farm communities gave way to tracts of suburban houses, encouraging the city&#x27;s middle-class blacks as well as whites to move into newer houses with spacious yards.

With the above-mentioned change in the travel market, prompted by the opening of the Garden State Parkway in 1947 and the opening of Monmouth Mall away in Eatontown in 1960, Asbury Park&#x27;s downtown became less of an attraction to shoppers. Office parks built outside the city resulted in the relocation of accountants, dentists, doctors, lawyers, and other professionals. Moreover, the opening of Great Adventure (on July 1, 1974), a combination theme park and drive-through safari located on a lake in Jackson Township—and close to a New Jersey Turnpike exit—proved to be stiff competition for a mile-long stretch of aging boardwalk amusements.

Riots that broke out in the city on July 4, 1970, resulted in the destruction of aging buildings along Springwood Avenue, one of three main east–west corridors into Asbury Park and the central shopping and entertainment district for those living in the city&#x27;s southwest quadrant. Many of those city blocks have yet to be redeveloped into the 21st century.

Although it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, Palace Amusements was closed in 1988 and was demolished in 2004 despite attempts to save it. The complex had featured the famous face of Tillie, a symbol of the Jersey Shore.

In 1990, the carousel at the Casino Pier was sold to Family Kingdom Amusement Park in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where it continues to operate.

===21st century===
From 2002 onward, the rest of Asbury Park has been in the midst of a cultural, political, and economic revival, including a burgeoning industry of local and national artists. Its dilapidated downtown district is undergoing revitalization while most of the nearly empty blocks that overlook the beach and boardwalk are slated for massive reconstruction. In 2005, the Casino&#x27;s walkway reopened, as did many of the boardwalk pavilions. In 2007, the eastern portion of the Casino building was demolished. There are plans to rebuild this portion to look much like the original; however, the interior will be dramatically different and may include a public market (as opposed to previously being an arena and skating rink). By 2020, the Casino building still remained unrestored and had no permanent use, although it had been used to host temporary art installations.

There has also been more of a resurgence of the downtown as well as the boardwalk, with the grand reopening of the historic Steinbach department store building, as well as the rehabilitation of Convention Hall and the Fifth Avenue Pavilion (previously home to one of the last remaining Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants). The historic Berkeley-Carteret Hotel, which is to be restored to four-star resort status, was acquired in 2007; the first residents moving into the newly constructed condominiums known as North Beach, the rehabilitation of Ocean Avenue, and the opening of national businesses on Asbury Avenue.

After Hurricane Sandy, Asbury Park was one of the few communities on the Jersey Shore to reopen successfully for the 2013 summer season. Most of the boardwalk had not been badly damaged by the massive hurricane. On Memorial Day Weekend 2013, Governor Chris Christie and President Barack Obama participated in an official ceremony before a crowd of 4,000, marking the reopening of Asbury Park and other parts of the Jersey Shore. The &quot;Stronger Than The Storm&quot; motto was emphasized at this ceremony.

==Geography==

In addition to other benefits to encourage employment and investment within the UEZ, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the % rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants. Established in September 1994, the city&#x27;s Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in September 2025.

===Hotels===

At one time, there were many hotels along the beachfront. Many were demolished after years of sitting vacant, although the Sixth Avenue House Bed &amp; Breakfast Hotel (formerly Berea Manor) was recently restored after being abandoned in the 1970s—it is no longer operational and was sold as a single family home. Hotels like the Berkeley and Oceanic Inn have operated concurrently for decades, while the Empress Hotel and the former Hotel Tides were restored and reopened. The Asbury Hotel, located on 5th Avenue, was the first hotel to be &quot;built&quot; in Asbury Park in 50+ years. It stands where the old Salvation Army building once stood, which has sat vacant for over a decade. The building itself was not torn down, but the entire inside was gutted and redone. Glass paneling was added to the front and all the original outside brickwork was kept. While located a block and a half from the beach, a great view of the ocean is still offered by the upper floors and rooftop.

Currently open hotels include the Berkeley Oceanfront Hotel (formerly the Berkeley-Carteret Oceanfront Hotel), The Empress Hotel, the St. Laurent Social Club (formerly known as Hotel Tides), Asbury Park Inn, Oceanic Inn, Mikell&#x27;s Big House Bed &amp; Breakfast as well as The Asbury Hotel and The Asbury Ocean Club Hotel, both developed by iStar, the master developer for the Asbury Park Waterfront.

==Arts and culture==


===Music===
The Asbury Park music scene gained prominence in the 1960s with bands such as the Jaywalkers and many others, who combined rock and roll, rhythm and blues, soul and doo-wop to create what became known as the Sound of Asbury Park (S.O.A.P.). On December 9, 2006, founding members of S.O.A.P. reunited for the &quot;Creators of S.O.A.P.: Live, Raw, and Unplugged&quot; concert at The Stone Pony and to witness the dedication of a S.O.A.P. plaque on the boardwalk outside of Convention Hall. The original plaque included the names Johnny Shaw, Billy Ryan, Bruce Springsteen, Garry Tallent, Steve Van Zandt, Mickey Holiday, &quot;Stormin&#x27;&quot; Norman Seldin, Vini &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Lopez, Fast Eddie &quot;Doc Holiday&quot; Wohanka, Billy &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; Lucia, Clarence Clemons, Nicky Addeo, Donnie Lowell, Jim &quot;Jack Valentine&quot; Cattanach, Ken &quot;Popeye&quot; Pentifallo, Jay Pilling, John &quot;Cos&quot; Consoli, Gary &quot;A&quot; Arntz, Larry &quot;The Great&quot; Gadsby, Steve &quot;Mole&quot; Wells, Ray Dahrouge, Johnny &quot;A&quot; Arntz, David Sancious, Margaret Potter, Tom Potter, Sonny Kenn, Tom Wuorio, Rick DeSarno, Southside Johnny Lyon, Leon Trent, Buzzy Lubinsky, Danny Federici, Bill Chinnock, Patsy Siciliano, and Sam Siciliano. An additional plaque was added on August 29, 2008, honoring John Luraschi, Carl &quot;Tinker&quot; West, George Theiss, Vinnie Roslin, Mike Totaro, Lenny Welch, Steve Lusardi, and Johnny Petillo.

Musicians and bands with strong ties to Asbury Park, many of whom frequently played clubs there on their way to fame, include Fury of Five, The Gaslight Anthem, Clarence Clemons, the E Street Band, Jon Bon Jovi and Bon Jovi, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, Patti Smith, Arthur Pryor, Count Basie, The Clash, U.S. Chaos, Johnny Thunders, The Ramones, The Exploited, Charged GBH, and Gary U.S. Bonds.

In 1973 Bruce Springsteen released his debut album &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; On his follow-up album, &quot;The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle&quot;, one of the songs is entitled &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot;. Several books chronicle the early years of Springsteen&#x27;s career in Asbury Park. Daniel Wolff&#x27;s &quot;4 July Asbury Park&quot; examines the social, political and cultural history of the city with a special emphasis on the part that music played in the city&#x27;s development, culminating in Springsteen&#x27;s music. &quot;Beyond the Palace&quot; by Gary Wien is a comprehensive look at the local music scene that Springsteen emerged from, and includes many photographs of musicians and clubs. Against the backdrop of the fading resort, Alex Austin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Red Album of Asbury Park&quot; tracks a young rock musician pursuing his dream in the late 60s/early 70s, with Springsteen as a potent but as yet unknown rival.

A black-and-white multi-camera recording of Blondie in 1979, just prior to the release of their fourth album, &quot;Eat to the Beat&quot;, was taped at the Asbury Park Convention Hall on July 7, a home-state crowd for Jersey girl Debbie Harry, who was raised in Hawthorne.

===New Jersey Music Hall of Fame===
The New Jersey Music Hall of Fame was founded in Asbury Park in 2005. There have been plans to build a music museum somewhere in the city as part of the redevelopment.

===Black music and Springwood Avenue===
The West Side of Asbury Park has traditionally been home to Black music, including jazz, soul, gospel, doo wop, and R&amp;B. African American artists such as the Jersey Shore&#x27;s own Count Basie as well as Duke Ellington, Lenny Welch, the Broadways, Josephine Baker, Claude Hopkins, Bobby Thomas, Rex Stewart, Manzie Johnson, Sidney Bechet, and Clarence Clemons &quot;either played or were inspired by the [Black]-centered Springwood Avenue club circuit on the West Side of Asbury Park&quot; in the early to mid-century period at places like the Smile-A-While and Gypsy George&#x27;s.

During a visit to the West Side in 1928, Fats Waller wrote &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; with Andy Razaf at 119 Atkins Avenue in a property that still stands.

Billie Holiday, Tina Turner, Little Richard and the Four Tops all played at Cuba&#x27;s on the West Side in the mid-century period. The former home of the Turf Club, once a well-known mid-century jazz and R&amp;B joint across from what is now Springwood Park, was recently decorated with jazz-themed mural art by a team of local artists to mark its heritage. At the present-day site of Springwood Park in 1918, Black entrepreneur Reese DuPree turned Lafayette Hall (later the Roseland Hall auditorium) into a popular nightclub. The location was also used for civil rights activities; Marcus Garvey and W. E. B. Du Bois both spoke at Roseland Hall.
The Asbury Park Music Foundation, working with Lakehouse Music Academy and the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Monmouth County, founded the Hip Hop Institute to teach music and life skills education relevant to young hip hop enthusiasts.

The Asbury Park Museum hosts an exhibit on the history of music on the West Side, spanning the decades from 1880 to 1980.

The Asbury Park African-American Music Project, or AP-AMP, created a virtual West Side museum dedicated to the history of Black music in the city.

===Live music and arts venues===

With its long history as a resort town for varied social classes, Asbury Park is considered a destination for musicians, particularly a subgenre of rock and roll known as the Jersey Shore sound, which is infused with R&amp;B. As of the 2020s, it is a frequent touring stop for both burgeoning and well-known acts. It is home to venues including:
* The Stone Pony, founded in 1974, a starting point for many performers.
* Across town, on Fourth Avenue, is Asbury Lanes, a recently reopened functioning bowling alley and bar with live performances ranging from musical acts (formerly with a heavy focus on punk music), neo-Burlesque, hot rod, and art shows. The reopened venue&#x27;s latest focused has been mostly on indie rock and pop. 
* The Saint, on Main Street (formerly the Clover Club), which brings original, live music to the Jersey Shore. 
* Convention Hall holds larger events.
* The Paramount Theatre is adjacent to Convention Hall.
* The Wonder Bar
* House of Independents 
* The Asbury Park Brewery hosts small shows with a focus on punk music
* The Turf Club. &quot;Tuesday at the Turf” is a summer music series held by the Asbury Park African-American Music Project (AP-AMP) at the Turf Club site across from Springwood Park, which is the last extant structure that once contained one of Springwood&#x27;s many mid-century live Black music spots. The AP-AMP hopes to transform the space into a community venue for music and culture.
* The Empress Hotel is an LGBT resort owned by music producer Shep Pettibone that features Paradise Nightclub.
* The Baronet, a vintage movie theater which dates back to Buster Keaton&#x27;s era, was near Asbury Lanes, but its roof recently caved in and the building was demolished. The Asbury Hotel pays homage to this once great theater with its 5th floor rooftop movie theater called &quot;The Baronet&quot;. The Asbury Hotel also has an 8th floor rooftop bar, paying homage to the former building inhabitants and calling it &quot;Salvation.&quot;
* The Kingsley Theater at the Berkeley Oceanfront Hotel. The newly formed Asbury Park Theater Company (APTCo) presented Green Day’s &quot;American Idiot&quot;, the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, as the company&#x27;s debut production at this theater in 2022.
* The Upstage Club was a legendary blues, R&amp;B and rock club that was alcohol-and-drug free and is said to have influenced the Jersey Shore sound in its short run from 1968 to 1971. 
In a town that was once nearly abandoned, there are now a large number of restaurants, bars, coffee houses, two breweries, a coffee roastery, and live music venues situated in Asbury Park&#x27;s boardwalk and downtown districts.

===Festivals and events===
* Asbury Park Music Foundation is a non-profit organization that offers live music throughout the year including the free summer concert series Music Mondays in Springwood Park, AP Live and the Asbury Park Concert Band on the boardwalk. Ticketed events including Sundays on St. John&#x27;s, A Very Asbury Holiday Show! at the Paramount Theater, Sunday Sessions are held throughout the year to benefit the music foundation&#x27;s mission to provide music education programs, scholarships, instruments to the underserved youth in the community as well as supporting established and emerging local musicians with opportunities to perform.
* The Asbury Park Surf Music Festival, held on the boardwalk in August, celebrates surf music .
* The Asbury Music Awards. Formerly known as the Golden T-Bird Awards, these were established in 1993 by Scott Stamper and Pete Mantas to recognize and support significant contributions and achievements of local and regional participants in the music industry. The name of the awards was changed to the Asbury Music Awards in 1995. The award ceremony is held in November of each year, most recently at the Stone Pony.
* The Sea.Hear.Now Festival is a surfing and music festival that first appeared on the beach in Asbury Park in September 2018, as a celebration of live music, art, ocean sustainability, and surf culture. Digital pop culture magazine &quot;The Pop Break&quot; named Sea.Hear.Now the best new music festival of the year in 2018.

===Other arts and entertainment===
The Asbury Park Zombie Walk is a zombie parade along the mile-long route from Convention Hall to the intersection of Main &amp; Mattison. Held the first Saturday in October since 2008, it draws a large number of spectators and participants. Zombie-costumed participants remain in character throughout and are urged to move in a zombie-like manner. The event has grown to become one of the largest zombie walks in the world. Many do &quot;zombie versions&quot; of Halloween costumes. In 2013, the APZW achieved the world&#x27;s largest ever gathering of zombies. In 2022, the theme was punk rock.

Participants begin to gather in costume starting at 11am on the boardwalk south of Convention Hall, where makeup artists provide zombie makeovers for a fee. The APZW also has a costume contest, awarding cash and the Golden Zombie trophy. Contestants are required to be on the boardwalk by 3pm where, during the parade lead-up, judges wander the boardwalk and choose finalists for &quot;Best Young Zombie&quot;, &quot;Best Adult&quot;, &quot;Best Couple&quot; and &quot;Best Group&quot;.

At 4pm, the zombie procession begins. The zombies parade from Convention Hall down the boardwalk. Spectators line the blocked-off streets as the zombies turn west off the boardwalk at Asbury Ave and proceed down the parade route (Cookman) to end with live music at the ending street stage (on Main or on Mattison) where some spectators take photos with the zombies. At 6pm, the event ends with final judging and the Golden Zombie award ceremony.

==LGBTQ+ community==
Asbury Park has been a &quot;hub of gay life&quot; for decades. In the 1930s, Greenwich Village bohemian poet Tiny Tim (Timothy Felter), a friend of Asbury Park poet Margaret Widdemer, opened a short-lived gay-friendly tearoom on Bond Street. Since the 1950s at least, Asbury Park&#x27;s LGBT community has continued to grow. Mid-century Asbury Park gay bars like the Paddock Bar, the Blue Note, and lesbian bar Chez-L were targets of anti-gay enforcement by the state. 
In later decades, other well-known now-defunct clubs and bars oriented to gay men included Archie&#x27;s Bar, Down the Street (so named because it was located down the street from other 1970s and 1980s-era gay clubs), Odyssey, and M&amp;K. After property values plummeted locally in Asbury Park in the 1970s, gays from New York City purchased and restored Victorian homes, leading to a rejuvenation of parts of the city.

Garden State Equality, the LGBTQ+ rights organization, is headquartered on Main Street. In 2021, the LGBTQ+ community center QSpot relocated back to the west side of Asbury Park, having been established there in 2005. The center opened the QSpot Café, a gay-centered coffeehouse open on weekends only. Another notable establishment is Georgies (formerly the Fifth Avenue Tavern).

Every summer the Jersey Gay Pride parade, the state&#x27;s largest, draws hundreds of thousands of people to this LGBT destination. Project R.E.A.L. is a community organization for young LGBTQ+ socializing in Asbury Park.

The LGBTQ-centered St. Laurent Social Club on Seventh Avenue first opened as the woman-owned St. Laurent Hotel in 1885. It eventually became the iconic Jersey Shore LGBTQ mainstay Hotel Tides, and reopened again as the St. Laurent in 2022 following a sale.

Multiple restaurants in city are LGBTQ+-owned.
In 1999, Madonna producer Shep Pettibone opened Paradise, a gay discotheque near the ocean. He has since also opened the Empress Hotel, one of the state&#x27;s only gay-oriented hotels.

One subset of the LGBTQ+ community is the lesbian community of Asbury Park, a city with a tradition of lesbian bars stretching back to the 1930s. In the late 1930s, 208 Bond Street was the location of a women&#x27;s bar. In 1965, former nun Margaret &quot;Maggie the Cat&quot; Hogan opened the groundbreaking lesbian club Chez Elle (French for &quot;her house&quot;), also known as the Chez-L Lounge, and eventually joined a lawsuit that defeated efforts to discriminate against gay patrons at New Jersey nightclubs.

The Bond Street Bar was a lesbian joint in the 1970s, and the third floor of the M&amp;K nightclub, a gay disco at Monroe and Cookman Avenue, was for lesbians.
The M&amp;K was located in the large now-demolished Charms building at 401 Monroe Avenue, which was built in 1914 as an Elks club and served as a candy factory in the 1940s
 The 1980s lesbian resort, the Key West Hotel, was a large source of community for New Jersey women during that decade, as were lesbian venues like the Owl and the Pussycat, which relocated to the Key West. A Key West Hotel reunion in 2016 drew 400 people.

The Asbury Park Women&#x27;s Convention is held annually, typically during March, with a focus on women-led workshops, musical performances, comedy sets, guest speakers, spoken word and other performing arts including poetry and artwork featured in a number of female-operated businesses in the Asbury area.

The inaugural Asbury Park Dyke March was held in October 2020.

==Surfing and other sports==
Every winter, when the surf grows colder and rougher than in the summer, the city is home to the Cold War, an annual cold water surfing battle.

In 1943, the New York Yankees held spring training in Asbury Park to comply with restrictions on rail travel during World War II.

Asbury Park is the nominal home to Asbury Park FC, described as &quot;Asbury Park&#x27;s most storied sports franchise and New Jersey&#x27;s second-best football club.&quot; The project is a parody of a modern pro soccer team born out of a joke between social media professional and soccer tastemaker Shawn Francis and his friend Ian Perkins, guitarist with The Gaslight Anthem. Despite never playing games the club has an extensive merchandise line available online, including new and retro replica jerseys.

==Parks and recreation==

There are several parks and recreational activities throughout Asbury Park. Several of the parks in the city host various community events throughout the year, including many pop-up events, farmer&#x27;s markets, musical performances, etc.

The most prominent historical recreational spot is the Asbury Park Boardwalk and the beach. The boardwalk has changed a lot over the years, and today hosts various restaurants and shops, along with the 3,600 seat Asbury Park Convention Hall and 1,600 seat Paramount Theater, which are both connected via an arcade. Other activities on the boardwalk include the Silverball Retro Arcade &amp; Museum, the Asbury Splash Park, an 18 hole mini-golf, volleyball nets on the beach, a playground, and a dog park.

Bradley. These two parks host various events throughout the year, most notably the Pride Festival in June and AsburyFest in September. Past this, between Webb Street and Bond Street, is the five block long Sunset Park &amp; Lake. The lake is divided by a bridge along Grand Ave, which connects to St. John&#x27;s Island, a small island that often has community events and gatherings.

The park has been home to political and civil rights rallies.
* Soldiers Park - A triangular park locate on the corner of Grand Avenue and Cookman Avenue, centered by a memorial pedestal with a soldier on top in honor of Union soldiers who died in the Civil War, however the plaque uniquely refers to it as the &quot;War of Rebellion&quot;, a name mostly found solely in the South.
* Wesley Lake - Located along the city&#x27;s southern border between Bond Street and the boardwalk, acting as the city&#x27;s border with Ocean Grove, the lake contains footpaths surrounding the lake, as well as two footbridges, and pedal boat rentals.

==Government==

===Local government===
The City of Asbury Park is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Council-Manager form of government. The city is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. The city was previously governed under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law form of municipal government until voters approved the Council-Manager form in 2013. The government is comprised of a five-member City Council with a directly elected mayor and four council positions all elected at-large in non-partisan elections, to serve four-year terms of office on a staggered basis in elections held in even years as part of the November general election.

The form of government was chosen based on the final report issued in August 2013 by a Charter Study Commission that had narrowed its options to the weak Mayor Council-Manager form or the strong Mayor Faulkner Act form, ultimately choosing to recommend the Council-Manager form as it would retain desired aspects of the 1923 Municipal Manager Law (non-partisan voting for an at-large council with a professional manager) while allowing a directly elected mayor, elections in November and grants voters the right to use initiative and referendum. The four winning council candidates in the November 2014 general election drew straws, with two being chosen to serve full four-year terms and two serving for two years. Thereafter, two council seats will be up for election every two years.

, the mayor of Asbury Park is John Moor, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Asbury Park City Council are Deputy Mayor Amy Quinn (2028), Angela Ahbez-Anderson (2026), Eileen Chapman (2028) and Barbara &quot;Yvonne&quot; Clayton (2028).

In May 2016, the City Council appointed Eileen Chapman to fill the vacant council seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by Joe Woerner until he resigned from office.

Myra Campbell, the last mayor under the old form of government, was the first African-American woman to be chosen as mayor when she took office in July 2013.

Burke&quot;, which are now referred to as &quot;SDA Districts&quot; based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority.

Students from Allenhurst attend the district&#x27;s schools as part of a sending/receiving relationship. In July 2014, the New Jersey Department of Education approved a request by Interlaken under which it would end its sending relationship with the Asbury Park district and begin sending its students to the West Long Branch Public Schools through eighth grade and then onto Shore Regional High School. Students from Deal had attended the district&#x27;s high school as part of a sending/receiving relationship that was terminated and replaced with an agreement with Shore Regional.

Students currently attending the school would be reallocated to the district&#x27;s two other elementary schools, with those going into fifth grade assigned to attend middle school. During the summer of 2012, the school board approved funding for development plans to house the Board of Education in the vacant Barack Obama Elementary School. The school board awarded $894,000 to an architect firm to handle the renovation design and subsequent project bids. The estimated cost of the renovation was $1.6 million.

City of Asbury Park and Asbury Partners, LLC&quot;, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division affirmed a ruling in favor of eminent domain of the Board of Education building on Lake Avenue. The Board of Education moved to the third and fourth floors of 603 Mattison Avenue, the former &quot;Asbury Park Press&quot; building, where it paid $189,327 in rent per year.

In February 2007, the offices of the Asbury Park Board of Education were raided by investigators from the State Attorney General&#x27;s office, prompted by allegations of corruption and misuse of funds.

== In popular culture ==
Palace Amusements and the Tillie mural have featured in numerous works of popular culture. Additional works reference Asbury Park, specifically.

In the song &quot;At Long Last Love&quot; (1938), originally written by Cole Porter for the musical &quot;You Never Know&quot; (1938), Frank Sinatra sings &quot;Is it Granada I see, or only Asbury Park?&quot;

Bruce Springsteen named his first album &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot; in 1973 and described his early life there. The artist has also dedicated many songs to Asbury Park such as &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; and &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; on his 2002 album, &quot;The Rising&quot;.

The group mewithoutYou references Asbury Park several times on their album &quot;Ten Stories&quot; (2012). The song &quot;Bear&#x27;s Vision of St. Agnes&quot; mentions &quot;that tattered rag shop back in Asbury Park&quot;, and the song &quot;Fox&#x27;s Dream of the Log Flume&quot; mentions the pier and sand dunes.

Asbury Park was used for the location filming of the crime drama &quot;City by the Sea&quot; (2002), starring Robert De Niro, James Franco and Frances McDormand, which was nominally set in Long Beach, New York, where no filming actually took place, according to a disclaimer that was included as part of the closing credits. The film features scenes set on a shabby, dilapidated boardwalk and in a ruined/abandoned casino/arcade building. Residents of both places objected to the way their cities were depicted. Asbury Park appears at the start of the 1999 film Dogma.

The 2006 horror film &quot;Dark Ride&quot; is set in Asbury Park.

The Season 2 finale of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Funhouse&quot;, originally aired in April 2000, includes several discrete dream sequences dreamed by Tony that take place on the Asbury Park Boardwalk, including Madame Marie&#x27;s as well as Tony and Pauly playing cards at a table in the empty hall of the Convention Center. The episode&#x27;s title alludes to the Palace, which is also shown.

In a 1955 episode of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; (&quot;Better Living Though TV&quot;), Alice Kramden ridicules husband Ralph Kramden&#x27;s seemingly never-ending parade of failed get-rich-quick schemes, including his investment in &quot;the uranium field in Asbury Park&quot;.

Asbury Park is the setting of the Nickelodeon series &quot;Erin &amp; Aaron&quot;.

Routine Maintenance, a concept album and the second from the musical act Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties, features the titular character working as a painter in Asbury Park.

<doc id="125462" wikidata="Q1087555" url="?curid=125462" title="Brielle, New Jersey">
<text>Brielle is a borough located in southern Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, along the Manasquan River. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,982, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 208 (+4.4%) from the 2010 census count of 4,774, which in turn reflected a decline of 119 (−2.4%) from the 4,893 counted in the 2000 census.

Brielle was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 10, 1919, from portions of Wall Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on June 3, 1919. The borough was named after Brielle, Netherlands.

==History==
Archaeological excavations along what is now Birch Drive reveal temporary Lenape Native American settlements. The Lenape practiced farming in other parts of Monmouth County much of the year, and they visited the wooded areas in what is now Brielle for hunting and fishing.

The area was originally part of Shrewsbury Township and the first settlers were primarily farmers, and the area became known as Union Landing. In colonial times, salt was an important preservative, and before the American Revolutionary War, most of it was imported from Great Britain. The Union Salt Works opened around the outbreak of the war, and on April 5, 1778, several British Loyalists attacked and burned the salt works and other buildings. A year later, the salt works reopened and continued to operate through the duration of the war.

Early in the 19th century, Shrewsbury Township was divided, and the area became part of Howell Township which was further divided in 1851, when the area became part of Wall Township. On July 7, 1881, a group of businessmen purchased several acres of land and formed the Brielle Land Association with the intention of building vacation homes. The quaint riverside charm of the area reminded one of the developers of another pastoral town on a river which he had visited, Brielle, in the Netherlands.

Author Robert Louis Stevenson vacationed in Brielle for most of May 1888. During his stay he wrote a portion of his book &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot; and gave Osborn Island the nickname &quot;Treasure Island&quot; which was the title of one of his previous books.

Located at the southeastern corner of Monmouth County, Brielle is bordered to the north and east by the Manasquan, to the west by Brick Township (in Ocean County) and Wall Township and to the south by Point Pleasant and Point Pleasant Beach across the Manasquan River. Route 35 runs through the middle of the town and Route 70 runs along its western edge.

The borough is primarily a residential community of single homes, with a few condominiums; there are almost no undeveloped lots of land left. There are several businesses located along Union Avenue and Higgins Avenue and some marinas along the Manasquan River. &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; once stated that Brielle has &quot;16 bars and no churches&quot;. It currently has one church, &quot;The Church in Brielle&quot; (formerly the Dutch Reformed Church) and several restaurants that have liquor licenses, but no full bars. There is also a 18 hole golf course called the &quot;Manasquan River Golf Club&quot;.

The town has approximately of waterfront along the Manasquan River, Glimmerglass, and Debbie&#x27;s Creek, all of which are salt water and tidal. Brielle&#x27;s borders extend to an island in the Manasquan River.

<text>Cliffwood Beach is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Aberdeen Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,036.

==History==

Matawan Township was incorporated on February 23, 1857. This included a portion of Middletown Point (now Matawan Borough), a portion of Mt. Pleasant (renamed Freneau in 1890) and Matawan (or &quot;Matavan&quot; or Matawan Point) beach. The beach area of Matawan Township would later be renamed Cliffwood Beach.

Cliffwood Beach was purchased in 1860 by Henry Clark, who planned on creating a resort community. Although the concept initially failed, in 1923 the company of Morrisey and Walker created the concept of a resort community in Cliffwood Beach, with summer bungalows complementing the emerging resorts of the Jersey shoreline of the 1920s. The real estate sales offices of Morrisey and Walker was a local attraction in itself, being contracted in the appearance of a pirate ship, as an homage to the lore of Captain Kidd and his treasure and Treasure Lake in Cliffwood Beach.

In 1924, a one-mile boardwalk was constructed along the shoreline of Cliffwood Beach. In 1926 the Country Club Casino was built along the cliff walk, overlooking Treasure Lake. Also in 1926, the Cat &#x27;n Fiddle restaurant opened, along with a merry-go-round and an arcade. In 1928, construction began for a salt water pool adjacent to the boardwalk and Treasure Lake. Completed in 1929, it was a state attraction, frequented by Olympic medalists George Kojak and Johnny Weissmuller. Weissmuller later became famous for his role as &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

A Cliffwood Beach directional sign is seen briefly in the 1939 documentary &quot;The City&quot; (with music by Aaron Copland). An unending traffic jam getting to the beach is used in the film as an endemic problem of unplanned growth.

Cliffwood Beach was a popular resort until the 1950s, with a boardwalk, saltwater swimming pool, dining and dancing at the Cat &#x27;n Fiddle, and other amusements. The beachfront facilities were destroyed by a series of hurricanes in 1954: Carol (August 30), Edna (September 11) and Hazel (October 15). In 1955, Hurricane Diane destroyed all that had remained of Cliffwood Beach&#x27;s amusements, with the exception of the saltwater pool, which survived the storms but was later filled in.

Cliffwood Beach was an early recipient of aid through the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection&#x27;s Green Acres Program, which was established in 1961. The township received funds to build a park near the Cliffwood Beach waterfront. The tennis courts have since been converted to an enclosed in-line skating arena, and the original playground equipment and two basketball courts have been upgraded.

The community was featured in &quot;Weird NJ&quot; magazine&#x27;s Issue #28. The article, &quot;Cliffwood Beach: A Forgotten Resort&quot;, recounted the abrupt manner in which the town was forgotten.

Nothing remains of any of the boardwalk amusements except for the large swimming pool, which lies abandoned and filled with debris.

On August 8, 2017, the Aberdeen Township opened the beachfront Veterans Park, which includes a pirate-ship themed spray park for all ages; two pirate-themed playgrounds, one for kids ages 2-5 and the other 5–12; a picnic grove with shade, a multi-purpose field for Little League baseball, softball, and soccer; a kayak and small watercraft launch; a gazebo/band shell; a flagpole and war veterans&#x27; memorial monument; and a restroom/equipment/storage building.

On July 19, 2018, the township completed and opened the Aberdeen Sea Walk, a half-mile trail that primarily runs along the original damaged seawall. It features nine fishing outcrops, 15 outlooks, several benches, and a gazebo. There are 38 LED pathway lights as well as several security cameras to prevent vandalism. A five-foot teak boardwalk outlet path was added by the gazebo to the beach. The project fully connected Beach Drive and Lakeshore Drive, creating the first fully connected recreational infrastructure for the first time in decades.

==Geography==

Cliffwood Beach is in northern Monmouth County, in the northernmost part of Aberdeen Township. It lies north of Route 35 and is bounded by Keyport on the east and Laurence Harbor in Middlesex County on the west. The community faces Raritan Bay, including a portion of Keyport Harbor, and Matawan Creek separates Cliffwood Beach from Keyport. To the west, the beach continues as Raritan Bay Beach and Seidler Beach into Old Bridge Township in Middlesex County. The counties are separated by Whale Creek, which is spanned near the bayfront by a concrete bridge.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Cliffwood Beach CDP has a total area of , including of land and of water (5.72%).

Cliffwood Beach is the home of Gaudalcanal Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post Number 4745, which is used as a community hall, rental facility, and polling place for elections. Adjacent to the VFW post is Veterans of Foreign Wars Park (VFW Park), which contains Alvin Ross Memorial Field. The field, which has two softball diamonds, backstops, team benches and bleachers, is used for local children&#x27;s and adults&#x27; softball and soccer leagues scheduled by the Aberdeen Township Department of Parks and Recreation. The Aberdeen Township Public Service Facility on Lenox Road is the maintenance and recycling facility for the township.

==Education==
Cliffwood Beach, as a part of Aberdeen Township, is served by the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District.

<text>Colts Neck Township is a township in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located in the New York Metropolitan Area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 9,957, a decrease of 185 (−1.8%) from the 2010 census count of 10,142, which in turn reflected a decline of 2,189 (−17.8%) from the 12,331 counted in the 2000 census.

The municipality of Colts Neck Township was initially established by an act of the New Jersey Legislature as Atlantic Township on February 18, 1847, carved from portions of Freehold Township, Middletown Township, and Shrewsbury Township. The name was changed to &quot;Colts Neck Township&quot; as of November 6, 1962, based on the results of a referendum held that day.

The township has been ranked as one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Colts Neck residents had a median household income of $167,480, ranked fifth in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

== Community ==

Colts Neck is a wealthy bedroom community in Central New Jersey, located within the New York metropolitan area. Many people choose to move to Colts Neck due to its open space and proximity to the Jersey Shore, while still being within commuting distance of New York City. The township&#x27;s strict zoning ordinances have long kept out urban development and chain stores, allowing for locally owned businesses, while still being close to malls, movie theaters, and other amenities in neighboring communities.

The township has a Farmland Preservation Committee which to date has preserved nearly of land, providing one way in which Colts Neck has been able to prevent large-scale development. The township has strict zoning regulations, and because there is no public water or sewage service, most homes must be built on lots covering a minimum of 2, 5 and .

Originally a farming community, Colts Neck has long been known for its large number of equestrian farms. From the 1950s into the 1970s many of Colts Neck&#x27;s heavily wooded areas were developed with large colonial and ranch-style houses on acre-sized lots. In the 1980s and continuing into the 2000s much of the town&#x27;s farm land has been replaced with large houses, mansions and sprawling estates, although a large number of equestrian farms remain. During this time period increasing home prices in northern New Jersey and New York City resulted in large numbers of people moving to central New Jersey, causing real estate prices in Colts Neck and surrounding towns to rise considerably over the course of the two decades. Colts Neck real estate prices remain high despite the economic downturn: as of November 2012, the average listing price of a house was $1,433,112 and the number of home sales is down 41.4% from the previous year.

Many of Colts Neck&#x27;s residents are professional business people who commute into New York City&#x27;s financial district, as could be seen in the unusual proportion of the small community who were lost in the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. A memorial garden dedicated to the five members of the community who were lost was created at the municipal center by sculptor Jim Gary, a member of the community who was raised in Colts Neck. The central feature of the memorial garden is his sculpture of metal and stained glass.

In 2018, Colts Neck made national headlines when a man set his brother&#x27;s mansion on fire, killing his brother, sister in law and their two children.

== Economy ==

Laird &amp; Company produces Laird&#x27;s Applejack at its facility in the Scobeyville section of the township. Since the end of distilling in Colts Neck in 1972, the company has had its apples picked and distilled in Virginia, and then brought north to be aged, blended and bottled at its facility in the township. The only remaining producer of Applejack in the United States, the company received the first license granted by the United States Department of the Treasury, which was granted in 1780.

<text>Englishtown is a rapidly growing borough in western Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The community is located within the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 2,346, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 499 (+27.0%) from the 2010 census count of 1,847, which in turn reflected an increase of 83 (+4.7%) from the 1,764 counted in the 2000 census.

Englishtown was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on January 4, 1888, from portions of Manalapan Township, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day. The borough was named for James English, an early settler.

==History==

At the Battle of Monmouth, an American Revolutionary War battle fought on June 28, 1778, in Monmouth County, American General Charles Lee led the advance and initiated the first attack on the column&#x27;s rear. When the British turned to flank him, he ordered a general retreat without as much as firing a shot at the enemy, and his soldiers soon became disorganized. General George Washington continued the battle, earning respect for the Continental Army troops under his command. In the dining room of the Village Inn, located in the center of Englishtown, General Washington and Lord Stirling drew up the court martial papers citing Lee for his conduct during and after the battle.

==Government==

===Local government===
Englishtown is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Englishtown is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of the Borough of Englishtown is Republican Daniel Francisco, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Borough Council are Kyle Jewusiak (R, 2027), Meaghan Lewis (R, 2025), William L. Lewis Jr. (R, 2027), Alexi Reque (R, 2025; elected to serve an unexpired term), William Sabin Sr. (R, 2026) and Louis E. Sarti Jr. (R, 2026).

In January 2024, Alexi Reque was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2025 that became vacant following the resignation of Wayne Krawiec earlier that month. Reque served in an interim basis until the November 2024 general election, when he was chosen to serve the balance of the term of office.

In March 2020, Daniel Francisco was chosen to fill the seat expiring in December 2021 that had been held by Lori Cooke until her seat was declared to be vacant after she had missed three consecutive unexcused absences from council meetings.

In April 2016, the borough council selected Eric Mann from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring December 2017 that had been held by Rudy Rucker until his resignation; Mann served on an interim basis until the November 2016 general election, when he was elected to fill the balance of the term.

On March 28, 2012, Jayne Carr&#x27;s seat on the borough council was officially vacated in accordance with state law after she failed to appear at eight consecutive meetings of the borough council dating back to December 2011. Carr claimed that she had stayed away from council meetings after receiving a death threat, and had informed the Monmouth County Prosecutor regarding the incident. As of May 4, 2012, no official statement has ever been made from any law enforcement agency at the local, state, or federal level confirming Carr&#x27;s claims. In November 2011, Carr had been censured &quot;for conduct detrimental to the orderly conduct of borough governance and violating standards of decorum and debate of a public body&quot;, based on statements that she had made accusing a council member and borough employee of breaking state law, and of having claimed to have chaired meetings of the Englishtown Development Committee.

<text>Fair Haven is a borough situated in the Jersey Shore region within Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, in the New York metropolitan area. Fair Haven is located on the Rumson peninsula along the Navesink River and is bordered by Red Bank and Little Silver to the west. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 6,269, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 148 (+2.4%) from the 2010 census count of 6,121, which in turn reflected an increase of 184 (+3.1%) from the 5,937 counted in the 2000 census.

Fair Haven was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 28, 1912, from portions of Shrewsbury Township, subject to the results of a referendum held on April 23, 1912. Portions of the borough were exchanged with Red Bank on June 17, 1957.

The borough has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. In the 2013–2017 American Community Survey, Fair Haven had a median household income of $158,264 (ranked 23rd in the state) and included 36.6% of households earning more than $200,000 annually.

In 2018, &quot;New Jersey Business Magazine&quot; listed Fair Haven as 25th in its listing of &quot;The Most Expensive ZIP Codes in New Jersey&quot;, with a median sale price 2017 of $745,000

==History==
Fair Haven&#x27;s first permanent settlement dates to a structure built in 1816 at the Navesink River near today&#x27;s Fair Haven Road. By the mid-19th century, steamboats stopped at &quot;Chandler&#x27;s Dock&quot; on a route between Red Bank and New York City, bringing visitors to the area and local oysters to the city. Fisk Chapel was rebuilt in 1882 to accommodate the borough&#x27;s African American population.

The steamship &quot;Albertina&quot; is depicted on the Borough seal. It was built in 1882 by Lawrence &amp; Foulks.

Fair Haven has an annual Fireman&#x27;s Fair during the last weekend of summer including Labor Day weekend which attracts a couple of thousand people, including noted musicians Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi. The Fair Haven Fireman&#x27;s Fair also has a Fireman&#x27;s night and invites all firefighters from any other firehouse to come and join in the festivities. The Fireman&#x27;s Fair used to raffle off a car each year, but most attendees already had their own cars and the decision was made in the 1990s to switch to a 50/50 raffle whose prize can be in the tens of thousands of dollars. The fair is on the Fire Company grounds.

Fair Haven is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Fair Haven is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of the Borough of Fair Haven is Republican Joshua Halpern, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2026. Members of the Fair Haven Borough Council are Council President Elizabeth M. &quot;Betsy&quot; Koch (R, 2027), Tracey Cole (R, 2027), Michal DiMiceli (D, 2026), Kristen Hoey (R, 2025), Andrew &quot;Drew&quot; LaBarbera (R, 2025) and Brian Olson (R, 2026).

Benjamin Lucarelli was chosen as mayor in February 2012 to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mike Halfacre, and who left office to take a position in the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, with Eric R. Jaeger in turn chosen in March 2012 to fill Lucarelli&#x27;s vacancy on the borough council.

The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Farmingdale is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie.

<doc id="125470" wikidata="Q691237" url="?curid=125470" title="Freehold Borough, New Jersey">
<text>Freehold is a borough in and the county seat of Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Known for its Victorian era homes and extensive colonial history, the borough is located in the Raritan Valley region within the New York metropolitan area, located about from Manhattan and from Staten Island. The borough has grown to become a commuter town of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 12,538, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 486 (+4.0%) from the 12,052 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,076 (+9.8%) from the 10,976 counted in the 2000 census.

The Freeholds region, which includes the borough and Freehold Township (which completely surrounds the borough), is a commercial hub for central New Jersey. The borough is located relatively close to the Raritan Bayshore communities to the north, including The Amboys, Old Bridge, Matawan, Keyport, Keansburg, and Middletown, along with being relatively close to the Tri-City region of Jersey Shore municipalities (and their vicinities) to the east, including Red Bank, Long Branch, and Asbury Park.

What is now Freehold Borough was originally incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 25, 1869, from portions within Freehold Township. The town became independent of the township in 1888. On April 15, 1919, Freehold was incorporated as a borough, including all of Freehold and additional portions of Freehold Township, based on the results of a referendum held on July 8, 1919. Additional portions of Freehold Township were annexed on September 7, 1926.

The Hispanic and Latino population has been rapidly growing in Freehold Borough for the last 40 years. The Hispanic population making up 4.6% (0.2% Mexican) in the 1980 Census, 11.3% (2.8% Mexican) in the 1990 Census, 28.0% (17.3% Mexican) in 2000, 42.9% (29.6% Mexican) in 2010, and recently in 2020, a majority at 53.0% Hispanic. Meanwhile, the Black or African American population has decreased in recent decades: 17.1% in 1970, 19.8% in 1980, 18.2% in 1990, 15.8% in 2000, 12.6% in 2010 and 9.4% in 2020.

In 2021, Freehold Borough became one of few towns in the state (including, Bellmawr, Egg Harbor Township, Montclair and Woodbridge Township) that has authorized the sale of cannabis through authorized dispensaries and for the allowance of cultivators, distributors, wholesalers, and manufacturers.

==History==
===Early history===
The Lenni Lenape Native Americans were the earliest known people to live in the area that became Freehold. The Lenape were a hunter-gatherer society. They were largely sedentary, changing campsites seasonally. They were prolific hunters of small game and birds. They were also skilled fisherman, and were known to harvest vast amounts of clams from the bays and inlets on the Jersey Shore. They also practiced some agriculture to augment their food supply. During this time, an important crossroad of two major Lenape trails was located in the area of Freehold.

By the late 17th century, the English had begun to take over the area. In 1664, the Duke of York (later James II &amp; VII) granted a patent to Sir George Carteret to develop the area. In 1685, Scottish Presbyterians from Scotland, along with English Baptists and Quakers from New England fleeing religious persecution at home, became the first to settle within the area. In 1693, along with Middletown and Shrewsbury, Freehold was established by act of legislature as one of the three original townships in Monmouth County. The name of the borough comes from the word &quot;Freehold&quot;, an English legal term describing fee simple property ownership.

===Colonial Freehold===

In 1714, when the colonial government was deciding where to locate the county seat and courthouse, Freeholder John Reid, the first Surveyor General of East Jersey, wanted the county seat located in Freehold Township. Reid sold land suitable for use as a courthouse to the Board of Chosen Freeholders at a bargain price, and this may have been the deciding factor why Freehold was selected over Middletown and Shrewsbury. In return for the heavily discounted price, Reid placed a restrictive covenant in the deed that, should the property ever cease being used as a courthouse, ownership would revert to the Reid family. Direct descendants of John Reid still reside in Freehold Township.

Freehold was officially designated as the seat of the Monmouth County government, and a court house was commissioned to be built on the land purchased from John Reid. The Monmouth Courthouse opened in 1715. A small village quickly began to develop around the courthouse. At first, the village was called Monmouth Courthouse. Over time, other government buildings opened near the courthouse, including a sheriff&#x27;s office, a prison and a post office. A number of homes and commercial businesses also sprang up in the village, including a blacksmith, a general store, a bank, a hotel, and saloon. 
In the area surrounding Monmouth Courthouse, many successful farms began to appear. The farms in Freehold were particularly well known for the production of potatoes, beans, and rye, which were sold in the markets of nearby cities. Freehold also became known for its excellent horse farms. The differences within Freehold between growing village around the courthouse and the surrounding farmland were the seeds for the eventual division of Freehold into two separate municipalities in the early 20th century.

As of 1745, the majority of families in Freehold were still Scottish immigrants. In modern Freehold today, many important streets bear the name of early colonial families, including Barkalow, Applegate, Rhea, Throckmorton, and Schanck.

===Revolutionary War===
Freehold was deeply impacted by the American Revolution. By the early 1770s, the Sons of Liberty were actively recruiting local members in Freehold, and were agitating the relationship between the British government and the colonists. In 1775, immediately after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Capt. Elias Longstreet recruited the first company of Freeholders to join the Continental Army. Freehold was a known center of patriot activity. The Declaration of Independence was publicly proclaimed, read aloud, from the steps of the Freehold Courthouse just a few days after being signed in Philadelphia.

However, after British success at the Battle of Long Island, Freehold and all of Monmouth County fell under the control of Loyalists. The British government continued to operate the Freehold Courthouse, and several people involved in revolutionary activism were arrested and tried for treason at the courthouse. The success of the Continental Army at the Battle of Trenton helped to weaken loyalist control of Freehold.

In June 1778, the British Army began a major strategic evacuation of Philadelphia. They attempted to protect a long, slow moving column of loyalist families, equipment, and other supplies seized in Philadelphia, as they moved towards ships in New York Harbor. On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army intercepted the column in Freehold (the area is now part of Freehold &amp; Manalapan Townships). The Battle of Monmouth was one of the largest battles of the Revolutionary War, involving over 25,000 soldiers combined in Continental, British, and Hessian forces. The initial engagement was in doubt until Washington arrived because Charles Lee was retreating from the battlefield. Washington rallied the Continentals and strongly engaged the British forces and they held their ground on the battlefield. However, the British forces were successful in completing their primary goal, the evacuation of Philadelphia. Both sides claimed victory in the battle.

Several notable figures during the Revolutionary War fought at the Battle of Monmouth. British forces were commanded by Sir Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis. The Continental Army was commanded by George Washington and Charles Lee. Charles Lee was court martialed by the Continental Army for his behavior at the Battle of Monmouth. Nathaniel Greene, Alexander Hamilton, the Marquis de Lafayette and Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben also fought for the Continental Army at the Battle of Monmouth. Another famous figure at the Battle of Monmouth was Molly Pitcher, who manned a cannon during the battle after her husband was wounded.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Monmouth, Loyalist control of Freehold faltered. The town ceased to have a functioning municipal government, and the courthouse was closed until the end of the war. Minor clashes between loyalists and continentals flared up in town, with the violence peaking around 1780. Colonel Tye, an escaped slave and leader of a prominent loyalist guerilla force, conducted several raids in and around Freehold. One famous incident was the capture and hanging of Joshua Huddy by British Loyalists under the direction of Richard Lippincott. Colonel Tye was killed during the raid on Huddy&#x27;s home. Patriots later cut down Huddy&#x27;s body hanging from the gallows and buried it in Freehold, at Old Tennent Church. At the end of the war, the community was deeply divided, and nearly 120 loyalist families left Freehold, fearing persecution from their neighbors. Most of these families re-settled in Canada.

===19th century===

During the early 19th century, Freehold steadily grew in size. The village around the courthouse was now called Freehold, along with the surrounding farmland. In 1852, when long distance railroad systems were first being developed, a railroad station, with trains making regular stops, running along what is now known as Throckmorton Street, about one block from the courthouse. Freehold soon had public sewers in the village and in some of the outlying farmland. By 1883, there was an electrical grid and a telephone switchboard, at a time when these inventions were still brand new. These public advancements caused rapid economic growth in Freehold. The village of Freehold became an important commercial and industrial hub in central New Jersey. The farms in the rest of Freehold benefitted greatly by being able to sell their products more easily in New York and Philadelphia. Both the village and the farms prospered together, however the public policies sought by the two different communities continued to grow further apart. The municipal government was increasingly divided between the villagers and farmers.

In 1824, the American Hotel opened on Main Street in Freehold; It is still standing today, and is one of the oldest buildings in Freehold. In 1853, the Freehold Raceway opened. Though the original grandstand burned down in a fire, the racetrack is still open today, and is one of the oldest harness racetracks in America. The Great Fire of Freehold happened on October 30, 1873. The fire reportedly began in a commercial building on Main Street. It soon spread to engulf a large section of the village, and many wooden buildings, including Monmouth Courthouse, were burned down.

Freehold also has an important place in the history of the bicycle. Cycling champion Arthur Augustus Zimmerman resided in the borough during his racing career in the 1880s and 1890s, and from 1896 to 1899 operated the Zimmerman Bicycle Co.; the company&#x27;s bicycles were known as the &quot;Zimmy.&quot; Today, Freehold Borough is home to the Metz Bicycle Museum, where the only extant &quot;Zimmy&quot; can be seen.

===Freehold divided===

At the beginning of the 20th century, Freehold was an increasingly divided community. The issue of local tax dollars, used as funding for public works and infrastructure projects, was the primary point of contention. The Freeholders living in the downtown area, around the courthouse had very different ideas about how to spend public money compared to the Freeholders living in the surrounding farmland. Tension within the community increased greatly in 1916 when a severe polio epidemic swept through Freehold.

After contentious public debate, a referendum was held to on the future of Freehold, and voters overwhelmingly decided to split the town into two separate municipalities.

On April 15, 1919, Freehold Borough formally separated from Freehold Township. Freehold residents generally refer to the different municipalities simply as the Borough and the Township. The borough, the downtown area around the courthouse, retained all the existing government buildings around Court Street and Main Street. The borough also kept the designation as county seat. Freehold Township, the farming communities that surrounded the courthouse, set up a new city hall complex on Schanck Road. The township completely encircles the borough. On September 7, 1926, Freehold Borough annexed additional territory from the township.

===The Borough in the 20th century===

Freehold Borough initially prospered in the early 20th century. However, by mid-century, the Borough began to decline as downtown areas across the country shrank, and suburban areas began growing. In 1961, the A &amp; M Karagheusian rug factory closed. This factory had long been the largest employer in the area, and its closure had a devastating effect on the economic stability of the borough. The borough managed to turn around its economic decline by establishing the downtown area as a center for restaurants and nightlife. Several well-known local restaurants on Main Street are now crowded every night of the week.

Freehold Borough was an important center of African American civil rights activity in New Jersey during the years leading up to the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision in 1954. In 2007, Jaye Sims became the first African American official to be elected to office.

Bruce Springsteen grew up in the borough. His family lived in various homes on Randolph St, Institute St and finally South St. In 1963, he graduated eighth grade from St. Rose of Lima School, and graduated from Freehold Borough High School in 1967. In 1973, he released his first album, and rocketed to international fame. Springsteen has always remained loyal to Freehold and makes reference to it in several of his famous songs, including &quot;My Hometown&quot;. In 1996, he conducted a small benefit concert in Freehold for St. Rose of Lima.

==Economy==
Suburbanization within the vicinity of the Freeholds region has been due to its convenient location near the Jersey Shore, and proximity to cities such as New York, Newark, Trenton, and Philadelphia. The region has, thus, been a longtime premier shopping destination in Central New Jersey.

===Commerce===
====Main Street====

The borough is home to Downtown Freehold, located on East and West Main Street (County Route 537). This downtown section has various eateries, bars, boutiques, historical sites, and other excursions. Within this section of town, there have been plans to revitalize the downtown area, as outlined in the Freehold Center Core Revitalization Plan (2008), in which NJ Transit has sponsored a project in transforming the Freehold Center Bus Station into a Transit Village. This new designation would foster in the creation of a transit-oriented development zoning district around the bus station.

====Freehold Raceway====
Established in 1853, making it the nation&#x27;s oldest half-mile harness racing track, Freehold Raceway offers horse lovers and bettors an opportunity to see harness racing. The raceway announced in September 2024 that they will close, with the final racing date being December 28.

====Freehold Raceway Mall====

Completed in August 1990, the Freehold Raceway Mall is a super-regional mall located in neighboring Freehold Township. The mall was constructed at a cost of $125 million on a site covering more than across from the Freehold Raceway over U.S. 9, and it has a gross leasable area of .

====Cannabis businesses====
In 2021, the Freehold Borough council approved an ordinance to opt-in for cannabis businesses to operate within the borough. In a 4–1 vote, the ordinance established the parameters and zoning regulations to where cannabis businesses could operate, including commercial manufacturing and limited professional office zoning categories. This would make Freehold one of the few municipalities in the state (including, Bellmawr, Egg Harbor Township, Montclair, and Woodbridge Township) that has authorized the sale of cannabis in New Jersey, especially within the greater central New Jersey region. NJ Leaf, a medical cannabis dispensary located on Park Avenue, opened in March 2023 and is expected to also expand to recreational sales in the near future.

===Manufacturing===

Freehold Borough and Township began to grow in commercial and industrial manufacturing of goods during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

====A and M Karagheusian Mill====

A &amp; M Karagheusian, Inc. was a rug manufacturer headquartered at 295 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.

There was another factory in Roselle Park, New Jersey, that operated from May 19, 1923, to 1962.

Bruce Springsteen wrote about the Karagheusian Rug Mill’s closing in his 1984 song &quot;My Hometown&quot;.

====Brockway Glass====
Brockway Glass Company built a facility on Center Street in 1955. Brockway Glass then proceeded to build additional facilities in the region in 1956, 1967, 1969 and 1976.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Roads and highways====

, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Monmouth County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

U.S. Route 9, Route 33 Business, Route 79, County Route 522 and County Route 537 all pass through Freehold Borough.

=====Freehold Circle=====

Freehold Circle was located near the western boundary of Freehold Borough near Freehold Raceway. The circle carried traffic between U.S. Route 9, Route 33 Business and Manalapan Avenue (CR 24); it was eliminated in the 1980s due to the increased traffic load caused by a boom in commercial and residential development. Most notable of the commercial development is the Freehold Raceway Mall, in Freehold Township just south of the old circle on US 9, whose development in the late 1980s was a major impetus to redesign the circle. The former circle now features several jughandles, and most Manalapan Avenue traffic must use a connector road to Business Route 33 to reach the main intersection, but it is still known by locals as Freehold Circle. In the early 1940s, the Freehold Circle was the planned terminus of highway that would funnel traffic from South Amboy to the Jersey Shore by way of Matawan and Marlboro Township.

====Public transportation====
=====Rail=====
In the 19th and 20th centuries, Freehold Borough and Freehold Township had two major railways. One major railway in the area was the Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad, which was owned and operated by the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad Company (C&amp;A). Surveying for the line began on September 8, 1851, grading began on October 19, 1852, and the first track was laid on April 4, 1853. The first section of line was opened on July 18, 1853. The establishment of the Freehold &amp; Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad caused the Freeholds region to become a transportation hub. The other major railway in the area was the Central Railroad of New Jersey, which had a branch that connected the still-active former Penn Central line from Jamesburg to CNJ&#x27;s Seashore Branch and the New York and Long Branch line (now owned by NJ Transit) at Matawan.

The Freehold and Jamesburg Railroad was abandoned by the early 1930s. A portion of the former railroad&#x27;s right-of-way was later approved to be sold by the New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners (PUC) to Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Company in 1966, with occasional freight service still being used through the Freehold Industrial Track. Meanwhile, The Central Railroad of New Jersey went into bankruptcy in the early 1970s and entered into Conrail on April 1, 1976, with its freight service on the rails from Freehold to Matawan being terminated in 1979 (the rails were removed in 1980). Today, it is mostly a rail-trail, converting into the Henry Hudson Trail. Freehold&#x27;s former train station for both of these important railway routes now serves as the central bus station for town.

The Monmouth Ocean Middlesex Line is a proposal by New Jersey Transit to restore passenger railway service to the region, by using the same tracks as the Freehold Industrial Track. The borough and its neighboring township would be potential stops for the &#x27;MOM&#x27; Line.

As of now, the nearest train stations to the borough are located in Aberdeen-Matawan, Asbury Park, Long Branch, and South Amboy on the North Jersey Coast Line, and Metropark in Iselin, Metuchen, New Brunswick, and Princeton Junction on the Northeast Corridor Line.

=====Proposed NJ Transit Village=====
With the Borough of Freehold&#x27;s determination to revitalize its downtown area, as outlined in the Freehold Center Core Revitalization Plan (2008), NJ Transit has sponsored a project in transforming the Freehold Center Bus Station into a &quot;Transit Village&quot;. This new designation would foster in the creation of a Transit-oriented development (TOD) zoning district around by the Freehold Center Bus Station between West Main Street (County Route 537) and Throckmorton Street (County Route 522).

In 2019, Freehold Borough Council members began to authorize Planning Board members &quot;to investigate if properties in the downtown district constitute an area in need of redevelopment. If board members determine redevelopment is warranted, they will prepare a redevelopment plan for the designated area.&quot; On April 20, 2020, borough council members had reached an agreement in adopting an ordinance that would purchase a new building to house as the municipal complex. The hopes of relocating the current municipal complex on West Main Street to this new location on Mechanic street would be in opening up more space for potential developers that could bid for the NJ &#x27;Transit Village&#x27;.

=====Buses=====

NJ Transit bus service connects Freehold with communities along U.S. Route 9, to Newark Liberty International Airport, to New York City, and to Six Flags Great Adventure located in Jackson Township. The 131, 135 and 139 provide service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, on the 67 to Newark, on the 64 and 67 to Jersey City and local service on the 836 and 838 routes. Bus service is available from Route 9 to Wall Street in New York&#x27;s Financial District via the Academy Bus Line.

There are also several bus stops to the points listed above located along Route 9 in the borough and in neighboring Freehold Township.

Crisscrossed by several major highways, the township is a commercial hub for Central New Jersey (home to the Freehold Raceway and Freehold Raceway Mall) and is a suburban bedroom community of New York City, located within the Raritan Valley region of the much larger New York metropolitan area. The township is located roughly away from Manhattan and about away from Staten Island. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 35,369, a decrease of 815 (−2.3%) from the 36,184 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,647 (+14.7%) from the 31,537 counted in the 2000 census.

Freehold Township was first formed on October 31, 1693, and was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of Freehold Township were taken to form Upper Freehold Township (), so some wills and official records following the split referred to &quot;Lower Freehold Township&quot; although the official name has always been Freehold Township. Additional portions formed Millstone Township (February 28, 1844), Jackson Township (March 6, 1844), Atlantic Township (February 18, 1847; now Colts Neck Township), Marlboro Township (February 17, 1848) and Manalapan Township (March 9, 1848). Freehold town was formed within the township on March 25, 1869, and formally separated when it was reconstituted as a borough on April 15, 1919, including additional portions of the township.

The Battle of Monmouth was fought in June 1778 in what has been preserved as Monmouth Battlefield State Park, which is in Freehold Township and Manalapan Township.

==History==

===Early===
The Lenni Lenape Native Americans were the earliest known people to live in the area that became Freehold. The Lenape were a hunter-gatherer society. They were largely sedentary, changing campsites seasonally. They were prolific hunters of small game and birds. They were also skilled fisherman, and were known to harvest vast amounts of clams from the bays and inlets on the Jersey Shore. They also practiced some agriculture to augment their food supply. During this time, an important crossroad of two major Lenape trails was located in the area of Freehold.

In 1498, John Cabot became the first European to sight this land. By the late 17th century, the English had begun to take over the area. In 1664, the Duke of York (later James II &amp; VII) granted a patent to Sir George Carteret to develop the area. In 1685, Scottish Presbyterians from Scotland, along with English Baptists and Quakers from New England fleeing religious persecution at home, became the first to settle within the area. In 1693, along with Middletown and Shrewsbury, Freehold was established by act of legislature as one of the three original townships in Monmouth County. The name of the township comes from the word &quot;freehold&quot;, an English legal term describing fee simple property ownership.

===Colonial===
In 1714, when the colonial government was deciding where to locate the county seat and courthouse, Freeholder John Reid, the first Surveyor General of East Jersey, wanted the county seat located in Freehold. Reid&#x27;s offer to sell the property to the Board of Chosen Freeholders at a heavily discounted price may have been the deciding factor in choosing Freehold—rather than Middletown or Shrewsbury—as the site of the county seat. As part of the deal, Reid placed a restrictive covenant in the deed that, should the property ever cease being used as a courthouse, ownership would revert to the Reid family. Direct descendants of John Reid still reside in Freehold Township.

Freehold was officially designated as the seat of the Monmouth County government, and a court house was commissioned to be built on the land purchased from John Reid. The Monmouth Courthouse opened in 1715. A small village quickly began to develop around the courthouse. At first, the village was called Monmouth Courthouse. Over time, other government buildings opened near the courthouse, including a sheriff&#x27;s office, a prison, and a post office. A number of homes and commercial businesses also sprang up in the village, including a blacksmith, a general store, a bank, a hotel, and saloon. 
In the area surrounding Monmouth Courthouse, many successful farms began to appear. The farms in Freehold were particularly well known for the production of potatoes, beans, and rye, which were sold in the markets of nearby cities. Freehold also became known for its excellent horse farms. The differences within Freehold between the growing settlement around the courthouse and the surrounding farmland were the seeds for the eventual division of Freehold into two separate municipalities in the early 20th century.

As of 1745, the majority of families in Freehold were still Scottish immigrants. In modern Freehold, many important streets bear the name of early colonial families, including Barkalow, Applegate, Rhea, Throckmorton, and Schanck.

===Revolutionary War===

Freehold was deeply impacted by the American Revolution. In 1765 with the passage of the Stamp Act, dissidents in Middletown and Upper Freehold established Sons of Liberty groups. In late 1775, Capt. Elias Longstreet recruited the first company of colonists from the county to join the Continental Army for an ill-fated invasion of Canada. Freehold was a known center of patriot activity. The Declaration of Independence was publicly proclaimed, read aloud, from the steps of the Monmouth Courthouse just a few days after being signed in Philadelphia.

After British success at the Battle of Long Island, Freehold and all of Monmouth County fell under the control of Loyalists. The British government continued to operate the Monmouth Courthouse, and several people involved in revolutionary activities were arrested and tried for treason at the courthouse. The success of the Continental Army at the Battle of Trenton helped to weaken loyalist control of Freehold.

In June 1778, the British Army began a major strategic evacuation of the city of Philadelphia. They attempted to protect a long, slow moving column of Loyalist families, equipment, and other supplies seized in Philadelphia, as they moved toward ships in New York Harbor. On June 28, 1778, the Continental Army intercepted the column in Freehold. The Battle of Monmouth was one of the largest battles of the Revolutionary War, involving over 25,000 soldiers combined in Continental, British, and Hessian forces. The initial engagement was in doubt until Washington arrived because Charles Lee was retreating from the battlefield. Washington rallied the Continentals and strongly engaged the British forces and they held their ground on the battlefield. British forces met their primary goal, the evacuation of Philadelphia. Both sides claimed victory in the battle.
Several famous figures from the Revolutionary War fought at the Battle of Monmouth. British forces were commanded by Sir Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis. The Continental Army was commanded by George Washington and Charles Lee. Charles Lee was later court martialed by the Continental Army for his actions at the Battle of Monmouth. Nathanael Greene, Alexander Hamilton, &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne, the Marquis de Lafayette and Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben also fought at the Battle of Monmouth for the Continental Army. Another famous figure at the Battle of Monmouth was Molly Pitcher, who manned a cannon during the battle after her husband was wounded.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Monmouth, Loyalist control of Freehold faltered. The township ceased to have a functioning municipal government and the courthouse was closed until the end of the war. Minor clashes between loyalists and continentals flared up in town, with the violence peaking around 1780. Colonel Tye, was an escaped slave formerly named Titus, and the leader of a prominent loyalist guerrilla force, which conducted several raids in and around Freehold. In one famous incident Joshua Huddy was captured and hung by British Loyalists under the direction of Richard Lippincott and Colonel Tye. Colonel Tye later died from injuries sustained during that raid. Patriots later cut down Huddy&#x27;s body hanging from the gallows and buried it in Freehold, at Old Tennent Church. At the end of the war, the community was deeply divided and nearly 120 loyalist families left Freehold, fearing retribution from their neighbors. Most of these families re-settled in Canada.

===19th century===
During the early 1800s, Freehold steadily grew in size. The village around the courthouse was now called Freehold, along with the surrounding farmland. In 1852, when long distance railroad systems were first being developed, a railroad station, with trains making regular stops, was built running nearly parallel with Throckmorton Street in Freehold. Freehold soon had public sewers in the village and in some of the outlying farmland. By 1883, there was an electrical grid and a telephone switchboard, at a time when these inventions were still brand new. These public advancements caused rapid economic growth in Freehold. The village of Freehold became an important commercial and industrial hub in central New Jersey. The farms in the rest of Freehold benefited greatly by being able to sell their products more easily in New York and Philadelphia. The village and the farms prospered together while the public policies sought by each continued to drift apart. The municipal government became increasingly divided between villagers and farmers.

In 1824, the American Hotel opened on Main Street in Freehold. It is still standing today and is one of the oldest buildings in Freehold. In 1853, the Freehold Raceway opened. Though the original grandstand burned down in a fire, the racetrack is still open today, and is one of the oldest harness racetracks in America. The Great Fire of Freehold happened on October 30, 1873. The fire reportedly began in a commercial building on Main Street. It soon spread to engulf a large section of the village, and many wooden buildings, including Monmouth Courthouse, were burned down.

Freehold also has a relatively forgotten but important place in the history of the bicycle. Cycling champion Arthur Augustus Zimmerman resided in the town during his racing career in the 1880s and 1890s, and from 1896 to 1899 operated the Zimmerman Bicycle Co.; the company&#x27;s bicycles were known as the &quot;Zimmy.&quot; Today, Freehold Borough is home to the Metz Bicycle Museum, where the only extant &quot;Zimmy&quot; can be seen.

===20th century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, Freehold was an increasingly divided community regarding the issue of local tax dollars used as funding for public works and infrastructure projects. The Freeholders living in the downtown area, around the courthouse had very different ideas about how to spend public money compared to the Freeholders living in the surrounding farmland. Tension within the community increased greatly in 1916 when a severe polio epidemic swept through Freehold. After contentious public debate, a referendum was held to on the future of Freehold, and voters overwhelmingly decided to split the town into two separate municipalities.

On April 15, 1919, Freehold Borough formally separated from Freehold Township. Freeholders generally refer to the different municipalities simply as the Borough and the Township. The Borough, the downtown area around the courthouse, retained all the existing government buildings around Court Street and Main Street. The Borough also kept the designation as county seat. Freehold Township, the farming communities that surrounded the courthouse, set up a new town hall complex on Schanck Road. The Township completely encircles the Borough. On September 7, 1926, Freehold Borough annexed additional territory from the Township.
In the early 20th century, the farms in Freehold Township continued to be prosperous and successful, and the area steadily grew in population. After World War II, the township experienced rapid growth. By this time, transportation systems had increased to a point to allow workers to commute daily to jobs in larger cities, such as Newark, Philadelphia, and New York City. Highways, including U.S. Route 9 and Route 33 helped to make it possible for commuters to live in Freehold and work in nearby cities. The township quickly developed large neighborhoods of suburban single family homes.

Soon, the township began to grow commercial and industrial businesses that rivaled the borough. Brockway Glass Company built their initial facility off Center Street in 1955, which was expanded in subsequent decades before it ceased operations in 1991. The site is now operated by Iron Mountain. 3M opened a magnetic tape production facility in 1957. CentraState Medical Center, a regional hospital serving western Monmouth County, southern Middlesex County, and portions of Mercer and Ocean counties, opened in 1971 as Freehold Area Hospital.

Some industrial developments in the township were negative. In 1983, the United States Environmental Protection Agency designated the Lone Pine Chemical Site as a superfund site. The site has been called &quot;one of the worst environmental disasters in the country&quot;. Based on the latest EPA five-year review in 2019, remediation work has contained the spill. In 1990, with the opening of Freehold Raceway Mall, the second-largest mall in the state, the township had solidified in being a premier commercial center for Central New Jersey.

As the township grew, Route 33, which ran through the heart of Freehold, became increasingly congested, in which studies suggested the construction of a new freeway. This was due to the fact that there was no room to widen the highway to 4 lanes between Route 9 and a railroad bridge at the eastern end would need to have been widened to accommodate 4 lanes. After several years, the new freeway was downsized to merely a bypass of Freehold. Construction from near Sweetmans Lane (CR 527) to U.S. Route 9 was finished in 1972. Eventually construction began again and the bypass was extended to Halls Mill Road in 1989. For decades traffic was detoured, and congestion continued to worsen. The delay was lengthened when an endangered species was found in the path of the proposed roadway. Finally, after 32 years of waiting, the bypass was fully completed in January 2003, reducing congestion on Route 33 and Route 33 Business, albeit not a completely four-lane highway between Halls Mills Road and the Howell Road intersection.

===21st century===
The township has thousands of jobs located within the municipality, along with a growing numbers of commuters who work in neighboring cities such as New York City, Newark, Trenton, and Philadelphia. Five residents died in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and are listed on the county&#x27;s 9/11 memorial.

The COVID-19 pandemic affected Freehold Township like many communities. Early on, it (and county at large) made news for the number of reported cases. In particular, one Freehold family named the Fuscos had made news for having lost five of their relatives during the first few months of the pandemic, with 19 other family members coming into contact with the virus. In May 2020, the township adopted an ordinance to help in simplifying the process for restaurant owners to obtain permits for seasonal outdoor dining. As of June 25, 2021, the township and county has been ahead of the Biden Administration&#x27;s Coronavirus vaccine goal, with at least 73.5% of adults receiving at least one dose, compared to the national average of 65.6% of adults receiving at least one dose.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 38.88 square miles (100.71 km2), including 38.65 square miles (100.11 km2) of land and 0.23 square miles (0.59 km2) of water (0.59%).

The township completely surrounds the borough of Freehold, making it part of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another. The township borders Colts Neck Township, Howell Township, Manalapan Township, Marlboro Township and Millstone Township in Monmouth County; and Jackson Township in Ocean County. The municipality of Upper Freehold Township is not connected, geographically or politically, to Freehold Township.

East Freehold (2010 Census population of 4,894) and West Freehold (13,613 as of 2010) are unincorporated communities and census-designated places located within Freehold Township.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Blue Ball (now Adelphia), Burlington Heights, Georgia, Monmouth Heights, Orchard Estates, Siloam, Smithburg, Southburg, Stonehurst East and Stonehurst West.

===Ecology===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Freehold Township would have an Appalachian oak (&quot;104&quot;) vegetation type with an Eastern hardwood forest (&quot;25&quot;) vegetation form.

===Major bodies of water===
Due to the township&#x27;s location in New Jersey, it is the home of numerous headwaters for various important rivers, brooks, and streams that flow throughout the state. The township is located on a ridge within the geographic heartland of New Jersey, as most sections of the township fall within the hillier terrain and fertile soil found in the Inner coastal plain, while the southeastern sections of the township fall within the more flat terrain and sandier soil found in the Outer coastal plain.

Most of the township is located within the much larger Raritan Valley region (as many of its brooks and streams flow into the aforementioned river), while also being located relatively close to the Raritan Bay. The township is also closely tied to the Jersey Shore region, being located about west of Asbury Park. The northernmost stretches of the Pine Barrens reach into a small section of the southern portion of the township, as it is one of only two municipalities in Monmouth County that are part of the Toms River watershed, most of which is located in Ocean County in the aforementioned Pine Barrens. Notable bodies of water within the township include:

==Historic district==
The Monmouth Battlefield Historic District is a historic district within the much larger Monmouth Battlefield State Park, located on both sides of County Route 522 (Freehold-Englishtown Road) and west of U.S. Route 9 on the border of Freehold Township and Manalapan Township.

The site of the battlefield originally contained many colonial-era farmhouses though many did not survive the rapid development of the area in the 20th century. Three of the original seven farmhouses that were present during the battle are still standing in the park. These include the Sutfin Farmhouse (1731); the Rhea-Applegate House (1745); and the Craig House (1746).

Three homes were built on the battlefield. The Conover-Perrine House (1832) is to the north of the park, erected on the site of the original 18th-century Perrine House, an important example of late Federal Architecture. The Italianate Cobb House was later constructed in 1872 near the Conover-Perrine House. The Combs&#x27; Farmhouse (mid-18th Century) was demolished sometime in the 1960s and was located near the park&#x27;s playground and ice pond.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, for its significance in military history and for the remaining settlement of colonial architecture and agriculture akin to the fated events of the Battle of Monmouth.

====Public transportation====
=====Rail=====
In the 19th &amp; 20th centuries, Freehold Borough and Freehold Township had two major railways. One major railway in the area was the Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad, which was owned and operated by the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad Company (C&amp;A). Surveying for the line began on September 8, 1851, grading began on October 19, 1852, and the first track was laid on April 4, 1853. The first section of line was opened on July 18, 1853. The establishment of the Freehold &amp; Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad helped make the Freeholds a transportation hub. The other major railway in the area was the Central Railroad of New Jersey, which had a branch that connected the still-active former Penn Central line from Jamesburg to CNJ&#x27;s Seashore Branch and the New York and Long Branch line (now owned by NJ Transit) at Matawan.

The Freehold and Jamesburg Railroad was abandoned by the early 1930s. A portion of the former railroad&#x27;s right-of-way was later approved to be sold by the New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners (PUC) to Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Company in 1966, with occasional freight service still being used through the Freehold Industrial Track. Meanwhile, The Central Railroad of New Jersey went into bankruptcy in the early 1970s and entered into Conrail on April 1, 1976, with its freight service on the rails from Freehold to Matawan being terminated in 1979 (the rails were removed in 1980). Today, it is mostly a rail-trail, converting into the Henry Hudson Trail.

The Monmouth Ocean Middlesex Line is a proposal by New Jersey Transit to restore passenger railway service to the region, by using the same tracks as the Freehold Industrial Track. The township and its neighboring borough would be potential stops for the &#x27;MOM&#x27; Line.

As of now, the nearest train stations to the township are located at Aberdeen-Matawan, Asbury Park and Long Branch on the North Jersey Coast Line, and Metropark (in Iselin), New Brunswick and Princeton Junction on the Northeast Corridor Line.

=====Buses=====
NJ Transit provides bus service to communities along US Route 9 from Lakewood Township to Old Bridge Township, and to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City via bus routes 131, 135 and 139, to Newark Liberty International Airport and Newark at large on the 67 route, to Jersey City on the 64 and 67, as well as shopping via local service on the 833, and 836 routes. Bus service is available from Route 9 to Wall Street in New York&#x27;s Financial District via the Academy Bus Line.

There are several bus stops to the points listed above located along Route 9 in the township. Freehold Township has two commuter parking lots available only to township residents, which are located at the Freehold Mall Shopping Center and on Schibanoff Lane.

=====Aviation=====
Following the closure of the Marlboro Airport, Old Bridge Airport in Old Bridge and Monmouth Executive Airport in Farmingdale supply short-distance flights to surrounding areas and are the closest air transportation services. The nearest major commercial airports are Trenton-Mercer Airport, which serves several domestic destinations via Frontier Airlines and located west (about 36 minutes drive); and Newark Liberty International Airport, which serves as a major hub for United Airlines and located north (about 50 minutes drive) from the center of Freehold Township.

Ferry service is available through the SeaStreak service in Highlands, a trip that involves about a 25–30-minute drive from the eastern section of Freehold Township to reach the departing terminal. SeaStreak offers ferry service to New York City with trips to Pier 11 (on the East River at Wall Street) and 35th Street in Manhattan.

<text>Hazlet is a township in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is located near the Raritan Bay within the Raritan Valley region. It is located in the New York Metropolitan Area and is a bedroom community of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 20,125, a decrease of 209 (−1.0%) from the 2010 census count of 20,334, which in turn reflected a decline of 1,044 (−4.9%) from the 21,378 counted in the 2000 census.

== History ==
What is now Hazlet Township was originally incorporated as Raritan Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 25, 1848, from portions of Middletown Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Holmdel Township (February 23, 1857), Matawan Township (also February 23, 1857, now Aberdeen Township), Keyport (March 17, 1870), Keansburg (March 26, 1917) and Union Beach (March 16, 1925). The township was renamed &quot;Hazlet Township&quot; as of November 28, 1967, based on the results of a referendum held on November 7, 1967. Hazlet derives its name from Dr. John Hazlett, who had an estate in Raritan Township near the Keyport-Holmdel Turnpike, now Holmdel Road.

Hazlet was the site of the last drive-in movie theater in New Jersey, the Route 35 Drive-In, which closed in 1991, until the Delsea Drive-In in Vineland reopened in 2004.

Hazlet was part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area&#x27;s economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, dense residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural environment of the Raritan Bayshore coastline. The plan has since been integrated into the 2016 Monmouth County Master Plan.

<text>:&quot;See also New York–New Jersey Highlands for the northwestern part of New Jersey.&quot;

Highlands is a borough in northern Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A historic waterfront community located on the Raritan Bay within the Raritan Valley region, this scenic borough is a commuter town of New York City in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,621, a decrease of 384 (−7.7%) from the 2010 census count of 5,005, which in turn reflected a decline of 92 (−1.8%) from the 5,097 counted in the 2000 census. The eastern part of the town is on a high bluff that overlooks Sandy Hook Bay, the entrance to New York Harbor, and the Atlantic Ocean, from which the borough derives its name. Atop this bluff are the Navesink Twin Lights.

Highlands was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 22, 1900, from parts of Middletown Township. Additional parts of Middletown Township were annexed in 1914.

Highlands was part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area&#x27;s economy by emphasizing the traditional downtowns, residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural environment of the Raritan Bayshore coastline. The plan has since been integrated into the 2016 Monmouth County Master Plan.

On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy struck the eastern seaboard of the United States, making landfall just north of Atlantic City, before causing significant damage to businesses and homes in the borough.

==History==
Giovanni da Verrazzano explored the area known today as Highlands in 1525. During the next two centuries, the Highlands area would welcome English and Dutch settlers. Even by the 20th Century, many immigrants saw the hills of the Highlands of Navesink which were almost above sea level.

The oldest route to the eastern coast of the United States is the Minisink Trail which started on the upper Delaware River, came through northern New Jersey and ended at the Navesink River. Navesink means &quot;good fishing spot&quot; in the native tongue at the time. The trail was used by Native Americans, such as the Algonquin and Lenni Lenape tribes. They came from all over New Jersey to spend the summer fishing and finding clams. The Newasunks, Raritans, and Sachem Papomorga (or Lenni Lenape) were the most prevalent tribes and stayed the longest. These were the tribes which mostly traded with early settlers.

One year after Verrazzano explored the area, Portuguese explorer Estevan Gomez visited the Highlands of Navesink and created the first maps of the area. These were the maps in which Sandy Hook was first drawn and called &quot;Cabo de Arenas&quot; or &quot;Cape of Sands.&quot;

In 1609, Henry Hudson sailed into the Sandy Hook Bay and wrote: &quot;This is very good land to fall in with and a pleasant land to see. Our men went on land, so they went up into the woods and saw great stores of very goodly oaks and some currants&quot;. One of Hudson&#x27;s crew became the first man killed by Native Americans who were frightened by his scouting party.

Many years after Hudson&#x27;s trip to the area, the Highlands of Navesink saw a number of Dutch who traded with the Navesink Indians and prepared nautical charts. William Reape, one of the Dutch, made a bargain with the local natives to trade land in exchange for rum, blankets and gunpowder.

Eventually, the Dutch settlers named the land &quot;Rensselaer&#x27;s Hoeck,&quot; but British settlers took over and renamed the settlement &quot;Portland&quot; in 1664. The group purchasing the land included James Hubbard, John Bawne, John Tilton Jr., Richard Stout, William Goulding and Samuel Spear.

Three years later, in 1677, Richard Hartshorne purchased a tract of land from the Native Americans which provided him with control of nearly all of Sandy Hook and Highlands which was then called &quot;Portland Poynt.&quot; Hartshorne and his family became the first permanent settlers of the area.

Some early settlers soon realized the importance Highlands and Sandy Hook would have in the defense of the country. People in Highlands and Sandy Hook could warn New York of any enemies approaching by sea and also to help guide ships into New York Harbor. In 1762, New York merchants purchased a site from the Hartshorne family for a light house. Two years later, the Sandy Hook Light House was lighted for the first time.

The hills of the Highlands of Navesink and Sandy Hook also played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. It was a vital strategic site for the British and Colonial Armies. When the British fleet arrived close to Sandy Hook in 1776, sympathizers with the British built fortifications and with the help of the British were able to hold Sandy Hook for the remainder of the Revolutionary War. The Loyalists stayed in control of Sandy Hook even after the war was ended by the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781.

Captain Joshua Huddy was the eldest of seven brothers and a member of the Monmouth Continental Militia. He pursued gangs of Tory (Loyalist) refugees who plundered the area searching for American rebels. The refugees made Huddy a target and tried to kill him several times. Unfortunately, one of the Loyalists&#x27; raids from Sandy Hook ended with setting Huddy&#x27;s house on fire. Huddy agreed to surrender if they would help him to put out the fire. They agreed and took Huddy as a prisoner. The fire from the house had attracted the attention of Huddy&#x27;s neighbors and the local militia raced after the Tories, catching them before they could reach their boats at Black Point in Rumson. In the fight that ensued, Huddy escaped.

However, two years later the Loyalists captured Huddy and brought him to Gravelly Point in Highlands where he was allowed to write his will. Then Huddy was hanged for the death of Captain Philip White who had been captured by Rebels earlier in Long Branch and shot while being transported to Freehold. Huddy was not involved in the shooting, as he was in a British prison at the time, but was hanged anyway. His body was carried by patriots to Freehold and buried. Today, a monument in Huddy Park honors Captain Joshua Huddy.

In 1796, the first hotel in the Highlands of Navesink was built and many other hotels were built until the War of 1812. Two years later, the tourism began to grow and new hotels were built on Sandy Hook and on the hills of Highlands. In addition, a number of new homes were being built and visitors were coming to Highlands by the boatload.

Author James Fenimore Cooper, author of &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;, also wrote &quot;Water Witch&quot;, a novel which was inspired by his visits to Highlands. Walt Whitman, one of America&#x27;s most famous poets, celebrated his excursions to Highlands in his journals and a group of his poems entitled, &quot;Fancies at Navesink.&quot;

By 1880, numerous hotels, beach pavilions and private clubs were flourishing in Highlands. It was the beginning of a glorious era for the small town on the Shrewsbury River. Trains and steamships brought vacationers to celebrate post-Civil War prosperity.

New York theatrical producers and famous actors built summer homes in Highlands. The area became so popular that &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; sent a journalist down nearly every summer in the 1870s and 1880s to write about the community and its people.

The Seashore Railroad had been built on the Sandy Hook peninsula during 1865 and a ferry service was established to take passengers across the river from Highlands to his hotel on Sandy Hook. Then a bridge was constructed in 1872 and the ferry service ceased operations. The new drawbridge was about and wide. It was constructed at a cost of $35,000 and opened in 1872, but was closed for three years when a schooner ran into it in 1875. By 1883, a railroad came to Atlantic Highlands and in 1892 the old draw bridge at Highlands was torn down and a new railroad bridge was built by the New Jersey Central Railroad Company for their coastal line. This new bridge for rail, vehicular, and foot traffic was opened in 1892.

On Lighthouse Hill were the Twin Lights which is one of the most historic sites in the nation. Built in 1862, it was the first twin light house, the first electric powered light, the first glimpse of America for incoming ships, the first in the nation to use the Fresnel lens, the first to use wireless telegraphy, and the site of the first experiments with radar.

Light House Hill (also known as Beacon Hill) was employed as a site for a beacon as early as 1746, when England was in conflict with France in the War of Austrian Succession, and the colonies of both were up for grabs. The beacon—whale oil burned in pots—was not only to welcome sailors, but to warn citizens that the French were coming up the harbor and it was time to take down the musket from over the fireplace. During the Revolutionary War, the beacon served the same purpose, only Britain was the enemy.

In 1899, Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy demonstrated his invention at the Twin Lights so the &quot;New York Herald&quot; could be the first to have news of the 1899 America&#x27;s Cup races to be run off the New Jersey Coast.

By the 1920s, Highlands was a popular tourist destination. By 1932, however, century-long steamboat operations on the Shrewsbury and Navesink Rivers came quickly to an end.

Before World War II, the northern tower was the first place where experiments with radar were held. So successful were the tests that, soon after the war, radar was the major tool of navigation and the government decided to decommission the Twin Lights and abandon the building as an operative light house.

During 1900, Highlands was incorporated and passed an ordinance prohibiting horses, cows and pigs from running loose on the streets. It also ordered that three-inch hemlock and chestnut planking be used as curbs along the officially designated streets.

By 1920 the &quot;manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors&quot; was prohibited. However, &quot;rum-running&quot; was a common practice for New Jersey&#x27;s beachfront and Highlands became the main port for the infamous trade. Highlands also had great boat-building facilities which could produce boats faster than the authorities could catch. The Jersey Skiff, designed and built in Highlands, became the primary craft to be used in the smuggling operations.

Highlands became known for sport fishing in the 1920s. Today, countless boats can be seen in the rivers, bays and ocean to catch fluke, bluefish, striped bass or whiting.

Clamming was an important activity here for the Native Americans and the first settlers learned from them. A writer in 1890 reported that clams were to Parkertown what the whale once was to Nantucket.

Gertrude Ederle spent all of her summers in Highlands and learned to swim at the beach on Miller Street. She would swim from Sandy Hook to the Highlands Bridge in two hours and forty minutes to train for her famous English Channel swim in 1926. She became the first woman to swim the English Channel, and also the first to be given a ticker-tape parade on Broadway. Ederle attended the 1975 dedication of a park in Highlands named in her honor.

During 1975, all military installations on Sandy Hook (except for the U.S. Coast Guard) were decommissioned and the land was given to the National Park Service to become the Gateway National Recreation Area.

In 2012, during Hurricane Sandy, the borough was heavily damaged when a storm surge of nearly swept in from the bay beginning October 28. Most homes and businesses, including the Bahrs Landing and Lusty Lobster fishery were either damaged or totally destroyed. With 80% of homes and most businesses severely damaged by the storm, considerations were made for a $25 million project to raise the borough by about as a long-term solution to flooding.

<text>Howell Township is a township in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is the largest municipality in the county by total area, comprising about . It is located in the New York metropolitan area and has been a steadily growing bedroom community of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 53,537, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 2,462 (+4.8%) from the 2010 census count of 51,075, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,172 (+4.4%) from the 48,903 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Howell Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 23, 1801, from portions of Shrewsbury Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Brick Township in the newly created Ocean County (February 15, 1850), Wall Township (March 7, 1851) and Farmingdale (April 8, 1903). The township was named for Richard Howell, who served from 1794 to 1801 as the third Governor of New Jersey.

Founded in 1822 by engineer and philanthropist James P. Allaire, the Howell Works provided iron for Allaire Iron Works, which was a leading supplier of iron in the 19th century. Allaire Village was a bustling mill town at the height of the mining operations and it has been preserved as Allaire State Park, which is in Howell Township and Wall Township.

Some scenes for the &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; 2005 remake were filmed here, and a neighborhood called Ardena Acres was recreated as a set and left standing in Universal Studios Hollywood.

In June 2017, two separate tornadoes, both rated EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, struck minutes and miles apart. The first one struck the Fort Plains area, damaging a Home Depot, Chase Bank, a strip mall, and a local ice cream parlor. The second one struck a park in the Oak Glen area.

Roughly six years later in April 2023, a tornado rated EF-2 struck Howell and neighboring Jackson Township near the Aldrich Road area. The National Weather Service confirmed that the tornado was 50 yards wide and 1.4 miles in length. It was one of the strongest tornadoes to have hit the state, as it was part of four separate powerful tornadoes that had also impacted the state that same day.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 61.21 square miles (158.54 km2), including 60.27 square miles (156.10 km2) of land and 0.94 square miles (2.44 km2) of water (1.54%).

Howell was formed from territory taken from Shrewsbury Township under an act of the New Jersey General Assembly passed February 23, 1801. The township, as formed, included in addition to its present area all of what is now Wall Township, Lakewood Township, Brick Township, and all the boroughs along the Atlantic Ocean from Barnegat Inlet of the Shark River Inlet at Belmar.

Ramtown (with a 2010 Census population of 6,242) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Howell Township.

The township completely surrounds Farmingdale, making it part of 21 pairs of &quot;doughnut towns&quot; in the state, where one municipality entirely surrounds another. The township borders Colts Neck Township, Freehold Township and Wall Township in Monmouth County; and Brick Township, Jackson Township and Lakewood Township in Ocean County.

<text>Interlaken is a borough situated in the Jersey Shore region, within Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 828, an increase of 8 (+1.0%) from the 2010 census count of 820, which in turn had reflected a decline of 80 (−8.9%) from the 900 counted in the 2000 census.

Interlaken was authorized for prospective incorporation as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 11, 1922, from portions of Ocean Township, subject to approval by a majority of voters in the affected area. Voters approved the incorporation of Interlaken in a referendum held on May 3, 1922.

Interlaken is a dry town where alcohol is not permitted to be sold by law.

==History==
The area that is now Interlaken was purchased in 1667 by Gavin Drummond from the Lenape Native Americans. It was later part of Ocean Township, which had seceded from Shrewsbury Township in 1849 and included at the time present-day Eatontown, Neptune Township, Neptune City, Avon-by-the-Sea, Bradley Beach, Asbury Park, Allenhurst, Deal, Long Branch, West Long Branch, Loch Arbour, Monmouth Beach, Sea Bright, and Oceanport, along with Interlaken itself.

Dr. Francis Weld, a Boston physician, bought a tract and named it Interlaken Farm, after Interlaken, a peninsula in Switzerland situated between two lakes, that they had just visited, which was similar to the borough&#x27;s location between two sections of Deal Lake. Weld established the Interlaken Land Company in 1890 to turn his farm into a residential community with avenues named after English lakes and cross streets named after the islands in the Hebrides in the Irish Sea. While the initial effort did not succeed, the Stormfelz-Lovely-Neville Company was hired in 1905 to continue the building project, and the community began its growth.

Interlaken was formed as a borough on March 11, 1922, based on the results of a referendum held on May 3, 1922. The first mayor and council of Interlaken were seated on June 26, 1922.

<doc id="125476" wikidata="Q1085417" url="?curid=125476" title="Keansburg, New Jersey">
<text>Keansburg ( ) is a borough in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 9,755, a decrease of 350 (−3.5%) from the 2010 census count of 10,105, which in turn reflected a decline of 627 (−5.8%) from 10,732 in the 2000 census.

Keansburg was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 26, 1917, from portions of both Middletown Township and Raritan Township (now Hazlet), based on the results of a referendum held on April 17, 1917.

Keansburg was part of the Bayshore Regional Strategic Plan, an effort by nine municipalities in northern Monmouth County to reinvigorate the area&#x27;s economy by emphasizing its traditional downtowns, dense residential neighborhoods, maritime history, and the natural beauty of the Raritan Bay coastline. The plan has since been integrated into the 2016 Monmouth County Master Plan.

==History==

The land that is now Keansburg was earlier home to Lenni Lenape Native Americans.

On September 3, 1609, the &quot;Half Moon&quot;, captained by Henry Hudson, is said to have landed on the shores of present-day Keansburg (although some historians argue that the landing and forthcoming explained events took place at the tip of Sandy Hook). Crewmen of the ship were attacked by the Native Americans when they departed the ship, and John Colman was killed, making him what is said to be the first European to be murdered by a Native American. He is believed to have been buried in the area that is today the intersection of Carr Avenue and Beachway in an area known as &quot;Colman&#x27;s Point&quot;.
In the time between 1609 and the early 18th century, the land was gradually purchased from the Lenni Lenape, together with other surrounding areas. The area was inhabited by Dutch, English, and Scottish settlers. In the 18th century, farming proved to be successful on Keansburg&#x27;s land, with specialties being pears, apples and corn (maize).
In this time, the settlement took on the name of Waackaack (pronounced &quot;Way-kay-ack&quot;), which came from the term &quot;Wakioak&quot; in the Lenape language meaning &quot;Land of Plenty&quot;. The area was also widely known as Tanner&#x27;s Landing from the early 18th century until approximately 1820, so named for the pier at the end of what was Tanner&#x27;s Landing Road (now Main Street). Tanner&#x27;s Landing was a principal port for the area for many years.

The area adopted its second official name of Granville, which derived from the importance of the Phillips Mill, and the grain-producing farms in the region. The name held until the 1880s. During the century, Granville became home to its own church, two lighthouses and small businesses. Roadways were beginning to form from repeated use of horse and buggies. The beach was already a favorite to visitors. Population was about 300 people, who mostly farmed and clammed for a living.

On Sunday, March 22, 1877, at &quot;half past 9 o&#x27;clock,&quot; Granville welcomed the newly assigned pastor of the Granville Methodist Episcopal Church, William W. Ramsay. He later stated: &quot;I arrived at the Granville Methodist Episcopal Church in Keansburg as pastor for the ensuing year. I soon learned that the hamlet consisted of about 300 inhabitants, whose occupations were mainly devoted to clamming &amp; farming.&quot; At 19 years of age, Ramsay was slated to serve in the church for just one year. His success at the helm of church led to another year in Granville, after which he decided to make the village his permanent home. Ramsay and his wife, Eliza S. Wood, purchased the land that is 69 Church Street and opened a general store in 1881. In the coming years, Ramsay took greater and greater interest in Granville and eventually arranged a petition to establish a post office. The list of 132 names was passed on to John Kean of Elizabeth, a candidate for Congress. His efforts led to the opening of the post office in 1884, with Mrs. Ramsay serving as its first postmaster. That year, the name Keansburg was adopted in Kean&#x27;s honor. A school was built at the cost of $30,000 in 1890 and sat on what is today the corner of Myrtle Avenue and Church Street (now Fallon Manor).

Further development continued with the creation of postcards depicting the village and land purchases, including acquisitions by William A. Gehlhaus and the Keansburg Beach Company. The Keansburg Steamboat Company was founded in 1910 primarily by Gelhaus as a means of providing transportation for New Yorkers who were interested in buying homes in Keansburg. In 1893, Gelhaus purchased a bakery business in Atlantic Highlands which he operated with his brothers until 1905. At that time he entered the real estate business in Keansburg. He was president of the New Point Comfort Beach Company which he formed with Jesse Sculthorp and Howard Roberts. The company owned a large real estate development in Keansburg and in 1906 laid out the Beachway. On June 18, 1909, the New Point Comfort Beach Company bought the steamboat &quot;Accomack&quot; in Norfolk, Virginia, and started a scheduled run from New York to Keansburg on July 1 that was intended as a way to bring prospective property buyers to Keansburg. Another real estate developer, Keansburg Heights Development Co., bought several thousand tickets. By July 21, more than $1,500 worth of tickets had been sold at $0.35 each. As the town became more populated, the Keansburg Beach Company sold off most of the surrounding land on Beachway Ave., keeping &quot;just the boardwalk and amusement area.&quot;
Tourists from New York City would ferry over and spend the weekend or summer vacation to escape the city heat, until Hurricane Donna wiped out much of the waterfront area in 1960. In 1969, the borough spent $7.9 million on the Bayshore Hurricane Protection Plan, which had been developed with state and federal funding from The New Jersey Bureau of Navigation and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The redevelopment plan increased the size of the beaches to protect against future storms. A number of fires in the 1980s destroyed several structures on the North side of Beachway Avenue. The Dance Hall Auditorium, Keansburg Bowling Alley and the Casino Theater were destroyed by fire during this time.

The Gelhaus family re-acquired the Keansburg Amusement Park in 1995, following a 20-year absence after Henry Gelhaus had sold the property in 1972. The return of the Gelhaus family as proprietors of the amusement park sparked a resurgence of interest in the town. Upgrades were made to the amusement park grounds and a water park was constructed. Runaway rapids was opened in 1996 on the site of the former Crystal Pool. The Keansburg Waterfront Public Library, founded in 2004, was the result of a concerted effort on the part of townspeople and the borough government to provide a high quality library with resources that address the needs and interests of the community. In 2012, the town added a $3 million desalination plant with Federal Stimulus Funds and a low interest loan from the N.J. Environmental Infrastructure Trust, which greatly improved the quality of the water supply. The town had previously stopped providing well water, as saltwater intrusion into the aquifer had exceeded environmental protection standards. The new facility removes contaminants from the water supply through reverse osmosis.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 16.79 square miles (43.47 km2), including 1.07 square miles (2.78 km2) of land and 15.71 square miles (40.70 km2) of water (93.59%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Beacon Beach, Point Comfort and Tiltons Corner.

The borough has land borders with the Monmouth County municipalities of Hazlet Township, Middletown Township and Union Beach; and has maritime borders with Aberdeen Township and Keyport, and the New York City borough of Staten Island across Raritan Bay. A small piece of Middletown Township measuring is an exclave completely surrounded by Keansburg.

==Emergency services==
The current Keansburg Police Department was created under an ordinance adopted in November 1926 which consisted of five members. The area known as Keansburg was under the authority of a Police Marshal prior to 1926. Before 1917, the area was patrolled by both Raritan Township (now Hazlet) and Middletown Township. The borough&#x27;s first Police Marshal was James Gilligan, who was appointed in 1917 who served until his retirement in August 1943. The Chief of Police is Andrew Gogan.

Keansburg is served by two volunteer fire companies, Keansburg Fire Company No. 1 and New Point Comfort Fire Company No. 1.

Keansburg Fire Company #1, located on the corner of Main Street and Manning Place, was incorporated on October 13, 1912, making it the first fire company in the community.

New Point Comfort Volunteer Fire Company was organized in 1912 and incorporated on August 2, 1913 at the New Point Comfort Hotel located on Beachway Avenue. The company was first named the New Point Comfort Chemical Engine Company, and was later renamed the New Point Comfort Fire Company #1 in 1921. Having its first building on Oak Street, it later moved to a larger property at 192 Carr Avenue in 1959, where it is currently located.

The borough&#x27;s two volunteer companies make up the Keansburg Fire Department, which was established in 1923. The chiefs of the two companies rotate as Chief and Assistant Chief of the Keansburg Fire Department. In even years the Chief of the Keansburg Fire Company #1 serves as Chief of the Keansburg Fire Department and the Chief of the New Point Comfort Volunteer Fire Company serving as Assistant Chief, while the roles are reversed in odd-numbered years.

In November 1998, the fire company established the Keansburg EMS and housed it on their property, where it is now a separate organization, responding to over 1,600 calls each year in only a one-square-mile area.

==Education==
Students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade are served by the Keansburg School District. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide that were established pursuant to the decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in &quot;Abbott v. Burke&quot; which are now referred to as &quot;SDA Districts&quot; based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority. As of the 2018–19 school year, the district, comprised of four schools, had an enrollment of 1,642 students and 185.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 8.9:1. Schools in the district (with 2018–19 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are:
Keansburg Preschool with 199 students in grade Pre-K, 
Joseph C. Caruso School with 668 students in grades K–4, 
Joseph R. Bolger Middle School with 348 students in grades 6–8 and 
Keansburg High School with 384 students in grades 9–12. At the start of the 2016–17 school year, the Port Monmouth Road School (which had 501 students in grades Pre-K–2) was closed with the opening of the new Joseph C. Caruso School for grades K–4. The school was constructed at a cost of $51 million.
