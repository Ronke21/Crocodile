<text>Claremont is the only city in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 12,949 at the 2020 census. Claremont is a core city of the Lebanon–Claremont micropolitan area, a bi-state, four-county region in the upper Connecticut River valley.

==History==
===Pre-colonial native populations===

The Upper Connecticut River Valley was home to the Pennacook and Western Abenaki (Sokoki) peoples, later merging with members of other Algonquin tribes displaced by the wars and famines that accompanied the European settling of the region. The Hunter Archeological Site, located near the bridge connecting Claremont with Ascutney, Vermont, is a significant prehistoric Native American site that includes seven levels of occupational evidence, including evidence of at least three longhouses. The oldest dates recorded from evidence gathered during excavations in 1967 were to 1300 CE.

===Colonial settlement===
The city was named after Claremont, the country mansion of Thomas Pelham-Holles, Earl of Clare. On October 26, 1764, colonial governor Benning Wentworth granted the township to Josiah Willard, Samuel Ashley and 67 others. Although first settled in 1762 by Moses Spafford and David Lynde, many of the proprietors arrived in 1767, with a large number from Farmington, Hebron and Colchester, Connecticut. The undulating surface of rich, gravelly loam made agriculture an early occupation. Spafford was deeded land from Col. Samuel Ashley, who was given a charter to establish a ferry across the Connecticut River in 1784, the location of which is still known as Ashley&#x27;s Ferry landing. Spafford was also the first man to marry in Claremont, and his son, Elijah, was the first white child to be born in the town.

The Union Episcopal Church in West Claremont was built in 1773, and is the oldest surviving Episcopal church building in New Hampshire and the state&#x27;s oldest surviving building built exclusively for religious purposes. The parish was organized in 1771 and chartered by the New Hampshire legislature in 1794 as Union Church Parish. Located across the street, Old St. Mary&#x27;s Church, built in 1823 mostly in the Federal style, was the first Roman Catholic church in New Hampshire. It was discontinued in 1870 in favor of the new St. Mary&#x27;s Church in the Lower Village District.

During the American Revolution, Claremont had a large number of Loyalists, who used a small wooded valley in West Claremont called the &quot;Tory Hole&quot; to hide from the Patriots. In 1777, when the New Hampshire Grants declared their own sovereignty as the Vermont Republic, Claremont was one of sixteen New Hampshire towns inclined to join them, and made multiple attempts to do so.

===Industry===
Claremont&#x27;s first millwright was Col. Benjamin Tyler, who arrived in the area from Farmington, Connecticut, in the spring of 1767. Tyler built mills using stone quarried from his land on nearby Mount Ascutney, and built Claremont&#x27;s first mill on the Sugar River on the site of the Coy Paper Mill. Tyler also invented the wry-fly water wheel, which was the subject of the Supreme Court case &quot;Tyler v. Tuel&quot;. His grandson John Tyler evolved the technology to create the Tyler Water Wheel and the Tyler Turbine. John Tyler&#x27;s grandson was Benjamin Tyler Henry, inventor of the Henry Repeating rifle, manufactured in neighboring Windsor, Vermont, and used in the Civil War.

The water power harnessed from the Sugar River brought the town prosperity during the Industrial Revolution. Large brick factories were built along the stream, including the Sunapee Mills, Monadnock Mills, Claremont Machine Works, Home Mills, Sanford &amp; Rossiter, and Claremont Manufacturing Company. Principal products were cotton and woolen textiles, lathes and planers, and paper. Although like other New England mill towns, much industry moved away or closed in the 20th century, the city&#x27;s former prosperity is evident in some fine Victorian architecture, including the 1897 city hall and opera house.

In 1874, businesses in Claremont included Monadnock Mills, manufacturing cotton cloths from one to three yards wide, Marseilles quilts, union flannels, and lumber, and employing 125 males and 225 females; Home Mill (A. Briggs &amp; Co.) producing cotton cloth and employing 8 males and 20 females; Sullivan Machine Co., manufacturing Steam Dimond Drill Machinery for quarrying rock, turbine water wheels, cloth measuring machines, and doing general machine and mill work, employing 56 males; Sugar River Paper Mill Co., manufacturing printing paper and employing 30 males and 20 females; Claremont Manufacturing Co., manufacturing paper and books, and doing stereotyping and book and job printing, employing 34 males and 34 females; Russell Jarvis, manufacturing hanging paper and employing 7 males and 2 females; John S. Farrington, manufacturing straw wrapping paper and employing 5 males and 1 female; Sullivan Mills (George L. Balcom), manufacturing black doeskins and employing 20 males and 18 females; Charles H. Eastman, in the leather business and employing 4 males; Sugar River Mill Co., manufacturing flour, feed, and doing custom grinding, and employing 8 males; three saw mills employing a part of the year, 10 males; Blood &amp; Woodcock, in the business of monuments and grave stones and employing 8 males; and Houghton, Bucknam &amp; Co., in the business of sashes, doors and blinds, employing 8 males.

The Monadnock Mills Co. and Sullivan Mills Co. were responsible for the two most prominent collections of manufacturing structures in the Lower Village District. Monadnock Mills&#x27; textile operations began with its founding in 1842, and lasted through 1932, shuttering operations following the decline of the textile industry in New England during the 1920s. By the 1920s, Sullivan Mills Co. had become New Hampshire&#x27;s largest machining company, as well as Claremont&#x27;s largest employer. Sullivan&#x27;s Machinery division merged with Joy Mining Machinery in 1946, becoming Joy Manufacturing Co. Its founder, inventor Joseph Francis Joy, stayed on as general manager of the facility, which remained the dominant employer in Claremont through the 1970s, when manufacturing technology had advanced sufficiently to hamper sales and productivity. Parts of the campus suffered fires in 1979 and 1981, and the branch was closed in 1983 and sold in 1984.

===Educational history===
In the 1850s, the city of Claremont approached the state legislature asking permission to build a public high school. At the time, public high schools did not exist in New Hampshire. The state agreed, and decided to offer permission to every town in the state so that every town could establish public high schools. Claremont native and hotelier Paran Stevens then made an offer to fund 50% of the $20,000 cost of development, resulting in Stevens High School.

In March 1989, the Claremont School Board voted to initiate a lawsuit against the State of New Hampshire, claiming that the state&#x27;s primary reliance upon local property taxes for funding education resulted in inequitable educational opportunities among children around the state and a violation of their constitutional rights. Following a lawsuit and a series of landmark decisions, the New Hampshire Supreme Court agreed. Known as the &quot;Claremont Decision&quot;, the suit continues to drive the statewide debate on equitable funding for education, and Claremont continues to play a primary role in this legal challenge.

===Namesakes===
The cities of Claremont, California, Claremont, Minnesota, and Claremont Township, Minnesota, were named for Claremont, New Hampshire.

==Arts and culture==

A commercial area centered on Washington Street is Claremont&#x27;s primary commercial district. An Italian Renaissance-styled City Hall building, which houses the historic Claremont Opera House, was built in 1897 and designed by architect Charles A. Rich. City Hall faces Broad Street Park, a rotary-style town square. This square connects Washington Street, Broad Street, and Main Street, which branch into different portions of the city. Broad Street Park contains war monuments to World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam, and Freedom Garden Memorial dedicated to the victims and families of September 11. Included are two Civil War cannon and the centrally-located Soldier&#x27;s Monument, designed by Martin Milmore and dating to 1890. The park is also home to a historic bandstand, originally built in a Victorian style in 1890 and redesigned in 1922 in a Classical Revival style, which primarily serves as performance space for the Claremont American Band, a community band dating to about 1880. Parallel to Broad Street lies Pleasant Street, home to a downtown business district, which was the city&#x27;s primary commercial zone until the development of the Washington Street district.

A number of mill buildings dot the Lower Village District in the city&#x27;s center, along the Sugar River, and several attempts have been made at historic preservation of some of them.

To the north end of the town lies the Valley Regional Hospital, an out-patient resource of the popular Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center of Lebanon.

On the southern artery out of Claremont, Route 12, stood Highland View, the summer home of Claremont native William Henry Harrison Moody (1842–1925), who made his fortunes as a businessman and shoe manufacturer in the Boston area, but kept a residence in his hometown until his death. The large William H. H. Moody estate was known for its horses and its five large barns (the last of which burned in 2004 from a lightning strike), which once hosted several hundred imported horses on over . Its Victorian farmhouse stands at the top of Arch Road. In March 1916, a portion of the estate was donated by Moody to the city of Claremont for a city park, the entrance of which is on Maple Avenue; facilities include tennis. A lone access road leads through a coniferous forest to the top of a hill, maintained as a large field by the city, with a large, open-air stone structure suitable for picnics. The park has several miles of interconnected walking trailways; several of these trails terminate at the Boston and Maine Railroad. 

In 2021, The Ko&#x27;asek (Co&#x27;wasuck)Traditional Band of the Sovereign Abenaki Nation, a group claiming descent of the original indigenous population in the region, acquired and was gifted several parcels of local land for use in cultural ceremonies, nature preserves and education along with growing herbs and plants. In 2024 the group claims 554 members and now owns 26.37 acres in Claremont.

==In popular culture==
Wrightsville, the fictional small-town setting in New England of many Ellery Queen novels and short stories, was based on Claremont. Ellery Queen was the pen name of cousins Frederic Dannay (1905–1982) and Manfred B. Lee (1905–1971). Betty Miller, a Claremont native, had married Manfred B. Lee in 1927. According to the Queen Spaceports website, the &quot;Claremont Eagle&quot; newspaper provided front-page coverage (on July 10, 1959) of a talk Manfred Lee gave, in which he revealed that Wrightsville was indeed based on Claremont.

Claremont was the filming location, though not the setting, of the 2006 movie &quot;Live Free or Die&quot;, co-written and co-directed by Gregg Kavet and Andy Robin and starring Aaron Stanford, Paul Schneider, Michael Rapaport, Judah Friedlander, Kevin Dunn, and Zooey Deschanel. Set in fictional Rutland, New Hampshire, it is a picaresque comedy-drama about a small-town would-be crime legend. The name of the movie derives from the motto of the Granite State.

The Topstone Mill, formerly a shoe factory and now housing a restaurant, was featured in season 8, episode 20 of &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;, airing October 24, 2012, titled &quot;Fear Factory&quot;.

Claremont was featured in the fourteenth episode of the Small Town News Podcast, an improv comedy podcast that takes listeners on a fun and silly virtual trip to a small town in America each week, in which the hosts improvise scenes inspired by local newspaper stories.

<text>Cornish is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,616 at the 2020 census. Cornish has four covered bridges. Each August, it is home to the Cornish Fair.

==History==
The town was granted in 1763 and contained an area once known as &quot;Mast Camp&quot;, because it was the shipping point for the tall masts floated down the river by English settlers. It was incorporated in 1765 by colonial governor Benning Wentworth and named for Sir Samuel Cornish, a distinguished admiral of the Royal Navy. Since the 1827 partition of Cheshire County, the town has been within Sullivan County.

Since the late 19th century, Cornish has been a well-known summer resort for artists and writers. Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens began coming to Cornish in 1885, seeking a studio away from the summer heat of New York City. Artist friends followed him, including painter and illustrator Maxfield Parrish, who designed and built his estate, the Oaks, in the area. The surrounding area became the center of the popular Cornish Art Colony. Cornish was the residence of the reclusive author J. D. Salinger from the 1950s until his death in 2010.

Until 2008, when the Smolen–Gulf Bridge opened in Ohio, Cornish had been home to the longest covered bridge (still standing) in the United States. Cornish remains home to the longest two-span covered bridge in the world. The Cornish–Windsor Covered Bridge spans the Connecticut River and was built in 1866 at an original cost of $9,000. Cornish also has three other covered bridges: the Blow-Me-Down Covered Bridge, Dingleton Hill Covered Bridge, and Kenyon Bridge.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 1.54% of the town. The Connecticut River forms the western boundary of the town, which is also the New Hampshire–Vermont border. The town is drained by direct tributaries of the Connecticut: Blow-me-down Brook, Mill Brook, and Walker Brook; and by Redwater Brook, which flows south to the Sugar River in Claremont before that river joins the Connecticut. The long ridge of Croydon Mountain follows the eastern boundary of town; the highest point in town is a knob on Croydon Mountain which reaches an elevation of above sea level. The eastern part of the town is a portion of the approximately Blue Mountain Forest Association private game preserve, also known locally as Corbin Park, named after its founder, Austin Corbin.

Cornish is dotted with several small villages, including Cornish Center, Cornish Flat, Cornish City, Cornish Mills, South Cornish, Balloch, and Squag City.

Cornish is served by state routes 12A and 120, both of which connect Claremont to the south with Lebanon to the north.

<text>Goshen is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 796 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Incorporated in 1791, Goshen was first settled in 1768 as a part of Saville (now Sunapee). The name &quot;Goshen&quot; may have been taken from Goshen, Connecticut, where many residents had relatives.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.41% of the town. Goshen is drained by the South Branch Sugar River and its tributaries Blood Brook and Gunnison Brook, and hence lies almost fully within the Connecticut River watershed. Most of the southeastern part of town is drained by Cherry Brook, one of the headwaters of the Ashuelot River, a southwestward-flowing tributary of the Connecticut, but a small area at the southeastern corner of town has the headwaters of the eastward-flowing West Branch Warner River, part of the Merrimack River watershed.

The long ridge of Mount Sunapee occupies the eastern edge of town. The highest point in Goshen is an unnamed knob on the ridge (near Goves Mountain) where the elevation reaches above sea level.

New Hampshire Route 10 passes through the western part of the town, including Goshen village, and leads north to Newport and south to Keene. New Hampshire Route 31 has its northern terminus at Route 10 and leads southeast to Hillsborough.

==History==
The town was first settled by a group from Plainfield, Connecticut. It was one of the towns incorporated by colonial governor Benning Wentworth in 1761, at the beginning of the reign of King George III. A part of Plainfield known as &quot;Meriden Parish&quot;, named for the farm of Massachusetts Governor Jonathan Belcher, became the site of Kimball Union Academy, built in 1813.

Plainfield lies on the northern edge of the enclave known as the Cornish Art Colony, which existed between 1885 and 1930. Maxfield Parrish painted the stage backdrop in the Plainfield Town Hall. Parrish purchased land close to his parents&#x27; estate in 1898, at the age of 28, and relocated after leaving Philadelphia. He designed and built his home, The Oaks, over several years, eventually also designing and building an elaborate studio some distance behind the house. Parrish lived in Plainfield for 67 years, with the exception of a several-month period in Arizona, and a nine-month period when he resided and worked in New York City. In 1910, Ernest Harold Baynes founded the Meriden Bird Club, the first institution of its type in the nation.

Great Brook, a tributary of the Mascoma River, drains the northeast corner of the town. Croydon Mountain is a high ridge that occupies the eastern edge of the town. Grantham Mountain, a peak along the ridge, is the highest point in Plainfield at above sea level.

The town is crossed by the north-south state routes 12A and 120.

===Internet===
The town is served by the provider Consolidated Communications. They provide options for both Fiber-optic and DSL, the latter being phased out in preference for the former. The new plans for fiber range in speeds from 50 megabit to 1 gigabit, and while DSL is still available, it is much slower and less reliable (although slightly cheaper) then the fiber options.

In the part of Springfield that is in the community of Eastman, there is also the internet provider Comcast which provides a high of about 300 Mb/s down and 15 Mb/s up.

<text>Sunapee is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 3,342 at the 2020 census. The town is home to part of Lake Sunapee and includes the village of Georges Mills.

== History ==
Like many other towns, Sunapee went through name changes before its incorporation in 1781, including &quot;Saville&quot; in 1768, &quot;Corey&#x27;s Town&quot;, and then &quot;Wendell&quot;, after John Wendell, a Masonian Proprietor. A village at the western edge of town and a marsh near Sunapee Middle-High School still bear Wendell&#x27;s name. The name &quot;Sunapee&quot; was substituted for &quot;Wendell&quot; by the legislature in 1850. The town, Lake Sunapee and Mount Sunapee share the name which comes from the Algonquian words &quot;suna&quot; meaning &quot;goose&quot;, and &quot;apee&quot;, meaning &quot;water&quot;. The Natives called the area &quot;Lake of the Wild Goose&quot; because it is shaped like a goose, with the beak being in Sunapee Harbor.
Before Sunapee was a sizable tourist attraction, it was an industrial area. One factory produced 110 clothespins a minute. After the factories faded away, the major attraction became the pristine lake, once surrounded by a number of grand hotels. People used large ferries to get from hotel to hotel around the lake, but the ferries were mostly gone by 1915, when the automobile was widely introduced to the area. Lake Sunapee is the only lake in New Hampshire with three working lighthouses, which were originally built in the 1890s by the Woodsum brothers and are currently maintained by the Lake Sunapee Protective Association.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 16.31% of the town. Sunapee is drained by the Sugar River, the outlet of Lake Sunapee and a west-flowing tributary of the Connecticut River. The highest point in town is about above sea level, along the town&#x27;s northern border, just north of Ledge Pond.

<doc id="124946" wikidata="Q2416935" url="?curid=124946" title="Unity, New Hampshire">
<text>Unity is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,518 at the 2020 census, down from 1,671 at the 2010 census. The town includes the villages of Unity, East Unity, Quaker City, and West Unity.

== History ==

Prior to British colonization, the Connecticut River valley was populated by bands of the Western Abenaki, who lived in sometimes-large villages of longhouses. Depending on the season, they would either remain near their villages to fish, gather plants, engage in sugaring, and trade or fight with their neighbors, or head to nearby fowling and hunting grounds. Later, they also farmed tobacco and the &quot;three sisters&quot;: corn, beans, and squash.
Colonization eventually resulted in the establishment of the Province of New Hampshire. Within that province, the area that is now Unity was part of a territory chartered in 1753 and named &quot;Buckingham&quot; after John Hobart, 1st Earl of Buckinghamshire. Grants in the area were given by both the early Massachusetts government and by Governor Benning Wentworth, which led to disputes. The town was incorporated as &quot;Unity&quot; in 1764 after amicable resolutions of the disputes were reached.

In the 1790 census, the town had 538 residents. Unity was on the Second New Hampshire Turnpike, an important trade route chartered in 1799 that connected Amherst, New Hampshire, to Claremont. By 1810, the town had 1,044 inhabitants, with two grain mills, five sawmills, a clothing mill and a distillery. Sheep farming was a principal business.

===2008 presidential politics===
On June 27, 2008, presidential candidate Barack Obama and former rival Hillary Clinton appeared together in Unity at their first public event since Clinton pulled out of the race to be the Democratic presidential candidate. Unity was reportedly chosen because of the town&#x27;s name and because, in the 2008 primary, Obama and Clinton each received 107 votes from Unity citizens.

== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.58% of the town. Unity is entirely within the Connecticut River watershed. The western and central part of town is drained by the Little Sugar River, leading to the Connecticut at North Charlestown, while the northwestern corner and eastern end of the town are drained by tributaries of the Sugar River, which flows to the Connecticut in Claremont. Crescent Lake, lying along the town&#x27;s southern border, is the source of the Cold River, which reaches the Connecticut River at North Walpole.

The highest point in Unity is an unnamed summit along the town&#x27;s northern boundary, with an elevation of above sea level.

<text>Washington is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,192 at the 2020 census. Situated in a hilly, rocky, forested area, and with 26 lakes and ponds, Washington is a picturesque resort area. It is home to Pillsbury State Park.

== History ==

Granted in 1735 by colonial governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts, the town was one of the fort towns designated to protect the colonies from Native attack, named &quot;Monadnock Number 8&quot;. In 1751, the town was granted by Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;New Concord&quot;. As the grant was never settled, the charter was revoked. Reuben Kidder of New Ipswich acquired the grant, naming it &quot;Camden&quot;. The first settlers arrived in 1768 and built log houses. By 1773, the community had 132 inhabitants. On December 13, 1776, the newly established American revolutionary government incorporated the town as &quot;Washington&quot;, after George Washington—one of the first named in his honor.

By 1830, the population had grown to 1,135. Using water power from the streams, mills manufactured lumber, barrel staves, shingles, chair parts, bobbins, whip sockets, hosiery, bricks and washboards. Gristmills ground grain. Sheep farms, producing wool and mutton, were an important business. In 1840, there were 200 farms. Tubbs Union Academy was founded in 1849, and although it did not last long, the school once enrolled over 100 students from New Hampshire and beyond. The first Seventh-day Adventist church was established in Washington in 1862. In 1886, the town produced 53 tons of maple sugar.

The railroad era brought tourists, and hotels were built on the lakes and ponds; however, with 19th-century migration to the Midwest, the town&#x27;s population dwindled. As of 1960, it contained only 162 inhabitants. Washington has since grown, as its scenic environment attracts tourists and retirees. The town contains several examples of early architecture, including the Town Hall, built as a meetinghouse in 1787, the Congregational church built in 1840, and the first Seventh-day Adventist Church built .

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Washington has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 4.16% of the town. The town sits in a highland area atop a watershed divide. The Ashuelot River, part of the Connecticut River watershed, drains the western side of the town, including Ashuelot Pond in the southwest. Bog Brook drains the center of the town from north to south, flowing into Highland Lake near the southern border. The lake is part of the Contoocook River watershed, as are Beards Brook and Woodward Brook on the eastern side of town, and by the Contoocook River are therefore part of the Merrimack River watershed.

Lovewell Mountain, located northeast of the town center and with an elevation of , is the highest point in town. As Edwin A. Charlton writes in &quot;New Hampshire As It Is&quot; (1855), the mountain &quot;received its name from Captain John Lovewell, who was accustomed to ascend it for the purpose of discovering the wigwams of the Indians, and who, on one occasion, killed seven Indians near its summit.&quot; The Washington Town Common, elevation , is the highest town center in the state. (The town hall of Clarksville in northern New Hampshire is located at a higher elevation——but there is no other village development there.)

About 10% of Absecon&#x27;s graduating students have been choosing to attend Pleasantville High School, for which the Absecon district has been paying $18,000 per student each year.

City public school students are also eligible to attend the Atlantic County Institute of Technology in the Mays Landing section of Hamilton Township or the Charter-Tech High School for the Performing Arts, located in Somers Point.

Holy Spirit High School is a Roman Catholic high school, that operates under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Camden. Established in Atlantic City in 1922, the school moved to Absecon in 1964.

<doc id="124949" wikidata="Q616624" url="?curid=124949" title="Brigantine, New Jersey">
<text>Brigantine (or simply The Island) is a city in Atlantic County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 7,716, a decrease of 1,734 (−18.3%) from the 2010 census count of 9,450, which in turn reflected a decline of 3,144 (−25.0%) from the 12,594 counted in the 2000 census. The city, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

What is now the City of Brigantine has passed through a series of names and re-incorporations since it was first created. The area was originally incorporated as Brigantine Beach Borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on June 14, 1890, from portions of Galloway Township, based on the results of a referendum held on June 3, 1890. On April 23, 1897, the area was reincorporated as the City of Brigantine City. This name lasted until April 9, 1914, when it was renamed the City of East Atlantic City. On March 16, 1924, Brigantine was incorporated as a city, replacing East Atlantic City and incorporating further portions of Galloway Township. The borough was named for the many shipwrecks in the area, including those of brigantines.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Brigantine as its 36th best place to live in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey. NJ.com designated Brigantine fourth in its rankings of &quot;The 25 best Jersey Shore towns, ranked&quot; in 2021.

== Geography ==

<text>Buena ( ) is a borough in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough, and all of Atlantic County, is part of South Jersey and the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,501, a decrease of 102 (−2.2%) from the 2010 census count of 4,603, which in turn reflected an increase of 730 (+18.8%) from the 3,873 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Charles K. Landis was a land developer who was the driving force behind the creation of Hammonton and Vineland. Landis also had a hand in establishing other small communities, including Landisville, in Buena Borough. He planned to make it county seat of a new county called Landis County, which would incorporate land from the surrounding counties. However, the locals were against this, and began calling him &quot;King Landis&quot;.

Buena was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 1, 1948, from portions of Buena Vista Township. The borough was reincorporated on May 18, 1949. The borough derives its name from Buena Vista Township, which in turn was named for the 1847 Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican–American War.

In 1979, local resident Madeline Barrale authored a 115-page book illustrating the borough&#x27;s history. Buena Borough celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1999 with the 1st Annual &quot;Buena Day&quot; at Bruno Melini Park. In 2002, the St. Padre Pio Shrine was erected by Italian-American farmers in the Landisville section of Buena and has attracted what was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;steady stream of Catholics&quot; who come to pray at the site.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 7.57 square miles (19.62 km2), including 7.57 square miles (19.61 km2) of land and &lt;0.01 square miles (&lt;0.01 km2) of water (0.01%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include Landisville and Minotola, each of which had postal facilities established with those names in 1871 and 1897, respectively.

The borough borders the municipalities of Buena Vista Township in Atlantic County; Vineland in Cumberland County; and Franklin Township in Gloucester County.

The borough is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. Part of the borough is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Atlantic County, along with areas in Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

Unexpected Road was named the seventh wackiest street name according to a 2006 poll by Car Connection website.

==Government==

===Local government===
Buena Borough is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Buena is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

{the mayor of Buena Borough is Republican Joseph Baruffi, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Buena Borough Council are Council President Douglas Adams (R, 2025), Jorge A. Alvarez (R, 2026), Patricia A. Andaloro (R, 2024), Marina Barsuglia (R, 2025), Frank DeStefano (R, 2026) and Richard Giovinazzi (R, 2024; elected to serve an unexpired term).

Gina Andaloro had switched parties from Democrat to Republican and in January 2023 resigned from her seat expiring in December 2024. The council appointed Republican Richard Giovinazzi to fill her seat, but the council undid the &quot;inadvertent appointment&quot; after realizing that the position should be filled from the same party that elected the individual who resigned. After the council refused to appoint any of the three Democrats nominated, the Democratic municipal committee in March 2023 named Ernest Merighi to fill the vacant seat.

In May 2021, Republican Councilmember Aldo S. Palmieri submitted his resignation from his seat expiring in December 2023, but the council did not accept the resignation until January 2022 at which time it was accepted retroactive to May. In November 222, Joseph Fabrizio was elected to serve the balance of the term.

In July 2019, Joseph D&#x27;Alessandro was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that had been held by Jeffrey Marolda until his resignation from office the precious month.

In October 2016, Jorge Alvarez become Buena&#x27;s first Hispanic councilmember when he was chosen from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2017 that had been held by Robert L. James Jr. until his resignation.

In February 2016, the borough council selected Matthew Walker Sr. from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by Edward Cugini until his resignation; Walker became the first African-American to serve on the borough council.

In 2018, the Buena Borough Police Department was disbanded. The borough entered into a shared service agreement with the Franklin Township Police Department, whose Chief of Police is Brian Zimmer. With the dissolution of Buena&#x27;s police force, the borough&#x27;s officers were being given an opportunity for consideration to be hired by Franklin Township.

<text>Buena Vista Township ( ) is a township located in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 7,033, a decrease of 537 (−7.1%) from the 2010 census count of 7,570, which in turn reflected an increase of 134 (+1.8%) from the 7,436 counted in the 2000 census.

Buena Vista was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 5, 1867, from portions of Hamilton Township. Portions of the township were taken on May 23, 1906, to create Folsom, and on September 1, 1948, to create Buena Borough. The name comes from the 1847 Battle of Buena Vista of the Mexican–American War.

The township is headquarters for Troop A of the New Jersey State Police, which covers more than and 1.7 million residents.
On April 26, 2004, the Buena Vista Township Committee voted to temporarily rename the community of Richland, a section of Buena Vista Township. For the first half of the month of May, Richland became &quot;Mojito, New Jersey&quot;, named after the Cuban rum drink. Bacardi had offered to give the township $5,000 for recreation projects in exchange for a sign placed on U.S. Route 40 commemorating the new name. Richland was chosen because it is home to the family-run Dalponte Farms, a major east coast supplier of mint, an essential ingredient of the mojito.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 41.58 square miles (107.69 km2), including 41.08 square miles (106.39 km2) of land and 0.50 square miles (1.30 km2) of water (1.20%).

Collings Lakes (with a 2010 population of 1,706) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Buena Vista Township.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Buena Acres, East Vineland, Lake Ann, Milmay, New Kuban, Newtonville, Pine Lake Estates and Richland.

The township borders Buena, Folsom, Hamilton Township and Weymouth Township in Atlantic County; Maurice River Township and Vineland in Cumberland County; and both Franklin Township and Monroe Township in Gloucester County.

The township is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. Part of the township is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Atlantic County, along with areas in Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties. 90% of the township&#x27;s area is within the boundaries of the Pine Barrens.

There are no municipalities within New Jersey that have incorporated lands within multiple counties, and by 2010 Cape May County&#x27;s Board of Chosen Freeholders objected to the plan, citing an analysis that the added costs of serving Corbin City would exceed revenues.

<text>Egg Harbor Township is a township in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 47,842, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 4,519 (+10.4%) from the 2010 census count of 43,323, which in turn reflected an increase of 12,597 (+41.0%) from the 30,726 counted in the 2000 census.

Egg Harbor Township was first mentioned as part of Gloucester County in records dating back to March 20, 1693, and at times was called New Weymouth. The township&#x27;s western boundary was established on May 13, 1761, with the area called Great Egg-Harbour Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Galloway Township, which was established by Royal charter on April 4, 1774. Additional portions were taken to form Weymouth Township on February 12, 1798. On February 21, 1798, the area was incorporated as Egg-Harbour Township. Over the ensuing centuries, portions of the township were taken to create many new municipalities: Hamilton Township on February 5, 1813; Atlantic City on May 1, 1854; Absecon on May 1, 1854; South Atlantic City (now Margate City) on September 7, 1885; Pleasantville on January 10, 1889; Linwood on February 20, 1889; Somers Point on April 24, 1886; Longport on March 7, 1898; Ventnor City on March 17, 1903; and Northfield on March 21, 1905. Geographically, the township, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the South Jersey region and of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Great Egg Harbor got its name from Dutch explorer Cornelius Jacobsen Mey. In 1614, Mey came upon the inlet to the Great Egg Harbor River. The meadows were so covered with the eggs of waterfowl and shorebirds that he called it &quot;Eieren Haven&quot; (Egg Harbor).

== History ==
The first residents of what would become Egg Harbor Township were the Lenni Lenape Native Americans, who would spend their summers on the elevated land around the cedar swamp that is now Bargaintown Lake, as well as along the banks of Patcong Creek, where they made use of the abundant fish, shellfish, wild berries, and bird&#x27;s eggs in the area and collected shells that could be carved to make wampum.

Great Egg Harbor was part of Gloucester County, West Jersey. On May 17, 1694 a law was passed that made this official, reading:

The same Act set the legal boundaries of Gloucester County from the Delaware River, along the Burlington County line to the sea and back up the Great Egg Harbor River to the Delaware River. At that time Great Egg Harbor encompassed all of present-day Atlantic County. In 1837, Atlantic County was set apart from Gloucester County and the Townships were Egg Harbor, Galloway, Hamilton and Weymouth.

Since 1837, ten municipalities have separated from the original Egg Harbor Township, including Atlantic City (1854), Absecon (1872), South Atlantic City (1885; now Margate City), Somers Point (1886), Pleasantville (1888), Linwood (1889), Longport (1898), Brigantine (1903), Ventnor City (1903) and Northfield (1905).

In 2017, Egg Harbor township joined Bellmawr, Cranbury, Montclair, and Woodbridge Township as one of the first five municipalities in New Jersey to authorize medical cannabis dispensaries.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 75.47 square miles (195.48 km2), including 67.05 square miles (173.65 km2) of land and 8.43 square miles (21.82 km2) of water (11.16%).

Portions of the township, notably the West Atlantic City and Anchorage Poynte areas, are not contiguous to the main body of the municipality, having been separated from the mainland portion of the township as municipalities were formed, largely since the &quot;boroughitis&quot; phenomenon in the 1890s.

The township is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. Part of the township is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Atlantic County, along with areas in Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

Egg Harbor Township includes the unincorporated communities of Bargaintown (the township&#x27;s seat of government), Cardiff, English Creek, Farmington, Scullville (formerly known as Jeffers), Steelmanville and West Atlantic City, as well as part of McKee City. Other localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Devenshire, English Creek Landing, Greenwood, Idlewood, Jeffers Landing, Jobs Point, Jones Island, McKee City Station, Mount Calvary, Pleasantville Terrace, Pork Island, Rainbow Islands, Sculls Landing, and Seaview Harbor.

The township borders the municipalities of Absecon, Atlantic City, Corbin City, Estell Manor, Galloway Township, Hamilton Township, Linwood, Longport, Margate City, Northfield, Pleasantville, Somers Point, Ventnor City and Weymouth Township in Atlantic County; and Ocean City and Upper Township in Cape May County.

===Parks and protected areas===

There are three wildlife management areas (WMAs) in Egg Harbor Township, two of them in the eastern discontinuous segment of the township. Malibu Beach WMA is located on marshlands between the Great Egg Harbor Bay and Broad Thorofare, covering , and bifurcated by Ocean Drive and NJ 152. It serves as the habitat for several birds, including migratory species in the spring and fall. Known locally as &quot;Dog Beach&quot;, the WMA consists of a back-bay pond, dunes, and one of the only beaches in New Jersey that permits dogs. From the 1930s to the early 2000s, Malibu Beach lost about of sand due to erosion. The Environmental Protection Agency designated the beach as a priority wetland in 1994. From 2002 to 2004, the state Department of Environmental Protection purchased Malibu Beach for $975,000 to make it available to the public, with funding from the Federal Highway Administration related to the NJ 52 causeway replacement project. About of clean sand was dredged from nearby waterways and placed on Malibu Beach. The state also restored the beach&#x27;s wetlands, and removed rubble and invasive plant species. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy severely eroded the beach, as did Winter Storm Jonas in 2015. In 2017, the city of Ocean City began collecting trash from the site, after the Cape May County Bridge Commission ended collection in Fall 2016, and the state considered shutting down the park.

Adjacent to Malibu Beach WMA is Pork Island WMA, which covers of land on four marshy islands between NJ 152 and Margate Blvd, and between Absecon Island and the mainland. It is inaccessible by car. In the southern part of Egg Harbor Township are scattered plots of wetland near the Great Egg Harbor River that consist of about , or 5.9%, of the Lester G. MacNamara WMA, previously known as Tuckahoe WMA. Established in 1933, the WMA is the oldest in the state, and spreads across four municipalities in Atlantic and Cape May counties.

===Development and the Pine Barrens===
Egg Harbor Township (along with Hamilton and Galloway Townships) were designated as Regional Growth Areas&quot; by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission resulting in increased residential development. In exchange for the development in Egg Harbor Township, no trees are demolished for housing and other buildings in the Pine Barrens, also known as the Pinelands. The &quot;Regional Growth Area&quot; designation was, and remains, tantamount to a state mandate to construct +/− 30,000 additional housing units in Egg Harbor Township. Neighboring communities, Galloway Township (to the north) and Hamilton Township (to the West) were also designated as &quot;Growth Areas&quot; by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission.

In January 2007, the Egg Harbor Township Planning Board issued site approval for 667 new homes (and a new fire station) in the Farmington section of Egg Harbor Township. The &quot;Village at Farmington&quot; will be developed by PulteGroup and is proposed to include 140 townhouses, 261 planned adult homes (55 and older) and 259 single family detached dwellings, as well as a community clubhouse, a second club house for 55 and older, recreation fields and walking paths to be constructed on a site covering . PulteGroup will pay over $800,000 to the Egg Harbor Township recreation fund because the club houses and paths do not satisfy the township&#x27;s recreation requirements for a development of this size and, as part of the approval, PulteGroup will also contribute $350,000 toward the construction of a new Farmington Fire Station with the landowners, Schoffer Enterprises, donating the land.
Once approvals are complete, PulteGroup will build 60 units of each type per year until the project is complete, offering single family homes in the mid $300,000&#x27;s and the adult homes for $250,000.

The Planning Board has requested that paperwork presented to the homeowners at purchase will &quot;fully disclose&quot; to prospective purchasers that there exists a nearby airport (Atlantic City International Airport, which, in addition to functioning as a full service airport, is home to the 177th wing of the Air National Guard, the FAA Technical Center, a Homeland Security Department Training Center as well as the Atlantic City base of Operations for the United States Coast Guard), meaning they will be in the proximity of the approach and takeoff patterns for both incoming and outgoing aircraft, the Atlantic County Municipal Utility Authority (ACMUA), where all local municipalities bring their trash and recycle. The disclosure will inform prospective buyers that, from time to time, the ACMUA Facility is odoriferous and that a training/shooting range is part of the military/industrial portion of the Airport.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===
The Township of Egg Harbor is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state. The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle.

<text>Egg Harbor City is a city in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The city, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 4,396, an increase of 153 (+3.6%) from the 2010 census count of 4,243, which in turn reflected a decline of 302 (−6.6%) from the 4,545 counted in the 2000 census.

The city had the seventh-highest property tax rate in New Jersey, with an equalized rate of 5.044% in 2020, compared to 2.560% in the county as a whole and a statewide average of 2.279%.

==History==
The area home to Egg Harbor City was settled by Europeans in 1614, when the Dutch vessel &quot;Fortuyn&quot; landed at the Mullica River. The first settlers named the area &quot;Eyren Haven&quot; after the large number of gull eggs in the area.

In 1854, the Camden and Atlantic Railroad opened. On December 14, 1854, a group of prominent German Americans from Philadelphia, including William and Henry Schmoele and Philip Mathias Wolsieffer, incorporated the &quot;Gloucester Farm and Town Association&quot;, which purchased approximately 38,000 acres of woodland north of the railroad to serve as a refuge for those being persecuted in the anti-immigrant violence known as the Know-Nothing movement. The corporation planned two cities: a four-square-mile city called &quot;Pomona&quot; closest to the railroad, and another city called &quot;Gloucester&quot; to the north. However, the twin city scheme was dropped in favor of one seven-mile-long metropolis called &quot;Egg Harbor City&quot;. The development&#x27;s layout contained an urban &quot;city core&quot; containing 100x150-foot lots bounded by New York Avenue to the west and Baltimore Avenue to the east, while the remainder of the land was divided into separate 20-acre farm parcels. The corporation issued stocks at $300 per share; with each share, stockholders would acquire one residential building lot and one farm parcel. The city was marketed heavily in cities containing large German American populations, including Baltimore, Buffalo, Cleveland, Milwaukee, and St. Louis.

The land was divided and plotted from the railroad north to the Mullica River, west ending at Hanover Avenue, and the easternmost land being the home of the present-day Stockton University. The north-south streets were named for cities with large German populations, while the east-west streets were named for notable Germans, starting with Agassiz Avenue (current-day White Horse Pike) to the south, and Zschokke Avenue to the north. The city was planned to include ample public green space; both New York Avenue and Baltimore Avenue were platted with wide medians to accommodate garden plats, Landing Creek would have been dammed to create an artificial lake called &quot;Gloucester Lake&quot;, and Egg Harbor City Lake would have been made into a reservoir at the center of a large urban park containing landscaped gardens, an arboretum, and a model farm. The Mullica River was proposed to be made navigable for commercial vessels, and the northern edge of the street grid along the river was to contain canals and wharfs for ships to dock.

Egg Harbor City was officially incorporated as a city by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on June 14, 1858, from portions of Galloway Township and Mullica Township. The city was reincorporated on February 13, 1868. The city&#x27;s growth was slowed due to an economic crisis in 1857, and then further during the Civil War. Though the city did not grow to the size as originally proposed, it grew in population steadily in the 1870s, and remained a virtual island of German language and culture in South Jersey for more than 50 years.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 11.42 square miles (29.58 km2), including 10.85 square miles (28.10 km2) of land and 0.57 square miles (1.48 km2) of water (4.99%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Clarks Landing, Gloucester Furnace and Gloucester Lake.

The city borders the municipalities of Galloway Township and Mullica Township in Atlantic County; and Washington Township in Burlington County.

The city is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. All of the city is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Atlantic County, along with areas in Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

<doc id="124960" wikidata="Q363310" url="?curid=124960" title="Galloway Township, New Jersey">
<text>Galloway Township is a township in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and a growing edge city to neighboring Atlantic City. At of total area of land and water, Galloway Township is the largest municipality in the state. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 37,813, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 464 (+1.2%) from the 2010 census count of 37,349, which in turn reflected an increase of 6,140 (+19.7%) from the 31,209 counted in the 2000 census.

Galloway Township was incorporated by Royal charter on April 4, 1774, from portions of Egg Harbor Township, when it was still part of Gloucester County. Galloway was incorporated as one of the initial group of 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. After becoming part of the newly formed Atlantic County in 1837, portions of the township were taken to create Mullica Township (March 13, 1838), Egg Harbor City (June 14, 1858), Absecon (February 29, 1872), Brigantine Beach borough (now Brigantine; June 14, 1890) and Port Republic (March 1, 1905).

Geographically, the township, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the South Jersey region of the state and of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

==History==
The Township of Galloway was created by Royal Patent of King George III of Great Britain on April 4, 1774. At that time it was part of Gloucester County, and comprised what is now Hammonton, Mullica Township, Egg Harbor City, Port Republic, Brigantine, Atlantic City, and the northern portion of Absecon. Galloway Township was incorporated by the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as one of the state&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships under the Township Act of 1798.

For thousands of years, the area of Galloway Township was occupied by different cultures of indigenous peoples. The Lenape Native Americans were the historic tribe who occupied the area at the time of European encounter. They were one of the many Algonguian language peoples of the East Coast.

They were followed by European settlers, primarily English in the early years of colonial settlement. Historians are uncertain of the source of Galloway Township&#x27;s name. One theory is that it was named after an area known as Galloway now part of the modern region of Dumfries and Galloway in southern Scotland. An alternative derivation is that the Township was named for Joseph Galloway, a Loyalist delegate to the First Continental Congress in 1774, who was opposed to independence of the Thirteen Colonies. During the American Revolutionary War, Galloway was the site of the Battle of Chestnut Neck, in what is now a part of Port Republic.

During the spring of 2007, a large swath of oak and other hardwood trees were defoliated by the Gypsy moth caterpillar. Due to budget constraints, the township did not apply for spraying through the State of New Jersey, and the gypsy moths flourished.

On the morning of August 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene made its second U.S. landfall in Brigantine, though initial reports placed it at the Little Egg Inlet on the border with Little Egg Harbor Township. At the time it was believed to be the first hurricane to make landfall in New Jersey since 1903, but later analysis by the National Hurricane Center determined that the storm had weakened to tropical storm status by the time it made its second landfall.

==Geography==

Opened in 1997 among the state&#x27;s first group of charter schools, the school&#x27;s charter was revoked due to low scores on standardized tests and the school closed at the end of the 2014–2015 school year.

Assumption Regional Catholic School is a Catholic elementary school for pre-kindergarten through eighth grades with a specially designed middle school system, operated under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Camden and serving students from the sending parishes of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish (in Galloway Township), St. Thomas the Apostle Church (Brigantine) and St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Parish (Absecon). The school had been located in Pomona, and moved in September 2007 to another campus elsewhere in the township.

Stockton University is a four-year liberal arts university located in the Pomona section of the township.

Galloway Township is served by Atlantic Cape Community College, a public community college in Atlantic and Cape May counties, with more than 8,000 students enrolled. Its main campuses are in the Mays Landing section of Hamilton Township, Atlantic City, and Cape May Court House.

<text>Hamilton Township is a township in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 27,484, an increase of 981 (+3.7%) from the 2010 census count of 26,503, which in turn reflected an increase of 6,004 (+29.3%) from the 20,499 counted in the 2000 census. The Township of Hamilton was incorporated by the New Jersey Legislature on February 5, 1813.

The township calls itself &quot;New Jersey&#x27;s Largest Municipality&quot; on its stationery and its website. At , Hamilton Township has the largest land area of any municipality in New Jersey. However, with a total area (land and water combined) of it is the second-largest municipality in New Jersey, behind neighboring Galloway Township, which has a total area of .

Geographically, the township, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the South Jersey region of the state and of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

==History==
Hamilton Township&#x27;s origins are directly tied to the Great Egg Harbor River and its tributaries which run through it. George May, after whom the village of Mays Landing was named, built a shipyard and trading post near Babcock Creek in 1756. By the mid 19th century, Mays Landing reached the height of its shipbuilding.

From 1830 to 1880, more than 200 vessels were built along the Great Egg Harbor River with lumber from native forests and iron from Weymouth foundries. Half of them were produced at Mays Landing. But by the end of the century, wood shipbuilding began to disappear due to the lack of suitable timber. Iron was then substituted for hull construction.

Hamilton was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 5, 1813, from portions of Egg Harbor Township and Weymouth Township, while the area was still part of Gloucester County. Hamilton became part of the newly created Atlantic County in 1837. Portions of the township were taken to form Hammonton on March 5, 1866, and to form Buena Vista Township on March 5, 1867. The township was named for Alexander Hamilton.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 112.94 square miles (292.52 km2), including 110.90 square miles (287.22 km2) of land and 2.05 square miles (5.31 km2) of water (1.81%).

Mays Landing, with a 2010 population of 2,135, is a census-designated place located within Hamilton Township that has been the county seat of Atlantic County since it was formed in 1837.

Other unincorporated communities, localities, and places located partially or completely within the township include Mays Landing, the county seat of Atlantic County, and Bears Head, Carmantown, Catawba, Clarktown, Cologne, Dacosta, Emmelsville, Gravelly Run, Lake Lenape, Laureldale, McKee City, Mizpah, Reega, Thompsontown, Weymouth, and Wilsons Landing.

The township borders the Atlantic County municipalities of Buena Vista Township, Egg Harbor Township, Estell Manor, Folsom, Galloway Township, Hammonton, Mullica Township and Weymouth Township.

===Pinelands Reserve===
The township is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. Part of the township is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Atlantic County, along with areas in Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

The western three-quarters of the township is governed by regulation by the New Jersey Pinelands Commission, which places major limitations on development in that portion of the township, which remains as pine forest with a distinctly rural character, with other portions designated as a Rural Development Area. Significant portions of the eastern quarter of the township are designated by the Pinelands Commission as part of the Regional Growth Area (RGA), in which development is &quot;allowed and encouraged&quot; in the area surrounding Atlantic City, New Jersey. The majority of the township&#x27;s residents live in the area covered by the RGA, which has been developed in suburban fashion and includes shopping areas such as the Hamilton Mall, part of the township&#x27;s of first class commercial retail properties.

<text>Hammonton is a town in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, that has been referred to as the &quot;Blueberry Capital of the World&quot;. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 14,711, a decrease of 80 (−0.5%) from the 2010 census count of 14,791, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,187 (+17.4%) from the 12,604 counted in the 2000 census. Geographically, the town, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the South Jersey region of the state and of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

The first European settlement of Hammonton was in 1812. It was named for John Hammond Coffin, a son of one of the community&#x27;s earliest settlers, William Coffin, with the &quot;d&quot; in what was originally Hammondton disappearing over time. It was incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 5, 1866, from portions of Hamilton Township and Mullica Township.

The town is located directly between Philadelphia and the resort town of Atlantic City, along a former route of the Pennsylvania Railroad with Hammonton station directly in the downtown area. The route is now used by NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line.

==History==
Little is known about the area of Hammonton prior to European contact. Archaeological evidence, including stone tools likely dating back to the Woodland period, suggests some form of prehistoric habitation, though the details remain unclear. At the time of European contact, the region was inhabited by the Unalachtigo Lenape people.

As European settlement progressed, the Lenape population in the area declined due to disease, loss of land to European settlers, and emigration. In 1748, the West Jersey Society was granted rights over a large tract of land within the English Province of New Jersey, which included the territory that would later become Hammonton. In 1805, the Society sold a parcel of what would eventually become Hammonton, with the land passing through several owners.

In 1812, William Coffin and his family migrated to the area, building a home and managing a sawmill for John R. Coates. Coffin purchased the land and the mill in 1814. The sawmill was situated adjacent to Hammonton Lake and extended north and east of the present-day town, rather than being located within the current downtown. Originally named &quot;Hammondton&quot; after Coffin&#x27;s son, John Hammond Coffin, the name was later simplified to Hammonton.

In 1817, Coffin established a glass factory in the area, taking advantage of the abundance of cheap timber and bog iron that supported South Jersey&#x27;s glass industry at the time. Finished products were transported via the Mullica River before the advent of railroads, with trading stores and workers&#x27; housing established nearby.

The early settlement of Old Hammonton was small and experienced a shift from glass production to farming, particularly the cultivation of strawberries and blueberries. The arrival of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad in 1854, which ran to the west of Old Hammonton, prompted further development. In 1856, developer Charles K. Landis and Philadelphia banker Richard Byrnes formed Landis &amp; Byrnes, acquiring large plots of land near the newly constructed railroad. They promoted and sold smaller parcels for development, moving the settlement closer to the railway. The Hammonton Railroad Station was established in 1858.

In 1861, Landis and Byrnes had a falling-out; Byrnes remained in Hammonton, while Landis went on to establish Vineland and Sea Isle City. In 1866, Hammonton&#x27;s leaders petitioned the New Jersey Legislature to separate from Mullica Township and Hamilton Township, and Hammonton was officially incorporated as a town on March 5, 1866. At the time of incorporation, the population was recorded as 1,422.

A significant development in Hammonton&#x27;s history following incorporation was a wave of Italian immigration. Salvador Calabrasce, an Italian immigrant and former Union Navy serviceman, moved to Hammonton after marrying a New Jersey native. He corresponded with friends in Gesso,Sicily, which attracted more immigrants to Hammonton. Through the efforts of Calabrasce and others, the town saw a growing population of Italian-Americans, who would eventually make up a substantial portion of the town&#x27;s overall population.

Hammonton briefly featured a major racing track, the Atlantic City Speedway. Races were held from 1926 to 1928 on the wooden track that was built, complete with a direct rail connection. The owners had hoped to compete with the major racetracks of the era, but were unable to continue. The track served as a test track for Studebaker from 1928 to 1933 before it was demolished, and the timber used in its construction was repurposed for other buildings.

The first Hammonton Blueberry Festival was held in 1953, embracing the area&#x27;s identity as a major producer of blueberries.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hammonton had a total area of 41.32 square miles (107.01 km2), including 40.75 square miles (105.54 km2) of land and 0.57 square miles (1.46 km2) of water (1.37%).

The town borders Folsom borough, to the southwest, and both Hamilton and Mullica townships to the southeast in Atlantic County; Shamong Township and Washington Township in Burlington County to the northeast; and Waterford Township and Winslow Township in Camden County to the northwest. It is located in the Atlantic Coastal Plain, so is largely flat, though the highest point in Atlantic County is located along the Pennsylvania Railroad within the borders of Hammonton. The town is located almost exactly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located completely or partially within the town include Barnard, Bellhurst, Caldwell Crossing, Dacosta, Dutchtown, Great Swamp, Murphy, Rockford, Rockwood, Rosedale and West Mills.

===Pine Barrens===
The town is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. All of the town is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Atlantic County, along with areas in Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

Due to its location in the Pine Barrens, the soil is largely sandy, making it ideal for growing blueberries. Low, marshy areas, often within the Pine Barrens are also used for cranberry cultivation.

On June 19, 2022, a fire broke out in the Wharton State Forest in a remote area in the northern part of Hammonton. The Mullica River Fire consumed more than 15,000 acres of protected land and became the largest wildfire in the state in 15 years. The cause of the fire is believed to be caused by an illegal campfire.

===Climate===
Hammonton lies in the northern reaches of the humid subtropical climate zone, and, similar to inland southern New Jersey, is characterized by brisk winters, hot summers, and plentiful precipitation spread evenly throughout the year. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Hammonton&#x27;s climate is abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Arts and culture==
Musical groups from the town include the rock band The Early November.

==Sports==
In 1997, Gabriel Donio (founder and publisher of &quot;The Hammonton Gazette&quot;) proposed a minor-league baseball team called the Hammonton Blueberries, going so far as to create a team logo and a prototype uniform, as well as purchasing a 20-acre tract of land for $200,000. Donio planned to build on the site a 3,500-seat, six-million-dollar ballpark, which he described as &quot;a rough miniature of the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; Ebbets Field&quot;. In 1999, the Northern League announced that they would form a six-team developmental circuit and include Hammonton as one of the clubs; however, this did not happen, and the proposed ballpark was not built, putting an end to the Blueberries. (Since Hammonton is less than 75 miles from Philadelphia, any pro baseball team there would either need permission from the Phillies or play in an independent league, outside of MLB&#x27;s jurisdiction.)

==Government==

===Local government===
Hammonton is governed under the Town form of New Jersey municipal government. The town is one of nine municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this traditional form of government. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the Town Council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The Mayor is elected to a four-year term. The Town Council includes six members elected to serve two-year terms on a staggered basis, with three seats coming up for election each year.

, the Mayor of Hammonton is Independent Steve DiDonato, whose term of office ends December 31, 2025. Members of the Hammonton Town Council are Deputy Mayor Tom Gribbin (I, 2023), Steven Furgione (I, 2024), Jonathan Oliva (I, 2023), Renee Rodio (R, 2024), Sam Rodio (I, 2024) and Ed Wuillermin (I, 2023).

<text>Linwood is a city in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 6,971, a decrease of 121 (−1.7%) from the 2010 census count of 7,092, which in turn reflected a decline of 80 (−1.1%) from the 7,172 counted in the 2000 census.

Linwood was originally incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 20, 1889, from portions of Egg Harbor Township, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day. Linwood was reincorporated as a city on April 27, 1931. The area had been called Leedsville until 1880, when a post office was being established. The United States Postal Service insisted that the name had to be changed as it conflicted with an existing post office elsewhere in the state. Among the names proposed and considered by local residents were &quot;Brinola&quot;, &quot;Geneva&quot;, &quot;Pearville&quot; and &quot;Viola&quot;, with &quot;Linwood&quot; ultimately chosen.

Geographically, the city, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the South Jersey region of the state and of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

<text>Longport is a borough situated on the Jersey Shore on Absecon Island, within Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, on the Atlantic Ocean shoreline. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 893, a decrease of two people (−0.2%) from the 2010 census count of 895, which in turn reflected a decline of 159 (−15.1%) from the 1,054 counted in the 2000 census.

Geographically, the city, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the South Jersey region of the state and of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

==History==

James Long, an absentee owner, purchased a parcel in 1857 that grew over the years as sand accumulated and as additional property was purchased. Acquired by M. Simpson McCullough in 1882, the community was named Longport in honor of Long.

Longport was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 7, 1898, from portions of Egg Harbor Township.

In 2014, residents of Seaview Harbor, located across Beach Thorofare, submitted a petition to join neighboring Longport, citing lack of access to the rest of Egg Harbor Township and high taxes.

==Education==
For kindergarten through eighth grade, public school students from Longport attend the Margate City Schools in Margate City as part of a sending/receiving relationship. Longport is a non-operating school district that had 49 students in the Margate district and 8 in Atlantic City for high school as of 2010, operating with a three-member board of education that oversaw its relationships with its sending districts. As of the 2018–19 school year, the district, comprised of two schools, had an enrollment of 351 students and 48.8 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 7.2:1. Schools in the district (with 2018–19 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
William H. Ross III Elementary School 169 students in grades K–4 and 
Eugene A. Tighe Middle School with 181 students in grades 5–8.

Starting in the 2014–15 school year, public school students from Longport in grades 9–12 attend Ocean City High School as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Ocean City School District; the Longport district, which is closer to Ocean City and would save significantly on tuition costs per student, received permission from the New Jersey Department of Education to end the relationship with Atlantic City. As of the 2018–19 school year, Ocean City High School had an enrollment of 1,245 students and 98.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.6:1.

Through the 2013–14 school year, Longport&#x27;s students had attended Atlantic City High School, along with those from Brigantine, Margate City and Ventnor City, as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Atlantic City School District. The Longport Board of Education had investigated the possibility of offering city students the option of attending either Atlantic City High School or Ocean City High School, as part of an effort to control the costs for the average of ten Longport students sent to attend public high school annually. With the Atlantic City district charging tuition estimated at nearly $24,000 per student as of 2013–2014 and the Ocean City School District charging 25% less per student, district officials estimated prospective savings of $128,000 in the first five years, though those savings could disappear if more of the nearly two-thirds of students attending private high schools were to shift to choose the new Ocean City option. In June 2014, the Acting State Commissioner of Education approved the end of the relationship with the Atlantic City district under which Longport&#x27;s students could start attending Ocean City High School starting with the 2014–2015 school year.

Borough public school students are also eligible to attend the Atlantic County Institute of Technology in the Mays Landing section of Hamilton Township or the Charter-Tech High School for the Performing Arts, located in Somers Point.

<text>Margate City is a city situated on the Jersey Shore on Absecon Island, within Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, on the Atlantic Ocean shoreline. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 5,317, a decrease of 1,037 (−16.3%) from the 2010 census count of 6,354, which in turn had reflected a decline of 1,839 (−22.4%) from the 8,193 counted in the 2000 census. Geographically, the city, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the South Jersey region of the state and of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Margate City was originally incorporated as the borough of South Atlantic City by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 7, 1885, from portions of Egg Harbor Township, based on the results of a referendum held on August 1, 1885. South Atlantic City was reincorporated as a city on April 23, 1897, and then reincorporated with the name Margate City on April 20, 1909. The city was named for Margate in Kent, England.

The city is located on Absecon Island, which stretches for and is also home of Atlantic City and Ventnor City to the northeast, and Longport on the southwest. The city stretches about eight blocks from the Atlantic Ocean to the bay at most points in town. Margate is a popular Jersey Shore destination, especially during the summer, and is the home of Lucy the Elephant, a -tall wooden and metal-clad elephant recognized as America’s Oldest Surviving Roadside Attraction and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and of Marven Gardens, of &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game fame.

==Parks and recreation==

===Summer residency===

Along with other spots on the Jersey Shore, Margate becomes a popular destination in the summer months. Many houses in Margate are second homes used during the summer, and a considerable number are owned by year-round residents. Unlike in other places, such as Cape May or Ocean City, where many visitors spend a few nights in a hotel, Margate has no hotels, so most of the people who choose this town are regulars. Unlike other area towns such as Ocean City and the municipalities on Long Beach Island, weekly house/condominium rentals are almost non-existent in Margate.

===Beaches===
Margate&#x27;s beaches attract surfers, kayaking, and hobie cat sailing.

The Margate beaches are narrower than beaches at many other places at the Jersey Shore. There are few dunes and those that do exist are artificial, having been created to protect beaches from nor&#x27;easters and hurricanes. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, Margate voters will consider a referendum that would allow the city to participate in a program operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under which dunes would be constructed on the city&#x27;s beaches, which would be intended to alleviate beach erosion and provide storm protection to Margate and to adjoining Ventnor City, which has already had a beach protection program in place for the past ten years, under which dunes have already been constructed.

Margate City Beach Patrol operates lifeguard stands and beach patrol operations for the Margate beaches. Lifeguards are on duty during summer months from 10 am to 6 pm, with more limited hours in the late Spring and early Autumn months.

Margate beaches are not free beaches. Beachgoers must purchase a seasonal or weekly tag to enjoy the beach. Seasonal badges can be purchased preseason at a reduced rate. Veterans and active military members are offered free seasonal badges.

===Marinas and fishing===
Margate is host to many bayside docks providing the casual fisherman hours of enjoyment and relaxation. Local charter boats offer sport and deep sea fishing. Margate&#x27;s many marinas offer docks for lease, equipment rentals, fuel stations and fishing charters.

===Attractions===

Margate is the home of Lucy the Elephant, the &quot;largest elephant in the world&quot; and is the oldest remaining example of zoomorphic architecture left in the United States.

<text>Mullica Township is a township in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 5,816, a decrease of 331 (−5.4%) from the 2010 census count of 6,147, which in turn reflected an increase of 235 (+4.0%) from the 5,912 counted in the 2000 census. Geographically, the township, and all of Atlantic County, is part of the South Jersey region of the state and of the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan statistical area, which in turn is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden combined statistical area and the Delaware Valley.

Mullica Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 13, 1838, from the western section of Galloway Township. Egg Harbor City was created from portions of the township on June 14, 1858, while the Town of Hammonton was created and split off on March 5, 1866.

The township and its river were named after Eric Pålsson Mullica, early Swedish settler (with Finnish ancestry) born in 1636 who founded a homestead on the river after moving there from the vicinity of Philadelphia, and who later moved to Mullica Hill in Gloucester County. When used as a common noun, &quot;&quot; is the Finnish term for a bull calf.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 56.84 square miles (147.22 km2), including 56.38 square miles (146.01 km2) of land and 0.47 square miles (1.21 km2) of water (0.82%).

Despite a relatively small population, Mullica Township comprises many small communities. Elwood is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) (with a 2010 Census population of 1,437) located within Mullica Township.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Amatol, Colwell, Da Costa, Devonshire, East Hammonton, Indian Cabin, Nesco, New Columbia, Pleasant Mills, Speedway, Sweetwater, Weekstown, Wescoatville, West Egg Harbor and Woodland. Unincorporated communities in Mullica Township are largely identified by landmarks such as the Elwood Deli, the Sweetwater Casino, or the Weekstown Firehouse. The small unincorporated communities within the township engender a particularly high level of pride, and many Mullica Township residents refer to themselves as residents of their unincorporated community, before referring to themselves as residents of Mullica Township.

The township is located in the northwest portion of Atlantic County. It is bounded on the north by Washington Township in Burlington County (which is separated from it by the Mullica River); on the east by Egg Harbor City; on the south by Galloway Township and Hamilton Township; and on the west by the Town of Hammonton. The Township is approximately outside of Atlantic City and outside of Philadelphia.

The township is one of 56 South Jersey municipalities that are included within the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, a protected natural area of unique ecology covering , that has been classified as a United States Biosphere Reserve and established by Congress in 1978 as the nation&#x27;s first National Reserve. All of the township is included in the state-designated Pinelands Area, which includes portions of Atlantic County, along with areas in Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester and Ocean counties.

The governing body is comprised of three Commissioners who are elected at-large to serve four-year terms on a concurrent basis in non-partisan elections held as part of the May municipal election. After each election, the three elected commissioners are each assigned a department to oversee and choose one of their members to serve as Mayor.

===Local government===

Allendale is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Allendale is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council.

==Media==

Alpine is home to the tower and laboratory built by Edwin Howard Armstrong after RCA evicted him from the Empire State Building. Armstrong&#x27;s experimental FM station, W2XMN, used various frequencies to broadcast from the tower, first on 42.8 MHz; later on 44.1 MHz; and finally on 93.1 MHz in the modern FM band. The laboratory building and the tower still stand; the 400-foot (122-m) tower is home to many two-way radio users, one modern FM station (Fairleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s WFDU), and backup transmitters for several of New York&#x27;s television stations. The tower served as a primary tower for the stations after the September 11 terrorist attacks destroyed the World Trade Center.

There was some local opposition to this scheme, but the move was temporary, as the stations affected moved their primary broadcast facilities to the Empire State Building. The original lab building is home to a static display of historic communications equipment and offices; the USA Network cable channel operated from this building in the late 1970s.

==Points of interest==
Rio Vista is an upscale neighborhood in the southern section of Alpine. Rio Vista is home to Devil&#x27;s Tower, a stone water tower that is claimed to be haunted. It was originally designed by Charles Rollinson Lamb for sugar baron Manuel Rionda (1854–1943) in order to allow his wife to see New York from the New Jersey side of the Hudson River. The legend has it that when his wife saw him with another woman, she committed suicide by jumping off the tower.

After becoming upset over his wife&#x27;s death, Rionda stopped all work on the tower. In reality Harriet Rionda died of natural causes in 1922 and was interred nearby for approximately 20 years. Her coffin was moved to Brookside Cemetery, Englewood. The estate was later sub-divided into 197 housing sites consisting of miles of roadway, infrastructure, and related facilities in the mid-1980s.

The New Jersey Section of the Palisades Interstate Park runs the length of Alpine along the top of the New Jersey Palisades and along the Hudson River. The Alpine Boat Basin serves as both a public picnic area and small marina for private boats. The area is a scenic riverfront picnic area and boat basin, plus beach for car-top boat launches (canoe and kayak), with fishing, access to hiking trails and Henry Hudson Drive, restrooms, water, vending machines, and public phones. Alpine Pavilion, an open-air stone picnic pavilion built in 1934 by the Civil Works Administration and available for rental is located here, as well as the historic Blackledge-Kearney House, said to be the site where Lord Cornwallis and his troops landed on November 20, 1776, in their pursuit of the Continental Army following the rout of George Washington&#x27;s forces in the Battle of New York.

<text>Bogota is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,778, an increase of 591 (+7.2%) from the 2010 census count of 8,187, which in turn reflected a decline of 62 (−0.8%) from the 8,249 counted in the 2000 census.

Bogota was formed on November 14, 1894, from portions of Ridgefield Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The borough was formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed during 1894 alone. Portions of Bogota were taken in 1895 to form part of the newly created Township of Teaneck. Bogota was named in honor of the Bogert family, which had been the first European settlers to occupy the area, and may also be a blend of Bogert and Banta, another early family, with an &quot;O&quot; added to ease pronunciation.

The borough&#x27;s name is pronounced , unlike Bogotá, capital city of Colombia, which is accented on the final syllable.

==Geography==

The borough borders Hackensack to the west, Ridgefield Park to the south and Teaneck on the north and east.

Bogota is bisected by the CSX River Line, which divides the borough into an eastern and western portion. The eastern half is highly industrial, with more busy roads. The western half is mainly suburban, with the exception of storefronts on West Main Street, River Road, and a development on West Fort Lee Road.

==Government==

===Local government===
Bogota is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Bogota is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body, with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of the Borough of Bogota is Republican Daniele Fede, serving a term of office that expires on December 31, 2027. Members of the Bogota Borough Council are Council President Consuelo M. Carpenter (D, 2024), Lisa Kohles (D, 2026), Patrick H. McHale (D, 2025), John G. Mitchell (D, 2025), Mary Ellen Murphy (D, 2023), Robert Robbins (D, 2024) and Diana Vergara (D, 2026).

Kathryn Gates-Ferris was appointed in late 2015 to fill the seat vacated by Lisa Kohles.

The council seat expiring in 2015 held by Chris Kelemen was vacated when he took office as mayor in January 2015.

Citing the bitter political differences in the governing body and the loss of two council seats to Republican challengers in the general election that month, Mayor Patrick McHale resigned from office in November 2013 and was replaced on an acting basis by Council President Tito Jackson, who served in that role until the November 2014 election. In September 2011, the borough council appointed Wanda Uceta to fill the vacant seat of Joseph Nooto who had died earlier that month. In December 2013, Lisa Kohles was chosen to fill Jackson&#x27;s vacant council seat for a term ending in December 2014.

In 2012, Democrats retained full control of borough government, as incumbent Jorge Nunez won re-election along with his running mate Robert Robbins, who won his first term in office.

In the November 2011 general election, Democrats gained control of all of the borough&#x27;s elected positions. Patrick McHale was re-elected to a four-year term as mayor. Incumbents Michael Brophy and Tito Jackson were elected to new three-year terms, while Wanda Uceta won a two-year unexpired term and Evaristo Burdiez Jr. won his first full three-year term, after both Burdiez and Uceta had been appointed to fill vacancies.

In the 2010 General Election, Councilmen Joseph Noto and Michael Brophy won reelection, while first-time candidate Arthur Konigsberg also captured a seat. They defeated Councilwoman Anne Marie Mitchell and challengers Jared Geist and Guillermo Martinez. Brophy led the way with 1,235 votes, followed by Noto with 1,072 and Konigsberg with 1,060. Mitchell received 966 votes, while Geist and Martinez earned 847 and 775 votes, respectively. Noto and Konigsberg won three-year terms, while Brophy—who was appointed to fill a vacancy last year—will serve for an additional year to finish the uncompleted term.

In July 2006, then-Mayor Lonegan created a controversy when he engineered a borough council resolution requesting the removal of a Spanish-language billboard in the borough that was advertising McDonald&#x27;s iced coffee. Lonegan said the billboard was &quot;divisive.&quot; The story received national publicity, occurring concurrently with a national debate on illegal immigration. The 2003 mayoral election won by Lonegan was the subject of the documentary &quot;Anytown, USA&quot;.

The borough was named for its location as a &quot;Park by the Cliffs&quot;.

U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg resided in the borough until his death in 2013. Cliffside Park was home to the former Palisades Amusement Park, part of which was located in adjoining Fort Lee.
