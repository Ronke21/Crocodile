<text>Greenfield is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,716 at the 2020 census. Greenfield is home to the Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center, to Greenfield State Park, and to part of the Wapack Trail.

== History ==

Originally known as &quot;Lyndeborough Addition&quot;, the area was first settled by the Lynde family in 1753. Separated from the nearest church and school by the Monadnock hills, the residents successfully petitioned to form a new town in 1791, using the name &quot;Greenfield&quot; to highlight the area&#x27;s level, fertile ground.

In 1953, the Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center began operation in Greenfield. Established by Harry Gregg, the facility on Crotched Mountain originally treated for polio, cerebral palsy, spina bifida and other physical and neurological disabilities. A center for adult rehabilitation opened in 1961, and a rehabilitation center for adults with brain injuries in 1986. The complex today provides service to over 2,000 children and adults. In 2004, it unveiled the first wheelchair-accessible tree house in New Hampshire.

Greenfield is home to the Yankee Siege, considered the most powerful (current) trebuchet in the world, which has participated in the annual World Championship Punkin&#x27; Chunkin&#x27; Contest in Sussex County, Delaware, since 2004. The farthest official toss is as of 2008, although there are unofficial reports of throws as of 2009.

== History ==

=== Town name ===
According to Samuel T. Worcester&#x27;s history which was commissioned by the town selectmen in 1878, the town was incorporated in the province of New Hampshire on April 3, 1746, &quot;to have continence forever by the name of &quot;Holles&quot;...&quot;

Worcester argues that, at the time of the charter, Governor Benning Wentworth was indebted to Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, for his appointment as governor. According to Worcester, it was &quot;very much the custom with Gov. Wentworth&quot; to name towns in honor of his friends and patrons. Thus in the same year, the towns of Pelham and Holles were incorporated, and named after the duke. Worcester cites a Mr. Bancroft who,

:: &quot;...in his history, says of him (Newcastle) that he was of so feeble a head, and so treacherous a heart that Sir Robert Walpole called his name &#x27;Perfidy&#x27;; that Lord Halifax used to revile him as a knave and fool, and that he was so ignorant of this continent, that it was said of him, that he addressed his letters to the &#x27;Island of New England.&#x27;&quot;

Thomas Hollis (1659–1731) was a major benefactor of Harvard College. According to Worcester, about the year 1775, town records started appearing with the town&#x27;s name spelled as &quot;Hollis&quot;, after Thomas Hollis. Both spellings were used until about 1815, after which only the name &quot;Hollis&quot; appears, &quot;...while Holles, the name of the Duke of Newcastle, has passed into merited oblivion.&quot;

=== First settlers ===

Captain Peter Powers (1707–1757), his wife Anna Keyes (1708–1798), and their two children Peter (1729–1800) and Stephen (born 1729) were the first settlers of Hollis, in 1731. In 1732, the Powers birthed the first child in Hollis, a daughter, also named Anna. According to Spaulding&#x27;s history, Powers &quot;became a noted backwoodsman and colonial land surveyor,&quot; and eventually accrued approximately in the north part of Hollis. Powers was also a militia officer in the French and Indian Wars and was commissioned captain by Governor Wentworth.

The younger Peter was the first college graduate from Hollis, matriculating from Harvard in 1754. He served as pastor of churches throughout New England and died at the age of 71 in Deer Island, Maine.

=== Notable events ===
* From its charter in 1746 until about 1763, Hollis was engaged in a running border dispute with Dunstable (now Nashua, New Hampshire) over a small settlement at &quot;One Pine Hill&quot;, near Flint Pond. The General Court eventually resolved the dispute in favor of Hollis.
* In 1769, a strip one and a quarter miles wide on the western border of Hollis was incorporated into the new town of Raby. In 1785, the General Court granted a petition of Raby to annex an additional three-quarters of a mile of the western Hollis border. In 1796, the name of Raby was changed to Brookline
* In 1770, by act of the General Court, Hollis annexed a portion of the town of Monson when its charter was repealed by its own request.
* In 1773, Hollis acquired some more land from Dunstable in a dispute over the building and upkeep of a bridge over the Nashua River.
* In 1794, the town of Milford was incorporated, subsuming an area of from the northwest corner of Hollis, resulting in a total size, by an 1806 survey, of some .

=== Notable facts ===
The following is from Worcester&#x27;s &quot;History of Hollis&quot;:
* When Hollis was incorporated, the town tax list comprised 54 families.
* By 1760, that number had risen to over 105 families.
* In 1767, two of the 384 slaves in New Hampshire resided in Hollis. In 1775, four of the 656 slaves in New Hampshire resided in Hollis.
* The first trial for murder in Hillsborough County was of Israel Wilkins Jr, of Hollis, for the murder of his father, Israel Wilkins Sr., on November 2, 1772. The elder Wilkins died of &quot;a blow upon the head...of the length three inches and the depth of one inch.&quot; Wilkins Jr. was found guilty of man-slaughter, pleaded benefit of clergy, and was subsequently branded upon the thumb with the letter &quot;T&quot;, and forced to forfeit all his goods to the King.
* Two-thirds of the grantees of the charter for the town of Plymouth, New Hampshire, were from Hollis, causing Worcester to refer to it as &quot;A Hollis Colony&quot;.
* Eight Hollis residents were killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill.
* 125 Hollis men were in the army in whole or in part during the year 1776, approximately one tenth of the population.
* 22 Hollis men died while in the army during the Revolutionary War.
* In 1820, Hollis had five grain mills, six saw mills, one clothing mill, two taverns and four stores. By 1878, it had one grain mill, no saw or clothing mills, no taverns, and one store.

=== Railroad ===
Hollis was a station stop on the Worcester &amp; Nashua Railroad, which built its line through the town in 1848 as part of a through route between Worcester, Massachusetts and Portland, Maine. The line was later acquired in 1886 by the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad. The WN&amp;P from Hollis to Nashua, New Hampshire, was abandoned in 1941, and the B&amp;M subsequently renamed the remaining line south to Ayer, Massachusetts the Hollis Branch. The B&amp;M continued to provide freight service until the Hollis Branch was abandoned in 1982, with a fuel dealer being the last rail customer in town.

=== Historical population change ===


The table to the right and nearby chart, taken primarily from historical data from the U.S. Census Bureau, shows the population of Hollis from 1767 through 2010.






After nearly doubling in population over the last 33 years of the 18th century, Hollis&#x27; population consistently declined (excepting only the decade of the 1850s and the first decade of the 20th century) for 120 years, not returning to the levels of 1800 until sometime during the 1950s. Since 1930, Hollis&#x27; population has consistently grown, particularly during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.

== Culture ==
Hollis has a number of town traditions and celebrations characteristic of old New England towns, including two harvest festivals and the annual celebration &quot;Old Home Days.&quot;

=== Old Home Days ===
Hollis Old Home Days is &quot;an annual weekend celebration of the days of &#x27;Hollis Past&#x27;.&quot; Old Home Days were originally established in New Hampshire in 1899, by then Governor Frank West Rollins, in an attempt to draw people back to New Hampshire towns. Hollis Old Home Days was reestablished in 1996 in commemoration of the town&#x27;s 250th anniversary. The 2010 event included &quot;amusement rides, parade, barbecue, silent auction, booths, fireworks, live music, balloon rides, pet parade, heritage craft demonstrations&quot; and various other activities. It is generally held over the second weekend in September at Nichols Field in downtown Hollis.

== Transportation ==
There are four New Hampshire State Routes within Hollis.

*NH 111 cross the extreme southeastern corner of the town, connecting to Pepperell, Massachusetts, in the south and Nashua in the east. It is known locally as Runnells Bridge Road.
*NH 111A starts at NH 111 and goes east into Nashua. It is known locally as Groton Road.
*NH 122 is the main north–south route, running through the town center and connecting to Pepperell, Massachusetts, in the south and Amherst in the north. It is known locally as Pepperell Road, Main Street, and Silver Lake Road.
*NH 130 is the main east–west route, running through the town center and connecting to Brookline in the west and Nashua in the east. It is known locally as Proctor Hill Road, Ash Street, and Broad Street.

== Education ==
There are four schools in Hollis, two of which are part of the Hollis/Brookline Cooperative School District. Hollis Primary School serves kindergarten through third grade, and Hollis Upper Elementary School serves grades four through six. Hollis/Brookline Middle School serves seventh and eighth grade and Hollis/Brookline High School serves grades nine through twelve. Seventh grade is the first year that Hollis and Brookline students attend the same school. From then on, the student body is a combination of students from both neighboring towns. In past years, the graduating class was made up of about 100 students from each town, resulting in 200 students total. For many years, the current primary school was known as Hollis Elementary School and served kindergarten through grade six. 

The current middle school (known as Hollis/Brookline Junior High School until 2001) was formerly Hollis/Brookline High School but became too small for the number of students attending. A new building was built and became the Hollis/Brookline Junior High School. However, the three buildings were still insufficient, and a new high school was opened in 1998. The former high school became the current middle school, the former middle school became Hollis Upper Elementary School, and the former Hollis Elementary became Hollis Primary. 

The historic Farley Building (formerly known as simply the &quot;White Building&quot;) is the original Hollis High School built in 1877 and continued to be used as a school building through the 2005–2006 school year. During this last year for the Farley Building, it contained classrooms for English, social studies, art, French, and Spanish. The Town of Hollis acquired the Farley Building from the Hollis School District in August 2007.

<text>Litchfield is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 8,478 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
Prior to European settlement, the area was populated by the Abenaki people. They were skilled with fishing and were adept in agriculture as well. The New Hampshire Archaeological Society has located over 30 Native American sites along the shore of the Merrimack River in Litchfield, with artifacts several thousands of years old being uncovered.

Most of Litchfield was part of the large town known as Dunstable, which was organized in the 1600s and included land along both sides of the disputed New Hampshire-Massachusetts boundary, and out of which were carved several towns and cities in both states. The area which became Litchfield was originally known as &quot;Naticook&quot;. In 1656, William Brenton, colonial governor of Rhode Island, was granted land which included much of present-day Litchfield. The name was changed to &quot;Brenton&#x27;s Farm&quot; in 1729. The town was first incorporated into Massachusetts on July 4, 1734. The first town meeting was held on Monday, July 29, 1734, at 1 pm at the house of Aquila Underwood to choose town officers. In 1749, the land was granted to another group of settlers and named &quot;Litchfield&quot; after George Henry Lee, Earl of Lichfield. Litchfield was incorporated into the Province of New Hampshire on June 5, 1749.
Litchfield lacks any major population center or central village. Historically farmland, the town experienced steep population growth starting in the 1970s, along with the rest of southern New Hampshire, as a bedroom community and exurb for Greater Boston. The original town hall was located along New Hampshire Route 3A in the east-central portion of the town; the current town hall lies at the town&#x27;s geographic center at the intersection of Hillcrest Road and Albuquerque Avenue. There are no large commercial districts in the town, though a few small industrial parks, convenience stores, and small restaurants dot the landscape.

On December 12, 1991, a cross burning took place in Litchfield, but no one was hurt. In 1995, Russell Trim was arrested and charged with the crime.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and is water, comprising 2.50% of the town. The highest point in Litchfield is the summit of Rocky Hill, near the center of town in Litchfield State Forest, at above sea level. The town is bordered to the north by Manchester, to the east by Londonderry in Rockingham County, to the south by Hudson, to the west by Merrimack, and to the extreme southwest by Nashua, with the Merrimack River separating Litchfield from both Merrimack and Nashua. There is no bridge connecting Litchfield and Merrimack; the closest river crossings are to the south between Nashua and Hudson, and to the north between Manchester and Bedford.

There are two islands in the Merrimack River within the borders of Litchfield. The islands have been called &quot;Minnewawa&quot; and &quot;Nunnehaha&quot;, the Naticook Islands, and Reed&#x27;s Islands. The northern island is located within Litchfield, while the southern island is essentially split down the middle by the boundary between Litchfield and Merrimack, forming the only land border between the two towns. Merrimack owns both islands.

== Transportation ==
Two New Hampshire state highways cross Litchfield:

*New Hampshire Route 3A closely parallels the Merrimack River, entering the town from Hudson in the south, and leaving the town into Manchester in the north. It is known as the Charles Bancroft Highway through the town.
*New Hampshire Route 102 (Derry Road) crosses the extreme southeast corner of town. It enters Hudson at both borders.

Though the town borders Merrimack on the west, it cannot be directly accessed as there are no bridges across the river. Access to Londonderry, to the east of Litchfield, is primarily via Hillcrest Road, which is the main east-west thoroughfare across central Litchfield.

Litchfield has no air or rail transport within the town limits. The nearest commercial airport is Manchester–Boston Regional Airport along the border of Londonderry and Manchester, which is close to the northern border of Litchfield. The nearest rail service is the Lowell Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail system, which can be accessed at the Charles A. Gallagher Transit Terminal in Lowell, Massachusetts. The nearest Amtrak stations are Boston&#x27;s North Station or South Station. There was a trolley that ran through Litchfield in the early 20th century, but it was long since discontinued and fallen into disrepair. There are few remnants left, including a portion of rail trail and a dilapidated trolley bridge within Parker Park.

== Government and municipal services ==

The town of Litchfield operates a waste management and transfer station on Hillcrest Road, located near the geographical center of Litchfield and the &quot;new&quot; town hall, police and fire station. The historical center of Litchfield is on the Charles Bancroft Highway (New Hampshire Route 3A). Today the first church in Litchfield, the Litchfield Community Television studio, and the Litchfield Historical Society are located there in and around the old town hall and fire station. The town&#x27;s new fire station opened on Liberty Way in May 2019.

Several public parks, including Roy Memorial Park and the Litchfield State Forest, are open year-round to the public. Municipal parks are managed by the Litchfield Recreation Commission. The state forest is managed by the New Hampshire Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, among other agencies.

The Litchfield Mosquito Control District was featured on &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot;. The episode featured segments from a televised town meeting from September 17, 2015, which had no members of the public in attendance.

The town has several conservation areas, including Moore&#x27;s Falls, Parker Park, and Stage Crossing. The Litchfield Conservation Commission holds the responsibility of managing these lands for the preservation and proper utilization of natural resources in town.

<text>Lyndeborough is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,702 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Originally granted by the Massachusetts General Court to veterans from Salem, Massachusetts, of New England&#x27;s first war with Canada, the area was known as &quot;Salem-Canada&quot;. John Cram and his family were the first settlers and established a sawmill in the community in 1736. The name &quot;Lyndeborough&quot; resulted from a re-grant to a group of people that included Benjamin Lynde, who later became Chief Justice of Massachusetts. This group of proprietors never lived in Lyndeborough and may never have visited the community. For instance, while serving as a proprietor of Lyndeborough, Judge Lynde lived in Massachusetts, where he presided in Suffolk County over the trial stemming from the Boston Massacre.

The town has been home to the Lafayette Artillery Company (founded 1804) since 1833. The town office building, Citizens&#x27; Hall (opened 1889), is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the Lyndeborough Center Historic District, which consists of the Congregational church (), town hall (1846), and remnants of the town pound (1774).

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.38% of the town. The central and southern portions of town are drained by Stony Brook and Curtis Brook, southeast-flowing tributaries of the Souhegan River, while the northern part is drained by Cold Brook, an east-flowing tributary of the South Branch Piscataquog River. The entire town is part of the Merrimack River watershed.

The highest point in Lyndeborough is just shy of above sea level, where the east ridge of North Pack Monadnock Mountain crosses the town&#x27;s western border. Notable summits in town include Winn Mountain (), Rose Mountain (), and The Pinnacle (). The town is crossed by New Hampshire Route 31, which leads northwest into Greenfield and southeast into Wilton.

<text>Blue Springs is a city in Jackson County, Missouri, United States. Blue Springs is located east of Kansas City. It is the 8th largest city in the Kansas City metropolitan area and 10th largest city in the state of Missouri. As of the 2020 census, the population was 58,604.

==History==
As early as 1825, a spring of water flowing from the side of a hill and falling into a tributary of Little Blue River attracted campers, traders, and many of those starting on the Santa Fe expeditions. They met here preparatory to crossing the plains. The spring was named Blue Springs by freighters freighting provisions to the Harmony Mission, on the Marias de Cygnes River in Bates County Missouri, from Lexington, Missouri in Lafayette County.

The presence of water and a need for supplies led to the construction of a grist mill and a permanent settlement of Blue Springs near the spring. The original town site of Blue Springs and the spring for which Blue Springs was named was located near what became Burrus Old Mill Park.

An early settler, Franklin Smith, arrived in Blue Springs from Virginia in 1838, and became a leading figure in the community&#x27;s development. He established the first post office in 1845, naming it after the well-known springs.

The settlement continued to grow near the springs until March 1878, when the Chicago and Alton Railroad announced plans to build a station about one mile east of the original settlement. To take advantage of the commerce the railroad would bring, the town moved its center to the site of the new station and continued its development as a rural trading center. The Chicago &amp; Alton Hotel built in 1878 is the oldest business in the city.

The Jackson County Court granted the incorporation of Blue Springs as a town on September 7, 1880, making it the fourth settlement in the county to be incorporated. On January 12, 1904, Blue Springs was incorporated as a 4th class city. Blue Springs adopted a Constitutional Charter and became Home Rule Charter City in April of 1994.

The former Bank of Blue Springs was established in 1883. It had a capital surplus of $50,000 in 1926.

Yet another claim as namesake is Thomas W. Buckner, an original owner of the site.

<text>Manchester is the most populous city in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 115,644. Manchester is the tenth-most populous city in New England and a major city within the boundaries of the Greater Boston metropolitan area.

Manchester is, along with the city of Nashua, one of two seats of New Hampshire&#x27;s most populous county, Hillsborough County. Manchester lies near the northern end of the Northeast megalopolis and straddles the banks of the Merrimack River. It was first named by the merchant and inventor Samuel Blodget(t), eponym of Samuel Blodget Park and Blodget Street in the city&#x27;s North End. His vision was to create a great industrial center similar to that of the original Manchester in England, which was the world&#x27;s first industrialized city.

During the Industrial Revolution, Manchester was a major industrial and economic hub for New England, with the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company being the largest cotton textile plant in the world. After World War II, many textile manufacturing jobs left Manchester, but new industries and companies were introduced to the city, such as DEKA.

==History==
The native Pennacook people called Amoskeag Falls on the Merrimack River—the area that became the heart of Manchester—&quot;Namaoskeag&quot;, meaning &quot;good fishing place&quot;. In 1722, John Goffe III settled beside Cohas Brook, later building a dam and sawmill at what was dubbed &quot;Old Harry&#x27;s Town&quot;. It was granted by Massachusetts in 1727 as &quot;Tyngstown&quot; to veterans of Queen Anne&#x27;s War who served in 1703 under Captain William Tyng. But at New Hampshire&#x27;s 1741 separation from Massachusetts, the grant was ruled invalid and substituted with Wilton, Maine, resulting in a 1751 rechartering by Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Derryfield&quot;—a name that lives on in Derryfield Park, Derryfield Country Club, and the private Derryfield School.

In 1807, Samuel Blodget opened a canal and lock system to allow vessels passage around the falls, part of a network developing to link the area with Boston. He envisioned a great industrial center arising, &quot;the Manchester of America&quot;, in reference to Manchester, England, then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. In 1809, Benjamin Prichard and others built a water-powered cotton spinning mill on the western bank of the Merrimack. Apparently following Blodgett&#x27;s suggestion, Derryfield was renamed &quot;Manchester&quot; in 1810, the year the mill was incorporated as the Amoskeag Cotton &amp; Woolen Manufacturing Company. It would be purchased in 1825 by entrepreneurs from Massachusetts, expanded to three mills in 1826, and then incorporated in 1831 as the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company.

Amoskeag engineers and architects planned a model company town on the eastern bank, founded in 1838 with Elm Street as its main thoroughfare. Incorporation as a city followed for Manchester in 1846, soon home to the largest cotton mill in the world—Mill No. 11, stretching long by wide, and containing 4,000 looms. Other products made in the community included shoes, cigars, and paper. The Amoskeag foundry made rifles, sewing machines, textile machinery, fire engines, and locomotives in a division called the Amoskeag Locomotive Works (later, the Manchester Locomotive Works). The rapid growth of the mills demanded a large influx of workers, resulting in a flood of immigrants, particularly French Canadians. Many current residents descend from these workers. In 1871, the arch dam was built on the Merrimack River, enhancing the mill&#x27;s water power delivery system. By 1912, the production of woven cloth in the Millyard had reached a production rate of 50 miles in length per hour.

Throughout the late 19th century and the early 20th century, the city began to expand outward, and many streetcar suburbs such as Mast Road were built. Manchester was formerly home to a streetcar network, the Manchester Street Railway. The streetcar network was replaced with a bus network in the 1940s.

In 1922, 17,000 workers from two of the city&#x27;s largest companies (Amoskeag and Stark Manufacturing Companies) went on strike for a period of nine months. After the strike, the textile industry began a slow decline, with the Great Depression hitting the city particularly hard. The Amoskeag Manufacturing Company declared bankruptcy in 1935. During the Great Flood of 1936, the McGregor Bridge was destroyed and $2.5 million of damage was incurred to the city&#x27;s mills and buildings. After the flood, the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company reorganized out of bankruptcy as Amoskeag Industries, diversifying its manufacturing operations with new industries in the Millyard.

Manchester&#x27;s economy benefitted from World War II, as the city was already well-positioned and equipped with industry to handle war-time production. In 1941, Grenier Field, on the city&#x27;s border with Londonderry, was converted to a U.S. Army air base.

The city faced a decline in manufacturing in the 1950s and 1960s, with many Millyard buildings becoming abandoned during this time. An anthrax incident in 1957 led to the abandonment and later razing of the Arms Textile Mill along the river (today a parking lot in front of Arms Park). As part of urban renewal projects, the city filled in the Millyard canals to make room for roads and demolished several mill structures to make way for parking and roads. The Mall of New Hampshire opened in 1977, leading to further decline of downtown. However, during this time several important buildings were constructed in the downtown area, including the Hampshire Plaza in 1972 (the tallest building in New Hampshire until 1994, later renamed Brady Sullivan Plaza).

The 1980s brought renewed interest in the Millyard and downtown. The University of New Hampshire at Manchester opened a campus in the Millyard during this time, and Segway inventor Dean Kamen purchased two old mill buildings which became the headquarters for DEKA. Kamen purchased more buildings in 1984 and 1991, aiming to convert the Millyard into a high-tech center for smart manufacturing and offices. John Madden, a local developer, and Kamen worked with the city to implement capital improvements to the Millyard in the 1980s and early 1990s.

City Hall Plaza was built in downtown Manchester in 1992, to this day the tallest building in New Hampshire and northern New England. In 1991, the city went into economic decline as four major banks were shut down by federal regulators. Many shops and restaurants along the Elm Street thoroughfare closed during this time, as foot traffic declined. At the turn of the century, renewed interest in the Millyard led to a boom in development and business. Several high-tech firms opened offices or relocated to the Manchester Millyard in the 2000s, including Autodesk in 2000 and Dyn in 2004. Brady Sullivan, a local real estate developer, opened its first Millyard apartments in 2013. During the early to mid 2010s, Manchester saw an uptick in opioid-related deaths, reporting more opioid-related deaths per capita than any city in the United States in 2016. Since 2018, the death rate has declined through the efforts of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services and local outreach organizations, hitting a 10-year low in 2023.

Manchester has continued to grow steadily and transform itself into a cultural and commerce hub for the state of New Hampshire. The mill town&#x27;s 19th-century affluence left behind some of the finest Victorian commercial, municipal, and residential architecture in the state.

==Geography==

Manchester is in south-central New Hampshire, south of Concord, the state capital, and the same distance north of Nashua, the second-largest city in the state. Manchester is north-northwest of Boston, the largest city in New England.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 5.33% of the city. Manchester is drained by the Merrimack River and its tributaries the Piscataquog River and Cohas Brook. Massabesic Lake is on the eastern border. The highest point in Manchester is atop Wellington Hill, where the elevation reaches above sea level.

===Neighborhoods===

The Manchester Planning Board, in its 2010 Master Plan, defines 25 neighborhoods within the city. LivableMHT has drawn maps of the neighborhoods and neighborhood village centers as defined by the city. Recognition of particular neighborhoods varies, with some having neighborhood associations, but none have any legal or political authority.

The major neighborhoods, historically, include Amoskeag, Rimmon Heights, Notre Dame/McGregorville and Piscataquog/Granite Square, also known as &quot;Piscat&quot;, on the West Side; the North End, Janeville/Corey Square, Hallsville and Bakersville on the East Side; and Youngsville and Goffes Falls on the periphery of the city.

In 2007, the city began a Neighborhood Initiatives program to &quot;insure that our neighborhoods are vibrant, livable areas since these are the portions of the city where most of the residents spend their time living, playing, shopping and going to school.&quot; The purpose of this initiative is to foster vibrancy and redevelopment in the neighborhoods, and to restore the sense of neighborhood communities that had been overlooked in the city for some time. The city began the program with street-scape and infrastructure improvements in the Rimmon Heights neighborhood of the West Side, which has spurred growth and investment in and by the community. Despite the success of the program in Rimmon Heights, it was unclear in recent years how the city planned to implement similar programs throughout the city. The city announced plans for extending the Neighborhood Initiatives program to the Hollow neighborhood in February 2012.

Manchester is nicknamed the Queen City, as well as the more recently coined &quot;Manch Vegas&quot;. The Mall of New Hampshire, on Manchester&#x27;s southern fringe near the intersection of Interstates 93 and 293, is the city&#x27;s main retail center. In 2001, the Verizon Wireless Arena, a venue seating more than 10,000, opened for major concerts and sporting events, enhancing the city&#x27;s downtown revitalization efforts with a major hotel and convention center already in place across the street from the arena. The building was renamed the SNHU Arena in 2016, after Manchester&#x27;s Southern New Hampshire University.

In 2021, &quot;Business Insider&quot; named Manchester number 12 on its list of the 25 best cities to start a business in.

===Downtown===
Downtown Manchester&#x27;s One City Hall Plaza stands 22 stories high, quickly followed by the all-black, 20-story Brady Sullivan Plaza, formerly known as the Hampshire Plaza. They are the tallest New England buildings north of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Sullivan Plaza is shorter than City Hall Plaza by a mere . Other major buildings include the 18-story Wall Street Apartments tower; the 14-story, recently renamed Brady Sullivan Tower, which was the former New Hampshire Insurance building; the 12-story DoubleTree Hotel and Convention Center Manchester (which serves the SNHU Arena across the street), the Carpenter Center (a former hotel), and the Hampshire Towers condominium building; the 10-story Citizens Bank Building, which was, for much of the early- and mid-20th century, Manchester&#x27;s iconic Amoskeag Bank &quot;skyscraper&quot;; and several high-rises of or exceeding 10 stories on the city&#x27;s West Side. This partial list only includes residential and commercial buildings and does not include hospitals, spires and domes, etc.

The SNHU Arena has become the centerpiece of downtown Manchester. The venue can seat slightly less than 12,000 patrons for concerts, and at least 10,000-seat configurations for sporting and other forms of entertainment. It has also hosted major recording artists and comedians, national touring theatrical productions, family-oriented shows, and fairs since it opened in 2001. The Northeast Delta Dental Stadium (formerly MerchantsAuto.com Stadium) is a baseball park on the Merrimack River in downtown Manchester and is home to the local AA baseball affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats. Historic Gill Stadium supported professional minor-league baseball into the early 21st century and continues to be a viable and popular downtown venue for many sporting and entertainment events, seating nearly 4,000 patrons, depending on the event format.

In recent years there has been continual redevelopment of the Amoskeag Millyard and its residential Historic District. The increasing popularity of downtown living has caused many properties originally built as tenement housing for mill workers in the 19th century to be converted to stylish, eclectic residential condominiums. Many new retail stores and higher education institutions, including the University of New Hampshire at Manchester, have been uniquely retro-fitted into properties along Commercial and Canal Street.

===Shopping===
Manchester has three main retail areas: downtown Manchester, South Willow Street (NH Route 28), and Second Street (NH Route 3A) on the West Side. The Mall of New Hampshire is on South Willow Street, and, with more than 125 stores, is one of the largest shopping centers in southern New Hampshire and central New England.

==Arts and culture==
Cultural landmarks include the historic Palace Theatre, the Currier Museum of Art, the New Hampshire Institute of Art, the Franco-American Center, the Manchester Historic Association Millyard Museum, the Massabesic Audubon Center, the Amoskeag Fishways Learning and Visitors Center, the Lawrence L. Lee Scouting Museum and Max I. Silber Library, the Zimmerman House and Kalil House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and the SEE Science Center. Valley Cemetery, the resting place of numerous prominent citizens since 1841, is an early example of a garden-style burial ground.

The John F. Kennedy Memorial Coliseum is another, smaller venue in downtown Manchester with a capacity of approximately 3,000 seats. It was completed in 1963, serves as home ice for the Manchester Central and Memorial High School hockey teams, and is home to the Southern New Hampshire Skating Club.

The nickname &quot;ManchVegas&quot; was derived from illegal gambling in local businesses during the late 1980s or early 1990s. Many pizza shops and local bars had video poker machines that would pay out real money. The nickname was coined following a citywide campaign of law enforcement. It was then adopted as a lampoon of the city&#x27;s limited entertainment opportunities. The term has since become a source of pride as the city&#x27;s entertainment scene has grown. By 2003, it was well enough known that a note on Virtualtourist.com said, &quot;Residents reflect the regional dry humor by referring to sedate Manchester as &#x27;ManchVegas&#x27;.&quot; By 2005, an article in Manchester&#x27;s &quot;Hippo&quot; (a local alternative weekly) said that then-Mayor Robert A. Baines &quot;is pushing to replace the nickname ManchVegas with Manchhattan&quot; (meaning Manchester+Manhattan). In 2009, the film &quot;Monsters, Marriage and Murder in ManchVegas&quot; was released referencing Manchester&#x27;s popular nickname and using much of the city as its backdrop.

Manchester has a growing collective of artists, due in large part to the influx of young students at the New Hampshire Institute of Art, Southern New Hampshire University, and the University of New Hampshire at Manchester. Slam Free or Die, New Hampshire&#x27;s only weekly slam poetry venue, is in Manchester.

The Manchester City Library has served the city&#x27;s residents since the mid-1850s and has been housed in the Carpenter Memorial Building on Pine Street since 1914. There is a branch location on North Main Street on the West Side.

===Chicken Tender Capital of the World===
At a public meeting on December 6, 2022, comedian Nick Lavallee suggested that Mayor Joyce Craig and the Board of Aldermen declare Manchester &quot;The Chicken Tender Capital of the World&quot;. Lavallee&#x27;s initiative, documented by &quot;New Hampshire&quot; magazine, included paying respect to the Puritan Backroom for having invented the chicken tender and celebrating all chicken tenders offered by other Manchester establishments. Mayor Craig positively recognized the effort on her Facebook page on February 16, 2023. Lavallee first mentioned Manchester&#x27;s association with the chicken tender during his appearance on &quot;The Beat with Ari Melber&quot;, a nationally broadcast television program hosted by Ari Melber, on February 7, 2020. Mayor Craig officially declared Manchester &quot;The Chicken Tender Capital of the World&quot; on July 27, 2023. Lavallee read the city&#x27;s official resolution on field at Delta Dental Stadium before the New Hampshire Fisher Cats played as &quot;The Manchester Chicken Tenders&quot;.

==Sports==
The city is home to McIntyre Ski Area, which opened in 1971. There are also college sports teams that play in and out of the city. Saint Anselm College is located less than a mile outside the city&#x27;s border in Goffstown, although it has a Manchester postal address, and Southern New Hampshire University is located primarily in Hooksett, but has its campus partially within city limits. The two colleges participate in the NCAA Division II Northeast-10 Conference, and the school with the most head-to-head victories in a school year earns the Queen City Cup.

===Professional===
Manchester is the only city in New Hampshire with professional sports teams. The three-time Eastern League champion New Hampshire Fisher Cats play at Delta Dental Stadium. The New Hampshire Kingz of the American Basketball Association play within the Manchester Baller&#x27;s Association complex at Sundial Center.

From 2001 to 2015, the Manchester Monarchs played in the American Hockey League. In their final season in Manchester, the Monarchs won the league championship. From 2015 to 2019, the city hosted the lower-division Manchester Monarchs in the ECHL. Both teams were based at the SNHU Arena (formerly known as the Verizon Wireless Arena.)

From 2002 through 2009, the arena was also the home of a professional arena football team: the Manchester Wolves of AF2.

==Government==
Manchester is incorporated as a city under the laws of the state of New Hampshire, and operates under a strong mayoral form of government. The mayor serves as chairman of the fourteen-member Board of Mayor and Aldermen, the city&#x27;s legislative body. Each of Manchester&#x27;s twelve wards elects a single alderman, and two additional at-large members are elected citywide. Jay Ruais is the current mayor.

The mayor also serves as the chair of the board of school committee. Like the board of aldermen, the school board has twelve members elected by ward and two at-large members. The school board is not a city department; rather, it is a school district coterminous with the city, which obtains financing from the Board of Mayor and Aldermen.

In the New Hampshire Senate, Manchester is represented by three state senators:

* Keith Murphy (Republican-District 16): includes Manchester Ward 1 
* Donna Soucy (Democrat-District 18): Wards 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
* Lou D&#x27;Allesandro (Democrat District 20): Wards 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12

In the New Hampshire Executive Council, Manchester is included within the 4th District and is represented by Republican Ted Gatsas, the city&#x27;s former mayor. Manchester is included within New Hampshire&#x27;s 1st congressional district and is represented by Democrat Chris Pappas.

At the presidential level, Manchester leans Democratic. George W. Bush narrowly carried the city by 170 votes in 2004, but no other presidential elections since then have been nearly as close. In 2020, Joe Biden won the highest percentage of the vote in Manchester since 1964.


==Education==

===Television===
Manchester is on the northern edge of the Boston television market. The following stations are based in Greater Manchester:

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
====Air====
Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, the fourth-largest passenger and third-largest cargo airport in New England, serves the city.

====Roads====
Two Interstate Highways, one U.S. Route, and six New Hampshire State Routes in the city. These include:
*Interstate 93
*Interstate 293
*U.S. Route 3
*New Hampshire Route 3A
*New Hampshire Route 28
*New Hampshire Route 28A
*NH 28 Bypass, known as Londonderry Turnpike.
*New Hampshire Route 101
*New Hampshire Route 114A
====Bus====
The Manchester Transit Authority runs several local bus routes throughout the city and surrounding areas, and operates three regional bus routes called the Zip Line service, which offers express service from Manchester to Concord, Nashua, and Salem, New Hampshire. Greyhound Lines operates bus service between Manchester and destinations in the Northeast.

====Passenger rail====
Into the 1950s, numerous Boston and Maine Railroad trains operated out of Manchester Union Station, going to points northwest as far as Montreal, north to Woodsville, east to Portsmouth and south to Boston, among these the &quot;Alouette&quot; and the &quot;Ambassador&quot; (both of these being Boston - Montreal trains). The last services were a once a day train between Boston and Concord; this service ended in 1967.

A proposed extension of the MBTA Commuter Rail&#x27;s Lowell Line would see MBTA Commuter Rail service running as far north as Manchester with service frequencies similar to that of the current Lowell Line. A study currently being carried out by AECOM and the State of New Hampshire to design and make a financial plan for the project is due to be completed by 2023. The proposed Manchester station location would be located behind the Market Basket grocery store on Elm Street.

With the expansion of Interstate 93 to eight lanes from Salem to Manchester under construction, space is being reserved in the median for potential future commuter or light rail service along this corridor. The I-93 transit study also suggested restoring service on the Manchester and Lawrence branch for commuter and freight rail. This corridor would support freight rail along with commuter, something that light rail cannot do.

In late 2011, Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and owner of several buildings in the Millyard, as well as co-founder of FIRST, proposed a rail loop for downtown and the Millyard. Several meetings have been held with area business and property owners, city officials and local developers, but the idea is in the early conceptual stages.

The downtown rail loop, if approved by the Board of Mayor and Aldermen, would be about three miles long. The loop would go from the Manchester Millyards, down south for about half a mile, then turn over Elm Street, separate into two rails (the other going towards Manchester-Boston Regional Airport), and climb north to Bridge Street, ending at the Brady Sullivan Tower at the northern end of Elm Street. More concrete plans were revealed in 2018.

In 2021, Amtrak announced plans to implement new service from Boston to Concord, including a stop at Manchester, by 2035.

===Public safety===

====Law enforcement====
Law enforcement is provided by the Manchester Police Department. The Manchester police station is at 405 Valley Street on the corner of Valley and Maple.

The Hillsborough County Department of Corrections is at 445 Willow Street. The prison houses an average of 500 inmates.

====Fire department====
The city of Manchester is protected all year by the 200 paid, professional firefighters (IAFF Local 856) of the City of Manchester Fire Department. The department is commanded by a Chief of Department, Daniel Goonan, one Assistant Chief, and five District Chiefs. The Manchester Fire Department operates out of ten fire stations throughout the city, and operates a fire apparatus fleet of ten engines, four ladder trucks (two staffed/two cross-staffed by the engine), one rescue, and one district chief (two if manpower permits). The Manchester Fire Department responds to over 26,000 emergency calls annually.

<text>Mason is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,448 at the 2020 census. Mason, together with Wilton, is home to Russell-Abbott State Forest.

==History==
Mason was first known as &quot;Number One&quot;, the easternmost in a line of border towns including area allotted to the Province of New Hampshire after its border with neighboring Massachusetts was fixed in 1739. The town was granted its own charter in 1749 by colonial governor Benning Wentworth, and in 1768 his nephew, Governor John Wentworth, named it in honor of New Hampshire&#x27;s founder, Captain John Mason, who along with Sir Ferdinando Gorges had been granted the territory in 1622 by the Council of New England. In 1629 the land grant was split between the two proprietors, with Gorges retaining the eastern portion of the territory (present-day Maine), and Mason holding the patent with title to the land that became New Hampshire.

Greenville was set off from Mason in 1872.

Near the center of Mason is the boyhood home of Samuel Wilson, the meat supplier who is believed to have inspired the Uncle Sam character. The private house is today identified by a state historical marker. Another prominent local figure was Elizabeth Orton Jones, an author, illustrator and teacher better known as &quot;Twig&quot;. Jones is noted for her recording of town history and her dedication to Andy&#x27;s Summer Playhouse, a renowned youth theater founded in Mason. Pickity Place, a local cottage built in 1759 by Ebenezer Blood, was the model for the grandmother&#x27;s house in Jones&#x27; 1948 illustrated version of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;. Pickity Place was created by David and Judith Walter.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are water, comprising 0.23% of the town. Mason is drained to the east by Spaulding Brook, Gould Mill Brook, and Wallace Brook, tributaries of the Nissitissit River, and to the south by Walker Brook, a tributary of the Squannacook River in Massachusetts. The Nissitissit and Squannacook are both tributaries of the Nashua River, and the entire town is thereby part of the Merrimack River watershed. The town&#x27;s highest point is above sea level, on an unnamed summit near the border with Greenville.

Mason is bordered by New Ipswich and Greenville to the west, Wilton to the north, Milford to the northeast, Brookline to the east, and Ashby, Massachusetts, and Townsend, Massachusetts, to the south.

On June 22, 1969, an F4 (max. wind speeds 207-260 mph) tornado 13.5 miles away from the De Soto city center killed two people and injured 22 people and caused between $500,000 and $5,000,000 in damages.

On April 22, 1981, a tornado destroyed the Joachim Savings &amp; Loan, the offices of the Republic and Press newspaper, and a tire store. One person was killed in the Savings &amp; Loan.

On May 6, 2003, at approximately 3:45 pm, a tornado outbreak began in Kansas, Missouri, and Tennessee. At 5:14pm, a tornado touched down two miles northwest of De Soto. Fourteen minutes later, the tornado sirens went off in Jefferson County. The tornado hit De Soto at F3 intensity, causing $12,800,000 in damage.

<doc id="124774" wikidata="Q2266624" url="?curid=124774" title="Merrimack, New Hampshire">
<text>Merrimack is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 26,632 as of the 2020 census.

There are four villages in the town: Merrimack Village (formerly known as Souhegan Village), Thorntons Ferry, Reeds Ferry, and South Merrimack.

== History ==

The first known settlers of the area appeared sometime after the last ice age. &quot;Merrimack&quot; is a Native American term meaning sturgeon, a type of fish. The Pennacook people named the Merrimack River after this fish because of the vast population that once existed there. The Pennacooks spelled it &quot;Monnomoke&quot; or &quot;Merramake&quot;. &quot;When the town was incorporated, it took the name of the river and spelled it Merrymac,&quot; according to the Merrimack Historical Society.

The first mention of the territory containing the current town of Merrimack among written records was the petition of Passaconaway to the General Court of Massachusetts for a grant of land to include a part of this region. This was in 1662, and in the autumn of that year the court acceded to the request, and the aged sachem and his associates were granted a strip of country a mile and a half wide on both banks of the Merrimack at this section of the river. Although the boundaries of this grant are not specifically known today, it is probable that the chieftain held at least a portion of the current town of Merrimack. European settlers first came to the area in the late 17th century when the area was still in dispute between the Province of New Hampshire and Massachusetts Bay Colony.

The town of Merrimack was originally part of the 1673 Dunstable grant. On June 25, 1734, Massachusetts granted the town organization as &quot;Naticook&quot;, which was made up of Litchfield and part of Merrimack. In 1746 the boundary line between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was revised, and the land which was originally part of Massachusetts became part of New Hampshire. When it went back into New Hampshire, the province disincorporated the towns of Dunstable, Naticook, and Nottingham and formed it into one giant territory again, roughly the size of the old Dunstable Grant from the 1670s.

On April 2, 1746, Governor Benning Wentworth signed a charter establishing that the land from Pennichuck Brook to the Souhegan River became the Town of Merrymac. At that time fewer than 50 families lived here. Pawtucket, Nashaway and Pennacook people camped along the banks of the Merrimack and Souhegan rivers. The Pennacooks were greatest in numbers, and their chief, Passaconaway, was the ruler of all the tribes in the Merrimack Valley. On June 5, 1750, the town&#x27;s charter was ratified, giving the town an additional to the north. The new portion called &quot;Souhegan East&quot; was made up of the land north of the Souhegan River.

Matthew Thornton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, lived and was buried in Merrimack. The Signer&#x27;s House and Matthew Thornton Cemetery are still located in the town.

The original meetinghouse was built at the exact center of town. There were two cemeteries. Turkey Hill on Meetinghouse Road is the first mentioned in the town records, but Thornton Cemetery on Route 3 has the oldest gravestone.

The nineteenth century saw much growth in Merrimack. The meetinghouse was too small and too far from what had become the center of town. The church and government became separate and two new churches were built in more convenient locations, one in South Merrimack and one on Baboosic Lake Road. A new town hall was built to replace the meetinghouse.

The Boston and Maine Railroad laid tracks through the town in the 19th century, with several stations operating until the mid-20th century, when the advent of the automobile transformed Merrimack from a largely agricultural community to a bedroom community of Boston and nearby cities in New Hampshire. Since 1970 the town has been the home of an Anheuser-Busch brewery, their easternmost, and one of their smallest plants in the United States. It is home to a brewery tour and one of the five stables for the Budweiser Clydesdales.

The Merrimack School Board attracted national attention in 1995 when it passed a &quot;prohibition of alternative lifestyle instruction&quot; act, which resulted in the removal of a work by William Shakespeare from the school curriculum. The board members who supported the act were voted out in the subsequent board election.
== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.55% of the town. The highest point in Merrimack is an unnamed hill in the northwestern part of town that reaches above sea level.

=== Areas of Merrimack ===
Shadows of the former villages that now make Merrimack still exist. However, the boundaries and exact definitions are unclear due to the expansion of suburban development in the town during the latter half of the 20th century.

==== Thorntons Ferry ====
The area of town near Naticook Lake and Continental Boulevard, its name comes from Matthew Thornton, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence who lived in Merrimack and is now buried in a cemetery near the intersection of Daniel Webster Highway (U.S. Route 3) and Greeley Street. Thorntons Ferry Elementary School is located on Camp Sargent Road.

==== Reeds Ferry ====
The northern portion of the town, Reeds Ferry is centered on the current intersection of Bedford Road and Daniel Webster Highway. The boundaries of the area are unclear, as the northwestern part of town near Baboosic Lake is not traditionally considered a portion of Reeds Ferry. While as a defined village it was located mostly near the Merrimack River, the area near Baboosic Lake may now possibly be seen as part of Reeds Ferry. Reeds Ferry Elementary School is located on Lyons Road.

==== South Merrimack ====
Centered on Pennichuck Square on Rte. 101A and Continental Boulevard, South Merrimack is usually considered to be the southwestern part of town near Rte. 101A and Boston Post Road. However, the southeastern portion of town near Harris Pond might also be considered part of South Merrimack or Thornton&#x27;s Ferry.

==== Merrimack Village ====
The center of town is not known as &quot;Merrimack Village&quot; per se, but constitutes the area between the more defined Reeds Ferry and Thorntons Ferry areas. Largely considered to be located at the Public Library on the corner of Baboosic Lake Road and Daniel Webster Highway, Merrimack Village was built along the Souhegan River that roughly cuts the current town in half. The elementary school in this part of town is named after James Mastricola, who deeded the land to the town upon his death. One of the three elementary schools, the upper elementary school, Merrimack High School, the library, and the current town hall, among other buildings, are all located on the land formerly owned by Mastricola.

The &quot;village&quot; is considered to extend westward to the Amherst border. This is due in large part to the former Town Meetinghouse, which was located on the corner of Turkey Hill Road and Meetinghouse Road.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2010 census, there were 25,494 people, 9,503 households, and 7,150 families residing in the town. There were 9,818 housing units, of which 315, or 3.2%, were vacant.

==Economy==
PC Connection and Brookstone are based in Merrimack. Merrimack Canoe Company was started in Merrimack before being relocated to Tennessee. Other notable employers include Fidelity Investments, Anheuser-Busch, Campers Inn, and BAE Systems.

Opened in 2012, the Merrimack Premium Outlets are a retail mall area with 12 buildings, parking lots, and other site improvements located off exit 10 of the Everett Turnpike.

==Education==

The six public schools in Merrimack are managed by the Merrimack School District and include Thorntons Ferry Elementary School, Reeds Ferry Elementary School, James Mastricola Elementary School, James Mastricola Upper Elementary School, Merrimack Middle School and Merrimack High School.

Merrimack High School has won one state championship in baseball (2007), three in softball (1980, 1988, 2001), one in football (1987), two in soccer (1998 girls, 2008 boys), three in indoor track (1999, 2007, 2008), four in outdoor track (2003, 2004, 2006, 2007), one in cross-country (2006), one in girls lacrosse (2012), one in skiing (1979), two in volleyball (2001, 2014), and four in basketball (1967, 2003, 2004, 2012).

The Academy for Science and Design was a charter school established for the 2007–2008 academic year; it was New Hampshire&#x27;s first charter school to concentrate on science, math, engineering, and design and is free of tuition fees. The school has since moved to Nashua. In 2014, the Gate City Charter School for the Arts opened its doors to students.

Also within the town lies the Thomas More College of Liberal Arts. The college is consistently ranked among the top liberal arts schools in the country.

== Annual events ==
The Rock&#x27;N Ribfest, hosted by the Nashua West Rotary Club, was an annual event held from 2003 through 2018, the proceeds of which benefited many local charities. In 2019 the event was hosted by the Merrimack Rotary Club and renamed the Great American Ribfest and Food Truck Festival. The ribfest is held on the Anheuser-Busch grounds in Merrimack and features BBQ, children&#x27;s games and activities, music, and other entertainment.

==Government==

The town government consists of a seven-member town council. This form of government was adopted by a ballot measure on May 25, 2006. More information on Merrimack&#x27;s local government can be found at Charter commission website.

Each March, the town conducts two deliberative sessions (school and general) to decide what warrant articles will be on the Town General Election ballot in April, one of which is always election of town officers, and another is the budget. If the budget is not approved by the voters, the town&#x27;s governing council either holds an emergency hearing regarding a new budget or goes forward with the priors years&#x27; budget, amended with any time-sensitive information pending upon the current year.

The Merrimack Village District administers the water system that serves the central area of the town.

As a large, suburban community located directly between the state&#x27;s two largest cities (Manchester and Nashua), Merrimack plays a disproportionate role to its size every four years in the New Hampshire primary; in almost every Fourth of July preceding a presidential election, every presidential candidate will march or have a float in the town&#x27;s Fourth of July parade.

In the New Hampshire Senate, Merrimack is in the 11th district and is currently represented by Democrat Shannon Chandley. On the New Hampshire Executive Council, Merrimack is in district 5 and is currently represented by Republican Dave Wheeler. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Merrimack is included in New Hampshire&#x27;s 1st congressional district and is currently represented by Democrat Chris Pappas.

Merrimack leans Republican in presidential elections, but in recent years has shifted to become a battleground town. In 2020, Joe Biden was the first Democrat to carry the town with a majority of votes since Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s landslide victory in 1964.

Republicans currently hold five of the town&#x27;s eight seats in the General Court. The current General Court district of Merrimack is Hillsborough 12.

<doc id="124775" wikidata="Q2417168" url="?curid=124775" title="Mont Vernon, New Hampshire">
<text>Mont Vernon is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,584 at the 2020 census, up from 2,409 at the 2010 census.

==Spelling==
It is not clear why the name of the community is spelled differently from the many other towns in the United States named after Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington. It was spelled without a &quot;u&quot; from the start, written that way in the town charter of 1803. Local hotel owner George Kittredge convinced the U.S. Post Office to reinstate the &quot;U&quot; in the late 1800s, apparently in hopes of boosting business, but the spelling was reverted after his death. 

==History==
Mont Vernon broke away from neighboring Amherst in 1803, following a dispute over the town parish. It later added a small portion of neighboring Lyndeborough.

Mont Vernon&#x27;s general history follows that of many towns in this region. Originally settled for agriculture, its farms were hard hit after the Civil War when railroads opened up better farming land in the Midwest. The town&#x27;s population peaked in 1870 and began to decline.

By the late 1890s, it had become a tourist town, drawing summer visitors from points south, notably Boston, who escaped the heat in Mont Vernon&#x27;s hills. At one point, it had five large summer hotels, including the Grand Hotel located on top of Grand Hill, and a number of boarding houses. The hotel business began to wither with the development of the automobile, which allowed tourists to reach places like the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and it was killed by the Great Depression. The town&#x27;s population bottomed out at barely 300 in 1930 and by World War II all the hotels were demolished or destroyed by fire, as happened to the Grand Hotel. 

Since the war, Mont Vernon has slowly become a suburban community. This was significantly accelerated in 1962–1963 when engineers and technicians employed at Sanders Associates in Nashua found homes in Mont Vernon attractive. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1970 census that the town&#x27;s official population passed mid-19th century highs.

Agriculture, including a 1940s and 1950s boom in chicken and egg farming, has all but disappeared. As of 2024, the town has one dairy farm. The town has one general store that except for a two-year period from 2010–2012 has operated for more than 120 years in the same location.

Mont Vernon made national news in March 2012 due to debate during the annual town meeting over whether to rename a small fishing hole called Jew Pond. The town eventually renamed it Carleton Pond, after the family which donated the surrounding property to the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.49% of the town. Mont Vernon is drained by Beaver Brook, Hartshorn Brook, and Purgatory Brook, south-flowing tributaries of the Souhegan River. The northwestern corner of town is drained by Lords Brook, a northward-flowing tributary of the South Branch Piscataquog River. The entire town is part of the Merrimack River watershed. The town&#x27;s highest point is on its northern border, at above sea level, near the summit of Storey Hill.

Mont Vernon is served by one state highway, New Hampshire Route 13, which runs north-south through the center of town connecting Milford and New Boston.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2020, there were 2,584 people and 945 households residing in the town. The population density was . There were 974 housing units, of which 29, or 2.98%, were vacant. The racial makeup of the town was 89.7% White, 0.7% African American, 0.1% Native American, 1.2% Asian, 1.4% some other race, and 6.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.5% of the population.

Of the 945 households in 2020, 30.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.0% were married couples living together, 14.0% had a female householder with no spouse present, and 10.7% had a male householder with no spouse present. 14.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. 23.0% of the population were under the age of 18, 6.3% were from 18 to 24, 20.0% from 25 to 44, 34.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.5% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45.5 years. Females comprised 50.12% of the population.

As of the period 2018-22, the median income for a household in the town was $156,667, the median income for a family was $171,429, and the median income for a nonfamily household was $84,167. The per capita income for the town was $63,344.

==Education==
The only public school in town is the Mont Vernon Village School. It is an elementary school, with grades kindergarten to six. For seventh and eighth grades, Mont Vernon sends its students to Amherst Middle School. For ninth through 12th grades, the students are sent to Souhegan High School, which is in Amherst but jointly owned by Amherst and Mont Vernon. Mont Vernon and Amherst comprise the school administrative unit SAU 39.

Mont Vernon had a private school that started as the Appleton Academy in 1853 and was renamed the McCollom Institute in 1871, which closed shortly before the turn of the century. The building was used as a public high school for a few years, and later became the private Stearns School, which operated from 1906 to 1937, when it closed its doors due to low enrollment during the Great Depression. The building was later used for a public elementary school and as of 2024 houses the police department and town offices.

==Fire department==
The former two-story Mont Vernon Fire Station, built in 1947, was located on North Main Street next to the Town Hall. This station had 6 apparatus bays. In March 2007 the town voted to raze the deteriorating building and replace it with a new fire station on the same lot. The new station has 5 apparatus bays facing North Main Street, and 1 bay facing Pinkham Avenue. The Fire Chief has his office in the station, along with a radio and report room, a meeting room, and an office for the Emergency Management Director. The station also contains maintenance, storage, and work rooms. Emergency medical services are provided by Amherst.

== Crime ==
Mont Vernon made national news on October 4, 2009, when a home invasion in the town resulted in the murder of Kimberly Cates. The case received significant coverage due to the crime’s brutality, since both victims were assaulted with a machete, the randomness by which the home was chosen with intent to murder (the victims and perpetrators did not know each other), the apparent lack of remorse, and the attackers ages of 19 and 17. The case also led to changes to New Hampshire&#x27;s capital punishment laws.

== Culture ==

The town has two major annual celebrations: On the last Saturday in September, it hosts &quot;Lamson Farm Day&quot; at a town-owned farm to celebrate its agricultural past. In late April or early May, it has a celebration of spring called the &quot;Mont Vernon Spring Gala&quot;. Both feature games, food and local entertainers.

== Sports ==
The town has two sports teams that compete regionally. They are the Mont Vernon Falcons basketball team and the Mont Vernon Acers volleyball team. Both teams are for girls age 9–12. The Mont Vernon Village School (grades K–6) has a basketball court and volleyball court. Adult volleyball has been playing on Monday nights at the school since the early 1990s. The town owns land near the school that has a baseball field with bases, fencing and two dugouts. The adjacent field is also used for many other sports.

<doc id="124779" wikidata="Q48274" url="?curid=124779" title="Nashua, New Hampshire">
<text>Nashua () is a city in southern New Hampshire, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 91,322, the second-largest in northern New England after nearby Manchester. It is one of two county seats of New Hampshire&#x27;s most populous county, Hillsborough; the other being Manchester.

Built around the now-departed textile industry, in recent decades Nashua&#x27;s economy has shifted to the financial services, high tech, and defense industries as part of the economic recovery that started in the 1980s in the Greater Boston region. Major private employers in the city include Nashua Corporation, BAE Systems, and Teradyne. The city also hosts two major regional medical centers, Southern New Hampshire Medical Center and St. Joseph Hospital. The South Nashua commercial district is a major regional shopping destination, lying directly on the Massachusetts border and taking advantage of New Hampshire&#x27;s lack of sales tax. It is anchored by the Pheasant Lane Mall and numerous smaller shopping centers.

It is one of several U.S. cities nicknamed Gate City, which references a reputation for being a travel gateway—in this case between the Boston region and New Hampshire. A number of civic groups and institutions have adopted the title.

==History==
The area was part of a tract of land in Massachusetts called &quot;Dunstable&quot;, named after Edward Tyng of Dunstable in England. Located at the confluence of the Nashua and Merrimack rivers, Dunstable was first settled about 1654 as a fur trading town. Nashua lies approximately in the center of the original 1673 grant. In 1732, Dunstable was split along the Merrimack River, with the town of Nottingham West (now the town of Hudson, New Hampshire) created out of the eastern portion. The previously disputed boundary between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was fixed in 1741 when the governorships of the two provinces were separated. As a result, the township of Dunstable was divided in two. Tyngsborough and some of Dunstable remained in Massachusetts, while Dunstable, New Hampshire, was incorporated in 1746 from the northern section of the town.

Like many 19th century riverfront New England communities, New Hampshire&#x27;s Dunstable was developed during the Industrial Revolution with textile mills operated from water power. In 1823, the Nashua Manufacturing Company was incorporated. The company eventually had four mills and employed approximately 1,000 people. The following year, the Jackson Manufacturing Company was incorporated.

In 1836, the New Hampshire half of Dunstable was renamed &quot;Nashua&quot;, after the Nashua River; the Dunstable name lives on across the Massachusetts border. The Nashua River was named by the Nashaway people, and in the Penacook language it means &quot;beautiful stream with a pebbly bottom&quot;, with an alternative meaning of &quot;land between two rivers&quot;. In 1842, the town split into two towns. Eleven years later, they joined back together under the name &quot;Nashua&quot;, and were re-incorporated as a city. During the split, the northern area, known today as &quot;French Hill&quot;, called itself &quot;Nashville&quot;, while the southern part kept the name Nashua.

Six railroad lines crossed the mill town, namely the Nashua and Lowell, Worcester and Nashua, Nashua and Acton, Nashua and Wilton, Concord and Nashua, and Rochester railroads.

Like the rival Amoskeag Manufacturing Company upriver in Manchester, the Nashua mills prospered until about World War I, after which a slow decline set in. Water power was replaced with newer forms of energy to run factories, such as coal, and cotton could be manufactured into fabric where it grew, saving transportation costs.

In 1922, it was affected by the 1922 New England Textile Strike, shutting down the mills in the city over an attempted wage cut and hours increase.

The textile business started moving to the South during the Great Depression, with the last mill near Nashua closing in 1949.

But then Sanders Associates, a newly created defense firm that is now part of BAE Systems, moved into one of the closed mills and helped restart the city&#x27;s economy. Sanders Associates also played a key role in the development of the home video game console market. Ralph H. Baer, an employee of Sanders, developed what would become the Magnavox Odyssey, the first commercial home video game system. The arrival of Digital Equipment Corp., now part of Hewlett-Packard, in the 1970s made the city part of the Boston-area high-tech corridor.

==Economy==
Nashua has three main commercial districts. Centered on Main Street near the geographic center of the city, Downtown Nashua is the oldest of the commercial districts, featuring commercial, entertainment, and dining venues, near historic commercial buildings and homes as well. Recent plans have incorporated the Nashua River into the design of a pedestrian-friendly walkway. The downtown Nashua Riverwalk is a large, public/private venture funded through the use of tax increment financing (TIF). Amherst Street (Route 101A) is in the northwestern part of the city and is a large thoroughfare with commercial centers along both sides. The South Nashua Commercial District, centered on Daniel Webster Highway near the Massachusetts border, is anchored by the Pheasant Lane Mall, attracting many people from Massachusetts taking advantage of the lack of sales tax in New Hampshire.

The city is home to a number of technical firms, including Nashua Corporation, which took its name from the city and river. Nashua Corp. was a leading producer of floppy disks through the early 1990s, making the Nashua name well known in the world of personal computers.

Defense contractor BAE Systems (formerly Sanders Associates), computer firm Dell, and software company Oracle Corporation are the largest representatives of the high-tech industry prominent in the region. The Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center is in Nashua. The three-building campus that once housed a Digital Equipment Corporation software development facility was sold to the John Flatley Company, which has renamed it &quot;Nashua Technology Park&quot;.

==Sports==

Nashua has had a series of amateur, semi-professional, and professional baseball teams. The Nashua Silver Knights, part of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League of New England (FCBL), is the city&#x27;s current team. The Nashua Pride, a Can-Am minor league baseball team, played at Holman Stadium from 1998 through 2008, then changed to the American Defenders of New Hampshire in the 2009 season. The Defenders were evicted from the venue in August 2009, however, because of non-payment of rent, and moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts to become the Pittsfield Colonials. Before the Pride, Holman was the home stadium for the independent Nashua Hawks; the AA Nashua Pirates; the AA Nashua Angels; and the A Nashua Dodgers, the first racially integrated professional baseball team in the 20th century. After minor league baseball began in Nashua in 1885, the team hosted the Nashua Millionaires franchise, with the team playing in the New England League from 1901 to 1933.

In collegiate sports, Nashua is home to the Rivier University Raiders, who compete in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC).

The local newspaper is &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, with daily news published online and a weekly printed edition.

Nashua radio stations include oldies station WGHM 900 AM (ESPN affiliate), talk station WSMN 1590 AM, and 106.3 WFNQ, a classic hits station owned by Binnie Media. WEVS 88.3 and 90.3 serve as the stations for New Hampshire Public Radio. The city is part of the Manchester radio market and can also receive almost all Boston-market stations clearly.

One television station is licensed to Nashua. WBTS-CD (channel 15) is owned by NBC Owned Television Stations, and serves as the NBC owned-and-operated station for the Boston market. The station moved from its own transmitter to a channel share with PBS member station WGBX-TV from their Needham, Massachusetts tower in 2018 upon NBC&#x27;s assumption of ownership, letting it broadcast the &quot;NBC Boston&quot; service (previously carried by a low-power station in Boston and subchannels of other stations) across the entire market. As WYCN-CD, it formerly carried a number of smaller networks, along with local programming and community calendar information of interest to Nashuans, until the sale to NBC.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Roads====
The Everett Turnpike is the major highway running through the city. U.S. Route 3 follows the turnpike from the Massachusetts border north to Exit 7E, where it branches to the northeast along the two-lane Henri A. Burque Highway to Concord Street and then heads north into the town of Merrimack. Other New Hampshire state highways in the city include:
* NH 101A, which enters the city from the northwest and follows Amherst Street to its terminus at Main Street.
* NH 111, which enters the city from the southwest and follows Hollis Street to the city&#x27;s eastern border at the Merrimack River, crossing into Hudson on the twin-span Taylor Falls/Veterans Memorial bridges.
* NH 111A, which enters the city from the southwest and follows Groton Road to Main Dunstable Road to its terminus at Hollis Street.
* NH 130, which enters the city from the west and follows Broad Street to its terminus at Amherst Street.

Maps of the Nashua area often show a stretch of freeway forming a circumferential highway through Nashua and the neighboring town of Hudson. Only a small section of the south end of this highway (Exit 2 off U.S. Route 3) has been built, and it is unclear whether the highway will ever be completed. If finished, the Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway would be part of the Everett Turnpike, and would rejoin the mainline highway at a hypothetical Exit 9 in northern Nashua.

In 2015, after four years of construction, the city completed the Broad Street Parkway, which connects Exit 6 of the Everett Turnpike to the city&#x27;s downtown area (&quot;Tree Streets&quot; neighborhood), with the goal of easing traffic congestion and opening up Nashua&#x27;s old mill-yard as part of the city&#x27;s economic development. The new parkway provides a third crossing of the Nashua River and a way for traffic to avoid Library Hill, a busy downtown intersection. The idea of a road connecting Broad Street with Hollis Street within the city had been discussed since the 1960s.

Public transportation is provided by the Nashua Transit System, which has nine scheduled bus routes in the city. Boston Express, a subsidiary of Concord Coach Lines, operates a Nashua-Boston bus line that runs out of the Nashua Transit Center off Exit 8 on the Everett Turnpike. This line transports passengers to South Station and Logan International Airport in Boston.

====Airport====

Nashua Airport (Boire Field), a general aviation facility, is in the city&#x27;s northwest corner. The nearest airports with scheduled airline service are Manchester–Boston Regional Airport in Manchester and Logan International Airport in Boston.

==== Past trolley ====
Historically, Nashua was a hub for the trolley system in New Hampshire. Trolleys could be taken south to Boston, as well as north into Manchester and to locations as far east as Hampton, New Hampshire. The trolley also connected different areas of the city, with the Nashua line ending at the city dance hall. The trolley system decreased in popularity in the 20th century, finally closing in 1932.

==== Future railroad ====
Efforts are being made to extend the MBTA Commuter Rail&#x27;s Lowell Line from Lowell to Manchester, stopping at Nashua along the way. The state legislature created the New Hampshire Rail Transit Authority (NHRTA) in 2007 with the goal of overseeing the development of commuter rail in the state. The proposed line would connect Lowell, Massachusetts, to Bedford, New Hampshire, with the end station being near the Manchester–Boston Regional Airport. As of November, 2022, an ongoing study by AECOM and the State of New Hampshire for design and financing is due to be completed by early 2023, and the project is awaiting federal funding. Nashua is proposed to have two station stops on the line, South Nashua, which would be located behind the Pheasant Lane Mall just north of the state line, and Nashua, which would be located in a rail yard near Crown Street in downtown Nashua and would utilize the existing Crown Street park-and-ride lot.

Separately on October 11, 2017 the Nashua Board of Aldermen signed a memorandum of understanding with the now bankrupt Boston Surface Railroad Company for the creation of a rail line.

===Firefighting===
The fire department of Nashua, Nashua Fire, has 176 full-time members and is responsible for , protecting a population of 91,322. In the city, there are six stations. There is one fire chief, one assistant chief, and four deputy chiefs. The department has six engines, three ladder trucks, one haz-mat/rescue truck (known as Special Hazards 1), two brush trucks, two spare engines, and one spare ladder truck. Nashua uses a private ambulance service, American Medical Response. The department has five fire commissioners. The commission has overall responsibility for the policy decisions, promotions, discipline, hiring and terminations. The fire chief reports directly to the commission. Their responsibility is to also work with fire administration with planning and prioritizing the department budget.

===Health care===
There are two hospitals in Nashua, St. Joseph Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Health System.

==Notable people==
==In popular culture==
An episode of MTV&#x27;s &quot;MADE&quot; was filmed in 2004 at Nashua High School North.

Russian dressing was created in Nashua by James E. Colburn, likely in the 1910s.

<text>New Boston is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 6,108 at the 2020 census, up from 5,321 at the 2010 census. New Boston is home to the annual Hillsborough County Agricultural Fair and the Molly Stark Cannon. The 1743 cannon, which appears on the town seal, was given by General John Stark to the New Boston Artillery Company after the Battle of Bennington.

The town&#x27;s central village is listed as the New Boston census-designated place, with a population in 2020 of 326.

== History ==

The town was first granted in 1736 by colonial governor Jonathan Belcher of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. At the time, lands to the west of the Merrimack River, disputed between the two provinces, were treated by Belcher as part of Massachusetts, and he granted the town to several Boston families. It was to have been called &quot;Lanestown&quot; or &quot;Piscataquog Township&quot;, but by 1751 they called it &quot;New Boston&quot; after their hometown. Not all the grantees took up their claims, and the land was regranted 10 years later to settlers from Londonderry, New Hampshire. When the town was incorporated in 1763, Governor Benning Wentworth formally recognized the long-used name of &quot;New Boston&quot;.

In 1820, the town had 25 sawmills, six grain mills, two clothing mills, two carding mills, two tanneries and a bark mill. It also had 14 schoolhouses and a tavern. The Great Village Fire of 1887, which started when a spark from a cooper&#x27;s shop set a barn on fire, destroyed nearly 40 buildings in the lower village. In 1893, the railroad came to New Boston, and farm produce was sent by rail to city markets. Passenger service was discontinued in 1931, and the tracks were removed in 1935. Today the former grade is the multi-use New Boston Rail Trail.

The town is home to the New Boston Space Force Station, which started as an Army Air Corps bombing range in 1942. By 1960, it had become a U.S. Air Force base for tracking military satellites. In July 2021, the facility was given its current name and began operating as part of the United States Space Force. New Boston was also home to the Gravity Research Foundation from the late 1940s through the mid-1960s. Founder Roger Babson placed it in New Boston because he believed it safe from nuclear fallout should New York or Boston be attacked.

Dodge&#x27;s Store, in the center of town, was established in 1872 and was owned and operated by five generations of the Dodge family until 1994. Clarence H. Dodge started the family business, and ownership remained in the Dodge family until Malcom J. Dodge sold the business in 1994 due to a downturn in the economy. The store closed on August 29, 2011, due to the owner&#x27;s financial problems, but has since been reopened under new ownership.

==Geography==

<text>New Ipswich is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,204 at the 2020 census. New Ipswich, situated on the Massachusetts border, includes the villages of Bank, Davis, Gibson Four Corners, Highbridge, New Ipswich Center, Smithville, and Wilder, though these village designations no longer hold the importance they did in the past. The Wapack Trail passes through the community.

== History ==
New Ipswich was granted in 1735 to 60 inhabitants of Ipswich, Massachusetts, whence the name is derived, by colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher and the General Court (Assembly) of Massachusetts. Settlement began in 1738, when Abijah Foster arrived with his wife and infant daughter. In 1762, Governor Benning Wentworth incorporated the town as &quot;Ipswich&quot;, and then in 1766 as &quot;New Ipswich&quot;. New Ipswich Academy, later renamed Appleton Academy after benefactor Samuel Appleton, was chartered in 1789, the second oldest in New Hampshire after Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter. It would also serve as high school for the nearby communities of Mason and Greenville.

The Souhegan River provided water power for mills, and in 1801, the first woolen mill in the state was established at New Ipswich, followed in 1804 by the first cotton mill. Other early factories produced glass, potash and linseed oil. Cabinet making craftsmen produced elegant furniture. The town&#x27;s affluence would be expressed in fine architecture, an example of which is the Barrett House, used as a setting for the 1979 Merchant Ivory film &quot;The Europeans&quot;, based on the novel by Henry James. Bypassed by the railroad, the early mill town was preserved.

In 1836, four families from New Ipswich moved to the Wisconsin Territory to start a mission to the Native Americans, founding the town of Denmark, Iowa.
In 1969, construction of Mascenic Regional High School was completed, rendering high school teaching in Appleton no more, although the building was still used to teach elementary schoolers and middle schoolers. In 1989 Boynton Middle School completed construction, so Appleton was from then to 2012 an elementary school. Appleton Academy closed in 2012, due to the dangerous conditions of occupying it.

In the past half century, a notable influx of peoples of Finnish descent, particularly of the Apostolic Lutheran Church of America, have settled in New Ipswich. Additionally, migrants from neighboring Massachusetts make up a large percentage of new residents.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.97% of the town. The eastern and central parts of New Ipswich are drained by the Souhegan River, a northeastward-flowing tributary of the Merrimack River. New Ipswich Mountain, part of the Wapack Range, is the highest point in the town, with an elevation of above sea level. On the west side of the Wapack Range, the northwestern corner of town is drained by the Gridley River, a northwestward-flowing tributary of the Contoocook River, which continues north to the Merrimack. The southwestern part of town, including Mountain Pond, Island Pond, and Binney Pond, comprise headwaters of the Millers River, which flows southwest into Massachusetts, part of the Connecticut River watershed.

Much of the town is made up of the wooded foothills of the Wapack Range. Secondary growth forests have reclaimed the vast majority of the pasture lands that dominated New Ipswich and much of New England at the beginning of the 20th century.

Muldoon Park offers many short walking trails, four variously sized baseball fields (ranging from t-ball to official), a soccer field, and a play area. Most of the trails lead to the park&#x27;s two ponds, local roads and houses or to Beaver Brook, a small river. The town of Pelham completed an 18-hole disc golf course here, stretching over a quarter-mile, in September 2007.

The Pelham Parks and Recreation department has recently added two non-official sized baseball fields to the southwest corner of the park.

There is now an 18-hole disc golf course at this park, that includes a spot to hold gatherings. Many players from surrounding towns enjoy a round of disc golf set in the woods adjacent to the sport fields.

<text>Weare is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 9,092 at the 2020 census. It is close to two important New Hampshire cities, Manchester and Concord.

== History ==

It was granted to veterans of the Canadian wars in 1735 by Governor Jonathan Belcher, who named it &quot;Beverly-Canada&quot; after their hometown, Beverly, Massachusetts. But the charter was ruled invalid because of a prior claim by the Masonian proprietors, who granted as &quot;Hale&#x27;s Town&quot; to Ichabod Robie in 1749. It was also known as &quot;Robie&#x27;s Town&quot; or &quot;Weare&#x27;s Town&quot; before being incorporated by Governor Benning Wentworth in 1764 as Weare, after Meshech Weare, who served as the town&#x27;s first clerk and later went on to become New Hampshire&#x27;s first governor.

In 1834, Moses Cartland founded Clinton Grove Academy, the first Quaker seminary in the state. A cousin of John Greenleaf Whittier, Cartland named the village where the school was located &quot;Clinton Grove&quot;, in honor of DeWitt Clinton, chief sponsor of the Erie Canal. The original academy served as a private high school. The complex, which included a classroom building, boarding house, barn and sheds, burned in 1872. Classes were then held in the Quaker meetinghouse across the common until 1874, when a new building was completed. It would serve as the Weare school district from 1877 to 1938.

On September 21, 1938, following several days of heavy rain, the New England Hurricane of 1938 passed through the center of New England. The additional rains from the storm caused the Deering Reservoir dam to breach, releasing a wall of water that rushed down to the Weare Reservoir dam. Although the dam held, the flash flood broke through the land at the side of the dam, releasing millions of gallons of reservoir water. The flood washed away everything in its path, leaving parts of Weare devastated. Many active mills were destroyed in the disaster.

In response to the disaster and seasonal flooding, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Everett Dam, as part of the Hopkinton-Everett Flood Control Project, which had been authorized by Congress to prevent a recurrence of the devastating floods. The overall project was completed in 1963 at a total cost of $21,400,000. The dam required the village of East Weare to be permanently abandoned, and formed Everett Lake.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 1.72% of the town. Weare is drained by the Piscataquog River, which is impounded by Lake Horace in the northwest and by Everett Lake in the northeast. Via the Piscataquog, the town is entirely within the Merrimack River watershed. The three highest summits in Weare form a cluster near the center of town. From south to north, they are Mount Dearborn, at above sea level, Mine Hill , and Mount Wallingford, approximately .

The town is crossed by New Hampshire Route 77, New Hampshire Route 114 and New Hampshire Route 149.

<text>Hard rock or heavy rock is a heavier subgenre of rock music typified by aggressive vocals and distorted electric guitars. Hard rock began in the mid-1960s with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. Some of the earliest hard rock music was produced by the Kinks, the Who, the Rolling Stones, Cream, Vanilla Fudge, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In the late 1960s, bands such as Blue Cheer, the Jeff Beck Group, Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Golden Earring, Steppenwolf, Grand Funk, Free, and Deep Purple also produced hard rock.

The genre developed into a major form of popular music in the 1970s, with the Who, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple being joined by Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, Aerosmith, Kiss, Queen, AC/DC, Thin Lizzy and Van Halen. During the 1980s, some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock. Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and hard rock reached a commercial peak in the 1980s with glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe, Bon Jovi and Def Leppard as well as the rawer sounds of Guns N&#x27; Roses which followed with great success in the later part of that decade.

Hard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of R&amp;B, hip-hop, urban pop, grunge and later Britpop in the 1990s. Despite this, many post-grunge bands adopted a hard rock sound and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.
==Definitions==

Hard rock is a form of loud, aggressive rock music. The electric guitar is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a high range, or even falsetto voice.

In the late-1960s, the term heavy metal was used interchangeably with hard rock, but gradually began to be used to describe music played with even more volume and intensity. While hard rock maintained a bluesy rock and roll identity, including some swing in the back beat and riffs that tended to outline chord progressions in their hooks, heavy metal&#x27;s riffs often functioned as stand-alone melodies and had no swing in them. In the 1980s, heavy metal developed a number of subgenres, often termed extreme metal, some of which were influenced by hardcore punk, and which further differentiated the two styles. Despite this differentiation, hard rock and heavy metal have coexisted with one another, with bands frequently flirting with the boundaries of, or hybridizing the genres.

==History==
The roots of hard rock can be traced back to the mid-to-late 1950s, particularly electric blues, which laid the foundations for key elements such as a rough declamatory vocal style, heavy guitar riffs, string-bending blues-scale guitar solos, strong beat, thick riff-laden texture, and posturing performances. Electric blues guitarists began experimenting with hard rock elements such as driving rhythms, distorted guitar solos and power chords in the 1950s, evident in the work of Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson, and particularly Pat Hare, who captured a &quot;grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound&quot; on records such as James Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Crop Blues&quot; (1954). Other antecedents include Link Wray&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Rumble&quot; in 1958, and the surf rock instrumentals of Dick Dale, such as &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&#x27;&quot; (1961) and &quot;Misirlou&quot; (1962).

===Origins (1960s)===

In the 1960s, American and British blues and rock bands began to modify rock and roll by adding harder sounds, heavier guitar riffs, bombastic drumming, and louder vocals, from electric blues. Early forms of hard rock can be heard in the work of Chicago blues musicians Elmore James, Muddy Waters, and Howlin&#x27; Wolf, the Kingsmen&#x27;s version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot; (1963) which made it a garage rock standard, and the songs of rhythm and blues influenced British Invasion acts, including &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; by the Kinks (1964), &quot;My Generation&quot; by the Who (1965) and &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; (1965) by the Rolling Stones. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. In contrast, hard rock was most often derived from blues rock and was played louder and with more intensity.

Blues rock acts that pioneered the sound included Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and the Jeff Beck Group. Cream, in songs like &quot;I Feel Free&quot; (1966), combined blues rock with pop and psychedelia, particularly in the riffs and guitar solos of Eric Clapton. Cream&#x27;s best known-song, &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; (1967), is sometimes considered to be the culmination of the British adaptation of blues into rock and a direct precursor of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s style of hard rock and heavy metal. Jimi Hendrix produced a form of blues-influenced psychedelic rock, which combined elements of jazz, blues and rock and roll. From 1967, Jeff Beck brought lead guitar to new heights of technical virtuosity and moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, the Jeff Beck Group. Dave Davies of the Kinks, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Pete Townshend of the Who, Hendrix, Clapton and Beck all pioneered the use of new guitar effects like phasing, feedback and distortion. The Doors&#x27; debut album, released in 1967, included songs like &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Twentieth Century Fox&quot;, and a cover version of &quot;Back Door Man&quot;, which were what music journalist Stephen Davis characterized as &quot;enough hard rock tracks&quot;. One track that stands out as especially heavy for its time is the last 1:10 of &quot;I Feel Much Better&quot; by the Small Faces, recorded in May 1967. The first 2:46 is typical psychedelic fare of the time, but then the song suddenly changes into a hard bass-and-guitar power chord with Steve Marriott&#x27;s rhythm guitar and gut bucket singing, equal to the heaviest rock to be heard later. The Beatles began producing songs in the new hard rock style beginning with their 1968 double album &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;) and, with the track &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, attempted to create a greater level of noise than the Who. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic has referred to the &quot;proto-metal roar&quot; of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, while Ian MacDonald called it &quot;ridiculous, with McCartney shrieking weedily against a massively tape-echoed backdrop of out-of-tune thrashing&quot;.
Groups that emerged from the American psychedelic scene about the same time included Iron Butterfly, MC5, Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge. San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a crude and distorted cover of Eddie Cochran&#x27;s classic &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, from their 1968 debut album &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot;, that outlined much of the later hard rock and heavy metal sound. The same month, Steppenwolf released its self-titled debut album, including &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, which contained the first lyrical reference to heavy metal and helped popularise the style when it was used in the film &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969). Iron Butterfly&#x27;s &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; (1968), with its 17-minute-long title track, using organs and with a lengthy drum solo, also prefigured later elements of the sound.

By the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like Led Zeppelin, who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; (1969) and &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; (1969), and Deep Purple, who began as a progressive rock group in 1968 but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, &quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot; (1970). Also significant was Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot; (1970), which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of Gothic horror. All three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal, but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music, with bands like Judas Priest following Sabbath&#x27;s lead into territory that was often &quot;darker and more menacing&quot;, hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant, good-time music.

===Expansion (1970s)===

In the early 1970s the Rolling Stones further developed their hard rock sound with &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; (1972). Initially receiving mixed reviews, according to critic Steve Erlewine it is now &quot;generally regarded as the Rolling Stones&#x27; finest album&quot;. They continued to pursue the riff-heavy sound on albums including &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1974) and &quot;Black and Blue&quot; (1976). Led Zeppelin began to mix elements of world and folk music into their hard rock from &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; (1970) and &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; (1971). The latter included the track &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, which would become the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio. Deep Purple continued to define their unique brand of hard rock, particularly with their album &quot;Machine Head&quot; (1972), which included the tracks &quot;Highway Star&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. In 1975 guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left, going on to form Rainbow and after the break-up of the band the next year, vocalist David Coverdale formed Whitesnake. 1970 saw the Who release &quot;Live at Leeds&quot;, often seen as the archetypal hard rock live album, and the following year they released their highly acclaimed album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, which mixed heavy rock with extensive use of synthesizers. Subsequent albums, including &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (1973), built on this sound before &quot;Who Are You&quot; (1978), their last album before the death of pioneering rock drummer Keith Moon later that year.

Emerging British acts included Free, who released their signature song &quot;All Right Now&quot; (1970), which has received extensive radio airplay in both the UK and US. After the breakup of the band in 1973, vocalist Paul Rodgers joined supergroup Bad Company, whose eponymous first album (1974) was an international hit. UK band Foghat also found success throughout the decade with their boogie and blues style. The mixture of hard rock and progressive rock, evident in the works of Deep Purple, was pursued more directly by bands like Uriah Heep and Argent. Scottish band Nazareth released their self-titled début album in 1971, producing a blend of hard rock and pop that would culminate in their best selling, &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; (1975), which contained the proto-power ballad &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. Having enjoyed some national success in the early 1970s, Queen, after the release of &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; (1974) and &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1975), gained international recognition with a sound that used layered vocals and guitars and mixed hard rock with heavy metal, progressive rock, and even opera. The latter featured the hit single &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;.
In the United States, shock-rock pioneer Alice Cooper achieved mainstream success with &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; (1972), and followed up with &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;, which reached the No. 1 position on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; albums chart in 1973. Also in 1973, blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album &quot;Tres Hombres&quot; and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar released their first album in 1973. Former bubblegum-pop family act the Osmonds recorded two hard rock albums in 1972 and had their breakthrough in the UK with the hard rock hit &quot;Crazy Horses.&quot; Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album &quot;Alive!&quot; in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1975) and &quot;Rocks&quot; (1976), Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 1960s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album &quot;On Your Feet or on Your Knees&quot; (1975), followed by their first platinum album, &quot;Agents of Fortune&quot; (1976), containing the hit single &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot;. Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album. In the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot; and the Runaways débuted with their self-titled album. While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. The Amboy Dukes, having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their psychedelic hit &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot; (1968), were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between &quot;Ted Nugent&quot; (1975) and his best selling &quot;Double Live Gonzo!&quot; (1978). &quot;Goodbye to Love&quot; by the Carpenters, a duo whose music was otherwise almost exclusively soft rock, drew hate mail for its incorporation of a hard rock fuzz guitar solo by Tony Peluso.
From outside the United Kingdom and the United States, the Canadian trio Rush released three distinctively hard rock albums in 1974–75 (&quot;Rush&quot;, &quot;Fly by Night&quot; and &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;) before moving toward a more progressive sound with the 1976 album &quot;2112&quot;. Also from Canada, Triumph released their debut album in 1976 before their breakthrough came in the form of the &quot;Just a Game&quot; album in 1979. Later, the band&#x27;s streak of popularity continued with the &quot;Allied Forces&quot; album in 1981. The Irish band Thin Lizzy, which had formed in the late 1960s, made their most substantial commercial breakthrough in 1976 with the hard rock album &quot;Jailbreak&quot; and their worldwide hit &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;. Their style, consisting of two duelling guitarists often playing leads in harmony, proved itself to be a large influence on later bands. They reached their commercial, and arguably their artistic peak with &quot;Black Rose: A Rock Legend&quot; (1979). The arrival of the Scorpions from Germany marked the geographical expansion of the subgenre. Australian-formed AC/DC, with a stripped back, riff heavy and abrasive style that also appealed to the punk generation, began to gain international attention from 1976, culminating in the release of their multi-platinum albums &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; (1977) and &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (1979).&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicAC/DC&quot;&gt;V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, &quot;All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul&quot; (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by a punk ethos were heavy metal bands like Motörhead, while Judas Priest abandoned the remaining elements of the blues in their music, further differentiating the hard rock and heavy metal styles and helping to create the new wave of British heavy metal which was pursued by bands like Iron Maiden, Saxon, and Venom.
With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK, hard rock&#x27;s mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade. Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held. Early punk bands like the Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock, with almost all of their songs clocking in under three minutes with no guitar solos. However, new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s. 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner, who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s. Midwestern groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock. In 1978, Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen. He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping, showcased on the song &quot;Eruption&quot; from the album &quot;Van Halen&quot;, which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion, while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar. In the 1970s and 80s, several European bands, including the German Michael Schenker Group, the Swedish band Europe, and Dutch bands Golden Earring, Vandenberg and Vengeance experienced success in Europe and internationally.

===Glam metal era (1980s)===

The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album &quot;Back in Black&quot; (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; (1981), began to return to a hard rock sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock, although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their &quot;Lick It Up&quot; album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, &quot;Animalize&quot;, both of which marked a return to commercial success. Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock, releasing four consecutive US Top Five albums between 1980 and 1983.

Often categorised with the new wave of British heavy metal, in 1981 Def Leppard released their second album &quot;High &#x27;n&#x27; Dry&quot;, mixing glam-rock with heavy metal, and helping to define the sound of hard rock for the decade. The follow-up &quot;Pyromania&quot; (1983) was a big hit and the singles &quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; and &quot;Foolin&#x27;&quot;, helped by the emergence of MTV, were successful. It was widely emulated, particularly by the emerging Californian glam metal scene. This was followed by US acts like Mötley Crüe, with their albums &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot; (1981) and &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot; (1983) and, as the style grew, the arrival of bands such as Ratt, White Lion, Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot. Quiet Riot&#x27;s album &quot;Metal Health&quot; (1983) was the first glam metal album, and arguably the first heavy metal album of any kind, to reach number one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; music charts and helped open the doors for mainstream success by subsequent bands.
Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s. After an 8-year separation, Deep Purple returned with the classic &quot;Machine Head&quot; line-up to produce &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (1984) which was a platinum-seller in the US and reached the top ten in nine other countries. After somewhat slower sales of its fourth album, &quot;Fair Warning&quot;, Van Halen rebounded with &quot;Diver Down&quot; in 1982, then reached their commercial pinnacle with &quot;1984&quot;. Heart, after floundering during the first half of the decade, made a comeback with their eponymous ninth studio album which contained four hit singles. The new medium of video channels was used with considerable success by bands formed in previous decades. Among the first were ZZ Top, who mixed hard-edged blues rock with new wave music to produce a series of highly successful singles, beginning with &quot;Gimme All Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; (1983), which helped their albums &quot;Eliminator&quot; (1983) and &quot;Afterburner&quot; (1985) achieve diamond and multi-platinum status respectively. Others found renewed success in the singles charts with power ballads, including REO Speedwagon with &quot;Keep on Loving You&quot; (1980) and &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight This Feeling&quot; (1984), Journey with &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; (1981) and &quot;Open Arms&quot; (1982), Foreigner&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot; (1981) and &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; (1984), Scorpions&#x27; &quot;Still Loving You&quot; (1984), Heart&#x27;s &quot;What About Love&quot; (1985) and Boston&#x27;s &quot;Amanda&quot; (1986).

Bon Jovi&#x27;s third album, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; (1986), mixed hard rock with a pop sensitivity selling 15 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three hit singles. The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1986) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit. This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986. Van Halen released &quot;5150&quot; (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States.
Established acts benefited from the new commercial climate, with Whitesnake&#x27;s self-titled album (1987) selling over 17 million copies, outperforming anything in Coverdale&#x27;s or Deep Purple&#x27;s catalogue before or since. It featured the rock anthem &quot;Here I Go Again &#x27;87&quot; as one of 4 UK top 20 singles. The follow-up &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; (1989) went platinum, but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato, &quot;it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of &quot;Whitesnake&quot;&quot;. Aerosmith&#x27;s comeback album &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (1987) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity. &quot;Crazy Nights&quot; (1987) by Kiss was the band&#x27;s biggest hit album since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK. Mötley Crüe with &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot; (1987) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with &quot;Hysteria&quot; (1987) hit their commercial peak, the latter producing six hit singles (a record for a hard rock act). Guns N&#x27; Roses released the best-selling début of all time, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987). With a &quot;grittier&quot; and &quot;rawer&quot; sound than most glam metal, it produced three hits, including &quot;Sweet Child O&#x27; Mine&quot;. Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s, such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums &quot;Pride&quot; (1987) and &quot;Long Cold Winter&quot; (1988) both going multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles. In the last years of the decade, the most notable successes were &quot;New Jersey&quot; (1988) by Bon Jovi, &quot;OU812&quot; (1988) by Van Halen, &quot;Open Up and Say... Ahh!&quot; (1988) by Poison&quot;, Pump&quot; (1989) by Aerosmith, and Mötley Crüe&#x27;s most commercially successful album &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; (1989). &quot;New Jersey&quot; spawned five hit singles. In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November, the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks; the albums were &quot;OU812&quot;, &quot;Hysteria&quot;, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, and &quot;New Jersey&quot;. A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s, and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s, among them Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse. Skid Row also released their eponymous début (1989), but they were to be one of the last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era.

===Grunge and Britpop (1990s)===

Hard rock entered the 1990s as one of the dominant forms of commercial music. The multi-platinum releases of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; (1990), Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; (both in 1991), Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;No More Tears&quot; (1991), and Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1991) showcased this popularity. Additionally, the Black Crowes released their debut album, &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot; (1990), which contained a bluesy classic rock sound and sold five million copies. In 1992, Def Leppard followed up 1987&#x27;s &quot;Hysteria&quot; with &quot;Adrenalize&quot;, which went multi-platinum, spawned four Top 40 singles and held the number one spot on the US album chart for five weeks.
While these few hard rock bands managed to maintain success and popularity in the early part of the decade, alternative forms of hard rock achieved mainstream success in the form of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK. This was particularly evident after the success of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991), which combined elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a &quot;dirty&quot; sound that made use of heavy guitar distortion, fuzz and feedback, along with darker lyrical themes than their &quot;hair band&quot; predecessors. Although most grunge bands had a sound that sharply contrasted mainstream hard rock, several, including Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Mother Love Bone and Soundgarden, were more strongly influenced by 1970s and 1980s rock and metal, while Stone Temple Pilots managed to turn alternative rock into a form of stadium rock. However, all grunge bands shunned the macho, anthemic and fashion-focused aesthetics particularly associated with glam metal. In the UK, Oasis were unusual among the Britpop bands of the mid-1990s in incorporating a hard rock sound. Welsh band Manic Street Preachers emerged in 1991 with a sound Stephen Thomas Erlewine proclaimed to be &quot;crunching hard-rock&quot;. By 1996, the band enjoyed remarkable vogue throughout much of the world, but were commercially unsuccessful in the U.S.

In the new commercial climate glam metal bands like Europe, Ratt, White Lion and Cinderella broke up, Whitesnake went on hiatus in 1991, and while many of these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s, they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s. Other bands such as Mötley Crüe and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands&#x27; commercial viability during the decade. In 1995 Van Halen released &quot;Balance&quot;, a multi-platinum seller that would be the band&#x27;s last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996 David Lee Roth returned briefly and his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, was fired soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album &quot;Van Halen III&quot; and Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; original lineup was whittled away throughout the decade. Drummer Steven Adler was fired in 1990, guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in late 1991 after recording &quot;Use Your Illusion I and II&quot; with the band. Tensions between the other band members and lead singer Axl Rose continued after the release of the 1993 covers album &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; Guitarist Slash left in 1996, followed by bassist Duff McKagan in 1997. Axl Rose, the only original member, worked with a constantly changing lineup in recording an album that would take over fifteen years to complete. Slash and McKagan eventually rejoined the band in 2016 and went on the Not in this Lifetime... Tour with them.
Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmith, with their number one multi-platinum albums: &quot;Get a Grip&quot; (1993), which produced four hit singles and became the band&#x27;s best-selling album worldwide (going on to sell over 10 million copies), and &quot;Nine Lives&quot; (1997). In 1998, Aerosmith released the hit &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot;. AC/DC produced the double platinum &quot;Ballbreaker&quot; (1995).&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicAC/DCOnline&quot;&gt;S. T. Erlewine, [ &quot;AC/DC&quot;], &quot;Allmusic&quot;, retrieved 20 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bon Jovi appealed to their hard rock audience with songs such as &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; (1992), but also achieved success in adult contemporary radio, with the hit ballads &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (1993) and &quot;Always&quot; (1994). Bon Jovi&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;These Days&quot; was a bigger hit in Europe than it was in the United States, spawning four hit singles in the UK. Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Load&quot; (1996) and &quot;ReLoad&quot; (1997) each sold in excess of 4 million copies in the US and saw the band develop a more melodic and blues rock sound. As the initial impetus of grunge bands faltered in the middle years of the decade, post-grunge bands emerged. They emulated the attitudes and music of grunge, particularly thick, distorted guitars, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound that drew more directly on traditional hard rock. Among the most successful acts were the Foo Fighters, Candlebox, Live, Collective Soul, Australia&#x27;s Silverchair and England&#x27;s Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres by the late 1990s. Similarly, some post-Britpop bands that followed in the wake of Oasis, including Feeder and Stereophonics, adopted a hard rock or &quot;pop-metal&quot; sound.

===Survivals and revivals (2000s)===

A few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers. Bon Jovi were still able to achieve a commercial hit with &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; from their double platinum-certified album &quot;Crush&quot; (2000). and AC/DC released the platinum-certified &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; (2000) Aerosmith released a platinum album, &quot;Just Push Play&quot; (2001), which saw the band foray further into pop with the hit &quot;Jaded&quot;, and a blues cover album, &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot;. Heart achieved their first hit album since the early 90s with &quot;Red Velvet Car&quot; in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), the Who (delayed in 2002 by the death of bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997–2006 and Dio 2006–2010) and even a one-off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous eras. Additionally, hard rock supergroups, such as Audioslave (with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (with former members of Guns N&#x27; Roses, punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland), emerged and experienced some success. However, these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The long-awaited Guns N&#x27; Roses album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum and failed to come close to the success of the band&#x27;s late 1980s and early 1990s material. More successfully, AC/DC released the double platinum-certified &quot;Black Ice&quot; (2008). Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success, branching into country music with &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;, and the rock/country album &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (2007). In 2009, Bon Jovi released &quot;The Circle&quot;, which marked a return to their hard rock sound.
The term &quot;retro-metal&quot; has been applied to such bands as Texas based the Sword, California&#x27;s High on Fire, Sweden&#x27;s Witchcraft and Australia&#x27;s Wolfmother. Wolfmother&#x27;s self-titled 2005 debut album combined elements of the sounds of Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. Fellow Australians Airbourne&#x27;s début album &quot;Runnin&#x27; Wild&quot; (2007) followed in the hard riffing tradition of AC/DC. England&#x27;s the Darkness&#x27; &quot;Permission to Land&quot; (2003), described as an &quot;eerily realistic simulation of &#x27;80s metal and &#x27;70s glam&quot;, went quintuple platinum in the UK. The follow-up, &quot;One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back&quot; (2005) was also a hit, but the band broke up in 2006, becoming active again in 2011. Los Angeles band Steel Panther managed to gain a following by sending up 80s glam metal. A more serious attempt to revive glam metal was made by bands of the sleaze metal movement in Sweden, including Vains of Jenna, Hardcore Superstar and Crashdïet. The Swedish rock band Ghost is among the most successful recent hard-rock bands, being nominated 4 times for the Grammy Awards, winning 1 award in the Best Metal Performance category for the song Cirice.

Although Foo Fighters continued to be one of the most successful rock acts, with albums like &quot;In Your Honor&quot; (2005), many of the first wave of post-grunge bands began to fade in popularity. Acts like Creed, Staind, Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback took the genre into the 2000s with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs. They were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown and Seether. Acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included Andrew W.K., Beautiful Creatures and Buckcherry, whose breakthrough album &quot;15&quot; (2006) went platinum and spawned the single &quot;Sorry&quot; (2007). These were joined by bands with hard rock leanings that emerged in the mid-2000s from the garage rock, Southern Rock, or post punk revival, including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Kings of Leon, and Queens of the Stone Age from the US, Three Days Grace from Canada, Jet from Australia and The Datsuns from New Zealand. In 2009 Them Crooked Vultures, a supergroup that brought together Foo Fighters&#x27; Dave Grohl, Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s Josh Homme and Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones attracted attention as a live act and released a self-titled debut album that was a hit in the US and UK.

<doc id="124806" wikidata="Q1022970" url="?curid=124806" title="Allenstown, New Hampshire">
<text>Allenstown is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,707 at the 2020 census, up from 4,322 at the 2010 census. Allenstown includes a portion of the village of Suncook. Just over one-half of the town&#x27;s area is covered by Bear Brook State Park.

== History ==
Allenstown takes its name from 17th-century provincial governor Samuel Allen. It was granted in 1721 but not incorporated until July 2, 1831. A part of neighboring Bow was annexed to Allenstown in 1815, and a portion of Hooksett was annexed in 1853.

Most of the town&#x27;s earliest settlement occurred in the eastern part of town along Deerfield Road, around the area now mostly occupied by Bear Brook State Park, and where the Old Allenstown Meeting House is located. Following the Civil War, the town&#x27;s population shifted from the east to the west part of town, centered around the confluence of the Merrimack and Suncook rivers, in the area now known as Suncook.

Railroads were instrumental to the development of Allenstown. First, the Concord and Portsmouth Railroad running from Candia and points east arrived in the 1852, but that line was subsequently torn up from Candia to Allenstown, with a new branch being built from the Suncook River down to the Hooksett Falls in 1862. The Suncook Valley Railroad would follow in 1869, which ran northeast along the river, first to Pittsfield and later, to Center Barnstead. While the Suncook depot was just across the river in Pembroke, the Suncook Valley Railroad built Allenstown another depot in the northern part of town, along what is now Verville Road. In 1902, the Concord &amp; Manchester Electric Railway came to town, connecting its two namesakes. It crossed the Suncook Valley track adjacent to the Catholic Church on Main Street; the Blodgett depot was built at that location to facilitate transfers between the steam road and the interurban.

Allenstown, at the junction of the Suncook and Merrimack rivers, proved a prime location in which to harness the Suncook&#x27;s power for manufacturing. The China Mill, the only large textile mill in the Allenstown part of Suncook, was built in 1868. At this time, a large number of French Canadians, mostly from Quebec, began emigrating to the area to work in the mills. Eventually, Suncook became one of many New England industrial villages known to locals as &quot;le petit Canada.&quot;

In 2006, Allenstown was hit hard by the Mother&#x27;s Day Flood. More than of rainfall caused the Suncook River to overflow, inundating homes, roads, and other low-lying areas. As a result of the flood, 14 flood-prone homes in Allenstown were bought out with federal money and demolished in order to avoid more flooding and evacuations in the future.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.55% of the town. The highest point in Allenstown is Bear Hill in the southeastern section of town, at above sea level. Allenstown lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed. The Merrimack River forms the western border of the town, and its tributary the Suncook River forms the northwest border.

Bear Brook State Park occupies in the central and southeastern parts of town, extending from the town&#x27;s northern corner to its southern corner. (An additional of the park are in the neighboring towns of Deerfield, Candia, and Hooksett.)

<text>Andover is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,406 at the 2020 census. Andover includes the villages of Cilleyville, Potter Place, East Andover, and West Andover, in addition to the town center. The town is home to Ragged Mountain State Forest and Proctor Academy, a private coeducational preparatory school.

==History==

Settled in 1761, the town was originally named &quot;Emerisstown&quot;. In 1746 it was granted to Edward Brown and others as &quot;New Breton&quot; or &quot;New Britton&quot;, having been granted primarily to soldiers who had taken part in the 1745 capture of Cape Breton during hostilities with the French in Canada. Among those soldiers was their regimental surgeon, Dr. Anthony Emery, a friend of Samuel Phillips Jr., who in 1778 founded the Phillips Andover Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. &quot;New Breton&quot; would be incorporated as &quot;Andover&quot; in 1779, the year Phillips Andover was completed.
In 1822, an academy was established in Andover, although it would close in 1828. Another school was founded in 1848 that would become Proctor Academy, the prestigious institution around which the town&#x27;s economy is based. Andover is noted for its antique shops, Greek Revival architecture, and two covered bridges. Potter Place Railroad Station, built in 1874 by the Northern Railroad, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and today serves as a museum for the Andover Historical Society.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.18% of the town. The central and western parts of Andover are drained by the Blackwater River, a tributary of the Contoocook River, while the eastern part, including Highland Lake, drains via Sucker Brook toward the Pemigewasset River in Franklin. Bradley Lake is in the southern part of the town. The entire town is within the Merrimack River watershed.

Ragged Mountain, elevation above sea level, is on the northern boundary. The northern slopes of Mount Kearsarge occupy the southernmost part of town and contain the town&#x27;s highest point, above sea level.

Andover includes the villages of East Andover, West Andover, Cilleyville, and Potter Place, named for Richard Potter, an African-American illusionist who lived there in the early 19th century.

<text>Boscawen is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 3,998 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The native Pennacook people called the area &quot;Contoocook&quot;, meaning &quot;place of the river near pines&quot;. In March 1697, Hannah Duston and her nurse, Mary Neff, were captured by Abenaki Indians and taken to a temporary village on an island at the confluence of the Contoocook and Merrimack rivers, at the site of what is now Boscawen. In late April, Duston and two other captives killed ten of the Abenaki family members holding them hostage, including six children, and escaped by canoe to Haverhill, Massachusetts.

On June 6, 1733, Governor Jonathan Belcher granted the land to John Coffin and 90 others, most from Newbury, Massachusetts. Settled in 1734, the community soon had a meetinghouse, sawmill, gristmill and ferry across the Merrimack River. A garrison offered protection, but raiding parties during the French and Indian Wars left some dead or carried into captivity.

On April 22, 1760, Contoocook Plantation was incorporated as a town by Governor Benning Wentworth, who named it for Edward Boscawen, the British admiral who distinguished himself at the 1758 Siege of Louisbourg. With a generally level surface, the town provided good farmland, and became noted for its apple, pear and cherry orchards. Bounded by the Merrimack and Contoocook rivers, it had abundant sources of water power for mills.

Industries soon included a cotton mill, a woolen factory, nine sawmills, a gristmill, a saw manufacturer and machine shop, and a chair and match factory. A mill town village developed at Fisherville (now Penacook), which straddled the river border with Concord. In 1846, the Northern Railroad was built through Boscawen, opening the following winter.

Sometime around 1846, the town&#x27;s postmaster became one of about a dozen in the country to issue provisional postage stamps before the official issue came out in 1847. The stamps were an adaptation of a postmark, simply reading , typeset in blue on a yellowish paper. These are extremely rare; in 2003, the estimated price at auction was US$225,000.

The 1915 Boscawen Public Library was designed by noted Boston architect Guy Lowell.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.50% of the town. The highest point in Boscawen is an unnamed summit at Raleigh Farm near the town&#x27;s northern border, where the elevation reaches approximately above sea level. The town is drained by the Merrimack River, which forms the town&#x27;s eastern border, and by the Contoocook River, a tributary.

The town is served by U.S. Route 3 and U.S. Route 4.

<text>Bow is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 8,229 at the 2020 census, up from 7,519 at the 2010 census, an increase of 9.4%.

== History ==

The town was granted by the authorities of New Hampshire to Jonathan Wiggin and others in 1727, and was originally square, covering nearly all the territory granted to Ebenezer Eastman and others by the authorities of Massachusetts two years previous, under the name of &quot;Pennacook&quot; (now Concord). Massachusetts claimed to hold authority over a large portion of the territory of New Hampshire for many years, until the final boundary line was established in 1741, giving New Hampshire more territory than it had ever claimed.

These complicated lines of the two towns coming from two different authorities were not settled decisively until after the final separation of the two colonial provinces. The government of New Hampshire gave Bow the preference in its grant of 1727, and did not recognize the title of the Pennacook grantees, and in the bill giving a charter for the parish of Concord, it was worded as &quot;taking a part of the town of Bow,&quot; etc. Although Concord was granted and surveyed before Bow, its final organization was 38 years after it. Bow gained a victory over Concord in its original title; still it was obliged to yield over two-thirds of its territory to Concord, Pembroke and Hopkinton, establishing their final boundary lines at different times, from 1759 to 1765.

The town&#x27;s name comes from its establishment along a bend, or &quot;bow&quot;, in the Merrimack River. The first census, taken in 1790, reported 568 residents.

In 1874, the Concord Railroad passed along the eastern border of Bow. It is now the New England Southern Railroad.

On September 28, 2019, hundreds of climate activists protested in Bow against Merrimack Station, one of the last remaining coal-fired power plants in New England. 67 people, who carried buckets signifying their intent to physically remove coal from the site, were arrested by state police.

==History==
Granted by Governor Benning Wentworth in 1765 to John Pierce and George Jaffrey of Portsmouth, it was settled in 1771 by Deacon William Presbury and family. Three years later other settlers arrived, several of them from Bradford, Massachusetts, after which the town was named &quot;New Bradford&quot;. Later, it was called &quot;Bradfordton&quot;, but upon incorporation by the General Court on September 27, 1787, it was officially named Bradford.

Parts of the town are hilly, but the largest portion is in a valley with varied soil. Streams provided water power for watermills. By 1859, when Bradford&#x27;s population reached 1,341, industries included one woolen mill, one sash, blind and door factory, one wheelwright shop, two sawmills, one gristmill, one tannery, and one clothing mill. In 1850, the Concord &amp; Claremont Railroad opened from Concord to Bradford, which would remain its terminus until the line was extended to Claremont in 1871–1872.

The Warner River and its tributaries drain the northern and central parts of town, while the southern part is drained by tributaries of the Contoocook River. Bradford lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.

The highest point in Bradford is an unnamed summit overlooking Ayers Pond on the town&#x27;s western border. Knights Hill () and Rowes Hill () constitute a large, hilly mass occupying the southern portion of town.

<text>Iatan is a village in Platte County, Missouri within the United States. The population was 69 at the 2010 census. It is within the Kansas City metropolitan area.

==History==
The community is said to derive its name from Iatan, a chief of the Otoe tribe who supposedly derived his name from battles with the Comanche who were sometimes also referred to as Iatan. The town site was platted in 1842. A post office called Iatan was established in 1855, and remained in operation until 1964.

Iatan, first settled by John Dougherty in 1837, was one of the first communities to be established after the Platte Purchase allowed white settlement on former Native American land (which was proclaimed in February 1837). It was initially an important trading port on the Missouri River but was soon overtaken by Weston, Missouri five miles (8 km) to the south and St. Joseph, Missouri to the north.

==Iatan power plants==
The community&#x27;s name is applied to the Iatan 1 and Iatan 2 coal-fired power stations for Kansas City Power &amp; Light which is the largest coal-fired generating plant in Missouri.

The Iatan 1 plant which opened in 1980 has a 651-megawatt capacity and had a high chimney when it opened. The tower is higher than any occupied building in the state including the Gateway Arch.

The Iatan 2 plant opened in 2010 and can generate 850 Megawatts with a capacity to burn 494 tons of coal per hour. The new plant has a lower high mechanical cooling tower.

<doc id="124823" wikidata="Q961380" url="?curid=124823" title="Moberly, Missouri">
<text>Moberly is a city in Randolph County, Missouri, United States. The population was 13,783 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Columbia metropolitan area and the 9-county Columbia–Jefferson City–Moberly combined statistical area that has 415,747 residents.

==History==

Moberly was founded in 1866, and named after Colonel William E. Moberly, the first president of the Chariton and Randolph County railroads.

Moberly, which gained the nickname the &quot;Magic City&quot; because of its explosive growth in a railroad boom, grew from the town platted by the North Missouri Railroad (later part of the Wabash Railroad) in 1866 to a transportation center with a 6,070 population by 1880. The North Mo. acquired the site when it took over the Chariton and Randolph R.R. after the Civil War. In 1860, the C.&amp; R. had planned a road west to Brunswick from this point on the North Mo. then reaching toward Iowa.

The Chariton and Randolph R. R. named its proposed junction for William Moberly, head of the railroad, and offered free land to residents of once nearby Allen to settle here. Patrick Lynch, who alone accepted, was given two lots by the North Missouri after the Civil War for holding the site without &quot;the loss of a life or a house.&quot;

Moberly has been a division point since 1867 when the North Mo. (Wabash) reached Brunswick. Huge railroad repair shops, one of the earliest railroad plants west of the Mississippi, were opened, 1872. The M. K. &amp; T. formed a junction here, 1873. Transportation facilities brought industrial growth and the development of the soil, fire clay, and coal resources of the area.

Moberly lies in a glacial plains area in a county organized, 1829, and names for John Randolph of Roanoke, Va. In Missouri&#x27;s Little Dixie Region, it was first settled by William Holman, 1818. William Fort boiled salt at a spring near Huntsville in 1820s/ The Bee Trace, a pioneer trail, ran along the Grand Divide (the high point in The Grand Prairie) between the Missouri and Mississippi through the county. The Iowa, Sac, and Fox tribes gave up claims to the region, 1824.

At Huntsville, county seat, since 1831, a plank road was built to Glasgow, 1854, and the 1855-82 Mt. Pleasant (Baptist) College was founded. County legal business has been conducted at Huntsville and Moberly since 1885. Moberly Junior College opened, 1927.

World War II Gen. Omar N. Bradley, first Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff and commander of the largest Army in United States history was born in nearby Clark, but grew up in Moberly and graduated from Moberly High School. Moberly&#x27;s airport is named for him. Moberly is the home of novelist Elizabeth Seifert Gasparotti and birthplace of writer Jack Conroy. G.W. P. Hunt, first Governor of Arizona, was born in Huntsville. Hancock L. Jackson, interim Gov. of Mo., 1857; Lt. Gov., 1857–61, and the biochemist Victor C. Vaughn, were natives of Randolph County.

The Missouri state Moberly Correctional Center was constructed two miles south of Moberly in 1963 as a minimum-security prison. As of 2014, it houses about 1800 minimum and medium security inmates.

On Independence Day, 1995, a tornado ripped through downtown Moberly. There were no reported deaths, but there was a large amount of structural damage. Another tornado hit nearby Renick on March 12, 2006. Four people were killed and thirteen were injured in the F3-level tornado. Dozens of homes were destroyed.

The World War II-era US Navy frigate was named for the town. The ship participated mostly in convoy escort, earning a battle star for her assistance in sinking a German submarine, &quot;U-853&quot;.

The Burkholder-O&#x27;Keefe House, Moberly Commercial Historic District, and Moberly Junior High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Government==
The city of Moberly was born of a railroad auction on September 27, 1866. The county incorporated the town in 1868 with a board of trustees. The same year that the Wabash Railroad, St. Louis &amp; Pacific Railway shops were finished in Moberly, the city entered a charter into state record and incorporated. At the time, there was no such thing as a council-manager government, but the 1950s saw the government form come into vogue in Missouri. Now, the city of Moberly has a council-manager government. The council consists of five members elected for three-year terms and one city counselor who drafts ordinances and acts as legal counsel. Each year, the council elects one of its members as mayor and one as mayor &quot;pro tempore&quot; to serve for one year. To manage the city and oversee day-to-day operations, the council selects a city manager. In 2024, the government had these officers:

===City Council===
*Brandon L. Lucas, Mayor
*John W. Kimmons, Jr., Mayor Pro-Tempore
*Mike Skubic, Councilman
*Chuck McKeown, Councilman
*Sarah Barfield Graff, Councilman

==Transportation==

Moberly is served by The Omar Bradley Airport. Commercial service is available 33 miles to the south in Columbia at the Columbia Regional Airport or the MO-X (an airport shuttle to and from STL and MCI), 60 miles to the south in Jefferson City via the Amtrak station, 45 miles to the north in La Plata via the Amtrak station, or 55 miles to the North in Kirksville at the Kirksville Regional Airport.

The city is served by U.S. Route 63 to the east on a bypass. The old route is designated as both Business 63 and Morley Street and goes through town. U.S. Route 24 goes through town as well. Route M (formerly Route 3) also skirts the edge of town. Other routes include Route DD (indirectly goes to Sugar Creek Lake), EE, A, and AA (past the prison). At one time there was a Business 24 that ran from Morley Street via West Coates Street to Johnson Street to Concannon Street turning North on Holman St to current U.S. 24. This route was de-numbered in the late 1960s. State Route 22 was also multiplexed with U.S. 63 to U.S. 24. When U.S. 63 was re-routed in the mid-1960s Highway 22 was truncated to its current end at U.S. 63 near Sturgeon, MO.

The Norfolk Southern Railway serves Moberly running west toward Kansas City, Missouri and east toward Hannibal, Missouri and points on. Norfolk Southern also runs south between Moberly and St. Louis, Missouri (via Centralia and Mexico, MO) and points on. Moberly was once the northern terminus of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad that ran between Moberly and Boonville, Missouri. Much of this route is still somewhat visible in satellite images.

Moberly is home to one of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s many rail yards. Norfolk Southern used to have a line that ran north from Moberly to Albia, Iowa, but it was abandoned in the spring of 1992. The line was reopened from 1993–1995 to help in recovery efforts after the great Flood of 1993. By 1997, the line was dismantled between Moberly and Moulton, Iowa.

The Centerville, Iowa-owned Appanoose County Community Railroad currently operates the section from Moulton to Albia, Iowa.

<text>Contoocook () is a village and census-designated place (CDP) within the town of Hopkinton in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,427 at the 2020 census. Contoocook is well known for its growth of small businesses, preservation of historical landmarks, community involvement and recreational activities within the village.

==History==

The village is named after the Contoocook River that runs through it. The name &quot;Contoocook&quot; comes from the Pennacook tribe of Native Americans and perhaps means &quot;place of the river near pines&quot;. Other variations of the name include the Abenaki meaning &quot;nut trees river&quot; or Natick language meaning &quot;small plantation at the river&quot;. In previous centuries the area was known as &quot;Contoocookville&quot;. It is the birthplace of Civil War naval officer George H. Perkins. His daughter Isabel Weld Perkins and his son-in-law Larz Anderson maintained Perkins Manor as one of several summer homes.
In describing the approach to Perkins Manor one commentator writes:

&quot;In passing up the Concord and Claremont Railroad from Concord, the observant traveler has doubtless noticed the substantial and comfortable-looking homestead with large and trim front yard, shaded by thickly planted and generous topped maples, on the right-hand side of the road after crossing the bridge that spans &#x27;Contoocook&#x27;s bright and brimming river&#x27; at the pleasant-looking village of Contoocookville in the northern part of Hopkinton.&quot;

<text>Danbury is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,250 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Danbury was first settled as a part of Alexandria, but mountainous terrain separated it from the rest of the town. In 1795, it was set off and incorporated, the name suggested by a settler from Danbury, Connecticut. The town later grew by adding land from Wilmot and Hill. Farmers found the surface mostly hilly, but with some good intervales suitable for agriculture. Raising cattle and sheep became the principal occupation. By 1859, when the population was 934, it had seven sawmills, two shingle, lath and clapboard mills, and one tannery.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.81% of the town. The Smith River, an east-flowing tributary of the Pemigewasset River, runs through the center of town, while the southwest part of town is drained by Walker Brook and Frazier Brook, south-flowing tributaries of the Blackwater River, which continues on to the Contoocook River. The northeast corner of the town drains east to Newfound Lake, which flows into the Pemigewasset River. The entire town is part of the Merrimack River watershed. Waukeena Lake, School Pond, and Bog Pond are a few of the bodies of water within the town limits.

The highest point in Danbury is the summit of Tinkham Hill, at above sea level, in the northern part of town. Ragged Mountain is a prominent mountain with multiple summits which occupies the southern portion of town and has a ski area of the same name; the elevation of the Danbury summit of Ragged is above sea level. The Sunapee-Ragged-Kearsarge Greenway hiking trail crosses a corner of Danbury along Ragged Mountain&#x27;s Ridge Trail. Access to the Ridge Trail from the SRK Greenway is on the SRKG 6.1 mile trail section 9, either from trailhead parking on New Canada Road in Wilmot from the northwest or from Proctor Academy&#x27;s trailhead parking in Andover from the southeast.

Danbury is located approximately northwest of Concord, the state capital, and northwest of Manchester, the state&#x27;s largest city. Danbury is the northernmost town in Merrimack County and lies within the Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee Region. The town is served by U.S. Route 4 and New Hampshire Route 104.

<text>Memphis is a city in and the county seat of Scotland County, on the northern border of Missouri, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 1,731. U.S. Highway 136 passes near Memphis, which is east of Lancaster and west of Kahoka.

==History==
Although the Missouri General Assembly organized Scotland County on January 29, 1841, the town of Memphis was not developed until more than two years later. County commissioners met at Sand Hill on May 15, 1843, to select the county seat. They chose a spot near the county&#x27;s geographical center and, after some debate, named it Memphis, after Memphis, Egypt. The name had been previously used by a U.S. Post Office that operated near the North Fabius River a short distance away.

Early settler Samuel Cecil donated about 50 acres of land to the county for the new town. After being laid out in town lots, the original plat of Memphis was filed in county court on October 11, 1843. A few homes had already been developed in the area, the first being a log cabin constructed in 1835 by Burton Tompkins.

Scotland County&#x27;s first courthouse, a two-story brick structure, was completed in June 1845 at a cost of $1,500. A decade later the county court declared the building unsafe. A second, larger courthouse was constructed in the middle of the town square in 1856 at a cost of $19,500. That building served the county well until the turn of the 20th century, but its small size made it outdated; it measured 40 by 70 feet. It was condemned in May 1905 and razed in early 1907. The current Scotland County courthouse was constructed between October 1907 and July 1908 at a cost of $50,000.

===Civil War===
Scotland County was the scene of two notable engagements during the American Civil War. On July 13, 1862, Confederate Colonel Joseph C. Porter approached Memphis in four converging columns totaling 125–169 men, and captured the city with little or no resistance. They first raided the federal armory, seizing about 100 muskets with cartridge boxes and ammunition, and several uniforms. The Confederates rounded up all adult males and took them to the courthouse. They had to swear not to divulge any information about the raiders for 48 hours. Porter freed all militiamen or suspected militiamen to await parole. He gave safe passage to a physician, an admitted Union supporter, who was anxious to return to a seriously ill wife. Porter&#x27;s troops entered the courthouse and destroyed all indictments for horse-theft. This act has been variously interpreted as lawlessness, intervention on behalf of criminal associates, or interference with politically motivated, fraudulent charges.

According to the &quot;History of Shelby County,&quot; which is generally sympathetic to Porter, “Most conceded that Col. Porter’s purpose for capturing Memphis, MO. was to seize Dr. Wm. Aylward, a prominent Union man of the community.” Aylward was confined to a house after being captured by Captain Tom Stacy&#x27;s men. Stacy was generally regarded as a bushwhacker; other members of Porter&#x27;s command called his company &quot;the chain gang&quot;. Guards claimed that Aylward escaped, but witnesses reported hearing a strangling. The doctor&#x27;s body was found the next day, marked by signs consistent with hanging or strangulation. Supporters of Porter attributed Aylward&#x27;s murder to Stacy, but questions remained.

<text>Franklin is a city in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 8,741, the lowest figure of New Hampshire&#x27;s 13 cities. Franklin includes the village of West Franklin.

==History==
Situated at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers that form the Merrimack River, the town was settled by Anglo-European colonists in 1764 and originally known as &quot;Pemigewasset Village&quot;. It was taken from portions of Salisbury, Andover, Sanbornton and Northfield. The name &quot;Franklin&quot; was adopted in 1820 in honor of statesman and founding father Benjamin Franklin. Water power from the falls on the Winnipesaukee River helped it develop as a mill town. It incorporated as a town in 1828, and then as a city in 1895.

Daniel Webster was born in a section of Franklin that was then part of Salisbury. There is a state historic site located off Route 127 that preserves the famous orator&#x27;s childhood home. As an adult, Webster owned &quot;The Elms&quot;, a farm near the Merrimack River along present-day Route 3.

In 1943, the Army Corps of Engineers created the Franklin Falls Reservoir above Franklin by constructing the Franklin Falls Dam for flood control on the Pemigewasset River.

<text>Chesterfield is a city in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. It is a western suburb of St. Louis. As of the 2020 census, the population was 49,999, making it the state&#x27;s 14th most populous city. The broader valley of Chesterfield was originally referred to as &quot;Gumbo Flats&quot;, derived from its soil, which though very rich and silty, resembled gumbo when wet.

== History ==
===Ancient history===
Present-day Chesterfield is known to have been a site of Native American inhabitation for thousands of years. A site in western Chesterfield containing artwork and carvings has been dated as 4,000 years old. A Mississippian site, dated to around the year 1000, containing the remains of what have been identified as a market and ceremonial center, is also located in modern Chesterfield.

===Historical communities===

The present-day city of Chesterfield is made up of several smaller historical communities, including:
* Bellefontaine (French for &quot;beautiful spring&quot;), or as the locals called it, &quot;Hilltown&quot;, dates to about 1837 with the arrival of August Hill. The first post office was established as Bellemonte (&quot;beautiful mountain&quot;) in 1851. Eighteen years later, in 1869, the town and post office name were both changed to Bellefontaine. Rinkel&#x27;s Market was a familiar landmark for years, at the intersection of present-day Olive Boulevard and Chesterfield Parkway.
* The town of Lake started out as &quot;Hog Hollow,&quot; in about 1850. The post office was established as Hog Hollow in 1871, but a year later the town&#x27;s name was changed to what some thought was the more suitable name of Lake. Zierenberg&#x27;s General Merchandise and Saloon (built around 1880) was a well-known landmark at the 18-mile marker on Olive Street Road. The original structure was destroyed by fire in 1918. It was replaced by the existing structure on the same site (Olive Boulevard and Hog Hollow Road).
* Gumbo is located in the valley at the present intersection of Chesterfield Airport Road and Long Road. A notable landmark (until it was razed in 1998) was the old Twenty Five Mile House - so named because of its distance from downtown St. Louis. Gumbo&#x27;s name derived from its soil, which though very rich and silty, when wet became gumbo mud. A substance very similar to gravel was made from Gumbo mud and used for streets and sidewalks in Forest Park during the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. Gumbo&#x27;s post office operated from 1882 to 1907.
* Monarch (earlier called Atherton, then Eatherton) was one of the settlements that sprang up along the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific rail line when it came through the valley in the late 1870s. William Sutton&#x27;s General Store stood on the northwest corner of Eatherton and Centaur Roads. Their post office operated from 1895 to 1907, when the mail was transferred to Chesterfield. A well-known residence in Monarch was named &quot;The Shadows&quot;; it still survives, with a commanding view from its bluff site.
* Bonhomme, which is French for &quot;good man,&quot; is located at the extreme western end of Olive Street Road. It had a blacksmith shop, grist mill, store, post office and Fenn&#x27;s saw mill; but it was all washed away in the late 19th century by the Missouri River. Bonhomme was a popular name in St. Louis County; with Bonhomme streets, roads, creeks, churches and townships still so-named. However, this Bonhomme is the only one that ever had its own post office.

===1967 tornado===

On January 24, 1967, a violent F4 tornado ripped a path of destruction across St. Louis County. It was the fourth-worst tornado to hit the St. Louis metro area and the most recent F4 tornado to hit the city. The tornado developed near the Chesterfield Manor nursing home and then moved through River Bend Estates and across northeast St. Louis County.

===Incorporation as Chesterfield===
The name &quot;Chesterfield&quot; was given by landowner Justus Post who arrived in Missouri in 1815 and began amassing an estate in the location of the present-day city. Post had grown up in Vermont, not far from the town of Chesterfield, New Hampshire, which sits on the border between New Hampshire and Vermont. Although Post eventually left Missouri and moved to Illinois, his chosen placename of &quot;Chesterfield&quot; stuck.

For many years, &quot;Chesterfield&quot; was an all-inclusive place-name for a vast, unincorporated sub-region of western St. Louis County (called &quot;West County&quot; by metro area residents) containing the unincorporated historical communities listed above, plus areas now incorporated as cities of their own (e.g., Ballwin). Police and fire protection in the community were fragmented and sporadic, the former provided by St. Louis County. As the population grew, Chesterfield Mall and other retail and commercial real estate developments sprang up; however, many residents were concerned about the lack of quality public services, and that the municipal sales tax benefited the county instead of the community.

An organization was formed calling itself the &quot;Chesterfield Incorporation Study Committee.&quot; Headed by its president, John A. Nuetzel (himself a former president of the River Bend Association, a zoning watchdog group), the members &quot;passed the hat&quot; at neighborhood meetings, engaged legal help, drew up metes and bounds, and forced several failed public votes for incorporation. After a number of years, in 1988, The City of Chesterfield was finally established by its residents and their families, and has thrived as perhaps West County&#x27;s premier residential, business, retail, and transportation center.

===Flood of 1993===

On July 30, 1993, the levee that protected Gumbo Flats (now known as the Chesterfield Valley) from the Missouri River failed. This was the first time the levee had failed since 1935. The town was told to evacuate, and the whole area of Gumbo Flats was flooded by feet of water. Today, the area has become the Chesterfield Commons retail area.

===Scientific history===
At the Chesterfield Village Research Center the first work on genetically-modified organisms took place, with the first genetically modified potato being grown on 2 June 1987.

==Geography==

Portions of Chesterfield are located in the floodplain of the Missouri River, now known as Chesterfield Valley, formerly as Gumbo Flats. Here several small creeks empty into the Missouri River (Caulks Creek and Bonhomme Creek). This area was submerged during the Great Flood of 1993; higher levees built since then have led to extensive commercial development in the valley. Chesterfield Valley is the location of Spirit of St. Louis Airport, used for corporate aviation, as well as the longest outdoor strip mall in America.

<text>Clayton is a city in and the county seat of St. Louis County, Missouri, and borders the independent city of St. Louis. The population was 17,355 at the 2020 census. Organized in 1877, the city was named after Ralph Clayton, a citizen who donated the land for the St. Louis County courthouse. 

==Geography==

=== Cityscape ===
The architecture of central Clayton reflects its economic activity and eras of growth. An impressive collection of mid-century modern low and high rise structures contrast with earlier mansions, stores and flats. Its surrounding residential neighborhoods maintain a dense, walkable character and were largely developed in the pre-war era. These neighborhoods consist of brick walkups, apartment buildings, mansions and modest single family homes centered around several small business districts.

=== Neighborhoods ===

==== Claverach Park ====
Claverach Park is a residential neighborhood bounded by Wydown Boulevard on the north, Ridgemoor Drive and Big Bend Boulevard on the east, Clayton Road on the south, and Audubon Drive on the west. The neighborhood was planned in the early 1920s by Julius Pitzman who avoided a traditional street grid in favor of curvilinear streets lined by stately trees, one centrally located neighborhood park, and 9 pocket parks. Oak Knoll Park, Clayton&#x27;s second largest park and the former home to the St. Louis Academy of Science, is located in the neighborhood.

==== Clayshire ====
Clayshire is a suburban neighborhood bounded by Forest Park Parkway on the north, Interstate 170 on the east, Clayton Road on the south and the Ladue city limit to the west and includes the subdivision of Tanglewood. Unlike Clayton&#x27;s denser pre-war residential neighborhoods, Clayshire is characterized by a more post-war suburban development pattern. Neighborhood parks include Anderson Park, Clayshire Park, and Whitburn Park as well as a pedestrian underpass beneath I-170 that connects to Shaw Park. There is a small commercial area at the intersection of Clayton Road and Brentwood Boulevard.

==== Davis Place ====

A large residential neighborhood, Davis Place is characterized primarily by single family homes with some apartment buildings along Hanley Road and Brentwood Boulevard.

The neighborhood is home to three of the St. Louis region&#x27;s six Fortune 500 headquarters; Centene Corporation, Emerson Electric, and Graybar. Additionally, the neighborhood is home to five of the region&#x27;s 10 Fortune 1000 headquarters; Advantage Solutions, Belden, Caleres, Energizer Holdings, and Olin Corporation. Commerce Bank, the Regional Business Council and the St. Louis Club are located here as well. Downtown Clayton is known for its many restaurants and cafes and hosts the St. Louis Art Fair during September each year. Recently, the neighborhood has entered a period of significant redevelopment and new construction with the opening of the Two Twelve Clayton and Ceylon apartment buildings in 2017, Centene Plaza C in 2019, and Forsyth Pointe in 2023. As of 2022, downtown Clayton had seven projects, worth approximately $600 million, either in development or under construction.

The boundaries of downtown Clayton are Maryland Avenue on the north, the University City limit on the east, Forest Park Parkway on the south, and Brentwood Boulevard on the west. The neighborhood is served by MetroLink via the Blue Line at the Clayton and Forsyth stations.

==== Moorlands ====
Like Clayton&#x27;s other urban, walkable neighborhoods, the Moorlands is characterized by large, pre-war masonry apartment buildings and single family homes with high-rise apartment buildings along Hanley Road and a small commercial district at the intersection of Hanley and Wydown Boulevard. Most of the single family homes are concentrated east of Glenridge Drive while most of the apartment buildings are concentrated to the west. The neighborhood&#x27;s boundaries are Wydown Boulevard on the north, Audubon Drive on the east, Clayton Road on the south, and Hanley Road on the west.

==== North Clayton ====
North Clayton is a dense, walkable set of neighborhoods that encompass all of Clayton north of Maryland Avenue.

<text>Hopkinton is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,914 at the 2020 census. The town has three distinct communities: Hopkinton village, mainly a residential area in the center of the town; Contoocook, the town&#x27;s business hub, located in the north; and West Hopkinton, within the more agricultural portion of the town. The town is home to the Hopkinton State Fair, adjacent to Contoocook village, and to the historic Contoocook Railroad Depot and the Contoocook Railroad Bridge, the oldest covered railroad bridge in the United States.

==History==

The town was granted by colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher in 1735 as &quot;Number 5&quot; to settlers from Hopkinton, Massachusetts, who renamed it &quot;New Hopkinton&quot;. First settled in 1736, colonists were required to build homes, fence in their land, plant it with English grass, and provide a home for a minister, all within seven years. The community was incorporated in 1765 by Governor Benning Wentworth, predating the establishment of counties in the colonial province. Built in 1789, the Congregational Church has a Revere bell. The state legislature met in Hopkinton occasionally between 1798 and 1807. In 1808, the town competed for the coveted position of state capital, but was defeated by neighboring Concord. Since 1823, the town has been within Merrimack County.
A substantial portion of the town in the north was named &quot;Contoocook Village&quot;, for a tribe of the Pennacook people who once lived there. Due to its position along the Contoocook River, it became a center for water-powered industry, particularly lumber and textiles. The Contoocook covered railroad bridge in the village is a remnant of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad and is the oldest covered bridge of its kind still standing in the United States. Next to the bridge is the Contoocook Railroad Depot, one of the original railroad depots for the Concord and Claremont Railroad.

Since 1915, Hopkinton has been home to the Hopkinton State Fair, an event which attracts thousands of visitors each year during the Labor Day weekend.

<text>New London is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,400 at the 2020 census. The town is the home of Colby–Sawyer College, site of the Gordon Research Conferences since 1947 .

The town center, where 1,266 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the New London census-designated place (CDP), and is located on a hilltop along New Hampshire Route 114 north of Route 11 and Interstate 89.

== History ==

In 1753, the Masonian Proprietors of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, granted the area now called New London as &quot;Heidelberg&quot;. Although it appears on some New Hampshire maps, the township was never settled, and the 1753 grant lapsed into default.

In 1773, roughly the same area was awarded as the &quot;Alexandria Addition&quot; to a new group of speculators, who had previously been granted the adjacent township of Alexandria. These proprietors were led by Jonas Minot of Concord, Massachusetts, but the others were Scotch-Irish immigrants living in Londonderry, New Hampshire. None built dwellings in the Alexandria Addition. Instead they recruited settlers to build roads, mills, schools, and a church—all increasing the value of their land holdings. Nearly all of the original settlers came from Massachusetts, either from the Amesbury area of the north shore or from the Attleboro area in the southeast. The township proprietors soon began a long, systematic process of subdividing and selling their properties at great profit.

By 1779, there were sixteen families recorded within the bounds of the Alexandria Addition, and they petitioned the General Court to incorporate as the town of &quot;New London&quot;—officially named after London, England, but perhaps also an acknowledgement of the Londonderry-based proprietors. The first town meeting was held on August 3, 1779.

In 1807, the northern half of New London was annexed, merged with an area called &quot;Kearsarge Gore&quot;, and then incorporated as the town of Wilmot, New Hampshire. In the early 19th century, there were three small additions to New London, including the village of Otterville in 1817.

===20th century===
In 1947, Colby–Sawyer College became the site of the annual Gordon Research Conferences.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 12.12% of the town. Several large lakes are in the town, including Lake Sunapee forming the western border, Little Sunapee Lake north of the center, and Pleasant Lake in the east. The western side of town, including Lake Sunapee and Little Sunapee, is part of the Connecticut River watershed, via the Sugar River. The center and eastern side of the town are part of the Merrimack River watershed, with the center draining south to the Lane River in Sutton and from there to the Warner River, and the eastern section draining to the Blackwater River. The Warner and the Blackwater are both tributaries of the Contoocook River, which joins the Merrimack in Penacook. The highest point in town is Morgan Hill, approximately above sea level.

The town is crossed by Interstate 89, which serves New London with two exits, and by New Hampshire Routes 11, 103A, and 114.

<text>Spanish Lake is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in St. Louis County, Missouri, United States. The population was 18,413 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
The Spanish Lake community is located in the northeastern portion of St. Louis County. The community is bounded by the Mississippi River to the east, the Missouri River to the north, Highway 367 to the west, and Interstate 270 to the south.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.13%, is water.

==History==
Spanish Lake, originally called Spanish Pond until the late nineteenth century, was named after the Spanish troops who stayed there while building a fortified post for Spain in 1768. Much of the area was once the property of James De St. Vrain, a brother of the last Spanish lieutenant governor of Upper Louisiana. It was in this district, near Spanish Pond, that an old log cabin, said to have been used as a government building by Lieutenant Governor De Lassus De St. Vrain, the last Spanish executive to rule this section, was erected.

Spanish Lake prospered in the nineteenth century, as a crossroads farming village came into being. The Bellefontaine Road area was settled largely after General Bissell relocated Fort Bellefontaine. Fort Bellefontaine was established in 1806 by Gen. James Wilkerson, governor of the territory of Louisiana. The fort served as one of the most important military posts west of the Mississippi River until the troops were removed to the Jefferson Barracks reservation in 1827. Traffic between St. Louis and the fort was busy; many officials had homes in both places, and visiting dignitaries usually went to both sites. The liveliest traffic was effected by the farmers riding back and forth to the city.

Spanish Lake became a well-developed neighborhood with the arrival of German immigrants. Farmland was intensely cultivated, and small businesses and industries sprang up around the intersection of Bellefontaine, Parker, and Spanish Pond roads, forming the village&#x27;s center. The Catholic parish of St. Aloysius in Spanish Lake was founded by, and for many years served as, a mission of Baden, located in the northern portion of St. Louis. The Bank of Baden played a large role in farm financing in Spanish Lake, and many county farmers also had business interests in Baden. The German dominance of the region was almost complete by the 1870s, and most of the surviving farm houses and outbuildings are associated with that era.

Spanish Lake was a rural farming community for many years, until the 1950s when neighborhoods of tract housing were built. The area became a rural refuge from St. Louis city and received an exclusively white population. The 1970s saw the proliferation of dense apartment housing to Spanish Lake. African-Americans fleeing the failed Pruitt-Igoe public housing high rises in the city moved into the apartments via the Section 8 voucher system which immediately struck racial tensions in the area, particularly in local schools. The 1990s saw a mass exodus of the white population, spurred on by blockbusting, a practice some U.S. real estate agents use to encourage white property owners to sell their houses quickly at a loss, implying the African-Americans moving into their neighborhood will depress their property values. This era of the city&#x27;s history is chronicled in the documentary &quot;Spanish Lake&quot;, although its depiction comes with some disagreement from community stakeholders.

<text>Northfield is a town in Merrimack County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,872 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

European settlers first arrived in Northfield in the early 1700s. Initially, Northfield was incorporated as part of Canterbury when that town was established in 1741. At the time it was a frontier town protected by a garrison fort erected on a hill close to Canterbury Center and commanded by Capt. Jeremiah Clough. Tradition has it that the first settlers of the &quot;north fields&quot; of Canterbury came from the scouts from this fort who patrolled the area in the 1740s.

The north fields of Canterbury prospered. Farming was the principal industry. Additionally, dams along the Winnipesaukee and Merrimack rivers and several brooks powered early sawmills and gristmills. By the 1770s there was a substantial population in the north fields of Canterbury.

By 1780 the residents of the north fields found it increasingly difficult to travel to the center of Canterbury to attend to town business. On March 30, 1780, they filed the following petition with the State of New Hampshire (spelling left as printed in 1780):

Canterbury, March 30, 1780

&quot;The humble petition of ye Subscribers Inhabitants of ye North part of sd Canterbury to ye Honorable ye President and members of Council and house of Representatives of said State. We your Humble Petitioners Living at a great Distance from ye Center of the Towne Some of us nine or ten Miles and Consequently at a very great disadvantage in joining with them all Publick Town affairs, being encouraged Partly by our Living in that Part of ye Town that was Laid out for what was called ye upper Parish and Partly by ye Kind Reception our Request met with which we made to ye Town for a dismission but more particularly by our Confidence in your Honors desire to Promote ye Happiness of every Part of ye State Humbly Pray that Honors would take our Case into your Serious Consideration and grant that we together with all those Live in sd Upper Part may be Erected and Incorporated into a body Politick and Corporate to have Continuance in ye Name of Northfield with all such Powers and Authorities Privileges Immunities and Franchises with other Parishes or Towns in this State in General hold Enjoy with your Petitions as in duty bound Shall forever pray.&quot;

The petition, signed by 43 residents, was approved by the state legislature, and the Town of Northfield was born.

There was a border adjustment to Merrimack and Strafford Counties on December 24, 1828, that affected Northfield and Tilton.

In 1848, the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad opened to Northfield, helping it develop symbiotically with Tilton across the river as a mill town. The Winnipesaukee River provided water power for mills, and by 1859, when the population was 1,332, Northfield had a woolen factory and a wrapping paper mill.

Northfield continued to combine a strong industrial base with a healthy agricultural community throughout the 19th and most of the 20th centuries. Early sawmills and gristmills gave way to large textile and paper mills. As these industries died out in the area, many old mill buildings were torn down. Others were used for the manufacture of other items, including optical lenses and lead batteries.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and is water, comprising 1.27% of the town. It is drained by the Merrimack River, primarily by way of the Winnipesaukee River and its tributary Williams Brook. The Winnipesaukee River forms the northern boundary of the town, separating it from Tilton to the north. The town is characterized by gently rolling hills, the highest point in town being the summit of Bean Hill at above sea level, near the southern border. Two significant water bodies in Northfield are Sandogardy Pond in the southwest corner of town and Knowles Pond on the east side of town.

The village of Northfield is located in the northern part of the town on the south bank of the Winnipesaukee River. Directly across the river is the village of Tilton in Belknap County. The two villages together comprise the Tilton Northfield census-designated place.

==Economy==
Today Northfield is the home of more than 70 large and small businesses. Its proximity to the robust commercial development in nearby Tilton has precluded the development of a strong commercial base in Northfield, but development in other sectors have provided Northfield with a strong and diverse economy. Manufacturers including Eptam Plastics, Blouin Steel Fabricators, Freudenberg NOK, and PCC Structurals form the backbone of the town&#x27;s manufacturing/industrial base. The service sector employs more than 400 people and constitutes 40% of the overall workforce.

Although many of the town&#x27;s residents travel to nearby commercial and business centers in Tilton, Concord or Manchester for employment, nearly a thousand people work in Northfield, according to the NH Economic and Labor Market Information Bureau.

Highland Mountain Bike Park is in the southern part of the town.
