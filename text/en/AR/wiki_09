It was named Shepardsfield Plantation, although early inhabitants called it Bog Brook Plantation. There was a farm settled in 1764 on what is now Sodom Road in Hebron before the Revolution and the grant to Alexander Shepard Jr. The first settlers of Shepardsfield Plantation were Captain Daniel Buckman and his family in 1778. Others followed, many fresh from the battlefields of the Revolutionary War. On February 27, 1829, Hebron&#x27;s southwestern half was set off and incorporated as the town of Oxford.

Agriculture was the principal occupation, with hay the chief crop. In addition, the town had fine orchards. The outlet of Marshall Pond, the largest body of water, provided power for mills. There was a sawmill, shingle mill, pail factory, blacksmith shop and shoe shop. In 1804, Deacon William Barrows, Jr. was instrumental in founding Hebron Academy. The town would be crossed by the Rumford Falls and Buckfield Railroad. The Western Maine Sanatorium opened at Hebron in 1904, the first of its kind in the state.

<doc id="116080" wikidata="Q3449210" url="?curid=116080" title="Hiram, Maine">
<text>Hiram is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,609 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of Hiram, East Hiram, South Hiram and Durgintown. Located among the rugged and unspoiled Western Maine Mountains, Hiram is part of the Portland-South Portland-Biddeford, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area.

==History==

It became a stage stop along the Pequawket Trail, the former wilderness path of the Sokokis Abenakis which runs from Standish to Fryeburg (site of Pequawket, their stockaded village). First known as Great Ossipee after the Ossipee River, the town was settled in the 1780s and organized as Hiram Plantation, named after Hiram I, the biblical king of Tyre. Like King Hiram&#x27;s domain, Hiram Plantation was set among forests. It was incorporated as a district on February 27, 1807, then as the town of Hiram on June 14, 1814. Peleg Wadsworth bought a tract of land here in 1790, and in 1792 or 1794 began clearing a farm for his eldest son.

Although uneven at the center, there was good and fertile farmland in the intervales. The soil was sandy loam, yielding wheat and hay, the principal crop. Sheep grazed the pastures, and their wool became an important product. In 1830, the town&#x27;s population was 1,148.

The Saco River and ponds serving as reservoirs for tributary streams supplied water power for mills, and manufacturing timber became an important industry. In 1859, town industries included a number of cooper shops, two blacksmiths, several shoemaking shops and a harness making shop. By 1886, the town had five sawmills and planing mills, producing short and long lumber, barrel staves and shooks. It also had two gristmills and a carding mill. Other products included men&#x27;s clothing, harness and slate blackboards. Described as &quot;a pretty village amid charming scenery,&quot; Hiram was a junction where the Bridgton and Saco River Railroad met the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad, which first opened service through the White Mountains on August 16, 1875.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Hiram is drained by the Ossipee River and Saco River.

The town is crossed by state routes 5, 113, 117, and 160. It is bordered by the towns of Brownfield and Denmark to the north, Porter to the west, Sebago and Baldwin to the east, and Cornish and Parsonsfield to the south.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Hiram has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Lovell is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,104 at the 2020 census. Lovell is the site of Kezar Lake, a resort area.

==History==

In 1774, the Massachusetts General Court granted New Suncook Plantation to the officers and soldiers (or their heirs) who fought on May 8, 1725, during Father Rale&#x27;s War against the Sokokis Abenaki Indians at Pequawket (now Fryeburg). First settled in 1777, the community had 85 inhabitants by 1790. New Suncook Plantation would be incorporated as a town on November 15, 1800, renamed after Captain John Lovewell, the fallen expedition leader.

The Kezar River provided water power for industry. In the 19th century, mills produced spools, long lumber, shooks, axe handles, ox goads, carriages, sleighs, , cabinet work and coffins, and boots and shoes. Good soil helped farms prosper. Following the Civil War, the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad connected to Fryeburg, and tourists discovered the beauty of Kezar Lake. Inns and hotels opened, and the town remains a summer resort.

In 2015 an estimated 100 year old wild American chestnut tree was found in a reserved forest in Lovell, on land bequeathed to the University of Maine Foundation. The tree stood 117&#x27; tall and a skinny 16.1&quot; in diameter. It is thought to be the largest American Chestnut in the United States.

With approximately 1,100 residents Lovell, Maine has two publicly funded libraries. The Charlotte Hobbs Memorial Library and the Lewis Dana Hill Memorial Library.

Charlotte Hobbs Memorial Library

The Charlotte Hobbs Memorial Library was opened in 1908 as the Lovell Public Library. In 1969 the Library Club dedicated Lovell Public Library to Charlotte Hobbs after her death.
In 1899 the Women&#x27;s Library Club of Lovell was founded by Mrs. Frank Swett and Miss Susan Walker, this was done due to the Maine State Library sending trunks of books as a traveling library. In 1901 the Women&#x27;s Library Club of Lovell was officially incorporated. 
Charlotte Hobbs was born in Lovell, Maine in 1879. She graduated Wellesley College in 1902, returning to Lovell after to teach, tutor, collect historical materials, and wanted to create a public library for the town. She was the town historian and served as the Lovell Public Library Librarian for more than 50 years. She put on and ran drama productions that helped raise funding for the Lovell Public Library. The dramas helped raise the funds to buy the land and construct the library building. The lot was purchased in 1906 after a fire destroyed the existing building, in 1908 the building was completed and the Lovell Public Library opened. Charlotte Hobbs was able to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the library she helped build in 1951. In 1975 renovations were able to be completed and paid for by the Charlotte Hobbs&#x27;s legacy. In 1976 the fundraising changed from drama series to an Arts &amp; Artisan Fair that continues to run annually. 2001 the Charlotte Hobbs Memorial Library celebrated their 100-year anniversary of incorporation. The next round of funds for renovations and expansions were raised with the help of author, Stephen King, who did a fan reading. In 2010 the newly renovated and expanded building reopened its doors.

The Charlotte Hobbs Memorial Library hosts many events, such as Author Talks, where they have many well-known authors speak to their community.

The Charlotte Hobbs Memorial Library has a collection size of 16,456 volumes and circulates over 21,000 transactions annually. The current director is Jennifer Dupree and the library is opened 6 days a week all year long.

Lewis Dana Hill Memorial Library

The Lewis Dana Hill Memorial library is a small library that is located in the old one-room schoolhouse in North Lovell, Maine.

The North Lovell Library was originally founded and opened in 1945, it was located across the street from the current location, in a room in the Kezar Lake Grange Hall and was a focal for the summer residents that came to the lake. In 1966 the one-room schoolhouse was purchased and the North Lovell Library was moved.

The North Lovell Library was renamed the Lewis Dana Hill Memorial Library after Lewis Dana Hill who was a summer resident of Lovell for more than 50 years. He was a Harvard graduate and frequented the library throughout his summers in Lovell.

The library is funded through public funds and many library fundraisers. There is an annual Fourth of July Book and Yard Sale, community breakfasts, and author lecture talks.

The Lewis Dana Hill Memorial Library functions similarly to when it was opened. There are no library cards needed, it is open to the public without it. Materials are checked out and managed using card catalog systems and sorted using the Dewey Decimal System. The one room is sectioned based on the materials. There is a small children&#x27;s section with stacks close to floor level for children to easily browse. WiFi was installed due to resident requests, but remains the only &quot;newly modern&quot; update to the library. The community residents enjoy sitting at the library to read their materials.

The Lewis Dana Hill Memorial Library contains 9,250 volumes and circulates approximately 1,800 transaction. The current director is Dennis Hodge. The Lewis Dana Hill Memorial Library is open two days a week in the off-season, when the population grows in the summer they are opened three days with expanded hours.

<text>Newry (; ) is a resort town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The town’s year-round population was 411 at the 2020 census. The town is best known as the home of Sunday River Ski Resort and has a proportionately large seasonal (winter) population. Newry was also the site of one of Maine&#x27;s worst Cold War aircraft crashes.

==History==


First called Sunday River Plantation, it was settled in 1781 by Benjamin Barker and his two brothers from Methuen, Massachusetts, together with Ithiel Smith of Cape Elizabeth. But the settlement was plundered in 1782 by Indians and abandoned. Then John J. Holmes of New Jersey purchased the land in 1794 with his sister&#x27;s surname on the deed: Bostwick. On June 15, 1805, Bostwick Plantation was renamed by settlers that had come from Newry in what is now Northern Ireland. The name Newry is an anglicization of &quot;An Iúraigh&quot;, an oblique form of &quot;An Iúrach&quot;, which means &quot;the grove of yew trees&quot;.

The trade route (now Route 26) from Portland to Errol, New Hampshire, completed in 1802, passed through Newry. Farms were established on the intervales, which had excellent soil. Hay was the principal crop. Slopes of the mountains provided pasturage for grazing animals. A sawmill and gristmill were built on the Bear River, and by 1870 the population was 416. Today, Newry is noted as the home of Sunday River Ski Resort.

===1960 KC-97 tanker crash===
At 20:15 on June 27, 1960, a United States Air Force tanker of the 380th Air Refueling Squadron departed Plattsburgh AFB to refuel a Strategic Air Command bomber. The Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter rendezvoused with the B-47 Stratojet bomber at an altitude of 15,500 feet in the &quot;Fighting Fox&quot; aerial refueling area over Newry. As the bomber maneuvered into refueling position, a lubrication failure caused the tanker&#x27;s outboard port engine supercharger impeller to disintegrate. Impeller fragments leaving the engine nacelle caused fuel leakage. The bomber observed ignition of the leaking fuel and broke away from formation. The tanker entered a gradual left turn, which became a spiraling spin as the fire rapidly caused structural damage to the port wing. Seven miles away, three hundred people at a Rumford Point drive-in theater observed the tanker spin down, with burning pieces flying off. The fuselage impacted a forested slope of granite boulders and caused a fireball seen fifty miles away in Lewiston. The port wing tip was found in Howard Pond, three miles from the crash site. There were no survivors from the tanker&#x27;s five-man crew. Wet vegetation limited spread of the fire, but fuel-covered trees were completely consumed and the five-acre hillside wreckage field was discernible for years amid the surrounding forest.

===Newry murders===

The February 23, 2012, episode of &quot;Sins and Secrets&quot; (season 2, episode 7, &quot;Newry&quot;) told the story of a series of murders that happened at a local B&amp;B in 2006. The convicted killer, charged in 2006 and now serving four consecutive life sentences, was a citizen of Newry.

===Lithium deposits===

Substantial lithium deposits were discovered in 2018 on the north side of Plumbago Mountain, which straddles Newry and Andover, Maine. Restrictions on extraction were being debated in the state legislature as of 2023.

<text>Otisfield is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. Otisfield is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. The population was 1,853 at the 2020 census. Otisfield is a summer recreation area and home to Seeds of Peace Camp and Camp Arcadia.

==History==

It was granted by the Massachusetts General Court on June 15, 1771 to James Otis, Nathaniel Gorham and other descendants of Captain John Gorham and certain members of his company who had fought in the 1690 Battle of Quebec. It replaced a 1736 grant which was ruled invalid when the line between New Hampshire and Massachusetts was redrawn to satisfy claims by the heirs of John Mason. Many early settlers were veterans of the Revolutionary War, with the greater number coming from Groton, Massachusetts. First called Otis Field Plantation, it was incorporated on February 19, 1798 as Otisfield. It then included nearly all of Harrison, set off in 1805, and a large part of Naples, set off in 1834. The town was part of Cumberland County until 1978, when it joined Oxford County.

The surface of the town is uneven with gravelly but productive soil. Farming became the principal occupation, with corn, potatoes and hay the chief crops. Mills were erected at various water power sites, with the first sawmill built 1812. Other industries included gristmills, blacksmith shops, a tannery, a pants factory and shoe shop, a cider mill and cannery for apples, a barrel factory, a shingle mill and a woolen carding mill. Today, Otisfield is largely a recreational area, with camps and summer cottages lining the shores of Pleasant Lake, Thompson Lake, Saturday Pond and Moose Pond.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Otisfield is drained by the Crooked River.

<text>Paris is a town in and the county seat of Oxford County, Maine, United States. Paris is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England City and town area. The population was 5,179 at the 2020 census. The census-designated place of South Paris is located within the town. Because the U.S. Post Office refers to the entire town as South Paris, the town as a whole is commonly referred to as South Paris. The main exception is the area known as Paris Hill, which is a scenic historic district popular with tourists. On May 30, 2019, the town declared itself to be a second amendment sanctuary.

==History==
It was granted by Massachusetts on June 11, 1771, to Captain Joshua Fuller of Watertown, Massachusetts and 59 others (or their heirs) for service during the French and Indian Wars. It was the second attempt to repay the soldiers, because their first grant in New Hampshire, made on November 24, 1736, and called Township Number Four, was deemed invalid because of a prior claim by the heirs of John Mason. The land in Maine would retain the name Township Number Four.

On November 4, 1773, when the Proprietors were lotting out the township, they held a meeting at Coolidge Tavern in Watertown Massachusetts and they voted that there be reserved for the use of the proprietors their heirs and assigns forever two rods in width on the eastward side of every range line through the length of the township for the conveniency of ways if it shall be needed, establishing rangeways to prevent landlocking and segregation in the township of Paris and West Paris.  

It was first settled near the center of the town in 1779 by Lemuel Jackson, John Willis and their families. Organized as Number Four Plantation, it was incorporated as Paris on June 20, 1793. At the establishment of Oxford County in 1805, Paris was designated its county seat and developed into a thriving community. It was noted for scenic beauty and excellent pasturage, including some of the state&#x27;s best livestock and dairy farms. It also had many large apple orchards. The village of Paris Hill was established at an elevation of above sea level, with views of Mount Chocorua and Mount Washington in the White Mountains. The Paris Hill Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, has fine examples of Federal and Greek Revival architecture. The old Oxford County Jail, built of granite in 1822, was given in 1902 to the Paris Hill Library Association, and is now the Hamlin Memorial Library and Museum.

The Little Androscoggin River provided water power for mills at South Paris, to which the town center shifted after the arrival of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad on June 8, 1850. Industries included a gristmill, sawmill, shingle mill, planing mill, iron foundry and machine shop.
In the 1890s, the county seat moved here from Paris Hill to be near the train station. Manufacturing would fade with the Great Depression, but South Paris remains the commercial part of the town. West Paris, which includes North Paris, was set off and incorporated in 1957.

The town&#x27;s name is believed to be borrowed from the city in France.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Paris is drained by the Little Androscoggin River. The town is located on a bed of pegmatite in which many semi-precious gems and rare stones can be found, including beryl, garnet, tourmaline, amethyst and smoky quartz.

Paris is crossed by state routes 26, 117, 118 and 119.

<text>Sweden is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. The population was 406 at the 2020 census. Set among hills, forests and ponds, Sweden includes the village of East Sweden.

==History==
This was once territory of the Abenaki tribe, whose main village was at Pequawket (now Fryeburg). Pequawket was attacked during Dummer&#x27;s War on May 8, 1725, by Captain John Lovewell and his company of soldiers. Lovewell was killed in the battle, after which the tribe fled to Canada for safety. Called New Suncook Plantation, it was granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1774 to the officers and soldiers (or heirs) for their services to the state. In 1800, the town was incorporated as Lovell after Captain Lovewell.

The southeast portion of Lovell (which would become Sweden) was first settled in 1794 by Colonel Samuel Nevers from Burlington, Massachusetts. He was followed in 1795–1796 by Benjamin Webber from Bedford, Jacob Stevens from Rowley, Andrew Woodbury and Micah Trull from Tewksbury, and Peter Holden from Malden. On the plan which accompanied the petition for incorporation of the southeast portion, it was labeled Southland. It was set off as &quot;Sweden&quot; on February 26, 1813. The surface of the town is somewhat broken, but had good soil for farming, particularly the cultivation of grains. Other industries included a sawmill that produced short and long lumber, in addition to shooks. The town also had a carriage factory.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. It is drained by Plummer Brook and the Kezar River.

The town is crossed by state route 93. It borders the towns of Waterford to the northeast, Lovell to the northwest, Fryeburg to the southwest, and Bridgton to the southeast.

<text>Waterford is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. Waterford is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. The population was 1,570 at the 2020 census. It is a recreation area noted for historic architecture and scenery.

==History==

The township was granted on February 24, 1774, by the Massachusetts General Court to Captain Andrew Gardner and his company of soldiers for services under Sir William Phipps during the 1690 expedition against Canada. It replaced a 1735 grant called Toddstown or Township No. 6 (now Henniker, New Hampshire), which was ruled invalid when the state line was redrawn between Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1741.

The land was surveyed in 1774; in spring of 1775, David McWain of Bolton, Massachusetts arrived with his dog at a lot he bought for $40. He cleared land and built a log cabin, returning to Bolton for two winters until he settled permanently at Waterford in spring of 1777. McWain preferred solitude, and was deeply annoyed when he first saw smoke rising about away at Paris Hill. &quot;Humph,&quot; he said, &quot;I would like to know who is settling over there right under my nose!&quot; Other grantees arrived nevertheless, most from the Massachusetts towns of Bolton, Harvard, Stow, Northborough and Rowley. Indeed, the northwestern part of the plantation was once known as Rowley after the inhabitants&#x27; former hometown.

On March 2, 1797, Waterford was incorporated, with land annexed from Albany in 1811. The surface of the town is uneven and somewhat mountainous. It was well-suited for pasturage and orchards, and agriculture became a principal occupation. Sawmills were built at streams to manufacture the region&#x27;s abundant timber into lumber. Wood products included window sashes, barrel staves, salt boxes and buckets. There was also a gristmill, carriage factory and tannery. Today, Waterford Flat is a resort area, and home to The Lake House, a 1797 inn set among antique buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Waterford is drained by the Crooked River. It contains a number of small lakes including Keoka Lake, McWain Pond, Bear Pond, as well as Mount Tire&#x27;m.

The town is traversed by state routes 35, 37 and 118. It is bordered by the towns of Norway to the northeast, Albany and Stoneham to the northwest, Sweden and Lovell to the southwest, and Harrison and Bridgton to the southeast.

<text>West Paris is a town in Oxford County, Maine, United States. Originally settled in 1771 for land that what was deemed &quot;superior for pasturage, hay crops, and orchards&quot;, West Paris became a center of Finnish (, ) immigrant settlement in the 19th century, with many if the town&#x27;s current residents being descendants of the original Finnish settlers. Once part of the neighboring town of Paris, Maine, West Paris seceded from Paris and was incorporated in September 1957. The population was 1,766 at the 2020 census.

==History==

It began as part of Paris, granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1771 to Captain Joshua Fuller and his company of 64 soldiers as payment for their service to the colony. First settled in 1779, the land was considered superior for pasturage and hay crops, and orchards were large and productive. Mills were built along the Little Androscoggin River. The Paris Manufacturing Company, which was started modestly by Henry Franklin Morton in 1861 at West Sumner, grew into an important manufacturer. Near the Grand Trunk Railway depot in West Paris, it built a factory to make products including sleds, skis, wagons, step ladders, wheelbarrows, ironing boards, children&#x27;s rolltop desks and other furniture.

On November 4, 1773, when the Proprietors were lotting out the township, they held a meeting at Coolidge Tavern in Watertown, Massachusetts and they voted that there be reserved for the use of the proprietors their heirs and assigns forever two rods in width on the eastward side of every range line through the length of the township for the conveniency of ways if it shall be needed, establishing rangeways to prevent landlocking and segregation in the township of Paris and West Paris.

In September 1957, West Paris was set off and incorporated as a town.

<doc id="116100" wikidata="Q327012" url="?curid=116100" title="Bangor, Maine">
<text>Bangor ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The city proper has a population of 31,753, making it the state&#x27;s third-most populous city, behind Portland (68,408) and Lewiston (37,121). Bangor is known as the &quot;Queen City.&quot;

Modern Bangor was established in the mid-19th century with the lumber and shipbuilding industries. Lying on the Penobscot River, logs could be floated downstream from the Maine North Woods and processed at the city&#x27;s water-powered sawmills, then shipped from Bangor&#x27;s port to the Atlantic Ocean downstream, and from there to any port in the world. Evidence of this is still visible in the lumber barons&#x27; elaborate Greek Revival and Victorian mansions and the 31-foot-high (9.4 m) statue of Paul Bunyan. Today, Bangor&#x27;s economy is based on services and retail, healthcare, and education.

Bangor has a port of entry at Bangor International Airport, also home to the Bangor Air National Guard Base. Historically Bangor was an important stopover on the Great Circle Air Route between the U.S. East Coast and Europe.

==Name and pronunciation==
Founded as Kenduskeag Plantation in 1791, Bangor was incorporated as a town in 1834. The name Bangor is said to have been taken from a Welsh hymn tune. it is also the name of Bangor, Gwynedd, the oldest city in Wales. 

The final syllable is pronounced &quot;gor&quot;. In 2015, local celebrities and business owners recorded the YouTube video &quot;How to Say Bangor&quot;, which was sung to the tune of &quot;We Are the World&quot;.

==History==
===European settlement===
The Penobscot people have inhabited the area around present-day Bangor for at least 11,000 years and still occupy tribal land on the nearby Penobscot Indian Island Reservation. They practised some agriculture, but less than peoples in southern New England where the climate is milder, and subsisted on what they could hunt and gather. Contact with Europeans was not uncommon during the 1500s because the fur trade was lucrative and the Penobscot were willing to trade pelts for European goods. The first European known to have explored the area in 1524 was Estêvão Gomes, a Portuguese navigator who sailed in the service of Spain in the 1520s. The Spaniards, led by Gómez, were the first Europeans to make landfall in what is now Maine, followed by the Frenchman Samuel de Champlain in 1605. The Jesuits established a mission on Penobscot Bay in 1609, which was then part of the French colony of Acadia, and the valley remained contested between France and Britain into the 1750s, making it one of the last regions to become part of New England.

In 1769, Jacob Buswell founded a settlement at the site. By 1772, there were 12 families, along with a sawmill, store, and school. By 1787, the population was 567. It was known as Sunbury or Kenduskeag Plantation until incorporation as Bangor in 1791.

===Wars of Independence, 1812, and Civil War===

In 1779, the rebel Penobscot Expedition fled up the Penobscot River and ten of its ships were scuttled by the British fleet at Bangor. The ships remained there until the late 1950s, when construction of the Joshua Chamberlain Bridge disturbed the site. Six cannons were removed from the riverbed, five of which are on display throughout the region (one was thrown back into the river by area residents angered that the archeological site was destroyed for the bridge&#x27;s construction).

During the War of 1812, Bangor was briefly occupied in 1814 by British forces under Robert Barrie after the Battle of Hampden.

Maine was part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts until 1820 when it voted to secede from Massachusetts and was admitted to the Union as the 23rd state under the Missouri Compromise.

In 1861, a mob ransacked the offices of the Democratic newspaper the &quot;Bangor Daily Union&quot;, threw the presses and other materials into the street and burned them. Editor Marcellus Emery, who was sympathetic to the South, escaped unharmed but only resumed publishing after the war.

During the American Civil War the locally mustered 2nd Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment was the first to march out of Maine in 1861, and played a prominent part in the First Battle of Bull Run. The 1st Maine Heavy Artillery Regiment, mustered in Bangor and commanded by a local merchant, lost more men than any other Union regiment in the war (especially in the Second Battle of Petersburg, 1864). The 20th Maine Infantry Regiment held Little Round Top in the Battle of Gettysburg. A bridge connecting Bangor with Brewer is named for Joshua Chamberlain, the regiment&#x27;s leader and one of eight Civil War soldiers from Penobscot County towns to receive the Medal of Honor. Bangor&#x27;s Charles A. Boutelle accepted the surrender of the Confederate fleet after the Battle of Mobile Bay. A Bangor residential street is named for him. The Confederate States Navy captured several Bangor ships during the Civil War.

Bangor was near the lands disputed during the Aroostook War, a boundary dispute with Britain in 1838–1839. The passion of the Aroostook War signaled the increasing role lumbering and logging played in the Maine economy, particularly in the state&#x27;s central and eastern sections. Bangor arose as a lumbering boom-town in the 1830s, and a potential demographic and political rival to Portland. Bangor became for a time the largest lumber port in the world, and the site of furious land speculation that extended up the Penobscot River valley and beyond.

===Industrialization: lumbering, shipping, and manufacturing===
The Penobscot River drainage basin above Bangor was unattractive to settlement for farming, but well suited to lumbering. Winter snow allowed logs to be dragged from the woods by horse-teams. Carried to the Penobscot or its tributaries, log driving in the snowmelt brought them to waterfall-powered sawmills upriver from Bangor. The sawed lumber was then shipped from the city&#x27;s docks, Bangor being at the head-of-tide (between the rapids and the ocean) to points anywhere in the world. Shipbuilding was also developed. Bangor capitalists also owned most of the forests. The main markets for Bangor lumber were the East Coast cities. Much was also shipped to the Caribbean and to California during the Gold Rush, via Cape Horn, before sawmills could be established in the west. Bangorians later helped transplant the Maine culture of lumbering to the Pacific Northwest, and participated directly in the Gold Rush. Bangor, Washington; Bangor, California; and Little Bangor, Nevada, are legacies of this contact.

By 1860, Bangor was the world&#x27;s largest lumber port, with 150 sawmills operating along the river. The city shipped over 150 million boardfeet of lumber a year, much of it in Bangor-built and Bangor-owned ships. In the year 1860, 3,300 lumbering ships passed by the docks.

Many of the lumber barons built elaborate Greek Revival and Victorian houses that still stand in the Broadway Historic District. Bangor has many substantial old churches, and shade trees. The city was so beautiful it was called &quot;The Queen City of the East&quot;. The shorter &quot;Queen City&quot; appellation is still used by some local clubs, organizations, events and businesses.

In addition to shipping lumber, 19th-century Bangor was the leading producer of moccasins, shipping over 100,000 pairs a year by the 1880s. Exports also included bricks, leather, and even ice (which was cut and stored in winter, then shipped to Boston, and even China, the West Indies and South America).

Bangor had certain disadvantages compared to other East Coast ports, including its rival Portland, Maine. Being on a northern river, its port froze during the winter, and it could not take the largest ocean-going ships. The comparative lack of settlement in the forested hinterland also gave it a comparatively small home market.

In 1844 the first ocean-going iron-hulled steamship in the U.S. was named &quot;The Bangor&quot;. She was built by the Harlan and Hollingsworth firm of Wilmington, Delaware in 1844, and was intended to take passengers between Bangor and Boston. On her second voyage, however, in 1845, she burned to the waterline off Castine. She was rebuilt at Bath, returned briefly to her earlier route, but was soon purchased by the U.S. government for use in the Mexican–American War.

===Modern era===
Bangor continued to prosper as the pulp and paper industry replaced lumbering, and railroads replaced shipping. Local capitalists also invested in a train route to Aroostook County in northern Maine (the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad), opening that area to settlement.

Bangor&#x27;s Hinkley &amp; Egery Ironworks (later Union Ironworks) was a local center for invention in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A new type of steam engine built there, named the &quot;Endeavor&quot;, won a gold medal at the New York Crystal Palace Exhibition of the American Institute in 1856. The firm won a diploma for a shingle-making machine the following year. In the 1920s, Union Iron Works engineer Don A. Sargent invented the first automotive snow plow. Sargent patented the device and the firm manufactured it for a national market.

==Geography==
Bangor is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

A potential advantage that has always eluded exploitation is the city&#x27;s location between the port city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the rest of Canada (as well as New York). As early as the 1870s, the city promoted a Halifax-to-New York railroad, via Bangor, as the quickest connection between North America and Europe (when combined with steamship service between Britain and Halifax). A European and North American Railway opened through Bangor, with President Ulysses S. Grant officiating at the inauguration, but commerce never lived up to the potential. More recent attempts to capture traffic between Halifax and Montreal by constructing an East–West Highway through Maine have also come to naught. Most overland traffic between the two parts of Canada continues to travel north of Maine rather than across it.

===Urban development===
====Fires====
Major fires struck the downtown in 1856, 1869, and 1872, the last resulting in the erection of the Adams-Pickering Block. In the Great Fire of 1911 Bangor lost its high school, post office &amp; custom house, public library, telephone and telegraph companies, banks, two fire stations, nearly a hundred businesses, six churches, and synagogue and 285 private residences over a total of 55 acres (23 ha.) The area was rebuilt, and in the process became a showplace for a diverse range of architectural styles, including the Mansard style, Beaux Arts, Greek Revival and Colonial Revival, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Great Fire of 1911 Historic District.

====Urban renewal====
The destruction of downtown landmarks such as the old city hall and train station in the late 1960s urban renewal program is now considered to have been a mistake. It ushered in a decline of the city center that was accelerated by the construction of the Bangor Mall in 1978 and subsequent big-box stores on the city&#x27;s outskirts. Downtown Bangor began to recover in the 1990s, with bookstores, café/restaurants, galleries, and museums filling once-vacant storefronts. The recent re-development of the city&#x27;s waterfront has also helped re-focus cultural life in the historic center.

===Hydrology===

Bangor is on the banks of the Penobscot River, close enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be influenced by tides. Upstream, the Penobscot River drainage basin occupies in northeastern Maine. Flooding is most often caused by a combination of precipitation and snowmelt. Ice jams can exacerbate high flow conditions and cause acute localized flooding. Conditions favorable for flooding typically occur during the spring months.

In 1807 an ice jam formed below Bangor Village, raising the water 10 to 12 feet (3 to 3.7 m) above the normal highwater mark and in 1887 the freshet caused the Maine Central Railroad Company rails between Bangor and Vanceboro to be covered to a depth of several feet. Bangor&#x27;s worst ice jam floods occurred in 1846 and 1902. Both resulted from mid-December freshets that cleared the upper river of ice, followed by cold that produced large volumes of frazil ice or slush which was carried by high flows forming a major ice jam in the lower river. In March of both years, a dynamic breakup of ice ran into the jam and flooded downtown Bangor. Though no people died and the city recovered quickly, the 1846 and 1902 ice jam floods were economically devastating, according to the Army Corps analysis. Both floods occurred with multiple dams in place and little to no ice-breaking in the lower river. The United States Coast Guard began icebreaker operations on the Penobscot in the 1940s, preventing the formation of frozen ice jams during the winter and providing an unobstructed path for ice-out in the spring. Long-term temperature records show a gradual warming since 1894, which may have reduced the ice jam flood potential at Bangor.

In the Groundhog Day gale of 1976, a storm surge went up the Penobscot, flooding Bangor for three hours. At 11:15 am, waters began rising on the river and within 15 minutes had risen a total of , flooding downtown. About 200 cars were submerged and office workers were stranded until waters receded. There were no reported deaths during this unusual flash flood.

===Climate===
Bangor has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), with cold, snowy winters, and warm summers, and is in USDA hardiness zone 5a. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July. On average, there are 20 nights annually that drop to or below, and 55 days where the temperature stays below freezing, including 49 days from December through February. There is an average of 6.1 days annually with highs at or above , with the last year to have not seen such temperatures being 2014. Extreme temperatures range from on February 10, 1948, up to on August 19, 1935.

The average first freeze of the season occurs on October 7, and the last May 7, resulting in a freeze-free season of 152 days; the corresponding dates for measurable snowfall, i.e. at least , are November 23 and April 4. The average annual snowfall for Bangor is approximately , while snowfall has ranged from in 1979–80 to in 1962−63; the record snowiest month was February 1969 with , while the most snow in one calendar day was on December 14, 1927. A snow depth of at least is on average seen 66 days per winter, including 54 days from January to March, when the snow pack is typically most reliable.

==Demographics==
As of 2008, Bangor is the third most populous city in Maine, as it has been for more than a century. As of 2012, the estimated population of the Bangor Metropolitan Area (which includes Penobscot County) is 153,746, indicating a slight growth rate since 2000, almost all of it accounted for by Bangor.

Historically Bangor received many immigrants as it industrialized. Irish-Catholic and later Jewish immigrants eventually became established members of the community, along with many migrants from Atlantic Canada. Of the 205 Black citizens who lived in Bangor in 1910, over a third were originally from Canada.

Bangor is the largest market town, distribution center, transportation hub, and media center in a five-county area whose population tops 330,000 and which includes Penobscot, Piscataquis, Hancock, Aroostook, and Washington counties.

Bangor&#x27;s city council has approved a resolution opposing the sale of sweat-shop-produced clothing in local stores.

===Tourism===

Outdoor activities in the Bangor City Forest and other nearby parks, forests, and waterways include hiking, sailing, canoeing, hunting, fishing, skiing, and snowmobiling.

Bangor Raceway at the Bass Park Civic Center and Auditorium offers live, pari-mutuel harness racing from May through July and then briefly in the fall. Hollywood Casino, operated by Penn National Gaming, originally opened as a slot machine only facility. In 2007, construction began on a $131-million casino complex in Bangor that houses, among other things, a gaming floor with about 1,000 slot machines, an off-track betting center, a seven-story hotel, and a four-level parking garage. In 2011, it was authorized to add table games.

===Military installations===
Bangor Air National Guard Base is a United States Air National Guard base. Created in 1927 as a commercial field, it was taken over by the U.S. Army just before World War II. In 1968, the base was sold to the city of Bangor, Maine, to become Bangor International Airport but has since continued to host the 101st Air Refueling Wing, Maine Air National Guard, part of the Northeast Tanker Task Force.

In 1990, the USAF East Coast Radar System (ECRS) Operation Center was activated in Bangor with over 400 personnel. The center controlled the over-the-horizon radar&#x27;s transmitter in Moscow, Maine, and receiver in Columbia Falls, Maine. With the end of the Cold War, the facility&#x27;s mission of guarding against a Soviet air attack became superfluous, and though it briefly turned its attention toward drug interdiction, the system was decommissioned in 1997 as the SSPARS system installation—the successor to the PAVE PAWS installation—in Massachusetts&#x27; Cape Cod Air Force Station reservation fully took over.

==Arts and culture==

* The Collins Center for the Arts

===Architecture===
Many buildings and monuments are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city has also had a municipal Historic Preservation Commission since the early 1980s. Bangor has many Greek Revival. Victorian, and Colonial Revival houses. Some notable architecture:
* The Thomas Hill Standpipe, a shingle style structure.
* The Hammond Street Congregation Church.
* The St. John&#x27;s Catholic Church.
* The Bangor House Hotel, now converted to apartments, is the only survivor among a series of &quot;Palace Hotels&quot; designed by Boston architect Isaiah Rogers, which were the first of their kind in the United States.
* The country&#x27;s second oldest garden cemetery is the Mount Hope Cemetery, designed by Charles G. Bryant.
* Richard Upjohn, British-born architect and early promoter of the Gothic Revival style, received some of his first commissions in Bangor, including the Isaac Farrar House (1833), Samuel Farrar House (1836), Thomas A. Hill House (presently owned by the Bangor Historical Society), and St. John&#x27;s Church (Episcopal, 1836–1839).
* Bangor Public Library by Peabody and Stearns.
* The Eastern Maine Insane Hospital, now Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center, by John Calvin Stevens.
* The William Arnold House of 1856, an Italianate style mansion and home to author Stephen King. Its wrought-iron fence with bat and spider web motif is King&#x27;s own addition.

===Public art and monuments===

The bow-plate of the battleship USS &quot;Maine&quot;, whose destruction in Havana, Cuba, presaged the start of the Spanish–American War, survives on a granite memorial by Charles Eugene Tefft in Davenport Park.

Bangor has a large fiberglass-over-metal statue of mythical lumberman Paul Bunyan by Normand Martin (1959).

There are three large bronze statues in downtown Bangor by sculptor Charles Eugene Tefft of Brewer, including the Luther H. Peirce Memorial, commemorating the Penobscot River Log-Drivers; a statue of Hannibal Hamlin at Kenduskeag Mall; and an image of &quot;Lady Victory&quot; at Norumbega Parkway.

The abstract aluminum sculpture &quot;Continuity of Community&quot; (1969) on the Bangor Waterfront, formerly in West Market Square, is by the Castine sculptor Clark Battle Fitz-Gerald.

The U.S. Post Office in Bangor contains Yvonne Jacquette&#x27;s 1980 three-part mural &quot;Autumn Expansion&quot;.

A 1962 bronze commemorating the 2nd Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment by Wisconsin sculptor Owen Vernon Shaffer stands at the entrance to Mount Hope Cemetery.

A memorial has been placed by Bangor City Council and members of the LGBT community along the Kenduskeag Stream honoring the memory of Charlie Howard as the victim of a hate crime. In 1984 he was beaten and thrown off Bangor&#x27;s State Street Bridge by three young men in a what would become a high-profile example of violence against LGBT people. The murder of Charlie Howard inspired the formation of The Maine Lesbian/Gay Political Alliance, which later became EqualityMaine. In May 2011, vandals spray-painted graffiti and an anti-gay slur on the memorial. Family and friends cleaned it up and rededicated it.

==Sports==

From 2002 to 2017, Bangor had been home to Little League International&#x27;s Senior League World Series.

Bangor was home to two minor league baseball teams affiliated with the 1995–1998 Northeast League: the Bangor Blue Ox (1996–1997) and the Bangor Lumberjacks (2003–2004). Even earlier the Bangor Millionaires (1894–1896) played in the New England League.

Vince McMahon promoted his first professional wrestling event in Bangor in 1979. In 1985, the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship changed hands for the first time outside of Puerto Rico at an IWCCW show in Bangor.

The Penobscot is a salmon-fishing river; the Penobscot Salmon Club traditionally sent the first fish caught to the President of the United States. From 1999 to 2006, low fish stocks resulted in a ban on salmon fishing. Today, the wild salmon population (and the sport) is slowly recovering. The Penobscot River Restoration Project is working to help the fish population by removing some dams north of Bangor.

The Kenduskeag Stream Canoe Race, a white-water event which begins just north of Bangor in Kenduskeag, has been held since 1965.

==Government==
Bangor is the county seat of Penobscot County.

Since 1931, Bangor has had a council–manager form of government. The nine-member city council is a nonpartisan body, with three city councilors elected to three-year terms each year. The nine council members elect the chair of the city council, who is referred to informally as the mayor, and plays the role when there is a ceremonial need. As of 2023-2024, the council members are Susan Deane, Carolyn Fish, Rick Fournier, Susan Hawes, Joseph Leonard, Cara Pelletier (Chair), Gretchen Schaefer, Dan Tremble and Dina Yacoubagha.

In 2007, Bangor was the first city in the U.S. to ban smoking in vehicles carrying passengers under the age of 18.

In 2012, Bangor&#x27;s city council passed an order in support of same-sex marriage in Maine. In 2013, the City of Bangor also signed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court calling for the federal Defense of Marriage Act to be struck down.

In the United States House of Representatives, Bangor is included in Maine&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and is currently represented by Democrat Jared F. Golden.

===Law and order===
In 2008 Bangor&#x27;s crime rate was the second-lowest among American metropolitan areas of comparable size. As of 2014 Bangor had the third highest rate of property crime in Maine.

The arrival of Irish immigrants from nearby Canada beginning in the 1830s, and their competition with locals for jobs, sparked a deadly sectarian riot in 1833 that lasted for days and had to be put down by militia. Realizing the need for a police force, the town incorporated as The City of Bangor in 1834. In the 1800s, sailors and loggers gave the city a reputation for roughness; their stomping grounds were known as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Half Acre&quot;. The same name was also applied, at roughly the same time, to The Devil&#x27;s Half-Acre, Pennsylvania.

Although Maine was the first &quot;dry&quot; state (i.e. the first to prohibit the sale of alcohol, with the passage of the &quot;Maine law&quot; in 1851), Bangor managed to remain &quot;wet&quot;. The city had 142 saloons in 1890. A look-the-other-way attitude by local police and politicians (sustained by a system of bribery in the form of ritualized fine-payments known as &quot;The Bangor Plan&quot;) allowed Bangor to flout the nation&#x27;s most long-standing state prohibition law. In 1913, the war of the &quot;drys&quot; (prohibitionists) on &quot;wet&quot; Bangor escalated when the Penobscot County Sheriff was impeached and removed by the Maine Legislature for not enforcing anti-liquor laws. His successor was asked to resign by the governor the following year for the same reason, but refused. A third sheriff was removed by the governor in 1918, but promptly re-nominated by the Democratic Party. Prohibitionist Carrie Nation had been forcibly expelled from the Bangor House hotel in 1902 after causing a disturbance.

In October 1937, &quot;public enemy&quot; Al Brady and another member of his &quot;Brady Gang&quot; (Clarence Shaffer) were killed in the bloodiest shootout in Maine&#x27;s history. FBI agents ambushed Brady, Shaffer, and James Dalhover on Bangor&#x27;s Central Street after they had attempted to purchase a Thompson submachine gun from Dakin&#x27;s Sporting Goods downtown. Brady is buried in the public section of Mount Hope Cemetery, on the north side of Mount Hope Avenue. Until recently, Brady&#x27;s grave was unmarked. A group of schoolchildren erected a wooden marker over his grave in the 1990s, which was replaced by a more permanent stone in 2007.

Radio stations in the city include WKIT and WZON, owned by Zone Radio Corporation, a company owned by Bangor resident novelist Stephen King. WHSN is a non-commercial alternative rock station licensed to Bangor and run and operated by staff and students at the New England School of Communications on the campus of Husson University. Several other stations in the market are owned by Blueberry Broadcasting and Townsquare Media.

====Pandemics====
In 1832, a cholera epidemic in Saint John, New Brunswick, (part of the Second cholera pandemic) sent as many as eight hundred poor Irish immigrants walking to Bangor. This was the beginning of Maine&#x27;s first substantial Irish-Catholic community. Competition with Americans for jobs caused a riot and resulting fire in 1833. In 1849–50, the Second cholera pandemic reached Bangor itself, killing 20–30 within the first week, 112 had died by October 1849. The final death toll was 161. A late outbreak of the disease in 1854 killed seventeen others. The victims in most cases were poor Irish immigrants. In 1872, a smallpox epidemic closed local schools. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, which was global in scope, struck over a thousand Bangoreans and killed more than a hundred. This was the worst &#x27;natural disaster&#x27; in the city&#x27;s history since the cholera epidemic of 1849.

<text>Brewer is a city in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. It is part of the Bangor metropolitan area. The city is named after its first settler, Colonel John Brewer. The population was 9,672 at the 2020 census.

Brewer is the sister city of Bangor. The two are at the head of navigation on opposite sides of the Penobscot River estuary and are connected by three bridges. Brewer and Bangor were originally both part of Condeskeag Plantation, though the Brewer part was also called &quot;New Worcester&quot; after John Brewer&#x27;s birthplace. In 1788, Orrington, Maine was incorporated with Brewer/New Worcester as its major village. The other half of Kenduskeag incorporated in 1791 as Bangor. Finally, in 1812, Brewer broke away from Orrington and incorporated as a separate town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The villages of South Brewer and North Brewer are both within city limits. South Brewer was formerly the city&#x27;s major industrial area.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Brewer has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==Historic buildings==

The Victorian-style Daniel Sargent House (1847 and later) in South Brewer is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Sargent was the owner of a large South Brewer sawmill. During the Civil War, he commanded the company of &quot;Tigers&quot; (Penobscot River Drivers) in the 2nd Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, also called &quot;The Bangor Regiment&quot;. This was the first unit to march out of the state in 1861, and participated in 11 battles over two years. Sargent was eventually promoted to Lt. Col., or second in-command of the regiment.
The city&#x27;s most imposing architectural landmark is the shingle style First Congregational Church, which stands on a bluff above the river overlooking Bangor.

==Historic industries==

Brewer was as famous for brick-making in the 19th century as Bangor was for lumber. By the 1850s, there were 12–15 brickyards in Brewer making 12 million bricks annually. Most of these were shipped to Boston and vicinity. It is said that most of the Back Bay and South End neighborhoods of Boston are built of Brewer brick. Frank O. Farrington of Brewer patented a machine for edging and turning bricks in 1859.

Ship-building was also a major Brewer industry, as was saw-milling. Brewer&#x27;s sawmills tended to be steam-powered, unlike those farther up the Penobscot River, which were powered by waterfalls. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city also had a significant ice industry, which survives today in the form of the Getchell Brothers company.
The Eastern Manufacturing Company opened a pulp and paper mill in South Brewer in 1889 that became the city&#x27;s largest employer. The mill closed in 2004, and the site has now been re-developed by the Cianbro Corporation. The Eastern began as a sawmill owned by Fred W. Ayer, who in the late 1880s began experimenting with paper-making (using the newly developed sulfite process) in order to utilize his left-over slab lumber. In 1899, Ayer patented a new method of sulfite digestion which subsequently became the basis for operations at the Eastern, as well as the Great Northern mill in Millinocket, Maine, thus circumventing an important patent owned by the competing International Paper Corporation. &quot;The Eastern&quot;, as the mill was known locally, began specializing in fine grades of paper around 1905 (such as their trademark &quot;Atlantic Bond&quot;), and the company was eventually renamed Eastern Fine Paper, Inc..

==Notable events==

In 1900, Dione Polliot, a 17-year-old French-Canadian girl, won $10 (over $200 today) for being the first person to climb to the top of the 173-foot chimney of the Eastern Manufacturing Company. The company had a standing offer of $5 to the first boy who made it to the top, but all had turned back half-way. The bet was spontaneously doubled when Polliot took the dare. The feat was reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which called Polliot &quot;not only the prettiest girl in South Brewer, but the pluckiest&quot;.

In the early hours of August 29, 1903, bank robbers broke into the Brewer Savings Bank using dynamite. They took $300 from the vault (most of the money having been removed beforehand) and retreated across the bridge to Bangor firing their guns at people in Brewer and police on the Bangor side. Despite mobilizing the entire Bangor police force in pursuit, they escaped capture.

On June 12, 1906, four Brewer High School students drowned while sailing at Brewer Lake. On hearing the news, a woman in nearby Old Town went into a trance and reportedly identified the location of the bodies with some accuracy, though they were recovered before her information arrived at the lake. The incident was later reported in the &quot;Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research&quot;. Graduation ceremonies were canceled and 1,000 people attended the funeral.

In January 2019, a photographer conducting a First Amendment Audit was criminally trespassed from City Hall after video recording the public lobby. This prompted calls from across the country to various city offices inquiring into the event.

<text>Charleston is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. It is part of the Bangor Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,558 at the 2020 census. Charleston includes the village of West Charleston and is home to the Higgins Classical Institute, a Christian school.

==History==

Charleston was first settled as early as 1795 by Charles Vaughan. The land was granted on July 14, 1802, by the Massachusetts General Court to John Lowell. Known as T2 R5 NWP, or Township 2, Range 4, North of the Waldo Patent, it was incorporated on February 16, 1811, as New Charlestown, to distinguish it from Charlestown, Massachusetts, when that state included the province of Maine. But in 1820, Maine achieved statehood, so any confusion between the two ceased. Consequently, in 1827 the name was shortened to Charleston.

Sawmills were established to operate by water power at the streams. But Charleston was primarily an agricultural town. Its large farms were noted for raising horses and cattle. In 1837, the Higgins Classical Institute was founded. By 1870, the community had a population of 1,191. Between 1901 and 1930, the Bangor Railway &amp; Electric Company operated trolleys on an electric railway between Bangor and Charleston.

In late 1950, construction began on the Charleston Air Force Station, part of the Aerospace Defense Command. Known as Bull Hill for its location in the town, the station was completed in early 1951, and fully staffed and operational in 1952. After the base closed, it was transformed into the Charleston Correctional Facility, which opened in 1980.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is the Weymouths land. Charleston is drained by Rollins Brook and South Gate Brook.

The town is located near the intersection of Charleston Road and South Stagecoach Road-Atkinson Road, between Route 15 (Bangor Road) and Route 221, and halfway between Schoodic Lake and Sebasticook Lake.

<text>Corinna is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,221 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bangor metropolitan statistical area. The village of Corinna is in the southern part of the town.

==History==

It was first called T4 R4 NWP (or Township 4, Range 4, North of the Waldo Patent). On June 30, 1804, Dr. John Warren of Boston bought on speculation from Massachusetts for two cents an acre, or $460.80. To encourage settlement, he gave away some land and built a combination gristmill and sawmill. The town would be incorporated on December 11, 1816, as Corinna, named after Dr. Warren&#x27;s daughter.

The first homes were built of hewn logs. Corinna developed into a farming community, with water powered mills at the outlet of Corundel Lake. After the arrival of the Dexter and Newport Railroad in 1865–1866, the village developed into a small mill town. Industries would include sawmills, planing mills, woolen textile mills, and a door, sash and blind factory. There were also boot and shoemaking shops and an iron foundry. The Eastland Woolen Mill manufactured woolen materials from the 1930s until it closed in 1997, after which it was demolished. The town is now largely a bedroom community of Bangor.

===Historic building===
The Stewart Free Library (1898), a gift to the town by Corinna-born Minneapolis millionaire Levi M. Stewart, was designed by Minneapolis architect William Harrison Grimshaw. The library is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and contains well-preserved historic interiors as well as a majestic facade with a clocktower. It resembles a mid-western county courthouse more than a typical small-town Maine library. The Corinna Union Academy educated students in the town from 1851 to 1968.

A memorial dedicated to the soldiers who have died in the War on Terror is located near the river. It is made of marble and inscribed with the names of fallen soldiers.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Situated beside Corundel Lake, Corinna is drained by the East Branch Sebasticook River and Alder Stream, both part of the Kennebec River watershed.

The town is located at the intersection of Route 7 (Dexter Road), Route 11 (Exeter Road) and Route 43 (St. Albans Road), and is centered between the towns of Exeter, St. Albans, Dexter and Newport, about north of Interstate 95. Corinna is also located on the Newport/Dover-Foxcroft Rail Trail, which was developed along a former Maine Central Railroad line after tracks and ties were removed in 1993.

===Climate===

This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Corinna has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Corinth is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,900 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Colin Palmer was the founder of Corinth. In 1792, he built his home on Lot 10 First Range. Tibbetts enlisted as a private in Captain Reuben Dyers&#x27; company at the age of 17 on May 26, 1777, from Gouldsboro, Maine. Tibbetts&#x27; grave, with an official grave marker of a Revolutionary War soldier, is found in the East Exeter cemetery.

The town was settled in the late 1790s by the extended Daniel Skinner family and originally called &quot;Ohio&quot;. There is still an &quot;Ohio Street&quot; in nearby Bangor, being a portion of the original road or trail connecting that town with what is now Corinth. When the town was incorporated in 1811, it changed its name to Corinth, a reference to the classical Greek city. A number of Penobscot County towns incorporated in the same period such as Milo, Etna, Carmel, and Levant (and Troy, in neighboring Waldo County) were given similarly exotic names, referencing the ancient Mediterranean world, probably in order to help attract settlers. Some of these names also have Biblical references.

By the mid-19th century, the town had three villages: East Corinth, West Corinth, and South Corinth. East Corinth emerged as the largest, and had five shops making carriages and sleighs (a local specialty) by the 1850s.

The Skinner Settlement in West Corinth is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This early 19th century village-scape includes a general store, schoolhouse, and Methodist church. The Robeyville Covered Bridge near East Corinth is also listed on the National Register, and is one of very few such bridges to survive in Maine.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land, of which 38% is covered in forest.

<text>Dixmont is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,211 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Bangor Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Dixmont was originally granted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (of which Maine was then a part) to Bowdoin College, which sold the first settlers their land. For that reason it was initially called &quot;Collegetown&quot;. The first settlement was made in 1799.

One of the largest purchasers of land in Collegetown was Dr. Elijah Dix of Boston, who never lived there but took an interest in its settlement. When the town was incorporated in 1807, it named itself after Dix. A &quot;malignant fever&quot; broke out among the settlers that same year, killing many of them. Still, the population grew in the decade 1800–1810 from 59 to 337, a rate of increase never repeated. Dr. Dix also died in Dixmont on a trip there in 1809, and was buried in the Dixmont Corner Cemetery.

Dix was the grandfather of reformer Dorothea Dix, who was born in nearby Hampden. Her father was probably the family&#x27;s land agent, overseeing settlement in Dixmont. Dixfield, Maine, in Oxford County, is also named after Dr. Dix.

Dixmont was on the main stage-coach route between Bangor and Augusta, and given that it had the highest elevation along that road, it became a natural rest-stop for tired horses. Wrote William Lloyd Garrison in 1832: &quot;The Dixmont Hills are famous and formidable along this route . . . they are piled upon my memory in all their massive mobility.&quot;

By the 1850s the population of the town had peaked at over 1,600, which is over 400 more than it has today. It had three sawmills, a shingle mill, two flour and grist mills, and many productive farms.

In the 1870s there were two small corporations in Dixmont making cheese, one owned by L.P. Toothacker, and the other by Benjamin Bussey. In 1880 Dixmont had two hotels and one physician. Sheep farming was popular, probably because of the hilly landscape. In 1880, Dixmont had more sheep than any town in Penobscot County.

A rare earthquake shook North Dixmont (and Unity, Albion, Plymouth, and Weeks Mills) in 1895 but no damage was reported.

By 1900, the population of Dixmont was down to 843.

==Geography==

Dixmont&#x27;s highest hills are Peaked Mountain and Mount Harris, the latter above sea level. In 1854 the United States Coast Survey erected an observatory on top of Mount Harris.

Like many Maine towns, Dixmont has multiple villages. The four main ones are Dixmont Corner, North Dixmont, East Dixmont, and Dixmont Center.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The town was founded by and named after Jonathan Eddy, a militia captain in the French and Indian War, a colonel in the American Revolutionary War, and the first magistrate in the area.

Eddy tried to make Nova Scotia—the 14th American colony—join the revolution by leading the Siege of Fort Cumberland. After the siege failed, Eddy and others emigrated to the District of Maine and were given land grants in present-day Eddington. Later in the war, Eddy successfully defended Maine from a British attack in the Battle of Machias (1777).

<text>Enfield is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,435 at the 2020 census. There is also a large seasonal population with many cottages located on Cold Stream Pond, a lake within the town.

==History==
Enfield was first settled on the east bank of the Penobscot River about 1820, and was originally called Cold Stream. It was incorporated on January 31, 1835.

In 1891, four armed men boarded and attempted to rob a train as it passed through Enfield, shooting at the engineer, fireman, and conductors. They also shot up the train station. They failed in their attempt to break into the mail-car, but it was a dark night and they escaped capture.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Cold Stream Pond===

Cold Stream Pond covers the eastern side of the town of Enfield. There is a public boat launching facility on Old Hatchery Road off Maine State Route 188. A ridge creates a narrow portion of the pond separating a smaller northern basin from the larger southern basin. Summer oxygen concentrations often become unfavorably low in the northern basin. The most significant tributary is Smelt Brook draining Upper Cold Stream Pond and Little Round Pond into the northern basin from Lincoln. The southwestern corner of the pond overflows through Cold Stream, south to reach the Passadumkeag River upstream of the Penobscot River. Cobb State Fish Hatchery is located beside the outlet, using water from the pond to raise fish for stocking elsewhere. A self-sustaining native population of lake trout spawn in Webb Cove in the southeastern corner of the pond. The lake trout forage on a population of rainbow smelt spawning in Smelt Brook. Atlantic salmon were introduced to the pond in 1876.

<text>Levant is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,970 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Originally called Kenduskeag Plantation, the town was founded in 1802 by Major Moses Hodsden who built three houses, a sawmill, a grist-mill, a store, and a blacksmith shop in what is now the village of Kenduskeag. At the time, these were likely the only framed buildings between Bangor and the Kennebec River. In 1813 the plantation became a town, and was given the name Levant, which is that part of the Middle East which borders the Mediterranean.

In 1852, the village of Kenduskeag broke away from the rest of Levant and took part of the neighboring town of Glenburn to form the present town of Kenduskeag. Prior to the break the town had 1,841 inhabitants.

In early 1824, Levant Congregational minister John Bovee Dods claimed that he was visited by a spirit, and his house subsequently became the site of poltergeist activity. Perhaps a hundred curious people were said to have visited and witnessed these events. Dods became a Universalist in 1826, and moved to nearby Union, though he continued to preach in Levant. He later moved to Massachusetts and became an early psychologist, publishing &quot;The Philosophy of Electrical Psychology&quot; in 1850, and lecturing widely. In 1856 he converted to spiritualism, and became a leading figure in that religion in New York City.

One of the last tarring and feathering episodes in Maine took place in Levant in 1899, the victim being an evangelical minister named George W. Higgins of the Disciples of the Holy Ghost, whose headquarters was the Shiloh Temple in Durham, Maine, and whose spiritual leader was Frank Sandford. Higgins had made about 15 converts in Levant, and encouraged them to turn over all their property to Sandford and go to live in the Durham temple. After one member had committed suicide and Higgins had told another to whip a small child because he was possessed by a demon, two selectmen ordered him to leave town. When he refused, a mob seized him, covered him with hot tar and feathers, and rode him on a rail a number of miles to the town line, some following behind in carriages. An area in town where many &quot;Higginsites&quot; lived was known as &quot;Higginsville&quot; as late as the 1930s.

<text>Mattawamkeag is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States, located where the Mattawamkeag River joins the Penobscot River. The population was 596 at the 2020 census. The village of Mattawamkeag is in the southwestern part of the town.

==Railroad history==
Mattawamkeag&#x27;s history is inextricably linked to the railroad.

The European &amp; North American Railway built a track up the Penobscot River valley from Bangor and reached Mattawamkeag in 1869. By October 1871, the line was completed from Mattawamkeag to Vanceboro, where it connected through to Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. The Maine Central Railroad leased the Bangor-Vanceboro E&amp;NA in 1882 and purchased it in 1955.

In 1889, the International Railway of Maine was completed between Megantic, Quebec, and Mattawamkeag, where it interchanged with the Maine Central. The parent company of the International Railway, Canadian Pacific, obtained running rights from Maine Central for Mattawamkeag to Vanceboro, where it regained CPR trackage in New Brunswick. This placed Mattawamkeag on the transcontinental mainline of the Canadian Pacific, running from Saint John to Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1974, CPR purchased the Mattawamkeag-Vanceboro railway tracks from Maine Central. In 1988, CPR transferred trackage east of Megantic to its subsidiary Canadian Atlantic Railway. In 1994, Canadian Atlantic was sold, with the line running through Mattawamkeag being purchased by J. D. Irving, and is now operated as the Eastern Maine Railway.

Maine Central was purchased by Guilford Transportation Industries in 1981 and became part of Guilford Rail System, since renamed Pan Am Railways. Pan Am now operates as a subsidiary of the larger CSX Transportation network, and is both the northernmost and easternmost point on the CSX Transportation network.

==Historic building==

The George W. Smith Homestead (1874) in Mattawamkeag is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Mount Chase is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 187 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. It is heavily forested and includes scenic lakes. It is situated 10 miles from Patten and 15 miles from the north entrance to Baxter State Park. Katahdin is visible from many locations.

=== Mt. Chase ===
Mt. Chase is a peak of volcanic origin with a height of 2440 feet.

=== Upper Shin Pond ===
Upper Shin Pond is a large lake of 544 acres with a maximum depth of 64 feet.

=== Lower Shin Pond ===
Lower Shin Pond is a large lake measuring 560 acres with a maximum depth of 25 feet.

== History ==
The land surrounding Mt. Katahdin is believed to have been utilized by Penobscot and Maliseet peoples for thousands of years. Local names for peaks, waterways, and other landmarks reflect this heritage.

The town of Mount Chase acquired its name from its prominent mountain peak, described above. Its first permanent residents are dated to 1838, although two families are included in the 1837 Maine Census. In 1860 the population was 250, and in 1862 it was organized and renamed the Mount Chase Plantation. On March 2, 1864, it became the town of Mount Chase. In 1880 it had 310 residents; in 1900 there were 299.

In the aftermath of the American Civil War, the railroad extended its lines along the Penobscot River from Bangor to Mattawamkeag. An 1882 history described Mount Chase as located &quot;on the stage line from the European &amp; North American Railroad at Mattawamkeag to Fort Kent in the extreme north of the State, on the St John.&quot; Residents and tourists could now take advantage of the 50-mile stage route from Mattawamkeag to Mount Chase, and supplies could be shipped in and goods or wild game out more readily.

== Hotels and sporting camps ==

=== Shin Pond House/Shin Pond Village ===
The Shin Pond House was established in the 1870s by Charles H. Sibley and was initially Mount Chase&#x27;s only hotel. The next hotel keeper was Ted Crommett. The original Shin Pond House burned and was rebuilt in 1912 by Zenas L. Harvey, who added cabins to the lodging options. After a fire in 1949, Arthur and Edna Augustine purchased the property and built a new Shin Pond House. After their tenure, the building was destroyed by another fire in 1979. In the early 1980s Craig and Terry Hill envisioned a recreational resort on the former Shin Pond House site, called the Shin Pond Village. They built a general store, public laundry and public showers. Campsites and guest suites were added, along with new cabins.

=== Point-of-Pines Camps ===
Point-of-Pines Camps was created on Upper Shin Pond and operated by G. F. Root. In 1952 it was included in a survey of Maine wilderness sporting camps, though described as &quot;less wilderness in concept and category.&quot;

=== Mt. Chase Lodge ===
Mt. Chase Lodge was established in 1960 on Upper Shin Pond as a recreational sporting lodge. Since 1976 Rick and Sara Hill have operated the lodge.

=== Driftwood Lodge and Camps ===
The Driftwood Lodge and camps is located on the east side of Upper Shin Pond. It is managed by Paul and Tracy Reed and features a guide service for bear hunters.

== Economy and industries==
Early workers were attracted to the Mount Chase area for opportunities working for lumber companies. In 1881, &quot;A Gazetteer of the State of Maine,&quot; emphasized that the area was &quot;well wooded&quot; and offered a saw mill on Crystal Brook at the eastern side of town. However, another contemporary work pointing out that farming was by then the major occupation of Mount Chase&#x27;s inhabitants. Maintaining sporting camps and offering wilderness guide services have continued as means of support to the present time. Recent decades have seen the rise of snowmobiling as a major winter sport.

According to American Community Survey estimates, the most common industry category for Mount Chase is &quot;agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining,&quot; followed by &quot;retail trade.&quot;

<doc id="116136" wikidata="Q1642029" url="?curid=116136" title="Old Town, Maine">
<text>Old Town is a city in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 7,431 at the 2020 census. The city&#x27;s developed area is chiefly located on the relatively large Marsh Island, but its boundaries extend beyond it. The island is surrounded and defined by the Penobscot River to the east and the Stillwater River to the west.

==History==
The Abenaki people called it &quot;Pannawambskek,&quot; meaning &quot;where the ledges spread out,&quot; referring to rapids and drops in the river bed. The French established a Jesuit Catholic mission here in the 1680s. Nearly a century later after Great Britain took over French territory following its victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the area was settled by English pioneers in 1774. The name Old Town derives from &quot;Indian Old Town&quot;, which was the English name for the largest Penobscot Indian village, now known as Indian Island.

Located within the city limits but on its own island in the Penobscot River, the reservation is the current and historical home of the Penobscot Nation.

In 1820, when the present city was set off from neighboring Orono (named for a Penobscot sachem), it was given the name Old Town because it contained the Penobscot village. Over time, the Penobscot village ceased to be called Old Town, and the name migrated to the much newer American settlement across the river.

Old Town may be best known for Old Town Canoe Co., a major manufacturer of canoes and kayaks, which has been based in the city for more than 100 years. The city&#x27;s location along a series of rapids in the Penobscot River, near the head of tide just downstream in Bangor, made it an ideal location in the 1800s to marshal the water power for mills to process lumber from the millions of board feet of spruce and pine logs floated annually down the Penobscot.

Today many residents work for the University of Maine in Orono and the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, the two largest employers in the area. Old Town is home to the Nine Dragons Paper Holdings Limited-owned Old Town paper mill.

The city of Old Town includes Treat-Webster Island (a.k.a. &quot;French Island&quot;), a predominantly residential neighborhood located on a small island in the middle of the Penobscot River. French Island is the intermediate land mass between Milford and Old Town; it is connected on either side by a bridge.

==Geography==

Old Town is located at (44.943047, −68.676461).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. With its business district located on an island, Old Town is drained by the Stillwater River and Penobscot River.

A small neighborhood north of Stillwater Avenue on the mainland side of the Stillwater River is recognized by the United States Postal Service as &quot;Stillwater,&quot; and has its own post office and ZIP code. The Census Bureau does not recognize Stillwater and counts that area as part of Old Town.

The city is crossed by Interstate 95, U. S. Route 2 and 2A, and state routes 16, 43 and 116. It borders the towns of Orono to the south, Glenburn to the west, Hudson to the northwest, Alton and Argyle Township to the north, and (separated by water) is near Milford east, and Bradley to the southeast.

<text>Orrington is a town on the Penobscot River estuary in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. The population was 3,812 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Orrington was originally part of Condustiegg or Kenduskeag Plantation, which also included the present-day cities of Bangor and Brewer. Orrington was incorporated as a town in 1788 with its major village at Brewer, then called &quot;New Worcester&quot;. Bangor incorporated three years later in 1791. Brewer broke away from Orrington in 1812 to form a separate town.

The name &quot;Orrington&quot; reportedly resulted from a spelling mistake. The settlers intended to name it &quot;Orangetown&quot; after Orangetown, Maryland, but it was written on the record-books in distant Massachusetts, of which Maine was then a territory, as &quot;Orrington&quot;. &quot;Orring&quot; was a reasonable phonetic rendering of &quot;orange&quot; before the standardization of English spelling.

For much of its town history Orrington was a shipping and ship building community. The Boston &amp; Penobscot Shipbuilding Company yard was on Mill Creek, South Orrington. ice cut from the Penobscot River was shipped as far away as the British West Indies.

==Geography==
Orrington lies on the estuary of the Penobscot River. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Transport==
While the Bangor area is served by two commercial bus carriers, it does not include service to Orrington.
Freight rail service is provided by the Bangor &amp; Aroostook Railroad Company and by the Maine Central Railroad Company (operated by the Springfield Terminal Railway (Vermont)). Rail connecting Bucksport to Brewer runs through Orrington along the shore of the Penobscot River with a spur line to the former HoltraChem site. There are intermodal rail facilities in Bangor and in Hermon, Maine both with ready access to Interstate 95 and to Bangor International Airport.

== Economy ==
Orrington was home to the HoltraChem plant, which occupied 235 acres alongside the Penobscot River. It produced chlorine and other chemicals for the Maine´s paper and pulp industry. In September 2000, HoltraChem closed its plant in Orrington, terminating 72 employees, at the time the town’s second largest employer, and the town’s largest taxable property.
As of 2002, the Penobscot Energy Recovery Corporation (PERC) waste-to-energy incinerator remained the only industrial employer (82 people).

==Environmental contamination==
The HoltraChem site itself was heavily contaminated, and cleanup was ordered by and as of 2022 is overseen by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.
Starting in 1967, HoltraChem had disposed of up to 13 tons of mercury into the river and mercury concentrations in lobsters and crabs have been so high that the Department of Marine Resources ordered a fishery closure.

In 2000, the Maine People’s Alliance and NRDC filed a lawsuit against Mallinckrodt US LLC, the successor to the plant’s first corporate owner. In March 2021, a settlement submitted to a federal district court started the process of a river cleanup plan, long-term monitoring, and funding for projects to benefit communities affected by the pollution.

<text>Patten is a small town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 881. The village of Patten is in the northeastern part of the town.

==History==

The town was named for Amos Patten, a resident of Bangor, Maine, who about 1828 purchased Township No. 4, Range 6, as it was then designated, for its vast timber supply. In 1829 Amos Patten hired Ira Fish and Eli Kellogg to survey the land. The surveyors soon asked permission to establish their homes in Patten. The town was incorporated on April 16, 1841, and given its present name at that time. By 1850 the population numbered 470, reaching 704 in 1870, and 716 residents in 1880. The town&#x27;s infrastructure gradually appeared. In March 1841 the Congregational Church was organized. Within a few years, citizens began agitating for local education. A bill to appoint Trustees of the Patten Academy passed the Maine legislature and was signed by the governor in 1847. The Patten Academy opened its doors with 61 students in September 1848, and educated its residents for more than a century.

Two factors explain Patten&#x27;s comparatively early development, and its position as the major town of the Penobscot panhandle and southwestern Aroostook in the nineteenth century. First, it is the first town beyond the Mount Katahdin range, giving it access to the upper East Branch and lower Allagash River basins, which were leading lumbering areas. Its close proximity to several major rivers and streams allowed abundant water power but did not favor the development of large-scale industry, Small mills and workshops utilized its power during most of the town&#x27;s history.

Second, it has the best agricultural land in the proximity of those basins. As a result, lumbering stimulated very early development of commerce and farming; and the town early gained the status as the distribution center and cultural nexus of all the towns west of Houlton and north of Lincoln. It is situated at the intersection of Maine Rte. 11 and Maine State Route 159.

The six buildings of the Bradford Farm (1840) in Patten are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and are now occupied by the Bradford House Bed &amp; Breakfast Inn.

==Geography==

Patten lies on the western edge of the Mattawamkeag River system basin, almost at the edge of the East Branch of the Penobscot River&#x27;s basin. Two major Mattawamkeag tributaries occupy its area: in the north, Fish Stream (formerly known as the &quot;Mattawamkeag West Branch&quot;), and in the south, small feeders of Molunkus Stream. Fish Stream is navigable by very small craft as far as Island Falls, approximately distance, for about six months of the year. In the early days of lumbering, it was used to drive local cutting downstream, eventually to the mills at Old Town and Bangor.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===

This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Patten has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Brownville is a town in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,139 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Brownville, Knight&#x27;s Landing and Brownville Junction, near which passes the 100-Mile Wilderness of the Appalachian Trail.

==History==

The area was a part of the Waldo Patent purchased by Moses Brown and Major Josiah Hill of Newburyport, Massachusetts, who initiated its settlement. In 1806, they built a dam and watermills on the Pleasant River. First known as township T5 R8 NWP, the community was organized in 1819 as Brownville Plantation. It was named for Francis Brown (nephew of Moses Brown), who was a mill owner and trader from Newbury, Massachusetts. In 1824, the town was incorporated as Brownville.

Early settlers were given to clear and cultivate. Farms produced hay, oats, potatoes, wheat and garden vegetables. Water power from the Pleasant River attracted industry, including sawmills, clapboard mills, gristmills, a shovel handle factory and a carriage factory. Quarries were established to extract the region&#x27;s abundant slate, the quality of which won first prize at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. In 1843, the Bangor &amp; Piscataquis Slate Company opened with 60 employees. It sent out 8,000-12,000 squares of roofing slate annually. The Merrill Quarry opened in 1846 with approximately 80 employees, producing 30,000 squares of roofing slate annually. The Highland Quarry opened with Welsh employees, recruited because they were accustomed to working in slate. The last quarry closed in 1917.

Iron ore was discovered at the foot of Ore Mountain. The Katahdin Iron Works was established in 1843, when roads were cut out and a blast furnace erected. A hotel and several houses were built for workers. Charcoal was made in 14 kilns, consuming 10,000 cords of wood per year. The company and land were sold in 1845, and the new owners operated it until 1856, the year it produced 2350 tons of iron. However, shipping it to Bangor was expensive. The Bangor and Katahdin Iron Works Railway (B&amp;KIW) was constructed to Brownville in 1881, then connected north to the Katahdin Iron Works in 1883.

In 1889 the International Railway of Maine was constructed by its owner Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), extending the CPR&#x27;s transcontinental mainline east from Montreal, Quebec to Saint John, New Brunswick. The CPR line passed three miles north of Brownville, where it crossed the B&amp;KIW at a location that was named Brownville Junction. In 1891, the B&amp;KIW merged into the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad (BAR) after the Katahdin Iron Works closed the previous year. The BAR line as well as the CPR line west of Brownville became part of the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway and are now part of the Central Maine and Québec Railway. In 2019, the Canadian Pacific Railway purchased the Central Maine and Québec Railway, once again, giving the railway access to the Port of Saint John running trains from Brownville Junction to New Brunswick via New Brunswick Southern Railway.

Local historian Bill Sawtell has documented many facets of the history of Brownville as well as the surrounding area. He has published numerous books with subjects such as Katahdin Iron Works, the Highland Quarry, the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad, and Penquis Valley High School basketball.

<text>Medford is a town in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. The population was 230 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1808 James Grover was the first white settler in what is now Medford. In 1820, the state opened a road from the Piscataquis River, which helped increase settlement.

In 1820, John Parker Boyd, owner of the eastern half of the town, erected a combination sawmill and shingle mill on the Piscataquis River. In 1824, the town incorporated as Kilmarnock, the name chosen by Boyd.

An 1825 fire destroyed over three-quarters of the buildings in town, as well as the large stand of pine trees used to supply the sawmill and shingle mill. The mill was saved, but later closed because the burning of the nearby trees had deprived the business of a steady supply of wood.

The inhabitants of Kilmarnock petitioned to change the town&#x27;s name to Medford in 1856. The town surrendered its charter in 1940, and was organized as a plantation in 1942. In 1967, Medford was again organized as a town.

<text>Monson is a town in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. The population was 609 at the 2020 census. The town is located on Route 15 which is a significant route north into the well known Moosehead Lake Region, to which Monson can be considered a gateway. This route eventually leads to the Canadian Province of Quebec.

The town is well known in local and state history, and contributions by the town and its location are notable. It is the last town located on the Appalachian Trail at the beginning (or end) of the Hundred-Mile Wilderness. It is not uncommon to see many hikers in town resting before (or after) their trip into the Wilderness, and several lodging places in town cater directly to these hikers.

==History==

Monson was founded on February 8, 1822, by an act of the state legislature. It was named after Monson, Massachusetts. Previously the town was part of a piece of land granted to both Hebron Academy and Monson Academy by the state of Massachusetts in 1811. On April 22, 1822, the town had its first town meeting to form a government. However, the first settler came here in 1816 after being here the previous fall to clear trees out for a settlement. Monson is also referenced in the book &quot;The Maine Woods&quot; by Henry David Thoreau, wherein a drawing of moose antlers depicting the direction and names of both Blanchard and Monson, and the town is mentioned in other sections of the book. The antlers have been stolen and replaced several times, but currently they exist in the approximate location on a pole after leaving the town of Abbot.

In 1870, slate was discovered by a resident who had immigrated from Wales, while driving his horse in the countryside of the town. Over the next few decades, many slate quarries were created, increasing the population of the town, as well as generating a source of income for residents. Large-scale slate operations required construction of the Monson Railroad in 1883; and gauge locomotives transported slate and passengers to the larger Bangor and Aroostook Railroad in Abbot until 1943. The slate industry began to decline after World War I and most of the operations effectively ended. The Sheldon Slate Product Company was operating in Monson in the 1990s, while the Monson Maine Slate Co. and Kennedy Slate Co. continued in the 2000s The headstone of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s grave in Arlington National Cemetery is made from Monson slate.

In 1945, after a fire at Greenville&#x27;s Moosehead Woodcrafters resulted in the company buying a former slate company&#x27;s buildings that created Moosehead Manufacturing, which produced furniture products for over 60 years until its closure in 2007. The company had a sister plant located in Dover-Foxcroft, and a store in North Carolina, and shipped its products all over the state, country, and even as far away as Japan and other countries. The operation created many jobs for several generations, and it was not uncommon that fathers and sons, as well as mothers and daughters, would work together. The town was greatly impacted by the revenue and income generated by the company, and had as many as 250 workers who lived either in town or in several communities around the town.

Throughout its history, Monson has been greatly surpassed by its neighbors to the north by means of tourism. The town had a hotel, and even a steamboat that took people on trips on Lake Hebron in the late 19th century and early 20th century, but due to several causes, the hotel and many of the local businesses dealing with tourism in the early 20th century went into decline. Since the 1990s, Monson has increased again in tourism and, with the closure of Moosehead Manufacturing, many consider Monson (as well as much of Piscataquis County), to cater towards tourism. This is evidenced in the rise of antique shops, a new pub and lodging, and several similar businesses increasing on Main Street.

==Education==

Monson had a primary and secondary school known as Monson Academy. Although the school had begun classes in 1847, a longer-lasting building did not succeed (due to fires) until 1861. The school remained in session till 1968 when the buildings were remodeled and 7th through 12th grades began to be bussed to Dover-Foxcroft. Graduates from Foxcroft Academy are essentially graduates from Monson Academy, however no degree or ceremony is given for these graduates. There is also a small but remaining Monson Academy Alumni that consists mostly of people born between 1920 and 1950. The Academy also had won state basketball tournaments in the 1950s and 1960s and many of the trophies and other memorabilia from the school are held within the Monson Museum, and can be viewed. The school team was known as the Slaters and their colors were orange and black. A plaque near the original site of Monson Academy is also located near the entrance to the Monson Community Center.

Monson Elementary began operations in the 1980s and an extension was created in the 1990s that added room for a new library and school rooms. Due to a ruling by the MSAD 68 Board of Directors, residents of the town decided to close Monson Elementary after the 2008–2009 school year. Currently, all publicly educated students that reside in Monson are educated through MSAD 68. Pre-school, elementary and middle school students attend school at SeDoMoCha and high school students at Foxcroft Academy. There had been an effort to reorganize the school&#x27;s partnerships with either Union 60 in Greenville or MSAD 4 in Guilford. The former school briefly became a community center, and in 2017 was purchased by the Libra Foundation with the vision that it become an artists&#x27; space. The gymnasium remains town property and is used for craft fairs, an annual American Legion yard sale and other private/public events. The band stand on the property is still occasionally used, while the outdoor tennis and basketball courts have fallen into disrepair.

<doc id="116164" wikidata="Q3451760" url="?curid=116164" title="Arrowsic, Maine">
<text>Arrowsic is a town in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States. The population is 477 as of the 2020 United States Census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. During the French and Indian Wars, Arrowsic was site of a succession of important and embattled colonial settlements. It is a favorite with artists and birdwatchers.

==History==
Abenaki Indians called the island Arrowseag, meaning &quot;place of obstruction,&quot; a reference to Upper Hell Gate on the Sasanoa River. Until it was widened by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1898 and 1908, the stretch was choked with boulders and ledges. Indian canoe passage would have been risky in the swift current between Merrymeeting Bay and Sheepscot Bay.

In 1649, John Richards purchased Arrowsic from the sachem Mowhotiwormet, commonly known as Chief Robinhood. Richards then sold it in 1654 to Major Thomas Clarke and Roger Spencer, the latter selling his share in 1657 to Captain Thomas Lake. Clarke and Lake were Boston merchants, who built at Spring Cove on the island&#x27;s northeast corner a stockaded trading post and blockhouse protected by at least two great guns. In 1658–1659, land was cleared for pasturage, streets, a warehouse, sawmill, gristmill, bake house, blacksmith shop, cooperage and shipyard. Several large dwellings were erected, one called the Mansion House. Families and stocks of cattle were imported. The village became the local court of law, headquarters of the general council, and place of protection for settlers in the region.

But on August 14, 1676, during King Philip&#x27;s War, the settlement was destroyed. The evening before, an Indian woman appeared at the door of the Clarke and Lake fort seeking shelter. She was admitted, and in the dead of night quietly opened the gate. In rushed warriors, and in the which followed, 30 colonists were either killed and scalped or taken into captivity. Captain Thomas Lake, Sylvanus Davis and two others seized a canoe and paddled to Parker&#x27;s Island (now Georgetown), where all but Lake escaped alive from their pursuers. As the warehouse was looted and village burned to ashes, a brave sported the captain&#x27;s hat.

In 1679, returning settlers established a temporary settlement known as Sagadahoc on Stage Island, and petitioned the Massachusetts General Court for a permanent settlement on the southern end of Arrowsic Island. Governor Edmund Andros complied, granting 20 families Newtown. It was laid out with a common and, by order of the governor in 1688, a small, square palisaded fort on the ridge at the southern end of the island. But King William&#x27;s War broke out in May 1689, and by July, Newtown was destroyed and its garrison abandoned.

Signed in 1713, the Treaty of Portsmouth brought a truce between the Eastern (Abenaki) Indians and English settlements. Newtown was reestablished in 1714, then incorporated in 1716 as Georgetown-on-Arrowsic, named after King George I. Eventually, the town&#x27;s boundaries were extended to include Parker&#x27;s Island, Stage Island and the Plantation of Nequasset (present-day Georgetown, Phippsburg, Bath, West Bath and Woolwich).

During this time Fort Menaskoux was built and Samuel Penhallow was the commander. Beginning on August 9, 1717, Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute and Penhallow conducted a two-day conference on Arrowsic with delegates of various tribes, who arrived in a flotilla of canoes and encamped on Lee Island opposite the town. They objected to so many English forts in their territory, and Shute responded that he would build them wherever he thought necessary. Incidentally, the governor&#x27;s boat &quot;Squirrel&quot; ran aground on what has been known since as Squirrel Point. All the Indians helped him get free.
In the summer of 1723 during Dummer&#x27;s War, Arrowsic was attacked by the Norridgewocks and their 250 Indian allies from Canada. Incited by French missionary Sebastien Rale, they burned 37 dwellings and killed 300 cattle. The 40 inhabitants fled to the garrison, with only a child lost. When the fort could not be taken, the Indians disappeared upriver. During the French and Indian War, on June 9, 1758, marauding Indians shot Ebenezer Preble and a workman as they tended his farm on the northern end of the island. They then attacked his garrison, killing his wife and carrying away their 5 children to be sold as servants in Canada. It would be the last Indian massacre on the Kennebec River; next year brought the Fall of Quebec. On February 17, 1841, Arrowsic Island was set off from Georgetown and incorporated as the town of Arrowsic.

<text>Bath is a city in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States. Bath is included in the Brunswick micropolitan. Bath has a 2024 population of 8,870. It is also the county seat of Sagadahoc County. Bath is currently growing at a rate of 0.29% annually and its population has increased by 1.21% since the most recent census, which recorded a population of 8,764 in 2020. The city is popular with tourists, many drawn by its 19th-century architecture. It is home to the Bath Iron Works and Heritage Days Festival, held annually on the Fourth of July weekend. It is commonly known as &quot;The City of Ships&quot; because of all the sailing ships that were built in the Bath shipyards. Bath is part of the Portland-South Portland-Biddeford metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

Abenaki Indians called the area Sagadahoc, meaning &quot;mouth of big river&quot;. It was a reference to the Kennebec River, which Samuel de Champlain explored in 1605. Popham Colony was established in 1607 downstream, together with Fort St George. The settlement failed due to harsh weather and lack of leadership, but the colonists built the New World&#x27;s first oceangoing vessel constructed by English shipwrights, the &quot;Virginia of Sagadahoc&quot;. It provided passage back to England. Most of Bath, Maine, was settled by travelers from Bath, England.

The next settlement at Sagadahoc was about 1660, when the land was taken from an Indian sagamore known as Robinhood. Incorporated as part of Georgetown in 1753, Bath was set off and incorporated as a town on February 17, 1781. It was named by the postmaster, Dummer Sewall, after Bath in Somerset, England. In 1844, a portion of the town was set off to create West Bath. On June 14, 1847, Bath was incorporated as a city, and in 1854 designated county seat. Land was annexed from West Bath in 1855.

Several industries developed in Bath, including lumber, iron, and brass, with trade in ice and coal. The city and surrounding area is renowned for its shipbuilding and, at one point, was home to more than 200 shipbuilding firms. The industry began in 1743, when Jonathan Philbrook and his sons built two vessels. Since that time, roughly 5,000 vessels have been launched from Bath, which became the nation&#x27;s fifth largest seaport by the mid-19th century. The clipper ships built in Bath sailed to ports around the world. The last commercial enterprise to build wooden ships in the city was the Percy &amp; Small Shipyard, whose schooner &quot;Wyoming&quot; is considered the largest wooden ship in world history, and which was acquired for preservation in 1975 by the Maine Maritime Museum. The most well-known shipyard is the Bath Iron Works, which was founded in 1884 by Thomas W. Hyde. Hyde became the firm&#x27;s general manager in 1888. It has built hundreds of wooden and steel vessels, mostly warships for the U.S. Navy. During World War II, Bath Iron Works launched one new ship approximately every 17 days. The shipyard today is a major regional employer, and currently operates as a division of the General Dynamics Corporation.

In the Bath, Maine, anti-Catholic riot of 1854, an Irish Catholic church was burned.

The city is noted for its Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate architecture, including the 1858 Custom House and Post Office designed by Ammi B. Young. Bath is a sister city to Shariki (now Tsugaru) in Japan, where the locally built full-rigged ship &quot;Cheseborough&quot; was wrecked in 1889. Scenes from the movies &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Man Without a Face&quot; (1993) were filmed in Bath.

In 1915, Fred Cox, owner of Hallet&#x27;s Drug Store on Front Street, purchased the street clock standing at the corner of Front and Centre Streets from Boston, where it was built by Seth Thomas Clock Company four years earlier. It was moved from 70 Front Street to its current location in 1966, having been purchased by Harry Crooker. His family later donated it to the city, with the proviso that it be maintained and kept in a continuously operating condition, else it be returned to the family. The clock was restored in 2000. Crooker established local construction company in 1935. It was sold in 2014, after 79 years of family ownership.

===Cemeteries===

Bath has twenty known cemeteries. This is a relatively small number compared to neighboring communities (Phippsburg, for example, has over one hundred), because, from the early 1900s, Bath was densely populated, which left less room for family cemeteries.

The city maintains its &quot;big three&quot; cemeteries: Oak Grove, Maple Grove and Calvary. It also manages four smaller burials grounds: Dummer Sewall (Dummer and Beacon streets), David Trufant (claimed by author Parker McCobb Reed in 1894 to be the oldest burying ground in Bath; Spring and Middle streets), Pettingill (Riverview Road) and Fairview (on Fairview Lane). Only Pettengill has pieces of stones remaining, including that of a Revolutionary War veteran.

Graveyards not managed by the city, which tend to be old family plots, include Harrison (Stoney Island Road), Crawford (North Bath Road), Roberts-Edgecomb (North Bath Road), Edgecomb (North Bath Road), Purington (North Bath and Whiskeag roads), Ham (Ridge and Whiskeag roads), Ward (Bayshore Road) and the &quot;Irish&quot; ground (Varney Mill Road).

The Whittam (or Witham) graveyard (Bayshore Road) and Wise-Welch (North Bath Road), which includes Bath&#x27;s oldest documented burial in 1749, were identified in the 1970s, but are not found today.

Those found in sources, yet have no burials or exact locations identified, are South Street (possibly South and Washington streets), Marshall (Washington and Marshall streets), the &quot;Turnpike&quot; ground (likely in West Bath), and Marr&#x27;s Hill (in the area of Corliss and Washington streets).

There is also a Ward Cemetery.

<text>Bowdoinham is a town in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States. Bowdoinham was included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. The population was 3,047 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. The town is located on the west side of Merrymeeting Bay.

==History==

Fort Richmond was built upriver in 1719, protecting the area and encouraging British settlement. About 1720, the mouth of the Cathance River was first settled by Captain Gyles Watkins. But during Dummer&#x27;s War, in the summer of 1723 all buildings in the region were burned and cattle killed by the Norridgewocks and their 250 Indian allies from New France. The Kennebec River region was abandoned. When Gov. William Dummer&#x27;s Treaty of 1725 brought peace, it was resettled about 1730 by Abraham and Jonas Preble from York.

Litigation from two conflicting claims, however, slowed the town&#x27;s development. On July 3, 1637, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the lord proprietor of Maine, had granted this part of New Somersetshire to Sir Richard Edgcumbe of Mount Edgcumbe House, situated at Cremyll in Cornwall, England. But the Kennebec Company conveyed it in 1752 to William Bowdoin of Boston, older brother of James Bowdoin. The contested ownership went to court, whereupon Bowdoin won because Edgcumbe&#x27;s grant was found obsolete and indefinite. On September 18, 1762, the Massachusetts General Court incorporated it as Bowdoinham, named for William Bowdoin. It originally included Richmond, set off in 1823, and portions of Topsham and the Plantation of West Bowdoinham, set off in 1788 as Bowdoin.

Farmers grew apples, wheat, hay and potatoes. They also raised sheep. Shipbuilding was an important early industry which faded over time, with the first vessel launched in 1768, and the last of any size in 1912. By 1886, the town had three sawmills, a gristmill, plaster mill, two clothing factories, a cheese factory and about a dozen ice companies. It also produced boots and shoes, tinware, carriages and harness. Once a site of wharves to ship lumber and other goods, Cathance Landing became the town&#x27;s business center called Bowdoinham Village.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Situated beside Merrymeeting Bay, Bowdoinham is drained by the Cathance River, Abagadasset River, Muddy River and Kennebec River.

The town is crossed by Interstate 295 and state routes 24, 125 and 138. It borders the towns of Richmond to the north, Bowdoin to the west, and Topsham to the south.

<text>Georgetown is a town in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,058 at the 2020 census. Home to Reid State Park, the town is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area. Located on an island accessible by car from the mainland, Georgetown includes the villages of Five Islands, Georgetown, Bay Point, Marrtown, West Georgetown and Robinhood. It is a popular tourist destination.

==History==
Abenaki Indians called the island Erascohegan, possibly meaning &quot;good spear-fishing.&quot; Other interpretations of the word suggest that it meant &quot;a watching place.&quot; John Parker, a fisherman from Bedfordshire, England, purchased it in 1649 from Chief Mowhotiwormet, commonly known as Chief Robinhood, for a hogshead of rum and some pumpkins. Parker built the first permanent homestead on what eventually became known as Parker&#x27;s Island.

The Kennebec River valley was attacked and burned in 1676 during King Philip&#x27;s War, then again in 1689 at the outset of King William&#x27;s War, and was not resettled until after the 1713 Treaty of Portsmouth. The town of Newtown-on-Arrowsic was rebuilt in 1714 on the southern end of Arrowsic Island, which was incorporated in 1716 by the Massachusetts General Court as Georgetown-on-Arrowsic, named for Fort St. George. The town&#x27;s boundaries were extended to encompass Parker&#x27;s Island, Woolwich, Phippsburg and Bath (which included West Bath). Abandoned during Dummer&#x27;s War and beleaguered during the French and Indian Wars, the region resettled slowly in the 1750s until peace was assured with the 1759 Fall of Quebec.

About half of Parker&#x27;s Island provided grazing land, and some residents raised livestock and produced butter and cheese. In 1858, there were two sawmills, two shingle mills, a pailmaker and a shipbuilder. But the merchant marine and fishing were the town&#x27;s principal occupations. By 1841, all the other parts of Georgetown had been set off and incorporated as towns, leaving Parker&#x27;s Island with sole claim to the ancient name. Situated between the mouths of the Sheepscot and Kennebec rivers on the Gulf of Maine, Georgetown developed into a summer resort, attracting a number of prominent artists. The island is a noted site for bird watching.

==Geography==


According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, of it is land and is water. Georgetown is located on an island near the mouth of the Kennebec River and Gulf of Maine, part of the Atlantic Ocean.

It is crossed by Maine State Route 127. The island is separated by water from Westport to the northeast, Southport to the east, Phippsburg to the west, Arrowsic to the northwest, and Woolwich to the north.

<text>Phippsburg is a town in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States, on the west side of the mouth of the Kennebec River. The population was 2,155 at the 2020 census. It is within the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine, metropolitan statistical area. A tourist destination, Phippsburg is home to Bates-Morse Mountain Conservation Area, Fort Popham State Historic Site; it is also home to Fort Baldwin which overlooks Fort Popham, and Popham Beach State Park, as well as Pond Island National Wildlife Refuge. The town includes part of Winnegance.

==History==

Site of the Popham Colony, Phippsburg was—between 1607 and 1608—the first known English settlement attempt in New England. During its brief existence, colonists built &quot;Virginia of Sagadahoc&quot;, the first ship in Maine&#x27;s long history of shipbuilding.

The next British settlement at the mouth of the Kennebec River began in 1653; Thomas Atkins, a fisherman, purchased from the sachem Mowhotiwormet, commonly called Chief Robinhood, the southern end of Phippsburg (with the exception of Popham). Atkins Bay bears his name. The population gradually increased until King Philip&#x27;s War, when Indians in August 1676 attacked the eastern side of the Kennebec River, and scalping the colonists, or else carrying them into captivity. Dwellings were burned and stocks of cattle killed. The entire area was abandoned.

Resettlement commenced in 1679 at Newtown, located on the southern end of Arrowsic Island (across the river from present-day Phippsburg Center). About 1684, Francis Small had a trading post at Cape Small, which bears his name. But in 1689 the area was again destroyed and deserted during King William&#x27;s War. With the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1713, conflict was formally ended between the Abenaki Indians and English settlements. In 1714, Newtown was reestablished, then incorporated in 1716 as Georgetown-on-Arrowsic by the Massachusetts General Court. Also in 1716, the Pejepscot Proprietors established a little fishing village called Augusta at the Small Point Harbor area of Phippsburg. Dr. Oliver Noyes, director of the colony, erected a stone fort square to protect it. In 1717, Governor Samuel Shute held a conference at Georgetown-on-Arrowsic with tribal delegates, who arrived in a flotilla of canoes and encamped on Lee Island.

But in summer of 1723 during Dummer&#x27;s War, the Norridgewocks and 250 of their Indian allies from Canada, incited by the French missionary Sebastien Rale, attacked the area. Again it was deserted, with the stone fort destroyed. Governor William Dummer&#x27;s Treaty of 1725 restored peace, and in 1737 an attempt was made to resettle Cape Small Point. The boundaries of Georgetown-on-Arrowsic were enlarged to encompass most of present-day Phippsburg, Bath (which then included West Bath), Woolwich and Georgetown.

Slow resettlement of the Phippsburg peninsula found ten farms along the Kennebec River by 1751, with five more on the Casco Bay side. But the districts gathered into Georgetown-on-Arrowsic began splitting away; in 1759, Woolwich withdrew, followed in 1781 by Bath. In 1814, Phippsburg was set off and incorporated. The original petition requested that it be named Dromore after one of the town&#x27;s oldest sections, but Massachusetts chose instead to honor one of its royal governors, Sir William Phips—actually a native of Woolwich.

Between 1842 and 1890, wooden ships were built at Phippsburg. It also had numerous tidal mills.

Fort Popham was built during the Civil War to guard the mouth of the Kennebec, on the site of a much smaller battery built in 1808. It became the control center for an underwater minefield in the 1890s. The more modern Fort Baldwin was built between 1905 and 1912 and was garrisoned in both World Wars.

In 1891 Phippsburg ceded Ragged Island to Harpswell, but in 1917 it further added to its roster of islands by annexing nine Casco Bay islands including Bushy, Hen, Bear, Malaga, Burnt Coat, Black Snake, Wood, Little Wood, and Gooseberry Islands. Malaga was later offered to, but refused by, Harpswell.

During the Gilded Age, Popham Beach developed into a resort area, with steamboats transporting excursionists from Bath. Today, the town&#x27;s principal industries are fishing and tourism.

In 1971, Phippsburg was the site of the discovery of the Spirit Pond runestones, purported evidence of pre-Columbian European exploration of North America, considered widely a hoax by academics. The three stones were found by Walter J. Elliot, Jr., a carpenter from Bath, Maine. The runestones are now in the possession of the Maine State Museum in Augusta, Maine.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Connected to Bath by a bridge and causeway over Winnegance Creek and sharing a border with West Bath to the east of Winnegance, Phippsburg is on a peninsula dividing the Kennebec River from Casco Bay in the Gulf of Maine, part of the Atlantic Ocean.

Phippsburg is crossed by state routes 209 and 216. Separated by water, the peninsula is near the towns of Harpswell to the west, West Bath to the northwest, Bath to the north, Arrowsic to the northeast, and Georgetown to the east.

<text>Woolwich is a town in Sagadahoc County, Maine, United States. The population was 3,068 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. Woolwich is a suburb of the city of Bath located on the opposite shore of Merrymeeting Bay.

==History==

Called Nequasset after Nequasset Lake by the Abenaki Indians, it was first settled in 1638 by Edward Bateman and John Brown. They would purchase the land in 1639 from the sachem Mowhotiwormet, commonly known as Chief Robinhood, who lived near Nequasset Falls. At Day&#x27;s Ferry on the Kennebec River, Richard Hammond operated a fortified trading post. His household of 16, including servants, workmen and stepchildren, conducted a lucrative fur trade with the Indians. But in the first blow of King Philip&#x27;s War in the area, on the evening of August 13, 1676, warriors ingratiated themselves into the stockaded trading post, then killed the elderly Hammond and his stepson as they returned for the night. Others were either slain and scalped or taken into captivity. Buildings were looted and burned, and the cattle slain.

Nequasset was attacked during King William&#x27;s War, when inhabitants were again or forced to abandon their homes. It was assailed again in 1723 during Dummer&#x27;s War, when the Norridgewocks and their 250 Indian allies from Canada, incited by the French missionary Sebastien Rale, burned dwellings and killed cattle. Following Governor William Dummer&#x27;s peace treaty of 1725, resettlement would be slow. During the French and Indian War, on June 9, 1758, Indians raided the village, killing members of the Preble family and taking others prisoner to Quebec. This incident became known as the last conflict on the Kennebec River.

Nequasset had become a part of Georgetown, but on October 20, 1759, the plantation was set off and incorporated as a separate district by the Massachusetts General Court, named after Woolwich, England. On August 23, 1775 Woolwich was officially incorporated as a town.

The peninsula was heavily wooded, providing timber for shipbuilding. It also had excellent soil for agriculture. By 1858, industries included two sawmills, two gristmills, and a shipyard. By 1886, the community also produced bricks and leather.
The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers twice widened Upper Hell Gate on the Sasanoa River, which separates Woolwich from Arrowsic. Originally constricted by curves and ledges, which were made even more dangerous by swift currents, the half mile (0.8 kilometer) stretch was widened in 1898 to a minimum of , then again in 1908 to a minimum of and depth of . The Sasanoa River now permits navigation between Bath and Boothbay Harbor.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Woolwich is situated on a peninsula, with Merrymeeting Bay and the Kennebec River to the west, Sasanoa River to the southwest, and Back River to the southeast.

It is crossed by U. S. Route 1, and state routes 127 and 128. It borders the towns of Dresden to the north and Wiscasset to the east. Separated by water, it is near Bowdoinham to the west, Bath to the southwest, Arrowsic to the south, and Westport to the southeast.

Cambridge was originally part of Ripley, Maine. It was so named by a young girl studying in England. &quot;Bunker&quot; was the original family. The town also made news in late 2020 when a producer of a Barstool Sports podcast admitted to mercy-killing a local cat, Tig, and burying it in a nearby hunting camp after traversing a small creek while carrying Tig under one arm and somehow also carrying a shotgun.

The eclipse was to sweep across most of the United States, but as the date approached, cloudy skies were forecast for most of that path. However, Jackman was expected to have clear skies that day, so the town of less than a thousand residents was inundated by more than 10,000 visitors from across the country. Officials said it was probably the largest crowd ever seen in Jackman.

<text>Solon is a town in Somerset County, Maine, United States. The population was 978 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first known inhabitants were the Abenaki Indians, whom European settlers encountered in the early 1600s. At a rock ledge over the Kennebec River at Embden, 3 miles from the centre of Solon, there are Native American carvings dating to between 900-1400 CE. General Benedict Arnold and his troops camped below Caratunk Falls on October 7, 1775, before portaging their boats around the falls on the way up the Kennebec River to the Battle of Quebec. Originally called T1 R2 EKR, the plantation was known as Spauldingtown, after Thomas Spaulding, a grantee. It was settled in 1782 by William Hilton from Wiscasset, who purchased . On February 23, 1809, it was incorporated as Solon, named after Solon, a statesman and poet of Ancient Greece.

Agriculture was the principal occupation of the inhabitants. The surface of the town is uneven, the underlying rock is slate, but the sandy and occasionally gravelly loam produced good crops of hay and grain. Solon village was established at Fall Brook, its water power used to operate mills. By 1859, when the population was 1,419, there were two sawmills, a gristmill, a shovel handle factory, two fulling and two carding machines, and two blacksmiths. By 1886, the town&#x27;s industries included a carriage manufacturer and a harness maker.

Solon is the gateway to the Old Canada Road (U.S. Route 201), which from 1820 until 1860 served as the primary link between Lower Canada and Maine. The byway follows the Kennebec River valley through various villages and into the forests near the Canada–US border.

==Geography==

The town is crossed by U.S. Route 201, 201A and Maine State Route 8. It borders the towns of Bingham and Brighton Plantation to the north, Athens to the east, Cornville and Madison to the south, and Embden to the west.

==Marijuana legalization==
In 1992, the town of Starks made the first legal vote for marijuana legalization since the 1970s. Two ordinances written by Dave Wilkinson from neighboring Chesterville were voted on by thirteen Maine towns in the spring of 1992, an event which dominated the local news for a few weeks. One ordinance required that helicopters should not fly lower than 2000 feet over the town except in emergency. The other permitted the cultivation and possession of two pounds&#x27; dry weight of cannabis. Don Christen and Maine Vocals lobbied hard for votes. When Starks became the only town to pass both ordinances, it became national news. Wilkinson and other activists went to New York to appear on the &quot;Faith Daniels Show,&quot; the high point of the media attention. The following year, the ordinances were repealed.

Starks continues to serve as a focal point among proponents of marijuana legalization in New England. A local farmer, Harry Brown, has hosted weekend festivals, concerts, and rallies to support the repeal of cannabis prohibition on his hillside since 1991.

<text>Belfast is a city in Waldo County, Maine, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 6,938. Located at the mouth of the Passagassawakeag River estuary on Belfast Bay and Penobscot Bay. Belfast is the county seat of Waldo County. Its seaport has a wealth of historic architecture in several historic districts, and remains popular with tourists.

== History ==

The area was once territory of the Penobscot tribe of the Abenaki people, which each summer visited the seashore to hunt for fish, shellfish and seafowl. In 1630, it became part of the Muscongus Patent, which granted rights for English trading posts with the Native Americans, especially for the lucrative fur trade. 

About 1720, General Samuel Waldo of Boston bought the Muscongus Patent, which had evolved into outright ownership of the land, and was thereafter known as the Waldo Patent.
Waldo died in 1759, and his heirs would sell the plantation of Passagassawakeag (named after its river) to 35 Scots-Irish proprietors from Londonderry, New Hampshire. 

Renamed Belfast after Belfast, Northern Ireland, it was settled in 1770, and incorporated as a town in 1773. The village was mostly abandoned during the Revolution while British forces occupied Bagaduce (now Castine).
The British military burned Belfast in 1779, then held it for five days in September 1814 during the War of 1812.

Following the war, the seaport rebuilt and thrived. It was a port of entry, and designated county seat of Waldo County in 1827, although land would be set off in 1845 to form part of Searsport. Belfast was incorporated on August 17, 1850, as a city, the 8th in Maine, adopting its charter on April 3, 1852.
It developed into a shipbuilding center, producing hundreds of three, four and five masted schooners. Materials for wooden boat construction were shipped down the Penobscot River from Bangor, the lumber capital of North America during the later 19th century.

Shipbuilders became wealthy, and built the Federal, Greek Revival and Italianate mansions and civic architecture for which the city is noted, including the 1818 First Church by master-builder Samuel French, and the 1857 Custom House and Post Office by noted architect Ammi B. Young. Wooden ship construction would fade by about 1900, but with the advent of ice harvesting and refrigeration, the local economy shifted to distributing seafood, including lobsters, scallops, sardines, herrings and mackerel for the Boston and New York markets.

A county-wide connection to the main line of the Maine Central Railroad at Burnham, inland from Belfast, was established by the largely city-owned Belfast and Moosehead Lake Railroad with its opening in 1871. For the first 55 years the line was operated under lease by the MEC as its Belfast Branch but its operation reverted to the B&amp;ML on January 1, 1926, when the lease was terminated by the larger road. Regular passenger service ended in 1960, and all operations in Belfast of any kind ceased in 2005, when the main yard was torn up.
In 2011 the grounds of the former B&amp;ML main yard and adjacent Stinson Seafood factory became the site of the Front Street Shipyard. The railroad&#x27;s 1946 vintage engine house was torn down and its site is now occupied by the shipyard&#x27;s , five-story boatbuilding and repair facility. In 2016 the city opened a rail trail on a portion of the railroad right-of-way.

Shoe manufacture became an important business. After World War II, however, the Belfast economy was driven by its poultry industry, including two of the state&#x27;s larger processors, Maplewood and Penobscot Poultry. Waldo County farms supplied the factories with up to 200,000 birds a day. The annual Broiler Festival became a popular summer event, attracting both local people and tourists. But the poultry business collapsed in the mid-1970s during a national recession, devastating the city and surrounding towns. In the early 1980s, the defunct chicken-feed silos at the foot of Main Street, that once fed millions of chickens, were demolished. There was an exodus of people seeking employment prospects elsewhere through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. But as they left, people attracted to the natural beauty of the coast of Maine, inexpensive land and homes, some who came to go &quot;back to the land&quot;, artists and young college graduates moved in starting a renaissance.

In the early 1990s, credit card giant MBNA established two facilities in Belfast, one considerably larger than the other. The company was instrumental in establishing the Hutchinson Center of the University of Maine, an outpost of the University of Maine System, less than a mile from the main MBNA campus. Jobs provided by MBNA, which was acquired by the Bank of America, helped increase Belfast&#x27;s population significantly. Bank of America consolidated former MBNA operations in the larger of the two facilities. The smaller complex was eventually taken over by athenahealth. 

In 1996, shipbuilding was re-established on the Belfast waterfront with the opening of French &amp; Webb, Inc., classic wooden yacht builders and restorers. Following in their footsteps, Front Street Shipyard opened a major boatyard on the Belfast Bay in 2013. Together, the two boatbuilding companies have restored Belfast&#x27;s working waterfront and helped revive the city economy as well as appeal to tourists. Movies filmed in Belfast include &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1957), &quot;Thinner&quot; (1996) and &quot;In the Bedroom&quot; (2001) and the Frederick Wiseman documentary &quot;Belfast, Maine&quot; (1999) about everyday life in the city.

These three public elementary schools closed down in early 2000s (decade):

*Pierce School – Grades K–3 (Brief use as a private school)
*Anderson School – Grades K–3 (Now Waterfall Arts)
*Robertson School – Grades 3–5 (Not in use)

Schools Part of Belfast&#x27;s MSAD #34 District :

*Captain Albert Stevens Elementary School – Grades K–5 Consolidation of Pierce, Anderson and Robertson Schools (Located in Belfast)
*Ames School – Grades 3–5 (Located in Searsmont)
*Weymouth School – Grades K–2 (Located in Morrill)
*Drinkwater School – Grades K–5 (Located in Northport)
*Nickerson School – Grades K–5 (Located in Swanville)

*Belfast Area High School – Grades 9–12 (Located in Belfast)

Towns in Regional School Unit #71 as of winter 2020:

*Belfast
*Belmont
*Swanville
*Searsmont
*Morrill

In order to save money, many schools in the state of Maine were forced to combine with other districts. Due to consolidation, MSAD #34 (Belfast) combined with MSAD #56 (Searsport) in the fall of 2009. The MSAD&#x27;s no longer existed; they became one regional school unit, RSU #20. The RSU Superintendent was former Troy A. Howard Middle School and Belfast Area High School Vice Principal Bruce Mailloux. The former MSAD #56 towns of Searsport, Frankfort, and Stockton also became part of RSU #20.

Towns in the new RSU #20 District as of fall 2009 that were combined with MSAD #56:

*Belfast
*Belmont
*Swanville
*Searsmont
*Northport
*Morrill
*Searsport
*Frankfort
*Stockton Springs

Disagreements over inflating costs and the lack of local control over their students education caused several towns across Maine to consider withdrawing from these larger consolidated districts. One of these towns included Stockton Springs, which voted on March 25, 2014, to withdraw from RSU #20. At that time all eight municipalities within RSU #20 were at various points in the withdrawal process. These communities included Belfast, Searsmont, Stockton Springs, Belmont, Morrill, Northport, Searsmont and Swanville. Belfast voted in February 2014 to spend $25,000 to put together a report on the educational and financial impacts of leaving RSU 20.

Although consolidation was originally done to save money and increase the educational value of students from smaller towns, the consolidation was not widely perceived to be beneficial. Belfast, Belmont, Swanville, Searsmont, and Morrill withdrew from RSU #20 and established RSU #71.
